				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to improvement in seed-cum-fertilizer disc drill comprising power transmission device consisting of clutch controlled seed and fertilizer transverse shaft; depth regulating means for disc opener assembly by a hand lever through a square transverse bar; torque arm and spring loaded rod connected to the disc opener assembly; soil covering device by open centre double concave bevelled edge press wheel assembly with scraper plate as well as adjustable down pressure spring and adjustable lateral position of the device on back frame. Simple parking stand designated to prevent permanent set in the spring of the rod connected to the disc opener assembly.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Drill furrow openers and press wheels have been in use for years. Typically, a conventional seed drill will have a frame member pivotally attached to the implement frame with a spring means maintaining down pressure upon the frame member. Attached to the front portion of the frame member is the dragbar of disc opener with seed tube positioned within and behind the disc opener. Attached to the rear portion of the frame member is the press wheel for packing the opened furrow created by the disc opener.<br>
When using a conventional seed drill, typically a disc opener will penetrate the ground surface at a desired depth to create a furrow. The seed is placed within the opened furrow behind the disc opener. Typically a press wheel attached to the same frame member as the disc opener follows the disc opener for closing the furrow so that seed is completely enclosed with the soil.<br>
A problem occurs when the disc opener engages an object such as rock or a hardened piece of soil. When the disc opener is pushed up the object the press wheel is simultaneously lifted up since they are attached to the same frame member. The furrow containing the seed remains open with the seed undesirably exposed.<br>
Another problem occurs when the seed drill is kept in storage. The disc assemblies are commonly held in furrowing relationship to the ground by spring loaded pressure rod assemblies. A pressure rod has its lower end pivotally connected to the disc assembly and the upper end engages a torque arm and is free to move at an angle in vertical plane along direction of travel. A compression spring bears between the torque arm at the upper end and the disc assembly at the lower end biasing the assembly down but permitting upward deflection upon encountering an obstacle. The spring<br><br>
may develop a permanent deformation if retained in a distorted configuration for a long time. This can result in a permanent deflection of the disc assembly relative to the torque arm.<br>
Another problem occurs like clogging and bridging of the fertilizer in the hopper.<br>
Another problem occurs if seed and fertilizer drill gets power from single transport wheel. Its metering devices will stop whenever this wheel loses contact with ground due to low spot of the ground. Two transport wheels of disc drill can not be keyed on a single transverse axle like seed drill having shoe or tyne type furrow openers.<br>
Another problem occurs maintaining hydraulic system meant for raising or lowering disc openers.<br>
Hence, there is a need for simple and cost effective manual lever system for raising or lowering disc assemblies, press wheel system, parking stand, fertilizer metering with agitator system, individual row compartment in seed and fertilizer hopper for changing row spacing instead of individual clutches, clutches for continuous seed and fertilizer metering on transverse shafts that will overcome the shortcoming of prior art mechanism.<br>
Examples of seeding devices include U.S. Pat. No.4366760 to Dreyer; U.S. Pat. No.4977841 to Truax; U.S. Pat. No. 5626196 to Hughes; CA Pat. No.2030249 to Lafferty.<br>
While these devices may be suitable for particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for maintaining a constant disc opener depth and maintaining a constant packing of soil by the packer wheel when planting upon uneven surface. Conventional seeders tend to not operate effectively upon uneven ground surface leaving seed exposed either directly upon the ground surface or within the seed furrow.<br>
The disc opener and press wheel system according to the present invention substantially depart from the conventional concepts and design of prior art. In so doing provides a simpler apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of maintaining a constant disc opener depth and for maintaining a constant packing of soil by the press wheel when planting upon uneven surfaces.<br>
In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of seeding devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a simple a new disc opener and press wheel construction.<br><br>
The general purposes of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, are to provide new disc opener lifting mechanism and press wheel system that has many of the advantages of the seeding devices mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new depth adjusting lever for disc opener and press wheel.<br>
To attain this, the present invention generally comprises an array of single disc blade soil openers for creating seed trenches for the deposition of seed and fertilizer by seeder. A scraper assembly is attached to the convex sides of each disc blade. Each scraper assembly includes a mounting bracket with a toe shaped flat plate including a through bore extension, connecting the bracket to the axle of the respective disc blade.<br>
An arcuate slot extends through the fertilizer boot at the upper side thereof. Another vertical flat scraper plate extends from the slot downwardly at the concave side of the disc blade. This flat plate is inverse T-shaped at the bottom toward the disc blade. These scraper blades prevent soil blow out from outside and inside of the disc blades and push the soil over the seed and fertilizer trench back over the deposited seeds and fertilizer ahead of the trailing press wheels. A trailing press wheel acts as soil compactor for closing the soil trench behind the seeder.<br>
There is a rotatable means to vary the height of the disc opener from the ground. Disc openers are mounted on the said axle such that it is adapted in operation to rotate at an acute vertical and horizontal angle of 5 to 8 degrees with respect to the vertical plane containing the direction of travel of the drill with plane containing peripheral edge of the disc. This creates a furrow into which seed and fertilizer is deposited. Furthermore, inclination is such that when viewed from above, the inside concave surface of each dished disc faces upwardly to a very slight extent and when viewed from directly in front with respect to the direction of travel, faces forwardly to a very slight extant. Press wheel packs the soil over the seed and fertilizer in said furrows such that in operation one pass of the implement creates a plurality of evenly spaced rows approximately 225 mm apart. Although any spacing from 225 mm to 900 mm is possible with fertilizer incorporated in the soil adjacent but not touching said seed.<br>
The frame of the drill has a hitch on the forward portion thereof adapted to be towed by a tractor. The frame basically consists of six major beams. Under first of which at front is attached disc opener assemblies. The two at the side supports two drive wheels and hopper. A pair of cross beam supports weight of the drill in transport position. The last being at rear supports plurality of press wheel.<br><br>
In two rows, the disc assemblies are staggered both being creation of furrows and deposit of seed and fertilizer. The discs can be mounted rotate keeping concavity either to the left or to the right of the line of travel as long there are equal number of discs rotating in each direction. This will prevent tendency of the implement to move to the right or left. Fertilizer boot is situated forwardly and downwardly near to the disc whereas seed boot is situated at some distance backwardly and upwardly with respect to disc opener. Two separate flexible tubes one each for seed and fertilizer connecting each row compartment of hopper to boot are provided. Fertilizer is deposited approximately 25 mm deeper then seed. This has been found to be ideal position to deposit fertilizer that is to say 25 mm below and 25 mm to the side of the seed. Press wheel not only packs the soil over the seed but also covers the fertilizer with soil. Fertilizer to soil contact is less important than seed to soil contact.<br>
Disc assemblies are held in furrowing relationship to the ground by spring loaded pressure rod assemblies which rise or fall independently of each other when an external force such as a rock or other obstacle is encountered. The pressure rod has lower end assembled to the disc assembly, upper end is assembled to the torque arm and is free to move up and down in a vertical plane even at an angle. Torque arm is connected to a square transverse shaft by U-bolts. The spring is mounted in such a manner that its pressure can be adjusted. The disc assemblies can be raised or lowered with respect to wheels of the drill by means of hand lever. The press wheel assemblies are arranged on pivotal frame for up and down movement. The disc assemblies are lowered relative to the wheels for working. In the lower position, the weight of the machine is distributed between the wheels and disk assemblies with most of the weight being borne by the disc assemblies such that disc blades penetrate the ground a predetermined depth to form the furrow.<br>
Fertilizer metering device has variable orifices, spaced along the base of the hopper. Variable orifice is formed by a long horizontal plate having triangular holes sliding over another horizontal stationary plate having diamond shaped holes. Sliding plate is regulated by a hand lever. Dry and granular fertilizer band falls in the furrow. Agitator is a spur gear with augers at both sides of the gear through which a power driven square shaft passes that extends full length of the hopper. Agitator prevents fertilizer from bridging as the fertilizer is fed out. Augers pushes the fertilizer towards the centre of the row compartment where orifice is situated.<br>
Spur gear rotating in vertical plane right above the orifice breaks up lumps, and move the fertilizer across the opening into the delivery tube by gravity<br><br><br><br>
assisting in feeding and minimizing effect of fertilizer head change as the hopper empties.<br>

Description of preferred embodiment<br>
Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference character denote similar element, throughout several views. Typically a conventional seed drill will have a frame member pivotally attach to the implement axle shaft (25), (40). Figure (1) through (6), illustrate a disc opener (17) and open centre double concave press wheel system (20) which comprise a hitch (54), main box section frame or chassis (16) a'pair of vertical support frame for rectangular bracket for holding hopper (1), (2). One pair of cross angle iron (21) beam supports weight of the drill in transport position. Lids (3) are tightly fitted to keep out rain. One end of drag bar (31), pivotally attached to a T-bar (26). A compression spring loaded rod (12), lower end of which is pivotally positioned between fulcrum of the drag bar (31) and disc opener assembly (17). The rod (12) at the upper end is pivotally attached to one end of torque arm (11). Other end of torque arm (11) is fastened to transverse square shaft (9) by U-bolts. An depth adjusting hand lever (30) is rotatably attached to one end of the transverse square shaft (9) for raising of lowering disc opener assembly (17) with respect to ribbed drive wheels (13), (55). The lever is adjustably<br><br>
positioned between the section gear (34) with spring loaded single pin (35) meshed in any tooth of gear thus acting as lock for lever (30). The section gear (34) is attached to the side of vertical support frame (33). Pin (35) is attached to the lever (30) at some distance up from its end, and is movable engagement with gear member (34). Pin (35) can be positioned at any tooth of gear (34). The lever (30) has a handle (36) with bell and crank arrangement connecting to wire means (56) to pull pin (35) out of gear groove (34). Handle rotates the lever to any other position and releases it to put pin (35) into another groove, thus locking the lever in new position. While opposite end of lever (30) is rotatably engagement with transverse square shaft (9). Preferably a locking pin (35) of adjusting lever (30) is teethably attached to the gear (34) to prevent lever (30) shifting from locking position. Disc member (17) is attached to other and of drag bar (31). A compression spring (39) surrounds the rod (12) and is in compression between torque arm (11) and drag bar (31). The compression spring (39) aipplies downward force upon the disc opener (17) to insure the disc opener (17) is in engagement with ground surface.<br>
An approximately horizontal tension spring (32) connects lower vertical member (53) to the centre of press wheel hub (37). Tension spring (32) pulls the press wheel (20) to insure it is in engagement with ground surface. There is a provision to adjust its tension by nut and long bolt (57) and height by a plate (58) and vertical member(53) and having series of holes in vertical direction that allows user to adjust depth of press wheel (20). A plate member (38) in rotatably attached to top of the vertical member (33). It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that various other designs of spring means may be utilized to apply specified downward pressure upon the press wheel (20) to cover fertilizer and seed within the furrow.<br>
As shown in Fig. (2) through (3) of the drawings, the end of the drag bar (31) is rotatably attached to the T-bar (26). Other end of the drag bar (31) rotatably support a disc opener assembly (17). The disc opener assembly (17) penetrate the ground surface at a specified depth by the lever (30) as well as adjusting spring pressure rod (12) thereby creating a furrow for receiving fertilizer and seed. As further shown in Fig. (1) through (3) of the drawings, distal end of flexible spiral fertilizer (14) and seed tubes (15) are positioned within the fertilizer boot (18) and seed boot (19) respectively which drop fertilizer and seed in the furrow created by disc opener (17). Flexible seed tube (15) is connected to a conventional seed emitting means such as fluted roller (5) operated by a round shaft (52). Any suitable seed distribution system may be provided to deliver seed to the disc opener (17) and this may comprise a proprietary item and having a flexible tube (15) leading to disc opener (17). In order to deliver seed thereto at a pre-<br><br>
determined rate another flexible spiral tube for fertilizer application (14) is connected to fertilizer emitting means having spur gear agitator (6).<br>
In use, the user first adjust the lever (30) to have appropriate spring pressure in rod (12) to the disc opener (17). User adjust the position of the spring (32) to have a appropriate spring pressure applied to the press wheel (20). The user first presses handle (36) to lift the pin out of gear groove (34) by a wire (56) against a spring (52) pressure and positions lever (30) to an appropriate groove in the section gear (34). The user then further adjusts the compression spring (39) surrounding the rod (12), if appropriate pressure is not there. When in use, the disc opener (17) penetrates the ground surface at the desired depth creating a furrow. Fertilizer and seed are positioned about 25 mm deeper than seed and about 25 mm side of the seed within the furrow by the flexible fertilizer and seed tubes (14), (15) following the disc opener (17). When the disc opener (17) and press wheel (20) engages a hard object such as rock, the disc opener (17) and press wheel (2) are pushed upwardly one by one. This forces rod (12) to move up against compression spring (39) and also forces plate member (38) to move up against tension spring (32). After the hard object passes over, disc opener (17) and press wheel (20) returns to normal position due to release of pressure of springs (32), (39). Over running clutches (8), (41), (42), (43) at both sides of drill compensate for wheel slippage. To drive feeding mechanism, the hubs of both the transport wheels are equipped with pulleys (4), (44), (46), (47), (48) that drive through V-belts (24), (49) and other pulleys on seed and fertilizer transversal shafts. Idlers (27), (51) are used to keep V-belts in proper tension. Fertilizer agitator is a spur gear (6) with augers (7), (50) at both sides of the gear (6) through which power driven square shaft (10) passes, extends full length of the hopper. Augers (7), (50) push the fertilizer toward the center of row compartment and spur gear (6) move them across the opening into the delivery tube by gravity. Parking stand (23) prevents permanent set in compression spring (39) in storage condition. An assistant standing on foot board (22) checks proper fall of seed and fertilizer from hopper. Levers (28) and (29) are used to regulate fertilizer and seed rate respectively.<br>
