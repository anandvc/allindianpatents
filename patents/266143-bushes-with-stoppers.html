				<td>BUSHES WITH STOPPERS<br>
The invention is with regard to a bush comprising a core body, which is surrounded by at least one enveloping body, whereby the elastic connecting layer connects and distances the enveloping body and the core body to/from one another and, whereby, the core body and the enveloping body can be moved relative to one another.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Bushes of the type mentioned initially are already established in EP 1 736 681 A1. In the case of established bushes, the core body comprises a tube which is concentrically surrounded by a tube with a larger inner diameter. The two tubes are connected to one another by a layer of rubber, whereby the rubber layer is moulded to the tube.<br>
Established bushes are used as bearing elements in all types of motor vehicles. Established bushes exhibit rotation-symmetric rigidity properties when<br><br>
the inner tube is pushed against the outer tube. The rigidity properties are virtually frozen into the bush after its manufacture.<br>
In practice, it is, however, often necessary to set rigidity properties of the bush subject to the deflection of the core body to the enveloping body. It is, for example, desirable that the reset force that attempts to bring the core body and the enveloping body to their positions of rest and/or starting positions, be varied subject to the deflection.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention, therefore, is to design and further develop a bush of the type mentioned initially in such a manner that the same, after cost-effective manufacture, exhibits rigidity properties that can be adjusted subject to the deflection of the core body to the enveloping body.<br>
This objective is met in accordance with the invention by characteristics of patent claim 1.<br>
Accordingly, a bush of the type initially mentioned is characterised in that at least one stopper that is structurally separated from the connecting layer or manufactured so as to be separate from the connecting layer, is allocated to the core body and/or the enveloping body, said stopper restricting their relative movement.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, it has been established that at least one applicable stopper that is structurally separated from the elastic connecting layer permits impressing various rigidity properties upon the bush. Very precisely, it has been established that a stopper that has been manufactured apart from the connecting layer or separately manufactured can, according to the design of the connecting layer, be inserted into the bush by vulcanisation, for example. This stopper that can be used as a separate part can, in accordance with the invention, effect different reset forces in the case of a different extent of deflection. The stopper can be modified independent of the connecting layer. A bush that can be adjusted variably and that can be customised to a plurality of applications with regard to its rigidity properties, is designed in this connection. The objective initially mentioned is met as follows:<br>
With this as the background, it is conceivable that the elastic connecting layer exhibits recesses in which the stopper can be incorporated, whereby the recesses permit relative movement over a free stretch or across a free angle. These recesses cause resistance to the motion over a free stretch or across a free angle, said resistance to the motion being determined exclusively by the elastic connecting layer. A free angle occurs when the core body is twisted against the enveloping body. The elastic connecting layer produces torsion in the case of this type of twisting and counteracts with a reset force in the form of a torsional moment.<br>
The core body or the enveloping body could be moved over a free stretch or across the free angle against a first reset force. This precise design ensures that at least two characteristics could be impressed upon the bush. The first characteristic could thus be characterised by a first rigidity and the second characteristic by a second rigidity which takes effect upon contact of the core body or enveloping body with one of the stoppers.<br><br>
Against this background, the core body or the enveloping body could, after contact with the stopper, be moved over a braking distance or a braking angle against a second resistance to motion. In doing so, a bush can be produced with at least two characteristics.<br>
The stopper could be designed as an elastic body. Against this background, it is conceivable that the stopper be fashioned from rubber or elastomer. Rubbers and elastomers lend themselves to problem-free structuring in order to smooth out rigidity characteristic in the transition areas. Elastomers can be vulcanised to metallic objects without any difficulty. The design of the stopper as an elastic body permits setting of the second reset force and/or of the second characteristic of rigidity of the bush.<br>
The elastic connecting layer could exhibit recesses for modifying the radial and/or axial rigidity of the bush. Against this background, it is feasible that hollow parts of any geometric shape, which reduce or change the rigidity of the bush in at least one spatial direction, be formed in the elastic connecting layer.<br>
The core body could be designed to have several parts. The core body can be stabilised by this precise design. It is, furthermore, possible to increase the axial stretch of the core body by adding bodies that can be inserted or attached.<br>
The core body could comprise a receiver sleeve in which at least one plug-in body is incorporated. It is, furthermore, conceivable that one body is respectively inserted on both sides into the receiver sleeve, whereby the axial extent of the core body can be increased vis-a-vis the enveloping body. Plug-<br><br>
in bodies can be pasted into the receiver sleeve. It is, moreover, conceivable that the plug-in body be incorporated in the receiver sleeve by press fit,<br>
The plug-in body could exhibit an encroachment that abuts an opening rim of the receiver sleeve, which guarantees immovable contact of the plug-in body.<br>
A stopper could be located at the plug-in body. This precise design facilitates provision of stoppers that have other rigidity properties when compared to the elastic connecting layer. Plug-in bodies with stoppers that have different rigidity characteristics can be inserted, depending completely upon application of the bush. The bush, in this respect, can be customised in a probfem-free and modular manner to various application areas.<br>
The core body could consist of a receiver sleeve on which at least one plug-on body is located. This precise design facilitates stabilisation of the rim region of the receiver sleeve against deformation. Plug-on bodies can considerably strengthen the rim region of the receiver sleeve.<br>
The plug-on body could be located on a shoulder of the receiver sleeve and have a stopper. An immovable incorporation of the plug-on body can be achieved with this precise design. A modular design of the bush with regard to its rigidity properties is, furthermore, conceivable if the plug-on body with stoppers of varying elasticity can, namely, be attached to the receiver sleeve.<br>
The enveloping body can be designed to have many parts, whereby the enveloping body can be provided with stoppers in a modular manner in order to modify the rigidity properties of the bush.<br><br>
Against this background, the enveloping body can have at least one plug-in body with one stopper. The enveloping body can be strengthened against deformation in this manner.<br>
The enveloping body can have at least one plug-on body with a stopper due to which the axial extent of the enveloping body is increased. The enveloping body can, moreover, be strengthened against deformation .<br>
The core body could be located eccentric to the enveloping body. This type of bush has a larger free stretch at one radial direction than at the other. By creating smaller free stretches in a radial direction, the bush can be customised to a narrow installation space.<br>
At least one plug-in body or an plug-on body could encroach upon the receiver sleeve or the outer shell at an axial end and lie adjacent to the same at the front side. Force components can be guided onto the front side of the outer sleeve or of the receiver sleeve in this manner. A stable final position of the plug-in body or of the plug-on body is, furthermore, produced.<br>
There are now various possibilities regarding designing and development of the theory of the present invention in an advantageous manner. For this purpose, reference is made, on the one hand, to subordinate claims and, on the other hand, to the following explanation of the preferred exemplary embodiments of the bush, in accordance with the invention, with the help of the drawings.<br><br>
Designs and improvements of the theory preferred in general are also explained in connection with the explanation of the preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention by means of the drawings.<br>

EXECUTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a bush with a core body 1 that is surrounded by an enveloping body 2. An elastic connecting layer 3 connects the enveloping body 2 and the core body 1 to one another. The elastic connecting layer 3, furthermore, distances the enveloping body 2 from the core body 1. Core body 1 is moveable relative to the enveloping body. At least one stopper 4, which restricts movement of the core body relative to the enveloping body 2, is allocated to the enveloping body 2. At least one stopper 4 that is structurally separated from the connecting layer 3 or is manufactured separate from the connecting layer 3 is allocated to the enveloping body 2.<br>
Elastic connecting layer 3 has recesses 5 that serve to receive stoppers 4. Recesses 5 permit relative movement of the core body 1 with regard to the enveloping body 2 through a free stretch or a free angle.<br>
Core body 1 or the enveloping body 2 can be moved against a first reset force and a first resistance to the motion respectively through the free stretch or the free angle. The first reset force is determined by the rigidity of elastic connecting layer 3. After being moved against stopper 4, the core body can be moved over a braking distance or a braking angle against a second resistance that is determined by the rigidity of stoppers 4. The stopper 4 is designed as an elastic body.<br>
Enveloping body 2 has a multi-part design. To be precise, enveloping body 2 has a plug-in body 6 that is pushed into openings of a cylindrical outer sleeve 2a. Stoppers 4 are allocated to plug-in bodies 6. Stoppers 4 as well as the elastic connecting layer 3 are connected by vulcanisation to the core body 1,<br><br>
the enveloping body 2 and the plug-in bodies 6 respectively. Plug-in bodies 6 are ring-shaped. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the elastic connecting layer 3 has escape flanges 3a against which the stoppers 4 can come to rest.<br>
Although this is not illustrated in Figure 1, plug-in bodies 6 can be designed in such a manner that they encroach upon the outer sleeve 2a at the front i.e. at their axial ends. The plug-in bodies can adjoin the outer sleeve in an axial manner due to this encroachment in order to achieve a secure final position. !n this type of case, thickness of the outer sleeve 2a at its axial ends can, furthermore, be only marginally weakened since the largest force components can be guided onto the axiat end front surface of the outer sleeve 2a.<br>
Figure 2 presents a bush with a multi-part core body 1 that has a plug-in body 7. Stoppers 4 are allocated the plug-in bodies 7. The enveloping body 2 is designed as a single piece and is connected to the core body 1 by an elastic connecting layer 3. Elastic connecting layer 3 has recesses 5 that serve to receive stoppers 4. Core body 1 has a receiver sleeve 8 into which the plug-in bodies are pushed. Plug-in bodies 7 are respectively pushed in at the openings of the cylindrical receiver sleeve 8. Plug-in bodies 7 have encroachments 9 that abut an opening rim 10 of the receiver sleeve 8. Stoppers 4 that are designed as elastic bodies, are located at the plug-in bodies.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a bush with a multi-part core body 1 that has plug-on bodies 11 with stoppers 4. Core body 1 has a cylindrical receiver sleeve 8 that is surrounded by ring-shaped plug-on bodies 11. Enveloping body 2 is connected to core body 1 by an elastic connecting layer 3 that has recesses 5 to receive stoppers 4. Although the same is not illustrated in Figure 3, plug-on bodies 11 are designed in such a manner that they encroach upon the receiver<br><br>
sleeve 8 at the front side i.e., at their axial ends. As a result of this encroachment, the plug-on body 11 can adjoin the receiver sleeve 8 in an axial manner in order to achieve a secure final position. The thickness of the receiver sleeve 8 in such cases can, furthermore, be only marginally weakened since the largest force components can be guided onto the axial end front surface of the outer sleeve 8.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a bush with a core body 1 and an enveloping body 2, whereby the enveloping body 2 has a multi-part design. Enveloping body 2 has plug-in bodies 6 at which stoppers 4 are located. Core body 1 is connected to enveloping body 2 by an elastic connecting layer 3 that has rounded corner regions 12.<br>
Figure 5 presents a bush in which the enveloping body 2 is connected to the core body 1 by an elastic connecting layer 3 in which a stiffening element 13 is located. In addition, Figure 5 illustrates a receiver sleeve 8 in which plug-in bodies 7 are located with stoppers 4. Stiffening element 13 is ring-shaped and modifies the rigidity of connecting layer 3 in which it is embedded.<br>
Figure 6 presents a bush with an enveloping body 2 and a core body 1 that are connected to one another by an elastic connecting layer 3. In the bush according to Figure 6, stoppers are alternately located at the enveloping body 2 as well at the core body 1.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a bush with an enveloping body 2 and a core body 1 that are connected by an elastic connecting layer 3 which has rounded corner regions 12. Core body 1 has a receiver sleeve 8 onto which plug-on bodies 11 with stoppers 4 are mounted.<br><br>
Figure 8 presents a bush with an enveloping body 2 and a core body 1 that are connected to one another by an elastic connecting layer 3 which has chamfers 14. The bush according to Figure 8 has stoppers 4 that are located alternately at the core body 1 and the enveloping body 2.<br>
Figure 9 presents a bush with an eccentric configuration of the core body 1 relative to the enveloping body 2. This bush has a greater free stretch in the radial direction than in another direction. The bush can be customised to narrower installation spaces by creating smaller free stretches. The bush has plug-in bodies 6 with stoppers 4 that are inserted into the outer sleeve 2a of the enveloping body 2. Core body 1 is connected to the multi-part enveloping body 2 by an elastic connecting body 3 which has recesses 5.<br>
Stoppers 4 and elastic connecting layers 3 in the exemplary embodiment described here are manufactured from elastomers, especially rubber. Outer sleeve 2a, receiver sleeve 8, plug-in bodies 6, 7 and plug-on bodies 11 are connected through vulcanisation to the previously mentioned elastomers or pasted to the same. Stoppers 4 and the elastic connecting layer 3 can thus be made from various elastomers in order to impress different rigidity characteristics upon the bush. In the exemplary embodiments according to Figures 1 to 9, the elastic connecting layers 3 can be connected to core body 1 and/or to the enveloping body 2 by vulcanisation. A force-fit connection of the core body 1, the enveloping body 2 and the connecting layer 3 is alternatively also conceivable.<br>
With regard to the advantageous designs and improvements of the theory in accordance with the invention, reference is made, on the one hand, to the general part of the description and, on the other, to the enclosed patent claims.<br><br>
In conclusion, it has to be emphasised that the previously selected exemplary embodiments serve only to discuss the theory in accordance with the invention but not, however, to restrict the same to these exemplary embodiments.<br><br><br>
