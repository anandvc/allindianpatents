Breastpump set<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a breastpump set, a<br>
breastshield and a connecting tube according to the<br>
preambles of patent claims 1, 8, 15 and 17.<br>
Prior art<br>
Breastpumps for expressing human breastmilk are well<br>
known. There are basically two different types. The<br>
first are operated manually, i.e. the vacuum needed for<br>
milk expression is generated by manual actuation of the<br>
suction pump. In the second type, the suction pump is<br>
driven electrically, in which case the suction pump can<br>
be connected to the mains electricity and/or can be<br>
operated by a battery or another energy storage means.<br>
To ensure that the function of the breastpump can be<br>
adapted optimally to the needs of the mother, some of<br>
the pumps allow the mother to regulate the vacuum. For<br>
example, US 2004/0024351 and US-A-4,813,932 disclose<br>
manually actuated breastpumps that have adjustable<br>
valves. In the case of manually operated pumps, the<br>
suction capacity of the pump itself is additionally<br>
regulated by means of the mother increasing or<br>
decreasing the pump strength to meet her requirements.<br>
In electrically driven pumps too, it is customary for<br>
air release means to be arranged on the breastshield or<br>
on the connecting line to the suction pump. This is the<br>
case in US 6,706,012 and US 6,042,560, for example.<br>
US 6,110,140 proposes a manually or electrically<br>
operated breastpump which, in the area of the<br>
breastshield, has a vacuum regulator for regulating the<br>
vacuum generated by the suction pump. This regulator<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 2 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
can be actuated during use of the breastpump, such that<br>
the vacuum prevailing in the breastshield can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
In addition to the solutions described above, which all<br>
allow the vacuum generated by the suction pump to be<br>
modified in the area of the breastshield, some<br>
electrically driven breastpumps also afford the<br>
possibility of modifying the vacuum or the suction<br>
rhythm on the pump unit itself. This is done via<br>
corresponding actuation switches or buttons that are<br>
arranged on the suction pump. However, to be able to<br>
actuate these buttons, the mother has to have one hand<br>
free. This is not possible, however, especially if the<br>
mother wishes to express milk from both breasts<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to allow the<br>
mother to operate the suction pump as easily as<br>
possible.<br>
This object is achieved by a breastpump set, a<br>
breastshield and a connecting tube with the features of<br>
patent claims 1, 8, 15 and 17.<br>
The breastpump set according to the invention for<br>
expressing human breastmilk comprises a breastshield to<br>
be placed on a mother's breast, a milk collection<br>
container, and an electrically driven suction pump, in<br>
which the breastshield has an operating means for<br>
operating the suction pump.<br>
By virtue of the breastpump set according to the<br>
invention, the mother is therefore able to influence<br>
the function of the suction pump without having to be<br>
able to reach the latter. The mother can use the same<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 3 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
hand with which she is holding the breastshield to her<br>
breast. She can therefore express milk from both<br>
breasts simultaneously or use the free hand for<br>
something else.<br>
The operating means is preferably arranged nearby on<br>
the breastshield funnel.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the operating means is<br>
arranged facing upward or sideways in the position of<br>
use of the breastshield, to ensure that said operating<br>
means is easily accessible. However, depending on the<br>
shape and configuration of the breastshield, other<br>
locations are also possible for the placement of the<br>
operating means, preference being given to locations<br>
that are easily accessible and correspond to the<br>
natural position adopted by the mother as she expresses<br>
milk. Moreover, the operating means can also be<br>
arranged on a part of the breastshield that can be<br>
folded open, plugged on or removed, with the result<br>
that the operating means is exposed only when the<br>
mother wishes to use it.<br>
Depending on the embodiment, the suction pump can be<br>
switched on and off by the operating means. In<br>
addition, or as an alternative to this, its pumping<br>
capacity can also be modified according to the<br>
requirements of the mother.<br>
If a suction pump is used that can operate two<br>
breastshields simultaneously, then, depending on the<br>
design of the suction pump, only one of the<br>
breastshields is provided with the operating means, and<br>
the suction pump operates both breastshields in<br>
accordance with the same operating signals. If the<br>
suction pump is able to operate the two breastshields<br>
with different suction rhythms or pumping capacities,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 4 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
both breastshields can be provided with an operating<br>
means in order to individually adjust the suction pump.<br>
The signals can be sent from the operating means to the<br>
suction pump mechanically, by wireless transmission, or<br>
via corresponding cable connections. In the case of<br>
wireless transmission, it is possible, for example, to<br>
use a radio antenna, an infrared interface, a Bluetooth<br>
signal transmission, or another of the known types of<br>
wireless transmission. The cable connection is<br>
preferably effected via an electrical signal in a known<br>
manner.<br>
Instead of an operating means, it is also possible to<br>
use a voice recognition means, which then transmits a<br>
control signal to the suction pump. This voice<br>
recognition means can be arranged in the area of the<br>
breastshield, directly on the suction pump, or on an<br>
additional external unit connected to the suction pump.<br>
The breastshield preferably comprises a main body<br>
formed by one piece, in which the operating means and<br>
any connecting cables for signal transmission are<br>
arranged. To keep the costs of such breastshields as<br>
low as possible, however, the main body can also be<br>
formed of several pieces, in which case, for example, a<br>
breastshield funnel is designed as a disposable product<br>
and at least the part with the operating means is able<br>
to be reused.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments are set forth in the<br>
dependent patent claims.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The subject matter of the invention is explained below<br>
on the basis of preferred illustrative embodiments<br>
depicted in the attached drawings, in which:<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 5 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>

a third embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows a view of a breastpump set according to<br>
a fourth embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 5 shows a view of a breastshield according to a<br>

Figure 6 shows a view of a breastshield according to a<br>
sixth embodiment.<br>
Embodiments of the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of the breastpump set<br>
according to the invention. It basically comprises at<br>
least one breastshield 1, a milk collection container 2<br>
that can be secured on the breastshield 1, and an<br>
electrically driven suction pump 4, which is connected<br>
to the breastshield 1 via a suction line 3.<br>
The breastshield 1 has a breastshield funnel 10, which<br>
is placed on the mother's breast during use. The funnel<br>
10 merges into a breastshield neck 11, which is<br>
adjoined by first and second breastshield coupling<br>
parts 12, 13. The first breastshield coupling part 12<br>
has an inner thread that can be screwed onto an outer<br>
thread of the milk collection container 2, here a<br>
baby's bottle. The second breastshield coupling part 13<br>
has an attachment (not visible in the figure) into<br>
which the suction line 3, here a tube, can be fitted.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 6 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
The other end of the tube can be fitted in the suction<br>
pump 4. The vacuum or underpressure generated in the<br>
suction pump is applied by way of this tube to the<br>
breastshield, such that the milk is expressed from the<br>
mother's breast and can be collected in the milk<br>
collection container 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows the customary position of use. The first<br>
coupling part 12 is directed downward, and the second<br>
coupling part 13 is directed rearward or obliquely<br>
downward, in any case away from the mother's breast.<br>
The suction pump 4 can be one of the known motor-driven<br>
suction pumps. It preferably has actuating and control<br>
keys or buttons 40 and a display 41. In the<br>
illustrative embodiment shown here, it is designed as<br>
an independent, portable unit.<br>
According to the invention, the breastshield 1 now has<br>
an operating means, here in the form of an operating<br>
panel 5, via which the suction pump 4 can be operated.<br>
This operation is preferably performed independently of<br>
the setting of the actuating and control keys or<br>
buttons 40 arranged on the suction pump 4.<br>
The operation can involve the switching on and off of<br>
the suction pump 4, but also the adjustment of the<br>
suction rhythm, the suction curve, the suction<br>
capacity, the intervals between individual cycles, etc.<br>
The operating panel 5 is preferably arranged in the<br>
area of the breastshield funnel 10. In the example<br>
shown here, it is secured on or fitted into the<br>
breastshield neck 11 adjacent to the funnel 10. It is<br>
preferably directed upward in the position of use shown<br>
here, such that it can be reached by the same hand with<br>
which the mother is holding the breastshield 1 to her<br>
breast. However, the operating panel 5 can also be<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 7 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
arranged on the side or bottom of the neck 11, for<br>
example.<br>
The operating panel 5 is secured on or in the<br>
breastshield 1 by known means. The main body of the<br>
breastshield 1 itself is usually made of plastic and is<br>
designed in one piece or several pieces. The operating<br>
panel 5 can, for example, be cast into this main body<br>
or affixed to it by adhesion. In the latter case, the<br>
main body can have a suitable recess in which the<br>
operating panel 5 can be fitted, such that the latter<br>
does not protrude too far and is thus protected. Any<br>
cables for signal transmission can be connected in the<br>
same way to the breastshield 1 or integrated in it.<br>
The operating panel 5 can comprise switches, push keys,<br>
sensor keys, rotatable knobs, slides or other known<br>
means, such that the mother can transmit the desired<br>
control signals to the suction pump 4 and to the<br>
control system 42 arranged therein.<br>
In the illustrative embodiment shown here, the signals<br>
are transmitted from the breastshield 1 to the suction<br>
pump 4 via a signal line 6. This line can run separate<br>
from the suction line 3 and can also be connected via<br>
other attachment points to the breastshield 1 and to<br>
the suction pump 4. However, a connecting tube is<br>
preferably used that contains both the suction line 3<br>
and also the signal line 6. Depending on the design,<br>
there can be more than one suction line 3 and more than<br>
one signal line 6. The at least two lines 3, 6 are<br>
preferably connected to one another along their entire<br>
length. For example, they are co-extruded or, after<br>
being produced separately, are encapsulated together.<br>
At both ends, they have plugs that can be fitted into<br>
corresponding sockets in the breastshield 1 and the<br>
suction pump 4.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 8 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
If two breastshields 1 are attached to the same suction<br>
pump 4, there are of course two connecting tubes with<br>
suction lines 3, in which case both tubes or only one<br>
of them can additionally have a signal line 6.<br>
An alternative embodiment is shown in Figure 2.<br>
Identical parts have been provided with the same<br>
reference numbers. Here, the signals are not sent from<br>
the breastshield 1 to the suction pump 4 via a line,<br>
but instead by wireless transmission, preferably by<br>
radio. An antenna 50 is shown here as one<br>
representative of all the possibilities of wireless<br>
transmission, and it will be noted that the presently<br>
available antennas can generally be integrated into the<br>
breast shield 1 in a planar manner.<br>
In the illustrative embodiments according to Figures 3<br>
and 4, the milk collection container 2 is not shown. It<br>
is, however, screwed onto the first coupling part 12 in<br>
the known manner. In contrast to the above embodiments,<br>
the suction pump is in this case a suction pump unit 4'<br>
that is secured directly on the second coupling part 13<br>
of the breastshield 1. Such suction pumps usually have<br>
a battery or another energy storage means, which is<br>
likewise arranged in this unit 4' . The suction pump<br>
unit 4' is secured on the breastshield 1 in a known<br>
manner, for example by a screw connection, clamping<br>
means, or another form-fit or force-fit securing means.<br>
To ensure that it can be easily reached by the fingers,<br>
the operating panel 5 of the pump 4' is not arranged on<br>
the unit itself, but instead on the breastshield 1,<br>
preferably in the area of the funnel 10 as before. In<br>
this case too, the neck 11 of the shield 1 has proven<br>
to be a particularly suitable location.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/079229	- 9 -		PCT/CH2005/000730<br>
In Figure 3, the operating panel 5 has at least one,<br>
preferably several keys 51, and in Figure 4 it has at<br>
least one rotatable knob 52.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 5, the operating<br>
panel 5 is protected by a flap 53 that can be folded<br>
open. In Figure 6, the operating panel 5 can be plugged<br>
on, in which case the breastshield neck 11 has a<br>
corresponding recess 100 with pins that engage in<br>
securing holes of the panel 5.<br>
The signals can again be sent to the suction pump unit<br>
4' via signal lines or by wireless transmission. If<br>
signal lines are used, the contact or connection<br>
between the line sections routed in the breastshield 1<br>
and in the suction pump unit 4' is preferably made<br>
automatically when the pump 4' is coupled to the shield<br>
1.<br>
The breastpump set according to the invention thus<br>
permits easy operation of the suction pump and<br>
eliminates the need for the mother to have onehand<br>
free for handling it.<br>

A breast pump set for expressing human breastmilk comprises a breastshield (1) to be placed on the female breast<br>
with a coupling pan (12) for connection to a milk collection container (2), and an electrically driven suction pump (4, A"). The<br>
breastshield (1) is provided with an actuator (5) for actuating the suction pump. The inventive breast pump seat allows easy handling<br>
of the suction pump and eliminates the need for the mother to have a hand free for handling.<br>
