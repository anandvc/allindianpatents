METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAINTENANCE AND EXPANSION OF HEMOPOIETIC STEM CELLS AND/OR<br>
PROGENITOR CELLS<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for maintenance and expansion of hemopoietic stem cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to a three dimensional stoma cell plug flow bioreactor for the maintenance and/or expansion of hemopoietic stem cells and/or for the production of a conditioned medium for the maintenance and/or expansion of hemopoietic stem cells. The hemopoietic system in mammals is composed of a heterogenous population of cells that range in function from mature cells with limited proliferative potential to pluripotent stem cells with extensive proliferative, differentiate and self renewal capacities (1-3). Hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) are exclusively required for hemopoietic reconstitution following transplantation and serve as a primary target for gene therapy. In spite of the key role of stem cells in maintaining the hemopoietic system, their extremely low frequency in hemopoietic tissue, as well as the limited ability to maintain or expand undifferentiated stem cells under ex-vivo conditions for prolonged periods of time, not only remains a major drawback to essential clinical applications of these cells, but also reflects the current unavailability of, and the need for, novel stem cell regulators.<br>
It is widely accepted that stem cells are intimately associated in vivo with discrete niches within the marrow (4-6), which provide molecular signals that collectively mediate their differentiation and self renewal, via cell-cell contacts or short-range interactions (7). These niches are part of the "hemopoietic inductive microenvironment" (HIM), composed of marrow stromal cells,  e.g.,  macrophages,  fibroblasts.<br><br>
adipocyte and endothelial cells (8). Marrow stromal cells maintain the functional integrity of the HIM by providing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and basement membrane components that facilitate cell-cell contact (9-11). They also provide various soluble or resident cytokines needed for controlled hemopoietic cell differentiation and proliferation (12-14).<br>
In view of the above, it is not surprising that efforts to develop culture systems for the prolonged maintenance of human HSC were mainly focused on the use of pre-established primary marrow stromal cell monolayers. These included long-term cultures of unpredicted (Dexter cultures, 15) or irradiated (16-19) primary human marrow stroma, as well as human or murine stromal cell lines (16, 19-24), with or without exogenously added cytokines. Output assays for HSC initially relied on the capacity of such cells to produce myeloid progeny (long-term culture initiating cells; LTC-IC) or to generate colonies with cobblestone morphology (cobblestone area forming cells; CAFC) after prolonged culture (5-7 weeks) on such stromal cells (16,17), In spite of the widespread use of LTC-IC and CAFC assays, it is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that they detect highly primitive progenitors, rather than true repopulating hemopoietic stem cells (25,26).<br>
A recently developed human stem cell assay detects a SCID repopulating cell (SRC), which homes to the bone marrow of non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice (27), where it gives rise to human myeloid, lymphoid, elytroid and CD34+ progenitor populations (28-30). The SRC is exclusively found in hemopoietic cell fractions expressing the CD34+38- surface antigen (31) and its frequency in CB (1/3x10’ cells) is enriched as compared to BM (l/9xl05 cells) or mobilized PB (1/ 6x10’ cells) (32).   Very recent studies showed that the SRC resides within a<br><br>
subpopulation of CD34+/38-/CXCR4+ cells (33). CXCR4, a surface receptor for the chemokines stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1, 34), is apparently essential for homing and engraftment of human hemopoietic stem cells in the NOD/SCID marrow (33).<br>
Studies aimed at inducing prolonged maintenance/expansion of human HSC on stromal cell cultures were mainly based on CAFC, LTC-IC or the CD34+38- phenotype as end-point assays (16, 19-24). Rare reports of SRC maintenance/expansion in stromal cell cultures fail to indicate significant long-term support. For example, allogeneic human marrow stroma was found to induce short-term (7-day) SRC maintenance, followed by a rapid, marked decline (6-fold) in activity (26). The inability to support the long-term maintenance/expansion of transplantable human stem cells on stromal cell layers, may be attributed to several factors related to in vitro cultures of these cells. Among these, one may include the use of stromal cell monolayers, which do not reflect the in vivo growth conditions within the natural, three-dimensional structure of the bone marrow. Such conditions may diminish the capacity of stromal cells to provide the optimal, appropriate supportive microenvironment, as well as the capacity of stem cells to localize in specific niches and to physically interact with stromal cells and their products. Indeed, evidence for the importance of a three dimensional (3D) structure for the biological activity of hemopoietic progenitor cells, is provided by the superior growth of a human hemopoietic cell line on stromal cells seeded in a 3D collagen matrix, as compared to their proliferation on monolayers of such cells (35). More importantly, a 3D tantalum coated porous biomaterial, was recently shown to enhance the short-term maintenance of macaque LTCIC or CD34+38- cells, as compared to cells cultured alone or on marrow stromal cell monolayers<br><br>
(36).   The effect of stromal cell-coated 3D carriers, was, however, not investigated.<br>
Recent studies have shown the murine AFT024 cell line to be superior than human stroma, in supporting 2-3 week survival and maintenance (albeit not expansion) of human CB SRC (37). This line has been found to express several novel HIM genes encoding membrane-bound proteins (21, 38, 39), which may have an essential role in stem cell physiology. The possible expression of these and other genes by stromal cells under conditions which more closely mimic their 3D marrow microenvironment, and thus enable their optimal, physiological functional activity, has yet to be determined.<br>
Extensive studies have shown that stroma non-contact cultures (19, 21, 22, 40, 41) or stroma conditioned media (SCM) (21, 42-44), alone or with cytokines, can support the ex-vivo maintenance or expansion of primitive hemopoietic progenitors. SCM has also been shown to improve the recovery and transduction efficiency of such cells (45, 46). While these findings again stress the importance of soluble stromal cell factors, the use of LTC-IC, CAFC or CD34+38- end-points in such assays cannot reflect the effect of SCM on maintenance/expansion of transplantable HSC. Furthermore, it is not known whether such SCM, obtained from monolayer cultures of stromal cells, indeed contains all stromal cell-associated gene products involved in human HSC physiology.<br>
Recent attention aimed at ex-vivo expansion of transplantable hemopoietic stem cells has focused on the establishment of cytokine-supplemented suspension cultures (47-53). These studies have helped identify the major relevant cytokines for this process, e.g., early-acting ones such as stem cell factor (SCF), FLT3 ligand and thrombopoietin<br><br>
(TPO). Nevertheless, variable results have been obtained, indicating short-term loss (48, 49), maintenance (50-52) but also some rare examples of SRC expansion, following during 2-4 weeks of culture (47, 53). The interactive capacity of these cytokines and stromal cells, under 3D grow’ conditions, to support the maintenance/expansion of SRC, has not yet been defined.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a method and apparatus for ex-vivo expansion and/or maintenance of transplantable hemopoietic stem cells devoid of the above limitations, with superior results as is compared to the teachings of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
While reducing the present invention to practice, a plug flow bioreactor system which closely mimics the 3D bone marrow microenvironment and which is capable of supporting the growth and prolonged maintenance of stromal cells, has been developed. The latter were seeded on corrosive inorganic carriers made of a non woven fabric matrix of polyester (54), enabling the propagation of large cell numbers in a relatively small volume. The structure and packing of the carrier have a major impact on oxygen and nutrient transfer, as well as on local concentrations and released stromal cell, products (e.g., ECM proteins, cytokines, 55). In addition, the capacity of stromal cells cultured in this system to promote the maintenance/expansion of transplantable human hemopoietic stem cells via direct cell-cell contact has been determined to be far superior over prior art methods. Furthermore, the capacity of conditioned medium of stromal cells cultured in this system to promote the maintenance/expansion of transplantable human hemopoietic stem<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of methods and bioreactor for hemopoietic stem cell expansion/maintenance which can be used for transplantation in a recipient or for other purposes as if further detailed herein under. Specifically, the present invention is of a three dimensional stromal cell plug flow bioreactor for the maintenance and/or expansion of hemopoietic stem cells and/or for the production of a conditioned medium for the maintenance and/or expansion of hemopoietic stem cells, which can be used in a variety of applications.<br>
The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
Current strategies aimed at long-term ex-vivo maintenance or expansion of transplantable human hemopoietic stem cells (HSC), have so far been met with limited success. A novel three dimensional (3D) plug flow bioreactor which closely mimics the bone marrow microenvironment and which is capable of supporting the growth and<br><br>
prolonged maintenance of marrow stromal cells is described herein. The latter are seeded on corrosive carriers made of a non woven fabric matrix of polyester, packed in a glass column, thereby enabling the propagation of large cell numbers in a relatively small volume. In the examples provided in the Example section that follows, the bioreactor was seeded with the murine 14FL1 stromal cell line or alternatively with primary human marrow stromal cells. By day 40 following seeding, the carriers contained a 100-fold increased cell density. The density at various levels of the column was the same, indicating a homogenous transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the cells. Media conditioned by stromal cells within the bioreactor (3D SCM) was superior to stromal cell monolayer (2D) SCM, in supporting the long-term maintenance of human cord blood (CB) CD34+38- cells. 3D SCM was also capable of supporting the expansion of CD34+38-CXCR4+ cells, which represent SCID/NOD repopulating cells (SRC). In the presence of cytokines (FLT3 ligand and TPO), 3D SCM enhanced stem cell self renewal and inhibited differentiation, while the opposite effect was induced by 2D SCM + cytokines. Three dimensional stromal-stem cell cocultures also exhibited superior maintenance of CD34+38- cells than cocultures on monolayer stromal cells. These findings demonstrate that the 3D plug flow bioreactor provides a suitable system for ex-vivo maintenance/expansion of human HSC via superior stromal-stem cell contact and perhaps via stromal cell production of known and/or novel stem cell regulators.<br>
The human HSC is an essential target for transplantation and gene therapy. The highly reduced frequency of HSCs, as well as the current unavailability of growth factors capable of inducing stem cell self renewal in the absence of terminal differentiation, still provide a major hindrance<br><br>
to the implementation of such strategies, well as to the large-scale setup of HSC "banks".<br>
Current strategies aimed at long-term maintenance/expansion of undifferentiated human HSC, have so far been met with limited success. While recent studies with cytokine-supplemented suspension cultures have shown some SRC expansion, this process was also accompanied by a massive increment of early hemopoietic progenitors (53, 62), indicating that a substantial degree of stem cell differentiation was taking place. An ideal system would be one, for example, in which SRC were expanded, while LTC-IC remain reduced in numbers.<br>
Current systems for hemopoietic cell expansion employ perfused suspension cultures of hemopoietic cells, alone (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,043) or seeded on stromal-cell monolayers (see, U.S. Pat No. 5,605,822). While the former system demonstrates a tremendous production of committed progenitors, the latter suffers from the non-physiological nature of monolayer stromal-stem cell interactions. Additional systems for stem cell expansion describe the use of stromal cell conditioned media (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,536,151 and 5,437,994), However, the latter were obtained from stromal cell monolayer cultures, which are clearly shown herein to be inferior and different in stem cell activating capacity, as compared to 3D SCM (see, Table 3 of the Examples section). Although a stationary phase bioreactor using stromal cell-coated glass beads has recently been described (U.S. Pat. No. 5,906,940), the beads do not provide a physiological, 3D structure and allow the propagation of a 10-fold lower number of stromal cells per ml, as compared to the carriers employed while reducing the present invention to practice. The advantage of a 3D versus monolayer stromal cell culture is clearly demonstrated by the findings presented herein of<br><br>
the superior capacity of 3D derived SCM or 3D stromal cell cultures to support the maintenance of CD34+38- cells (see. Figures 6 and 7). The superior effect of 3D SCM may be attributed to enhanced levels of known cytokines or novel stem cell regulators.<br>
Experiments aimed at evaluating the combined effects of 3D SCM and various cytokines (SCF, FLT3 ligand, TPO), on CD34+38-CXCR4+ (or SRC) maintenance/expansion (Table 3), clearly show a beneficial effect of 3D SCM in the presence of FLT3 ligand and TPO, but not SCF. These findings can be attributed to a relative inhibitory effect of 3D SCM on stem cell differentiation. These findings strongly indicate that under 3D conditions, novel stromal cell -associated factors which, perhaps less active themselves, may act synergistically with such cytokines, were produced. The use of LTC-IC and committed progenitor cell (GM-CFU) output readouts, in addition to CD34+ output, allow to test for stem cell differentiation.<br>
The bioreactor described herein is unique in that Jt combines both 3D stromal cell cultures with a continuous flow system. While 3D stromal-hemopoietic cell systems without continuous medium flow have recently been described (U.S. Pat. No, 5,541,107), the findings described herein (see, for example. Figure 7) clearly demonstrate the diminished advantage of 3D stromal cell cultures relative to monolayers, in the absence of continuous flow.<br>
The 3D plug-flow bioreactor described herein is capable of supporting the long-term growth of stromal cell lines, as well as primary marrow stromal cells. The use of stromal cells in the bioreactor is not only essential for the establishment of superior stromal-stem cell contact (via unique "niches" and cell-cell, cell-ECM interactions), but also for stromal cell production of known and novel soluble and membrane-<br><br>
bound cytokines. Stromal cells can facilitate the supplementation of such bioreactors with appropriate cytokines, by using genetically engineered cytokine-producing variants.<br>
Bioreactor stromal cells can also be engineered to serve as retroviral packaging cell lines, enabling the efficient transduction of genetic material into stem cells, within the bioreactor itself. The use of various stromal cells in the bioreactor can also allow the selection of the most suitable substrate for purging of Ph-positive stem cells, the latter known for their lesser capacity for stromal cell adherence (63). Primary stromal cells have the advantage that they enable the establishment of "autologous" stromal-stem cell bioreactors, on which autologous or even cord blood stem cells can be expanded and which eliminate the need to remove stromal cells prior to transplantation.<br>
While the initial seeding experiments in the bioreactor indicated a rather small yield of CD34+38- cells in the carrier, the medium flow rate following seeding, as well as initial CD34+ cell numbers seeded into the bioreactor can be readily optimized, CD34+38-CXCR4+ analysis at early time points (1-4 days) following seeding is essential for such optimization.<br>
In sharp distinction to prior art methods, the bioreactor of the present invention employs a growth matrix that substantially increases the available attachment surface for the adherence of the stromal cells so as to mimic the mechanical infrastructure of bone marrow. For example, for a growth matrix of 0.5 mm in height, the increase is by a factor of at least from 5 to 30 times, calculated by projection onto a base of the growth matrix. Such an increase by a factor of about 5 to 30 times, is per unit layer, and if a plurality of such layers, either stacked or separated by spacers or the like, is used, the factor of 5 to 30 times applies per each<br><br>
such structure. When the matrix is used in sheet form, preferably non-woven fiber sheets, or sheets of open-pore foamed polymers, the preferred thickness of the sheet is about 50 to 1000   or more, there being provided adequate porosity for cell entrance, entrance of nutrients and for removal of waste products from the sheet. According to a preferred embodiment the pores having an effective diameter of 10 ‘m to 100 |im. Such sheets can be prepared from fibers of various thick nesses, the preferred fiber thickness or fiber diameter range being from about 0,5 fim to 20   still more preferred fibers are in the range of 10 fim to 15 n m in diameter.<br>
The structures of the invention may be supported by, or even better bonded to, a porous support sheet or screen providing for dimensional stability and physical strength.<br>
Such matrix sheets may also be cut, punched, or shredded to provide particles with projected area of the order of about 0.2 mm’ to about 10 mm2, with the same order of thickness (about 50 to 1000 |im).<br>
Further details relating to the fabrication, use and/or advantages of the growth matrix which was used to reduce the present invention to practice are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,168,085, and in particular, 5,266,476, both are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
Bioreactor: The bioreactor used in accordance with the teachings of the present invention was constructed in accordance with the design described in Figure 1. The glassware was designed and manufactured at the Technion (Israel) and connected by silicone tubing (Detain, Israel). The carriers were rotated overnight in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Bait Hauberk Industries, Israel) without Ca"‘2 and Mg'"‘‘ followed by removal of the PBS and released debris. Each column was loaded with 10 ml packed carrier. The bioreactor was filled with PBS-Ca-Mg, all outlets were sealed and the system was autoclaved (120 ‘'C, 30 minutes). The PBS was removed via container [8] and the bioreactor was circulated<br><br>
in a ST’'C incubator with 300 ml Duibecco's high-glucose medium (DMEM; GIBCO BRL) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Beit Ha'Emek Industries, Israel) and a Pen-Strep-Nystatin mixture (100 U/ml:100 ‘g/ml:1.25 ‘n/mI; Beit Ha'Emek), for a period of 48 hours. Circulating medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing the above + 2 mM L-glutamine (Beit Ha'Emek).<br>
Stromal cells:   Stromal cell lines were maintained at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS, in a fully humidified incubator of 5 % CO2 in air. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks (Coming) and were split by trypsinization upon reaching confluence.   Primary human marrow stromal cultures were established from aspirated sterna marrow of hematological  healthy   donors   undergoing  open-heart   surgery. Briefly, marrow aspirates were diluted 3-fold in Hank's Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS;.GIBCO BRL) and were subject to FicoU-Hypaque (Robbins    Scientific    Corp,        Sunnyvale,    CA)    density    gradient centrifugation.     Marrow mononuclear cells  (
 <br>
Seeding of stromal cells: Confluent cultures of stromal cell lines or 5-week primary marrow stromal cells were trypsinized and the cells washed 3 times in HBSS, resuspended in bioreactor medium (see above), counted and seeded at 10’ cells/ml in 10 ml volumes via an injection point ([4], Figure I) onto 10 ml carriers in the glass column of the bioreactor. Immediately following seeding, circulation was stopped for 16 hours to allow the cells to settle on the carriers. Stromal cell growth in the bioreactor was monitored by removal of carriers and cell enumeration by the MTT method (56). When stromal cells were confluent, medium was replaced with LTC medium, for continued studies (preparation of SCM, stem cell seeding).<br>
Preparation of stromal cell conditioned medium (SCM): At equivalent cell densities, monolayer and bioreactor stromal cells were recharged with fresh LTC culture medium. SCM was collected following overnight incubation of the cells. For this purpose, medium flow in the 3D cultures was stopped for 16 hours and .removed directly from the column prior to re-initiation of circulation. For analysis of the effect of CD34+ cells on stromal cell production of SRC, circulation was stopped at various intervals (2-7 days) after seeding of CD34+ into the 3D system and medium collected from the column as described above. SCM was spun (1000 x g, 10 minutes), filtered and stored at -20 '‘C. Stromal cells were also grown in the bioreactor in serum-free medium, for the collection of SCM, thereby excluding undefined variables.<br>
Isolation of CD34+ cells: Umbilical cord blood samples taken under sterile conditions during delivery were fractionated on FicoU-Hypaque and buoyant (
 <br>
Suspension cultures of CD34’ cells: CB CD34+ cells (SxlO’/well) were incubated in 24-well dishes (TPP, Switzerland), in 0.5 ml of 0-100 % SCM, minus or plus 300 ng/mi each of FLT3 ligand, SCF, or TPO, alone or combined. Controls contained LTC medium plus or minus cytokines. Cells were incubated at 37 "‘C at 5 % CO2 in air. Culture medium was exchanged weekly. Prior to seeding and at various times (1-3 weeks), cells were harvested, enumerated and assayed for CD34+/38-/CXCR4+ by flow cytometry. Output assays can also include SRC, CAFC and LTC-IC.<br>
Stromal-stent cell cocultures:  Isolated, pooled CB CD34-f cells were seeded at equivalent numbers (about 5 x 10’) onto monolayer or bioreactor containing equivalent densities of confluent stromal cells. Upon addition to the bioreactor, medium flow was stopped for 16 hours to enable contact with stromal cells and was re-initiated at a rate of 0.1 -1,0 ml per minute.     CD34+ cell seeded-stroma cell carriers were removed  for control  studies  in the  absence of medium exchange. Cocultures were maintained in LTC medium, with or without cytokines. At various times (up to 4 weeks), no adherent cells were collected from monolayer supematants  or from  circulating culture  medium via  a container ([8], Figure 1).   Adherent cells were collected via sequential trypsinization and exposure to EDTA-based dissociation buffer (GIBCO BRL), followed by gentle pupating of the cells. To avoid the presence of stromal cells in the resulting suspension, the cells were resuspended in HBSS +  10 % FCS and were subjected to a 60 minutes adhesion procedure in plastic tissue culture dishes (Coming), at 37 °C. Circulating and carrier-isolated hemopoietic cells were washed, counted and assayed separately for CD34+/38-/CXCR4+ by flow cytometry.   Output assays can also include SRC, CAFC and LTC-IC.<br><br>
Flow Cytometry: Cells were incubated at 4'C for 30 minutes with saturating concentrations of monoclonal anti-CD34+PerCP (Beckton-Dickinson), anti-CXCR4-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, R&amp;D systems) and - phycoerythrin (PE, Beckton-Dickinson) antibodies. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS containing 5 % heat-inactivated FCS and resuspended for three-color flow cytometry on a FACSscan (Beckton-Dickinson).<br>
LTC'IC and CAFC assays:  Freshly isolated CD34+ cells, cells isolated from stromal-stem cell cocultures or from suspension cultures, were assayed for LTC-IC and CAFC, as previously described (16, 17). Confluent primary marrow stromal cells were trypsinized, irradiated (1500 cGy)  and  plated  in 0.1  ml  in 96-well  dishes  (Coming)  at I.SxlO’/well.   24 replicate wells/group were established.   Stromal cells were overlaid with 0.1 ml of LTC medium containing serial dilutions of CD34+ cells (500-5 cells/well), or with serial dilutions of cells harvested from various assays.   Cultures were directly incubated at 33 °C for 5 weeks, with weekly half-medium exchange.  Plates were spun down at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes, culture supematants removed and remaining cells overplayed with methylcellulose cultures and cytokines for myeloid progenitor cell assays, as previously described (57),    Colonies were enumerated  following  14  days and LTC-IC  frequency  determined according to the reciprocal of the concentration of test cells that gives 37 % negative cultures (16).  The CAFC assay was basically performed as above except for the absence of overlay of methylcellulose and cytokines. The percentage of wells with at least one phase-dark hemopoietic clone of at least five cells (cobblestone area) beneath the stromal layer was determined at week 6 following seeding of the test cell suspensions, in serial dilutions.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<br>
The bioreactor system employed while reducing the present invention to practice is depicted in Figure 1, It contained four parallel plug flow bioreactor units [5], Each bioreactor unit contained 1 gram of corrosive carriers (4 mm in diameter) made of a non woven fabric matrix of polyester (58). These carriers enable the propagation of large cell numbers in a relatively small volume. The structure and packing of the carrier have a major impact on oxygen and nutrient transfer, as well as on local concentrations and released stromal cell products (e.g., ECM proteins, cytokines, 59). The bioreactor was maintained in an incubator of37’C.<br>
The flow in each bioreactor was monitored [6] and regulated by a valve [6a]. Each bioreactor contains a sampling and injection point [4], allowing the sequential seeding of stromal and hemopoietic cells. Culture medium was supplied at pH 7.0 [13] from a reservoir [1]. The reservoir was supplied by a filtered [3] gas mixture containing air/C02/02 [2] at differing proportions in order to maintain 5-40 % dissolved oxygen at exit from the column, depending on cell density in the bioreactor. The O2 proportion was suited to the level of dissolved O2 at the bioreactor exit, as was determined by a monitor [12], The gas mixture was supplied to the reservoir via silicone tubes. The culture medium was passed through a separating container [7] which enabled collection of circulating, no adherent cells. Circulation of the medium was obtained by means of a peristaltic pump [9] operating at a rate of 0.1-3 ml/minute. The bioreactor units were equipped with an additional sampling point [10] and two containers [8, 11] for continuous medium exchange at a rate of 10-50 ml/day. The use of four parallel bioreactor<br><br>
units enables periodic dismantling for purposes such as cell removal, scanning electron microscopy, histology, immunohistochemist , RNA extraction, etc.<br>
In one experiment a bioreactor system containing the murine 14FL1 stromal cell line (24, 60, 61), which was previously shown to support the growth of committed human myeloid progenitors (24) has been established. This cell line can also equally support human CB CAFC (Figure 2), LTC-IC (Figure 3) and CD34+38- cells (Figure 4), as well as primary human marrow stromal cells. The results presented in these Figures also show that the addition of FLT3 ligand + TPO to these cultures has no effect on LTC-IC, whereas these cytokines significantly enhanced CAFC and CD34+38- cell output. In contrast, SCF induced a decline in both LTC-IC and CAFC. When seeded into the bioreactor at 1.5x10’ cells/10 ml culture volume, 14F1.1 cells grew and spread on the carriers (Figure 5). By day 40 following seeding, the carriers contained a 100-fold increased cell density, i.e., approximately 1,5x10’ cells/carrier, L5xl07 cells/ml (Table 1).<br><br>
The cellular density on carriers at various levels of the column was the same, indicating a homogenous transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the cells. The culture conditions were optimized for these cells: culture medium (Dulbecco's high-glucose medium + 10 % fetal calf serum), flow rate (1 ml/min), medium exchange frequency (once a week), initial seeding density (as above). No beneficial effect was found for collagen or poly L-Insane carrier coating, on the growth rate and final density of 14F1.1 cells. Preliminary findings with primary human marrow stromal cells (Table 1) indicated a similar density of 14FL1 and primary stromal cells, on days 10 and 14 following seeding, respectively.<br>
In order to assay the functional activity of the stromal cells within the bioreactor, the effect of stromal cells conditioned medium (SCM) obtained from the bioreactor column (3D SCM), on the expansion of CD34+38- cells in suspension cultures seeded with human CB CD34+ cells was determined. The activity was compared to SCM obtained from monolayer cultures (2D SCM) containing the same concentration of stromal cells. As shown in Figure 6, SCM from 14FL1 cells was found to be equally or more capable of supporting the maintenance of human CB CD34+38- cells, than SCM from primary marrow stromal cells. A maximal effect of 14F1.1 SCM was consistently observed at a lower concentration than that of primary marrow SCM. Furthermore, 3D SCM was found to be superior to 2D SCM of both cell types, in supporting the expansion of human CB CD34+38- cells. The difference in activity between 2D and 3D SCM was more pronounced with culture duration (14 versus 21 days). The addition of 14F1.1 3D SCM to suspension cultures of human CB CD34+ cells also resulted in the maintenance of CD34+38-CXCR4+ cells (Table 2), as compared to control cultures containing medium alone.<br><br><br><br>
presence of 2D SCM but enhanced their yield in cultures supplemented with 3D SCM. Again, this can be attributed to the lesser extent of differentiation in the 3D system, as determined by the CD34+ surface marker. In both 2D and 3D SCM cultures, SCF induced a marked increase in stem cell differentiation and a marked decline in the yield of CD34+38./ CD34+38-CXCR4+ cells.<br>
In order to assay stromal-stem cell interactions in our bioreactor, the maintenance/expansion of CD34+38- cells on stromal cell (14F1.1)-coated carriers was first evaluated. The latter were removed from the bioreactor into silicone-coated 96-well dishes, followed by the addition of CD34+ cells. Controls contained carriers alone and carrier-equivalent numbers of monolayer 14F1.1 cells. As shown in Figure 7, the survival of CD34+38- cells was enhanced by the presence of the carrier alone, confirming the beneficial effect of a 3D structure on the survival/maintenance of primitive progenitors (36). Stromal-cell coated carriers were superior to carriers alone or to monolayer'14F 1.1 cells, in promoting the 7-day survival/maintenance of CD34+38- cells. Prolonged culture (day 14) resulted in increased CD34+38- numbers in both 14F1.1 monolayer and 14F 1.1-coated carrier cultures.<br>
In a subsequent experiment 6x10’ pooled CB CD34+ (3x10’ CD34+38-) cells were seeded into a bioreactor containing 4 columns of non-irradiated, 14Fl.l-coated carriers, in 350 ml circulating culture medium. Medium flow was stopped for 16 hours and continued thereafter at a normal rate (1 ml/min). Following 4 days of co culture, circulating medium contained 10 % of the initially seeded CD34+38-cells, determined by FACS analysis of harvested viable cells. Following 18 days of culture, circulating medium contained 0.4 % CD34+38- cells,<br><br>
while carrier -adherent cells contained 3  % of the initially seeded CD34+38- population.<br>
