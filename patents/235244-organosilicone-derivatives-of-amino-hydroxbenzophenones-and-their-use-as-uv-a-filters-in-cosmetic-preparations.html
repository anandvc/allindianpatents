ORGANOSILICONE DERIVATIVES OF AMINO HYDROZYBENZOPHENONES AND THEIR USE AS UV-A FILTERS IN COSMETIC PREPARATIONS<br>
The present invention relates to organosilicone derivatives of amino hydroxybenzo-phenones, to a process for their preparation, compositions comprising these derivatives and the use thereof.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to organosilicone compounds comprising a unit of formula I<br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
b     is 0, 1, 2, 3; and<br>
R" is hydrogen, a saturated or unsaturated C1-C10hydrocarbon group or a trimethylsilyloxy<br>
group.<br>
Suitable organosilicone compounds are polymeric materials which maybe homopolymers consisting only of such units of formula I, or they may be copolymers containing both units having either the general formula I or II. The units of formula I maybe distributed randomly in an organosiloxane polymer, they may be the end blocking units of the polymer or they maybe located at the end of the polymer and pending in a chain of the polymer at the same time. The organosilicone compounds may vary from freely flowing liquids to highly viscous gum-like materials or resinous soiids.<br>
If a is 2 the two substitutents Rl may be identical or different. If b is 2 or 3 the two or three substituents R2 may be identical or different. If the polymer contains more than one unit of formula I the substituents Rl maybe identical or different from unit to unit. If the polymer contains more than one unit of formula II the substituents R~ maybe identical or different from unit to unit<br>
Examples for a saturated or unsaturated C1-C30hydrocarbon group include C1-C30alky! such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl; C2-C30alkenyl such as vinyl and allyl and unsub-stituted or substituted aryl such as phenyl, alkaryl and alkoxyphenyl. The hydrocarbon group is unsubstituted or substituted by, e.g. halogen, e.g. a halogenated C1-C18hydro-carbon group.<br><br><br>
Examples for cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl include cyclopropyl, 2-methyl-cycIopropyl, cyclobutyl, cydopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyciopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cydopentenyl, (3-methyl)-cyclopenta-2,4-dienyl and 11-cyclododecenyl.<br>
The terms "divalent C3-C12alkylene chain" and "divalent C3-C12alkenylene chain" mean linker groups, in particular linker groups which link the UV absorbing chromophoric residue to the silane, oligosiloxane or polysiloxane moiety. Examples for C3-C12alkylene include straight chain or branched saturated hydrocarbon residues such as 3-propylene, 2-propylene, 2-methyl-3-propylene, 3-butylene, 4-butylene, 4-pentylene, 5-pentyIene, 6-hexylene, and the like. Examples for CrCnalkenylene include unsaturated hydrocarbon residues containing at least one double bond, such as for example, 2-propen-2-ylene,<br>
2-propen-3-ylene, 3-buten-3-ylene, 3-buten-4-ylene, 4-penten-4-ylene, 4-penten-5-ylene,<br><br>
In the organosilicone compounds of the invention die following preferences apply independently, collectively or in any combination or sub-combination:<br>
(a)	organosilicone compounds wherein the number of units of formula I is limited to a<br>
maximum of 50%, more preferably of 10 to 40 %, most preferably 30 to 40% of the total<br>
number of siloxane units in the molecule; .<br>
(b)	liquid substantially linear organosiloxane homopolymers and copolymers, for example<br>
those having a viscosity from 50-20000 mVs;<br><br><br>
(d2) b is 2;<br>
(d3) R2 is methyl in 80 %, preferably 100 % of units of formula II.<br>
When a = land b = 2 the organosilicone compound is a substantially linear or cyclic di-organo-siloxane polymer. However, if the diorgar.osiloxane is a substantially linear polymer at least two endblocking units must be present, thus requiring either the presence of two units in which a has a value of 2 or two units in which b is 3.<br>
A preferred linear diorgano-siloxane polymer (hereinafter: COMPOUND) is a polymer comprising one structural unit of formula IVa and one structural unit of. formula IVb<br><br><br>
SiH derivatives are well known in the silicone industry and are commercially available. They are described, for example, in the following patents: US 3,220,972, US 3,697,474 and US 4,340,709.<br>
The hydrosilylation may be carried out by reacting the SiH derivative in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, e.g. platinum on charcoal or a platinum complex catalyst, such as e.g. di vinyl-tetramethyl disiloxane platinum complex with a compound of formula VII<br><br>
in which R3, R4 and X are as defined for formula III and Y' has the same definition as Y in formula III, but is terminated either with a double or a triple bond. The addition may proceed at both positions of the unsaturated carbon-carbon bond, leading to isomeric mixtures of organosilicone products e.g. containing exo and endo double bonds.<br>
The hydrosilylation maybe performed in a suitable reaction solvent, e.g. in isopropanol or toluene. The reactants may be present in about equal molar amounts. The reaction may be run at an elevated temperature, e.g. in a range of from 40°C to 150°C, preferably from 50°C to 100°C, e.g., at about 80°C.<br>
Compounds of formula VII are generally known and maybe prepared, e.g., according to the procedure described in EP 1,046,391 by acylation of the corresponding amino substituted phenols followed by reaction with the respective alcohol or amine such as propinol, allyl alcohol, vinyl alcohol, prop-2-ynyl amine or vinyl amine. Exemplary amino<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention have adsorption maxima in the UV-A region and are effective in absorbing ultra violet radiation in the UV-A range (320-400nm) which makes them particularly suitable for use in cosmetic sunscreen preparations where absorption in the UV-A range is particularly desirable.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to compositions comprising the novel organosilicone compounds, formulated into a suitable support or substrate. Typically, the compositions of the invention are adopted for protecting a material that is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, in particular solar radiation, such as skin and/ or hair and comprises an effective photoprotective amount of an organosilicone compound of the invention.<br>
For the preparation of light screening agents, especially of preparations for dermatological and/or cosmetic use, such as skin protection and sunscreen formulations for everyday cosmetics a compound of this invention may be incorporated in auxiliary agents, e.g. a cosmetic base, which are conventionally used for such formulations. Where convenient, other conventional UV-A and/or UV-B screening agents may also be added. The combination of UV filters may show a synergistic effect. The preparation of said light screening agents is well known to the skilled artisan in this field. The concentration of UV filters is not critical. For example, the amount of compounds of the present invention and optionally an additional hydrophilic and/or lipophilic UV-A or UV-B screening agent other than the compounds described in this invention maybe in the range of from 0.5 to 12% by weight of the total composition. These additional screening agents are advantageously selected from the compounds listed below without being limited thereto:<br>
Examples of UV B screening agents, i.e. substances having absorption maxima between about 290 and 320 nm, which come into consideration for combination with the compounds of the present invention are for example the following organic and inorganic com-<br><br><br>
anedioic acid diethyl ester as described in EP 895,776; organosiloxane compounds containing benzmaionate groups as described in EP 358,584, EP 538,431 and EP 709,080; biometrizole trisiloxane (MEXORYL XL); pigments such as microparticulated TiO2, and he like, wherein the term "microparticulated" refers to a particle size from about 5 nm to bout 200 nm, particularly from about 15 nm to about 100 nm, and which T1O2 particles nay be coated by metal oxides such as e.g. aluminum or zirconium oxides or by organic coatings such as e.g. polyols, methicone, aluminum stearate, alkyl silane; imidazole derivatives such as e.g. 2-phenyl benzimidazole sulfonic acid and its salts (PARSOL®HS). Salts of 2-phenyl benzimidazole sulfonic acid are e.g. alkali salts such as sodium- or potassium salts, ammonium salts, morpholine salts, salts of primary, sec. and tert amines like mono-thanolamine salts, diethanolamine salts and the like; salicylate derivatives such as iso-propylbenzyl salicylate, benzyl salicylate, butyl salicylate, octyl salicylate (NEO HELIOPAN DS), isooctyl salicylate or homomenthyl salicylate (homosalate, HELIOPAN) and the like; xiazine derivatives such as octyl triazone (UV1NULT-150), dioctyl butamido triazone UVASORB HEB), bis ethoxyphenoi methoxyphenyl triazine (TINOSORB S) and the like;  polysiloxane containing a UV-B chromophor like e.g. Polysilicone 15 (Dimethicodiethyl-benzalmalonate or Parsol SLX).<br>
Examples of UV A screening agents i.e. substances having absorption maxima between about 320 and 400 nm, which come into consideration for combination with the compounds of the present invention are for example the following organic and inorganic compounds: dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as 4-tert. butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoyl-methane (PARSOL® 1789), dimethoxydibenzoylmethane, isopropyldibenzoylmethane and<br><br>
"microparticulated" refers to a particle size from about 5 nm to about 200 nm, particularly from about 15 nm to about 100 nm, and which ZnO particles maybe coated by metal oxides such as e.g. aluminum or zirconium oxides or by organic coatings such as e.g. polyols, methicone, aluminum stearate, alkyl silane.<br>
As dibenzoylmethane derivatives have limited phostability it may be desirable to photo-stabilize these UV-A screening agents. Thus, the term "conventional UV-A screening agent" also refers to dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as e.g. PARSOL® 1789 stabilized<br><br>
by, e.g., 3,3-diphenylacrylate derivatives as described in EP 514,491 and EP 780,119; benzylidene camphor derivatives as described in US 5,605,680; organosiloxanes containing benzmatonate groups as described in EP 358,584, EP 538,431 and EP 709,080.<br>
