The compounds for which simultaneously R1 R2,<br>
R'2, R3, R4, R5, G, M, J, Y, K, Z, R6, R*7 and R8 are as<br>
defined in the first subgroup of compounds above form a<br>
second subgroup.<br>
Among the compounds of general formula (I)<br>
and the subgroups above, a third subgroup of compounds<br>
is composed of the compounds for which:<br>
R1 represents a C1-4 alkyl, preferably an isopropyl or a<br>
tert-butyl, or a phenyl substituted by two fluorine<br>
atoms; and/or<br>
R2 and R'2 represent independently of one another a<br>

In the context of the present invention:<br><br>
-	Ct-z , where t and z may take the values from 1 to 7,<br>
is understood to mean a carbon chain which can have<br>
from t to z carbon atoms, for example, C1-3, a carbon<br>
chain which can have from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, C3-6, a<br>
carbon chain which can have from 3 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
and so on;<br>
-	alkyl is understood to mean a linear or branched<br>
saturated aliphatic group: for example, a C1-6 alkyl<br>
group represents a linear or branched carbon chain of<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more particularly a methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-<br>

-	heteroaromatic group is understood to mean a cyclic<br>
aromatic group containing between 1 and 10 carbon atoms<br>
and between 1 and 4 heteroatoms, such as nitrogen,<br>

tetrazolyl and benzoxazolyl groups, etc.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may<br>
include one or more asymmetric carbons. They may<br>
therefore exist in the form of enantiomers or diastereo-<br>
isomers. These enantiomers and diastereoisomers, and<br>
their mixtures, including the racemic mixtures, form<br>
part of the invention. When the carbon carrying R2 and<br>
R'2 and/or the carbon carrying R3 are asymmetric,<br><br>
preference is given to the compounds of general formula<br>
(I) for which the carbon carrying R2 and R'2 is of (S)<br>
configuration and/or the carbon carrying R3 is of (S)<br>
configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in the form of<br>
bases or of addition salts with acids. Such addition<br>
salts form part of the invention.<br>
These salts are advantageously prepared with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids, although the salts<br>
of other acids useful, for example, for the purification<br>
or isolation of compounds of formula (I) also form part<br>
of the invention.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may<br>
occur in the form of hydrates or solvates, in other<br>
words in the form of associations or combinations with<br>
one or more molecules of water or with a solvent. Such<br>
hydrates and solvates likewise form part of the<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention secondly provides processes for<br>
preparing the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Thus these compounds may be prepared by<br>
processes, illustrated in the schemes below, whose<br>
operating conditions are conventional for the person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
A protective group is understood to mean a group which<br>
makes it possible to block the reactivity of a<br>
functional group or position in the course of a<br>
chemical reaction which might affect it, and which<br><br>
restores the molecule after cleavage according to<br>
methods known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Examples of protective groups and of methods of<br>
protection and deprotection are given, inter alia, in<br>
Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene et al.,<br>
2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
The meanings of R1 R2, R'2/ R3, R4/ R5/ G, M, J, Y, K,<br>
Z, R6, R*7 and R8 in the compounds of formula (II) to<br>
(XXI) below are as defined for the compounds of formula<br>
(I), unless any other definition is specified.<br>
According to Scheme 1 below, the compound of<br>
formula (I) may be obtained by peptide coupling of the<br>
2-aminothiazole of formula (III) with the acylamino<br>
acid of formula (II) according to conditions which are<br>
known to the person skilled in the art: for example, in<br>
the presence of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(pyrrolidino)-<br>
phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) or of benzo-<br>
triazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexa-<br>
fluorophosphate (BOP) and of N-ethylmorpholine or<br>
N-methylmorpholine in an inert solvent such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or dichloromethane<br>
at a temperature which may range from 0°C to the<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
The compound of formula (II) may be obtained by peptide<br>
coupling of the compound of formula (IV) with the<br>
protected acid of formula (V), in which Pg represents a<br>
protective group, for example a benzyl, according to<br><br>
methods which are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, as described above.<br>
The compound thus obtained is subsequently deprotected.<br>
Where the protection is a benzyl the compound is<br>
hydrogenated beforehand in the presence of palladium on<br>
carbon in absolute ethanol at atmospheric hydrogen<br>
pressure, at ambient temperature, to give the compound<br>
of formula (II).<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula (I)<br>
may be prepared according to Scheme 2 below.<br>
According to Scheme 2 the compound of formula<br>
(I) may be obtained by peptide coupling of the compound<br>
of formula (IV) with the amine of formula (VI),<br>
according to methods which are known to the person<br>
skilled in the art, such as, for example, in the<br>
presence of hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBt) and of<br>
l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydro-<br>
chloride (EDAC HC1).<br><br>
The compound of formula (VI) may be obtained<br>
by peptide coupling of the 2-aminothiazole of formula<br>
(III) with the protected amine of formula (VII), in<br><br>
which Pg represents a protective group, for example an<br>
N-tert-butoxycarbony1 (Boc), according to methods which<br>
are known to the person skilled in the art, as<br>
described above. The compound thus obtained is<br>
subsequently deprotected. Where the protection is a Boc<br>
the deprotection is accomplished by acidic hydrolysis<br>
in the presence of gaseous hydrochloric acid in<br>
solution in an anhydrous solvent or of trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, to give the compound of formula (VI).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in which R2 and R'2 form an<br>
oxo group may be obtained by oxidizing a hydroxyl of<br>
the compound of formula (I) in which R2 or R'2<br>
represents a hydroxyl group. The reaction may be<br>
carried out according to the conditions which are known<br>
to the person skilled in the art, for example with the<br>
Dess Martin reagent. These compounds may also be<br>
obtained by direct coupling of a keto acid of formula<br>
(IV), in which R2 and R'2 together form an oxo group,<br>
with an amine of formula (VI) according to the<br>
conditions which are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art. The methods of preparing such keto acids are known<br>
to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) in which R4 or<br>
R5 = Z, where Z represents a CN group or a group of<br>
heteroaromatic type, may be prepared in accordance with<br>
Schemes 3 to 6 below.<br>
The compounds of general formula (IIIa) and<br>
(IIIb), i.e. the compounds of general formula (III) in<br><br>
which R4 or R5 represents an oxadiazole group, may be<br>
obtained according to the methods illustrated by-<br>
Schemes 3 and 4 below.<br><br>
According to Scheme 3 above, the compound of<br>
formula (IIIa) may be obtained by reacting the compound<br>
of formula (VIII) , in which R represents a C1-6 alkoxy<br>
group and Pg represents a protective group such as a<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc), with an amide oxime of<br>
formula H2NC(=NOH)R8 in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at<br>
reflux in the presence of sodium hydride and of 4A<br>
molecular sieve in powder form. The compound thus<br>
obtained is subsequently deprotected according to the<br>
conditions which are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
According to Scheme 4 below, the compound of<br>
formula (X) is obtained by peptide coupling of the<br>
compound of formula (IX), in which Pg represents a<br>
protective group such as a Boc, with ammonia, in the<br><br>
presence for example of HOBt and of EDAC HCl. The<br>
compound of formula (X) may subsequently be reacted<br>
with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) in the presence<br>
of a base, for example triethylamine, to give the<br>
compound of formula (XI).<br><br>
The compound of formula (XII) may be obtained<br>
by addition of hydroxylamine HCl to the compound of<br>
formula (XI) in the presence of a base, for example<br>
sodium methoxide, according to an adaptation of the<br>
process described by Moloney et al. (J. Chem. Soc.<br><br>
Perkin Trans I, 1999, p. 2725). The compound of formula<br>
(XII) may subsequently be cyclized in the presence of a<br>
base such as sodium hydride and of an ester of formula<br>
R8CO2CH3 or R8CO2C2H5. The compound thus obtained is<br>
deprotected according to the conditions which are known<br>
to the person skilled in the art, to give the compound<br>
of general formula (IIIb).<br>
The method of preparation described in<br>
Scheme 4 may also make it possible to prepare the<br>
compounds of general formula (IIIc), i.e. the compounds<br>
of general formula (III) in which R4 or R5 represents a<br>
-CN group, by deprotecting the compounds of formula<br>
(XI) according to the conditions which are known to the<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of general formula (IIId), i.e.<br>
the compounds of general formula (III) in which R4 or R5<br>
represents a benzoxazole group, may be obtained<br>
according to the method illustrated by Scheme 5 below.<br><br><br>
According to Scheme 5 the compound of formula<br>
(IIId) may be obtained by a peptide coupling of the<br>
compound of formula (IX) as defined above and of a<br>
compound of formula (XIII), according to the conditions<br>
which are known to the person skilled in the art, for<br>
example in the presence of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris-<br>
(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) or<br>
of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and of N-ethylmorpholine or<br><br>
N-methylmorpholine in an inert solvent such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature which may range<br>
from 0°C to the ambient temperature.<br>
The compounds thus obtained may subsequently be<br>
cyclized by a Mitsunobu reaction according to an<br>
adaptation of the process described by Wang et al.<br>
(Tetrahedron Letters, 1997, p. 6529) and then<br>
deprotected by the methods which are known to the<br>
person skilled in the art, to give the compound of<br>
general formula (IIId).<br><br><br>
The compounds of general formula (IIIe), i.e.<br>
the compounds of general formula (III) in which R4 or R5<br><br>
represents a tetrazole group, may be obtained according<br>
to the method illustrated by Scheme 6 above.<br>
According to Scheme 6 the compound of formula (XIV) may<br>
be obtained by peptide coupling of the compound of<br>
formula (IX) as defined above and of a primary amine of<br>

known to the person skilled in the art, for example in<br>
the presence of HOBt and EDAC HC1. The compound (XIV)<br>
thus obtained is subjected to a Mitsunobu reaction<br>

The compounds of general formula (III) in<br>
which R4 or Rs represents an oxazole group may be<br>
obtained starting from the corresponding aldehyde,<br>
which is itself prepared starting from the ester of<br>
formula (VIII), according to procedures which are known<br>

p-toluenesulphonylmethyl isocyanate in the presence of<br>
a base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium<br>
methoxide, according to an adaptation of the method<br><br>
described by van Leusen et al. (Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
1972, p. 2369).<br>
The compound of formula (VIII), as defined<br>
above, may be obtained by protecting a compound of<br>
formula (IIIo),<br><br>
for example, when Pg represents a Boc group, by the<br>
action of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in anhydrous<br>
tetrahydrofuran in the presence of dimethylaminopyridine<br>
at ambient temperature.<br>
The compound of formula (IX), as defined above, may be<br>
obtained by hydrolysing the ester function of the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (VIII) according to<br>
conditions which are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, for example with lithium hydroxide in a 7:3 (v/v)<br>
tetrahydrofuran/water mixture at a temperature of 60°C.<br>
The compounds of formula (IIIo) may be<br>
prepared according to the methods which are illustrated<br>
by Schemes 7 and 8 below.<br>
The compound of formula (IIIo) in which R4 = -C(O)R, R<br>
representing a C1-6 alkoxy group, may be obtained<br>
according to Scheme 7 below.<br><br><br>

Cl2CHCOR, in which R represents a C1-6 alkoxy, and, for<br>
example, sodium methoxide or ethoxide at 0°C according<br>
to an adaptation of the process described by Takeda<br>
(Bull. Chem. Soc. JP, 1970, p. 2997). The mixture of<br>
products (XVI) and (XVII) obtained is treated with<br>
thiourea in the presence for example of methanol or<br>
ethanol at reflux for 4 or 8 hours to give the compound<br>
of formula (IIIo).<br>
The compound of formula (IIIo) in which R5 = -C(O)R, R<br>
representing a C1-6 alkoxy group, may be obtained<br>
according to Scheme 8.<br><br><br>
According to Scheme 8 the compound of formula<br>
(IIIo) may be obtained by brominating a p-keto ester of<br>
formula (XX) , in which R represents a C1-6 alkoxy,<br>
followed by a reaction with thiourea on the compound<br>
(XXI) thus obtained, according to an adaptation of the<br>
process described by A. Barton et al. (J.C.S. Perkin I,<br>
1982, p. 159).<br>
The β-keto ester of formula (XX) may be obtained by<br>
reacting a ketone of formula (XVIII) with a dialkyl<br>
carbonate of formula CO(R)2 in which R represents a C1-6<br>
alkoxy group, according to an adaptation of the process<br>
described by L. Crombie et al. (J.C.S. Perkin Trans. I,<br>
1987, p. 323) . The p-keto ester of formula (XX) may<br>
also be obtained by reacting an acid of formula (XIX),<br>
activated with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) with a<br>
malonate of formula RCOCH2CO2K, in which R represents a<br>
C1-6 alkoxy, according to an adaptation of the process<br>
described for example by D.W. Brooks et al. (Angew.<br>
Chem. Int. Ed., 1979, p. 72).<br>
Where R4 represents a hydrogen atom the preparation of<br>
the compound of formula (XX) is accomplished according<br>
to an adaptation of the process described for example<br>
by R. Zhao et al. in Tetrahedron Letters, 2001,<br>
p. 2101.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) in which R4 or<br>
R5 = Z, where Z represents a group S02NRsR*7, may be<br>
prepared starting from the corresponding sulphonyl<br><br>
chlorides, which are available commercially, or<br>
starting from compounds described in the literature<br>
(for example by R.P. Fatheree et al. in WO 99/26932A1,<br>
by I.T. Barnish et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1980, p. 117<br>
and by R. Fischer et al. in WO 01/047904A1), or may be<br>
prepared by methods which are described therein or<br>
which are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In Schemes 1 to 8 the starting compounds and<br>
the reagents, especially the compounds of formula<br>
(III), (IV), (V), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (XIII), (XV),<br>
(XVIII), (XIX), CO(R)2, RC (O) CH2CO2K, C12CHCOR, R8NH2,<br>
R8CO2CH3, R8CO2C2H5 and H2NC (=N0H) R8/ when the method of<br>
preparing them is not described, are available<br>
commercially or are described in the literature, or may<br>
be prepared by methods which are described therein or<br>
which are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
For example, the compounds of formula (IV) where R2 or<br>
R'2 represents a hydroxyl may be prepared by addition of<br>
trimethylsilyl cyanide to an aldehyde according to an<br>
adaptation of the process described by D.A. Evans et<br>
al. (J.C.S., Chem. Comm. 1973, p. 55) or by the action<br>
of sodium nitrite on an alpha-amino acid according to<br>
an adaptation of the process described by I. Shinn et<br>
al. (J. Org. Chem., 2000, p. 7667).<br>
For example, the amide oxime of the formula H2NC(=NOH)R8<br>
may be obtained according to processes which are known<br>
to the person skilled in the art, for example according<br><br>
to the method described by Moloney et al. in J. Chem.<br>
Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1999, p. 2725.<br>
When a functional group of a compound is<br>
reactive, for example when R1 comprises a hydroxyl, it<br>
may necessitate prior protection before reaction. The<br>
person skilled in the art will be able readily to<br>
determine the necessity of a prior protection.<br>

The table which follows illustrates the<br>
chemical structures and physical properties of some<br>
examples of compounds according to the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the table:<br>
-	(S) or (R) in the columns "R3" and "R2, R'2"<br>
indicates the stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbon<br>
carrying R3 or R2 in the formula (I) . For the carbon<br>
carrying R2 the indication (S) or (R) does not relate to<br>
the case where R2 and R'2 together form an oxo group;<br>
-	MH+ is the value of the mass of the compound<br>
protonated by a hydrogen atom (mass of the compound +<br>
1), as determined by LC-MS.<br>
The compounds of the invention were subjected<br>
to pharmacological tests, which showed their advantage<br>
as active substances in therapy.<br>
They were tested in particular for their<br>
inhibitory effects on the production of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide (β-A4).<br>
β-Amyloid peptide (β-A4) is a fragment of a<br>
larger precursor protein called APP (amyloid precursor<br>
protein). The latter is produced and is present in<br>
various cells of human or animal tissue. However its<br>
cleavage in cerebral tissue by protease-type enzymes<br>
leads to the formation of the β-A4 peptide, which<br>
accumulates in the form of an amyloid plaque. The two<br>
proteases responsible for producing the amyloid peptide<br>
are known by the name of beta- and gamma-secretases<br>
(Wolfe MS, Secretase targets for Alzheimer's disease:<br>
identification and therapeutic potential, J. Med. Chem.<br>
2001, 44 (13): 2039-60).<br><br>
It has been demonstrated that this gradual<br>
deposition of the β-A4 peptide is neurotoxic and might<br>
play an important role in Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Accordingly the compounds of the present<br>
invention, as an inhibitor of the production of the<br>
p-amyloid peptide (β-A4) by inhibition of gamma-<br>
secretase, can be used in the treatment of pathologies<br>
such as senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Down's<br>
syndrome, Parkinson's disease, amyloid angiopathy<br>
and/or cerebrovascular disorders, frontotemporal<br>
dementias and Pick's disease, post-traumatic dementias,<br>
pathologies linked to neuroinflammatory processes,<br>
Huntington's disease and Korsakov's syndrome.<br>
The tests were conducted in accordance with<br>
the protocol described below.<br>
For the β-amyloid cellular test, the CHO-K1<br>
line coexpres3ing the CT100 of APP and PS1 M146L clone<br>
3O-12 is used. The line targets the inhibition of<br>
gamma-secretase. Presenilin is linked to gamma-<br>
secretase activity (Wolfe MS, Haass C, The Role of<br>
presenilins in gamma-secretase activity, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
2001, 276(8): 5413-6) and its coexpression with the<br>
amyloid protein or its N-terminal fragment causes an<br>
increase in secretion of the peptide Al-42 (β-A4),<br>
thereby generating a pharmacological tool which allows<br>
inhibition by the compounds of formula (I) of the<br>
production of the β-A4 peptide to be evaluated. 96-well<br>
culture plates are inoculated with 1x105 cells per well<br><br>
in 150 µl of incubation medium. The presence of a<br>
minimum percentage (1.3% final) of serum allows<br>
cellular adhesion to the plastic after 2-3 hours of<br>
incubation at 37°C, in the presence of 5% CO2. The<br>
products (15 µl) are tested at 10 µM DMSO 1% final and<br>
are incubated for 24-25 h at 37°C in the presence of 5%<br>
CO2 and 100% humidity. After this 24-25 h incubation,<br>
the cellular supernatants (100 µl) are transferred to<br>
ELISA plates, treated with the capture antibody 6E10<br>
(6E10, epitope: aal-17, INTERCHIM/SENETEK 320/10), to<br>
determine the amount of amyloid peptides secreted by<br>
the cells in the presence of compounds according to the<br>
invention. A series of synthetic control peptide,<br>
"peptide 1-40", at 5 and 10 ng/ml is treated in<br>
parallel. The ELISA plates are incubated overnight at<br>
4°C.<br>
The quantity of bound peptide is detected<br>
indirectly in the presence of a competitor which<br>
corresponds to the truncated peptide, peptide 1-28<br>
coupled to biotin, which is then detected with<br>
streptavidin coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The<br>
substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP FAST<br>
p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate, Sigma N2770), gives a yellow,<br>
soluble reaction product which can be read at 405 nm.<br>
The reaction is stopped with 0.1 M EDTA solution. For<br>
this purpose, following binding of the amyloid peptide<br>
in the ELISA plate, 50 µl of biotinylated peptide 1-28<br>
are added to 100 µl of cellular supernatant and<br><br>
incubated for 3 0 minutes at ambient temperature. The<br>
ELISA plates are then washed 3 times. After drying by-<br>
inversion on absorbent paper, 100 µl of streptavidin-<br>
alkaline phosphatase (Interchim/Jackson ImmunoResearch<br>
Laboratories 016-05O-084) are added per well and<br>
incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature. The plates<br>
are washed again and then the alkaline phosphatase<br>
substrate (pNPP 1 mg/ml) is added in an amount of<br>
100 µl per well. After 30 minutes of incubation at<br>
ambient temperature the reaction is stopped by adding<br>
100 µl per well of 0.1 M EDTA and reading is carried<br>
out at 405 nm.	<br>
The most active compounds of formula (I) <br>
according to the present invention showed an EC50 (50% <br>
effective concentration) of less than 500 nM, more <br>
 particularly less than 100 nM.<br>
Table 2 below gives the EC50 values of several<br>
compounds according to the invention.<br><br>
The results of biological tests show that the<br>
compounds are inhibitors of the formation of the<br>
(β-amyloid peptide (β-A4) .<br><br>
Accordingly these compounds can be employed<br>
in the treatment of pathologies in which a β-amyloid<br>
peptide (p-A4) formation inhibitor provides a<br>
therapeutic benefit. Particular such pathologies are<br>
senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome,<br>
Parkinson's disease, amyloid angiopathy,<br>
cerebrovascular disorders, frontotemporal dementias and<br>
Pick's disease, post-traumatic dementias, pathologies<br>
linked to neuroinflammatory processes, Huntington's<br>
disease and Korsakov's syndrome.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the<br>
invention for preparing a medicinal product intended<br>
for treating the abovementioned pathologies forms an<br>
integral part of the invention.<br>
The invention further provides medicinal<br>
products which comprise a compound of formula (I), or<br>
an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid or else a hydrate or a solvate of the<br>
compound of formula (I). These medicinal products find<br>
their use in therapy, in particular in the treatment of<br>
the abovementioned pathologies.<br>
In another of its aspects the present<br>
invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising as active principle at least one compound<br>
according to the invention. These pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprise an effective dose of a compound<br>
according to the invention, or of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the said<br><br>
compound, and, optionally, one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients.<br>
The said excipients are selected, according to the<br>
pharmaceutical form and the desired mode of<br>
administration, from the customary excipients which are<br>

In the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local,<br>
intratracheal, intranasal, transdermal or rectal<br>
administration, the active principle of formula (I)<br>

appropriate, can be administered in unit form for<br>
administration, as a mixture with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical excipients, to animals and to humans for<br>
the prophylaxis or treatment of the above diseases or<br>
disorders.<br>
The appropriate unit forms for administration<br>
embrace the forms for oral administration such as<br>
tablets, soft or hard gelatin capsules, powders,<br>
granules, chewing gums and oral solutions or<br>
suspensions, the forms for sublingual, buccal,<br>

or for administration by inhalation, the forms for<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous<br>
administration and the forms for rectal or vaginal<br>
administration. For topical application the compounds<br><br>

vary between 0.1 mg and 200 mg per kg of body weight<br>
per day. Although these dosages are average-situation<br>
examples, there may be particular cases in which higher<br>
or lower dosages are appropriate: such dosages are<br>
likewise part of the invention. In accordance with<br>
customary practice, the dosage appropriate to each<br>
patient is determined by the doctor in accordance with<br>
the mode of administration, the weight and the response<br>
of the said patient.<br>
Each unit dose can contain from 0.1 to<br>
1000 mg, preferably from 0.1 to 500 mg, of active<br>
