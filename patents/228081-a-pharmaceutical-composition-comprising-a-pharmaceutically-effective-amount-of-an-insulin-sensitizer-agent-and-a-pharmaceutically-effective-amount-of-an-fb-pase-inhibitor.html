This application is a continuation-in-part of Provisional Application Serial No. 60/114,718, filed December 23, 1998 and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A combination therapy of an insulin sensitizer and an FBPase inhibitor is disclosed for the treatment of diabetes, and other diseases where the control.of blood glucose levels or an improvement in insulin sensitivity, reduction in insulin levels or an enhancement of insulin secretion is beneficial. Compositions used in the therapy are also disclosed.<br>
Backeround of the Invention<br>
Diabetes mellitus (or diabetes) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world today. Diabetes patients have been divided into two classes, namely type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetics and is estimated to affect 12-14 million adults in the U. S. alone (6.6% of the population). NIDDM is characterized by both fasting hyperglycemia and exaggerated postprandial increases in plasma glucose levels. NIDDM is associated with a variety of long-term complications, including microvascular diseases such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models demonstrate a causal relationship between long term-hyperglycemia and complications. Results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Stockholm Prospective Study demonstrate this relationship for the first time in man by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics with tighter glycemic control are at substantially lower risk for the development and progression of these complications. Tighter control is also expected to benefit NIDDM patients.<br>
Current therapies used to treat NIDDM patients entail both controlling lifestyle risk factors and pharmaceutical intervention. First-line therapy for NIDDM is typically a<br><br>
tightly-controlled regimen of diet and exercise since an overwhelming number of NIDDM patients are overweight or obese (67%) and since weight loss can improve insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and lead to normoglycemia. Normalization of blood glucose occurs in less than 30% of these patients due to poor compliance and poor response. Patients with hyperglycemia not controlled by diet alone are subsequently treated with oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Until recently, the sulfonylureas were the only class of oral hypoglycemic agents available for NIDDM. Treatment with sulfonylureas leads to effective blood glucose lowering in only 70% of patients and only 40% after 10 years of therapy. Patients that fail to respond to diet and sulfonylureas are subsequently treated with daily insulin injections to gain adequate glycemic control.<br>
Although the sulfonylureas represent a major therapy for NIDDM patients, four factors limit their overall success. First, as mentioned above, a large segment of the NIDDM population do not respond adequately to sulfonylurea therapy (i.e. primary failures) or become resistant (i.e. secondary failures). This is particularly true in NIDDM patients with advanced NIDDM since these patients have severely impaired insulin secretion. Second, sulfonylurea therapy is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Third, chronic hyperinsulinemia has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease although this relationship is considered controversial and unproven. Last, sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, which leads to worsening of peripheral insulin sensitivity and thereby can accelerate the progression of the disease.<br>
Results from the U.K. Diabetes Prospective Study also showed that patients undergoing maximal therapy of a sulfonylurea, metformin, or a combination of the two, were unable to maintain normal fasting glycemia over the six year period of the study. U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study 16. Diabetes. 44:1249-158 (1995). These results further illustrate the great need for alternative therapies.<br>
Another drug therapy recently developed for NIDDM patients acts on the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance and thereby lower glucose by enhancing insulin action at both peripheral and hepatic sites. Saltiel &amp; Olefsky Diabetes 45: 1661-1669 (1996). Accordingly, these agents are reported to increase insulin-dependent glucose disposal and to inhibit HGO. These agents are commonly referred to as "insulin sensitizers".<br>
One class of insulin sensitizers are compounds containing a thiazolidinedione. These compounds are reported to enhance insulin action without directly stimulating<br><br>
insulin secretion. Thiazoiidinediones markedly decrease glucose levels in a variety of obese, insulin-resistant diabetic animal models including the KK-mouse, ob/ob mouse, Zucker Diabetic Fatty rat and db/db mouse. Similar effects are found in non-genetic diabetic animal models, including the fructose fed rat and high fat fed rat. Animal models characterized by severe hypoinsulinemia, e.g. the STZ rat, fail to respond to these agents unless treated with insulin. Thiazoiidinediones are also reported to restore the ability of insuiin to suppress HGO.<br>
Although the molecular target of insulin sensitizers and more specifically thiazolidinedione analogs is unknown, several studies suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR ys) may be the target and therefore that ligands to these receptors will be useful antihyperglycemic agents. Lehmann et ah J. Biol. Chem. 270: 12953-12956 (1995). PPAR ys are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors. At least three PPAR ys exist, namely the  and y receptors and thiazoiidinediones have been identified as ligands that activate the p and y receptors. Binding occurs at a concentration achieved in vivo and some data suggests that there is a correlation between PPAR y binding affinity and in vivo activity. Wilson et al. i Med. Chem. 39: 665-668 (1996).<br>
PPAR ys exist as a heterodimer with the retinoic acid X receptor (RXR). A co-repressor protein has been postulated to maintain the receptor in an inactive state similar to other nuclear receptors. Binding of molecules to the complex, i.e. PPAR y ligands and/or RXR ligands may lead to dissociation of the co-repressor protein and activation of the receptor, which in turn is postulated to interact with specific DNA sequences, PPRE's, and to activate or repress gene transcription. Accordingly, RXR ligands are thought to enhance insulin sensitivity and therefore be useful as antidiabetics either alone or in combination with PPAR y agonists such as a thiazolidinedione. Heyman et ai.. WO 97/10819. In db/db mice, the combination of an RXR ligand and a PPAR y agonist reduces glucose levels more than either component alone.<br>
Other classes of insulin sensitizers (i.e. non-thiazolidinediones) have been identified. For example, the insulin sensitizers SB 236636 and SB 219994 are 3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acids. These compounds are reported to bind to human PPAR y with high affinity. SB 236636 is equipment with thiazolidinedione BRL 49653 in stimulation of glucose transport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in glucose lowering activity in<br><br>
ob/ob mice. Young et al. Diabetes (1997). Relative to other thiazolidinediones, SB 236636 was shown to bind with higher affinity to crude extracts of Sf9 cells transfected with full length hPPAR  and rat adipocytes. This higher binding affinity correlated well with in vivo potency.<br>
Some data suggests that chronic activation of PK.C isoenzymes is involved in the generation of muscle insulin resistance and that insulin sensitizers may decrease the translocation of PKC isoenzymes from the cytosolic to particulate fractions in red skeletal muscle and therefore PKC activation. Schmitz-Peiffer et al. Am. J. Physiol. 273: E915-E921 (1997)<br>
Angiotensin II antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in enhancing insulin sensitivity based on potential interactions between angiotensin II and insulin signaling systems. Torlone et al.Diabetes Care 16: 1347-1355 (1993); Howard G. et al., Circulation 93: 1809-1817 (1996); Folli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 100: 2158-2169 (1997); Tamura et al., W09737688 A2.<br>
Thus, there are several mechanisms by which agents may act as insulin sensitizers.<br>
Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate is a highly regulated biosynthetic pathway requiring eleven enzymes. Seven enzymes catalyze reversible reactions and are common to both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Four enzymes catalyze reactions unique to gluconeogenesis, namely pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Overall flux through the pathway is controlled by the specific activities of these enzymes, the enzymes that catalyzed the corresponding steps in the glycolytic direction, and by substrate availability. Dietary factors (glucose, fat) and hormones (insulin, glucagon, glucocorticoids, epinephrine) coordinatively regulate enzyme activities in the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways through gene expression and post-translational mechanisms.<br>
Synthetic inhibitors of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (hereinafter "FBPase") have been reported. McNiel reported that fructose-2,6-bisphosphate analogs inhibit FBPase by binding to the substrate site. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106:7851-7853 (1984); U.S. Patent No. 4,968,790 (1984). These compounds, however, were relatively weak and did not inhibit glucose production in hepatocytes presumably due to poor cell penetration.<br>
Gruber reported that some nucleosides can lower blood glucose in the whole animal through inhibition of FBPase. These compounds exert their activity by first undergoing phosphorylation to the corresponding monophosphate. EP 0 427 799 Bl.<br><br>
Gruber et al. U.S. Patent No. 5.658,889 described the use of inhibitors of the AMP site of FBPase to treat diabetes. WO 98/39344, WO 98/39343, and WO 98/39342 describe the use of FBPase inhibitors to treat diabetes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The instant invention is a combination therapy and a composition for the treatment for diabetes and diseases responding to improved glycemic control or to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity. The therapy requires administration of a insulin sensitizer agent, e.g. PPAR y agonist, RXR ligand, or another agent known to enhance insulin action and an FBPase inhibitor either together or at a different time such that improved glycemic control is achieved. In another aspect of the invention, the combined therapy results in decreases in hepatic glucose output beyond that observed for glucose lowering doses of the insulin sensitizer agent. Furthermore, the combined therapy can result in improvements in insulin resistance and/or insulin secretion beyond that observed for either agent alone. Yet another aspect of the invention is that a combination therapy achieves similar benefits as observed with one or the other therapies alone but at significantly lower doses.<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating an animal having NIDDM or a condition associated widi insulin resistance by administering to the animal a composition containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of an agent that enhances insulin sensitivity and a pharmaceutically effective amount of an FBPase inhibitor. The compositions of this invention are adapted to cure, improve or prevent one or more symptoms of NIDDM. A preferred drug combination will have high potency and low toxicity.<br>
Another object of the invention relates to methods and compositions for treating insulin-requiring NIDDM patients. The combination therapy decreases the insulin requirement and associated safety risks.<br>
Another object of the invention relates to methods and compositions for treating diseases or conditions characterized by insulin resistance, including obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Individuals with syndrome X, renal disease, or pancreatitis are also effectively treated with the combination therapy.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is the use of insulin sensitizer to attenuate certain potentially adverse effects that could be associated with FBPase inhibitor therapy such as lactate and triglyceride elevation.<br>
Another object of the invention is the use of FBPase inhibitors to attenuate certain potentially adverse effects that could be associated with insulin sensitizers such as weight gain.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to use FBPase inhibitors in combination with insulin sensitizer therapies that include administration of agents that enhance endogenous or exogenous insulin levels, such as sulfonylureas, insulin, or insulin mimetics.<br>

The term "prodrug" as used herein refers to any compound that when administered to a biological system generates the "drug" substance (a biologically active compound) as a result of spontaneous chemical reaction(s), enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), and/or metabolic chemical reaction(s). Standard prodrugs are formed using groups attached to functionality, e.g. HO, HS-, HOOC-, R2N-, associated with the FBPase inhibitor, that cleave in vivo. Standard prodrugs include but are not limited to carboxylate esters where the group is alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, acyloxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl as well as esters of hydroxyl, thiol and amines where the group attached is an acyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, phosphate or sulfate. The groups illustrated are exemplary, not exhaustive, and one skilled in the art could prepare other known varieties of prodrugs. Such prodrugs of the compounds of formulae I and X, fall within the scope of the present invention. Prodrugs must undergo some form of a chemical transformation to produce the compound that is biologically active or is a precursor of the biologically active compound. In some cases, the prodrug is biologically active usually less than the drug itself, and serves to improve efficacy or safety through improved oral bioavailability, pharmacodynamic half-life, etc.<br>
The term "prodrug ester" as employed herein includes, but is not limited to, the following groups and combinations of these groups:<br>
[1] Acyloxyalkyl esters which are well described in the literature (Farquhar et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 72,324-325 (1983)) and are represented by formula A<br><br>
wherein	R, R', and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and<br>
alicyclic; (see WO 90/08155; WO 90/10636). [2] Other acyloxyalkyl esters are possible in which an alicyclic ring is formed such as shown in formula B. These esters have been shown to generate phosphorus-containing nucleotides inside cells through a postulated sequence of reactions beginning with deesterification and followed by a series of elimination reactions (e.g. Freed et al., Biochem. Pharm. 38: 3193-3198 (1989)).<br><br><br>
wherein R is -H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylamino, arylamino, cycloalkyl, or alicyclic.<br>
[3] Another class of these double esters known as alkyloxycarbonyloxymethyl esters, as shown in formula A, where R is alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylamino, and arylamino; R\ and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and alicyclic, have been studied in the area of p*-lactam antibiotics (Tatsuo Nishimura et al. J. Antibiotics, 1987, 40(1), 81-90; for a review see Ferres, H., Drugs of Today, 1983,79,499.). More recently Cathy, M. S., et al. (Abstract from AAPS Western Regional Meeting, April, 1997) showed that these alkyloxycarbonyloxymethyl ester prodrugs on (9-[(R)-2-phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) are bioavailable up to 30% in dogs.<br>
[4] Aryl esters have also been used as phosphonate prodrugs (e.g. Erion, DeLambert et al., J. Med. Chem. 37: 498, 1994; Serafinowska et al., J. Med. Chem. 38: 1372,1995). Phenyl as well as mono and poly-substituted phenyl proesters have generated the parent phosphonic acid in studies conducted in animals and in man (Formula C). Another approach has been described where Y is a carboxylic ester ortho to the phosphate. Khamnei and Torrance, J. Med. Chem.; 39:4109-4115 (1996).<br><br>
Formula C<br>
wherein	Y is H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, acyloxy, halogen, amino,<br><br>
alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, cyano, and alicyclic.<br>
[5] Benzyl esters have also been reported to generate the parent phosphonic acid. In some cases, using substituents at the para-position can accelerate the hydrolysis. Benzyl analogs with 4-acyloxy or 4-alkyloxy group [Formula D, X = H, OR or 0(CO)R or 0(CO)OR] can generate the 4-hydroxy compound more readily through the action of enzymes, e.g. oxidases, esterases, etc. Examples of this class of prodrugs are described in Mitchell et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 2345 (1992); Brook, et al. WO 91/19721.<br><br>
wherein	X and Y are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, acyloxy,<br>
hydroxy, cyano, nitro, perhaloalkyl, halo, or alkyloxycarbonyl; and<br>
R and R are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, halogen, and alicyclic.<br>
[6] Thio-containing phosphonate proesters have been described that are useful in the delivery of FBPase inhibitors to hepatocytes. These proesters contain a protected thioethyl moiety as shown in formula E. One or more of the oxygens of the phosphonate can be esterified. Since the mechanism that results in de-esterification requires the generation of a free thiolate, a variety of thiol protecting groups are possible. For example, the disulfide is reduced by a reductase-mediated process (Puech et al., Antiviral Res.. 22:155-174 (1993)). Thioesters will also generate free thiolatcs after esterase-mediated hydrolysis. Benzaria. et al.. J. Med. Chem.. 39:4958 (1996). Cyclic analogs are also possible and were shown to liberate phosphonate in isolated rat hepatocytes. The cyclic disulfide shown below has not been previously described and is novel.<br><br><br>
wherein Z is alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, ar&gt;'loxycarbonyl, or alkylthio.<br>
Other examples of suitable prodrugs include proester classes exemplified by Biller and Magnin (U.S. Patent No. 5,157,027); Serafinowska et al. (J. Med. Chem. 38, 1372 (1995)); Starrett et al. (J. Med. Chem. 37, 1857 (1994)); Martin et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 76, 180 (1987); Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 59, 1853 (1994)); and EPO patent application 0 632 048 Al. Some of the structural classes described are optionally substituted, including fused lactones attached at the omega position (formulae E-l and E-2) and optionally substituted 2-oxo-l,3-dioxolenes attached through a methylene to the phosphorus oxygen (formula E-3) such as:<br><br>
wherein R is -H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, or alicyclic; and<br>
wherein Y is -H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, cyano, alkoxy, acyloxy, halogen, amino, alicyclic, and alkoxycarbonyl.<br>
The prodrugs of Formula E-3 are an example of "optionally substituted alicyclic where the cyclic moiety contains a carbonate or thiocarbonate."<br>
[7] Propyl phosphonate proesters can also be used to deliver FBPase inhibitors into hepatocytes. These proesters may contain a hydroxyl and hydroxyl group derivatives at the 3-position of the propyl group as shown in formula F. The R and X groups can form a cyclic ring system as shown in formula F. One or more of the oxygens of the phosphonate can be esterified.<br><br><br>
wherein	R is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl;<br>
X is hydrogen, alkylcarbonyioxy, alkyloxycarbonyloxy; and<br>
Y is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkoxy, alkylamino, alkylthio, halogen,<br>
hydrogen, hydroxy, acyloxy, amino.<br>
[8] Phosphoramidate derivatives have been explored as phosphate prodrugs (e.g. McGuigan et al., J. hied. Chem., 1999, 42: 393 and references cited therein) and phosphonate prodrugs (Bischoiberger, et al, U.S. 5,798,340 and references cited therein) as shown in Formulae G and H.<br><br>
Cyclic phosphoramidates have also been studied as phosphonate prodrugs because of their speculated higher stability compared to non-cyclic phosphoramidates (e.g. Starrett et al., J. Med. Chem., 1994,37: 1857).<br>
Another type of nucleotide prodrug was reported as the combination of S-acyl-2-thioethyl ester and phosphoramidate (Egron et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 1999,18, 981) as shown in Formula J.<br><br><br>
Other prodrugs are possible based on literature reports such as substituted ethyls for example. bis(trichloroethyl)esters as disclosed by McGuigan, et al. Bioorg Med. Chem Lett,, 3:1207-1210 (1993), and the phenyl and benzyl combined nucleotide esters reported by Meier. C. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 7:99-104 (1997).<br>

has a plane of symmetry running through the phosphorus-oxygen double bond when R6=R6, V=W, W'=H, and V and W are either both pointing up or both pointing down. The same is true of structures where each -NR6 is replaced with -0-.<br>

Insulin sensitizers used in this invention are compounds that alter the body's response to endogenous or exogeneous insulin or insulin-like molecules. This reponse can include an improvement in whole-body glucose disposal, a reduction in hepatic glucose output, an increase in insulin-mediated glycogenesis, and other manifestations of improved peripheral insulin resistance. In some instances, the insulin sensitizers used in this invention may also lower circulating triglycerides and/or free fatty acids, may increase HDL cholesterol levels, may reduce hyperinsulinemia, or may improve the pancreatic insulin secretory response. Examples of insulin sensitizers include compounds that activate or are agonists of the PPAR receptor, are ligands of RXR that activate transcriptional activity of the RXR:PPAR y heterodimer, or are compounds that achieve enhanced insulin sensitivity through modulation of enzyme activities in cell signalling pathways associated with insulin receptor activation. Enzymes in the latter pathways include protein kinase C, tyrosine phosphatase, PI-3-kinase, MAP kinase, and others. The insulin sensitizers used in this invention have affinity for PPARy 1, PPARy2, and/or other isoforms of the PPARy family, and contain either a thiazolidinedione ring structure, a<br><br>
modified thiazolidinedione ring structure, or have a structure that is unrelated to the thiazolidinediones (eg. the 3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acids). The insulin sensitizers also include compounds with affinity for RXR, RXRP, RXRy and/or other RXR receptor isoforms, and are either retinoids such as 9-cis-retinoic acid and its analogs, rexinoids such as (tetrarnethyltetrahydronaphthyl)carbonylbenzoic acid analogs, or are of other structural classes. Insulin sensitizers used in this invention typically exhibit activity in assays known to be useful for characterizing compounds that act as insulin sensitizers. The assays include but are not limited to: (a) PPARy binding assays; (b) RXR or RXR-PPARy activation assays (eg. co-transfection or cis-trans assays); (c) insulin signaling assays such as those measuring receptor or signaling protein phosphorylation/expression (d) adipocyte binding assays; (e) glucose uptake assays in adipocytes or L6 myocytes; (f) adipocyte differentiation assays using triglyceride accumulation, glucose oxidation, or fat/carbohydrate metabolism gene expression as indeces; (g) insulin secretion assays in beta cell islets or the perfused pancreas; (h) pancreatic islet histology assays; (i) in vivo glucose disposal assays; (j) whole body insulin sensitivity assays using the in vivo hyperinsulinemic-glucose clamp technique; (k) hepatic glucose output assays utilizing labeling or NMR techniques; and (1) antihyperglycemic and/or triglyceride/free fatty acid lowering activity in animal models of diabetes such as the KK, ob/ob, or db/db mouse or the ZDF rat.<br>
Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
The instant invention is a combination therapy and a composition for the treatment for diabetes and diseases responding to increased glycemic control or to decreased insulin levels. The combination therapy consists of administering one or more FBPase inhibitors and one or more agents known to enhance insulin action, i.e. an insulin sensitizer agent. Known insulin sensitizers include thiazolidinediones, PPAR y agonists, RXR Hgands and inhibitors of the RAX system or angiotensin II action. The therapy is useful for treating diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance. Such diseases include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and polycystic ovarian syndrome, pancreatitis and renal disease.<br>
In some cases, the combined therapy provides a method for improved glycemic control. The combined therapy will provide improved therapy for one or more of these conditions relative to either agent alone. The combined therapy provides a method for<br><br>
improved giycemic control in NIDDM subjects beyond that achievable by either agent alone. The combined therapy can result in decreases in hepatic glucose output beyond that observed for glucose-lowering doses of the insulin sensitizer agent. Furthermore, the combined therapy can result in improvements in insulin resistance and/or insulin secretion beyond that observed for FBPase inhibitors. In other cases, combining an insulin sensitizer with an FBPase inhibitor or visa versa has an insignificant effect on glycemia but instead results in an improved therapy by minimizing potential adverse pharmacologies sometimes associated with FBPase and insulin sensitizer therapies. For example, FBPase therapy may be associated with elevations of lactate, tryglicerides, free fatty acids or potential side-effects resulting from the renal clearance of the inhibitor. Insulin sensitizer therapy is known to be associated with weight gain, elevation of liver enzymes, and reductions in heamatocrit. In still another aspect of the invention is that the combination therapy achieves similar benefits as observed with one or the other therapies alone but at significantly lower doses. The lower doses improve or eliminate side effects and/or toxicologies associated with the individual drug treatment. The combined therapy entails administration to the host the agents either separately or simultaneously.<br>
Most preferred would be the administration of both agents simultaneously in either the same capsule or as separate pills. Another preferred embodiment is the administration of both agents during meal time (just prior to feeding or just after feeding). Another preferred embodiment is the administration of the insulin sensitizer during meal time and the FBPase inhibitor during times of fasting such as at bed time.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered for therapy by any suitable route including, oral, rectal, nasal, topical, vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) and transdermal. The preferred route is oral.<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating a host having NIDDM or a condition associated with insulin resistance by administering to the host a composition containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of an agent that enhances insulin sensitivity and a pharmaceutically effective amount of an FBPase inhibitor. The compositions of this invention are adapted to cure, improve or prevent one or more symptoms of NIDDM. A preferred drug combination will have high potency and low toxicity as can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animal models, e.g. by determining the LD50 and the ED50.<br><br>
Preferred FBPase inhibitors encompassed by the instant invention are compounds that inhibit enzyme activity as determined by conducting in vitro inhibition studies (Examples A - D). In some cases, in vivo metabolic activation of a compound may be required to generate the FBPase inhibitor. This class of compounds may be inactive in the enzyme inhibition screen (Example A), may or may not be active in hepatocytes (Examples C and D), but is active in vivo as evidenced by glucose lowering in the normal, fasted rat (Examples E and F) and/or in animal models of diabetes (Examples N-T).<br>

The insulin sensitizers encompassed by the invention are compounds that improve insulin sensitivity as measured, for instance, by conducting standard assays such as those described in Examples H through M.<br>
More preferred are the following insulin sensitizers:<br><br><br><br><br>
Especially preferred PPAR y agonists are Troglitazone, Pioglitazone, ciglitazone, WAY-120,744, englitazone, AD 5075, SB219994, SB219993, BRL49$53, Gl-262570, darglitazone and analogs thereof, Preferred RXR ligands are described in e.g. Heyman et al., WO9710819 Al;<br>
Especially preferred RXR ligands are LG100268, LGD 1069, ALRT 1057 and analogs thereof.<br>
Other classes of insulin sensitizers are within the scope of the invention and include non-thiazolidinediones) such as SB 236636 and SB 219994, which are<br><br>
3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acids, PK.C inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.<br>
As expected from their mechanism of action, insulin-sensitizers are primarily effective in the hyperinsulinemic, early stages of type 2 diabetes. Efficacy is considerably reduced in advanced diabetes which is associated with severely disturbed beta-cell function and hence diminished insulin levels. This drug profile has been observed both in animal models of the disease as well as in the clinic. Hyperglycemia in young, hyperinsulinemic ZDF rats, for instance, is completely reversed by treatment with Troglitazone. Sreenan et al. Am. J. Physiol. 271: E742-747. ZDF rats in a more advanced, hypomsulinemic phase of the disease, however, respond poorly to insulin sensitizer treatment. Brown et al. Diabetes 48: 1415-1424(1999). In addition, hypoinsulinemic, streptozotocin induced diabetic mice do not respond to Troglitazo'ne treatment. Fujiwara et al. Diabetes 37: 1549-1558 (1988). Clinical trials with Troglitazone have brought to light similarly variable responses in type 2 diabetics, with the non-response rate ranging from 35-62%. Valiquett T. et al. Diabetes 44 (Suppl. 1): 406A (1995). In these trials it was found that the best predictor of efficacy was fasting insulin C peptide levels; the higher the C-peptide level, the greater the glucose-lowering effect in patients. Maggs DG et al. Ann. Intern. Med 128:176-185 (1998). Patients with sufficient pancreatic insulin secretory function thus respond well to therapy, whereas patients with decreased pancreatic function, characteristic of more advanced diabetes, respond poorly or are non-responders to therapy.<br>
Insulin sensitizer treatment in general falls short of restoring euglycemia or normalizing HbAlc levels in atients. In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, for example, average blood glucose lowering and HbAlc reductions were ~50 mg/dl and 0.6%, respectively. Mathisen et al. Diabetes 48 (Suppl. 1): 441A (1998). In the patient populations treated, average reductions of &gt; 140 mg/dl and &gt;3% would have been necessary to restore these parameters to normal values. A high rate of non-response and overall modest reductions in blood glucose levels have also been observed in clinical trials with Rosiglitazone. Patel et al. Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism 1: 165-172 (1999). There thus appears ample opportunity for agents such as the FBPase inhibitors to provide a benefit in combination with insulin sensitizers in the clinic.<br>
FBPase inhibitors are likely to be efficacious both in early and advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. In animal studies they significantly lowered blood glucose in the<br><br>
flemjc db/db mouse (a mode! of early type 2 diabetes, Examples S and T) as Well as in a model of advanced type 2 diabetes: the insulinopenic streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat. In the ZDF rat, FBPase inhibitors were effective both in early diabetes (8-9 weeks of age, Examples N-R) as well as in advanced diabetes (16 weeks of age). Based on the pharmacological profile described above, the combination of FBPase inhibitors and insulin sensitizers will be effective across a broad patient population. In early stage diabetics, the insulin sensitizer and FBPase inhibitor are both likely to be fully effective, whereas in advanced diabetics, the response to insulin sensitizers may be partial whereas the FBPase inhibitor will maintain robust efficacy. The benefit of the combination in advanced diabetes will be a significant reduction in the number of non-responders to therapy (Example R). While the initial response of the combination may in large part be due to treatment with the FBPase inhibitor, blood glucose lowering may improve pancreatic function (Example P) and allow the insulin sensitizer to become more folly effective over time and in the long term provide enhanced giycemic control. In some cases, insulin sensitizers are best used in combination with agents that improve the actions of the insulin sensitizer, such as insulin, insulin analogs, RXR ligands, or insulin secretogogues (eg. the sulfonylureas). With the actions of the insulin sensitizer thus enhanced, combination treatment with an FBPase inhibitor will result in more effective giycemic control. Moreover, long term treatment will diminish the need for agents that enhance insulin levels.<br>
FBPase inhibitors lower blood glucose both in the fasted (example T) and the fed state (examples N-S). This provides a broad opportunity for therapy in combination with insulin sensitizers. The combination could, for instance, be administered at mealtime and provide enhanced giycemic control over either agent alone by simultaneously enhancing glucose disposal and reducing the contribution of gluconeogenesis to hyperglycemia during the postprandial period. Meal time administration has the additional benefit of reducing the potential risk of hypoglycemia that could ensue from treatment with an FBPase inhibitor. Another possible dosing regimen may be the administation of the insulin sensitizer during the daytime, and administration of the FBPase inhibitor separately at bedtime. The insulin sensitizer will thus provide giycemic control by enhancing glucose disposal following daytime meals, whereas the FBPase inhibitor will control excessive glucose production by the liver known to occur to a greater extent during the overnight fast. There is precedent for the use of a hepatic glucose production suppressor<br><br>
during the overnight fast; insulin has been widely used in this application. Riddle, The Lancet 192-195(1985).<br>
An additional benefit of combination treatment is that it will allow a reduction in dose of both agents thereby reducing potential side effects. The most common side-effect of Trogiitazone, for example, is hepatotoxicity which manifests itself as the elevation of liver enzymes (1% of patients). This side-effect has resulted in a recommendation for liver function monitoring every month for the first six months of treatment. In addition, an association between Trogiitazone and increased heart weight in animals has led to recommendations that this drug be used cautiously in patients with congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone treatment, although not reported to cause liver enzyme elevations, is known to significantly decrease haematocrit. All insulin sensitizers cause weight gain. As discussed above, in some cases efficacy with an insulin sensitizer can only be achieved with supplemental insulin or sulfonylurea administrations. Insulin has the undesirable side-effects of promoting weight gain, of exacerbating insulin resistance, and predisposing to hypoglycemia. Sulfonylureas also promote weight gain, increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and by overstimulating the pancreas can promote beta-cell degeneration. In certain animal models, FBPase inhibitors are known to elevate blood lactate and triglycerides and could therefore predispose to systemic acidosis and the vascular complication associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Combination treatment with an insulin sensitizer may suppress the potential lactate and triglyceride elevations associated with FBPase inhibitor treatment (Examples O and Q). Other side effects of FBPase inhibitors may manifest themselves in man. By treating patients with the combination of an insulin sensitizer and an FBPase inhibitor, the reduced dosages feasible are likely to significantly decrease the risks of the (potential) side-effects associated with the individual therapies.<br>
While an insulin sensitizer-FBPase inhibitor combination is primarily envisaged for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the associated renal, neuronal, retinal, micro- and macro-vascular and metabolic complications, treatment of other diseases that respond to improved glycemic control and improved insulin sensitivity is also possible. Patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are minimally hyperglycemic under ordinary circumstances but can become hyperglycemic following the ingestion of large glucose loads. IGT is a predictor of future diabetes and patients with this condition have become the target of diabetes prevention trials in recent years. Combination treatment of these<br><br>
patients, particularly at mealtime, restores a normal glucose response and reduces the risk of the development of diabetes. Another distinct group of subjects at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes are women who suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (POCS). Combination treatment is of benefit in these patients as well since they are typically, hyperinsulinemic, insulin resistant, and can suffer from IGT. Combination treatment is also useful for treating renal dysfunction and hypertension particularly in obese, insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic patients with IGT. Other applications of combination treatment include gestational diabetes, poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia.<br>

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be administered as a daily dose or an appropriate fraction of the daily dose (e.g. bid).

Chem.35: 4549-4556 (1992); Paul, Jr. J. Med. Chem. 28: 1704-1716 (1985); Cohen et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 95: 4619-4624 (1973).<br>
Compounds of formulae II-IV are prepared according to the procedures described in PCT publication numbers WO 98/39344, WO 98/39343, and WO 98/39342.<br>
Section 1.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
Synthesis of compounds encompassed by the present invention typically includes some or all of the following general steps: (1) preparation of a phosphonate prodrug; (2) deprotection of a phosphonate ester, (3) modification of a heterocycle; (4) coupling of a heterocycle with a phosphonate component; (5) construction of a heterocycle; (6) ring closure to construct a heterocycle with a phosphonate moiety present and (7) preparation of useful intermediates. These steps are illustrated in the following scheme for compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is a 5-membered heteroaromatic ring. Compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is a 6-member heteroaromatic ring or other heteroaromatic rings are prepared in an analogous manner.<br><br><br>
(la) Preparation of a phosphonate prodrug<br>
Prodrugs can be introduced at different stages of the synthesis. Most often these prodrugs are made from the phosphonic acids of formula 2, because of their lability. Advantageously, these prodrugs can be introduced at an earlier stage, provided that it can withstand the reaction conditions of the subsequent steps.<br>
Compounds of formula 2, can be alkylated with electrophiles (such as alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, etc) under nucleophilic substitution reaction conditions to give phosphonate esters. For example, compounds of formula I, wherein R is an acyloxyalkyl group can be-synthesized through direct alkylation of compounds of formula 2 with an appropriate acyloxyalkyl halide (e.g. CI, Br, I; Elhaddadi, et al Phosphorus Sulfur, 1990, 54(1-4): 143; Hoffmann, Synthesis, 1988, 62) in the presence of a base (e.g. N, N'-dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine, Hunigs base, etc.) in suitable solvents such as<br><br>
1,1-dimethyl formamide ("DMF") (Starrett, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857). The carboxylate component of these acyloxyalkyl halides includes but is not limited to acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, pivalate, benzoate, and other carboxylates. When appropriate, further modification are envisioned after the formation of these acyloxyalkyl phosphonate esters such as reduction of a nitro group. For example, compounds of formula 3 wherein A is a N02 group can be converted to compounds of formula 3 wherein A is an H2N- group under suitable reduction conditions (Dickson, et al, /. Med. Chem., 1996, 39: 661; Iyer, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30: 7141; Srivastva, et al, Bioorg. Chem., 1984, 12: 118). These methods can be extended to the synthesis of other types of prodrugs, such as compounds of formula I where R1 is a 3-phthalidyl, a 2-oxo-4,5-didehydro-l,3-dioxolanemethyl, or a 2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5-yl group (Biller et al., US 5,157,027; Serafinowska et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995,38: 1372; Starrett et al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37: 1857; Martin et al., /. Pharm. Sci. 1987, 76: 180; Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 1994, 59: 1853; EPO 0632048A1). MW-Dimethylformamide dialkyl acetals can also be used to alkylate phosphonic acids (Alexander, P., et al Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994,59, 1853).<br>
Alternatively, these phosphonate prodrugs can also be synthesized by reactions of the corresponding dichiorophosphonates with an alcohol-(Alexander et al, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853). For example, reactions of a dichlorophosphonate with substituted phenols and aralkyl alcohols in the presence of base (e.g. pyridine, triethylamine, etc) yield compounds of formula V where R1 is an aryl group (Khamnei et al.,/. Med. Chem., 1996,39: 4109; Serafinowska et al.,/. Med. Chem., 1995, 38: 1372; De Lombaert et al., /. Med. Chem., 1994, 37: 498) or an arylalkyl group (Mitchell et al., /. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. J, 1992,38: 2345). The disulfide-containing prodrugs (Puech et al., Antiviral Res., 1993,22: 155) can also be prepared from a dichlorophosphonate and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide under standard conditions.<br>
Such reactive dichiorophosphonates can be generated from the corresponding phosphonic acids with a chlorinating agent (e.g. thionyl chloride: Starrett et al., /. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857, oxalyl chloride: Stowell et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31: 3261, and phosphorus pentachloride: Quast et al., Synthesis, 1974, 490). Alternatively, a dichlorophosphonate can also be generated from its corresponding disilyl phosphonate esters (Bhongle et al., Synth. Commun., 1987,17: 1071) or dialkyl phosphonate esters (Still et al.. Tetrahedron Lett., 1983, 24: 4405; Patois et al.. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1993,<br><br>
J 30: 485).<br>
Furthermore, these prodrugs can be prepared using Mitsunobu reactions (Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1; Campbell, J. Org. Chem., 1992, 52: 6331), and other coupling reactions (e.g. using carbodiimides: Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853; Casara et ah, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1992,2: 145; Ohashi et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1988, 29: 1189, and benzotriazolyloxytris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium salts: Campagne et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1993,34: 6743). Compounds of formula I wherein R1 is a cyclic carbonate, a lactone or a phthalidyl group can also be synthesized via direct alkylation of the free phosphonie acid with appropriate halides in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. NaH or diisopropylethylamine, Biller et al., US 5,157,027; Serafinowska et ah, J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38: 1372; Starrett et al.,/. Med. Chem. 1994, 37: 1857; Martin et ah, J. Pharm. Sci. 1987, 76: 180; Alexander et ah, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1994, 59: 1853;EPO0632048Al).<br>
R can also be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis provided that it is compatible with the subsequent reaction steps. For example, compounds of formula I where R1 is an aryl group can be prepared by metalation of a 2-furanyl heterocycle (e.g. using LDA) followed by trapping the anion with a diaryl chlorophosphate.<br>
It is envisioned that compounds of formula V can be mixed phosphonate esters (e.g. phenyl and benzyl esters, or phenyl and acyloxyalkyl esters) including the chemically combined mixed esters such as the phenyl and benzyl combined prodrugs reported by Meier, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1997, 7: 99.<br>
(lb) Preparation of a bfoamidatc phosphonate General synthesis of bis-phosphoroamidate prodrugs:<br>
In general, the bis-phosphoroamidates of formula I, where both -NRI5R16 and<br>
are from the same amino acid residues can be prepared from the activated phosphonates for example, dichlorophosphonate, by coupling with an aminoacid ester for example, glycine ethylester with or without base for example, N-methylimidazole. The reactive dichloridates, can be prepared as described above in the general prodrug section<br>
Alternatively, these bis-phosphoroamidates can be prepared by reacting the corresponding phosphonie acid with an aminoacid ester for example, glycine ethylester in<br><br>
presence of PPh3 and 2,2'-dipyridyi disulfide in pyridine as described in WO 95/07920 or Mukaiyama, T. et al, J Am. Chem. Soc. 1972, 94, 8528.<br>
Synthesis of mixed bis-phosphoroamidates of formula IA, where -NR15R16 and -N(R )-(CRuR' )nC(O)-R14 are different aminoacid esters or a combination of an aminoaeid ester and a substituted amine can be prepared by direct conversion via diehloridate as described above (sequential addition) followed by separation of the required product by column chromatography or HPLC. Alternatively, these mixed bis-phosphoroamidates can be prepared starting with an appropriate phosphonate monoester such as phenyl ester or benzyl ester to give the mixed phosphonoesteramide via the chloridate, followed by ester hydrolysis under conditions where the amide bond is stable. The resultant mono-amide can be converted to a mixed bis-amide by condensation with a<br>
second amino ester or a substituted amine via the chloridate, as described above. Synthesis of such monoesters can be prepared using the reported procedure (EP 481 214).<br>
The substituted cyclic propyl phosphonate esters can be synthesized by reactions of the corresponding dichlorophosphonate with a substituted 1,3-propanediol. Some of the methods useful for the preparation of a substituted 1,3-propanediol are discussed below.<br>
Synthesis of a 1.3-propanediol<br>
Various synthetic methods can be used to prepare numerous types of 1,3-propanediols: (i) 1-substituted, (ii) 2-substituted, (iii) 1,2- or 1,3-annulated 1,3-propanediols. Substituents on the prodrug moiety of compounds of formula I (i.e. substituents on the 1,3-propanediol moiety) can be introduced or modified either during the synthesis of these diols or after the coupling of these diols to compounds of formula 2.<br>
ffl 1-Substftuted 1.3-propaaediols<br>
1,3-PropanedioIs useful in the synthesis of compounds in the present invention can be prepared using various synthetic methods. Additions of a aryl Grigriard to a 1-hydroxy-propan-3-al give 1-aryl-substituted 1,3-propanediols (path a). This method is suitable for the conversion of various aryl haiides to 1-arylsubstituted- 1,3-propanediols (Coppi et. al, J. Org. Chem., 1988,53, 911). Conversions of aryl haiides to 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols can also be achieved using Heck reactions (e.g. couplings with a 1,3-diox-4-ene) followed by reductions and subsequent hydrolysis reactions (Sakamoto et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1992,33, 6845). Various aromatic aldehydes can also be converted to<br><br>
1 -substituted- 1,3-propanediols using alkenyl Grignard addition reactions followed by hydroboration reactions (path b). Additions of a metailated t-butyl acetate to aromatic aldehydes followed by reduction of the ester (path e) are also useful for the synthesis of 1,3-propanediols (Turner., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55 4744). In another method, epoxidations of cinnamyl alcohols using known methods (e.g. Sharpless epoxidations and other asymmetric epoxidation reactions) followed by a reduction reaction (e.g. using Red-Al) give various 1,3-propanediols (path c). Alternatively, enantiomerically pure 1,3-propanediols can be obtained using chiral borane reduction reactions of hydroxyethyl aryl ketone derivatives (Ramaehandran et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1997,38 761). Propan-3-ols with a 1-heteroaryl substituent (e.g. a pyridyl, a quinolinyl or an isoquinolinyl) can be oxygenated to give 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols using N-oxide formation reactions followed by a rearrangement reaction in acetic anhydride conditions (path d) (Yamamoto et. al., Tetrahedron , 1981, 37, 1871).<br><br><br>
Hi) 2-Substituted 1,3-propanediols<br>
A variety of 2-substituted 1,3-propancdiols useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula I can be prepared from 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediols using known chemistry (Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). For example, reductions of a trialkoxycarbonylmethane under known conditions give a triol via complete reduction (path a) or a bis(hydroxymethyl)acetic acid via selective hydrolysis of one of the ester groups followed by reduction of the remaining two other ester groups. Nitrotriols are also known to give triols via reductive elimination (path b) (Latour et. al., Synthesis, 1987, 8, 742). Furthermore, a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol can be converted to a mono acylated derivative (e.g. acetyl, methoxycarbonyl) using an acyl chloride or an alkyl chloroformate (e.g. acetyl chloride or methyl chloroformate) (path d) using known chemistry (Greene et al., Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis ; Wiley, New York, 1990). Other functional group manipulations can<br><br>
also be used to prepare 1,3-propanedtols such as oxidation of one the hydroxylmethyl groups in a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-t,3-propanediol to an aldehyde followed by addition reactions with an aryl Grignard (path c). Aldehydes can also be converted to alkyl amines via reductive amination reactions (path e).<br><br>
(iii) Annulatcd 1.3-propane diols<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein V and Z or V and W are connected by four carbons to form a ring can be prepared from a 1,3-cyclohexanedioI. For example, cis, cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol can be modified as described for 2-substituted 1,3-propanediols. It is envisioned that these modifications can be performed either before or after formation of a cyclic phosphonate 1,3-propanediol ester. Various 1,3-cyclohexanediols can also be prepared using Diels-Alder reactions (e.g. using a pyrone as the diene: Posner et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 5295). 1,3-Cyclohexanediol derivatives are also prepared via<br><br>
other cycloaddition reaction methodologies. For example, cycioadditon of a nitrile oxide to an olefin followed by conversion of the resulting cycloadduct to a 2-ketoethanol derivative can be converted to a 1,3-cylohexanediol using known chemistry (Curran, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 6023). Alternatively, precursors to 1,3-cyclohexanediol can be made from quinic acid (Rao, et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 547.)<br>
2) Deprotection of a phosphonate ester<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R' is H may be prepared from phosphonate esters using known phosphate and phosphonate ester cleavage conditions. Silyl halides are generally used to cleave various phosphonate esters, and subsequent mild hydrolysis of the resulting silyl phosphonate esters give the desired phosphonic acids. When required, acid scavengers (e.g. 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, 2,6-lutidine, etc:) can be used for the synthesis of acid labile compounds. Such silyl halides include chlorotrimethylsilane (Rabinowitz, J. Org. Chem., 1963,28: 2975), and bromotrimethylsilane (McKenna, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1977,155), and iodotrimethylsilane (Blackburn, et al, J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun., 1978,870). Alternately, phosphonate esters can be cleaved under strong acidie conditions (e.g. HBr or HC1: Moffatt, et al, U.S. Patent 3.524,846,1970). These esters can also be cleaved via dichlorophosphonates, prepared by treating the esters with haiogenating agents (e.g. phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride, BBr3: Pelchowicz et al, J. Chem. Soc, 1961,238) followed by aqueous hydrolysis to give phosphonic acids. Aryl and benzyl phosphonate esters can be cleaved under hydrogenolysis conditions (Lejczak, et al, Synthesis, 1982, 412; Elliott, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1985,28:1208; Baddiley, et al, Nature, 1953, 171: 76 ) or metal reduction conditions (Shafer, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1977,99: 5118). Electrochemical (Shono, et al, J. Org. Chem., 1979,44: 4508) and pyrolysis (Gupta, et al, Synth. Commun., 1980,10: 299) conditions have also been used to cleave various phosphonate esters.<br>
(3) Modification of an existing beterocvele<br>
Syntheses of the heterocycles encompassed in the disclosed compounds have been well studied and described in numerous reviews (see section 4). Although it is advantageous to have the desired substituents present in these heterocycles before synthesis of compounds of formula 4, in some cases, the desired substituents are not compatible with subsequent reactions, and therefore modifications of an existing heterocycle are required late in the synthetic scheme using conventional chemistry<br><br>
(Larock, Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989; Trost, Comprehensive organic synthesis; Pergamon press, New York, 1991). For example, compounds of formula I wherein A, A", or B is a halo or a cyano group can be prepared from the corresponding amine group by conversion to the diazonium group and reaction with various copper (I) salts (e.g. Cul, CuBr, CuCl, CuCN). Halogens can also be introduced by direct halogenations of various heterocycles. For example, 5-unsubstituted-2-aminothiazoles can be converted to 2-amino-5-halothiazoles using various reagents (e.g. NIS, NBS, NCS). Heteroaryl halides are also useful intermediates and are often readily converted to other substituents (such as A, A", B, B", C", D, D", E and E") via transition metal assisted coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Heck or Stille reactions (Farina et al, Organic Reactions, Vol. 50; Wiley, New York, 1997; Mitchell, Synthesis, 1992, 808; Suzuki, PureApp. Chem., 1991, 63,419; Heck Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis; Academic Press: San Diego, 1985). Compounds of formula I wherein A is a carbamoyl group can be made from their corresponding alkyl carboxylate esters via aminolysis with various amines, and conventional functional group modifications of the alkyl carboxylate esters are useful for syntheses of compounds of formula I wherein A is a -CH3OH group or a -CH2-halo group. Substitution reactions of haloheterocycles (e.g. 2-bromothiazole, 5-bromothiazole) with various nucleophiles (e.g. HSMe, HOMe, etc.) represents still another method for introducing substituents such as A, A", B and B". For example, substitution of a 2-chlorothiazole with methanethiol gives the corresponding 2-methylthiothiazole.<br>
It is envisioned that when necessary alkylation of nitrogen atoms in the heterocycles (e.g. imidazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles and 1,2,3,4-tetrazoles) can be readily performed using for example standard alkylation reactions (with an alkyl halide, an-aralkyl halide, an alkyl sulfonate or an aralkyl sulfonate), or Mitsunobu reactions (with an alcohol).<br>
(4) Coupling of a heterocvcle with a phosphonate component<br>
When feasible compounds disclosed in the present invention are advantageously prepared via a convergent synthetic route entailing the coupling of a heterocycle with a phosphonate diester component.<br>
Transition metal catalyzed coupling reactions such as Stille or Suzuki reactions are particularly suited for the synthesis of compounds of formula I. Coupling reactions between a heteroaryl halide or triflate (e.g. 2-bromopyridine) and a M-P03R' wherein M is a 2-(5-tributylstannyt)furanyl or a 2-(5-boronyl)furanyl group under palladium catalyzed reaction conditions (Farina et al, Organic Reactions, Vol. 50; Wiley, New York, 1997; Mitchell, Synthesis, 1992, 808; Suzuki, PureApp. Chem., 1991, 63, 419) yield compounds of formula I wherein X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. It is envisioned that the nature of the<br><br>
coupling partners for these reactions can also be reversed (e.g. coupling of trialkylstannyl or boronyl heterocycles with a halo-X-P(O)(O-aIkyl),). Other coupling reactions between organostannes and an alkenyl halide or an alkenyl triflate are also reported which may be used to prepared compounds of formula I wherein X is an alkenyl group. The Heck reaction may be used to prepare compounds of formula V wherein X is an alkynyl group (Heck Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis; Academic Press: San Diego, 1985). These reactions are particularly suited for syntheses of various heteroaromatics as R5 for compounds of formula I given the availability of numerous halogenated heterocycles, and these reactions are particularly suitable for parallel synthesis (e.g. combinatorial synthesis on solid phase(Bunin, B. A., The Combinatorial Index,; Academic press: San Diego, 1998) or in solution phase (Flynn, D. L. et at., Curr. Op. Drug. Disc. Dev., 1998, J, 1367)) to generate large combinatorial libraries. For example, ethyl 5-iodo-2-furanylphosphonate can be coupled to Wang's resin under suitable coupling reaction conditions. The resin-coupled 5-iodo-2-[5-{O-ethyl-O-Wang's resin)phosphono]furan can then be subjected to transition metal catalyzed Suzuki and Stille reactions (as described above) with organoboranes and organotins in a parallel manner to give libraries of compounds of formula 3 wherein X is furan-2,5-diyl.<br>
Substitution reactions are useful for the coupling of a heterocycle with a phosphonate diester component. For example, cyanuric chloride can be substituted with dialkyl mercaptoalkylphosphonates or dialkyl aminoalkylphosphonates to give compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is a 1,3,5-triazine, X is an alkylthio or an alkylamino group. Alkylation reactions are also used for the coupling of a heterocycle with a phosphonate diester component. For example, a heteroaromatic thiol (e.g. a l,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol) can be alkylated with a dialkyl methylphosphonate derivative (e.g. ICH2P(O)(OEt)2, TsOCH2P(O)(OEt)2, TfDCH2P(O)(OEt)2) to lead to compounds of formula I wherein X is an alkylthio group. In another aspect, alkylation reactions of a heteroaromatic carboxylic acid (e.g. a thiazole-4-carboxylic acid) with a dialkyl methylphosphonate derivative (e.g. ICH2P(OXOEt)2, TsOCH2P(OXOEt)2, TfOCH2P(OXOEt)2) lead to compounds of formula I wherein X is an alkoxycarbonyl group, while alkylation reactions of a heteroaromatic thiocarboxylic acid (e.g. a thiazole-4-thiocarboxylic acid) with a dialkyl methylphosphonate derivative (e.g. lCH2P(O)(OEt)2, TsOCH2P(O)(OEt)2, TfOCH2P(OXOEt)2) lead to compounds of formula I wherein X is an alkylthiocarbonyl group. Substitutions of haloalkyl heterocycles (e.g. 4-haloalkylthiazole) with nucleophiles containing the phosphonate group (diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate) are useful for the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein X is an alkoxyalkyl or an alkylthioalkyl group. For example, compounds of formula I where X is a -CH2OCH2- group can be prepared from 2-chloromethylpyridine or 4-chloromethylthiazole using dialkyl<br><br>
hydroxymethylphosphonates and a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride). It is possible to reverse the nature of the nucleophiles and electrophiles for the substitution reactions, i.e. haloalkyl- and/or sulfonylalkylphosphonate esters can be substituted with heterocycles containing a nucleophiie (e.g. a 2-hydroxyalkylpyridine, a 2-mercaptoalkylpyridine, or a 4-hydroxyalkyloxazole).<br>
Known amide bond formation reactions (e.g. the acyl halide method, the mixed anhydride method, the carbodiimide method) can also be used to couple a heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with a phosphonate diester component leading to compounds of formula 4 wherein X is an alkylaminocarbonyl or an alkoxycarbonyl group. For example, couplings of a thiazole-4-carboxylic acid with a dialkyl aminoalkylphosphonate or a dialkyl hydroxyalkylphosphonate give compounds of formula 4 wherein Rs is a thiazole, and X is an alkylaminocarbonyl or an alkoxycarbonyl group. Alternatively, the nature of the coupling partners can be reversed to give compounds of formula 4 wherein X is an alkylcarbonylamino group. For example, 2-aminothiazoles can be coupled with (RO)2P(O)-alkyl-C02H (e.g. diethylphosphonoacetic acid) under these reaction conditions to give compounds of formula 4 wherein R5 is a thiazole and X is an alkylcarbonylamino group. These reactions are also useful for parallel synthesis of compound libraries through combinatorial chemistry on solid phase or in solution phase. For example, HOCH2P(O)(OEtXO-resin), H2NCH2P(C0(OEt)(O-resin) and HOOCCH2P(O)(OEt)(O-resin) (prepared using known methods) can be coupled to various heterocycles using the above described reactions to give libraries of compounds of formula 3 wherein X is a -C(O)OCH2-, or a -C(O)NHCH2-, or a -NHC(O)CH2-.<br>
Rearrangement reactions can also be used to prepare compounds covered in the present invention. For example, the Curtius's rearrangement of a thiazole-4-carboxylic acid in the presence of a dialkyl hydroxyalkylphosphonate or a dialkyl aminoalkylphosphonate lead to compounds of formula 4 wherein X is an alkylaminocarbonylamino or an alkoxycarbonylamino group. These reactions can also be adopted for combinatorial synthesis of various libraries of compounds of formula 3. For example, Curtius's rearrangement reactions between a heterocyclic carboxylic acid and HOCH2P(O)(OEt)(O-resin), or H2NCH2P(O)(OEtXO-resin) can lead to libraries of compounds of formula I wherein X is a -NHC(OX)CH2-, or a -NHC(O)NHCH2-.<br>
For compounds of formula V wherein X is an alkyl group, the phosphonate group can be introduced using other common phosphonate formation methods such as Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction (Bhattacharya et al., Chem. Rev., 1981, 81: 415), Michaelis-Becker reaction (Blackburn et al., J. Organomet. Chem., 1988, 348: 55), and addition reactions of phosphorus to electrophiles (such as aldehydes, ketones, acyl halides, imines and other carbonyl derivatives).<br><br>
Phosphonate component can also be introduced via lithiation reactions. For example, lithiation of an 2-ethynylpyridine using a suitable base followed by trapping the thus generated anion with a dialkyl chlorophosphonate lead to compounds of formula 3 wherein R5 is a pyridyl, X is a 1-(2-phosphono)ethynyl group.<br>
(5) Construction of a heterocvcle<br>
Although existing heterocycles are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V, when required, heterocycles can also be constructed leading to compounds in the current invention, and in some cases may be preferred for the preparations of certain compounds. The construction of heterocycles have been well described in the literature using a variety of reaction conditions (Joule et al.. Heterocyclic Chemistry; Chapman hall, London, 1995; Boger, Weinreb, Hetero Diels-Alder Methodology In Organic Synthesis; Academic press, San Diego, 1987; Padwa, 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Chemistry, Wiley, New York, 1984; Katritzsky et al., Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry; Pergamon press, Oxford; Newkome et al., Contemporary Heterocyclic Chemistry: Syntheses, Reaction and Applications; Wiley, New York, 1982; Syntheses of Heterocyclic Compounds; Consultants Bureau, New York). Some of the methods which are useful to prepare compounds in the present invention are given as examples in the following discussion.<br>
(ft Construction of a thiazoie ring system<br>
Thiazoies useful for the present invention can be readily prepared using a variety of well described ring-forming reactions (Metzger, Thiazoie and its derivatives, part 1 and part 2; Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979). Cyclization reactions of thioamides (e.g. thioacetamide, thiourea) and alpha-haiocarbonyl compounds (such as alpha-haloketones, alpha-haloaldehydes) are particularly useful for the construction of a thiazoie ring system. For example, cyclization reactions between thiourea and 5-diethylphosphono-2-[(-2-bromo-l-oxo)alkyl]furans are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula 2 wherein Rs is a thiazoie, A is an amino group and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group; cyclization reaction between thiourea and a bromopyruvate alkyl ester give a 2-amino-4-alkoxycarbonylthiazole which is useful for the preparations of compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is a thiazoie and X is an alkylaminocarbonyl, an alkoxycarbonyl, an alkylaminocarbonylamino, or an alkoxyacarbonylamino group. Thioamides can be prepared using reactions reported in the literature (Trost, Comprehensive organic synthesis, yol. 6,; Pergamon press, New York, 1991, pages 419 - 434) and alpha-halocarbonyl compounds are readily accessible via conventional reactions (Larock, Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). For example, amides<br><br>
can be converted to thioamides using Lawesson's reagent or P,S5, and ketones can be halogenated using various halogenating reagents (e.g. NBS, CuBr,).<br>
fti) Construction of an oxazole ring system<br>
Oxazoles useful for the present invention can be prepared using various methods in the literature (Turehi, Oxazoles; Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1986). Reactions between isocyanides (e.g. tosylmethylisocyanide) and carbonyi compounds (e.g. aldehydes and acyl chlorides) can be used to construct oxazole ring systems (van Leusen et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1972, 2369). Alternatively, cyclization reactions of amides (e.g. urea, carboxamides) and alpha-halocarbonyl compounds are commonly used for the construction of an oxazole ring system. For example, the reactions of urea and 5-diethylphosphono-2-[(-2-bromo-l-oxo)alkyl]fbrans are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is an oxazole, A is an amino group and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. Reactions between amines and imidates are also used to construct the oxazole ring system (Meyers et al, J. Org. Chem., 1986, 51(26), 5111).<br>
(iii) Construction of a pyridine ring system<br>
Pyridines useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula I can be prepared using various known synthetic methods (Klingsberg, Pyridine and Its Derivatives; Interscience Publishers, New York, 1960 - 1984). 1,5-Dicarbonyl compounds or their equivalents can be reacted with ammonia or compounds which can generate ammonia to produce 1,4-dihydropyridines which are easily dehydrogenated to pyridines. When unsaturated 1,5-dicarbonyl compounds, or their equivalents (e.g. pyrylium ions) are used to react with ammonia, pyridines can be generated directly. 1,5-Dicarbonyl compounds or their equivalents can be prepared using conventional chemistry. For example, 1,5-diketones are accessible via a number of routes, such as Michael addition of an enolate to an enone (or precursor Mannich base (Gill et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1952, 74, 4923)), ozonolysis of a cyclopcntene precursor, or reaction of silyl enol ethers with 3-methoxyallylic alcohols (Duhamel et al, Tetrahedron, 1986, 42,4,111). When one of the carbonyi carbons is at the acid oxidation state, then this type of reaction produces 2-pyridones which can be readily converted to 2-halopyridines (Isler et al, Helv. Chim. Acta, 1955, 38,1033) or 2-aminopyridines (Vorbruggen et al, Chem. Ber., 1984,117, 1523). Alternatively, a pyridine can be prepared from an aldehyde, a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound and ammonia via the classical Hantzsch synthesis (Bossart et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1981,20, 762). Reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds (or their equivalents) with 3-amino-enones or 3-amino-nitriles have also been used to produce pyridines (such as the Guareschi synthesis, Mariella, Org. Synth.. Coll. Vol. IV, 1963,210). 1,3-Dicarbonyl<br><br>
compounds can be made via oxidation reactions on corresponding 1,3-diols or aldol reaction products (Mukaiyama, Org, Reactions, 1982, 28, 203). Cycloaddition reactions have also been used for the synthesis of pyridines, for example cycloaddition reactions between oxazoles and alkenes (Naito et at., Cftem. Pharm. Bull., 1965,13, 869), and Diels-Alder reactions between 1,2,4-triazines and enamines (Boger et al., J. Org. Chem., 1981, 46, 2179).<br>
(iv) Construction of a pyrimidine ring system<br>
Pyrimidine ring systems usefut for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-2 are readily available (Brown, The pyrimidines; Wiley, New York, 1994). One method for pyrimidine synthesis involves the coupling of a 1,3-diearbonyI component (or its equivalent) with an N-C-N fragment. The selection of the N-C-N component - urea (Sherman et al., Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. IV, 1963,247), amidine (Kenner et al., J. Chem. Soc, 1943, 125) or guanidine (Burgess, J. Org. Chem., 1956, 21, 97; VanAllan, Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. IV, 1963, 245) - governs the substitution at C-2 in the pyrimidine products. This method is particular useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-2 with various A groups. In another method, pyrimidines can be prepared via cycloaddition reactions such as aza-Diels-Alder reactions between a 1,3,5-triazine and an enamine or an ynamine (Boger et al., Jl Org. Chem., 1992, 57,4331 and references cited therein).<br>
(v) Construction of an imidazole ring system<br>
Imidazoles useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-1 are readily prepared using a variety of different synthetic methodologies. Various cyclization reactions are generally used to synthesize imidazoles such as reactions between amidines and alpha-haloketones (Mallick et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1984,106(23), 7252) or alpha-hydroxyketones (Shi et al, Synthetic Comm., 1993,23(18), 2623), reactions between urea and alpha-haloketones, and reactions between aldehydes and 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds in the presence of amines.<br>
(vi) Construction of an isoxazole ring system<br>
Isoxazoles useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-l are readily synthesized using various methodologies (such as cycloaddition reactions between nitrile oxides and alkynes or active methylene compounds, oximation of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds or alpha, beta-acetylenic carbonyl compounds or alpha,beta-dihalocarbonyl compounds, etc.) can be used to synthesize an isoxazole ring system (Grunanger et al., Isoxazoles; Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991). For example, reactions between alkynes and 5-diethylphosphono-2-chlorooximidofuran in the presence of base (e.g. triethylamine,<br><br>
Hunig's base, pyridine) are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is an isoxazole and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group.<br>
(vii) Construction of a pvrazole ring system<br>
Pyrazoles useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-l are readily prepared using a variety of methods (Wiley, Pyrazoles, Pyrazolines, Pyrazolidines, Indazoles, and Condensed Rings; Interscience Publishers, New York, 1967) such as reactions between hydrazines and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds or 1,3-diearbonyl equivalents (e.g. one of the earbony! group is masked as an enamine or ketal or acetal), and additions of hydrazines to acrylonitriles followed by cyclization reactions (Dom et al, Org. Synth,, 1973, Coll. Vol: V, 39). Reaction of 2-(2-alkyl-3-N,N-dimethylamino)acryloyl-5-diethylphosphonofurans with hydrazines are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula I wherein R5 is a pyrazole, X is a furan-2,5-diyl group and B" is an alkyl group.<br>
(viii) Construction of a 1,2.4-triazole ring system<br>
1,2,4-Triazoles useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula V-l are readily available via various methodologies (Montgomery, 1,2,4-Triazoles; Wiley, New York, 1981). For example, reactions between hydrazides and imidates or thioimidates (Sui et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett, 1998, 8, 1929; Catarzi et al, 7. Med. Chem., 1995,38(2), 2196), reactions between 1,3,5 triazine and hydrazines (Grundmann et al, J. Org. Chem., 1956, 21,1037), and reactions between aminoguanidine and carboxylic esters (Ried et al, Chem. Ber., 1968, J 01,2117) are used to synthesize 1,2,4-triazoles.<br>
(6) Ring closure to construct a heterocvele with a phosphonate<br>
Compounds of formula 4 can also be prepared using a ring closure reaction to construct the heterocycle from precursors that contain the phosphonate component For example, cyclization reactions between thiourea and 5-diethyhosphono-2-[(-2-bromo-l-oxo)alkyl]furans are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula 2 wherein Rs is a thiazole, A is an amino group and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. Oxazoles of the present invention can also be prepared using a ring closure reaction. In this case, reactions of urea and 5-diemylphosphono-2-[(-2-bromo-l-oxo)alkyl]furans are useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula I wherein R5 is an oxazole, A is an amino group and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. Reactions between 5-diethyiphosphono-2-furaldehyde, an alkyl amine, a 1,2-diketone and ammonium acetate are useful to synthesize compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is an imidazole and X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. These types of ring closure reactions can also be used for the synthesis of pyridines or pyrimidines useful in the<br><br>
present invention. For example, reaction of 5-diethylphosphono-2-[3-dimethylamino-2-alkyl)acryloyl]furans and cyanoacetamide in the presence of base gives 5-alkyl-3-cyano-6-[2-(5-diethylphosphono)furanyl]-2-pyridones (Jain et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3307). Subsequent conversion of these 2-pyridones to the corresponding 2-halopyridines (see references cited in section 3 for the modifications of heterocycles) will lead to compounds of formula I wherein R5 is a pyridine, A is a halo group, X is a furan-2,5-diyl group, and B is an alkyl group. Reactions of 5-diethylphosphono-2-[3-dimethylamino-2-alkyl)acryloyl]furans and amidines in the presence of base give 5-alkyl-6-[2-(5-diethylphosphono)-furanyl]pyrimidines which will lead to compounds of formula 2 wherein R5 is a pyrimidine, X is a furan-2,5-diyl group and B is an alkyl group.<br>
(7) Preparation of various precursors useful for cvclization reactions<br>
Intermediates required for the synthesis of compounds in the present invention are generally prepared using either an existing method in the literature or a modification of an existing method. Syntheses of some of the intermediates useful for the synthesis of compounds in the present invention are described herein.<br>
Various aryl phosphonate dialkyl esters are particularly useful for the synthesis of compounds of formula I. For example, compounds of formula 3 wherein X is a furan-2,5-diyl group can be prepared from a variety of furanyl precursors. It is envisioned that synthesis of other precursors may follow some or all of these reaction steps, and some modifications of these reactions may be required for different precursors. 5-Dialkylphosphono-2-furancarbonyl compounds (e.g. 5-diethylphosphono-2-furaldehyde, S-diethylphosphono-2-acetylfuran) are well suited for the synthesis of compounds of formula I wherein X is a furan-2,5-diyl group. These intermediates are prepared from furan or furan derivatives using conventional chemistry such as lithiation reactions, protection of carbonyl groups and deprotection of carbonyl groups. For example, lithiation of furan using known methods (Gschwend Org. React. 1979,26: 1) followed by addition of phosphorytating agents (e.g. CIPO3R2) gives 2-dialkylphosphono-furans (e.g. 2-diethylphosphonofuran). This method can also be applied to a^-substituted furan (e.g. 2-furoic acid) to give a 5-dialkylphosphono-2-substituted furan (e.g. 5-diethyIphosphono-2-furoic acid). It is envisioned that other aryl phosphonate esters can also be prepared using this approach or a modification of this approach. Alternatively, other methods such as transition metal catalyzed reactions of aryl halides or triflates (Balthazar et al. J. Org. Chem.. 1980, 45: 5425; Petrakis et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1987,109: 2831; Lu et al. Synthesis, 1987, 726) are used to prepare aryl phosphonates. Aryl phosphonate esters can also be prepared from aryl phosphates under anionic rearrangement conditions (Melvin, Tetrahedron Lett., 1981, 22: 3375; Casteel et al. Synthesis, 1991, 691). N-Alkoxy aryl<br><br>
salts with alkali metal derivatives of dialkyl phosphonate provide another general synthesis for heteroary!-2-phosphonate esters (Redmore./. Org. Chem., 1970,35: 4114).<br>
A second lithiation step can be used to incorporate a second group on the aryl phosphonate dialkyl ester such as an aldehyde group, a trialkylstannyl or a halo group, although other methods known to generate these functionalities (e.g. aldehydes) can be envisioned as well (e.g. Vilsmeier-Haek reaction or Reimar-Teimann reaction for aldehyde synthesis). In the second lithiation step, the lithiated aromatic ring is treated with reagents that either directly generate the desired functional group (e.g. for an aldehyde using DMF, HC02R, etc.) or with reagents that lead to a group that is subsequently transformed into the desired functional group using known chemistry (e.g. alcohols, esters, nitrites, alkenes can be transformed into aldehydes). For example, lithiation of a 2-dialkylphosphonofuran (e.g. 2-diethylphosphonofuran) under normal conditions (e.g. LDA in THF) followed by trapping of the thus generated anion with an electrophile (e.g. tributyltin chloride or iodine) produces a 5-functionaIized-2-dialkylphosphonofuran (e.g. 5-tributylstannyl-2-diethylphosphonofuran or 5-iodo-2-diethylphosphonofuran). It is also envisioned that the sequence of these reactions can be reversed, i.e. the aldehyde moiety can be incorporated first followed by the phosphorylation reaction. The order of the reaction will be dependent on reaction conditions and protecting groups. Prior to the phosphorylation, it is also envisioned that it maybe advantageous to protect some of these functional groups using a number of well-known methods (e.g. protection of aldehydes as acetals, aminals; protection of ketones as ketals). The protected functional group is then unmasked after phosphorylation. (Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., 1991, Wiley, New York). For example, protection of 2-furaldehyde as 1,3-propanediol acetal followed by a lithiation step (using for example LDA) and trapping the anion with a dialkyl chlorophosphate (e.g. diethyl chlorophosphate), and subsequent deprotection of the acetal functionality under normal deprotection conditions produces the 5-dialkylphosphono-2-furaldehyde (e.g. 5-diethylphosphono-2-furaldehyde). Another example is the preparation of 5-keto-2-dialkylphosphonofurans which encompass the following steps: acylations of furan under Friedel-Crafts reaction conditions give 2-ketofuran, subsequent protection of the ketone as ketals (e.g. 1,3-propanediol cyclic ketal) followed by a lithiation step as described above gives the 5-dialkylpho'sphono-2-furanketone with the ketone being protected as a 1,3-propanediol cyclic ketal, and final deprotection of the ketal under, for example, acidic conditions gives 2-keto-5-dialkylphosphonofurans (e.g. 2-acetyl-5-diethylphosphonofuran). Alternatively, 2-ketofurans can be synthesized via a palladium catalyzed reaction between 2-trialkylstannylfurans (e.g. 2-tributylstannylfuran) and an acyl chloride (e.g. acetyl chloride, isobutyryl chloride). It is advantageous to have the phosphonate moiety present<br><br>
in the 2-trialkylstannylfurans (e.g. 2-tributylstannyl-5-diethylphosphonoftiran). 2-Keto-5-dialkylphosphonofurans can also be prepared from a 5-dialkylphosphono-2-furoic acid (e.g. 5-diethylphosphono-2-furoic acid) by conversion of the acid to the corresponding acyl chloride and followed by additions of a Grignard reagent.<br>
Some of the above described intermediates can also be used for the synthesis of other useful intermediates. For example, a 2-keto-S-dialkylphosphonofuran can be further converted to a 1,3-diearbonyl derivative which is useful for the preparation of pyrazoles, pyridines or pyrimidines. Reaction of a 2-keto-5-dialkylphosphonofuran (e.g. 2-acetyl-5-diethylphosphonofuran) with a dialkylformamide dialkyl acetal (e.g. dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal) gives a 1,3-diearbonyl equivalent as a 2-(3-dialkylamino-2-alkyI-acryloyl)-5-diaIkylphosphonofuran(e.g. 2-(3-dimethylaminoacryloyl)-5-diethylphosphonofuran).<br>
It is envisioned that the above described methods for the synthesis of furan derivatives can be either directly or with some modifications applied to syntheses of various other useful intermediates such as aryl phosphonate esters (e.g. thienyl phosphonate esters, phenyl phosphonate esters or pyridyi phosphonate esters).<br>
It is conceivable that when applicable the above described synthetic methods can be adopted for parallel synthesis either on solid phase or in solution to provide rapid SAR (structure activity relationship) exploration of FBPase inhibitors encompassed in the current invention, provided method development for these reactions are successful.<br>
Section 2.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds of Formula X<br>
Synthesis of the compounds encompassed by the present invention typically includes some or all of the following general steps: (1) preparation of a phosphonate prodrug ; (2) deprotection of a phosphonate ester; (3) construction of a heterocycle; (4) introduction of a phosphonate component; (5) synthesis of an aniline derivative. Step (1) and step (2) were discussed in section 1, and discussions of step (3), step (4) and step (5) are given below. These methods are also generally applicable'to compounds of Formula X.<br><br><br>
(3) Construction of a heterocycle (i) Benzothiazole ring system<br>
Compounds of formula 3 wherein G=S, i.e. benzothiazoles, can be prepared using various synthetic methods reported in the literature. Two of these methods are given as examples as discussed below. One method is the modification of commercially available benzothiazole derivatives to give the appropriate functionality on the benzothiazole ring. Another method is the annulation of various anilines (e.g. compounds of formula 4) to construct the thiazole portion of the benzothiazole ring. For example, compounds of formula 3 wherein G"=S, A=NH2, L2,E2,J2=H, X2=CH20, and R'=Et can be prepared from the commercially available 4-methoxy-2-amino thiazole via a two-step sequence:<br><br>
conversion 4-methoxy-2-aminobenzothiazole to 4-hydroxy-2-aminobenzothiazole with reagents such as BBrj (Node, M.; et al J. Org. Chem. 45, 2243-2246, 1980) or MCl3 in presence of a thiol (e.g. EtSH) (McOmie, J. F. W.; et al. Org. Synth.. Collect. Vol. V, 412,1973) followed alkylation of the phenol group with diethylphosphonomethyl trifiuoromethylsulfonate (Phillion, D. P.; et at. Tetrahedron Lett. 27, 1477-1484,1986) in presence of a suitable base (e.g. NaH) in polar aprotic solvents (e.g. DMF) provide the required compound.<br>
Several methods can be used to convert various anilines to benzothiazoles (Sprague, J. M.; Land, A. H. Heterocycle. Compd. 5, 506-13,1957). For example, 2-aminobezothiazoles (formula 3 wherein A=NH2) can be prepared by annulation of compounds of formula 4 wherein W2=H, using various common methods. One method involves the treatment of a suitably substituted aniline with a mixture of K.SCN and CuS04 in methanol to give a substituted 2-aminobezothiazole (Ismail, I. A.; Sharp, D. E; Chedekel, M. R. J. Org. Chem. 45, 2243-2246,1980). Alternatively, a 2-aminobenzothiazolc can also be prepared by the treatment of Br2 in presence of KSCN in acetic acid (Patil, D. G.; Chedekel, M. R. J. Org. Chem. 49, 997-1000,1984). This reaction can also be done in two step sequence. For example treatment of substituted phenylthioureas with Br2 in CHCl3 gives substituted 2-aminob'enzothiazoles (Patil, D. G.; Chedekel, M. R. J. Org. Chem. 49,997-1000, 1984). 2-Aminobenzothiazoles can also be made by condensation ortho iodo anilines with thiourea in presence of Ni catalyst (NiCl2 (PPh3)2) (Takagi, K.Chem. Lett. 265-266,1986).<br>
Benzothiazoles can undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution to give 6-substituted benzothiazoles (Sprague, J. M.; Land, A. H. Heterocycle. Compd. 5,606-13, 1957). For example bromination of formula 3 wherein G"=S, A=SNH2, L3,E3,J2=H, X2=CH20 and R'=Et with bromine in polar solvents such as AcOH gave compound of formula 3 wherein E2=Br.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of formula 3 wherein A is a halo, H, alkoxy, alkylthio or an alkyl can be prepared from the corresponding amino compound (Larock, Comprehensive organic transformations, VCH, New York, 1989; Trost, Comprehensive organic synthesis; Pergamon press, New York, 1991).<br><br>
(ii) Benzoxazoles<br>
Compounds of formula 3 wherein G=0, i.e. benzoxazoles, can be prepared by the annulation ortho aminophenols with suitable reagent (e.g. cyanogen halide (A=NH2; Alt, K. O.; et al V. Heterocyclic Chem. 12, 775,1975) or acetic acid (A=CH3; Saa, J. M.; J. Org.Chem. 57, 589-594, 1992) or trialkyl orthoformate (A=H; Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 22, 613,1990)).<br>
(4) Introduction of a Phosphonate Component<br>
Compounds of formula 4 (wherein X2=CH20 and R'=alkyl) can made in different ways (e.g. using alkylation and nucleophilic substitution reactions). Typically, compounds of formula 5 wherein M'=OH is treated with a suitable base (e.g. NaH) in polar aprotic " solvent (e.g. DMF, DMSO) and the resulting phenoxide anion can be alkylated with a suitable electrophile preferably with a phosphonate component present (e.g. diethyl iodomethylphosphonate, diethyl trifluoromethylsulphonomethyl phosphonate, diethyl p-methyltoluenesulphonomethylphosphonate). The alkylation method can also be applied to the precursor compounds to compounds of formula 5 wherein a phenol moiety is present and it can be alkylated with a phosphonate containing component. Alternately, compounds of formula 4 can also be made from the nucleophilic substitution of the precursor compounds to compounds of formula 5 (wherein a halo group, preferably a fluoro or a chloro, is present ortho to a nitro group). For example, a compound of formula 4 (wherein X2=CH20 and R'=Et) can be prepared from a 2-chloro-l-nitrobenzene derivative by treatment with NaOCH2P(O)(OEt)2 in DMF. Similarly, compounds of formula 4 where X2= -alkyl-S- or -alkyl-N- can also be made.<br>
(5) Synthesis of an aniline derivative<br>
Numerous synthetic methods have been reported for the synthesis of aniline derivatives, these methods can be applied to the synthesis of useful intermediates which can lead to compounds of formula X. For example, various alkenyl or aryl groups can be introduced on to a benzene ring via transition metal catalyzed reactions (Kasibhatla, S. R., et al. WO 98/39343 and the references cited in); anilines can be prepared from their corresponding nitro derivatives via reduction reactions (e.g. hydrogenation reactions in presence of 10 % PdVC, or reduction reactions using SnCh in HC1 (Patil, D. G.; Chedekel, M. R. J. Org. Chem. 49, 997-1000, 1984)).<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples may be useful for identifying compounds which 1) inhibit FBPase and gluconeogenesis in cellular and animal models of diabetes; or 2) enhance insulin sensitivity in cell culture or animal models of diabetes; or 3) exhibit superior pharmacological activity as combinations of FBPase inhibitors and insulin sensitizers relative to either agent alone.<br>

Example A: Inhibition of Human Liver FBPase<br>
E. coli strain BL21 transformed with a human liver FBPase-encoding plasmid was obtained from Dr. M. R. El-Maghrabi at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. hlFBPase was typically purified from 10 liters of E, coli culture as described by M. Gidh-Jain et ai. J. Biol Chem. 269,27732-27738 (1994). Enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically in reactions that coupled the formation of product (fructose 6-phosphate) to the reduction of dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) via NADP and phenazine methosulfate (PMS), using phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase as the coupling enzymes. Reaction mixtures (200 l) were made up in 96-well microtitre plates, and consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,100 mM KCI, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2,0.2 mM NADP, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM MTT, 0.6 mM PMS, 1 unit/ml phosphoglucose isomerase, 2 units/ml glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.150 mM substrate (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate). Inhibitor concentrations were varied from 0.01 uM to 10 uM. Reactions were started by the addition of 0.002 units of pure hlFBPase and were monitored for 7 minutes at 590 nm in a Molecular Devices Plate Reader (37°C).<br>
The potencies of select compounds against human liver FBPase are shown in the<br>
table below:<br><br>
Example B: Inhibition of rat liver and mouse liver FBPase<br>
E. coli strain BL21 transformed with a rat liver FBPase-encoding plasmid was obtained from Dr. M. R. El-Maghrabi at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and<br><br>
purified as described (El-Maghrabi, M.R., and Pilkis, S.J. (1991) Biochem. Biophvs. Res. Commun. 176: 137-144). Mouse liver FBPase was obtained by homogenizing freshly isolated mouse liver in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation, and the 45-75% ammonium sulfate fraction prepared. This fraction was redissolved in the homogenization buffer and desalted on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Biorad) eluted with same. This partially purified fraction was used for enzyme assays. Both rat liver and mouse liver FBPase were assayed as described for human liver FBPase in Example A. Generally, as reflected by higher IC50 values, the rat and mouse liver enzymes are less sensitive to inhibition by the compounds tested than the human liver enzyme.<br>
The following Table depicts the IC50 values for several compounds prepared in the Examples:<br>

Example C: Inhibition of Gluconeogenesis in Rat Hepatocytes<br>
. Hepatocytes were prepared from fed Sprague-Dawley rats (25O-300 g) according to the procedure of Berry and Friend (Berry, M.N., Friend, D.S., 1969, J. Cell. Biol. 43, 506-520) as modified by Groen (Groen, A.K., Sips, H.J., Vervoom, R.C., Tager, J.M., 1982, Eur. J. Biochem. 122, 87-93). Hepatocytes (75 mg wet weight/ml) were incubated in 1 ml Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mM Lactate, 1 mM pyruvate, 1 mg/ml BSA, and<br><br>
test compound concentrations from 0 to 500 uM. Incubations were carried out in a 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere in closed, 5O-ml Falcon tubes submerged in a rapidly shaking water bath (37°C). After 1 hour, an aliquot (0.25 ml) was removed, transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged. 50 ul of supernatant was then assayed for glucose content using a Sigma Glucose Oxidase kit as per the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The following Table depicts the IC50 values for several compounds prepared in the Examples:<br>

Troglitazone	&gt;100<br>
FBPase from rat liver is less sensitive to AMP than that from human liver. IC50 values are consequently higher in rat hepatocytes than would be expected in human hepatocytes.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to screen compounds of formula I on hepatocytes such as described in Examples C and D because these compounds are phosphorylated by the hepatocytes and thereby become FBPase inhibitors.<br>
Example D: Inhibition of Glucose Production and Elevation of Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate Levels in Rat Hepatocytes Treated with FBPase Inhibitors.<br>
Rat hepatocytes were isolated and incubated as described in Example C. Cell extracts, were analyzed for glucose content as described in Example C, and also for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was assayed spectrophotometrically by coupling its enzymatic conversion to glycerol 3-phosphate to the oxidation of NADH,<br><br>
which was monitored at 340 nm. Reaction mixtures (1 ml) consisted of 200 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.3 mM NADH, 2 units/ml glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2 units/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and 5O-100 ul cell extract. After a 30 minute preincubation at 37°C, I unit/ml of aldolase was added and the change in absorbance measured until a stable value was obtained. 2 moles of NADH are oxidized in this reaction per mole of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate present in the cell extract.<br>
Compound A and Compound E inhibited glucose production in a dose-dependent manner with IC50's of 50 and 2.5 uM, respectively. Consistent with the inhibition of FBPase, dose-dependent elevation of intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was observed with both compounds.<br>
Example E: Analysis of Hepatic and Plasma Drug Metabolite* Levels, Blood Glucose, and Hepatic Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate Levels After Administration of Compound A p.o. to Normal Fasted Rats.<br>
Compound A was administered by oral gavage to freely-feeding SpragueDawley rats (25O-300g). The compound was prepared as a suspension in carboxymethylcellulose, and administered at a dose of 250 mg/kg. For die determination of liver metabolites, rats were serially sacrificed over the course of 24 hours after drug administration. Livers were freeze-clamped, homogenized in perchloric acid, neutralized, and then analyzed for Compound B by anion exchange HPLC.<br>
For the determination of plasma metabolites, rats were instrumented with carotid catheters prior to oral dosing. Blood samples were withdrawn via the catheters at appropriate time points over the course of 8 hours post drug administration. Plasma was prepared from the blood samples by centrifugation, and plasma protein precipitated by the addition of methanol to 60%. Compound A metabolites were quantitated by reverse phase HPLC in the deproteinated plasma samples. A CI8 column (1:4 cm X 250 mm) was equilibrated with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.5 and eluted with a gradient from this buffer to acetonitrile. Detection was at 254 nm.<br>
The effect of Compound A on block! glucose and hepatic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels was determined ia 18-hour fasted Sprague-Dawley rats (25O-300 g). Animals were dosed as described above. At appropriate time points post drug administration, rats were anesthetized with halothane and a liver biopsy (approx. 1 g) was taken, as well as a blood sample (2 ml) from the posterior vena cava. A heparin flushed syringe and needle was used for blood collection. The liver sample was immediately homogenized in ice-cold<br><br>
10% perchloric acid (3 ml), centrifuged, and the supernatant neutralized with l/3rd volume of 3 M KOH/3 M KH2CO3. Following centrifugation and filtration,the neutralized extract was analyzed for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate content as decribed for isolated hepatocytes in Example C. Blood glucose was measured by means of a Hemocue analyzer (Hemocue Inc, Mission Viejo, CA).<br>
Analysis of liver metabolites revealed that Compound A was efficiently converted to Compound B, with intrahepatic levels of the latter reaching 3 umoles/g tissue within 1 hour. Although levels declined slowly over time, Compound B was measurable out to the final, 24 hour time point. In plasma 5-bromo-l-pD-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-carboxamide but not Compound A was detectable, suggesting that Compound A was rapidly deacetylated at all three positions. -<br>
The single 250 mg/kg dose of Compound A markedly lowered blood glucose for approximately 8 hours, at which time levels in the treated animals rebounded slowly to those of the vehicle-treated controls. Drug treatment resulted in the elevation of hepatic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. The time course of elevation of this gluconeogeneic intermediate correlated well with the time course of glucose lowering. Peak elevation was observed at near maximal glucose lowering, and as blood glucose levels rebounded, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels slowly returned to normal. The latter observations are consistent with the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by Compound A at the level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.<br>
Example F: Analysis of Hepatic and Plasma Drug Levels After Administration Compounds D and £ intraperitoneally to Normal Fasted Rats.<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (25O-300 g) were fasted for 18 hours and then dosed intraperitoneally either with saline or FBPase inhibitor. The vehicle used for drug administration was 10 mM bicarbonate. One hour post injection, rats were anesthetized with halothane, and liver and blood samples were taken and processed as described in Example E. The neutralized liver extracts were analyzed for FBPase inhibitor content by HPLC. A reverse phase YMC ODS AQ column (250 X 4.6 cm) was used and eluted with a gradient from 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 5.5 to 75% acetonitrile. Absorbance was monitored at 310 run. Glucose was measured in the blood sample as described in Example C. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation and extracted by addition of methanol to 60%<br><br>
(v/v). The methanolic extract was clarified by centrifugation and filtration and then analyzed by HPLC as described above.<br>
Results for select compounds prepared in the examples are shown in the table below.<br>

Example G: Oral Bioavailability Determination<br>
The oral bioavailability of prodrugs and parent compounds was determined by the urinary excretion method in the rat. Prodrugs were dissolved in 10% ethanol/90% polyethylene glycol (mw 400) and administered by oral gavage at doses of 10 to 40 mg/kg parent compound equivalents to 6-hour fasted, Sprague Dawley rats (22O-240 g). Parent compounds were typically dissolved in deionized water, neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and then administered orally at 1O-40 mg/kg or intravenously at -10 mg/kg. The rats were subsequently placed in metabolic cages and urine was collected for 24 hours. The quantity of parent compound excreted into urine was determined by HPLC analysis as described in Example F. Analysis was performed as described in Example F. For prodrugs, the percentage oral bioavailability was estimated by comparison of the recovery in urine of the parent compound generated from the prodrug administered orally, to that recovered in urine following intravenous administration of the corresponding parent compound. For parent compounds, the percentage oral bioavailability was estimated by comparison of the recovery in urine of the parent compound when administered orally to that recovered when administered intravenously.<br>
The estimated % oral bioavailability of select prodrugs and parent compounds is shown below.<br><br>

Example H: PPARy binding<br>
Human PPAR y g extracts, obtained from Sf9 insect cells expressing the cloned human gene incorporated into a baculovirus expression vector using procedures described in Mangelsdorf et al. Cell 54: 199-207 (1991), are used for saturation binding analysis. Extracts are incubated at 4 C for 3 h in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM KC1,10 mM dithiothreitol with [3H)-BRL-49653 in the presence or absence of the insulin sensitizer. Bound is separated from free radioactivity by elution through 1-mL Sephadex G-25 desalting columns. Bound radioactivity is eluted in the column void volume and is quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Insulin sensitizer treatment displaces [3H]-BRL-49653 from the PPARy receptor, and results in reduced recovery of radioactivity in the bound fraction. The tighter the affinity of the insulin sensitizer for the receptor, the more radioactivity is displaced.<br>
Example I: Adipocyte Binding<br>
Adipocytes are prepared from adipose tissue obtained from mammary gland by collagenase digestion (2 mg/ml collagenase; 4 ml/g tissue) by the method of Rodbell. Krebs-Henseleit medium is used (NaCl; 123 mM, NaHC03; 26 mM, KCl; 5 mM, MgS04; 1.2 mM, KH2P04; 1.25 mM, glucose 5.6 mM, pH 7.4) gassed with 95% OV5% CO2. The medium includes 4% BSA and is supplemented with p-aminoclonidine (100 nM) and adenosine (200 nM) to inhibit hpolysis. Binding studies are performed by rinsing the adipocytes in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium/Hams £-12 nutrient mix medium containing 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 200 nM adenosine. After three washes to remove collagenase and BSA, 0.5 ml of cells are added (in triplicate) tubes containing radtolabelled insulin sensitizer. Final concentration of insulin sensitizer in all incubations is 30 pM. Tubes are incubated at 37 C for 1 h in a shaking bath and cell-associated radioactivity is assessed by separation of cells from medium by centrifugation (200 ul of incubation medium, in duplicate) through silicone oil (Dow Corning 200/200<br><br>
cs) for 20 s at 10000 g in a Beckman microfuge. Cell pellets are counted for USI content after cutting the microfiige tube. Non-specific binding is estimated in the presence of 3 M RBL 49653. Affinity of the insulin sensitizer for adipocyte receptor is indicated by an increase in specific 125I content in the cell pellets.<br>
Example J: Triglyceride Formation by Differentiated Adipocytes<br>
The pre-adipocyte cell line, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, are obtained from ATCC. The cells are grown to confluence and differentiated with insulin, dexamethasone and IBMX. Adipocyte differentiation is observed by oil red O staining which stains the lipid droplets within the cytoplasm red. The extent of adipocyte differentiation is then monitored by microscope observation. Mature, lipid-filled adipocytes are used 8-10 days post-differentiation. Treatment of cells with insulin, a thiazolidinedione, or RXR ligands induces triglyceride accumulation.<br>
Example K: Glucose Uptake<br>
The pre-adipocyte cell line, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are grown to confluence and differentiated with insulin, dexamethasone and IBMX. Mature, lipid-filled adipocytes are used 8-10 days post-differentiation. Glucose transport is assessed after treatment of differentiated cells with insulin sensitizers for 48 h. Compounds are added freshly each day. 2-deoxyglucose transport is determined by addition of 1 uC of 25 uM 2-deoxy-D-[2,6-3H] glucose. After 10 minutes, cells are freed of tracer by extensive washing with ice-cold PBS and cell-associated radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting of alkali-solubilized extracts. Glucose uptake rates are normalized for protein content. Insulin sensitizer treatment increases the rate of glucose transport into the cells as indicated by higher levels of cell-associated radioactivity.<br>
Example L: Activation of PPARy/RXR Heterodimers<br>
CV-1 cells are co-transfected with plasmids containing the genes encoding PPARy, RXR, and a luciferase-based reporter plasmid containing one or more PPRE's. Cells are treated with a range of doses of ligand. A concentration-dependent increase in luciferase induction is observed with ligands of RXR or of PPARy.<br><br>
Example M: Insulin Sensitivity Measured by Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic Clamp Technique<br>
ZDF Diabetic rats are treated with vehicle or an insulin sensitizer for 7 or more days, and then instrumented with jugular and carotid catheters. After a recovery period, animals are fasted overnight, and a constant infusion of insulin is initiated. Blood glucose levels are maintained at baseline with a variable rate glucose infusion. Samples for plasma glucose are drawn every 10 minutes for the duration of the 4-hour protocol. Steady state glucose infusion rates are higher in the insulin-sensitizer treated group, indicating improved glucose disposal/insulin sensitivity.<br>
Example N: Combination Treatment With Troglitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), and With Troglitazone and a Prodrug of an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound J) in the ZDF rat - Effects on Blood Glucose<br>
The Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat is widely used as a model for human type 2 diabetes as the progression of the disease in these rodents is similar to that described for human patients (Clark and Palmer L982, Terrettaz and Jeanrenaud 1983). The mature ZDF rat not only displays obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and accelerated hepatic glucose production, but also develops some of the common macro- and microvascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes.<br>

The purpose of this study was to determine whether combination treatment with Troglitazone-Compound G or Troglitazone-Compound J results in improved glycemic control in the ZDF rat relative to either agent administered alone, and thus establish whether combination therapy will be of clinical benefit.<br>
(a) Troglitazone-Compound G Protocol: Male ZDF rats were purchased at 8 weeks of age from Genetics Models Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana). The rats were maintained under standard vivarium conditions (25°C, 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle) and received powdered Purina 5008 chow and water ad libitum. At 11 weeks of age, animals with blood glucose &gt;500 mg/dl were selected and divided into 4 treatment groups (n=8/group). The treatments were control, Troglitazone, Compound G, and the combination of Troglitazone and Compound G. Drugs were administered as 0.2% food admixtures for 15<br><br>
days. The dose of Troglitazone selected (0.2%) is a maximal dose, which in pilot studies was found to normalize blood glucose levels in 1O-week old ZDF rats. It is higher than the dose reported to prevent the onset of hyperglycemia in prediabetic ZDF rats (Sreenan et al 1996). In animals with established diabetes such as those selected for this study, the effects of Troglitazone better approximate those in man, where modest glucose lowering effects are generally observed (Inzucchi et al 1998). The dose of Compound G selected (0.2%) is also a maximal dose; a pilot study in the ZDF rat revealed that higher doses were of no additional benefit (blood glucose lowering at 0.5% was equivalent to that at 0.2%). Blood glucose levels were measured in tail vein samples by means of a HemoCue glucose analyzer (HemoCue Inc., Mission Viejo, CA). Values are expressed as the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean. Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Results are considered significant with p
(b) Troglitazone-Compound J Protocol: This study was carried out exactly as described in the Troglitazone-Compound G section above with two modifications: the treatment period was 21 days and the dose of Compound J used was 0.4%. In a pilot study, Compound J showed a trend (not significant) towards more pronounced blood glucose lowering at 0.4% than at 0.2%. The 0.4% dose was therefore chosen to ensure a maximal drug response.<br>
Combination treatment with Troglitazone and Compound G resulted in significantly greater reductions in blood glucose levels than treatment with either agent alone (see table below). At the end of the treatment period, blood glucose levels in the combination group (~200 mg/dl) approximated those of normal fed rats (-150 mg/dl).<br><br><br><br>
The data suggest that the combination of an insulin sensitizer (Troglitazone) and an FBPase inhibitor (Compound G) or a prodrug of an FBPase inhibitor (Compound J) may provide better glyeemic control than either agent alone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.<br>
Example €&gt;: Combination Treatment With Troglitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), and With Troglitazone and a Prodrug of an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound J) in the ZDF rat - Effects on Piasma Triglycerides<br>
Troglitazone treatment is known to reduce circulating triglycerides both in animal models of diabetes and in man. Triglyceride lowering is generally regarded as beneficial in Type 2 diabetics as these patients often suffer from hypertriglyceridemia and are at risk of the associated cardiovascular complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of combination treatment on plasma triglycerides.<br>
On the final day of treatment in the study described in Example N, blood samples were taken from the posterior vena cava of each rat while under halothane anesthesia. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation and triglyceride levels then measured by means of a standard assay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma Chemical Company). Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Results are considered significant with p
As illustrated in the tables below, troglitazone treatment had the expected effect of significantly reducing plasma triglyceride levels. In contrast, treatment with Compound G or Compound J resulted in an approximate 2-fold elevation of plasma triglycerides.<br><br>
Surprisingly, combination treatment resulted in the same degree of triglyceride lowering as treatment with Troglitazone alone, (a) Trogtitazone-Compound.G<br><br>
This study indicates that the beneficial triglycride lowering effects of Troglitazone are maintained in combination with Compound G or Compound J. Remarkably, the increase in triglycerides elicited by FBPase inhibitor monotherapy was suppressed in combination with the insulin sensitizer.<br><br>
Example P: Combination Treatment With Troglitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), and With Troglitazone and a Prodrug of an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound J) in the ZDF rat - Effects on Plasma Insulin<br>
Severe type 2 diabetes in man is often associated with the deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function and eventually the inability of the pancreas to secrete the amount of insulin appropriate for the degree of hyperglycemia. This progression is also evident in the ZDF rat. Animals initially go through a hyperinsulinemic phase to compensate for elevated blood glucose levels but eventually overstimulation of the pancreas results in diminished insulin secretion and hypoinsulinemia can ensue (Pickavance L et al 1998). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the improved glycemie control afforded by combination treatment with an insulin sensitizer and an FBPase inhibitor can attenuate the deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function.<br>
On the final day of treatment in the study described in Example N, blood samples were taken from the posterior vena cava of each rat while under halothane anesthesia. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation and insulin levels then measured by means of an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Life Sciences). Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Results are considered significant with p
There was no significant difference in plasma insulin levels between control rats and those on either Troglitazone or Compound G monotherapy (see tables below). Combination treatment, however, resulted in a significant increase in plasma insulin levels relative to all other groups, and in fact restored them to levels similar to those observed in non diabetes prone, lean ZDF rats (Pickavance et al 1998).<br><br><br>
The data show that combination treatment synergistically improves pancreatic endocrine function; insulin levels were increased significantly over those in controls only in the combination therapy group. This increase in plasma insulin could potentially be due to a reversal of lipotoxicity (Unger, 1997) and glucotoxicity (Leahy, 1990) in pancreatic islet cells. Attenuation of lipotoxicity may result from the triglyceride lowering effects of Troglitazone (Example O), while the attenuation of glucotoxicity may result from the combined glucose lowering effects of Trolitazone and Compound G (Example N).<br>
Example Q: Combination Treatment With Troglitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), and With Troglitazone and a Prodrug of an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound J) in the ZDF rat - Effects on Blood Lactate<br>
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of combination treatment on blood lactate levels.<br>
Blood samples were taken from the tail vein on days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 of the Troglitazone-Compound G combination study and on days 0,7,14, and 21 of the Troglitazone-Compound J combination study (study protocols are described in Example N). Following their acidification with perchloric acid and clarification by centrifugation, lactate was measured by means of a standard kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma Chemical Company).<br>
Baseline blood lactate levels for the Compound G and Compound J monotherapy groups were 1.98±0.17 mM and 2.24±0.08 mM, respectively. The maximal blood lactate elevations over baseline observed during the course of the studies were 2.5-fold for Compound G monotherapy and 3-fold for Compound J monotherapy. Blood lactate was typically elevated 2-fold over baseline in these groups. Blood lactate was not elevated above baseline (-2 mM) in the control or combination groups on any of the measurement days.<br>
Combination treatment with Troglitazone suppressed the blood lactate elevations observed in the FBPase inhibitor or FBPase inhibitor prodrug monotherapy groups. Combination treatment may thus have the unexpected benefit of improving the safety profile of FBPase inhibitors and their prodrugs.<br><br>
Example R: Combination Treatment With Rosigiitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), in the ZDF rat - Effects on Blood Glucose<br>
This study addressed whether combination treatment with Rosigiitazone and Compound G results in improved glycemic control in the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat relative to either agent administered alone.<br>
The protocol for this study was identical to the one described for the Troglitazone-Compound G combination in Example N with the following changes: (a) rats with blood glucose levels &gt;600 mg/dl were included in the study, (b) the dose of Rosigiitazone used was 0.0045% based on a literature report that this dose prevented the onset of diabetes in the ZDF rat (Smith et al 1997), and (c) the length of the study was 25 days.<br>
Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in all treatment groups relative to the control group. Blood glucose lowering in the combination group tended to be more pronounced but was not significantly different than that in the Rosigiitazone or Compound G monotherapy groups. As illustrated in the table below, the response to Rosigiitazone was highly variable and was likely a factor in the less than expected efficacy of combination treatment. However, there was a clear benefit of adding Compound G treatment on top of Rosigiitazone treatment; whereas only 6 out of 10 rats responded to therapy in the Rosigiitazone monotherapy group, 10 out of 10 rats responded in the combination group.<br><br>
aRats whose blood glucose levels were lower on day 25 than on day 0 *p 
The variable response to Rosigiitazone observed in the ZDF rat in this study has also been encountered in the clinic where reductions in fasting plasma glucose observed have ranged from less than 45 mg/dr&gt;{60% of patients) to greater than 140 mg/dl (25% of<br><br>
patients) (Patei et al 1999). Based on the trend towards improved glycemic control as well as the higher response rate of rats in the combination versus other treatment groups, this study suggests that co-treatment with an FBPase inhibitor could benefit patients on Rosigtitazone monotherapy.<br>
Example S: Combination Treatment With Troglitazone and an FBPase Inhibitor (Compound G), in the db/db Mouse - Effects on Blood Glucose<br>
The db/db mouse, like the ZDF rat, is a standard model of type 2 diabetes which displays many of the characteristics of human diabetes, including obesity, increased hepatic glucose output, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (Coleman and Hummel 1967). The purpose of this study was to determine whether combination treatment with an insulin sensitizer (Troglitazone) and an FBPase inhibitor (Compound G) could provide better antihyperglycemic activity than treatment with either agent alone.<br>
Male db/db mice were purchased at 8 weeks of age from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Maine). The mice were maintained under standard vivarium conditions (25°C, 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle) and received powdered Purina 5008 chow and water ad libitum. At 10 weeks of age, animals with blood glucose &gt;400 mg/dl and 
As shown in the table below, on the last treatment day (day 18), blood glucose levels in the combination group were significantly lower than those in the control, as well as the Troglitazone and Compound G monotherapy groups.<br><br>
(PEG 400) to Group 3 at a dose of 250 mg/kg on the 4th and 7th day of the study. Blood glucose levels were measured in tail vein samples by means of a HemoCue glucose analyzer (HemoCue Inc., Mission Viejo, CA). Values are expressed as the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean. Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Results are considered significant with p
On the fourth day of the study, the Troglitazone-treated groups (2 and 3), as expected, showed significantly lower fed blood glucose values than the untreated controls (Group 1):<br><br>
Following the above measurements, Group 3 was treated with a single oral dose of Compound A and Groups 1 and 2 with an equivalent volume of vehicle. Nine hours post administration, blood glucose levels were found to have increased in the control group (Group 1), to have stayed essentially the same in Group 2, but to have significantly decreased by 30% in the Compound A-treated group (Group 3):<br><br><br>
On the 7th day of the study, a second dose of Compound A (Group 3) or vehicle (Groups 1 and 2) was administered. Food was withheld for 6 hours post drug/vehicle administration. As shown in the table below, the mice in Group 3 (combination therapy) achieved blood glucose levels which were on average 44% lower than those of Group 2 (Troglitazone monotherapy) during the treatment period.<br><br>
Combination treatment of Troglitazone and Compound A resulted in significantly lower blood glucose levels both in the fed and fasted state than when Troglitazone was administered alone. This study suggests that the addition of an FBPase inhibitor to the treatment regimen of patients on insulin sensitizer therapy could provide significantly improved glycemic control.<br>
