Vehicle Parking Brake Lever Disposition Structure [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle provided with a parking brake lever operated for setting a wheel into a locked state in preparation for parking the vehicle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
A vehicle parking brake system is conventionally known, in which a head pipe for supporting a handle bar is covered with a front cover and a parking brake lever and a grip are disposed on the underside of the front cover.  (See, for example, Patent Document I.)<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2002-154469 (FIG. 5) [0003]<br>
The system disclosed in Patent Document 1 will be described with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 11 is an explanatory view showing the basic construction of a prior art system.  A parking brake lever 365 and a grip 366 are housed in a recessed portion 373<br>
formed in a front cover 331. The parking brake lever 365 and the grip 366 are disposed so as not to protrude from a surface 374 of the front cover 331.<br>
Since the parking brake lever 365 and the grip 366 are disposed on the same right-hand side as a throttle grip 386, a rider can easily reach his or her right hand to operate the parking brake lever 365. [0004]<br>
The parking brake lever 365 is offset from the center of the vehicle with an axis thereof running generally vertically. An operating mechanism exists in a direction of vehicle width.  This necessitates a space for accommodating the operating mechanism in the direction of vehicle width.  The prior art system, however, has a space restriction problem, especially with the case of a vehicle that has no front cover 331.  Specifically, placing the parking brake lever 365 having the operating mechanism in the vehicle width direction enlarges a space requirement around the head pipe. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0005]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a disposition structure of a vehicle parking brake lever<br>
that requires a small space around a parking brake lever and enhances operability and an operating feel.  The invention is particularly preferable for a type of vehicle having no cowling at the front or rear, or on the right or left, of a front fork.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0006]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim I is characterized in that, in a vehicle provided with a parking brake lever operated for setting a wheel into a locked state in preparation for parking the vehicle, the parking brake lever is disposed in an offset position from the centerline of the vehicle, the parking brake lever is oriented toward a fore-aft direction when operated, and the axis of the parking brake lever is inclined relative to a vertical line perpendicular to a ground surface.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 2 is characterized in that the parking brake lever is disposed at a position near a head pipe.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 3 is characterized in that the head pipe is covered with a<br>
front cover, a lever box is provided on a side surface of the front cover, and an upper portion of the parking brake lever is protruded from the lever box. [0009]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 4 is characterized in that the lever box is formed, in a plan view, to be narrower in width than a seat, on which the rider sits. [0010]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 5 is characterized in that the lever box is formed, in a front view, to be narrower on a downward side. [0011]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 6 is characterized in that an outer side surface of the lever box is formed to run substantially in parallel with the parking brake lever. [0012]<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 7 is characterized in that the axis of the parking brake lever is oriented toward a master cylinder. [Effects of the Invention] [0013]<br>
In accordance with claim 1 of the present invention,<br>
the parking brake lever is disposed in an offset position from the centerline of the vehicle and oriented toward the fore-aft direction when operated.  In addition, the axis of the parking brake lever is inclined relative to the vertical line perpendicular to the ground surface. The invention thus has a good effect of enhancing an operating feel dramatically. [0014]<br>
In accordance with claim 2 of the present invention, the parking brake lever is disposed at a position near the head pipe.  This means that the parking brake lever is located near the handle bar. The rider then needs to move his or her hand from the handle bar to the parking brake lever only a short distance.  The invention thus has a good effect of enhancing operability of the parking brake lever dramatically. [0015]<br>
In accordance with claim 3 of the present invention, the head pipe is covered with the front cover, the lever box is provided on the side surface of the front cover, and the upper portion of the parking brake lever is protruded from this lever box. The invention thus has a good effect of allowing the rider to quickly take hold of the parking brake lever.<br>
[0016]<br>
In accordance with claim 4 of the present invention,<br>
the lever box is formed, in a plan view, to be narrower<br>
in width than the seat, on which the rider sits.  The<br>
invention thus has a good effect of avoiding expansion of<br>
space requirement in the width direction.<br>
[0017]<br>
In accordance with claim 5 of the present invention,<br>
the lever box is forme^d, in a front view, so as to be narrower on its downward side. The invention thus has a good effect of designing the lever box compactly.<br>
[0018]<br>
In accordance with claim 6 of the present invention, the outer side surface of the lever box is formed to run substantially in parallel with the axis of the parking brake lever. The invention thus has a good effect of making the space requirement of the lever box even more compact.<br>
[0019]<br>
In accordance with claim 7 of the present invention, the axis of the parking brake lever is oriented toward the master cylinder.  Accordingly, it is possible to set the parking brake lever at a suitable angle in such a manner that the rider can put smoothly or easily his or<br>
er hand onto the parking brake lever after the rider releases the handle bar.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0020]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings should be viewed in the direction of reference numerals.<br><br>

FIG. 8 is a plan view showing a front portion of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention. [FIG. 9]<br>
FIG. 9 is a perspective view showing the front portion of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention. [FIGS. 10(a) and 10(b)]<br>
FIGS. 10(a) and 10(b) are explanatory views showing operations of the parking brake lever. [FIG. 11]<br>
FIG. 11 is taken from FIG. 5 of Patent Document 1.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with a scooter type vehicle used as an example for a low-floor vehicle.  The low-floor vehicle may be a two-wheeled, three-wheeled, or a four-wheeled vehicle. The present invention is applicable to any type of vehicle, as long as the vehicle is constructed so as to meet the following requirements.  Specifically, a front wheel and a rear wheel are provided at the front and in the rear of a vehicle body frame, respectively. Of the vehicle body frame, a main frame that extends rearwardly from the head pipe is V-shaped or U-shaped as viewed from a side.  The main frame is built so that the rider can easily stride it. [0021]<br>
FIG. 1 is a side elevational view showing a scooter type vehicle according to the present invention. A<br><br>
scooter type vehicle 10 is basically constructed as follows.  Specifically, a handle bar 13 is steerably mounted on a head pipe 12 provided at the front of a vehicle body frame 11. A front wheel 15 and a front fender 16 are mounted to a front fork 14 connected to the handle bar 13.<br>
A separate frame 18 is mounted to the vehicle body frame 11.  A headlamp 19, a turn signal lamp 21, and the like are attached to the separate frame 18. A step 22 is fitted to a down tube 17. A power unit 23 is mounted vertically swingably in the rear of the vehicle body frame 11.  A rear wheel 24 is mounted at a rear portion of the power unit 23.  A rider's seat 25 is provided obliquely upwardly and forwardly of the rear wheel 24 and a passenger seat combined with a seat back 26 is provided upward of the rear wheel 24.  The scooter type vehicle 10, being constructed as described above, is a two-seater light vehicle.<br>
A characteristic feature about the appearance of the scooter type low-floor vehicle is the area around its front portion, at which no cowling for covering the area surrounding the front fork 14 provided, including the front, rear, or sides thereof.  This enhances a nimble look of the front of the vehicle.  In addition, the<br><br>
vehicle is less susceptible to effect from running wind the vehicle body receives and the rider can get a good steering feel.  On the other hand, it is rather difficult to properly dispose the lever or secure a space for personal effects or the like. [0022]<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, a reference numeral 27 represents a handle bar post cover, a reference numeral 28 represents a side cover, a reference numeral 29 represents a rear cushion, a reference numeral 31 represents a stand, and a reference numeral 32 represents a grab rail. [0023]<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevational view showing a one-seater version of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention. The one-seater version shares the same basic construction with the two-seater version, as shown in FIG. 1. The same reference numerals are borrowed from the two-seater version to omit explanations.  FIG. 2 shows where the passenger seat combined with a seat back 26 is raised into an upright position to serve as a seat back for a rider M.  FIG. 2 also shows that baggage 33, such as a tent, is loaded at the front portion of the separate frame 18.<br><br>
[0024]<br>
The one-seater version is also characterized in that not: only the handle bar 13 and the grab rail 32, but also the separate frame 18, the down tube 17, a lower pipe 34 extending from the down tube 17, and a rear frame 35 are all exposed. [0025]<br>
In the conventional scooter type vehicle, it is common practice to cover the vehicle body frame with a vehicle body cover to ensure that most of the vehicle body frame is not exposed. According to the present invention, on the other hand, a good part of the vehicle body frame is exposed to exhibit a completely new appearance feature. [0026]<br>
FIG. 3 is an exploded view showing the vehicle body frame of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.  The vehicle body frame 11 includes the following parts: specifically, a main frame 43 extending from the head pipe 12 and being V-shaped or U-shaped as viewed from a side; the rear frame 35 forming a rear portion of the main frame 43 or extending the main frame 43 rearwardly; the down tube 17 drooping downwardly from the head pipe 12; the lower pipe 34 extending<br><br>
substantially horizontally from the down tube 17; a center frame 44 rising upwardly from a rear end of the lower pipe 34; and a stay 45 connecting the center frame 44 with the rear frame 35. [0027]<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the frame of a simple shape shown separated upwardly is the separate frame 18.<br>
The separate frame 18 will be described in detail in the following. The vehicle body frame 11 will be described in detail when the embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 5 later. [0028]<br>
FIG. 4 is an explanatory view for explaining the operation of the separate frame 18 according to the present invention. The separate frame 18 is a U-shaped pipe frame in a plan view.  The separate frame 18 serves useful purposes as detailed in the following. Specifically, the turn signal lamps 21 and the headlamp 19 can be mounted on a lamp support bracket 48. A meter unit 61 can be mounted on a baggage receiving pipe 47. A parking brake lever 63 can be mounted via a stay 62 to the right of a bracket 53. [0029]<br>
It is also possible to shorten the time required<br><br>
for assembling parts in an assembly line by taking the following approach.  Specifically, vehicle parts, for example, the turn signal lamps 21, the headlamp 19, the meter unit 61, the parking brake lever 63, and the like, are previously assembled to the separate frame 18 (to form a subassembly) and then the subassembly (which is what is exactly shown in FIG. 4) is assembled to the head pipe 12 and the main frame 43.<br>
The separate frame 18 is provided with the baggage receiving pipe 47 on the top surface at the front portion thereof, the lamp support bracket 48 and a baggage fixing hook 49 on the bottom at the front thereof, and cover fixing plates 51, 51 on the bottom surface thereof.  The separate frame 18 further includes a bracket 53 having a hole 52 therein on the top surface at the front portion thereof and U-shaped brackets 54 on the bottom surface in the rear portion thereof. [0030]<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a front portion plate 57 having holes 56, 56 therein is provided on the front surface of the head pipe 12.  A rear portion plate 59 having a hole 58 therein is provided on the top surface at the front portion of the rear frame 35.<br>
The rear portion plate 59 is disposed at a position<br><br>
near a connection 55 between the main frame 43 and the rear frame 35.  The connection 55 is a portion, at which one main frame 43 meets two rear frames 35.  The connection 55 has a high rigidity.  If the rear portion plate 59 is provided at a position near (rearward according the embodiment of the present invention) this highly rigid connection 55, it is advantageous in terms of strength in supporting the separate frame 18. [0031]<br>
The bracket 53 is then bolted to the front portion plate 57.  The U-shaped bracket 54 is bolted to the rear portion plate 59.  The separate frame 18 can thereby be integrated with the head pipe 12 and the main frame 43. Configuration after these integrating procedures will be described in the following. [0032]<br>
FIG. 5 is a side elevational view showing the vehicle body frame of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.  FIG. 5 shows where the following parts are mounted.  Specifically, the separate frame 18 is mounted to the head pipe 12 and the rear frame 35. A center cover portion 64 integrally including the handle bar post cover 27 is then placed.  The side cover 28 is attached between the separate frame 18 and<br><br>
the lower pipe 34 using bolts 65.  A step 22L is then mounted to the lower pipe 34. [0033]<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the front surface of the handle bar post cover 27 is formed into a flat surface to provide an ample baggage space at the front thereof.<br>
A shelf portion 27a is formed in the rear at an upper portion of the handle bar post cover 27.  The shelf portion 27a is one step down from the handle bar post cover 27.  An ignition switch-handle bar interlocked security system 70 is attached to the shelf portion 27a. [0034]<br>
FIG. 6 is a side elevational view showing a parking brake lever mounting portion according to the present invention.  The direction of arrow FR in FIG. 6 indicates the forward direction of the vehicle and that of arrow T indicates the upward direction of the vehicle.  For easier understanding of the position, at which the parking brake lever 63 is provided, the bracket 53 (see FIG. 4) and the like are omitted. [0035]<br>
The parking brake lever 63 is mounted as detailed in the following.  Specifically, the stay 62 is mounted by way of the bracket 53 not shown (see FIG. 4) from part of<br><br>
the separate frame 18. A flange portion 76 is provided at a leading end portion of the stay 62.  A lever seat portion 77 is attached using a bolt not shown.  The parking brake lever 63 is mounted on the lever seat portion 77 by way of a lever axis 78.  There is disposed a spring 79 hooked between a lever side mounting portion 63a and an end portion 77a of the lever seat portion.  The spring 79 produces a self-returning force for returning the parking brake lever 63 to a forward position when the parking brake lever 63 is pulled further rearward from a parked state.<br>
A reference numeral 63b represents a parking brake cable fixing portion provided for the parking brake lever 63 .  A cable not shown is used to operate a brake provided for the rear wheel to lock the rear wheel.<br>
The parking brake lever 63 is oriented in such a manner that the lever is operated in the fore-aft direction of the vehicle about the lever axis 78. Namely, the parking brake lever 63 can be moved in the fore-after direction by operating a grip 81. [0036]<br>
FIG. 7 is a view on arrow 7 of FIG. 6.  FIG. 7 shows where the following parts are mounted.  Specifically, the bracket 53 is mounted upwardly of the vehicle from<br><br>
part of the separate frame 18.  The stay 62 is attached so as to protrude rightwardly from the bracket 53 .  The lever seat portion 77 is mounted to a leading end portion of the stay 62 at an angle of 6 inclined from the upward direction of the vehicle. A parking brake lever mechanism including the parking brake lever 63, the spring 79, and the like, is provided in the lever seat portion 77. [0037]<br>
The arrangement of the parking brake lever 63 is characterized by the following points.  Specifically, the parking brake lever 63 is disposed at an offset position OL that is offset by a distance W from a vehicle centerline CL.  Further, an axis XL of the parking brake lever 63 is inclined at an angle of 9 relative to a vertical line OL perpendicular to the ground surface.<br>
The angle 6 is about 30°, which satisfies two requirements of operability and the degree of protrusion in the width direction of the lever box.<br>
The axis of the parking brake lever 63 is oriented toward a master cylinder 401. Accordingly, it is possible to set the parking brake lever at a suitable angle in such a manner that the rider can put smoothly or easily his or her hand onto the parking brake lever after the rider releases the handle bar.<br><br>
[0038]<br>
FIG. 8 is a plan view showing a front portion of<br>
the scooter type vehicle according to the present<br>
invention.  FIG. 8 shows that a grip 81 of the parking brake lever 63 is disposed at a position near the head pipe 12.  Specifically, the grip 81 is located at a position a distance Wl away rightwardly from the head pipe 12.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 6, similarly, a top end portion T of the head pipe 12 is substantially on the same level as the grip 81.  In the height direction, too, therefore, the grip 81 of the parking brake lever 63 is disposed at a level near the head pipe 12.<br>
[0039]<br>
The parking brake lever 63 is disposed at the point near the head pipe 12. The parking brake lever 63 is therefore situated near the handle bar 13 (see FIG. 8). The rider therefore needs to move his or her hand over a short distance from the handle bar 13 to the parking brake lever 63.  Operability is thus dramatically enhanced.<br>
[0040]<br>
Referring back to FIG. 8, a lever box 82 is formed to be narrower, in a plan view, than the width of the seat, on which the rider sits, or 2 X W3.<br><br>
Specifically, a length W2 from the vehicle centerline CL to an outer surface 83 of the lever box 82 is formed so as to be shorter than a length W3 from the vehicle centerline CL to an outer surface 84 of the rider's seat 25, that is, W2 
This avoids expansion of the space requirement of the lever box 82 in the width direction. [0041]<br>
FIG. 9 is a perspective view showing the front portion of the scooter type vehicle according to the present invention.  FIG. 9 shows where the following parts are mounted.  Specifically, the head pipe 12 (see FIG. 8) is covered with the handle bar post cover 27.  The lever box 82 is provided on a side surface of the handle bar post cover 27. An upper portion of the parking brake lever 63 is protruded upward from the lever box 82.  Then, the grip 81 is fitted to the upper portion of the parking brake lever 63. [0042]<br>
The upper portion of the parking brake lever 63 is protruded upwardly from the lever box 82 provided on the side surface of the handle bar post cover 27.  In addition, the grip 81 is mounted on the upper portion of the parking brake lever 63. This allows the rider to quickly<br><br>
take hold of the parking brake lever 63. [0043]<br>
The lever box 82 is formed to be narrower on a downward side 85 thereof in a front view.  This allows the lever box 82 to be built compactly.<br>
This results in space requirement around the handle bar post cover 27 being inhibited. [0044]<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the outer surface 83 of the lever box 82 is formed in substantially parallel with the axis XL of the parking brake lever 63.  The space requirement of the lever box 82 can therefore be made even more compact. [0045]<br>
The effects of the present invention will be explained.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 7, the parking brake lever 63 is disposed at the offset position from the vehicle centerline CL and oriented in the fore-aft direction (in the direction of front and back side in FIG. 7) when operated.  Further, the axis XL of the parking brake lever 63 is inclined at an angle of 6 relative to the vertical line OL perpendicular to the ground surface.  This enhances an operating feel of the parking brake lever 63<br><br><br><br>
dramatically. [0046]<br>
FIGS. 10(a) and 10(b) are explanatory views showing operations of the parking brake lever 63.<br>
