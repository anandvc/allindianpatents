5-MEMBERED HETEROCYCLE-BASED   P38   KINASE  INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD<br>
Provided herein are 5-membered heterocycle-, including pyrazole- and imidazole-, based compounds which have cytokine inhibitory activity. Also provided are uses of the compounds for treating conditions associated with p38a and p kinases and for treating p38 kinase-associated conditions. BACKGROUND<br>
A large number of cytokines participate in the inflammatory response, including IL-1, IL6, IL-8 and TNF-a. Overproduction of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and congestive heart failure, among others (Henry et aL, Drugs FuU 24:1345-1354 (1999); Salituro et aL, Curr. Med. Chenu 6:807-823 (1999)). Evidence in human patients indicates that protein antagonists of cytokines are effective in treating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example, a monoclonal antibody to TNF-a (Remicade) (Rankin et aL, Br. J. RheumatoL 34:334-342 (1995)), and a soluble TNF-a receptor-Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) (Moreland et aL, 25 Ann. Intern. Med., 130:478-486 (1999)).<br>
The biosynthesis of TNF-a occurs in many cell types in response to ah external stimulus, such as, for example, a mitogen, an infectious organism, or trauma. Important mediators of TNF-a production are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and in particular, p38 kinases. These kinases are activated in response to various stress stimuli, including but not limited to proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, ultraviolet light, and osmotic shock. Activation of p38 requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) on threonine and tyrosine within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif characteristic of p38 isozymes.<br>
There are four known isoforms of p38, i.e., p38a, p38p, p38y, and p388. The a and p isoforms are expressed in inflammatory cells and are key modulators of TNF-a production. Inhibiting the p38a and p enzymes in cells results in reduced levels of TNF-a expression. Also, administering inhibitors of p38oc and P in animal models of inflammatory disease has proven that such inhibitors are effective in treating<br><br>
those diseases. Accordingly, the p38 enzymes serve an important role in inflammatory processes mediated by IL-1 and TNF-a. See, e.g.9 U.S. Patent Nos. 6,277,989,6,130,235,6,147,080, 5,945,418,6,251,914,5,977,103,5,658,903,5,932,576, and 6,087,496; and in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 00/56738, WO 01/27089, WO 01/34605, WO 00/12497, WO 00/56738, WO 00/12497 and WO 00/12074. See also, US. Patent Nos. 6,376,527; 6,316,466 and 6,444,696; and International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 99/57101, WO 02/40486, WO 03/032970, WO 03/033482, WO 03/032971, WO 03/032986, WO 03/032980, WO 03/032987, WO 03/033483, WO 03/033457 and WO 03/032972.<br>

In addition, p38 inhibitors provided herein inhibit the expression of inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2), also referred to as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Accordingly, additional p38-associated conditions include edema, analgesia, fever and pain, such as neuromuscular pain, headache, pain caused by cancer, dental pain and arthritis pain. The inventive compounds also may be used to treat veterinary viral infections, such as lentivirus infections, including, but not limited to equine infectious anemia virus; or retro virus infections, including feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and canine immunodeficiency virus. When the terms "p38-associated condition" or Mp38-associated disease or disorder" are used herein, each is intended to encompass all of the conditions identified above as if repeated at length, as well as any other condition that is affected by p38 kinase activity.<br>

EXAMPLE 175<br>
The ability of the compounds provided herein to inhibit the synthesis or the activity of cytokines can be demonstrated using the following in vitro assays. Generation of p38 kinases<br>
cDNAs of human p38a and p were cloned by PCR. The a and P cDNAs were subcloned into DEST2 plasmid (Gateway, InVitrogen). His6-p38 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using Ni+2-NTA-agarose. His6-p38 protein was activated by incubating with constitutively active MKK6. Active p38 was separated from MKK6 by affinity chromatography. Constitutively active MKK6 was generated in a manner similar to Raingeaud et al [MoL Cell. BioL, 1247-1255 (1996)]. TNF-a Production by LPS-Stimulated PBMCs<br>
Heparinized human whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from human whole blood by Accu-paque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 106/ml in assay medium (RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum). 175 μL of cell suspension was incubated with 10 |iL of test compound (in 4% DMSO) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 30 minutes at RT. 15 μL of LPS (13.33 ug/ml stock) was then added to the cell suspension and the plate was incubated for 18 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Following incubation, the culture medium was collected and stored at -20°C.<br><br>
THP-1 cells (TIB-202, ATCC) were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 1 x 105/ml in assay medium (RPMI medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum). 175 μL of cell suspension was incubated with 10 μL of test compound (in 4% DMSO) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 30 minutes at RT. 15 μL of LPS (13.33 ug/ml stock) was then added to the cell suspension and the plate was incubated for 18 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Following incubation, the culture medium was collected and stored at -20°C.<br>

Concentrations of TNF-a and IC50 values for test compounds (concentration of compound that inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-a production by 50%) were calculated by four parameter logistic curve (SigmaPlot, SPSS, Inc.). p38a Assay<br>
The p38a assay employed is based on measurement of ADP released in the reaction of interest through NADH oxidation obtained by coupling with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions. The assays were performed in 384-well UV-plates. The final volume was 25 yL prepared from the addition of 2.5 μL compound dissolved in 10% DMSO, 17.5 -L of assay buffer and 5 \xL of ATP. Assay buffer contains the following reagents to give final concentration in the assay: 25 mM HEPES, 20 mM 2-glycerophosphate, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.12 mM NADH, 3.1 mg/ml LDH, 6.67 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.25 mM peptide substrate, 2 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween 80 and 20 nM p38a kinase from Upstate. Test compounds are preincubated with p38oc kinase for 60 min and the reaction started by addition of ATP to 0.15 mM final concentration. Reaction rates were measured at 340 nm using SpectraMax plate-reading spectrophotometer for 10 min at 37°C. Inhibition data were analyzed by non-linear least-squares regression using SigmaPlot. TNF-a Production by LPS-StimuIated Mice<br>

sedated by CO2:O22 inhalation and a blood sample was obtained. Serum was separated and analyzed for TNF-a concentrations by commercial ELISA assay per the manufacturer's instructions (BioSource International). Test compounds were administered orally at various times before LPS injection. The compounds were dosed either as suspensions or as solutions in various vehicles or solubilizing agents.<br>
