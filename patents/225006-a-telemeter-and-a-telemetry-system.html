DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A telemetry system 10 according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention is illustrated in FIG 1 and 2. Telemetry system<br>
10 comprsies a telemeter 100, a transmitter 118 and a remote<br>
station 200. Telemeter 100 is carried upon a mobile asse4t, such<br>
as an aircraft 20, locomotive 22, ship 24, or the like and<br>
configured to monitor the condition of the asset upon which it is<br>
installed. Telemeter 100 in conjucntion with transmitter 118<br>
transmits messages, referred to herein as diagnostic messages,<br>
containing information about the condition and performance of the<br>
assets to remote station 200. The term 'condition' refers to the<br>
state of readiness, or fitness for operation of an asset or of a<br>
particular component of an asset.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, diagnostic<br>
messages are relatyed directly from the asset, such as aircraft<br>
20, being monitored (referred to herein as a source) to a remote<br>
station 200 (referred to herein as a destination). According to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention diagnostic messages<br>
are relayed in series from a source asset, such as aircraft 20,<br>
to a successor asset, such as aircraft 21, and in some cases<br>
from a successor asset to another successor asset, and so on<br>
until the diagnostic message arrives at its remote station<br>
destination 200.<br>
An exemplary format suitable for diagnostic messages is<br>
illustrated in FIG 7. The message format comprises a<br>
synchronization preamble, address bits, priority bits if<br>
desired, a data field, an encryption flag denoting the presence<br>
or absence of encryption of the data in the data field, and an<br>
error detection field.<br>
Diagnostic messages are relayed between source assets,<br>
successors assets and remote station destinations via down lines<br>
45. Down links 45 according to the present invention are<br>
communications channels comprising unlicensed or<br>
Industrial/Scientific/Medical (ISM) band, transmissions, Three<br>
ISM bands are now available in the United States for using spread-<br>
spectrum communications techniques: 902-928 MHz; 2400-2483.5 MHz; and 5725-5850<br>
MHz.<br>
Accordingly, transmitter 118, according to one embodiment of the Invention, is<br>
adapted to transmit in an ISM frequency band, in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention data links 45 further include non ISM band radio frequency channels such as<br>
those licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention telemeter 100 is Installed upon aircraft<br>
20. Telemeter 100 monitors one or more Jet engine conditions of aircraft 20 and transmits<br>
messages containing information about the performance of the aircraft between aircraft<br>
20 and remote station 200. Remote station 200 utilizes the information contained In the<br>
messages to assess engine performance, identify and predict failure conditions, and in<br>
one embodiment to relay corrective signals to aircraft 20 via data uplink 30 to correct or<br>
compensate for failure conditions. In one embodiment of the invention data uplink 30<br>
comprises ISM band transmissions. In another embodiment of the invention data uplink<br>
30 comprises commands and data in an FCC licensed radio frequency band.<br>
As will be readily understood by those skilled in the art, the invention is not limited<br>
to aircraft telemeters and remote stations. Rather, the telemeters of the present invention<br>
may be Installed upon any mobile asset, and the messages relayed to a remote station,<br>
such as a satellite, shipboard or other receiving station which is not ground based.<br>
A telemeter 100 according to an embodiment of the invention is illustrated in block<br>
diagram form In FIG. 2. Telemeter 100 comprises as major components transmitter 118,<br>
receiver 116 diagnostic message processor 150, memory 152, display 190, and condition<br>
sensors 320, as shown in FIG, 2. Condition sensors 320 monitor performance conditions<br>
and parameters such as turbine speed, and exhaust gas temperature.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention telemeter 100 is implemented using avionics<br>
equipment already hi place on aircraft 20, as for example VHF, or UHF transcervers for<br>
other avionics<br>
applications licensed by the FCC for operation in RF bands. For<br>
example, Very High Frequency (VHF) transceiver units, not used over<br>
oceans where there is no line of sight to a ground station, may be<br>
employed to transmit and receive diagnostic messages on licensed<br>
bands during periods when these VHF transceivers are inactive. In<br>
one embodiment of the invention transmitter 118 includes an ISM<br>
modem of a type readily commercially available.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, telemeter<br>
100 includes a low power 2.4 GHZ ISM transceiver, represented in<br>
FIG. 2 by receiver 116 and transmitter 118. Receiver 116 and<br>
transmitter 118 include modems employing typical direct sequence<br>
spread spectrum modulation schemes to modulate a carrier with<br>
diagnostic message information. Such schemes may be implemented<br>
in synchronous mode or in transmitted reference mode to alleviate the<br>
synchronization overhead.<br>
The ISM band embodiment of the present invention<br>
relies on in-flight use of the 2.4 GHz ISM at 2.4GHz -2.4835 GHz.<br>
Commercially available chip sets such as the Harris PRISM™ chip set<br>
and a wide variety of support electronics are readily commercially<br>
available for use in this embodiment. For example, one embodiment<br>
of the invention employs Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)<br>
techniques to maintain a spreading factor of at least 10, as required by<br>
United States FCC regulations. The Harris PRISM set spreads with a<br>
factor of 11 and is programmable for up to a factor of 16, making it<br>
advantageous for use in implementing an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. An alternative embodiment of the present invention<br>
employs 5.7GHz band transceivers.<br>
Table 1 shows exemplary link specifications developed<br>
by simulating an asset-to-asset link according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. According to the example shown in Table 1, an<br>
airplane to airplane link in the 2.4 GHz ISM band between two aircraft,<br>
each at a minimum cruise altitude of 20,000 feet and separated by a<br>
line of sight distance of about 400 miles will support about a 1.2kilobit<br>
per second link between the two aircraft, without coding, at a bit error<br>
rate of no greater than 10 '5. In an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention the link is operated at a variable data rate depending<br>
on the available link margin. In that case, both ends of the link are<br>
configured to observe the received error rates, calculated over groups<br>
of known bits or by observing various check sum failure rates, and<br>
increase or decrease their signaling rates accordingly.<br>
FIG. 5 shows exemplary link specifications for an asset<br>
to remote station link wherein the remote station is a ground based<br>
station.<br>
FIG. 6 shows exemplary link specifications for a remote<br>
station to asset link wherein the remote station is a ground station and<br>
the asset is an aircraft.<br>
Telemeter 100 also includes read/write memory 152.<br>
Read/write memory 152, which is dynamic random access memory in<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, performs storage of<br>
incoming messages for retransmission and keeps a history of system<br>
performance measures. System performance measures include, but<br>
are not limited to, measures selected from the group comprising:<br>
number and size of messages successfully received, number of<br>
messages successfully transmitted, latency time distribution, i.e., a<br>
histogram of the times that the successfully received messages were<br>
stored by the receiving aircraft before they were successfully<br>
retransmitted, link quality indicators such as signal to noise estimates,<br>
and communications protocol efficiency, e.g. number of transmission<br>
retries per message.<br>
A system 100 for telemetry of information from aircraft in<br>
flight to a ground station according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention typically comprises a plurality of mobile assets, referred to<br>
hereinafter as nodes, in radio communication with each other. Each<br>
node may be selected from the group comprising aircraft, land vehicles<br>
such as a railroad locomotives, ships, ground transmitting or receiving<br>
stations, or communications satellites. Each node is equipped with a<br>
telemeter 100 for relaying diagnostic messages between nodes and<br>
from a source node to a destination ground station. The source node<br>
originates the diagnostic message and determines the most efficient<br>
link; to the desired destination ground station through intermediate<br>
nodes. The source node then transmits the diagnostic message to the<br>
first node in the link, that node receives and retransmits the diagnostic<br>
message to the next mode in the link, etc. until the message is finally<br>
received by the desired ground station. In this manner the aircraft<br>
pass the data by relay between aircraft in mutual line of sight such that<br>
the data is efficiently migrated from the source node to the ground<br>
station. According to one embodiment of the invention, remote station<br>
250 employs a phased array antenna that has a line of sight to aircraft<br>
at cruise altitude.<br>
In order to establish an efficient link, the source node,<br>
and each successive node in the link, must select its successor node<br>
such that the message is transmitted from node to node while the<br>
successor node is in line of site with the predecessor node. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention each node's transceiver is<br>
provided with flight plan information in order to facilitate the selection<br>
of a successor node to which to transmit the diagnostic message.<br>
Flight plan information is information related to the altitudes, flight<br>
paths, and times for flights of specific aircraft. In one embodiment of the invention flight<br>
plan Information is obtained from an aircraft tracking services. An example of such a<br>
system includes, but is not limited to Air Track. Airtrack is a real-time aircraft tracking<br>
program available from METSYS Software and Services, Cropton, Pickering, North<br>
Yorkshire, Y018 8HL, England. Flight plan data from the database is loaded into the<br>
Diagnostic message processor 150 of each aircraft's telemeter 100. Thereafter, processor<br>
100 of the source node selects successors based on the flight plan data and desired<br>
destination remote station.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, remote station 200 comprises a receiver 250 adapted to<br>
receive frequencies in an unlicensed frequency band such as an ISM frequency band.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention employs a receiving network 500 comprising<br>
several spaced apart remote stations 200 as illustrated in FIG. 4. Remote stations 200<br>
are spaced from each other so as to provide receiver coverage over the entire<br>
geographical area of interest 120, In this case the United States, as illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
The radio horizon for a line of sight path from an object at H feet above the earth is<br>
2H miles. Thus, a radio receiver on the ground near Evendale, Ohio is capable of line<br>
of sight contact with a plane at 20,000 feet whose ground point falls in the circle 300 as<br>
shown in Figure 3. The circle is about 200 miles In radius. For planes at higher altitudes,<br>
the circle of coverage expands. Figure 4 shows a virtual covering of the Continental<br>
United States with only 40 receiver sites. A site center is marked with an V.<br>
The system Includes a protocol for fixing and monitoring schedule and performing<br>
monitoring hand-off from receiver site to receiver site. The protocol relies upon a ground-<br>
to-air link for flow or transmission control including. Examples of ground to air links<br>
suitable for transmission control include, but are not limited to: adaptive transmission rate<br>
control; provision/non-provision of error correction coding; power control; and time of<br>
transmission.<br>
ft will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, while the invention has been<br>
illustrated and described herein in accordance with the patent statutes, modifications and<br>
changes may be made in the disclosed embodiments without departing from the true<br>
spirit and scope of the invention, ft is, therefore, to be understood that the appended<br>
