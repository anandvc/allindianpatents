DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified conceptual illustration of a distributed document processing architecture, constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the architecture of Fig. 1 one or more computers 100, such as for use by data entry clerks, are configured for communication with one or more computers 102 via a communications medium 104, such as the Internet. Similarly, one or more customer computers 106 are configured for communication with computer 102 via communications medium 104 or any other suitable communications medium. Any of computers 106 and/or any of computers 102 may be configured to perform optical character recognition on images of documents that include portions that require optical character recognition, such as, but not limited to, handwritten portions, and may be otherwise configured to perform portions of any of the methods described hereinbelow.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 2A and 2B, which, taken together, is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the method of Figs. 2A and 2B one or more data entry clerks at one or more of computers 100 provide an availability profile to computer 102 via communications medium 104 or any<br>
other suitable communications medium. The available profile of a data entry clerk preferably indicates the availability of the clerk to perform manual data entry tasks at various times, such as by specifying specific dates, days of the week, hours of the day, etc. Independently, any of customer computers 106 send one or more work orders to computer 102 via communications medium 104 or any other suitable communications medium. Each work order preferably indicates a time frame within which a job may be serviced, as well as some measure of the magnitude of the job, such as the number of documents to be processed. Computer 102 then identifies those data clerks whose availability profile indicates that the data entry clerk would be available to work on the job within the indicated time frame.<br>
Together with the work order, or separately therefrom, computer 106 sends to computer 102 for processing one or more document images that comprise the job specified by the work order. Computer 102 then decomposes each image into one or more data entry region sub-images using conventional techniques, where each sub-image includes an element that requires interpretation or recognition, now referred to as a recognition element, such as, but not limited to, a handwritten element. Computer 102 then provides each sub-image to one or more available data entry clerks at one or more computers 100, typically together with a unique identifier identifying the sub-image. The data entry clerk then views the sub-image, keys in a data entry value from the characters appearing in the recognition element of the sub-image, and transmits the data entry value to computer 102, typically together with the unique identifier where provided. For each document image, computer 102 collates data entry values received from data entry clerks into a character-based electronic document corresponding to the document image. Optionally (optional steps are shown in dashed lines), where a single sub-image is provided to more than one data entry clerk who each provide an associated data entry value, if a predetermined number of these values are the same, the matching result may be selected for collation as indicated above.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 3A and 3B, which, taken together, is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method of Figs. 3 A and 3B is similar to the method of Figs. 2A and 2B except as is now<br>
noted. Unlike the method of Figs. 2A and 2B, computer 106 decomposes each document image into one or more data entry region sub-images using conventional techniques, where each sub-image includes a recognition element. Computer 106 then provides each sub-image to computer 102, typically together with a unique identifier identifying the sub-image. Computer 102 then provides each sub-image to one or more available data entry clerks at one or more computers 100, typically together with the unique identifier identifying the sub-image. The data entry clerk then views the sub-image, keys in a data entry value from the characters appearing in the recognition element of the sub-image, and transmits the data entry value to computer 102, typically together with the unique identifier where provided. For each document image, computer 102 collates data entry values received from data entry clerks into a character-based electronic document corresponding to the document image. Alternatively, computer 102 may forward the data entry values to computer 106 which then collates the data entry values into a character-based electronic document corresponding to the document image. In either case, where a single sub-image is provided to more than one data entry clerk who each provide an associated data entry value, if a predetermined number of these values are the same, the matching result may be selected for collation as indicated above.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 4A and 4B, which, taken together, is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method of Figs. 4A and 4B is similar to the method of Figs. 2A and 2B except as is now noted. As in the method of Figs. 2A and 2B computer 102 or 106 decomposes each image into one or more data entry region sub-images using conventional techniques, where each sub-image includes a recognition element. However, each sub-image is then subject to conventional OCR processing. Where the result of OCR processing for a sub-image indicates that the sub-image was not successfully processed, or if a confidence rating related to a result of said performing optical character recognition is below a predefined threshold, computer 102 provides the sub-image to one or more available data entry clerks at one or more computers 100. The data entry clerk then views the sub-image, keys in a data entry value from the characters appearing in the recognition element of the sub-image, and transmits the data entry value to computer 102. For each document image, computer 102<br>
collates successful OCR results and data entry values received from data entry clerks into a character-based electronic document corresponding to the document image.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 5A and 5B, which, taken together, is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method of Figs. 5 A and 5B is similar to the method of Figs. 2A and 2B except as is now noted. As in the method of Figs. 2A and 2B computer 102 or 106 decomposes each image into one or more data entry region sub-images using conventional techniques, where each sub-image includes a recognition element. However, each sub-image is then subject to conventional OCR processing. Computer 102 then provides each sub-image to one or more available data entry clerks at one or more computers 100. The data entry clerk then views the sub-image, keys in a data entry value from the characters appearing in the recognition element of the sub-image, and transmits the data entry value to computer 102. Computer 102 then compares the OCR value for each sub-image with the data entry value for the same sub-image. Computer 102 then collates those data entry values and OCR values that have been "validated," i.e., where the values are the same, into a character-based electronic document corresponding to the docurrent image. Where the data entry value and the OCR value for a sub-image differ, computer 102 provides the sub-image to at least one other available data entry clerk at computer 100 to whom the sub-image was not previously provided. As before, the data entry clerk then views the sub-image, keys in a data entry value from the characters appearing in the recognition element of the sub-image, and transmits the data entry value to computer 102. Computer 102 then compares the OCR value for the sub-image with each of the data entry values for the same sub-image. If a predetermined number of the values are the same, the matching result is considered to be the verified result, which computer 102 then collates as indicated above. Alternatively, computer 102 then compares each of the data entry values for the same sub-image, and considers a value to be verified only if a predetermined number of data entry values are the same.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   The method of Fig. 6 may be used in<br>
conjunction with any of the methods described herein. In the method of Fig. 6, computer 102 provides a sub-image to one or more available data entry clerks at one or more computers 100. The data entry clerk then views the sub-image, and, if the sub-image is unclear, the data entry clerk may send to computer 102 an indicator associated with the sub-image rejecting the sub-image, whereupon computer 102 may send to the data entry clerk an expanded data entry region sub-image that includes said rejected data entry region sub-image. The expanded sub-image may include more area of the document image and/or may be magnified using conventional techniques.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 7, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary mode of operation of the architecture of Fig. 1, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method of Fig. 7 may be used in conjunction with any of the methods described herein. In the method of Fig. 7 a data entry clerk is given a performance rating using any known rating technique. The rating may be based on past performance and/or based on performance given a predefined set of training images whose values are known. When selecting a data entry clerk for work on a particular job, only those data entry clerks whose performance rating equals or exceeds a performance rating specified by the system administrator or by the customer in a work order may be selected to work on the job. Similarly, as is shown with particular reference to Fig. 8, when selecting a data entry clerk for work on a particular job, only those data entry clerks who have been pre-approved by the system administrator or by the customer, such as by specifically identifying the clerk or by pre-approving clerks according to specific attributes such as, but not limited to, qualification level, geographic location, or organizational association, may be selected to work on the job.<br>
It is appreciated that one or more of the steps of any of the methods described herein may be omitted or carried out in a different order than that shown, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more specific embodiments, the description is intended to be illustrative of the invention as a whole and is not to be construed as limiting the invention to the embodiments shown. It is appreciated that various modifications may occur to those skilled in the art that, while not specifically shown herein, are nevertheless within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
