				<td>SQUEEZE FOAMER<br>
The present invention relates to a dispensing device for dispensing<br>
a foam and a foam-forming assembly for forming a foam. More in<br>
particular, the present invention relates to a pumpless squeeze<br>
foamer.<br>
US 5,037,006 discloses a dispensing device for dispensing a foam.<br>
This known dispensing device comprises a manually compressible<br>
container for storing a liquid and air. The container comprises an<br>
opening in which a housing is fitted. In this housing, a liquid<br>
passage and an air passage are arranged which, during dispensing,<br>
are in communication with a dispensing passage which ends in a<br>
dispensing opening. The dispensing device furthermore comprises a<br>
valve body which, in a rest position, seals a mouth of the liquid<br>
passage and a mouth of the air passage. The valve body is a disc-<br>
shaped flexible element which is held at the circumference and is<br>
pressed against the mouths of the liquid passage and the air passage<br>
by means of a spring.<br>
By compressing/squeezing the container, the pressure in the<br>
container is increased and thus the pressure in the liquid passage<br>
and the air passage. As a result of this elevated pressure, the<br>
valve body on the mouths of the air passage and the liquid passage<br>
gives way, and a stream of air from the air passage and a stream of<br>
liquid from the liquid passage come together in the dispensing<br>
passage. In the dispensing passage, the mixture of liquid and air is<br>
passed through a number of sieves in order to create a foam which is<br>
dispensed by the dispensing opening.<br>
After the container has been squeezed, the container will<br>
essentially return to its original state, either by the elasticity<br>
of the container itself or by restoring means which are provided in<br>
order to return the container to its original state.<br>
A drawback of the known dispensing device is the fact that the<br>
mixture of air and liquid is not optimum as a result of which the<br><br>
quality of the foam is not satisfactory. In addition, the structure<br>
of the known dispensing device is complex and comprises many<br>
components, which makes production complicated. In addition, the air<br>
passage and the liquid passage are bendy, as a result of which the<br>
speed of the liquid and air stream decreases, which consequently<br>
also leads to a reduction in the quality of the foam.<br>
Another drawback of the known dispensing device is that the ratio<br>
air/liquid between the quantities of air and liquid, which are<br>
dispensed by squeezing of the container, respectively, is fixed. For<br>
each desired air/liquid ratio a separate dispensing device has to be<br>
designed which is especially adapted for this ratio.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a dispensing<br>
device for dispensing a foam which solves one or more of the<br>
abovementioned drawbacks.<br>
The present invention provides a dispensing device which is<br>
characterized in that the housing comprises a first housing part and<br>
a second housing part, the first and the second housing parts being<br>
mountable in several position with respect to each other, the ratio<br>
between the amounts of liquid and air to be dispensed upon<br>
compressing the container being dependent on the position in which<br>
the first and second housing parts are mounted with respect to each<br>
other.<br>
By providing a first housing part and a second housing part which<br>
can be mounted in different positions with respect to each other, it<br>
is possible to use the same parts to obtain different ratios between<br>
the amounts of air and liquid being dispensed when squeezing the<br>
container. This has the advantage that without the requirement of<br>
additional parts, the dispensing device can be made suitable for<br>
foaming foamable liquids with a desired quality, for instance a<br>
certain homogeneity and/or fineness of the foam. The ratio<br>
air/liquid required for a certain foam quality can also depend on<br>
the type of foamable liquid which is to be formed into a foam.<br>
The air/liquid ratio, i.e. the ratio between the amount of air and<br>
the amount of liquid which is dispensed upon depressing/squeezing<br><br>
the container, may be influenced by making the amount of air, the<br>
amount of liquid or a combination thereof, which is dispensed upon<br>
operating the dispenser, dependent on the position in which the<br>
first housing part is arranged with respect to the second housing<br>
part.<br>
In one embodiment, the first housing part comprises a plurality of<br>
openings, the openings being a part of the liquid passage, the<br>
second housing part, dependent on its position with respect to the<br>
first housing part blocks one or more of the plurality of openings.<br>
In this way a easily adaptable assembly of first and second housing<br>
part is provided with which different ratios between air and liquid<br>
can be set.<br>
In one embodiment, the first housing part comprises a plurality of<br>
openings arranged substantially equidistantly on a circle, and in<br>
which the second housing part comprises one or more openings and one<br>
or more blockages, the one or more openings and one or more<br>
blockages after assembly being aligned with the plurality of<br>
openings of the first housing part. In such embodiment the ratio<br>
between air and liquid to be dispensed upon operation of the<br>
dispenser, may be set by the angle with which the first housing part<br>
and the second housing part are mounted with respect to each other.<br>
In one embodiment, after assembly, the plurality of openings of the<br>
first housing part are sealingly fitted in the one or more openings<br>
and blockages of the second housing part, respectively. In such<br>
embodiment no liquid can flow between the first housing part and teh<br>
second housing part. As a consequence, it is possible to use the<br>
space between the first housing part and the second housing part to<br>
aerate the container without it being required that the air flows<br>
through the liquid in the container.<br>
In one embodiment, the first housing part comprises a plurality of<br>
openings, of which at least two have a different size. By varying<br>
the size of the openings in the first housing, for instance by<br>
providing three large and three small openings, the quantity of<br>
liquid dispensed by depressing the container can be set. This may be<br>
carried out by blocking one or more of the plurality of openings.<br><br>
For instance, it is possible to block all three large openings or<br>
all three small openings. Also, it is possible to block, or not<br>
block, combinations of large and small openings.<br>
In one embodiment, the mouth of the air passage and the mouth of the<br>
liquid passage are substantially annular and are arranged<br>
substantially concentrically with respect to one another.<br>
By making the mouth of the air passage and the liquid passage of<br>
annular design, the amount of liquid to be dispensed and air to be<br>
mixed with the latter is distributed over as large a surface area as<br>
possible. As the two annular mouths are arranged substantially<br>
concentrically with respect to one another, an improved mixture<br>
between the liquid and the air stream is obtained.<br>
In this	respect it is remarked that the annular mouth of the liquid<br>
passage	and/or air passage may be formed by one substantially<br>
annular	mouth or by a number of openings which are arranged in a<br>
circle.<br>
In one embodiment/ the diameter of the annular mouth of the liquid<br>
passage is greater than the diameter of the annular mouth of the air<br>
passage. As a result thereof, the liquid which flows from the<br>
annular mouth of the liquid passage will flow past the annular mouth<br>
of the air passage when the container is being squeezed and a good<br>
mixture will be achieved.<br>
In one embodiment, the valve body is substantially conical. The term<br>
conical is understood to mean that the valve body is of<br>
substantially circular-symmetrical design and that, in the direction<br>
of the centre axis of symmetry, the diameter is greater at one end<br>
of the valve body than at the other end of the valve body. The<br>
diameter may become increasingly smaller over the entire length, but<br>
may also increase or remain constant over part of the length of the<br>
conical shape.<br>
In one embodiment, the valve body is at least partly made from a<br>
flexible, preferably elastic, material, for example silicone. By<br>
manufacturing the valve body from a flexible material, there is no<br><br>
need to Install any further moving components in the dispensing<br>
device in order to provide the valve function of the valve body. By<br>
using an elastic material, the valve body will return to its rest<br>
position after a foam has been dispensed as a result of the<br>
container having been squeezed. However, this return movement may<br>
also be effected in any other suitable way, for example by using a<br>
spring element or by pretensioning the valve body.<br>
In one embodiment, the housing is substantially circular-symmetrical<br>
about a centr.e axis and/or the liquid to be dispensed, during<br>
dispensing, moves in a direction relative to the longitudinal<br>
direction of the housing. In such an embodiment, the liquid does not<br>
have to follow complicated flow paths in which the main direction of<br>
the liquid is reversed two times or more. This also allows a<br>
relatively simple construction of the dispensing device.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for manufacturing a a<br>
squeeze foamer as claimed in claim 14.<br>
The foam-forming assembly according to the invention may<br>
advantageously be applied in a squeeze foamer comprising a manually<br>
compressible container for storing a liquid and air, the foam-<br>
forming assembly mountable on or in an opening of said container.<br>
In alternative embodiments of dispensing devices for dispensing a<br>
foam, a foam-forming assembly according to the invention may be<br>
arranged in or on a container holding a liquid and gas under<br>
pressure, for instance on a container with a foamable liquid and a<br>
propellant. Also, the foam-forming assembly may be combined with any<br>
other device which can provide a foamable liquid and gas under<br>
pressure, for instance a device having a liquid pump and a air pump<br>
or a device having a liquid supply and air supply which are<br>
continuously under pressure.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below by means of an<br>
exemplary embodiment in which reference will be made to the attached<br>
drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. la shows a cross section of an embodiment of a dispensing<br><br>
device according to the inventi on;<br>
Fig. lb shows a cross section of the housing of Fig. la;<br>
Fig. lc shows a part of Fig. lb in more detail;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a top view of the first housing part of the embodiment<br>
from Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a top view of the third housing part of the embodiment<br>
from Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 (i.e. Figs, la, lb and lc) show a first embodiment of a<br>
dispensing device according to the invention. The dispensing device<br>
is denoted overall by reference numeral 1. The dispensing device 1<br>
is of the squeeze foamer type. Such a squeeze foamer dispenses a<br>
foam through a dispensing opening as a result of a container being<br>
squeezed. After it has been squeezed, the container will return to<br>
the original state, either by the elasticity of the container itself<br>
or by restoring means which are provided in order to return the<br>
container to its original state.<br>
The foam which can be formed using the dispensing device 1 may be<br>
suitable for various different uses, such as, for example, as soap, .<br>
shampoo, shaving foam, washing-up liquid, sun-tan lotion, after-sun<br>
lotion, washing liquid, skincare products and the like.<br>
The dispensing device is shown in the rest position, that is to say<br>
that the container is not being squeezed. Such a squeeze foamer can<br>
be operated by hand. However, it is also possible to push the<br>
container in using a device intended for the purpose.<br>
The illustrated squeeze foamer can be held in a hand during<br>
delivery. It is also possible to install it or a similar dispensing<br>
device into a holder which is to be attached, for example, to the<br>
wall, similar to holder which can, for example, be found in public<br>
toilets.<br>
The dispensing device 1 comprises a manually compressible container<br>
2 containing a liquid and air. The container has an opening 3 in<br>
which a foam-forming assembly is fitted. The container 2 may have<br>
any suitable shape, for example a shape having an elliptical or a<br>
circular cross section.<br><br>
The foam-forming assembly is substantially circular-symmetrical<br>
around a centre axis of symmetry A-A. The foam-forming assembly<br>
comprises a housing with a first housing part 4, a second housing<br>
part 20 and a third housing part 5. The third housing part 5 is<br>
attached to the container 2 by means of a threaded connection, the<br>
first housing part 4 and the second housing part 20 being clamped in<br>
a sealing manner between the container 2 and the third housing part<br>
5. Alternatively, the third housing part 5 may be attached by means<br>
of a snap connection, a welded connection, an airtight seal or<br>
another suitable connection on or in the container 2. Furthermore,<br>
the foam-forming assembly comprises a substantially conical valve<br>
body 6 which is clamped near clamping section 6a between the second<br>
housing part 20 and the third housing part 5. The valve body 6 is<br>
made from a flexible, preferably elastic material. Silicone has<br>
proved to be a particularly suitable material for the valve body 6.<br>
Relative to the liquid, the air is situated at the top of the<br>
container 2. This liquid and this air can be turned into a foam by<br>
means of the dispensing device 1, which foam is dispensed through a<br>
dispensing opening 8 in the sealing cap 7. In order to make mixing<br>
of the liquid and the air possible, a liquid passage is provided<br>
which runs from the liquid in the container via a plurality of<br>
openings 9a and 9b (see also Fig. 2) in the first housing part 4 to<br>
an annular mouth 10 (between the circular edges 4a and 4b) of the<br>
liquid passage.<br>
For the air, an air passage is provided which runs from the air at<br>
the top of the container 2 via the tube 11 to an annular mouth 12<br>
(between the circular edges 4a and 4c) of the air passage. In the<br>
rest position shown, both the annular mouth 10 and the annular mouth<br>
12 are sealed by the valve body 6. When the two annular mouths 10,<br>
12 are opened, that is to say not sealed by the valve body 6, the<br>
liquid passage and air passage are in communication with a<br>
dispensing passage. The dispensing passage runs through the central<br>
part of the valve body 6, in which a first sieve element 13 with two<br>
sieves 13a is arranged, through a central opening 14 of the valve<br>
body 6, through the third housing part 5 and the sealing cap 7 to<br>
the dispensing opening 8.<br><br>
Generally, the air passage contains one or more air ducts which<br>
bring the air in the container in fluid communication with a mouth<br>
of the air passage which, in the rest position, is covered by the<br>
valve body. The liquid passage correspondingly contains one or more<br>
liquid ducts which bring the liquid in the container in fluid<br>
communication with the mouth of the liquid passage which, in the<br>
rest position, is covered by the valve body.<br>
The annular mouth 10 of the liquid passage, the annular mouth 12 of<br>
the air passage and the dispensing passage are arranged<br>
substantially concentrically with respect to one another. The<br>
diameter of the annular mouth 10 is in this case larger than the<br>
annular mouth 12. Furthermore, the inner diameter of the central<br>
passage 14 in the valve body 6 is smaller than the diameter of each<br>
of the annular mouths 10 and 12.<br>
Now, the valve body 6 will be discussed in more detail, At the point<br>
6a, the valve body 6 is sealingly clamped between the second housing<br>
part 20 and the third housing part 5. Furthermore, the valve body is<br>
retained by the annular edges 4a and 4c against the conical surface<br>
5a. In order, in the rest position, to achieve a better sealing<br>
along the circular edges 4a and 4c, the valve body 6 is fitted with<br>
some axial pretension between the second housing part 20 and the<br>
third housing part 5.<br>
The valve body 6 has an arcuate section 6c which is located, at<br>
least partly, in the annular mouth 10 of the liquid passage. This<br>
arcuate section 6c has the advantage that, as a result of the liquid<br>
column in the container and the liquid passage which, in the rest<br>
position, presses on the valve body, an improved sealing is obtained<br>
at point 4a. This is due to the fact that the arcuate section 6c is<br>
pushed in, as a result of which the sides of the arch are pushed<br>
sideways. As a result, the outside of the arcuate section 6c is<br>
pushed towards the clamp 6a, and the inside of the arcuate section<br>
6c is pushed against the circular edge 4a as well as against the<br>
circular edge 4c, which increases the sealing action.<br>
In this case, it is particularly advantageous that the cross section<br><br>
of the arcuate section 6c which extends inside the annular mouth 10<br>
is not of a symmetrical design, but that a top of the arcuate<br>
section 6c is situated relatively close to the edge 4a, i.e. that<br>
the top of the arcuate section 6c is closer to the edge la than to<br>
the edge 4b. As a result of this shape, the arcuate section 6c will,<br>
under the pressure of the liquid column, in particular press against<br>
the edge 4c, resulting in a good sealing here. As the annular mouth<br>
10 is sealed on the other side by the clamp at section 6a, the mouth<br>
is efficiently sealed off by the valve body without a great clamping<br>
force being required.<br>
In an alternative embodiment in which the valve body 6 is not<br>
clamped to one of the sides of the mouth, a top can be provided near<br>
both edges of the mouth in order to achieve the advantageous very<br>
strong clamping effect of the arcuate section of the valve body on<br>
both edges. The cross section of the arcuate section of the valve<br>
body then resembles the back of a 2-humped camel, the two tops of<br>
the valve body representing the humps of the camel.<br>
On the side situated on the outside of the clamping section 6a, the<br>
valve body 6 has a sealing lip 6b which serves as a valve for an air<br>
inlet valve which allows air into the container 2 when a certain<br>
"reduced pressure is created in the container 2 as a result of the<br>
liquid in the container 2 being dispensed. The sealing lip 6b<br>
normally seals the passage of the container 2 towards the outside,<br>
but will allow a flow of air from outside into the bontainer 2<br>
through the opening 15 when there is a reduced pressure in the<br>
container 2.<br>
The dispensing device 1 furthermore comprises a sealling cap 7.<br>
Relative to the third housing part 5, this sealing cap 7 can be<br>
moved at least between an open position, as shown in Figjs. 1 and 2,<br>
and a closed position (towards the top in the drawing, relative to<br>
the housing). In the closed position, a projecting section 5b of the<br>
third housing part 5 is moved into the dispensing opening 8 so that<br>
no foam can be dispensed through the dispensing opening 8. The air<br>
inlet passage which, via the valve body 6b and the opening 15, leads<br>
to the interior of the container 2, is sealed when the sealing cap<br>
is. placed in the closed position. The sealing cap 7 still has a<br><br>
number of upwardly pointing fingers which engage with complementary<br>
fingers on the third housing part 5. These intermating fingers form<br>
further sealings in the closed position.<br>
Near its outer periphery, the first housing part 4 has a free<br>
projecting lip which extends obliquely in the direction of the<br>
container 2 and inwards (towards the centre line A-A) . This lip 29<br>
serves as a sealing element for sealing the connection oetween the<br>
first housing part 4 and the container 2. Such a sealing is also<br>
known as a crab claw, but has not yet been used in a foam-dispensing<br>
device, in particular not in a squeeze foamer.<br>
When the container 2 is squeezed in the open position of the sealing<br>
cap, the pressure in the container 2 will increase. Initially, the<br>
increasing pressure will ensure that the arcuate sectior. 6c of the<br>
valve body 6 is pressed more strongly against the annular edge 4a,<br>
resulting in an improved sealing between the valve body 6 and the<br>
annular edge 4a. When the pressure in the container 2 is increased<br>
further by squeezing the latter, the arcuate section 6c will at some<br>
point move down, as a result of which it will detach from the<br>
annular edge 4a. This will lead to a stream of liquid flowing<br>
through the gap between the annular edge 4a and the valve body 6. As<br>
a result of the increasing pressure in the container 2, the valve<br>
body 6 will subsequently also become detached from the annular edge<br>
4c, making it possible for air and the stream of liquid to flow<br>
between the annular edge 4c and the valve body 6. Here, the liquid<br>
will thus be mixed with the air. Since both the liquid and the air<br>
will flow through a narrow circular gap, a good mixture between the<br>
air and the liquid will result. This mixture of air and Liquid will<br>
then flow through the small sieves 13a, 28a, which will produce a(n<br>
improved) foam. This foam will flow down through the dispensing<br>
passage towards the dispensing opening, where it will be dispensed.<br>
The valve body 6 thus as it were successively rolls over the annular<br>
edges 4a and 4c during dispensing as a result of which the liquid<br>
and air can flow via the dispensing passage to the dispensing<br>
opening, creating a foam in the dispensing passage, it has been<br>
found that this rolling effect is advantageous for forming a foam.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a top view of the first housing part 4. This first<br>
housing part 4 is substantially disc shaped and comprises a central<br>
opening 23 surrounded by six openings, three openings 9a having a<br>
larger diameter than the other three openings 9b. While foam is<br>
being dispensed and also during aeration of the container 2, air<br>
will flow through the central opening 23. Depending on the desired<br>
air/liquid ratio, one or more of the openings 9a and 9b are provided<br>
in order to allow liquid to flow through them while the squeeze<br>
foamer is being operated.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a top view of the second housing part 20. This second<br>
housing part 20 comprises three openings 24 which can be brought in<br>
line with either the large openings 9a or the small openings 9b of<br>
the first housing part 4, depending on the position of rotation in<br>
which the second housing part 20 is placed on the first housing part<br>
4. The second housing part 20 furthermore comprises three blind<br>
holes 25 which, depending on the position of the first housing part<br>
4 relative to the second housing part 20, will either seal the large<br>
openings 9a or the small openings 9b.<br>
Fig. 1 clearly shows, on the left-hand side, that the sleeve 4e of<br>
the first housing part 4, in which the opening 9a is provided, is<br>
positioned in the sleeve, in which the opening 24 is provided, while<br>
the sleeve 4f, shown on the right-hand side in the figure, in which<br>
the opening 9b is provided, is sealed by the blind hole 25. During<br>
operation of the squeeze foamer 1, the liquid will therefore only<br>
flow through the three large openings 9a.<br>
If the first housing part 4 and the second housing part 20 were now<br>
to be rotated 60 degrees with respect to one another, the openings<br>
24 would be lined up with the small openings 9b, while: the large<br>
openings 9a would be sealed by the blind holes 25. This would result<br>
in less liquid flowing from the openings 9b during operation of the<br>
squeeze foamer, whereas the amount of air which flows through the<br>
riser 11 as a result of the container 2 being squeezed would remain<br>
virtually the same. Thus, the air/liquid ratio will change depending<br>
on the position of rotation of the first housing part 4 relative to<br>
the second housing part 20.<br><br>
It will be clear to the person skilled in the art that . this<br>
construction offers many possibilities for changing the air/liquid<br>
ratio by varying the number of openings in the first housing part<br>
which are optionally sealed by a blind hole as well as by varying<br>
the size of the respective openings.<br>
A further possibility to influence the air/liquid ratio is through<br>
the adjustment of the smallest diameter of the air passage, for<br>
example by adjusting the inner diameter of the riser 11 or by<br>
adjusting the diameter of the central opening 23 in the first<br>
housing part 4. The options which have been given for adjusting the<br>
air/liquid ratio can also be used to affect the total amount of foam<br>
which is formed when the container 2 is squeezed.<br>
In the present embodiment of Fig. 1, only two positions are<br>
possible: one as shown in Fig. 1, where the liquid is dispensed<br>
through the three large openings 9a, and a position in which the<br>
first housing part 4 is rotated by 60 degrees relative to the second<br>
housing part 20 and in which the liquid is thus dispensed through<br>
the three small openings 9b. When fitting the various components of<br>
the squeeze foamer 1 onto the container 2, a choice will be made<br>
regarding the position in which the first housing part 4 would be<br>
fitted with respect to the second housing part 20, for example<br>
depending on the liquid.<br>
The second housing part 20 is clamped between the clamping section<br>
6a on the valve body 6 and the first housing part 4. In this<br>
embodiment, the valve body 6 is thus clamped between the second<br>
housing part 20 and the third housing part 5. The first housing part<br>
4 comprises sleeves 4e/4f, in which the openings 9a and 9b,<br>
respectively, are provided. These sleeves 4e/4f are placed in an<br>
opening 24 of the second housing part 20 in a sealing manner.<br>
The liquid which flows through the opening 9a to the annular mouth<br>
10 is thus not able to reach a space 21 which is situated between<br>
the first housing part 4 and the second housing part 20. This space<br>
21 connects the space 22 just above the air inlet valve 6b to the<br>
interior of the riser 11. As a result, the air which enters through<br>
the air inlet valve 6b during aeration of the container 2 following<br><br>
the dispensing of a certain amount of liquid, will successively flow<br>
through the spaces 22 and 21 and through the riser 11 into the top<br>
section of the container 2. Herewith, the air is prevented from<br>
passing through the liquid in the container 2 prior to the aeration<br>
i of the container 2 to avoid that a foam may already be formed in the<br>
container 2 as the air required for aerating the bottle flows<br>
through the liquid.<br>
By forming a space 21 using the second housing part 20,  the<br>
i  production of foam in the container 2 during aeration is thus<br>
prevented in a constructionally simple manner.<br>
Fig. 3 furthermore shows that the central section and the outer<br>
section of the second housing part 20 are connected to pne another<br>
i by bridge parts 26. These bridge parts 26 result in the mouth 12<br>
being formed by three openings, which openings are arranged in a<br>
ring shape. Such an embodiment of the mouth 12 with several openings<br>
is deemed to be a substantially annular mouth as referred to in the<br>
context of the present patent application.<br>
)<br>
In the embodiments from Fig. 1 a second sieve element 28 comprising<br>
two small sieves 28a is provided. Depending on the foam to be formed<br>
and the liquid which is used for this purpose, this second sieve<br>
element 28 may be used to further affect the quality of the foam to<br>
i be dispensed. In general, the provision of additional sieve elements<br>
will result in the foam becoming more refined and also more<br>
homogeneous. Depending on the application, it is thus possible to<br>
choose one of the sieve elements 13, 28 or the combination thereof,<br>
it also being possible to modify the type of small sieve which is<br>
I used in the respective sieve elements 13, 28 to suit the<br>
application. In an alternative embodiment, the sieve elements 13, 28<br>
can also be designed as a single sieve element, half of this single<br>
sieve element extending into the valve body.<br>
&gt; In one possible embodiment, one of the small sieves is replaced by a<br>
small plate having one or more relatively small holes, giving the<br>
sieve element the function of an expansion space.<br>
A further advantage of the embodiment of the dispensing device 1 is<br><br>
that the annular mouths of the liquid passage and the air passage<br>
distribute the liquid and the air over a relatively large surface<br>
area, resulting in a relatively good mixing. This advantage may also<br>
achieved when one or both of the annular mouths extend over less<br>
than 360 degrees or are subdivided into several openings which<br>
together form an interrupted annular opening. Such embcdiments are<br>
considered to fall within the scope of protection of the invention.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, it is possible to design the valve<br>
body to be stiff and to press or pull it against the second housing<br>
part 20 using a spring element. When the pressure in the container<br>
is increased, the spring will then be compressed or extended,<br>
respectively, creating a gap between the valve body 6 and the second<br>
housing part 20. As a result, it will be possible to form and to<br>
dispense a foam. However, in such an embodiment the advantageous<br>
rolling effect described above will not occur.<br>
Another advantage of the embodiment of the dispensing device 1 is<br>
that as a result of the central opening 14 which is provided in the<br>
valve body, the stream of liquid and/or the stream of air does not<br>
have to turn corners of 90 degrees or more. By providing this<br>
opening 14, the stream of liquid and the stream of air can maintain<br>
their speed, thus resulting in a better mixture of the liquid and<br>
the air. In this case, it is furthermore advantageous that the valve<br>
body 6 is designed to be substantially conical as a result of which<br>
the speed of the stream of liquid and the stream of air is<br>
maintained even more effectively. In addition, the conical shape has<br>
the advantage that a sieve element assisting the production of foam<br>
can be fitted in the cone. By fitting it in the conical shape, the<br>
total height of the housing is reduced, Generally, the illustrated<br>
embodiment of the dispensing device has the advantage that the<br>
liquid to be dispensed moves in a direction relative to the<br>
direction of the centre axis of symmetry while it is being<br>
dispensed. This is made possible by the specific construction of the<br>
dispensing device and aids the production of a foam of the desired<br>
quality.<br>
Yet another advantage of the embodiment of the dispensing device 1<br>
is that the arcuate section 6c of the valve body 6 supports the<br><br>
sealing between the second housing part 20 and the valve body 6. As<br>
a result, a better sealing is achieved in the rest position, i.e.<br>
when the container 2 is not being squeezed, thus reducing the risk<br>
of liquid leaking from the dispensing device. In addition, the<br>
arcuate section 6c creates a pressure threshold value, at which the<br>
valve body becomes detached from the second housing part 20,<br>
ensuring an improved foam of constant quality.<br>
The above-described embodiments of a squeeze foamer have been<br>
described in a position where the cap points downwards. All<br>
references to above and/or below are made relative to this position.<br>
The dispensing device is designed to be used in this position. In<br>
this case, the sealing cap 7 is designed such that the dispensing<br>
device can stand on this sealing cap 7, whereas the container 2, due<br>
to its convex top, is not suitable to stand on this top. However, it<br>
is possible to provide an embodiment in which the dispensing device<br>
can indeed be turned upside down (inverted with respect to the<br>
position shown) in order to dispense foam and/or rest. Such<br>
embodiments are deemed to fall within the scope of protection of<br>
this invention.<br>
It will be clear to the person skilled in the art that all<br>
individual features which have been mentioned with respect to one of<br>
the aspects can also be applied in an embodiment according to one of<br>
the other aspects of the invention. Such embodiments are thus deemed<br>
to fall within the scope of protection of the invention.<br><br>
