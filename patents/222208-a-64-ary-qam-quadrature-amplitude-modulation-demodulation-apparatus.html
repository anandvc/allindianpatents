				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a 64-ary QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) demodulation apparatus and method for a data communication system employing multi-level modulation, and in particulars, to an apparatus and method for calculating an input value to a channel decoder in a demodulator for a data communication system employing 64-ary QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
In general, a data communication system employs multi-level modulation in order to increase spectral efficiency. The multi-level modulation includes various modulation techniques. Herein, reference will be made to 64-ary QAM, one of the multi-level modulation techniques. As known by those skilled in the art, a 64-ary QAM channel encoder modulates a signal coded by binary encoding and transmits the coded signal to a receiver. The receiver then receives the transmitted modulated signal and decodes the modulated signal through soft decision values decoding in a channel decoder. To perform the decoding, a demodulator of the receiver includes a mapping algorithm for generating soft decision values (or soft values), because the received modulated signal is comprised of an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component. Therefore, the demodulator of the receiver includes a mapping algorithm for generating soft decision values each corresponding to output bits of the channel encoder from a 2-diensional received signal.<br>
The mapping algorithm is classified into a simple metric procedure proposed by Nokia, and a dual minimum metric procedure proposed by Motorola. Both algorithms calculate LLR (Log Likelihood Ratio) values for the output bits and use the calculated LLR values as input soft decision values to the channel decoder.<br>
The simple metric procedure, which employs a mapping algorithm given by modifying a complex LLR calculation formula into a simple approximate formula, has a simple LLR calculation formula. However, LLR distortion caused by the use of the approximate formula leads to performance degradation. The dual minimum metric procedure, which employs a mapping algorithm of calculating LLR with a more accurate approximate formula and uses the calculated LLR as an input soft decision value of the channel decoder, can make up for performance degradation of the simple metric procedure to some extent. However, compared with the simple metric procedure, this procedure needs increased calculations, thus causing a considerable increase in hardware complexity.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a signal constellation for 64-ary QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation);<br>
In Equation (1), sk.i (i=0,l,—,m-l) indicates an ith bit in the output sequence of the binary channel encoder, mapped to a kth symbol, and Ik and Qk indicate an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of the kth symbol, respectively.

In Equation (3), k is a constant, and Pr(A|B}  indicates a conditional<br>
probability defined as a probability that an event A will occur when an event B occurs. However, since Equation (3) is non-linear and accompanies relatively many calculations, an algorithm capable of approximating Equation (3) is required for actual realization.

For the sake of convenience, 7 boundary values, that is. result values at Yk = -6a, Yk = -4a, Yk = -2a. Yk - 0, Yk = 2a, Y. = 4a and Y,. = 6a, are omitted from Table 1. Where "a"" means a distance value on the same axis and the ""a" indicating a distance value, can have a different value according to a modulating/demodulating method. Table 2 illustrates (%,, nk s, nk0) and Uk for the case where an in-phase signal component Xk of the received signal R,. appears in each of 8 regions parallel to a vertical axis in FIG. 1. For the sake of convenience, 7 boundary values, that is, result values at Xk = -6a, Xk = -4a, Xk = -2a, Xk = 0, Xk = 2a, Xk = 4a and Xk = 6a, are omitted from Table 2.<br>

Table 4 (Table Removed)   Table 6  and Table 7 (Table Removed)   <br>
 illustrate results given by down-scaling, in a ratio of<br><br>
K"x4a, input soft decision values of the channel decoder obtained by substituting Vk and UVl of Table 4 and Table 5 into Equation (8).<br>
(Table Removed)   <br>
That is, when a received signal R,. is applied, LLR satisfying a corresponding condition can be output as an input soft decision value by Table 6 and Table 7. If the channel decoder used in the system is not a max-logMAP (logarithmic maximum a posteriori) decoder, a process of up-scaling the LLR of Table 6 and Table 7 in a reverse ratio of the down-scale ratio must be added.<br>
However, when outputting an input soft decision value of the channel decoder using the mapping table of Table 6 or Table 7, the demodulator should perform an operation of deciding a condition of the received signal and require a memory for storing the output contents according to the corresponding condition. This can be avoided by calculating the input soft decision values to the channel decoder using a formula having a simple condition decision operation instead of the mapping table.<br>
To this end, the condition decision formulas shown in Table 6 and Table 7<br>
can be expressed as shown in Table 8 and Table 9.<br>
Table 8  (Table Removed)   <br>
In Table 8, Zlk= I Yk I -4a and Z2k= I Zlk I -2a, and in Table 9, Z"lk=|Xkl -4a and Z"2k=|Z"lk|-2a. In Table 8 and Table 9, even the soft decision values at the 7 boundary values, which were omitted from Table 6 and Table 7 for convenience, are taken into consideration.<br>
In hardware realization, Table 8 and Table 9 can be simplified into Table 10 and Table 11 on condition that a sign of Xk,1 Y&amp; Zlk, Z^., Z"lk and Z"^ can be expressed by sign bits. Table 10 and Table 11 illustrate LLR values in terms of Yk, ZIk, Z^., and Xk, Z"lk, Z\, respectively.<br>

That is, in the data communication system employing 64-ary QAM, it is possible to actually calculate 6 soft decision values, which are outputs of the demodulator for one received signal and inputs of the channel decoder, using the dual minimum metric procedure of Equation (4), through the simple conditional formulas of Equation (9) to Equation (14). This process is illustrated in FIGs. 2 and 3. FIGs. 2 and 3 illustrate an example of processes performed for calculating soft decision values according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, a process of calculating soft decision values (sM), (st4) and (st3)<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 2. In step 200, a demodulator determines whether an MSB value of a quadrature-phase signal component Yk is 0. As a result of the determination, if an MSB value of the quadrature-phase signal component Y;
Next, a process for calculating soft decision values (k, 2 ) (k,1) and (k, 0) will be described with reference to FIG. 3. In step 300, the demodulator determines whether an MSB value of an in-phase signal component Xk is 0. As a result of the determination, if an MSB value of the in-phase signal component Xk is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 304 and sets a value of a parameter c" to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 302 and sets a value of the parameter c" to -1. After determining a value of the parameter c", the demodulator sets a value of Z"lk to |Xk|-4a in step 306. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 308 whether MSB of the Zik determined in step 306 is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z!k is 0, me demodulator proceeds to step 312 and sets a value of a parameter a" to 3. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 310 and sets a value of the parameter a" to 0. After setting a value of the parameter a", the demodulator sets a value of Z"2k to |Z",k|-2a in step 314. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 316 whether MSB of the Z"^ is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z\k is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 320 and sets a value of a parameter (3" to 0. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 318 and sets a value of the parameter (3" to -1 and a value of a parameter y? to 0. After step<br>
320, the demodulator determines in step 322 whether MSB of the Z"!k is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z"lk is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 324 and sets a value of the parameter y" to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 326 and sets a value of the parameter y" to -1. Based on the determined values of the parameters α", ß", " and c" the demodulator calculates the soft decision values (sk2)., (sk1). and (sk3-0) in step 328.<br>
The process for calculating the soft decision values by the dual minimum metric procedure as described in conjunction with FIGs. 2 and 3 can be divided into (i) a first step of deteirnining the parameters α, ß  and c by analyzing the quadrature-phase signal component Yk and a value "a" and determining the parameters α,"β,γ", and c" by analyzing the in-phase signal component Xk and a value "a", and (ii) a second step of calculating soft decision values using a received signal and the parameters determined in the first step. This process can be realized by a block diagram illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram for calculating soft decision values using a quadrature-phase signal component Yk, an in-phase signal component Xk, and a value "a". The processes of FIGs. 2 and 3 will be described in brief with reference to FIG. 3. A quadrature-phase signal analyzer 410 determines parameters a, P, y and c using the quadrature-phase signal Yk and the value "a" through the process of FIG. 2. A first soft decision value output unit 420 calculates soft decision values (sk4), (st4) and (st3) using the determined parameters a, p, y and c. Similarly, an in-phase signal analyzer 430 determines parameters α,"β,γ", and c" using the in-phase signal Xk. and the value "a" through the process of FIG. 3. A second soft decision value output unit 440 calculates soft decision values (sk&gt;2), (k,1) and (sk,0) using the determined parameters α,"β,γ", andc".<br>

In this manner, the circuit of FIG. 6 can calculate the soft decision values (sk 2), (st!) and (sk-0) from the in-phase signal component Xk and the value "a". According to the foregoing description, a conventional soft decision value calculator using the dual minimum metric procedure realized by Equation (4) needs one hundred or more squaring operations and comparison operations. However, the calculators according to an embodiment of the present invention as exemplified in FIGs. 5 and 6 and realized using Equation (9) to Equation (14) are comprised of 10 adders (first to fourth operators are also realized by adders), 8 multipliers and 10 multiplexers, contributing to a remarkable reduction in operation time and complexity of the calculator. Table 12 below illustrates a comparison made between the conventional calculator realized by Equation (4) and the novel calculator realized by Equations (9) to (14) in terms of the type and number of operations, for ie {0,1,2,3,4, 5}.<br>
(Equation Removed)  <br>
(Table Removed)  <br>
In summary, the embodiment of the present invention described above derives Table 6 to Table 11 from Equation (6) to Equation (8) and the process of Table 1 to Table 5, in order to reduce a time delay and complexity, which may occur when Equation (4), the known dual minimum metric procedure, or Equation (5) obtained by simplifying the dual minimum metric procedure is actually realized using the 64-ary QAM. Further, the embodiment of the present invention provides Equation (9) to Equation (14), new formulas used to realize the dual minimum metric procedure in the 64-ary QAM. In addition, the present invention provides a hardware device realized based on Equation (9) and Equation (14).<br>
As described above, in deriving a soft decision value needed as an input of a channel decoder using the dual minimum metric procedure, the novel 64-ary QAM demodulator for a data communication system can perform simple and rapid calculations while obtaining the same result as when the exiting formula is used. A soft decision value calculator realized by hardware remarkably reduces an operation time and complexity of the demodulator.<br>
