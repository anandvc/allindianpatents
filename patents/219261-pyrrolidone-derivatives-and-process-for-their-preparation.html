It has been found that the compounds of general formula I and I* as well as individual \ isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof (hereinafter: Active Compounds) are / selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme lesponsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adienahne, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes [Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1988)] and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al., J. Neural. Transm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease [Dostert et al, Bio-chem. Pharmacol. 38:555-561 (1989)] and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques [Saura et al., Neuroscience 70:755-774 (1994)]. In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the.use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopa¬minergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO acti¬vity and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibi¬tors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br><br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by Bentue-Ferrer et al. [CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1996)]. Whereas a mapr limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications [Gardner et al., J. Clin, Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996)], these adverse events are of less concern with rever¬sible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-BThus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme)<br>

In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 comprising reacting a compound of formula II<br>
  (11)<br>
with an isocyanate or an acyl donating agent of formula Z-C(0)-(C1-C3)-alkyl, Z-C(O)-halogen-(C1-C3)alkyl, Z-C(O)O[C1-C3)-alkyl, or Z-SO2-(C1-C3)-alkyl wherein Z is an activating group, e.g. halogen or anhydride.<br>
Scheme I shows the main routes to compounds of the formula I. The intermediates III and IIIa may be reacted with itaconic acid IV neat at a temperature in the range of from 80C<br>
to aoo-c.<br>
The compounds of formula Va may be alkylated by Williamson-ether synthesis using an unsubstituted or substituted benzyl derivative selected from benzylic halides, tosylates, methane sulfonates (mesylates) and trifluoromethane sulfonates (triflates). Bases used can be, e.g. alcoholates or carbonates, like sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate. Preferred solvents are lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones at a temperature in the range of from 20'C and reflux temperature.<br>
Another approach is the Mitsunobu-coupling: an optionally substituted benzylic alcohol is reacted with a compound of formula Va in an inert solvent, e.g., diethyl ether or tetra-hydrofurane, using dialkyl-azo-dicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines, e.g., tributyl-or triphenyl-phosphine. The hydrolysis of compounds of formula Va can be performed by methods known per se like hydrolysis under acidic conditions, e.g. with hydrochloric acid, or basic conditions, e.g. lithium, sodium- or potassium hydroxide in mixtures of alcohols and water as the solvent.<br>
Compounds of formula II and IIa can be obtained starting from acid derivatives of formula V by nucleophilic migrations from a carbon to a nitrogen atom, such as e.g. by Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, via the formation of the corresponding isocyanate. Subsequent treatment of the isocyanate by aqueous acid direcdy yields amines of formula 11. Treatment of the intermediate isocyanate with suitable alcohols gives the protected amino derivatives of formula IIa. For the treatment of the isocyanate, alcohols are selected which yield the typical carbamates used as amine protecting groups, e.g. tert-butoxycarb-<br><br>
onyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, or fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl. Their cleavage to the amine to yield compounds of formula II follows the protocols which are well known from the hterature.<br>
The further transformation to compounds of formula II can he performed by standard procedures, such as e.g. by reaction with activated acyl derivatives, e.g. acyl haJogenides or anhydrides, or by condensation reactions of the acid using e.g. carbodiimides as conden¬sation reagent or by reaction with isocyanates.<br>
In compounds of formula I or Ila wherein-X-Y-has the meaning of ~CH2-0-, the optionally substituted benzyl residue can function as a transient group which can be cleaved by hydro gen olysis. The resulting compounds of formula Via or Vlb can then be re-aLkylated by a different benzyl group under the aforementioned conditions. As known to those skilled in the art, this process is only possible on condition that R   and PG (protecting group) are groups that are stable under the aforementioned reaction conditions for the hydrogenolysis and alkylation reaction.<br><br><br><br>
Another method to prepare compounds of formula I involves cross-coupling reactions of ar)istannanes [Lam et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 43:3091 (2002)], arylboronates [Lam et al., Synlett 5:674 (2000); Chan et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 39:2933 (1998)] or aryl halides [Buch-wald et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 118:7215 (1996)] with the corresponding pyrroHdones (scheme 2).<br><br>
wherein LG is a leaving group, e.g. halogen, e.g. CI, Br or I, or SnR3 or B(OH)2 and R^ is -NHR^ or alkoxycarbonyl.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a possibility to prepare compounds of general formula III wherein -X-Y- is -CH2-O-, i.e. compounds of formula Illb, is shown in scheme 3: The intermediates of formula XII are accessible through nucleophiiic substitution of aromatic nitro compounds of formula XI containing p-substituted leaving groups with benzylic alcohols of formula X. Examples for leaving groups in para-position are halogens (F, CI, Br, 1), tosylates, mesylates or triflates. These substitution reactions can be conducted neat or in inert solvents like for example toluene or xylene. A preferred reaction temperature is in. the range of from 50C to 150°C. Alternatively, compounds of formula XII can be prepared by Williamson-ether synthesis, starting from p-nltrophenols of formula XIV and benzylic halides, tosylates, mesylates or triflates of formula XIII. Bases used can be for example alcoholates or carbonates (sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate). Preferred solvents are lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones at a<br><br>
temperature in the range of from 20°C to reflux temperature. Another approach is the Mitsunobu-coupling of benzylic alcohols with p-nitrophenols of formula XIV. The reaction is done as usual in inert solvents like for example diethyl ether or tetraliydrofiirane, using dialkyl-azo-dicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines, e.g. tributyl- or triphenyl-phosphme.<br>
The key intermediates of formula XII are reduced to the amino-compounds IIIb using :atalytic hydrogenation, e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alcohols, ;thyl acetate or tetrahydrofurane. An alternative is the reduction of the nitro-group by metals like iron, tin, or zmc in acidic media like diluted hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. Metals can also be replaced by metal salts, e.g. tin-(II)-chloride.<br><br>
wherein LG is a leaving group, e.g. halogen, OTf, etc., and Y is a leaving group, e.g. tialogen, OTf, etc. or OH (for Mitsunobu-coupling),<br>
The intermediates of formula III wherein -X-Y- is -CH=CH-, i.e. compound of formula lllc. or wherein -X^Y- is -CH3-CH2-, i.e. compound of formula Illd, may be prepared by a procedure which is shown in scheme 4. The intermediates of formula XVII are accessible by olefination reaction of optionally substituted aromatic aldehydes of formula XV with dialkyl- (4-nitrobenzyl)-phosphonates of formula XVI in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydride, yielding the corresponding nitro-olefins of formula XVII.<br>
The key intermediates of formula XVII can be reduced selectively to the amino-olePn of formula IIIc by metals or metal salts, like e.g. tin-(II)-chloride or by catalytic hydro¬genation like e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofiirane as the solvent. The amino derivatives of formula Hid can be obtamed from the nitro derivatives of formula XVII or the amino-olefins of formula Ilk by<br><br>
hydrogenation using palladium on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofiirane as the solvent.<br>

Compounds of general formula I can also exist in optical pure form. Separation into anti¬podes can be affected according to methods known per se, either at an early stage of the synthesis starting with compounds of formula V by salt formation with an optically active amine such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-l-phenylethylamine or (+)- or (-)-l-naphthyl-ethylamine and separation of the diastereomeric salts by firactional crystallisation or by derivatisation with a chiral auxiliary substance such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-2-butanoI, (+)- or (-)-l-phenylethanQl, or (+)- or (-)-menthol and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallisation and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chjral auxiliary substance;or, on the very last stage, by separation of the enantiomers of formula I by chromatography on a chiral phase. Furthermore, compounds of formula 1 can also be obtained from enantiopure intermediates obtained by biotransformation, e.g. byhydrolysisof esters of formula Va by enzymes, such as e.g. cholesterase from Candida cylindracea. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the pyrrolidinone deriva¬tive obtained, the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives can be analysed by conventional spectroscopic methods, with X~ray spectroscopy on single crystals being an especially suit¬able method.<br>
The compounds of formula I are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhi¬bitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which 2vIAO-B inhibi¬tors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders ace for instance traumatic<br><br>
or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indica¬tions include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabohc disorders such as obesity, as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications may be peripheral neuropathy caused by can¬cer chemotherapy (WO 97/33,572), reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34,172), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (WO 96/40,095), and odier neuioinflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I are especially usefid for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNAs encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnoiogy 15:1-13 (1998)]. After transfection, ceRs were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Iris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 x g and, after two rinsing steps with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, mem¬branes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80°C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectro-photometric assay adapted from the mediod described by Zhou and Panchuk-Voloshina [Analytical Biochemistry 253:169-174 (1997)]. Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37'C containing different con¬centrations of the compounds. After this period, the en2;}'matic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and SO [M N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 μl and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 μM clorgyhne for MAO-A or 10 pM L-deprenyl for MAO-B. IC5D values were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of preferred compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 1 μM or less, typically 0.1 μM or less, and ideally 0.02 μM or less.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceu¬tical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emul¬sions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be processed with pharraaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, how¬ever, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the produc¬tion of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabi¬lizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound" of formula I and a therapeuti¬cally inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the pro¬duction of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being<br><br>
weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
