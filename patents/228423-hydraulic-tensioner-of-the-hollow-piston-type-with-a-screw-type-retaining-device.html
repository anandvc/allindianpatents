				<td>REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims an invention which was disclosed in EPC<br>
application number 02425131.6, filed March 7, 2002, entitled<br>
"HYDRAULIC PENSIONER OF THE HOLLOW PISTON TYPE WITH A<br>
SCREW-TYPE RETAINING DEVICE". The benefit under 35 USCÂ§119(a)<br>
of the EPC application is hereby claimed, and the aforementioned application<br>
is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to the field of devices for tensioning flexible<br>
drive transmission means, such as belts or chains. More particularly, the<br>
invention pertains to hydraulic tensioners. Reference will be made to<br>
transmission chains for internal combustion engines, such as are used to<br>
transmit motion from a first driving sprocket, operated directly or not by a<br>
vehicle engine, to one or more driven shafts, for example a cam shaft, fuel<br>
injection pump, or oil pump.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
For reasons of adjustment, wear on materials and take-up of slack, it is<br>
often necessary to compensate for a certain slack of the chain and this is done<br>
by means of shoe tensioners, in which a shoe is biased with adjustable force<br>
against a chain side.<br><br>
The bias on the shoe is normally obtained by a hydraulic<br>
tensioner. In its most widely known embodiment, a hydraulic tensioner<br>
comprises a cylinder-piston assembly. A stationary member (generally the<br>
cylinder) is mounted on the engine block, and a movable member (generally<br>
the piston) acts on the shoe under the action of a spring and hydraulic fluid,<br>
generally oil. In some known tensioners the piston is hollow and the piston<br>
chamber or bore receives a vent device sliding axially therein. The vent<br>
device has an end part that can be hemispherical or flat with a thin spiral<br>
groove on the face thereof facing toward the bottom of the piston, and the<br>
bottom of the piston has a through hole. The device is biased by the spring<br>
against the bottom of the piston and allows any air to exit or possibly oil to be<br>
discharged for lubrication purposes and to adjust the elastic-damping<br>
characteristics of the tensioner. The spring therefore acts between the<br>
cylinder and the disk and, through it, acts on the piston.<br>
Some tensioners include a so-called "no-return" device, able to prevent<br>
re-entry of the piston into the cylinder if the oil pressure is lost and the action<br>
of the spring is not sufficient to maintain the piston in the correct position.<br>
The no-return device generally consists of a rack or toothed portion integral<br>
with the piston or in any case with the mobile member, which is engaged by a<br>
spring-biased toothed or ratchet locking pad.<br>
Tensioners that can be fitted from the outside in the engine block or<br>
head, without any need to open the engine are called "cartridge" tensioners.<br>
EP-A-00830616.9, not yet published, describes a cartridge tensioner in which<br>
the rack portion is formed on the piston skirt. The ratchet pad is received in<br>
an opening in the cylinder skirt, with the possibility of axial sliding, and<br>
biased against the piston by a circular elastic band. For storage and shipping,<br><br>
before installation the piston is retained in a retracted position, in<br>
which only a small portion thereof extends from the cylinder, by engagement<br>
of a snap ring or circlip with an inside annular recess of the cylinder and an<br>
outside annular recess of the piston. To install the tensioner, it is necessary<br>
first to apply a force to the piston head which retracts it inside the cylinder for<br>
a length sufficient to move the retaining snap ring into a second, wider<br>
internal annular recess of the cylinder, so that the ring releases the piston.<br>
Although the solution provided in the aforementioned application is<br>
satisfactory for many applications, it nevertheless is not suitable in those<br>
situations where it is not possible or easy to apply the retraction force to the<br>
piston head.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,700,215 discloses a hydraulic tensioner having a<br>
cylinder and a solid piston or plunger movable inside the cylinder, in which a<br>
stopper screw for the piston is rotatably received in a through aperture of the<br>
cylinder wall and an internally threaded recess is formed on the inner end<br>
face of the piston. The screw, when engaged in the recess of the piston,<br>
retains the piston in a retracted condition, as can be required, for example, for<br>
maintenance purposes. This patent does not solve the problem concerning<br>
hollow piston or cartridge tensioners.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cartridge tensioner for drive transmission belts and chains comprises<br>
a cylinder with a cylinder bore, a piston slidably received in the cylinder bore<br>
and provided with a piston bore, a vent device housed in the piston bore and<br>
comprising an end part and a stem integral with each other, a pressure spring<br>
acting between a shoulder of the cylinder and the vent device, and a retaining<br>
device, accessible from the outside of the cylinder. When the retaining<br><br>
device is in a position engaged with the stem of the vent device, it<br>
retains the vent device, and prevents the action of the spring on the piston.<br>
When the retaining device is in a position of disengagement from the stem of<br>
the vent device, it allows the spring to bias the device against the piston and<br>
to act consequently on the piston. In a preferred embodiment, the end part is<br>
disc-shaped or convex.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention shows a cartridge tensioner with a retaining<br>
device, which can be applied in those situations where it is not possible or<br>
easy to apply an initial retracting force to the piston head.<br>
The tensioner of the present invention includes a cylinder, a retaining<br>
valve for the hydraulic fluid in the cylinder, a hollow piston movable inside<br>
the cylinder and having a piston bore, a vent device inside the piston bore, a<br>
pressure spring between the cylinder and the vent device, and a retaining<br>
device, preferably a stopper or retaining screw, rotatably received in the<br>
cylinder and in screwing engagement with a stem part of the vent device. The<br>
retaining screw is preferably disposed coaxially to the cylinder and is<br>
accessible from the opposite end thereof to that from which the piston<br>
protrudes.<br>
When the retaining screw is screwed completely into the stem, the disc<br>
is retained in a retracted position in which the spring cannot act on the piston.<br>
When the screw is disengaged from the stem, the spring biases the disc<br>
against the piston head, and thus acts on the piston, and the device operates in<br>
the traditional manner. The tensioner is preferably of the type comprising a<br>
longitudinal toothed portion of the piston and a ratchet retaining element or<br>
pad spring biased in engagement with the toothed portion or rack of the<br>
piston.<br>
The retaining device of the invention acts only on the spring, leaving<br>
the piston exposed to other forces. However, friction between the piston rack<br>
and the ratchet pad, if provided, when the spring action is eliminated, is<br>
generally sufficient to retain the piston. If necessary, moreover, an<br><br>
engagement or interference between the piston bore and the vent<br>
device can be foreseen, to retain the piston.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 1, a chain (1) is shown therein, which is wound<br>
on a driving sprocket (2) and a driven sprocket (3). The taut side (the lower<br>
one in the figure) is guided by a guide (4). A tensioner shoe (5) acts on the<br>
slack side (the upper one in the figure). The shoe (5) is mounted to oscillate<br>
around a pivot (6) and is biased against the chain by tensioning device (10).<br>
Referring also to Figs. 2 through 4, the tensioner (10) of the present<br>
invention comprises a cylinder (12), a piston (14), a vent device (16), a spring<br>
(18) and a retaining device (20). The cylinder (12) includes a cylinder skirt<br>
(21), a cylinder head (22), and a cylinder bore (23). An outer thread (24) on<br>
the skirt screws the cartridge tensioner into position in the engine block. The<br>
skirt is interrupted by a through aperture (25) which receives a toothed or<br>
ratchet pad (26), preferably of the type described in application EP-A-<br>
0083066.9, biased elastically toward the axis of the cylinder by an elastic<br>
band (27).<br>
The cylinder head (22) has a passage (28) coaxial with the bore (23)<br>
and in communication therewith, open toward the outside. Two housings (29)<br>
and (30) disposed with their axis (b) transversal to the axis (a) of the cylinder<br>
bore (23) receive a check valve (32) and a spiral pin (34), respectively. The<br>
valve (32) is preferably of a known type and therefore will not be described<br>
in detail. The pin (34), also of a known type, has a thin spiral groove (35) on<br>
a cylindrical surface thereof and is used to allow the passage of air during<br>
start-up of the device. The pin (34) also allows a controlled loss of oil, to<br>
define the dynamic elast-dampening characteristics of the tensioner.<br><br>
The piston (14) is hollow, has a piston bottom (36) with a<br>
central through hole (37) in a known manner, and a piston skirt (38) which<br>
defines a piston bore (40) on the inside. The piston skirt has a rack toothing<br>
(42) which cooperates with the toothing of the ratchet pad (26) in a known<br>
manner, to allow an extension movement of the piston from the cylinder bore<br>
(23) and to prevent a return movement of the piston inside the cylinder bore.<br>
The piston bore houses the vent device (16), which includes a end part<br>
(44) that controls passage of air, and a stem (46), integral therewith. The end<br>
part (44) is preferably disc- shaped or convex (for example hemispherical).<br>
The stem of the device has, at the opposite end to the disc, a threaded axial<br>
hole, or recess (47).<br>
The pressure spring (18) extends between a face of the vent device (44)<br>
and a bottom wall (13) of the cylinder bore (23).<br>
The retaining device or screw (20) comprises a head (48) and an<br>
integral threaded stem (49). The head (48) is received in the passage (28) so<br>
as to be able to rotate therein around the axis (a). The head (48) has a neck<br>
(48') that defines a seat for an O-ring type liquid seal ring (50). A snap ring<br>
(54) is received in a circumferential groove of the screw device (20) to retain<br>
the screw axially in one direction against a shoulder of the cylinder head. In<br>
the opposite direction, the screw is retained because the check valve (32) and<br>
the threaded pin (34) protrude inside the passage (28) for such a distance as<br>
not to allow the passage of a flared screw body portion, and because the<br>
screw head abuts against the cylinder head.<br>
Operation of the tensioner is now described. The tensioner (10) is<br>
shown in a rest or installation condition in Fig. 2. The threaded stem (49) of<br><br>
the screw (20) is screwed into the stem (46), so that the vent member<br>
or device (16) is maintained in a constrained retracted position in which it<br>
keeps the spring (18) compressed. The piston (14) is subject during handling<br>
and installation operations only to the action of its own weight. The elastic<br>
band (27) is calibrated so that the friction between the piston teeth (42) and<br>
the teeth of the pad (26) can withstand the action. If required, it is possible to<br>
combine this action with that of a friction assembling ("driving") of the piston<br>
(14) and the disc (44).<br>
By unscrewing the screw (20), which can be done easily by<br>
maneuvering a screwdriver from the end of the cylinder illustrated on the left<br>
in the figures, the stem member (16) is released from the screw device (20).<br>
This condition is shown in Fig. 3. The action of the spring (18) then brings<br>
the disc (44) against the bottom (36) of the piston and thereafter the action of<br>
the spring is applied to the piston. Consequently, the piston, overcoming the<br>
friction, tends to extend out of the cylinder and apply a bias to the tensioning<br>
shoe (not shown). The piston is shown in the condition of maximum<br>
extension from the cylinder in Fig. 4.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the elements<br>
corresponding to those of the preceding figures are denoted by the same<br>
reference numerals, and will not be further described in detail. The tensioner<br>
(10a) of Fig. 5 differs from the tensioner (10) of the preceding figures<br>
essentially in that the screw device (20a) is retained axially, not by<br>
engagement of the snap ring (54) against a shoulder of the cylinder head<br>
passage, but by ridges (56) of the screw shank, and by a widened portion (55)<br>
thereof, which engage with inward protruding end parts of check valve (32)<br><br>
and of spiral pin (34). Operation of the device (10a) is similar that of<br>
the device (10) and will not be further described.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an alternative embodiment (10b) of the tensioner in which<br>
a retaining screw device (20a) similar to that of Fig. 5 (but it could also be the<br>
device (20) of Figs. 2-4) is applied to the stem of a vent device (16b) that<br>
cooperates with a piston (14b) without side toothing. The members of the<br>
tensioner (10b) identical to those of the tensioners of the preceding figures<br>
are denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described in<br>
detail. The disk (16b) preferably interferes with a portion of the inner surface<br>
of the skirt of piston (14b) so as to be able during handling and assembly<br>
operations to retain the piston when only the action of its own weight and not<br>
that of the spring (18) is applied thereto, that is in the rest condition<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6.<br>
Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the<br>
invention herein described are merely illustrative of the application of the<br>
principles of the invention. Reference herein to details of the illustrated<br>
embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, which<br>
themselves recite those features regarded as essential to the invention.<br><br>
