				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention in general relates to the field of MFP. Particularly, the present invention relates to the field of paper trays and count of papers used in printers/MFP. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for dynamic paper counting in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A U S Patent no. 4,535,463, titled "Apparatus for detecting number of remaining sheets" describes an improved paper feeding device, for example, a copying machine is capable of warning a user about the status of available paper sheets. A movable support tray can be monitored to provide a measurement of the total initial height of the paper stack and subsequent movements of this paper stack to introduce individual copy paper sheets into a paper transport system can be correlated with the actual number of sheets that are transported. From these monitored values, it is possible to calculate the number of sheets remaining on the stack and to provide an audible, vocal or visual display of the actual number or relative condition to warn a user.<br>
Another U S Patent no. 4,227,071 titled "Electronic currency counter" describes an electronic currency counter, counts a stack of paper currency via a light beam and a plurality of photo responsive cells. A counter in a housing is electrically connected to the cells for counting the electrical signals produced thereby and an indicator electrically connected to the counter in the housing visually indicates the count of the counter.<br>
It has been customary to estimate a remaining amount of papers based on a level, or height, of the tray. Specifically, when the tray has been raised beyond a certain reference level, it is determined that a paper-end or a near-paper-end condition is<br><br>
reached in order to avoid an occurrence that papers are used up during the course of copying cycles. Usually, a level of the tray is determined by counting up pulses which an encoder mounted in the paper feeding device generates during upward and downward movements of the tray. Meanwhile, various kinds of papers are used with a copier and they differ in thickness, for example. It follows that for the same number encoder output pulses a comparatively large number of papers may have been left if the paper thickness is small and a comparatively small number of papers if otherwise. In this manner, the prior art system for sensing a remaining amount of papers lacks in reliability.<br>
Limitation in the previous art is that a single row of photo responsive cells is dimensioned to correspond to the thickness of single piece of paper. Printer or MFP has multiple paper trays. Each paper tray can have any one of the specified paper type (thick / thin or transparent or etc) and can be changed or customized. Each paper thickness varies and there are various thicknesses of paper being used. In such cases the precise paper count can't be attained.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to invent a method for dynamic paper counting in MFP wherein the Paper count changes when paper is added or removed from paper tray.<br>
Printer or MFP has multiple paper trays. Each paper tray can have any one of the specified paper type (thick / thin, transparent etc.) and can be changed or customized. Each paper thickness varies and there is various size of paper being used. So a generic paper counter should be hosted to count the number of paper. Also a normal way of counting papers will need manual parsing of papers through the roller which will disturb the original arrangement of papers.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for dynamic paper counting in MFP comprising the steps of:<br><br>
(a)	mounting a light source on one side of the wall of the paper tray where the light falls directly on the opposite side of the wall of the paper tray;<br>
(b)	mounting photo responsive cells on the said opposite side wall of the tray where the light falling on the wall is detected by the photo responsive cells that are present;<br>
(c)	selecting a paper type and the mapping tray in the MFP and keeping one paper and closing the said tray;<br>
(d)	capturing the count of paper and the count of photo responsive cells blocked by the said one paper of the specified paper type;<br>
(e)	storing the captured counts in the memory of the MFP; and<br>
(f)	obtaining the paper count when all the papers are loaded and tray is closed by the factor of total number of blocked photo responsive cells divided by number of photo responsive cells blocked by one paper of specified paper type.<br>
The photo responsive cells are minutely dimensioned. The paper is placed in between the light source and photo responsive cells. When paper is placed in the tray, the said paper blocks the light from other side of the TRAY which was suppose to fall on the PHOTORESPONSIVE cells. A single paper count is measured in multiples of rows of photo responsive cells blocked. When a tray is opened and closed the paper count is recalculated and stored in memory. The paper count is decremented when paper is taken for printing from the particular tray. A memory region is allocated to store the number of blocked photo responsive cells for one paper of the specified paper type and also for all the supported paper types. A paper counter is initiated after the tray close is detected via hardware interrupt. A paper counter is initiated after paper type of the specified tray is changed. For indicating the initializing routine the paper type is mentioned for the specified tray along with paper count initialization bit value.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows photo responsive cells which are minutely dimensioned so that a single paper count is measured in multiples of rows of photo responsive cells.<br>
Figure 2 shows an ariel view of arrangement of paper tray with one side of the walls having light source and opposite side has photo responsive cells, with space in-between where paper will be placed<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention is an enhanced method which is capable of accurately sensing the remaining amount of papers before the copying operation with no regard to the kind of papers used.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, it shows photo responsive cells which are minutely dimensioned so that a single paper count is measured in multiples of rows of photo responsive cells. The Figure explains the below components:<br>
a) Height of Single Paper (of sample type):<br><br>
When this paper is placed it blocks the light from other side of the TRAY which was suppose to fall on the PHOTORESPONSIVE cells.<br>
b) Number of Blocked Photo Responsive Cells for a single paper:<br>
In the figure the height of a single paper is found out by the equivalent number of<br>
blocked cells.<br>
Further referring to figure 2, it shows an Ariel view of arrangement of paper tray with one side of the walls having light source and opposite side has photo responsive cells, with space in-between where paper will be placed. It further describes:<br>
a)	Light Source: It is mounted on one side of the wall of the paper tray. The light will fall directly on the other side of the wall of the Paper tray.<br>
b)	Photo Responsive Cells: It is mounted on the wall of the tray where the Light Source will fall. The light Falling is detected by the photo responsive cells that are present.<br>
Arrangement:<br>
The photo responsive cells of any suitable type are minutely dimensioned and are mounted on the other side of the wall of the paper tray for receiving the beam of light.<br>
The paper type is selected and the mapping tray is selected in an MFP. Only one paper is kept and the tray is closed. The count of paper is shown and also the count of photo responsive cells blocked by one paper of the specified paper type is captured and stored in the memory of the MFP.<br>
Then all the papers are loaded and tray is closed. Now the paper count (PC) is obtained by the factor of total number of blocked photo responsive cells divided by number of photo responsive cells blocked by one paper of specified paper type (value stored in memory of MFP).<br><br>
Thus when the tray opened and closed is sensed the paper count is recalculated and stored in memory and after that the paper count is decremented when paper is taken for printing from that particular tray.<br>
Thus by the arrangement shown in Figure 2 wherein a paper tray used by MFP which can have different types of paper and has an generic counting mechanism which can count the number of papers of the type of paper being used. This arrangement also doesn't need to disturb the arrangement of papers which in case of normal paper counters.<br>
The invention thus combines various steps:<br>
a)	Forming an arrangement as said in paper tray used by MFP.<br>
b)	Allocating a memory region to store the number of blocked photo responsive cells for one paper of the specified paper type, for all the supported paper types.<br>
c)	Initiating the paper counter after the TRAY close is detected via hardware interrupt. This is done because paper tray is opened generally to load or remove or change paper types.<br>
d)	Initiating the paper count after paper type of the specified TRAY is changed.<br>
Initializing routine which will calculate the number of blocked photo responsive cells for one paper of the specified paper type. For this the paper type is mentioned for the specified tray and also paper count initialization bit value in order to indicate the initializing routine. Then only one paper loaded in the specified paper tray and tray is closed. Now as per (C) Paper counter will be initiated and the count of number of blocked photo responsive cells for one paper will be stored in the said memory in (b).<br>
Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the<br><br>
invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other changes and modifications may be affected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
