				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention is in the field of nanoparticle drug delivery system<br>
and more particularly the invention discloses a nanoparticulate coenzyme Q10 (CoQIO) composition and preparation thereof.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
CoQIO is naturally occurring compound that plays a key role in energy metabolism as an integral part of electron transport system. Several studies have provided the evidence of the potentials of CoQIO in prophylaxis and therapy of various disorder related oxidative stress. CoQIO deficiency has been confirmed in patient with cardiovascular disorders like congestive heart failure coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, cardiomyopathy and hypertension. CoQIO deficiency also reported in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. CoQIO functions as antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and inhibiting free radicals. Despite of its potential pharmacological activity I many diseases, not much progress has been made in terms of formulation aspect owing to its poor aqueous and heigh molecular weight, leaving behind this molecule in the class of difficult to deliver molecules (class IV of Biopharmaceutical Classification System). The efficiency of CoQIO absorption and its bioavailability when given by oral route is very low from the current marketed products.<br>
Recently nanoparticles made of degradable and non-degradable materials have been actively explored as delivery system for both small and large drug molecules. Poorly water soluble and high molecular weight molecules are often difficult to process into dosage form that afford adequate oral bioavailability for clinical studies and commercialization of CoQIO is no exception with poor aqueous solubility and a high molecular weight of 863.<br>
Hence, there is a need for CoQIO formulation which has got higher bioavailability and the present invention has made an effort to provide<br>
alternative formulation which obviates the existing problem of using CoQIO.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to develop a nanoparticle based drug delivery system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to formulate nanoparticulate composition of CoQIO to increase its oral bioavailability.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention deals with designing of nanoparticles that can effectively deliver the CoQIO orally, and more particularly relates to dose reduction, improved bioavailability and efficacy.<br>
The main embodiment of the invention is Polymeric biodegradable CoQIO loaded nanoparticles for oral delivery was prepared by the emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method which consists of following steps:<br>
a)	dissolving of CoQIO and polymer in organic phase<br>
b)	addition of the organic phase of step  (a)  to aqueous system containing<br>
stabilizer /surfactant resulting into emulsion<br>
c)	stirring the emulsion followed by homogenization of emulsion,<br>
d)	addition of water to homogenized emulsion at constant stirring, and<br>
e) removal of organic solvent at controlled conditions thereby transforming the emulsion into a liquid-solid suspension, whereby the solid comprises of polymeric nanoparticles of PLGA loaded with CoQW for oral administration.<br>
The nanoparticles were optimized for drug loading. The effect of initial drug loading on particle size, particle size distribution, PDI, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency was investigated. It was observed that there was no significant change in particle size with increasing CoQIO loading from 5 to 30 %w/w of polymer; however a slight increase in the particle size along with PDI was observed for 50% and 75% initial drug loading.<br>
Increase in encapsulation efficiency was found with increase in initial drug loading from 5 to 20% w/w of polymer (from 61.7Â±3.9 for 5% to 82.0Â±3.3 for 20%) and beyond 20% the entrapment efficiency was around 80%. There was no change in zeta potential for any of the different drug loading batches (table 2). All the initial drug loading batches showed good reproducibility as observed from low standard deviation values. The nanoparticulate system was capable of entrapping small as well as large amount of drug without dramatic change in particle size and PDI. Such large range of initial drug loading provides us an option to produce different dose formulations without any change in the process. The high drug loading capacity along with high entrapment efficiency makes it a commercially feasible process. The prepared nanoparticles were evaluated for absorption characteristics by in situ studies and for its efficacy in hypertensive and breast cancer animal models (table 2).<br>

The invention is illustrated by the following examples which are only meant to illustrate the invention and not act as limitations. All the embodiments apparent to a process their in the art are deemed to fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Process for the preparation of CoQIO loaded polymeric nanoparticles<br>
Nanoparticles were prepared by adopting an emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique, which was further optimized for drug loading. The increase in initial drug loading from 5 to 20% w/w of polymer led to increase in encapsulation efficiency and beyond 20% initial loading, the entrapment efficiency reached a plateau of 80%. There was no significant change in particle size and distribution with increasing drug loading from 5 to 30 %w/w of polymer; however a slight increase in the particle size and distribution was observed for 50% and 75% initial drug loading. The nanoparticles when evaluated for in situ uptake studies in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, showed better uptake in comparison to suspension form. The values of uptake were 45% for CoQIO suspension and 79% for CoQIO loaded nanoparticles. The nanoparticulate formulation was evaluated in hypertensive rats. The nanoparticles were compared with suspension form and<br>
. the commercial formulation. The ability of 3 doses of CoQIO (100 mg/kg) to treat hypertension was far more superior to 7 doses of CoQIO in suspension form and 3 doses of commercial formulation. CoQIO at 60% lower dose in nanoparticulate form was able to bring blood pressure to normal range on 12th day in comparison to the suspension form. The CoQIO nanoparticles were further investigated in breast cancer model and compared with the suspension form. The CoQIO nanoparticles showed better efficacy than the suspension form in reducing the tumor size. The in situ uptake studies along with evaluation in hypertension and cancer animal models clearly indicate the efficacy of CoQIO in the form of nanoparticles to that of suspension form and currently available commercial formulation.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of CoQIO loaded nanoparticles: 50 mg of polymer (of polyester family: Polycaprolactone (PCL), Poly Lactide (PLA), Poly Glycolide (PGA) and copolymers of these like Poly Lactide-co-Glycolide (PLGA), PLA-PCL etc) was dissolved in 2 ml organic phase (ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, acetone and co-solvent systems of different organic solvent) at room temperature for 2 hours. CoQIO was dissolved in 0.5ml of organic phase and added to the polymeric solution and stirred for 1 hour. The organic phase was then emulsified with 5 ml of an aqueous phase containing stabilizer/surfactant (PVA, DMAB or Vitamin ETPGS). The resulting o/w emulsion was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour before homogenizing at 15000 rpm for 5 min using a high-speed homogenizer (Polytron PT4000; Polytron Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). To this emulsion, water was added with constant stirring which resulted into nanoprecipitation. The prepared nanoparticles have been optimized for drug loading.<br>
Example 3<br>
Evaluation of CoQIO nanoparticles for its intestinal absorption and efficacy in<br>
animal models.<br>
Evaluation for intestinal absorption by in situ up takes study: Closed loop method was used to assess the uptake of CoQIO in suspension form and CoQIO loaded PLGA nanoparticles prepared using DMAB as stabilizer with 20 and 50% w/w of polymer as initial drug loading. Overnight fasted male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of thiopentone (50 mg/kg). The intestine was exposed through a midline incision and a closed loop of 10 cm length was prepared on the upper jejunum by ligation at both the ends. 1 ml of aqueous drug suspension or drug loaded nanoparticles containing 20 mg of CoQIO was injected into the loop with a syringe. Then entire intestine was restored to the abdominal cavity and body temperature was maintained during anesthesia. After 2 hours of drug administrationy the loops were rapidly isolated from the body. Contents of the loop were emptied into a container. The lumen of the intestine was rinsed with 10 ml water followed by 10 ml of methanol. The water and methanol solutions were collected and processed accordingly and diluted appropriately and the unabsorbed drug remaining in the solution was analyzed by HPLC. The uptake of CoQIO in the form of suspension was found to be 45%. It has been reported that around 60% of the CoQIO is excreted in feces in unchanged form and our uptake results closely match the reported values. The uptake of CoQIO nanoparticles was found to be 79% significantly greater than the suspension form clearly demonstrating the superiority of the nanoparticulate system for its absorption characteristics.<br>
Evaluation of efficacy of nanoparticulate system in breast cancer model:<br>
The prepared CoQIO nanoparticles were evaluated in breast cancer model. Female SD rats were administered DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene). Twenty two weeks after administration of DMBA the animals developed tumors. The animals were divided into 3 groups.<br>
One group received no treatment (untreated group); second group received 25 mg of CoQIO in suspension form and the last group was administered nanoparticles containing 25 mg of CoQIO.<br>
Frequency of administration was once a week for both the groups for 8 weeks. After administration of 8th dose (30th week from administration of DMBA) the animals were sacrificed and the tumors were removed and their volume measured. The nanoparticulate formulation was able to reduce the tumor burden by about 68% to that of untreated groups, whereas in the CoQIO suspension group the reduction was about 61 %. It was quite interesting to note the fact that in CoQIO suspension group there was a huge variability between the animals which is in agreement to the reported literature about variable bioavailability of CoQIO. The study demonstrated the efficacy of CoQIO in cancer treatment and incorporation of CoQIO into nanoparticles leads to further increase in efficacy, minimizing the variable bioavailability hence demonstrating the potential role of nanoparticulate system for cancer therapy.<br>
Example 4<br>
Evaluation of CoQIO nanoparticles in hypertensive rats:<br>
Goldblatt method (2K1C) was used for induction of hypertension. The animals were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 was sham operated group; Group 2 was vehicle treated group. After surgery, Group 3 received 7 doses of CoQIO in suspension form (100 mg/Kg) while Group 4 and Group 5 received 3 doses of CoQIO (lOOmg/kg), as commercial formulation and prepared polymeric nanoparticles respectively. Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was recorded on 12th and 15th day after surgery using tail cuff blood pressure recorder (IITC INC., Life Science Instruments, Model No. 29,229; California, USA). Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an index of lipid peroxidation, were measured. MDA reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) as a thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) to produce a red complex that has a peak absorbance at 532 nm. On the 15th day after surgery, blood was collected from tail vein of rat under mild ether anesthesia into centrifuge tubes containing heparin and was used for estimation of MDA levels. On the 12th day after surgery, it was observed that renal clipping was able to induce hypertension in animals. The vehicle treated group had a higher average blood pressure (systolic 163.86Â±2.8 and diastolic<br>
100.62Â±1.3 nun Hg) as compared to sham operated group (systolic 125.22Â±2.6 and diastolic 82.56Â±0.06 mm Hg). Administration of CoQIO was able to partially prevent the hypertension. The efficacy of 3 doses of nanoparticles in preventing hypertension (systolic 125.93Â±5.27and diastolic 83.36Â±2.39) was far more superior to 7 doses of CoQIO in suspension form (systolic 140.17Â±3.67 and diastolic 89.67Â±1.85). 3 doses of nanoparticles were able to reduce the blood pressure by 38 and 17 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic respectively in comparison to vehicle treated group while 7 doses were able to reduce it by 23 and 11 mm Hg (diastolic and systolic respectively). When the prepared nanoparticles were compared to commercial formulation, the nanoparticles were found to be more efficacious. The commercial formulation was able to reduce hypertension by 13 and 7 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) respectively. The BP of nanoparticulate treated group was close to that of sham operated groups clearly demonstrating the efficacy of nanoparticulate systems. Similar results were obtained on 15th day after surgery. A marked difference in BP between vehicle treated group (systolic 164.53Â±1.50 and diastolic 100.31Â±0.99 mm Hg) was observed when compared to sham operated (systolic 119.50Â±2.18 and diastolic 78+1.92). The efficacy of 3 doses of nanoparticles in preventing hypertension (systolic 134.28Â±4.10 and diastolic 85.06Â±1.44) was again superior to 7 doses of CoQIO in suspension form (systolic 141.22Â±1.57 and diastolic 90.78Â±0.68) and 3 doses of commercial formulation. Three doses of nanoparticles were able to reduce the blood pressure by 30 and 17 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic in comparison to vehicle treated group while 7 doses were able to reduce 23 and 10 mmHg for diastolic and systolic BP and commercial formulation showed reduction by 15 and 8 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic respectively when compared to vehicle treated group. The efficacy of nanoparticulate system to reduce the MDA (malondialdehyde) levels by scavenging free radicals was also higher than compared to other formulations. From the results it was clear that incorporation of CoQIO into nanoparticles leads to an increase in efficacy of the drug for treatment of hypertension which may be due to increased bioavailability and sustained release from the nanoparticulate formulations. The nanoparticulate<br>
systems were able to reduce the dose by approximately 60%. So the nanoparticulate system is promising for therapeutic applications of CoQIO in hypertension. These nanoparticles formulations can also be used for various other therapeutic applications of CoQIO like in neurodegenerative disorders and other cardiovascular disorders.<br>
