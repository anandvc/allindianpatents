We claim:<br>
1.	A method of preparing a binder composition for treating particulate material such<br>
as herein described to form a solid aggregate matrix including the steps of:<br>
-mixing a urea formaldehyde precondensate; a polar solvent such as herein described; additional urea; fulvic acid or salt thereof; to form a binder composition;<br>
-mixing the binder composition with soil;<br>
-allowing the binder composition to set over a period of at least 30 minutes from being mixed with the said particulate material, the fulvic acid or salt thereof being selected such as to render the pH of the binder composition to a value from 2.0 to 5.3.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the polar solvent is selected from the group<br>
consisting of water, alcohol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claims 1 or claim 2 which includes the further step of<br>
adding a sugar prior to the step of setting.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the sugar is selected from the group<br>
consisting of sucrose, glucose and fructose and mixtures thereof.<br>
5.	A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 which includes the further step of<br>
adding a binding promoter for enhancing the binding between the binder composition and the particulate material.<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the binding promoter is a complex fatty<br>
acid derived from the complete oxidation of vegetable sugars.<br>
7.	A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the binding promoter is bitumen.<br>
8.	A method as claimed in claim 7 wherein the bitumen is in the form of an anionic<br>
bitumen emulsion.<br>
9.	A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the binding promoter is in the form of a<br>
surfactant.<br>
10.	A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein the surfactant is in the form of sodium dodecyl bensene.<br>
11.	A method as claimed in any one of preceding claims which includes the further step of adding any one or more agents selected from the group consisting of silicones, silanes, silanoles, oils, anti-corrosion agents, ultra violet light blocking agents, biocides, pH buffers, cement, ammonia, ammonium salts, plasticisers, ligna sulphinates and oxides thereof, phenols and mixtures thereof.<br>
12.	A method as claimed in claim 11 wherein the plasticisers are selected from the group consisting of phthalates, hydrocarbons, acetates, latex and glycols.<br><br>
13.	A method as claimed in claim 11 or 12 wherein the ultra violet light blocking agents are selected from the group consisting of organic phenols, phosphates and inorganic oxides.<br>
14.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the particulate material is selected from the group consisting of sand, soil, gravel, natural or synthetic fibres including glass-, steel-, carbon-and polymeric fibres, clay, silicas, particulate ore, rubber, stones, pebbles, partly bound cementitious masses, grass, slag, waste dump material, coal particles, ash, and mixtures thereof.<br>
15.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the<br>
formaldehyde: urea ratio in the binder composition is between 1.5 and 2.5 :1.<br>
16.	A method as claimed in claim 15 wherein the formaldehyde: urea ratio in the binder composition is 1.83 :1.<br>
17.	A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the acid is a weak organic acid.<br>
18.	A method as claimed in claim 17 wherein the weak organic acid is selected from the group consisting of citric acid and acetic acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
19.	A settable binder composition for mixing with a particulate material and setting to form a solid aggregate matrix, the binder composition comprising a mixture of a urea formaldehyde precondensate; a polar solvent; additional urea; and fulvic acid or salt thereof selected such as to render the pH of the binder composition to a<br>
