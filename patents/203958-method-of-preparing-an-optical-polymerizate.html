METHOD OF PREPARING AN OPTICAL POLYMERIZATE<br>
PPG INDUSTRIES OHIO, INC. of 3800 WEST 143RD STREET, CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A. AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
METHOD OF PREPARING AN OPTICAL POLYMERIZATE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional       Patent Application Ser. No. 60/166,184 filed November 18, 1999 and entitled "Method of Preparing an Optical Polymer".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a polymerizate from a two-component organic composition, the polymerizate having a refractive index of at least 1.6, an Abbe number of at least 33 and an initial Barcol hardness of at least 1.  More particularly, the present invention relates to polymerizing certain two-component organic compositions comprising at least one polycyanate reactant having at least two isocyanate and/or isothiocyanate groups, and a polyamine having at least two primary and/or secondary amine groups. The present invention also relates to polymerizates and photochromic articles.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
A number of organic polymeric materials, e.g., plastics, have been developed as alternatives and replacements for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies.  As used herein, the term "glass" is meant to refer to silica-based inorganic glass.  These polymeric materials can provide advantages relative to glass, including, shatter resistance, lighter weight for a given application, ease of molding and       ease  of dying.  Representative examples of such polymeric materials include, poly(methyl methacrylate), thermoplastic polycarbonate and poly[diethylene glycol bis(allylcarbonate)].<br>
The refractive indices of many polymeric materials are generally lower than that of glass.  For example, the refractive index of poly[diethylene glycol<br>
bis(allylcarbonate)] is about 1.50, compared to that of high index glass, which can range, for example, from 1.60 to 1.80.<br><br>
-2-<br>
When fabricating lenses to correct a given degree of visual defect, e.g., a correction for myopia, the use of a polymeric material having a lower refractive index will require a thicker, lens relative to a material having a higher refractive index, e.g., high index glass.  When the degree of correction required is substantial, as in the case of severe myopia, a lens fabricated from a low index polymeric material can be required to be very thick. A very thick lens may negate any benefit resulting from the use of lower density lens materials relative to an equivalent degree of correction obtained from a higher refractive index glass lens.  In addition, thicker optical lenses are not aesthetically desirable.<br>
It is known that polymeric materials having refractive indices greater than 1.50 can be prepared from aromatic monomers and monomers containing halogens and/or sulfur atoms. The materials from which lenses, and in particular optical lenses, are fabricated can be categorized by their refractive indices.  As those skilled in the art can appreciate, low indices typically include indices of refraction of from less than 1.50 through 1.53; middle indices comprise indices of refraction of from 1.54 through 1.57; and high indices commonly include indices of refraction of 1.58 and greater. Lenses prepared from polymeric materials having high refractive indices typically also have lower Abbe (also known as nu-values) .  Lower Abbe numbers are indication of an increasing level of chromatic dispersion, which is typically manifested as an optical distortion at or rim of the lens.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,961,889 to Jiang et al. disclose polymers, for use in lenses, prepared from a polymers containing component, a polyisocyanate group- component and/or a polyfunctional vinyl group-component. The polymers disclosed typically had refractive indices less than 1.69 and Abbe number less than 35.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,932,681 to Herold et al. discloses an optical polymer, for use as a lens material, prepared from, an isocyanate or isothiocyanate and a polythiol. The polymers<br><br>
-3-                          disclosed have a refractive index of at least 1.57 and an Abbe number of at least 33.<br>
U.S. Patent  No. 5,679,756 to Zhu et al.   discloses an optical polymer described as a thermoplastic thiourethane-urethane copolymer prepared by reacting an aliphatic diisocyanate with a dithiol to form a thiourethane prepolymer, which is then reacted with a diisocyanate and a polyol. The polymers disclosed typically had a refractive index between 1.57 and 1.60 and Abbe number between 35 and 38.<br>
While the optical polymers discussed above have adequate refractive indices and chromatic dispersion, they do not necessarily have the degree of impact resistance required to be suitable for use as daily wear lenses for eyeglasses.<br>
It is accordingly desirable then to identify new polymeric materials, for example polymerizates, which can be used to prepare transparent polymerizates, particularly optical lenses that possess a combination of high refractive index and adequately high Abbe number as well as possessing the physical properties, in particular impact resistance, that are at least equivalent to and preferably better than those of lower index polymeric materials.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, etc. used herein are to be understood as modified in all    instances by the term "about."<br>
The present invention provides a method of preparing a polymerizate, which includes the step of polymerizing a two-component composition comprising:<br>
(a)	a first component containing at least one<br>
polycyanate reactant having at least two functional groups<br>
selected from isocyanate, isothiocyanate and combinations<br>
thereof, the polycyanate reactant being the reaction product<br>
of,<br>
(i) a polythiol monomer having at least two thiol groups;<br>
(ii) a polycyanate monomer having at least two functional groups selected from isocyanate, isothiocyanate and combinations thereof; and<br>
(iii) optionally a reactive hydrogen material having at least two reactive hydrogen groups, the reactive hydrogen material being selected from polyols, materials having both hydroxyl and thiol groups, and mixtures thereof, the relative amounts of (i), (ii) and (iii) being selected such that the molar equivalents ratio of (NCO + NCS)/{SH + OH) is greater than 1.0; and<br>
(b)	a second component containing at least one<br>
polyamine reactant having at least two functional groups<br>
selected from primary amine, secondary amine and combinations<br>
thereof.  The first and second components are selected such<br>
that when they are polymerized, they provide a polymerizate<br>
having a refractive index of at least 1.6 (e.g., from 1.60 to<br>
1.74), an Abbe number of at least 33 and an initial Barcol<br><br>
 -5-<br>
. hardness of at least 1. The refractive index is determined in accordance with American Standard Test Method (ASTM) number D 542-95. The Abbe number or nu-value is determined using an appropriate instrument, for example a Bausch &amp; Lomb ABBE-3L Refractometer. The initial Barcdl hardness (also commonly referred to as a zero second Barcol hardness) is determined in accordance with ASTM No. D 2583-95.<br>
      The polycyanate reactant of the first component of the two-component composition has at least two functional groups selected from isocyanate (-NCO), isothiocyanate (-NCS) and combinations of isocyanate and isothiocyanate groups.  As used herein, the term "cyanate" refers to isocyanate and isothiocyanate groups that are unblocked (or uncapped), and that are capable of forming a covalent bond with a reactive hydrogen group, e.g., a thiol, hydroxyl or amine group.<br>
The polycyanate reactant is the reaction product of a polythiol monomer, a polycyanate monomer and optionally a reactive hydrogen material, such as a polyol or a material having both hydroxyl and thiol groups.  In preparing the polycyanate reactant, the relative amounts of polythiol monomer, polycyanate monomer and optional reactive hydrogen material are selected such that the molar equivalents ratio of (NCO + NCS)/(SH + OH) is greater than 1.0, e.g., from 1.2 : 1.0 to 4.0 : 1.0 or from 2.0 : 1.0 to 3.0 : 1.0.<br>
The polycyanate reactant of the first component of the two-component composition has backbone linkages selected from urethane linkages (-NH-C(0)-0-), thiourethane linkages (-NH-C(O)-S-), thiocarbamate linkages (-NH-C(S)-0-), dithiourethane linkages"(-NH-C(S)-S-) and combinations thereof.  The molecular weight of the polycyanate reactant can vary widely, for example, having a number average molecular (Mn) of from 500 to 15,000, or from 500 to 5000, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards.<br>
Polythiol monomers that are used to prepare the polycyanate reactant have at least two thiol groups and may be selected from aliphatic polythiols, cycloaliphatic polythiols, aromatic polythiols and mixtures thereof.  In addition, the<br><br>
-6-<br>
polythiol monomer may also contain linkages selected from ether linkages (-0-), sulfide linkages (-S-), polysulfide linkages (-SX-, wherein x is at least 2, e.g., from 2 to 4) and combinations of such linkages.  As used herein, by "thiol," "thiol group," "mercapto" or "mercapto group" is meant an -SH group which is capable of forming a thiourethane linkage, (i.e., -NH-C(O)-S-) with an isocyanate group or a dithioruethane linkage (i.e., -NH-C(S)-S-) with an isothiocyanate group.<br>
Examples of polythiol monomers that may be used to prepare the polycyanate reactant include, but are not limited to, 2,5-dimercaptomethyl-l,4-dithiane, 2,2"-thiodiethanethiol, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate), pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate), trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate), trimethylolpropane tris(2-mercaptoacetate), 4-mercaptomethyl-3,6-dithia-l,8-octanedithiol, 4-tert-butyl-l,2-benzenedithiol, 4,4"-thiodibenzenethiol, benzenedithiol, ethylene glycol di(2-mercaptoacetate), ethylene glycol di(3-mercaptopropionate), poly(ethylene glycol) di(2-mercaptoacetate) and poly(ethylene glycol) di(3-mercaptopropionate).  Mixtures of polythiol monomers may also be used to prepare the polycyanate reactant.<br>
The polythiol monomer may also be selected from polythiols represented by the following general formula I,<br><br>
wherein R1  and R2 are each independently selected from straight or branched chain alkylene, cyclic alkylene, phenylene and C1-C9 alkyl substituted phenylene.  Examples of straight or branched chain alkylene from which R1 and R2 may be selected include, but are not limited to, methylene, ethylene, 1,3-propylene, 1,2-propylene, 1,4-butylene, 1,2-butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, nonylene, decylene, undecylene, octadecylene and icosylene.  Examples of cyclic<br><br>
-7-                alkylenes from which R1 and R2 may each be selected include, but are not limited to, cyclopentylene, cyclohexylene, cycloheptylene, cyclooctylene, and alkyl substituted derivatives thereof.  The divalent linking groups R1 and R2 may also be selected from phenylene and alkyl substituted phenylene, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and nonyl substituted phenylene.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, R1 and R2 are each methylene or ethylene.<br>
The polythiol represented by general formula I may be prepared from an esterification or transesterification reaction between 3-mercapto-l,2-propanediol (Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry No. 96-27-5) and a thiol functional carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid ester in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, e.g., methane sulfonic acid, with the concurrent removal of water or alcohol from the reaction mixture.  More particularly, a preferred polythiol monomer, for which R1 and R2 are each methylene with reference to general formula I.<br>
As used herein, the polythiol monomer described and nanied with reference to general formula I, e.g., thiglycerol bis (2-mercaptoacetate) , is meant to include also any related co-product oligomeric species and polythiol monomer compositions containing residual starting materials.  For example, when washing the reaction mixture resulting from the esterification of 3-mercapto-l,2-propanediol and a thiol functional carboxylic acid, e.g., 2-mercaptoacetic acid, with excess base, e.g., aqueous ammonia, oxidative coupling of thiol groups may occur.  Such an oxidative coupling can result in the formation of oligomeric polythiol species having disulfide linkages, i.e., -S-S- linkages.<br>
The polythiol monomer used to prepare the polycyanate reactant may be a polythiol oligomer having disulfide linkages, which is prepared from the reaction of a polythiol monomer having at least two thiol groups and sulfur in the presence of a basic catalyst.  The molar equivalent ratio of polythiol monomer to sulfur is from m to (m-1) wherein m is an integer from 2 to 21.  The polythiol monomer may be selected .<br><br>
-8-<br>
from those examples as recited previously herein, e.g., 2,5-dimercaptomethyl-1,4-dithiane.  The sulfur used may be in the form of, for example, crystalline, colloidal, powder and sublimed sulfur, and having a purity of at least 98 percent and preferably at least 99 percent.<br>
Co-product oligomeric species can include oligomers of general formula I which can be described by general formula la:<br><br>
wherein R1  and R2 are as described above, n and m are independently an integer from 0 to 21 and n + m is at least 1. General formula Ia demonstrates that oligomerization can occur through disulfide bonds forming between any of the thiol groups in general structure 1.  Although all possibilities are not shown, general structure Ia is meant to represent all possible oligomers that can form from general structure I.<br>
The basic catalyst used to prepare the polythiol oligomer having disulfide linkages may be selected from ammonia, amine and mixtures thereof.  Examples of amines include, but are not limited to alkylamines, e.g., ethylamine and n-butylamine, dialkylamines, e.g., diethylamine, trialkylamines, e.g., triethylamine, morpholine, substituted morpholine, piperidine and substituted piperidine.  The basic catalyst is typically present in an amount of from 0.001 to 1.0 mole percent, e.g., from 0.01 to 0.1 mole percent, based on the moles of polythiol<br><br>
-9-                           monomer present at the beginning of the reaction.  The basic catalyst may be charged together to a reaction vessel along with the polythiol monomer and sulfur, or may be added to the reaction vessel after the addition of the polythiol monomer and sulfur.<br>
Synthesis of the polythiol oligomer having disulfide linkages may be conducted in the presence of a solvent, e.g., halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, and ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran.  The polythiol oligomer may be prepared at a temperature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent, e.g., from room temperature to 1200C.  The preparation of polythiol oligomers having disulfide linkages that are useful in the present invention is described in further detail in United States Patent No. 5,961,889, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the polythiol oligomer having disulfide linkages may be selected from those represented by the following general formula II,<br><br>
wherein n is an integer from 1 to 21.  The polythiol oligomer represented by general formula II may be prepared from the reaction of 2,5-dimeracaptomethyl-l,4-dithiane with sulfur in the presence of a basic catalyst, as described previously herein.<br>
The polycyanate monomer (a)(ii) used to prepare the polycyanate reactant of the first component (a) may be selected from polyisocyanates having at least two isocyanate groups, isothiocyanates having at least two isothiocyanate groups and polycyanates having both isocyanate and isothiocyanate groups.

When used to prepare photochromic articles, e.g., lenses, . the polymerizate should be transparent to that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which activates the photochromic substance(s) incorporated in the matrix, i.e., that wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the colored or open form of the photochromic substance and that portion of the visible spectrum that includes the absorption maximum wavelength of the photochromic substance in its UV activated form, i.e., the open form.  Photochromic substances that may be utilized with the polymerizates of the present invention are organic photochromic compounds or substances containing<br><br>
-24-                          same that may be incorporated, e.g., dissolved, dispersed or diffused into such polymerizates.<br>
A first group of organic photochromic substances contemplated for use to form the photochromic articles of the present invention are those having an activated absorption maximum within the visible range of greater than 590 nanometers, e.g., between greater than 590 to 700 nanometers. These materials typically exhibit a blue, bluish-green, or bluish-purple color when exposed to ultraviolet light in an appropriate solvent or matrix.  Examples of classes of such substances that are useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, spiro(indoline)naphthoxazines and spiro(indoline)benzoxazines.  These and other classes of such photochromic substances are described in the open literature. See for example, U.S. Patents: 3,562,172; 3,578,602; 4,215,010; 4,342,668; 5,405,958; 4,637,698; 4,931,219; 4,816,584; 4,880,667; 4,818,096.  Also see for example: Japanese Patent Publication 62/195383; and the text, Techniques in Chemistry, Volume III, "Photochromism," Chapter 3, Glenn H. Brown, Editor, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1971.<br>
A second group of organic photochromic substances contemplated for use to form the photochromic articles of the present invention are those having at least one absorption maximum and preferably two absorption maxima, within the visible range of between 400 and less than 500 nanometers. These materials typically exhibit a yellow-orange color when exposed to ultraviolet light in an appropriate solvent or matrix.  Such compounds include certain chromenes, i.e., benzopyrans and naphthopyrans.  Many of such chromenes are described in the open literature, e.g., U.S. Patents 3,567,605; 4,826,977; 5,066,818; 4,826,977; 5,066,818; 5,466,398; 5,384,077; 5,238,931; and 5,274,132.<br>
A third group of organic photochromic substances contemplated for use to form the photochromic articles of the present invention are those having an absorption maximum within the visible range of between 400 to 500 nanometers and<br><br>
-25-                            another absorption maximum within the visible range of between 500 to 700 nanometers.  These materials typically exhibit color(s) ranging from yellow/brown to purple/gray when exposed to ultraviolet light in an appropriate solvent or matrix. Examples of these substances include certain benzopyran compounds, having substituents at the 2-position of the pyran ring and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic ring, such as a benzothieno or benzofurano ring fused to the benzene portion of the benzopyran.  Such materials are the subject of U.S. Patent No. 5,429,774.<br>
Other photochromic substances contemplated are photochromic organo-metal dithizonates, i.e., (arylazo)-thioformic arylhydrazidates, e.g., mercury dithizonates which are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,361,706. Fulgides and fulgimides, e.g. the 3-furyl and 3-thienyl fulgides and fulgimides which are described in U.S. Patent 4,931,220 at column 20, line 5 through column 21, line 38.<br>
The disclosures relating to such photochromic substances in the aforedescribed patents are incorporated herein, in toto,   by reference.  The photochromic articles of the present invention may contain one photochromic substance or a mixture of photochromic substances, as desired.  Mixtures of photochromic substances may be used to attain certain activated colors such as a near neutral gray or brown.<br>
Each of the photochromic substances described herein may be used in amounts and in a ratio (when mixtures are used) such that a polymerizate to which the mixture of compounds is applied or in which they are incorporated exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color such as shades of gray or brown when activated with unfiltered • sunlight, i.e., as near a neutral color as possible given the colors of the activated photochromic substances.  The relative amounts of the aforesaid photochromic substances used will vary and depend in part upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species of such compounds, and the ultimate color desired.<br><br>
-26-<br>
The photochromic compounds or substances described herein may be applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate by various methods described in the art. Such methods include dissolving or dispersing the substance within the polymerizate, e.g., imbibition of the photochromic substance into the polymerizate by immersion of the polymerizate in a hot solution of the photochromic substance or by thermal transfer; providing the photochromic substance as a separate layer between adjacent layers of the polymerizate, e.g., as a part of a polymer film; and applying the photochromic substance as a coating or as part of a coating placed on the surface of the polymerizate.  The term "imbibition" or "imbibe" is intended to mean and include permeation of the photochromic substance alone into the polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of the photochromic substance into a porous polymer, vapor phase transfer, and other such transfer mechanisms.  One example of an imbibing method includes the steps of coating the photochromic article with the photochromic substance; heating the surface of the photochromic article; followed by removing the residual coating from the surface of the photochromic article.<br>
The amount of photochromic substance or composition containing the same applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate is not critical provided that a sufficient amount is used to produce a photochromic effect discernible to the naked eye upon activation.  Generally such amount can be described as a photochromic amount.  The particular amount used depends often upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the method used to incorporate or apply the photochromic substances.  Typically, the more photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the greater is the color intensity.  Generally, the amount of total photochromic substance incorporated into or applied to a photochromic optical polymerizate may. range from 0.15 to 0.35 milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the photochromic substance(s) is incorporated or applied.<br><br>
-27-                             It is also contemplated that photochromic substances may be added to the two-component organic composition prior to polymerizing, e.g., cast curing, the composition.  However, when this is done it is preferred that the photochromic substance(s) be resistant to potentially adverse interactions with, for example, initiator(s) that may be present and / or the isocyanate, isothiocyante and amine groups of the first and second components.  These adverse interactions can result in deactivation of the photochromic substance(s), e.g., by trapping them in either an open or closed form.  Photochromic substances can also include photochromic pigments and organic photochromic substances encapsulated in metal oxides, the latter of which are described in U.S. Patents 4,166,043 and 4,367,170.  Organic photochromic substances sufficiently encapsulated within a matrix of an organic polymerizate, as described in U.S. Patent 4,931,220, may also be incorporated into the two-component composition of the present invention prior to curing.  If photochromic substances are added to the two-component organic composition of the present invention prior to curing, they are typically incorporated into the second component prior to mixing the first and second components together.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Thioglycerol bis (2-mercaptoacetate) is a preferred polythiol monomer of the present invention, in which R1 and R2 are each methylene with reference to general formula I, Thioglycerol bis(2-mercaptoacetate)  was prepared from the following ingredients.<br><br>

Ingredient	Amount (grams)<br>
Charge	1<br>
3-mercapto-l,2-propanediol	1995<br>
2-mercaptoacetic acid	2333<br>
methane sulfonic acid	14.2<br>
Charge	2<br>
aqueous ammonia (a)	4218<br>
(a) An aqueous solution of 5 % by	weight ammonia.<br>
The ingredients of Charge 1 were added to a five liter round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermocouple and heating mantle coupled through a temperature feed-back control device, and a vacuum distillation column.  A vacuum of from 5 to 10 millimeters (mm) of Hg was drawn and the reaction mixture was heated to and held at 70°C for a period of 4 to 5 hours while water was collected from the distillation column.<br>
When no more water was observed to be collected from the distillation column, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a six liter round bottom flask equipped with a motor driven stir-blade, a thermocouple and a water cooled jacket.  Charge 2 was added to the mixture, which was then stirred for 30 to 45 minutes with an accompanying exotherm of from 10°C to 20°C.  Upon cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was left standing to allow the accumulation of an upper ammonia layer, which was removed by suctioning with a pipette.  The remaining lower layer was washed three times each with two liters of deionized water. Vacuum stripping of water from the washed layer yielded 1995 grams of thioglycerol bis(2-mercaptoacetate) in the form of a yellowish oil having a refractive index of 1.5825.<br>

The polyamine second component was diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). The specific molar composition and molar ratio of each component used for each example are summarized in Table 1. Measured physical properties for each example are summarized in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A first component was prepared by mixing 0.6 equivalents of H-MDI with 1 equivalent of DMDS at 90°C for an hour.  While stirring, 0.6 equivalents of XDI were added to the first component.  The mixture was allowed to stir for an additional 1.5 hours to yield the viscous prepolymer. 0.25 equivalents of DETDA were added to the warm prepolymer.  After stirring for Several seconds, the resulting mixture was charged between two flat glass molds. The filled molds were heated to 120°C and maintained at that temperature for 16 hours, yielding a plastic sheet.<br><br>
