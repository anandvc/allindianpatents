FIELD Ol: THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the prevention and/or therapy of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. More specifically, the present invention relates to synthetic polynucleotides encoding HPV58 LI protein, and to recombinant vectors and hosts comprising said polynucleotides. This invention also relates to HPV58 virus-like particles (VLPs), wherein the VLPs are produced by expressing recombinant HPV 58 LI or LI + L2 in yeast cells and to their use in vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions for preventing and treating HPV infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are more than 80 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), many of which have been associated with a wide variety of biological phenotypcs, from benign proliferative warts to malignant carcinomas (for review, see McMurray et al., Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 82(1): 15-33 (2001)). I IPV6 and HPV11 are the types most commonly associated with benign warts, nonmalignant condyloma acuminata and/or low-grade dysplasia of the genital or respiratory mucosa. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the high-risk types most frequently associated with in situ and invasive carcinomas of the cervix, vagina, vulva and anal canal. More than 90% of cervical carcinomas are associated with infections of HPV 16, HPV 18 or the less prevalent oncogenic types HPV31, -33, -45, -52 and -58 (Schiffman et al.,./. Natl. Cancer lust. 85(12): 958-64 (1993)). The observation that HPV DNA is detected in more than 90% of cervical cancers provides strong epidemiological evidence that HPVs cause cervical carcinoma.<br>
Papillomaviruses are small (50-60 nm), nonenveloped, icosahedral DNA viruses that encode up to eight early and two late genes. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the viral genomes are designated El to E7, and LI and L2, where "E" denotes early and "L" denotes late. LI and L2 code for virus capsid proteins, while the E genes are associated with functions such as viral replication and cellular transformation.<br>
The LI protein is the major capsid protein and has a molecular weight of 55-60 kDa. The L2 protein is the minor capsid protein. Immunological data suggest that most of the L2 protein is internal to the LI protein in the virat capsid. Both the LI and L2 proteins arc highly conserved among different papiliomaviruses.<br>
Expression of the LI protein or a combination of the LI and L2 proteins in yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or bacteria leads to self-assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) (for review, see Schiller and Roden, in Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses: Lacey, ed. Leeds, UK: Leeds Medical Information, pp 101-12 (1996)).<br><br>
VLPs are morphologically similar to authentic virions and are capable of inducing high litres of neulrali/ing antibodies upon administration into animals or humans. Because VLPs do not contain the potentially oncogenie viral genome, they present a safe alternative to the use of live virus in I IPV vaccine development (for review, see Schiller and Hidesheim, J. Clin. Virol. 19: 67-74 (2000)). For this reason, the LI and L2 genes have been identified as immunological targets for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for HPV infection and disease.<br>
HPV vaccine development and commerciali/ation have been hindered by difficulties associated with obtaining high expression levels of capsid proteins in successfully transformed host organisms, limiting the production of purified protein. Therefore, despite the identification of wild-type nucleotide sequences encoding I IPV LI proteins such as HPV58 LI protein, it would be highly desirable to develop a readily renewable source of crude HPV LI protein that utilizes HPV58 LI-encoding nucleotide sequences that are optimi/ed for expression in the intended host cell. Additionally, it would be useful to produce large quantities of HPV58 LI VLPs having the immunity-conferring properties of the native proteins for use in vaccine development.<br>

As used throughout the specification and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
As used throughout the specification and appended claims, the following definitions and abbreviations apply:<br>
The term "promoter" refers to a recognition site on a DNA strand to which the RNA polymerase binds. The promoter forms an initiation complex with RNA polymerase to initiate and drive transcriptional activity. The complex can be modified by activating sequences termed "enhancers" or "upstream activating sequences" or inhibiting sequences termed "silencers".<br>
The term "vector" refers to some means by which DNA fragments can be introduced into a host organism or host tissue.  There are various types of vectors including plasmids. viruses (including adenovirus), bacteriophages and cosmids.<br>
The term "cassette" refers to a nucleotide or gene sequence that is to be expressed from a vector, for example, the nucleotide or gene sequence encoding the HPV 58 LI protein. In general, a cassette comprises a gene sequence inserted into a vector which, in some embodiments, provides regulatory sequences for expressing the nucleotide or gene sequence. In other embodiments, the nucleotide or gene sequence provides the regulatory sequences for its expression. In further embodiments, the vector provides some regulatory sequences and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides other regulatory sequences. For<br>
example, the vector can provide a promoter for transcribing the nucleotide or gene sequence and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides a transcription termination sequence. The regulatory sequences which can be provided by the vector include, but are not limited to, enhancers, transcription termination sequences, splice acceptor and donor sequences, introns, ribosome binding sequences, and poly(A) addition sequences.<br>
The designations "58 LI wild-type sequence" and "58 LI wt sequence" refer to the HPV58 LI sequence disclosed herein as SEQ ID NO:3. Although the IIPV 58 LI wild-type sequence has been described previously, it is not uncommon to find minor sequence variations between DNAs obtained from clinical isolates. Therefore, a representative 58 LI wild-type sequence was isolated from clinical samples previously shown to contain HPV 58 DNA (see EXAMPLE 1). The 58 LI wild-type sequence was used as a reference sequence to compare the codon-optimized 58 LI sequences disclosed herein (see FIGURB I).<br>
The designations "HPV 58 LI R" and "58 LI R" refer to an exemplary synthetic HPV58 LI nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:1), disclosed herein, wherein the sequence was rebuilt so that it comprises codons that are preferred for high-level expression by a yeast cell.<br>
The term "effective amount" means sufficient vaccine composition is introduced to produce the adequate levels of the polypeptide, so that an immune response results. One skilled in the art recognizes that this level may vary.<br>
A "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by another, chemically similar, amino acid residue. Examples of such conservative substitutions are: substitution of one hydrophobic residue (isoleucine, leucine, valine, or methionine) for another; substitution of one polar residue for another polar residue of the same charge (e.g., arginine for lysine; glutamic acid for aspartic acid).<br>
The term "mammalian" refers to any mammal, including a human being. "VLP" or "VLPs" mean(s) virus-like particle or virus-like particles.<br>
"Synthetic" means that the HPV58 LI gene was created so that it contains a sequence of nucleotides that is not the same as the sequence of nucleotides present in the designated naturally occurring wild-type HPV58 LI gene (58 LI wt, SEQ ID NO:3). As stated above, synthetic molecules are provided herein comprising a sequence of nucleotides comprising codons that are preferred for expression by yeast cells. The synthetic molecules provided herein encode the same amino acid sequences as the wild-type HPV58 LI gene (SEQ IDNO:2). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

The majority of cervical carcinomas are associated with infections of specific oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV). The present invention relates to compositions and methods to elicit or enhance immunity to the protein products expressed by genes of oncogenic FIPV types. Specifically, the present invention provides polynucleotides encoding HPV58 LI, wherein the polynucleotides are codon-optimized for high-level expression in yeast. The present invention also provides HPV58 virus-like particles (VLPs), which are produced in yeast, and discloses use of said polynucleotides and VLPs in pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines for the prevention and/or treatment of HPV-associatcd cancer.<br>
A wild-type IIPV58  1.1   nucleotide sequence has been<br>
reported (Genbank Accession # NC 001443, see Kirii et al. Virology 185( 1): 424-427 (1991)). The present invention provides synthetic DNA molecules encoding the HPV58 LI protein. The synthetic molecules of the present invention comprise a sequence of codons, wherein at least some of the codons have been altered to use the codons preferred by a yeast cell for high-level expression. The synthetic molecules may be used as a coding sequence for expression of IIPV58 1,1 protein, which may self-assemble into VLPs. Said VLPs may be used in a VLP-bascd vaccine to provide effective immunoprophylaxis against papillomavirus infection through neutrali/ing antibody and cell-mediated immunity. Such VLP-based vaccines are also useful for treatment of already established HPV infections.<br>
Hxpression of HPV VLPs in yeast cells offers the advantages of being cost-effective and easily adapted to large-scale growth in fermenlers. In addition, the yeast genome can be readily altered to ensure selection of rccombinant, transformed yeast with increased growth and expression potential. However, many HPV LI proteins, including HPV58 LI are expressed at levels in yeast cells which are lower than what is desirable for commercial scale-up.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to HPV58 LI gene sequences that are "optimi/ed" for high-level expression in a yeast cellular environment.<br>
A "triplet" codon of four possible nucleotide bases can exist in over 60<br>
variant forms. Because these codons provide the message for only 20 different amino acids (as well as transcription initiation and termination), some amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon, a phenomenon known as codon redundancy. For reasons not completely understood, alternative codons are not uniformly present in the endogenous DNA of differing types of cells. Indeed, there appears to exist a variable natural hierarchy or "preference" for certain codons in certain types of cells. As one example, the amino acid leucine is specified by any of six DNA codons including CTA, CTC, CTG, C'lT, TTA, and TTG. Exhaustive analysis of genome codon use frequencies for microorganisms has revealed endogenous DNA of E. coli most commonly contains the CTG leucine-specifying codon, while the DNA of yeasts and slime molds most commonly includes a TTA leucine-specifying codon. In view of this hierarchy, it is generally believed that the likelihood of obtaining high levels of expression of a leucine-rich polypeptide by an E. coli host will depend to some extent on the frequency of codon use. For example, it is likely that a gene rich in TTA codons will be poorly expressed in E. coli. whereas a CTG rich gene will probably be highly expressed in this host. Similarly, a preferred codon for expression of a leucine-rich polypeptide in yeast host cells would be TTA.<br>
The implications of codon preference phenomena on recombinant DNA techniques are manifest, and the phenomenon may serve to explain many prior failures to achieve high expression levels of exogenous genes in successfully transformed host organisms--a less "preferred" codon may be repeatedly present in the inserted gene and the host cell machinery for expression may not operate as efficiently. This phenomenon suggests that synthetic genes which have been designed to include a projected host cell's preferred codons provide an optimal form of foreign genetic material for practice of recombinant protein expression. Thus, one aspect of this invention is an HPV58 LI gene that is codon-optimi/ed for high-level expression in a yeast cell. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, it has been found that the use of alternative codons encoding the same protein sequence may remove the constraints on expression of IIPV58 LI proteins by yeast cells.<br>
In accordance with this invention, HPV58 LI gene segments were converted to sequences having identical translated sequences but with alternative codon usage as described by Sharp and Cowe (Synonymous Codon Usage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast 7: 657-678 (1991)), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The methodology generally consists of identifying codons in the wild-type sequence that are not commonly associated with highly expressed yeast genes and replacing them with optimal codons for high expression in yeast cells. The new gene sequence is then inspected for undesircd sequences generated by these codon replacements (e.g., "ATTTA" sequences, inadvertent creation of intron splice recognition sites, unwanted restriction enzyme sites, high GC content, presence of transcription termination signals that are recognized by yeast, etc.). Undesirable sequences are eliminated by substitution of the existing codons with different codons coding for the same amino acid. The synthetic gene segments are then tested for improved expression.<br>
The methods described above were used to create synthetic gene segments for HPV58 LI, resulting in a gene comprising codons optimized for high-level expression. While the above procedure provides a summary of our methodology for designing codon-optimized genes for use in IIPV vaccines, it is understood by one skilled in the art that similar vaccine efficacy or increased expression of genes may be achieved by minor variations in the procedure or by minor variations in the sequence.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a synthetic polynucleotide comprising a sequence of nucleotides encoding an IIPV58 LI protein, or a biologically active fragment or mutant form of an HPV58 LI protein, the polynucleotide sequence comprising codons optimized for expression in a yeast host cell. Said mutant forms of the HPV58 LI protein include, but arc not limited to: conservative amino acid substitutions, amino-terminal truncations, carboxy-terminal truncations, deletions, or additions. Any such biologically active<br>
fragment and/or mutant will encode either a protein or protein fragment which at least substantially mimics the immunological properties of the HPV58 LI protein as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. The synthetic polynucleotides of the present invention encode mRNA molecules that express a functional HPV58 LI protein so as to be useful in the development of a therapeutic or prophylactic MPV vaccine.<br>
One aspect of this invention is a codon-optimized nucleic acid molecule which encodes the HPV58 LI protein as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, said nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of nucleotides as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors and recombinant host cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, which contain the nucleic acid molecules disclosed throughout this specification. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the host cell is a yeast host cell.<br>
The synthetic HPV58 DNA or fragments thereof constructed through the methods described herein may be recombinantly expressed by molecular cloning into an expression vector containing a suitable promoter and other appropriate transcription regulatory elements, and transferred into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells to produce recombinant HPV58 LI. Techniques for such manipulations arc fully described by Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, (1989); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., Green Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1988); Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual, Rose et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, (1990)), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a process for expressing an HPV58 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an HPV58 LI protein into a yeast host cell; and (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV58 LI protein.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for expressing an HPV58 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an HPV58 LI protein into a yeast host cell; wherein the nucleic acid molecule is codon-optimi/ed for optimal expression in the yeast host cell and; (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV58 LI protein.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for expressing an HPV58 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid as set forth in SEQ ID NO: I into a yeast host cell; and, (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV58 LI protein.<br>
The synthetic genes of the present invention can be assembled into an expression cassette that comprises sequences designed to provide efficient expression of the HPV58 Li protein in the host cell. The cassette preferably contains the synthetic gene, with related transcriptional and translations control sequences opcratively linked to it, such as a promoter, and termination sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is the S. cerevisiae GAIJ promoter, although those skilled in the art will recogni/e that any of a number of other known yeast promoters such as the GAL 10, GAL7, ADHI, TDH3 or PGK promoters, or other eukaryotic gene promoters may be used. A preferred transcriptional terminator is the S. cerevi.siae ADHI terminator, although other known transcriptional terminators may also be used. The combination of GAL] promoter -ADHI terminator is particularly preferred.<br>
This invention further provides an isolated and purified HPV 58 LI polypcptidc comprising a sequence of amino acids as set forth in SHQ ID NO:2.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is an UPV58 virus-like particle (VLP) produced by recombinantly expressing the I1PV58 LI or LI I L2 genes in a yeast cell, methods of producing HPV58 VLPs, and methods of using HPV58 VLPs. VLPs can self-assemble when LI, the major capsid protein of human and animal papillomaviruscs, is expressed in yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or bacteria (for review, see Schiller and Roden, in Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses; Lacey, ed. Leeds, UK: Leeds Medical Information, pp 101-12 (1996)). Morphologically indistinct HPV VLPs can also be produced by expressing a combination of the LI and L2 capsid proteins. VLPs are composed of 72 pentamers of LI in a T=7 icosahedral structure (Baker et al., Biophys. J. 60(6): 1445-56(1991)).<br>
VLPs are morphologically similar to authentic virions and are capable of inducing high litres of neutralizing antibodies upon administration into an animal. Immuni/ation of rabbits (Breitblird et al.,./. Virol. 69(6): 3959-63 (1995)) and dogs (Suzich et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92(25): 11553-57 (1995)) with VLPs was shown to both induce neutrali/ing antibodies and protect against experimental papillomavirus infection. However, because the VLPs do not contain the potentially oncogenic viral genome and can self-assemble when expressed from a single gene, they present a safe alternative to the use of live virus in HPV vaccine development (for review, see Schiller and Hidesheim,./. Clin. Virol. 19: 67-74 (2000)).<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to virus-like particles comprised of rccombinant LI protein or recombinant LI I L2 proteins of HPV58, wherein the recombinant protein is expressed in a yeast cell.<br>

Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is lo be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
The following examples illustrate, but do not limit the invention. LXAMPLL 1 Determination of a Representative HPV 58 LI Sequence<br>
The HPV 58 LI sequence has been described previously (Gcnbank Accession # NC 001443). It is not uncommon, however, to find minor sequence variations between DNAs obtained from clinical isolates. To determine a representative IIPV58 LI wild-type sequence, DNA was isolated from three clinical samples previously shown to contain HPV 58 DNA. HPV 58 LI sequences were amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase and the following primers: HPV_58JJ_F 5' - A T G T C C G T G T G G C G G C C T A G T -3' (SBQ ID NO:4) and SJJVJlJBgUi 5'-GAGATCTGTGTAAGTACCACAAC A A T T A 3" (SKQ ID NO:5). The amplified products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visuali/cd by ethidium bromide staining. The ~ 1500 bp LI bands were excised and DNA purified using Geneclean Spin Kit (Q-Bio Gene, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA was then ligated to the TA cloning vector, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). TOPI OF' E. Coli were transformed with the ligation mixture and plated on LB agar with ampicillin plus IPTG and X-gal for blue/white colony selection. The plates were inverted and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. White colonies were cultured in LB medium with ampicillin by shaking at 37°C for 16 hours. Minipreps were performed to extract the plasmid DNA.<br>
To demonstrate the presence of the LI gene in the plasmids, restriction endonuclease digestions were conducted. Restriction fragments were viewed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. DNA sequencing was performed on plasmids containing cloned LI inserts from each of the three clinical isolates. In order to generate a reference sequence for later optimization, the nucleotidc and translated amino acid sequences from each of the clones were compared to the published HPV 58 LI sequences. Sequence analysis of the three clinical isolates revealed that no sequence was identical to the Genbank sequence. The pCR2.1 HPV 58LI clone 1/4 was chosen to be the representative 58 LI sequence and is referred to interchangeably herein as the "58 LI wild-type sequence" or "58 wt sequence" (SKQ ID NO:3, see FIGURE 1). The 58 LI wt sequence contained five point mutations: two resulting in amino acids changes and three silent point mutations. The point mutations resulting in amino acid changes with respect to the Genbank HPV 58 LI sequence were located at nuclcotide 372 (A-&gt;T), altering amino acid 124 from Icucine to phenylalanine, and nuclcotide 897 (A-&gt;G), altering amino acid 299 from isoleucine to methionine. The three silent point mutations were located at nucleotides 774 (A-&gt;G), 792 (T-&gt;C), and 999 (G-&gt;A).<br>
The 58 LI wild-type sequence was PCR-amplificd using Taq polymerase and the following primers, which add Bamlll extensions: 5'58 Bam HI 5' GGGATCCCAC A A A A C A A A A I G T C C G T G T G G C 3' (SHQ ID NO:6) and 3' Bam 58 5' G G G A I' C C G I G I A A G T A C C A C A A C A A T T A 3'(SHQ ID NO: 7). The resulting PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by ethidium<br>
bromide staining. The ~ 1500 bp band was excised and DNA-purificd using the Geneclean kit. The PCR product was then ligated to pCRl.l and TOPI OF' cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. White colonies were selected and cultured in LB medium with ampicillin by shaking at 37°C for 16 hours. Minipreps were performed to extract the plasmid DNA. To release the HPV 58 Lt gene from the vector sequences, Bamlil restriction endonuclease digestions were performed. The digested DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and viewed by ethidium bromide staining. The LI band was purified using the Geneclean kit and ligated to dephosphorylated, flamHI digested pGALUO. DH5a E.coli cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. To screen for the HPV 58 LI insert in the correct orientation, plasmid DNA from colonies was PCR-amplified. DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence and orientation of the inserts. A single clone was selected and named pGALllO-IIPV 58L1 #10. Maxiprep DNA from the selected clone was prepared. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were made competent by spheroplasting with glusulase and transformed with pGALUO-HPV 58LI #1. The yeast transformation mixture was plated in Leu(-) sorbitol top-agar onto Leu(-) sorbitol agar plates and incubated inverted for 3-5 days at 30°C. Colonies were picked and streaked for isolation on Leu(-) sorbitol agar plates. Isolated colonies were subsequently grown in 5 ml of 5 X Leu(-) Ade(-) sorbitol with 1.6% glucose and 4% galactose in rotating tube cultures at 30"C to induce 58 LI transcription and protein expression. EXAMPLE 2 Yeast codon optimization<br>
Yeast-preferred codons have been described (Sharp, Paul M and Cowe, Elizabeth. Synonymous Codon Usage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YEAST 7: 657-678 (1991)). Expression of the HPV 58 LI wt protein was detectable, however to obtain increased expression, the HPV 58 L! gene was rebuilt utili/ing the preferred yeast codons. The rebuilt 58 LI sequence, which comprises yeast-optimixed codon sequences, contained 404 nucleotide alterations compared to the 58 LI wt sequence. The resulting sequence is referred to herein as "58 LI R" (R ^ rebuild, see FIGURE 1). The translated amino acid sequence of 58 LI R was not altered. The nucleotide (SEQ ID NO: I) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO:2) sequences of HPV 58 LI R are shown in FIGURE 2. Said rebuilt sequence provides increased HPV 58 LI expression, which is a significant advance over the wild-type for use in vaccine development (sec EXAMPLE 4).<br>
The strategy employed to produce the optimized gene was to design long overlapping sense and antisense oligomers that span the gene, substituting nucleotides with yeast-preferred codon sequences, while maintaining the amino acid sequence. These<br>
oligomcrs were used in place of template DNA in a PCR reaction with Pfu polymerase. Additional amplification primers were designed and used to amplify the rebuilt sequences from template oligomers.<br>
The optimal conditions for amplification were section-specific, however, most employed a program resembling 95°C for 2 minutes (denaturing) followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 1 minute (denaturing), 55°C for 1 minute (annealing), 72°C for 3.5 minute (extension), followed by a 72°C for 10 minute final extension and 4°C hold. PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of the appropriate size were excised and DNA gel purified. The amplified fragments were then used as templates to assemble the 1497 nt rebuilt HPV 58 LI gene.<br>
Following rebuild, the 1497 nt band was gel purified and ligated to pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following ligation, TOP10 cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. Colonies were grown in LB with kanamycin and plasmid DNA was extracted from the colonies by miniprep techniques. The plasmid DNA was sequenced to confirm the desired 58 LI rebuild changes. To add Bamlil extensions to both ends, the 58 LI R (rebuild) was re-amplified from pCR-Blunt-58 LI R with the following primers: 5'Bam 58 Rebuild 5' -G G A T C C C A C A A A A C A A A A T G T C T G T C T G G A G A C C - 3' (SLQ ID N0:8) and 3'Bam 58 Rebuild 51 -GGATCCT T A C T T C T T G A C C T T C 3' (SLQ IDNO:9).The amplified LI product was gel-purified using the Geneclean kit and cloned into pCR2.l (Invitrogen). Top I OF' cells were transformed with the pCR2.l plasmid. White colonies were cultured in LB medium with ampicillin, shaking at 37°C for 16 hours. Miniprcps were performed to extract the plasmid DNA. To release the HPV 58 LI gene from the vector sequences, Bam\\\ restriction endonuclease digestions were performed. The digested DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and viewed by ethidium bromide staining. The LI band was purified using the Geneclean kit and ligated to dephosphorylated, Baml 11 -digested pGALI 10. DU5a E.coli cells were transformed with the ligation mixture.<br>
The resulting colonies were screened by PCR for the HPV 58 LI insert in the correct orientation. Maxiprep DNA was prepared. Sequence and orientation were confirmed by restriction digest profiles and DNA sequencing. The selected clone was named pGALI 10-HPV 58L1R # 17. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were made competent by spheroplasting and transformed with pGALI 10-HPV 58LIR //17. The yeast transformation was plated in Leu(-) sorbitol top-agar on Leu(-) sorbitol agar plates and incubated inverted for 3-5 days at 30°C. Colonies were picked and streaked for clonal isolation on Leu(-) sorbitol agar plates. Isolated colonies were subsequently grown in 5 ml of 5 X Leu(-) Adc(-) sorbitol with 1.6% glucose and<br>
4% galactose in rotating tube cultures at 30"C to induce LI   transcription and protein expression. After 48 hours, a culture volume equivalent to an ODgOO     '0 amount of cells was pelleted, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were frozen and stored at -70°C, LXAMPLH3 RNA preparation<br>
Cell pellets of transformed yeast cells induced to express HPV 58 LI or HPV 58 LI R by galactose induction were thawed on ice, suspended in 0.8 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL) and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. One fifth volume of chloroform was added to the vial. It was then shaken vigorously for 15 seconds to mix and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. After a 5 minute centrifugation at 13 k rpms, the upper phase was collected and transferred to a new vial. 0.4 ml isopropanol was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. To pellet the RNA, centrifugation was performed at 13 k rpms for 10 minutes. The supernatant was decanted, the RNA pellet washed with 75% KtOH and centrifugation repeated. The supernatant was decanted and the RNA pellet allowed to air dry for 15 minutes followed by suspension in RNase-free water. Spectrophotometry was performed to determined the concentration of RNA in the sample using the assumption that an A260 reading of I - 40 g/ml RNA when the A260/280 's 1-7-2.0.<br>
HXAMPLH4 Northern Blot Analysis<br>
A 1.1% agarose formaldehyde gel was cast. Five and ten micrograms of RNA were combined with denaturing buffer (final concentrations: 6% formaldehyde, 50% formamide and 0.1 x MOPS) and heated to 65"C for 10 minutes. A one-tenth volume of gel loading buffer was added and the sample loaded onto the gel. Blectrophoresis was performed at 75 volts in 1 x MOPS buffer for ~ 3 hours. The gel was washed for 60 minutes in 10 x SSC.<br>
The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N t nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences. Piscataway, NJ) by capillary action over 16 hours in 10 x SSC. The RNA was then fixed to the nylon membrane by cross-linking using the Slratagene UV Stratalinker auto-crosslink function (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After fixing, the nylon membrane was allowed to air dry.<br>
The Roche DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit I (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Swit/erland) was used to label 58 LI wt and 58 LI R DNA sequences with DIG to be used as a probe cocktail to delect 58 LI wt and 58 LI R transcripts on the Northern blot. The pre-hybridi/ation, hybridi/ation and immunological development using an anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody were performed per the manufacturer's<br>
recommendations. Briefly, the blot was pre-hybridi/ed at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. The probe cocktail was denatured by heating to 95°C for 5 minutes and quenching on ice. The probe cocktail was added to the hybridi/.ation solution and applied to the membrane for 4 hours at 44.6"C with gentle shaking. The hybridization solution was then removed and the blot washed 2 x for 5 minutes \n2x SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by an additional wash at 65°C with 0.5 \ SSC and 0.1% SDS. The blot was then blocked for 30 minutes and anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody was applied at a 1:5000 dilution for 30 minutes. The blot was washed and the presence of probe-bound RNA was determined by NBT/BCIP substrate detection of the alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG bound antibody.<br>
Initial analysis of yeast expressing 58 LI wt suggested that there was functional HPV 58 LI full-length transcription and translation; however, the level of expression might be increased if the sequence was rebuilt with yeast-preferred codon sequences. The rebuilt 58 LI sequence was engineered to omit any possible premature transcription termination sites to ensure robust transcription.   Northern blot analysis of the 58 LI R transcript revealed that increased amounts of full-length transcripts were generated compared to the results seen for 58 LI wMFIGURI 3). HXAMPLL5 HPV 58 LI Protein Expression<br>
l;ro/.en yeast cell pellets of galactose-induccd cultures equivalent to an ODgOO    '0 quantity of cells, were thawed on ice and suspended in 300     1 of PC buffer (100 mM Na2HP()4 and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.0) with 2mM PMSF. Acid-washed 0.5mm glass beads were added at a concentration of- 0.5g/tubc. The tubes were vorlexed for 3 cycles of 5 minutes at 4°C with a 1 minute break.   7.5    1 of 20% TritonXlOO was added and the vortex step was repeated for 5 minutes at 4°C.   The lubes were placed on ice for 15 minutes, followed by centrilugation lor 10 minutes at 4°C. The supcrnate was transferred to a sterile microfuge tube, labeled as total yeast protein extract, dated and stored at -70°C. HXAMPLL6 Western Blot Analysis<br>
Total yeast protein extract from twenty isolated yeast colonies for each 58 LI construct were analy/ed by Western blot to confirm expression of 58 LI protein after galactose induction.<br>
'fen, live and two and one-hall" micrograms of total yeast protein extract of representative 58 LI wt and 58 LI R isolates were combined with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 95"C for 10 minutes. The 16 LI protein, which is approximately 55 kD, was<br>
included as a positive control, along with HPV LI-free total yeast protein extract as a negative control (data not shown).<br>
The proteins were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed in Tris-Glycine buffer. After protein separation, the proteins were Western transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose and the blot was blocked in 1 x diluent buffer (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for I hour at room temperature with rocking. The blot was washed three times and incubated at room temperature for 16 hours with yeast absorbed goat anti-trpE-HPV 31 LI serum, which cross-reacts with HPV 16 and HPV 58 Lt proteins. The blot was then washed three times and incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of anti-goat-HRP conjugated antibody for 1 hr. The blot was again washed three times and NBT/BCIP detection substrate applied (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Immunoreactive proteins were detected as purple bands on the blot.<br>
In all cases, the 58 LI protein was detected as a distinct immunoreactive band on the nitrocellulose corresponding to approximately 55 kD (FIGURB 4). The intensity of the 58 LI R bands appeared to be greater than that seen for 58 LI wt , suggesting improved 58 LI expression was achieved by yeast-codon optimization. EXAMPLE 7 ELISA Assay<br>
To demonstrate 58 LI VLP expression, a portion of 58 LI wt and 58 LI R total yeast protein extract was analyzed by ELISA. The yeast cells expressing HPV 58 LI and HPV 58 LI R were grown by a variety of methods, including rotating tube cultures, shake flasks, and fermenters. The yeast cells were lyscd and protein extracts were made to determine the amount of HPV 58 LI virus-like particles (VLPs) produced per microgram of total protein. A sandwich ELISA was designed to demonstrate HPV 58 LI VLP expression.<br>
Protein G purified H582C3.F7 (F7) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used to bind intact 58 Li VLPs found in the yeast protein extracts. F7 specifically recognizes an HPV 58 LI VLP conformational epitope. The unbound proteins were washed away and H586E11.F4 (F4), another HPV 58 LI VLP conformational specific mAb, was applied as a detection antibody. True, conformationally correct, 58 LI VLPs were bound and detection was facilitated by the use of an anti-mouse IgG2b HRP-conjugated antibody and TMB substrate.<br>
Specifically, F7 was used to coat the bottom of Immulon 4 HBX 96 well plates overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, followed by blocking with blocking solution (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + 1% BSA). The plates were washed three times and antigens (total yeast cell lysates diluted in blocking solution to 12.5 g /ml) were applied to row A in duplicate. Reference standards of purified HPV 58 LI<br>
VLPs were applied to row A columns 3 and 4 at 206ng/ml in 12.5 g/ml total yeast protein. The reference and test samples were then serially diluted two-fold down each column. After three hours at room temperature, the excess antigen was removed by aspiration and the plates were washed 3 times. F4 conformational specific mAb was diluted in blocking solution and applied to each well for one hour at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and an anti-mouse lgG2b MRP-conjugated antibody was diluted in blocking solution and applied for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed and TMB (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) was applied for 5 minutes to detect HRP-conjugated antibody complexes. The detection reaction was stopped with the addition of 2M M2SO4. Plates were read at 450 nm wavelength and the concentration of IIPV 58 LI VLP was determined by comparison to the reference standards in ng VLP / g total protein.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows a comparison of the amount of VLPs detected/  g of total protein from yeast expressing MPV 58 LI  wt and MPV 58  LI   R  from two separate experiments.    IIPV 58 LI   VLP expression levels increased -2-3  fold with yeast-codon optimi/ation EXAMPLH 8 Transmission Llectron Microscopy<br>
To demonstrate that the 58 LI protein was in fact self-assembling to form pentameric-Ll capsomers, which in turn self-assemble into virus-like particles, a partially purified 58 LI R protein extract was subjected to transmission electron microscopy (EM).<br>
Yeast were grown under small scale fermentation and pelleted. The resulting pellets were subjected to purification treatments. Pellet and clarified yeast extracts were analy/cd by immunoblot to demonstrate LI protein expression and retention through the purification procedure. Clarified yeast extracts were then subjected to centrifugation over a 45%-sucrose cushion and the resulting pellet suspended in buffer for analysis by transmission EM.<br>
A representative image of the 58 LI R VLPs produced is shown in FIGURE 6. The diameter of the spherical particles in this crude sample ranged from 30 to 60 nm, with some particles displaying a regular array of capsomers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
