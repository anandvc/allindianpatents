<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing<br>
aluminium citrate in orally administrable form effective against gastro<br>
intestinal disorders. More particularly, this invention pertains to a new<br>
cost-effective route for arriving at a valuable ingredient like aluminium<br>
citrate showing pronounced effectiveness against gastro-intestinal<br>
disorders, which is capable of controlling and modulating the absorption<br>
of non-essential and potentially toxic trace elements from the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract.<br>
It has been observed that at least two factors assume<br>
importance if enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of aluminium is to<br>
occur. First, the aluminium compound must be soluble at the pH of the<br>
intestinal fluid, and second, the compound in question must result in the<br>
opening of cellular tight junctions. Aluminium citrate's high formation<br>
constant, which precludes the formation of insoluble aluminium<br>
hydroxide or phosphate in association with its ability to open junctions,<br>
probably accounts for its high degree of gastrointestinal absorption.<br>
Aluminium also binds to mucus glycoproteins, at least at acid<br>
pH, probably via sialic acid end-groups, even though this aspect is still<br>
being studied, so direct interaction with monomeric aluminium, or<br>
stabilization of a polymeric, probably colloidal, species are both possible.<br>
Hence, the solution chemistry of dietary aluminium in the lumen of the<br>
gastro intestinal track will be dictated by competition from endogenous<br>
factors, such as mucins, albumin and citrate and exogenous (dietary)<br>
factors. Other potential routes for uptake of aluminium include perception,<br>
endocytosis by mucosal cells or conventional transcellular transport of<br>
hydrophobic or very small hydrophilic species. Certain dietary cofactors<br>
undoubtedly affect absorption of aluminium, although their role in the<br>
diet may be considerably less that when studied in isolation. In conclusion,<br>
it has been established that citric acid promotes systemic absorption of<br>
aluminium.<br>
Heretofore aluminium citrate was prepared from aluminium<br>
chloride employed as the starting compound. Apart from being a partially<br>
co-valent compound, its degree of hydrolysis with subsequent reaction<br>
with free citric acid was considerably time consuming. The chloride route<br>
had another drawback in view of the release of a strong acid like<br>
hydrochloric acid in the course of reaction. Besides, in this part of India,<br>
<br>
 <br>
cost of aluminium chloride is quite considerable, which factor plays a<br>
major role in commercial production of aluminium citrate.<br>
Heretofore liquid aluminium citrate in a stabilized solution<br>
state was being prepared and used for arriving at ethical, pharmaceutical<br>
and/or veterinary preparations. In European Patent No. 0040763 there is<br>
described a method involving combining a solution of aluminium chloride<br>
with a solution of citric acid under vigorous agitation. After formation of<br>
aluminium citrate solution, sufficient quantity of alkali metal or<br>
ammonium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture to raise the pH<br>
to a level of 5.0 to 7.0. During addition of the base, agitation was continued<br>
and temperature was kept low.<br>
As discussed earlier, accessing the starting material, namely,<br>
aluminium chloride posed a difficulty and the reaction parameters also<br>
needed close monitoring. Such conditions pose difficulty in translating the<br>
conventional procedure into commercial scale in this part of the country.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to evolve a<br>
procedure to overcome the difficulties envisaged in the prior art.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a process which<br>
employs an easily accessible, inexpensive starting compound like potash<br>
alum and citric acid of C.P. grade.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a process<br>
for preparing orally administrable aluminium citrate solution which is<br>
both storage stable and cost effective.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention<br>
which relates to a process for preparing aluminium citrate in orally<br>
administrable form effective against gastrointestinal disorders,<br>
characterized in that the said process comprises -<br>
(a)	dissolving potash alum [K2 Al2 (SO4)3, 24 H2O] by heating in<br>
water until a clear solution results;<br>
(b)	adding solid or powdery sodium bicarbonate in water and<br>
boiling the mixture until dissolution results;<br>
<br>
 <br>
(c)	mixing solutions (a) and (b) in stoichiometric proportions<br>
under stirring and allowing the thus formed precipitate to<br>
settle for a period varying between 6 and 8 hours without<br>
agitation;<br>
(d)	decanting the supernatant liquid followed by washing of the<br>
precipitate with distilled water until the wash liquid is free<br>
from SO4" ions;<br>
(e)	adding citric acid solution to the reaction mass obtained<br>
from step (d), boiling the reaction medium to a temperature<br>
not exceeding 90° under gentle stirring, and adjusting the<br>
pH between 6 and 7;<br>
(f)	cooling the reaction medium to ambient temperature,<br>
filtering, if necessary, and storing the final solution of<br>
aluminium citrate in orally administrable form followed by<br>
transferring the solution into suitable receptacles in<br>
predetermined volumes prior to dispatch to outlets.<br>
In the sequence of reactions as outlined above, stirring is<br>
needed in a couple of constituent steps. The speed of stirring is primarily<br>
dependent on the degree of viscosity of the reaction medium, which is<br>
optimally adjusted at around 50 r.p.m.<br>
The aqueous solutions resulting from both steps (a) and (b)<br>
are subjected to filtration to remove undissolved impurities by employing<br>
a filtering medium of clear membrance with an optimum pore size of<br>
0.25µ.<br>
The pH of the final solution of aluminium citrate is allowed to<br>
revert to 4-5, and the specific gravity of the solution sent for storage is<br>
adjusted to a value of approximately 1.02.<br>
Furthermore, the precipitate of aluminium hydroxide formed<br>
in step (c) stated above is allowed to be converted into aluminium<br>
hydroxide gel in the course of washing with water to render it free from<br>
SO4" ions, prior to reaction with citric acid.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Testing procedure:<br>
About 0.2 gm is weighed accurately and dissolved in 3.4 ml of<br>
hydrochloric acid (1:1) and 50 ml. of water. 50 ml. of 0.05 M EDTA is<br>
added. The solution is rendered neutral to methyl red/ethanol T.S. with<br>
sodium hydroxide solution. The solution is heated on a water bath for 30<br>
minutes, cooled and about 50 mg of xylenol orange indicator mixture R<br>
and 5gm of methenamine R are added and the excess EDTA is back<br>
titrated with 0.05 lead nitrate solution till the yellow solution turns pink<br>
violate.<br>
Each ml. of 0.05 EDTA v.s. is equivalent to 1.349 mg. of<br>
aluminium.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with<br>
reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled<br>
in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein<br>
without deviating or departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit the obvious<br>
equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
Having described the invention in detail with particular<br>
reference to the illustrations given above, it will now be more specifically<br>
defined by means of claims appended hereafter.<br>
