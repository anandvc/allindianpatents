				<td>The indention relates to the field of porous silicas and particularly of modified porous silicas usable especially as additives to liquid paints and as carriers for pigments and/or dyes.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In order to improve the abrasion resistance and the scratch resistance of paints, various additives are added, which include especially silica 'powders and/or polyamide powdejrs.<br>
However], the use of silica powders is limited, on the one hand, because of the sedimentation which takes place within the paints into which they are introduced and, on the other hand, because.of their low resistance to crayoning (ability of a paint-covered surface to be marked after being rubbed with an object, especially metallic; this phenomenon being all the more visible when the paint is light in tint) . To improve the dispersion of the silica powders and to limit their sedimentation within paints, this being in order to obtain better stability of the said paints, it has been proposed to modify the silica powders, for example by addition of polyethylene waxes, but the mixture is tricky to produce and this technical solution does not produce any improvements insofar as the other weak points referred to above are concerned.<br>
Polyamide (PA) powders exhibit excellent abrasion and scratch resistance properties but their presence in paints generally does not improve the resistance to crayoning either. In addition, milling polyamide resins to the desired particle size - of the 1 order of a few tens of firn - is sometimes found to be tricky when the said PA powders are obtained by polycondensation. PA powders of the desired particle size can be Obtained directly without subsequent<br>
i<br>
grinding,  by  anionic  polymerization  and  especially<br>
according to the process described in Patent Application FR 2 619 385 or in Patent EP 303 530.<br>
The paints containing silica powder and polyamide powder, described in Kansai Paint Go's Patent Application JP 62074970 offer a compromise which is correct but still insufficient insofar as the abrasion, scratch and crayoning resistance is concerned.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the modified silica having a pore volume of between 0.4 and 2 ml/g, an absorptivity, measured according to DIN ISO standard 787/V of between 100 and 350 g of oil/100 g of silica, mean particle diameter of between 0.5 and 150 µm; comprising the steps:<br>
a)	solubilizing at least one polyamide monomer such as herinbefore described at ambient<br>
temperature in an aqueous or hydroalcoholic solution, then adding the porous silica    and<br>
removing the solvent<br>
mixing at least one polyamide monomer in the powder form with the porous silica dry at ambient temperature<br>
b)	polymerizing the at least one said polyamide monomer to obtain the required modified silica in<br>
which the pores are at least partially filled with polyamide resins.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Applicant have now found modified silicas which can be used especially as additives for paints (liquid or otherwise) and as carriers for dyes or pigments.<br>
The modified silicas according to the invention simultaneously improve the abrasion, scratch and crayoning resistance of the paints in which they are incorporated. They consist of porous silica in which the pores are at least partially filled with polyamide resins and whose PA/silica mass ratio is between 1/100 and 2/1.<br>
The porous silicas from which the modified silicas according to the invention originate have a pore volume of between 0.4 and 2 ml/g, an absorptivity,<br>
measured according to DIN standard ISO 787/V of between<br>
i<br>
100 and 350 g of oil/100 g of silica of mean particle diameter of between 0.5 and 150 µm, preferably between 1 and 20 µm. Such porous silicas can be prepared by reaction of sulphuric acid with a sodium silicate and then washing^ grinding and drying of the powders obtained. It is possible to employ as raw material porous silical powders which have undergone an organic coating such as, for example, coating with the aid of polyethylene waxes.<br>
Uncoa^ed porous silicas are preferred by the Applicant Company.<br>
Porous silicas, coated or otherwise, are marketed especially by Grace under the mark Syloid and by J. Crossfield &amp; Sons.<br>
The polyamide resins which occupy at least a portion of the volume of the pores of the modified<br>
silicas according to the invention are semicrystalline PAs whose melting point or range is in general between 80 and 275°; they are in general prepared from diacids and diamines and/or from aminoacids and/or from<br>
lactams,  among! which 11-aminoundecanoic acid will be<br>
I mentioned very particularly.<br>
Another subject-matter of the present invention is two processes for the preparation of the modified silicas according to the invention.<br>
The first process developed by the Applicant Company consists in solubilizing the monomers of the polyamide resin in an aqueous or hydroalcoholic solution containing an alcohol which has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. For the solubilization of the said monomers it Is sometimes necessary to operate at temperatures which are higher than the ambient temperature but lower than the boiling temperature of the solvent, bnce the solubilization of the monomers has been completed, the porous silica is added in a quantity such that all the solution is absorbed by the silica powderi The solvent is removed by placing, for example, the silica powder in an oven or in a drier in the usual operating conditions for the removal of water or of a water/alcohol mixture (high temperatures, more or less deep vacuum).<br>
The polymerization of the PAs is next carried out by heating the powder to temperatures allowing the PA monomer(s) to melt, typically between 100 and 260°C for a period which can vary according to the chosen polymerization temperature and is in general between a few minutes and a few hours. Using techniques which are known per se, the polymerization reaction can be accelerated by applying a vacuum to the polymerization reactor so as to remove the water of polycondensation which has formed. During the polymerization of the PAs it is possible to add various additives (heat and UV stabilizers, . plasticizers and the like), catalysts (preferably chosen from phosphorus oxides), chain<br>
limiters generally chosen from mono- and diacids and mono- and diamines, optical brighteners arid the like.<br>
At the (end of the polymerization of the PAs the modified silica according to the invention is obtained which has substantially the same particle size as the starting porous silica.<br>
The second process developed by the Applicant Company can only be used in the case of PAs whose monomers are solid at ambient temperature and are capable of being reduced to powder, for example by milling. This second process consists in dry-blending the monomers in powder form and the porous silica at the ambient temperature and then performing the polymerization of the PA monomers by heating the above mixture to a temperature which is higher than the melting temperature of the said monomers.<br>
At the end of the polymerization the modified silica according to the invention is obtained which has substantially The same particle size as the starting porous silica. !<br>
Another subject-matter of the present invention is various uses of the modified silica described above.<br>
They can be employed as additives to paints to improve their resistance to abrasion, to scratches and to crayoning. In general, they are incorporated in a proportion of 0.5 to 10 % of the total weight of the paint. Like silica powders, the silicas according to the invention impart a matting effect to the paint in which they are incorporated, i.e. their presence allows the gloss of the paint to be appreciably decreased.<br>
They can be incorporated into liquid paints in an organic phase or in aqueous phase or into paints in powder form.<br>
The liquid paints can be applied to the substrates to be coated using known techniques, such as the application with a varnisher directly or in "reverse" by spraying, with the aid of a gun with mixed air or without air, by coating on a belt or coil coating, and the like.<br><br>
The paints in powder form can be applied by various techniques, among which there may be mentioned spraying with the aid of an electrostatic gun and immersion of the substrate to be coated in a fluidized bath. I<br>
The paints can be applied onto substrates of diverse nature (and shape. The substrates most commonly employed are metallic (steel, iron, aluminium, alloys and the like), but it is also possible to coat substrates made 'of wood, glass, paper and of composite, layered or laminated materials.<br>
Before coating with the aid of the paint the<br>
substrate may undergo one or more surface treatments<br><br>
(degreasing, flaming, corona treatment, action of a plasma, and the like) intended to improve the anchoring of the paint; the substrate may be precoated with the aid of an adhesion primer before coating with the paint. <br><br>
The modified silica according to the invention can also be employed as antiblocking agent intended to prevent the adhesive bonding to themselves of films based on (co)polyolefins or olefin blends, which are folded or wound on reels, like the silica powders of the prior art (see, for example, DE 4 424 775) .<br>
The modified silica according to the invention can moreover be employed as carrier for incorporating pigments, dyes, stabilizers, antioxidants and/or anti-i UV agents and other usual additives which are often in the form of very fine and very volatile powders, and this has the effect of very appreciably limiting the volatility of these products when they are being handled and being incorporated in diverse compositions in liauid or solid form.<br>
Finally, it can be used for the preparation of products for cosmetic, such as powders,, eye shadows, lipsticks, foundations, products for cleansing or removing make-up, lotions, care creams, shampoos, and the like.<br>
MANNERS I OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Examples. 1 to_. 7 preparation of _modi_£iGd.__ silica<br>
Exairipl e 1<br>
(@ In a 500-ml pear-shaped Rotavapor  round bottom<br>
flask are placed 30 g of silica of 5 urn mean particle'-size,  of pore volume 1.8 ral/g and of absorptivity, measured according to DIN ISO standard 787/V equal to<br>
320 g of oil/100 g of silica, marketed by Grace under<br>
® the trade name Syloid  ED 5, together with 33 g of<br>
11-aminoundecanoic acid (All).<br>
The flask is placed under a nitrogen purge, immersed in a bath of silicone oil heated to 240°C, and rotated at a speed of the order of 1 rev/min.<br>
After 3 min the temperature in the flask reaches 220°C, that is to say higher than the melting temperature of 11-aminoundecanoic acid, and a release of water is noted, which means that the<br>
polycondensation reaction has already started, i<br>
After 30 min of reaction, when the temperature of the reaction mixture has stabilized at 234°C, the flask is cooled while the purging with nitrogen is maintained and an agglomerate-free powder of mean particle size equal to 5 µm is recovered.<br>
The inherent viscosity of the PA extracted from the modified silica, measured in a solution containing 0.5 % of PA in m-cresol at 25°C, is 0.94.<br>
Example 2<br>
By repeating the operating conditions of Example I and starting from the same starting materials but in modified proportions (30 parts by weight of All and 70 parts of silica), modified silica powder according to the invention is prepared with a PA/silica mass ratio of 30/70.1<br>
Example 3<br>
By repeating the operation conditions of Example 1 and starting from the same starting materials but in modified proportions (10 parts by weight of All and 90 parts of isilica), modified silica powder<br>
1<br><br>
according to the invention is prepared with a PA/silica mass ratio of 10/90.<br>
Examp2.e 4<br>
From the same starting materials as in Example 1 and in similar operating conditions (only the polymerization time is modified and is taken to 1 h) . A powder is obtained with the same particle size as the starting silica powder, agglomerate-free and in which the polyamide, once extracted from the modified silica, has an inherent viscosity of 1.22.<br>
Example 5<br>
In operating conditions similar to those of Example 1 (polymerization temperature: 253°C; polymerization time: 20 min) , a modified silica is prepared from the same silica as that in Example 1, from hexanediamine and from adipic acid in a mass ratio (PA-6,6 monomers)/silica of 50/50. A modified silica powder according to the invention is obtained, with the same particle size as the starting silica powder but which exhibits approximately 15 % by weight of agglomerates.<br>
ExampIe 6<br>
In operating conditions similar to those of Example 1 (polymerization temperature: 230°C; polymerization time: 30 min) a modified silica is prepared from the same silica as that in Example 1 and from 6-aminohexanoic acid in a 6-aminohexanoic acid/silica mass ratio of 50/50. One third of the 6-¬aminohexanoic acid is converted to e-caprolactam and distils during the preparation of the modified silica. A powder of the same particle size as the starting<br>
I<br>
silica powder is ; obtained, but this powder is highly<br>
agglomerated.<br>
i Example 7<br>
In operating conditions which are similar to those in Example 1 an attempt is made to prepare a modified silica from the same silica an that in Example 1 and from dodecalactam in a dodecalactam/silica mass ratio of 50/50. Sublimation of the dodecalactam is<br><br>
noted and a silica powder is obtained from which no PA-12 is extracted.<br>
The experiment is repeated, an organic acid being added to try to trigger the polymerization, but no improvement is observed.<br>
