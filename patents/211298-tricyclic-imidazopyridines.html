and the salts of these compounds.<br>
The compounds according to the Invention can be prepared as described in the examples below in an exemplary manner, or by employing similar process steps using appropriate starting materials (see, for example, WO 98/42707, WO 98/54188, EP-A-299470 or Kaminskl et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28,876-<br>
10<br>
•<br><br>
892 and Angew. Chem. 1996, 108, 589-591). The starting materials are known, or they can be pre¬pared in a manner similar to that for known compounds. The compounds according to the Invention can be prepared, for example, in accordance with the reaction schemes below.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
1. Oxidation<br>
2. Removal of protective groups and cyclization<br>
(acyldn)<br><br>
In the scheme below, the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 according to the invention where R1 = CH3l R2a or R2b and R3a or R3b = hydroxyi and X = O (oxygen) is outlined in an exemplary manner:<br><br>
In scheme 1 above, the enantioselective synthesis of a 7,8-dioI according to the invention (R2a or R2b and R3a or R3b are In each case hydroxyi) is shown in an exemplary manner; if desired, the diol can subsequently be etherified In a suitable manner.<br>
Group Y in compound 3 above is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, preferably chlorine. The acylation Is carried out in a manner familiar to the person skilled in the art, preferably using sodium bis(trimethylsllyl)am!de or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amlde, if the leaving group is a chlorine atom.<br>
The oxidation that follows after the acylation Is likewise carried out under customary conditions using the oxidizing agent chloranil, atmospheric oxygen or manganese dioxide. For the subsequent removal<br><br>
of protective groups and cyclization, certain conditions have to be met with respect to the auxiliary acid used. Advantageously, the auxiliary acid used according to the invention is formic acid.<br>
The reduction to the diol Is likewise carried out under standard conditions (see, for example, WO 98/54188), where the reducing agent used is, for example, sodium borohydride, the use of which al¬lows the given 7,8-trans-diol to be obtained in a diastereomeric purity of more than 90%. Etherification, which is carried out subsequently, if desired, and which is likewise carried out in a usual manner, gives the compounds of the formula 1* according to the invention in which R2a and R3b are hydrogen.<br>
To prepare compounds of the formula 1 in which R3a and R3b are hydrogen, 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid derivatives (which are appropriately protected at the hydroxyl group), in which Y (analogously to the scheme above) is a suitable leaving group, have to be used as starting materials in place of compound 3.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
In the scheme below, the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 according to the invention where R1 = CH3, R2a or R2b = hydroxyl and X = NH is outlined in an exemplary manner using compounds of the formula 2 (see scheme 1) as starting materials:<br><br><br><br>
1. Cyclization<br>
2. Oxidation<br><br>
G^NH<br><br><br>
(acyloln)<br><br>
Reduction<br><br>
Scheme 2 above also represents, in an exemplary manner, an enantioselectlve synthesis. Y again<br>
12<br><br>
denotes a suitable leaving group, for example a methoxy group. Depending on whether a compound where R3a and R3b = hydrogen or a compound where R3a or R3b = hydroxyl is desired, the group G denotes either hydrogen or a hydroxyl group (which is, for example, protected by a suitable silyl radi¬cal).<br>
Reduction of the keto group with sodium borohydride, which follows after the cyclization, gives - if G is a hydroxyl group - the 7,8-trans-diol in a diastereomeric purity of more than 90%. Subsequent etherifi-cation, which is carried out by known processes, gives the end products of the formula 1* in which R2a and R3b are hydrogen. The corresponding 7,8-cis compound is obtained by chromatographic purifica¬tion from the mother liquor which remains after the 7,8-trans compound has been separated off.<br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, for ex¬ample by distilling off the solvent under reduced pressure and recrystallizing the resulting residue from a suitable solvent, or by subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for exam¬ple, column chromatography on a suitable stationary phase.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent, for example in a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or in a low-molecular-weight aliphatic alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or to which the desired acid is subsequently added. The salts are obtained by filtration, reprecipltation, precipitation with a nonsolvent for the addi¬tion salt or by evaporating the solvent. The resulting salts can be converted by alkalization or acidifica¬tion into the free compounds which in turn can be used to prepare salts. In this manner, it is possible to convert pharmacologically unacceptable salts into pharmacologically acceptable salts.<br>
The pure enantiomers, in particular the pure enantiomers of the formula 1*, which are preferably pro¬vided by the invention, can be obtained in a manner familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example by enantioselectlve synthesis (se$, for example, the scheme), by chromatographic separation on chirai separation columns, by derivatization with chirai auxiliaries, subsequent separation of the diastereomers and removal of the chirai auxiliary group, by salt formation with chirai acids, subsequent separation of the salts and liberation of. the desired compound from the salt, or by (fractional) crystalli¬zation from a suitable solvent.<br>
The resulting etherified trans products (for example compounds 1* where R2a and R3b = hydrogen) can - at least partially - be converted into the corresponding cis products (for example where R2b and R3b a hydrogen) by allowing the product to stand under acidic conditions (for example in 2 equivalents of acid, such as sulfuric acid) in the corresponding alcohol R2a-OH. Likewise, cis products can be con¬verted into the corresponding trans products. The cis and trans products are separated, for example, by chromatography or by crystallization.<br>
13<br><br>
The starting materials of the formula 2 can be prepared from compounds known from the literature or by working analogously to processes known from the literature (for example Kaminski et al., J. Med, Chem. 1985,28,876-892), for example according to the general scheme 3 below.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
In the scheme below, the preparation of the starting compounds 2 where R4 = -COOC2Hs or R4 = -CH2OCH3 is outlined in an exemplary manner.<br><br><br>
The conversion into compound 4 is carried out in a manner known to the person skilled in the art. Con¬version of 4 into 5 can be carried out by different routes, for example using the Heck reaction (with Pd(II), carbon monoxide and ethanol) or by metaliation in the 6-position (with lithium or magnesium) and subsequent Grignard reaction. By metaliation, it Is also possible to introduce other desired groups R4 into position 6, for example fluorine, chlorine or the carboxyl group. Starting with the ester group, it is possible to introduce further desired groups R4 into position 6, for example hydroxy-1-4C-alkyl radi¬cals (in particular the hydroxymethyl radical) by reducing the ester radical with lithium aluminum hydride, or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular 1-4C-alkoxymethyl radicals) by subsequent ethertfication as outlined in Scheme 3.<br>
Debenzylation/reduction of the compounds 5 and 6 is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example by using hydrogen/Pd(0). If the desired compounds are compounds where R4 = -CO-NR5R6, a corresponding derivatization can be carried out in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester into an amide) at the stage of compound 5 or after debenzylation/reduction, or alternatively at the stage of the acyioin (see Schemes 1 and 2).<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in more detail, without limiting it. Further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can likewise be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner known per se to the person skilled in the art, using customary process tech¬niques. The abbreviation mln stands for minute(s), h stands for hour(s) and ee stands for enantiomeric excess. In some successive examples the preparation of pairs of diastereoisomers is described. In case of the pairs 7R,8R,9R / 7S,8R,9R, the diastereoisomers can be separated by column chroma¬tography with the 7S,8R,9R diastereoisomer being contained in the first and the 7R,8R,9R diastereoi-somer being contained in the second main fraction.<br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans. In this connection, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of signifi¬cant side effects and a large therapeutic range.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal Inflammatory diseases and le¬sions, and of gastric acid-related diseases in mammals including man (such as, for example, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, gastritis, hyperacids or medicament-related functional gastropathy, reflux esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, heartburn), which can be caused, for example, by microor¬ganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmacologically acceptable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disor¬ders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
A further subject of the Invention are therefore the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention likewise includes the use of the compounds according to the Invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore Includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treat¬ment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
A further subject of the invention are medicaments which comprise one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically acceptable salts.<br>
22<br><br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharma¬ceutical auxiliaries or excipients in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible to obtain a pharmaceutical administration form ex¬actly adapted to the active compound and/or to the desired onset and/or duration of action of action (e.g. a sustained-release form or an enteric form) by means of the appropriate selection of the auxilia¬ries and excipients.<br>
The auxiliaries and excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations are known to the person skilled In the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound excipients, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulslflers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or, in particular, permeation promoters and complexing agents (e.g. cyclodextrlns).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound(s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of several, preferably 1 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of a parenteral treatment, similar or (in par¬ticular in the case of the intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. The establishment of the optimal dose and manner of administration of the active com¬pounds necessary in each case can easily be carried out by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be used for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmaco¬logically active constituents of other groups of medicaments, for example: tranquillizers (for example from the group of the benzodiazepines, for example diazepam), spasmolytics (for example, bie-tamiverine or camylofine), anticholinergics (for example, oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics, (for example, tetracaine or procaine), and, If appropriate, also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
To be emphasized in this connection is in particular the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H7K* ATPase Inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or further with so-<br>
23<br><br>
called peripheral anticholinergics (e.g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the principal action in an additive or super-additive sense and/or of eliminating or of decreasing the side effects, or further the combination with antibacterially active substances (such as, for example, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nltroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts) for the control of Helicobacter pylori. Suitable antibacterial co-components which may be mentioned are, for example, mezlocillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamycin, amikacin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, azithro¬mycin and combinations thereof (for example clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br>
24<br><br>

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rat, female, 200-250 g; 1.5g/kg i.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and another via the pylorus such that the ends of the tube just projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outward Into the right abdominal wall through a side opening.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), warm (37°C) physiological NaCI solution was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita 1). The pH (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA 147;  = 5 mm, Metrohm) and, by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Doslmat 665 Metrohm), the secreted KCI were determined In the effluent In each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1 jig/kg (= 1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (I.e. after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intravenously In a 1 ml/kg liquid volume 60 min after the start of the continuous pentagastrin infusion.<br>
25<br><br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of a rectal temperature sensor).<br>
