COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following  specification  particularly describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention is concerned with rinse-off hair-conditioning compositions which are applied to the hair and then substantially rinsed away.  It is particularly concerned with hair shampoo compositions, which both clean the hair and provide conditioning benefit to the hair. More specifically, it is concerned with improving the deposition of silicone conditioning oil onto the tip region of hair relative to the root region, from shampoo compositions which contain dispersed hydrophobic conditioning oil droplets and which are substantially free of cationic deposition polymers.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Compositions which provide a combination of cleansing and conditioning to the hair are well know in the art.  Such shampoo or shower-gel compositions typically comprise one or more surfactants for shampooing or cleansing purposes and one or more conditioning agents.  The purpose of the conditioning agent is to make the hair easier to comb when wet and more manageable when dry, e.g. less static and fly-away.  Typically, these conditioning agents are water-insoluble oily materials, cationic polymers or cationic surfactants.<br>
Amongst the most popular conditioning agents used in shampoo products are oily materials such as mineral oils, naturally occurring oils such as triglycerides and silicone polymers. These are generally present in the shampoo as dispersed<br><br>
hydrophobic emulsion droplets.  Conditioning is achieved by the oily material being deposited onto the hair resulting in the formation of a film.<br>
Conditioning compositions which provide conditioning only, without cleansing surfactants, are also well known in the art. Such compositions are generally applied to the hair after the cleansing composition has been rinsed away.<br>
One method to improve deposition of conditioning oils onto hair is to use large droplets of oil.  This method relies on physical contact between the hair and the droplets followed by the oil droplet wetting the hair surface and spreading.<br>
Natural oils secreted by the sebaceous gland at the base of the hair lead to hair being more hydrophobic near the root rather than near the tip.  This means that droplets deposited onto hair by the use of large droplets of oil are more likely to spread and form films on the hair at the base of.the hair rather than near the tip of the hair, and this is found in practice.<br>
Another method to enhance deposition of the conditioning oil droplets onto the hair is to employ a cationic deposition polymer in the composition.  The use of such polymers is well known in the prior art.<br>
The use of cationic polymers means that the oil droplets are flocculated with the cationic polymer on dilution of the shampoo when the hair is rinsed.  This leads to indiscriminate deposition of the cationic polymer, conditioning oil and any<br><br><br>
other insoluble materials onto the hair. The presence of extraneous materials in addition to the conditioning oil can lead to dulling of the appearance of the hair (loss of shine) and also to a heavy feel to the hair (because of the presence of the cationic polymer).<br>
Certain consumers find the effects arising from the two deposition methods described above to be undesirable in that they lead to the hair feeling greasy at the roots or heavy and dull.<br>
US 3753916 discloses the use of cationic polymers as deposition aids for conditioning oils. Poloxamers are mentioned under the trade name Pluronic as optional ingredients.<br>
WO 92/14440 discloses Pluronics (Poloxamers) in anti-dandruff shampoos as one of a class of 'synergisers' that unexpectedly enhance anti-dandruff efficacy.<br>
WO 96/17590 discloses personal washing compositions containing lipids as the conditioning phase.  The lipids are emulsified with a nonionic emulsifier.  Poloxamers are listed as one of the possible polyalkoxy nonionic emulsifiers with HLB (hydrophile lipophile balance) in the range 1 to 15.<br>
US 5100657 lists Pluronics (Poloxamers) as optional ingredients in hair conditioner compositions.<br>
In attempts to overcome the problems in the prior art, it has been considered desirable to target the deposition of the conditioning oil droplets onto the tip regions of the hair in<br><br>
preference to the root regions, and much research has been carried out in this field of work.  Although it would be desirable to make the surface of the oil droplets more hydrophilic, it had always been considered that the high levels of surfactant in shampoo compositions would dominate the surface chemistry and hydrophilicity of the oil droplets.  Thus the conventional view is that irrespective of any additives added to the conditioning oil droplets, the shampoo surfactant would control the droplet hydrophilicity and deposition.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, that by blending certain \\ types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular weight with silicone conditioning oil emulsion droplets, enhanced deposition of the droplets onto the tip regions of hairs can be achieved.  Although not wishing to be bound by the scientific reasoning underlying this phenomenon, it seems that surface active polymer remains at the droplet surface, even in the presence of other surfactant molecules from the shampoo, making the droplets more hydrophilic than the droplets in conventional oil droplet-containing shampoos.  This leads to improved deposition of the droplets towards the more hydrophilic tip region of the hair.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In a first aspect the invention provides an aqueous hair conditioning composition comprising:<br>
a)	from 1% to 50% by weight of a cleansing surfactant,<br>

                                                                                                                 I                                                          I<br>
CH3                                                         CH3<br>
wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is 6 or more.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Compositions in accordance with the invention are formulated as compositions for the cleansing of hair and subsequent rinsing such as shampoos, cleansing mousses or shower gels. It is<br><br>
highly preferred that cleansing compositions according to the invention should contain less than 0.01% by weight of any cationic deposition polymer.<br>
Surface Active Polymer<br>
An essential component of compositions according to the invention is a surface active block copolymer.  This is a block copolymer based on polyethyleneoxide (EO) and polypropyleneoxide (PO) blocks.  The molecular weight of the block copolymer is suitably 4000 unified atomic mass units or more, preferably 7000 or more, more preferably 10000 or more, most preferably 12000 or more.<br>
The mean molecular weight is suitably measured by determining the hydroxyl number for the polymer then transforming this into molecular weight.  This corresponds to a number based mean molecular weight.<br>
Each block of EO or PO polymer in the surface active block copolymer molecule suitably consists of 2 or more of the respective monomer units, preferably of 4 or more, more preferably of 8 or more, even more preferably of 25 of more and most preferably of 40 or more monomer units.<br>
The surface active block copolymer molecule suitable comprises a mean number of 25 or more propylene oxide monomer units, preferably 35 or more, more preferably 45 or more and most preferably 60 or more.<br><br>
Suitable EO/PO block copolymers according to formula I have the CTFA designation Poloxamer.  These are commercially available under the trade name "Pluronic" from BASF.<br>
I    HO ICH2CH20) x (CHCH20) y (CH2CH20) X H<br>
I CH3<br>
Suitably, the mean value of x in formula I is 4 or more, preferably 8 or more, more preferably 25 or more, yet more preferably 50 or more and most preferably 80 or more. Suitably, the mean value of y is 25 or more, preferably 35 or more, more preferably 45 or more and most preferably 60 or more.<br>
Suitable EO/PO block copolymers according to formula II have the CFTA designation poloxamine and are commercially available under the trade name "Tetronic" from BASF.<br>
II(HO(CH2CH20)a(CHCH20)b)2-N-CH2-CH2-N-((OCH2CH)b(OCHCH2)aOH)2<br>
!	I<br>
CH3	CH3<br>
Suitably, the mean value of a is 2 or more, preferably 4 or more, more preferably 8 or more, even more preferably 25 or more and most preferably 40 or more.  The mean value of b is suitably 6 or more, preferably 9 or more, more preferably 11 or more and most preferably 15 or more.<br>
In formula I, the degree of polymerisation, x, is indicated as the same for each polyethyleneoxide block.  This is also the case in formula II for a and b for the EO and PO blocks respectively.  For the sake of clarity, it should be explained<br><br>
that these degrees of polymerisation are mean values and are approximately the same rather than identical for any particular formula.  This is a result of the polymerisation methods used for production of the compounds and known to those skilled in the art of polymer synthesis.<br>
Suitably, the level of surface active block copolymer is from 0.01% to 0.4% by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.02% to 0.3%, more preferably from 0.04% to 0.2%, even more preferably from 0.05% to 0.15%.<br>
Silicone Conditioning Oil<br>
An essential component of compositions according to the invention is hydrophobic silicone conditioning oil. In order for such an oil to exist in discrete droplets in the compositions according to the invention, it must be water-insoluble.  By water-insoluble is meant that the solubility in water at 25°C is 0.01% by weight or less.<br>
It is essential that the D3,2  average particle diameter of the<br>
hydrophobic conditioning oil droplets in the composition is 2 micrometres or more, preferably 5 micrometres or more, and more preferably 8 micrometres or more.  The average particle size of the oil droplets in the composition is 100 micrometres or less to prevent problems in stabilising the composition from separation of components.<br><br><br>
Silicone D3,2 mean droplet  diameter may be measured by means  of<br>
a laser light  scattering technique,   for example using a 2600D Particle Sizer from Malvern Instruments.<br>
The total  amount of  silicone conditioning oil present  in the composition  is preferably from 0.01%  to 10  % by weight of  the total  composition more preferably from 0.3% to 5%,   most preferably 0.5%  to 3  %.<br>
Suitable  silicones  for use as conditioning oils  include polydiorganosiloxanes,   in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone.     Also suitable  for use compositions of the invention are polydimethyl  siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups,   which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol.<br>
It is preferred if the silicone oil  also comprises a functionalised silicone.     Suitable  functionalised silicones include,   for example,   amino-,   carboxy-,   betaine-,   quaternary ammonium-,   carbohydrate-,   hydroxy-  and alkoxy-substituted silicones.   Preferably,   the functionalised silicone contains multiple  substitutions.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt,   as regards hydroxyl-substituted silicones,   a polydimethylsiloxane merely having hydroxyl  end groups   (which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol)   is not considered a  functionalised silicone within the present invention.     However,   a polydimethylsiloxane having hydroxyl substitutions  along the polymer chain is  considered a functionalised silicone.<br><br>
Preferred functionalised silicones are amino-functionalised silicones.  Suitable amino functionalised silicones are described in EP 455,185 (Helene Curtis) and include trimethylsilylamodimethicone as depicted below, and are sufficiently water insoluble so as to be useful in compositions of the invention:<br>
Si(CH3)3 - 0 - [Si(CH3)2 - 0 - ]x - [Si (CH3) (R - NH - CH2CH2 NH2) - 0 -]y - Si (CH3)3<br>
wherein x + y is a number from about 50 to about 500, and the weight percent amine functionality is from about 0.03% to about 8%, and wherein R is an alkylene group having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms.  Preferably, the number x + y is in the from 100 to 300, and the weight percent amine functionality is from about 0.03% to 8%.<br>
As expressed here, the weight percent amine functionality is measured by titrating a sample of the amino-functionalised silicone against alcoholic hydrochloric acid to the bromocresol green end point.  The weight percent amine is calculated using<br>
a molecular weight of 45 (corresponding to CH3- CH2-NH2) <br>
Suitably, the weight percent amine functionality measured and calculated in this way is from 0.03% to 8%, preferably from 0.5% to 4%.<br>
An example of a commercially available amino-functionalised silicone useful in the silicone component of the composition of the invention is DC-8566 available from Dow Corning (INCI name:<br><br>
dimethyl,methyl (aminoethylaminoisobutyl) siloxane) .  This has a weight percent amine functionality of about 1.4%.<br>
By "amino functional silicone" is meant a silicone containing at least one primary, secondary or tertiary amine group, or a quaternary ammonium group.  Examples of suitable amino functional silicones include: polysiloxanes having the CTFA designation "amodimethicone".  Specific examples of amino functional silicones suitable for use in the invention are the aminosilicone oils DC-8220, DC-8166, DC-8466, and DC-8950-114 (all ex Dow Corning), and GE 1149-75, (ex General Electric Silicones).  Suitable quaternary silicone polymers are described in EP-A-0 530 974. A preferred quaternary silicone polymer is K3474, ex Goldschmidt.<br>
Another preferred functional silicone for use as a component in the hydrophobic conditioning oil is an alkoxy-substituted silicone.  Such molecules are known as silicone copolyols and have one or more polyethyleneoxide or polypropyleneoxide groups bonded to the silicone polymer backbone, optionally through an alkyl linking group.<br>
A non-limiting example of a type of silicone copolyol useful in compositions of the invention has a molecular structure according to the formula depicted below:<br>
Si(CH3)3 [0-Si(CH3) (A)]p - tO-Si (CH3)(B)]g - 0 - Si (CH3)3<br>
In this formula, A is an alkylene chain with from 1 to 22 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 18, more preferably 10 to 16. B<br><br>
is a group with the structure: -(R)—(E0)r4-(P0) B-OH wherein R-is a<br>
linking group, preferably an alkylene group with 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms. Preferably R is -(CH2)2--  The mean values of r and s are<br>
5 or more, preferably 10 or more, more preferably 15 or more. It is preferred if the mean values of r and s are 100 or less. In the formula, the value of p is suitably 10 or more, preferably 20 or more, more preferably 50 or more and most preferably 100 or more.  The value of q is suitably from 1 to 20 wherein the ratio p/q is preferably 10 or more, more preferably 20 or more.  The value of p + q is a number from 11 to 500, preferably from 50 to 300.<br>
Suitable silicone copolyols have an HLB of 10 or less, preferably 7 or less, more preferably 4 or less. A suitable silicone copolyol material is DC5200, known as Lauryl PEG/PPG -18/18 methicone (INCI name), available from Dow Corning.<br>
Hydrophile/Lipophile balance or HLB is a well known parameter used by those skilled in the art to characterise surface active molecules and emulsifiers.<br>
Suitable methods for the experimental determination of HLB are in Griffin W.C, Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, volume l page 311 (1949).  The commercially available silicone copolyols are supplied along with a value of their HLB by Dow Corning.<br>
It is preferred to use a combination of functional and non¬functional silicones as the conditioning oil.  Preferably these<br><br>
are blended into common droplets prior to incorporation into compositions according to the invention.<br>
The viscosity of the silicone oil blend measured in isolation from the rest of the composition (i.e. not the viscosity of any pre-formed emulsion, but of the silicone blend forming the hydrophobic conditioning oil) is suitably from 1,000 to<br>
2,000,000 mm sec" at 25  C, preferably from 5,000 to 1,000,000,<br>
more preferably from 10,000 to 500,000, most preferably from 50,000 to 300,000.  Suitable methods for measuring the kinematic viscosity of silicone oils are known to those skilled in the art, e.g. capillary viscometers.<br>
For high viscosity silicones, a constant stress rheometer can be used to measure viscosity.<br>
Cationic Deposition Polymer<br>
A cationic deposition polymer is often used in hair treatment compositions, for enhancing conditioning performance.  However this leads to problems arising from the cationic polymer also remaining adhered to the hair, which can, in some cases, lead to a dirty, sticky feel to the hair some hours after use of the cleansing and conditioning composition for some consumers.<br>
Such cationic polymers may be a homopolymer or be formed from two or more types of monomers.  The molecular weight of the polymer will generally be between 5 000 and 10 000 000 unified atomic mass units, typically at least 10 000 and preferably from 100 000 to 2 000 000.  The polymers will have cationic nitrogen<br><br><br>
containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated amino groups, or a mixture thereof.<br>
It is highly preferred that compositions according to the invention should contain less than 0.04% by weight of such a cationic deposition polymer, more preferably less than 0.02%, even more preferably less than 0.01%.  It is most preferred that such polymers are absent from the composition.<br>
Preparation of Compositions<br>
One method for preparing compositions according to the invention is to add a silicone conditioning oil, along with the other components comprising the hair treatment composition, followed by suitable mixing of the composition in order to ensure that the blend is dispersed as droplets of a suitable size.<br>
However it is preferred if the hydrophobic silicone conditioning oil is first formed into an aqueous emulsion prior to incorporation into the hair treatment composition. Thus another aspect of the invention is a method for preparing an aqueous hair conditioning composition comprising the steps of :<br>
i) preparing a solution comprising water and the surface active block copolymer,<br>
ii) adding a silicone conditioning oil to the solution,<br>
iii) forming the solution and the silicone conditioning oil into an oil-in-water emulsion by high-shear mixing,<br><br><br>
iv) dispersing the oil-in-water emulsion comprising the block copolymer into a hair conditioning composition.<br>
Another preferred method for preparing a hair conditioning composition according to the invention comprises the steps of:<br>
i) preparing an oil-in-water emulsion of a silicone conditioning oil,<br>
ii) dispersing the surface active block copolymer into the emulsion,<br>
iii) dispersing the oil-in-water emulsion comprising the block copolymer into a hair conditioning composition.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers for use in the preparation of the aqueous emulsion are well known in the art and include anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.  Examples of anionic surfactants used as emulsifiers for the silicone particles are<br>
alkylarylsulphonates, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, alkyl ether sulphates, e.g., sodium lauryl ether sulphate nEO, where n is from 1 to 20, alkylphenol ether sulphates, e.g., octylphenol ether sulphate nEO where n is from 1 to 20, and sulphosuccinates, e.g., sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate.<br>
Examples of nonionic surfactants suitable for use as emulsifiers for the silicone droplets are alkylphenol ethoxylates, e.g., nonylphenol ethoxylate nEO, where n is from<br><br>
1 to 50 and alcohol ethoxylates, e.g., lauryl alcohol nEO, where n is from 1 to 50, ester ethoxylates, e.g., polyoxyethylene monostearate where the number of oxyethylene units is from 1 to 30.<br>
A preferred process for preparing oil-in-water emulsions of the mixed silicone droplets which can then be incorporated in the hair treatment compositions involves use of a mixer.<br>
Depending upon the viscosities of components of the silicone mixture a suitable mixer should be chosen so as to provide sufficient shear to give the required final particle size of the emulsion.  Examples of suitable benchtop mixers spanning the range of necessary shear are Heidolph RZR2100, Silverson L4R and Ystral X10/20-750.  Other mixers of similar specification are well known to those skilled in the art and can also be used in this application.  Equally it is possible to manufacture oil-in-water emulsions of this description on larger scale mixers which offer similar shear regimes to those described above.<br>
Preferably, the mixer is also capable of having the temperature of mixing controlled, e.g. it comprises a jacket through which a heat transfer fluid can be circulated.<br>
It is preferred if the aqueous phase of the emulsion contains a polymeric thickening agent to prevent phase separation of the emulsion after preparation.  Preferred thickening agents are cross-linked polyacrylates, cellulosic polymers or derivatives of cellulosic polymers.<br><br><br>
Cleansing Surfactant<br>
Compositions according to the invention will comprise one or more cleansing surfactants which are cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair.  Further surfactants may be present as an additional ingredient if sufficient for cleansing purposes is not provided by the emulsifier for the water-insoluble oily component.  It is preferred that shampoo compositions of the invention comprise at least one further surfactant (in addition to any used as emulsifying agent for the silicone component) to provide a cleansing benefit.<br>
Suitable cleansing surfactants, which may be used singularly or in combination, are selected from anionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.  The cleansing surfactant may be the same surfactant as the emulsifier, or may be different.<br>
The total amount of surfactant (including any co-surfactant, and/or any emulsifier) in compositions of the invention is generally from 1 to 50, preferably from 2 to 40, more preferably from 10 to 25 percent by weight of the composition.<br>
Anionic Cleansing Surfactant<br>

The invention is further demonstrated with reference to the following, non-limiting examples:<br>
Examples<br>
Examples 1 to 9 are examples according to the invention. Examples A to C are comparative examples.<br><br>

Compositions in table 1 were prepared as described above by forming an aqueous emulsion of the DC200 using a suitable nonionic emulsifier and the block copolymer (when present as indicated in the table).  The subsequent emulsion was then blended with the other ingredients except salt. The salt was finally added to thicken the composition.<br>
Test Method<br>
0.25g/5 cm switches of tip hair which had been cleaned with a solution of 14% SLES 2E0 and 2% cocoamidopropyl betaine in water followed by extensive rinsing,  were used for this experiment. The test shampoo was diluted to 1 in 10 by weight with distilled water and stirred throughout with a magnetic stirrer.  5 switches were placed in one half of a petri dish. 1.5 mis of diluted<br><br><br>
shampoo was placed along the length of the switches which were then agitated in the dish for 30 seconds, followed by a rinse for 30 seconds under tap water (12° French hard) at 40°C, with a flow rate set at 3-4 litres per minute.  The washing process using the test shampoo solution was repeated followed again by rinsing. The switches were then allowed to dry naturally at 25° C and a relative humidity of 45 to 60%.<br>
The same sequence of experimentation was carried out for 0.25g/5 cm samples of root hair.<br>
The amount of silicone deposited on the hair samples was measured using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (measured in parts per million (ppm) of silicon).<br>
Analysis results<br>
The absolute selectivity expressed as a percentage is the ratio of silicon ppm on the tip samples to silicon ppm on the root samples multiplied by 100.<br>
The absolute selectivity calculated for Example A (without block copolymer) was then subtracted from the absolute selectivity calculated for each of the other Example formulations to derive a targeting score.  The results are shown below in Table 2.  A targeting score of 5% or less is considered to be of no significant value.<br><br>
