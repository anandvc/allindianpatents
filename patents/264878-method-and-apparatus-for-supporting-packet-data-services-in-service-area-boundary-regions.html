				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to providing packet data service to mobile<br>
stations, and particularly relates to providing packet data service in the boundary regions<br>
of wireless communication network service areas.<br>
In the context of wireless communication networks, one might fairly view some of<br>
the developing changes as evolutionary, and some of them as revolutionary. Evolutionary<br>
changes typically build on pre-existing capabilities and protocols, and usually include<br>
provisions to ensure backward compatibility. On the other hand, revolutionary changes<br>
typically represent a departure from prior practices, and are oftentimes incompatible with<br>
the existing standards. These disadvantages usually are offset by performance or<br>
efficiency improvements that simply cannot be achieved while preserving backwards<br>
compatibility.<br>
Generally, cdma2000 networks include a mix of evolutionary and revolutionary<br>
technologies. For example, the older IS-95B networks standard provided low-rate<br>
dedicated channels on the forward link supporting circuit-switched voice and data<br>
services. For backwards compatibility, cdma2000 network standards preserved these low-<br>
rate forward link channels, referred to as Forward Fundamental Channels (F-FCHs).<br>
However, these low rate channels may be used for circuit-switched and packet-switched<br>
services in cdma2000 networks, albeit limited to typical data rates of 9.6 Kbps.<br>
In a revolutionary break from the pre-existing IS-95B channel definitions,<br>
cdma2000 standards defined a new type of dedicated forward link channel, the Forward<br>
Supplemental Channel (F-SCH). One or more F-SCHs can be assigned as needed to<br>
individual mobile stations to support higher-rate packet data services. F-SCHs can support<br>
packet data rates greater than 500 kbps, and have the further advantage of being supported<br>
in soft handoff. That is, packet data traffic for F-SCH service to a given mobile station<br>
can be sent from the mobile station's source Base Station (BS) to one or more neighboring<br>
BSs over the sidehaul links used to communicatively link BSs. The controlling<br>
Interoperability Standards (IOSs) define these sidehaul links as the A3/A7 interfaces.<br>
2<br><br>
Assuming that a source base station has established a F-SCH with a given mobile<br>
station, the F-SCH can be transferred in soft handoff to a neighboring, target base station<br>
responsive to the mobile station moving into (or through) a boundary region between the<br>
source and target base stations' service areas. To accomplish this, the source base station<br>
requests that the target base station setup a F-SCH for the mobile station and, assuming<br>
that the request is successful, the source base station begins sending packet data traffic for<br>
the mobile station over the A3/A7 sidehaul links for transmission by the target base station<br>
on the newly assigned F-SCH.<br>
Since the source base station at least temporarily continues transmitting that packet<br>
data on its own F-SCH, the mobile station is served from both the source and target base<br>
stations. Of course, if the mobile station moves back toward the source base station, the<br>
target base station may tear down its F-SCH. Conversely, if the mobile station moves<br>
further away from the source base station, the source base station may tear down its F-<br>
SCH, although it continues sending packet data for the mobile station out over the sidehaul<br>
links as needed.<br>
As much as F-SCHs have improved achievable packet data service rates in<br>
cdma2000 networks, they are not without their drawbacks. For example, F-SCHs are not<br>
necessarily efficient in terms of the network resources they utilize. For example, higher F-<br>
SCH data rates requires more CDMA spreading code resources—thereby reducing the<br>
codes available for other users—and requires potentially significant forward link transmit<br>
power—thereby reducing the power available for other users. Newer revisions of the<br>
cdma2000 standards address the need for providing efficient higher-rate packet data<br>
services by way of defining a new forward link packet data channel type, namely the<br>
Forward Packet Data Channel (F-PDCH).<br>
By assigning multiple users to the F-PDCH in a time-sharing arrangement<br>
according to a dynamically maintained transmission schedule, one F-PDCH can support<br>
high-rate packet data services to a relatively large number of users. That feature obviates<br>
the need for allocating dedicated F-SCHs to each user desiring high-rate packet data<br>
3<br><br>
services. Further, the F-PDCH is transmitted as a rate-controlled channel rather than<br>
as a power-controlled channel—F-SCHs in contrast are power-controlled channels.<br>
More particularly, the F-PDCH is transmitted using whatever "leftover" transmit<br>
power is available at the RBS after allocating power to the dedicated channels, the<br>
broadcast and control channels, and the pilot channel(s). To serve each mobile station at<br>
the highest rate supportable given the available F-PDCH transmit power the particular<br>
reception conditions prevailing at the mobile station, each mobile station returns Channel<br>
Quality Indicator (CQI) reports at a high rate (e.g., 800 Hz). The RBS then sets the<br>
individual data rates for transmitting to the individual mobile stations on the F-PDCH<br>
based on receiving these CQI reports.<br>
The upshot of this sophistication is that the F-PDCH offers the two-fold advantage<br>
of providing typically higher packet data service rates to mobile stations as compared to<br>
the rates achievable with dedicated F-SCHs, and offers more efficient utilization of<br>
network resources as compared to the use of dedicated F-SCHs. In at least some contexts,<br>
however, the F-PDCH suffers from one or more disadvantages.<br>
First, the existing IOSs do not provide for soft handoff of the F-PDCH between<br>
different base stations—note the F-PDCH can be handed off between different RBSs<br>
operating under control of the same Base Station Controller, assuming the involved RBSs<br>
each support the F-PDCH. Second, in a given network, not every RBS will be configured<br>
to support the F-PDCH, thus giving rise to different service areas having mixed<br>
capabilities. That is, two adjacent service areas may both support F-SCH packet data<br>
service, but only one of them supports F-PDCH packet data service.<br>
In the first instance, packet data service on the F-PDCH cannot be continued across<br>
the boundary region between source and target base station service areas because the<br>
source base station has no defined mechanism for sharing the packet data traffic across its<br>
A3/A7 sidehaul links with the target base station. In the second instance, packet data<br>
service on the F-PDCH cannot be continued across the boundary region between source<br>
and target base station service areas simply because the target base station does not<br>
4<br><br>
support the F-PDCH. In both instances, the problem of continuing high-rate packet<br>
data services to a mobile station moving in, or through, a boundary region is left<br>
unaddressed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus supporting packet data<br>
service to mobile stations by switching between shared and dedicated packet data channels<br>
to continue packet data service in and across base station service boundaries and shared<br>
packet data channel service boundaries. According to the present invention, a given<br>
mobile station may be switched from a shared packet data channel to a dedicated packet<br>
data channel as it moves into the boundary region of a first service area having adjacent<br>
service areas not supporting handoff of the shared packet data channel, or not offering<br>
shared packet data channel service. For example, the switchover between channel types<br>
can be made responsive to determining whether the first or adjacent service areas offer<br>
better received signal quality to the mobile station, determining whether network resources<br>
are better utilized by providing shared or dedicated channel service, and/or determining<br>
that the shared or dedicated channel service offers better quality of service to the mobile<br>
station.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention thus comprises a method of providing<br>
packet data service to a mobile station based on serving the mobile station in a first service<br>
area of a wireless communication network using a shared packet data channel, and<br>
switching packet data traffic for the mobile station from the shared packet data channel to<br>
a dedicated packet data channel responsive to detecting that the mobile station is in a<br>
boundary region of the first service area. The boundary region may be associated with<br>
adjacent service areas controlled by other base stations that do not support the shared<br>
packet data channel at all, or that are not configured to support shared packet data channel<br>
handoffs.<br>
In determining whether (and when) to switch packet data traffic for the mobile<br>
station from a shared packet data channel to a dedicated packet data channel, or vice versa,<br>
5<br><br>
a source base station may evaluate radio link signal qualities for itself and one or<br>
more neighboring base stations associated with the boundary region. For example, the<br>
source base station may monitor signal quality reports from the mobile station, and<br>
switchover from a shared channel to a dedicated channel responsive to detecting that the<br>
mobile station is in a boundary region. However, because data rates typically are higher<br>
on the shared channel, at least until the radio link quality between the source base station<br>
and the mobile station that support the shared channel deteriorates, the source base station<br>
may be configured to continue packet data service for as long as practicable as the mobile<br>
station moves through the boundary region.<br>
For an exemplary cdma2000-based embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
shared packet data channel comprises a Forward Packet Data Channel (F-PDCH) that is<br>
used to carry high-rate packet data traffic for a plurality of mobile stations (users)<br>
according to time-multiplexed transmissions of individual user data on a CDMA carrier<br>
signal. In this same context, the dedicated packet data channel comprises a Forward<br>
Supplemental Channel (F-SCH). F-SCHs are assigned to individual mobile stations as<br>
needed to support higher packet data rates than can be supported with dedicated Forward<br>
Fundamental Channels (F-FCHs). In general, the network resource utilization of F-SCHs<br>
is less efficient than the F-PDCH for high-rate packet data services, so F-PDCH service, if<br>
available, is preferred.<br>
By operation of the present invention, a base station controller—e.g., a cdma2000<br>
base station controller (BSC)—can include one or more processing circuits configured to<br>
switch the packet data traffic for a given mobile station from a shared packet data channel<br>
to a dedicated packet data channel, or vice versa, in accordance with the present<br>
invention's exemplary methods. For example, a source BSC can establish packet data<br>
service for a given mobile station on a F-PDCH transmitted by a Radio Base Station<br>
(RBS) that is controlled by the source BSC. Packet data service on the F-PDCH can be<br>
continued for intra-BSC handoffs between the RBSs controlled by the source BSC that<br>
support the F-PDCH. However, for intra-BSC handoffs to RBS not supporting the F-<br>
PDCH, or for inter-BSC handoffs to another BSC, the source BSC can switch the mobile<br>
station's packet data traffic from the F-PDCH to a F-SCH, with the advantage that the F-<br>
6<br><br>
SCH generally is supported by all RBSs, and can be maintained during soft handoffs<br>
between BSCs.<br>
Of course, the present invention's channel switchover methods are not limited to<br>
cdma2000 embodiments, nor limited to the above features and advantages. Those skilled<br>
in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
7<br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention comprises a base station<br>
method and apparatus for providing continued packet data service in cdma2000 networks,<br>
wherein high-rate shared packet data channels are supported in one service area, but not<br>
supported in an adjacent service area, or where no mechanism is provided to handoff such<br>
channels between service areas. However, the present invention can be broadly<br>
understood as providing a method and apparatus for changing the packet data service for a<br>
given mobile station from a channel type that cannot be handed off across service area<br>
boundaries, to a channel type that can be handed off.<br>
Fig. 1 thus illustrates two base stations 10, labeled "BS1" and "BS2" for<br>
convenience. BS1 can provide high-rate packet data service using a "Type 1" channel or<br>
using a "Type 2" channel, with these labels being generically representative of two<br>
different packet data channel types. In a cdma2000 embodiment, a Type 1 channel<br>
comprises the Forward Packet Data Channel (F-PDCH), which is a shared packet data<br>
channel that is configured to serve a plurality of packet data users at relatively high rates.<br>
In the same context, a Type 2 channel comprises a Forward Supplemental Channel (F-<br>
SCH), which is a dedicated (user-specific) channel that is configured to serve one packet<br>
data user at higher data rates than can be achieved with Forward Fundamental Channels<br>
(F-FCH). F-PDCHs are preferred over F-SCHs as being more efficient in terms of<br>
network resource utilization and because they generally offer higher effective data rates.<br>
For purposes of the illustration, one may assume that BS2 either lacks Type 1<br>
channel compatibility—i.e., it does not offer packet data service on Type 1 channels—or<br>
that no defined mechanism is available for handing off Type 1 channels between BS1 and<br>
BS2. Thus, Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary method of providing packet data service to a<br>
mobile station 12 that begins packet data service at time tl on a Type 1 packet data<br>
channel in a first service area associated with BS1, but later moves through a boundary<br>
region with an adjacent, second service area associated with BS2.<br>
As shown, the mobile station 12 enters the boundary region at time t2, but BS1<br>
continues packet data service to it on the Type 1 channel because it still has a radio link<br>
with the mobile station 12 that is of sufficient quality. Note that in one embodiment of the<br>
8<br><br>
present invention, BS1 may use its detection of the mobile station 12 entering a<br>
boundary region as a trigger to change channel types, regardless of whether it still has<br>
sufficient radio link quality relative to the mobile station 12 to maintain service on the<br>
Type 1 channel.<br>
As for detecting entry by the mobile station 12 into the boundary region, BS1 can<br>
do so based on monitoring signal quality reports from the mobile station 12. For example,<br>
when the mobile station 12 is in a boundary region, Periodic Pilot Strength Measurement<br>
Messages (PPSMMs), or the like, returned from the mobile station 12 will include pilot<br>
strength measurements for one or more neighboring base stations controlling the adjacent<br>
service areas associated with the boundary region. Thus, BS1 may detect that the received<br>
signal strength for its pilot is decreasing at the mobile station, while the received signal<br>
strength for BS2 is increasing.<br>
Thus, one might expect deteriorating radio link quality at the mobile station 12<br>
relative to BS1 and improving radio link quality relative to BS2, as the mobile station<br>
moves deeper into the boundary region from time t2 to time t3. Therefore, at some signal<br>
quality threshold, or based on evaluating the service quality associated with continued<br>
service on the Type 1 channel versus a service changeover to a Type 2 channel, BS1<br>
switches the packet data traffic for the mobile station 12 from the Type 1 channel to a<br>
Type 2 channel, which BS1 may setup and assign as part of the changeover process.<br>
Because the Type 2 channel is available in both service areas, and because handoff of<br>
Type 2 channels is supported across the boundary region, this action allows BS2 to begin<br>
serving the mobile station 12 on another Type 2 channel, such that the mobile station 12 is<br>
served on the Type 2 channels in soft handoff.<br>
Because BS1 still acts as the source or controlling base station, the packet data<br>
traffic targeted to the mobile station is transmitted by BS1 on its Type 2 channel, and also<br>
sent over sidehaul links between BS1 and BS2, for transmission by BS2 on its Type 2<br>
channel. With its packet data traffic being transmitted at least temporarily by both base<br>
stations, service to the mobile station 12 can be reliably maintained across and through the<br>
boundary region. Note that the data rate achievable on the Type 2 channel may not be as<br>
9<br><br>
high as previously achieved on the Type 1 channel under good signal conditions,<br>
even with the benefit of soft handoff diversity gains at the mobile station. Even so, once<br>
the signal quality of the Type 1 channel deteriorates beyond a given threshold, service<br>
quality on the Type 2 channel is likely to be superior, and likely represents a more<br>
efficient use of network resources.<br>
At some point, e.g., time t4, the mobile station 12 has moved through the boundary<br>
region and is entirely within the second service area, and thus may be out of the effective<br>
radio range of BS1. Packet data service continues, however, with BS2 providing service<br>
on the Type 2 channel assigned by it to the mobile station 12. Note, the data for<br>
transmission by BS2 still is being sent across the BS1-BS2 sidehaul links, and BS1 still<br>
operates as the source or controlling base station for the duration of the packet data call.<br>
Sometime later at time t5, the mobile station 12 moves back into the boundary<br>
region and it again may be served in soft handoff between BS1 and BS2 using Type 2<br>
channels. However, as mobile station 12 continues moving back toward BS1, such as<br>
shown at time t6, received signal quality at the mobile station 12 relative to BS1 generally<br>
improves. BS1 continues monitoring received signal quality reports from the mobile<br>
station 12 and, at some point, soft handoff with BS2 ends and BS1 may switch the packet<br>
data traffic for the mobile station 12 back to the Type 1 channel and tear down the Type 2<br>
channel.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates exemplary base station processing logic that embodies the above<br>
method of providing packet data service in and across packet data service boundaries. As<br>
is understood in the art, a typical base station comprises one or more general purpose<br>
and/or special purpose processing circuits that include one or more microprocessors,<br>
Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field<br>
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs),<br>
or other digital processing circuits. Thus, the illustrated processing logic can be<br>
implemented at base stations 10 in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the present invention is embodied as stored program instructions<br>
for execution by one or more digital processing circuits.<br>
10<br><br>
With that in mind, processing begins at a first base station 10 with establishing<br>
packet data service (call) to a mobile station 12 on a first type of packet data channel (Step<br>
100). At some point during the call, the base station 10 detects that the mobile station 12<br>
has moved into a service boundary region (Step 102). As noted, such detection can be<br>
based on a receiving signal quality reports from the mobile station 12, in which the pilot<br>
signal strengths from the first base station 10, and one or more neighboring, adjacent base<br>
stations 10 can be evaluated. In at least one embodiment, base stations 10 are configured<br>
to monitor the signal strengths of base stations designated as members of the mobile<br>
station's "active set" as the basis for determining whether the mobile station 12 is in a<br>
boundary region. Additionally, or alternatively, base stations 10 may be configured to<br>
monitor other forms of signal quality reports, such as the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)<br>
reports sent by certain types of CDMA mobile stations operating on high-speed shared<br>
packet data channels.<br>
However the first base station 12 is configured to detect boundary region operation<br>
of the mobile station 12, it is configured to selectively changeover the packet data service<br>
to the mobile station 12 from the first type of packet data channel to a second type of<br>
packet data channel responsive to such detection (Step 104). As previously described, this<br>
may comprise switching the mobile station's packet data traffic from a shared channel to a<br>
newly assigned dedicated channel. Further, the base station may place the mobile station<br>
12 into soft handoff on the newly assigned dedicated channel with one or more<br>
neighboring base stations 10 associated with the boundary area, and thus continue<br>
providing packet data service to the mobile station 12 via the one or more neighboring<br>
base stations (Step 106).<br>
Assuming that the mobile station 12 subsequently moves back into (or at least back<br>
toward) the service area of the first base station 10, such movement and concomitant<br>
improvement of received signal quality relative to the first base station 10 is detected (Step<br>
108). The first base station 10 may then selectively switch the packet data traffic for the<br>
mobile station back from the second type of packet data channel to the first type of packet<br>
data channel (Step 110). In a cdma2000-based embodiment, this step may comprise<br>
11<br><br>
changing the mobile station 12 from the previously assigned F-SCH back to the F-<br>
PDCH of the first base station 10. It should be understood, however, that base station 10<br>
may choose to continue serving the mobile station 12 on the second type of channel for the<br>
duration of the call, or at least for some desired time after mobile station 12 moves back<br>
within radio range of the first base station 10.<br>
For example, the first base station 10 may continue serving mobile station 12 on<br>
the second type of channel to preserve soft handoff conditions for as long as possible, or<br>
because serving it on its other type of packet data is not desirable given current network<br>
conditions, such as congestion or loading. For example, the first base station 10 could be<br>
configured to continue F-SCH service to the mobile station 12 if its shared F-PDCH is<br>
already congested, etc.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such details can be varied according to<br>
particular network capabilities, layouts, and service objectives. All such variations in<br>
triggering channel switchover as the mobile station 12 moves away from the source base<br>
station 10, or switchback as it moves back toward the source base station 10 are<br>
contemplated herein.<br>
Fig. 3 casts the above exemplary method of operation within the framework of an<br>
exemplary wireless communication network 20, which may be a cdma2000 network, for<br>
example. In the context of cdma2000 networks, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
the IS-2000 standards govern the air interface and signaling protocols, and that the IOS<br>
standards govern the inter-entity interfaces, e.g., the BS-to-BS signaling interfaces.<br>
With these points in mind, the exemplary network 20 comprises a Radio Access<br>
Network (RAN) 22, and a Packet Switched Core Network (PSCN) 24 that includes a<br>
Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) 26, which provides packet data routing and<br>
home/foreign agent advertisement functionality supporting packet data mobility<br>
management functions. Together, RAN 22 and PSCN 24 communicatively couple mobile<br>
stations 12 to one or more Public Data Networks (PDNs) 28, such as the Internet, and thus<br>
12<br><br>
allow mobile stations 12 to originate and terminate packet data calls with various<br>
other devices or systems having accessible via PDN(s) 28.<br>
RAN 22 supports packet data service across a range of service areas by providing a<br>
number of Base Station Controllers (BSCs) 30, with each BSC 30 controlling the<br>
operation of one or more Radio Base Stations (RBSs) 32. Further, each BSC 30 includes a<br>
Packet Control Function (PCF) 34, or is associated with one, for interfacing with the<br>
PDSN 26 of PSCN 24. That is, the PCFs 34 provide the Radio-Packet (RP) interface<br>
between the RAN 22 and the PSCN 24.<br>
The RBSs 32 typically are spaced apart to provide more or less overlapping radio<br>
coverage for a given geographic region, and each one of them specifically provides radio<br>
coverage in a corresponding "cell," which may be divided into a plurality of radio sectors.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, each illustrated RBS 32 provides coverage in each one<br>
of three sectors, labeled SI through S3. In the context of Figs. 1 and 2, and the<br>
corresponding discussion herein, the BSC/RBS combination may be understood as<br>
comprising a BS 10.<br>
Since those skilled in the art will appreciate that the radio transceiver circuits of<br>
each RBS 32 may be sectorized, such that each sector supported by the RBS 32 effectively<br>
is a different service area, it will be understood that the earlier described boundary regions<br>
exist at the borders between sectors. However, that understanding should be qualified by<br>
the statement that the boundary regions between sectors of the same RBS 32 generally are<br>
not problematic with respect to continuing packet data service to a mobile station 12 on<br>
the F-PDCH, as the packet data traffic for a given mobile station can be transferred from<br>
the F-PDCH being transmitted in one sector of a given RBS 32, to the F-PDCH of another<br>
sector of that same RBS 32 without difficulty.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment the present invention more particularly addresses the<br>
challenge of continuing packet data service to a given mobile station 12, where that<br>
service is being provided on the F-PDCH in one sector of a first RBS 32 as the mobile<br>
station 12 moves into the boundary region with one or more adjacent sectors controlled by<br>
13<br><br>
other RBS(s) 32. Another embodiment addresses the converse challenge of<br>
switching a given mobile station's packet data traffic from a F-SCH to a F-PDCH<br>
responsive to the mobile station 12 moving back into the service area of its source RBS<br>
32.<br>
For example, in Fig. 3, one might imagine RBS2 beginning service to the<br>
illustrated mobile station 12 on the F-PDCH of sector SI of RBS2. One might further<br>
imagine that mobile station 12 during that call moves toward the boundary region of sector<br>
SI of RBS2 and sector S3 of RBS3. It may be that RBS3 does not offer F-PDCH service,<br>
or it may be that network 20 is configured according to standards not providing for F-<br>
PDCH handoff between BSCs 30 (i.e., no provision for inter-BSC F-PDCH handoff), such<br>
that BSC1 and BSC2 cannot cooperate to continue F-PDCH packet data service as the<br>
mobile station 12 moves into (and possibly through) the boundary region of RBS2/S1 and<br>
RBS3/S3.<br>
Thus, BSC1 can be configured to monitor signal quality reports from the mobile<br>
station 12 as it operates within SI of RBS2, and to detect when it has moved into the<br>
boundary region. BSC1 may be further configured to terminate packet data service to the<br>
mobile station 12 on the F-PDCH of RBS2/S1, and assign a F-SCH to the mobile station<br>
12 in RBS2/S1, so that packet data service can be continued. As noted, the decision to<br>
switch the mobile station 12 from F-PDCH service to F-SCH service may additionally or<br>
alternatively be predicated on whether network resources are better utilized by continuing<br>
F-PDCH service or by switching to F-SCH service, and/or predicated on which channel<br>
type allows the mobile station's Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements to be met.<br>
Once the mobile station 12 has been changed over such that the packet data traffic<br>
formerly carried by the F-PDCH is now carried by a dedicated F-SCH, BSC1 may initiate<br>
soft handoff of the mobile station 12 with BSC2 as the target base station. In that manner,<br>
BSC1 can send the packet data traffic across the sidehaul links (e.g., A3/A7 interface) to<br>
BSC2, so that the packet data traffic can be transmitted on an additional F-SCH assigned<br>
to the mobile station 12 in sector S3 of RBS3. If, and when, the mobile station 12 moves<br>
14<br><br>
back toward RBS2, the process can be reversed and the mobile station's packet data<br>
traffic can be switched back to the F-PDCH of RBS2/S1.<br>
Also, similar processing can be applied to the scenario where the mobile station 12<br>
originates a voice call or a low-rate packet data call in SI of RBS2 for example. That call<br>
is supported by the assignment of a dedicated F-FCH, which may be carried in soft<br>
handoff across the boundary region and into S3 of RBS3, because sidehaul signaling<br>
between BSCs for F-FCH traffic is supported by the current IOS standards. If a F-SCH is<br>
then assigned to the mobile station 12 in S3 of RBS3 while that the F-FCH call is still<br>
active, BSC1 supports that call as the source base station, and F-SCH traffic for the mobile<br>
station 12 is sent from BSC1 across the sidehaul to BSC2, for transmission by RBS3 on<br>
the assigned F-SCH.<br>
In this scenario, according to the present invention, if the mobile station 12 then<br>
moves back toward a service area of BSC1, the packet data traffic being carried by the F-<br>
SCH can be switched over to a F-PDCH being transmitted in that service area of BSC1.<br>
Thus, where another BSC/RBS assigns a F-SCH to a given mobile station 12, the traffic<br>
may be later switched over to a F-PDCH. Of course, the process of making that<br>
switchover can be qualified by considering whether the current network resource<br>
availability conditions, and/or the current congestion conditions, favor the switchover<br>
from F-SCH service to F-PDCH service.<br>
Supporting these and other operations, Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary functional<br>
arrangement for a BSC 30 according to one or more embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The illustrated circuits may be implemented in hardware, software, or some combination<br>
thereof, and may comprise dedicated or shared circuits. BSC 30 as illustrated comprises<br>
communication/processing control circuits 40, which include, or are associated with, one<br>
or more evaluation circuits 42, selection circuits 44, PCF/PDSN interface circuits 46, and<br>
RBS interface circuits 48.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the exemplary BSC 30 is configured to serve the mobile<br>
station 12 on the first channel type while the mobile station 12 is within a first service area<br>
15<br><br>
of the BSC 30 (Step 120). BSC 30 is further configured selectively to switch the<br>
packet data traffic for a given mobile station 12 from a first type of packet data channel—<br>
e.g., a shared packet data channel—to a second type of packet data channel—e.g., a<br>
dedicated packet data channel—responsive, for example, to detecting that the mobile<br>
station 12 has moved into a service area boundary region (Step 122).<br>
Evaluation circuit(s) 42 are configured to support such operation by detecting that<br>
the mobile station 12 is in a boundary region based on, for example, monitoring the mobile<br>
station's active set, or a reduced subset of the active set, representing a subset of active set<br>
base stations particularly associated with high-rate packet data service to the mobile<br>
station 12. Once boundary region operation is detected, the selection circuit(s) 44 may be<br>
triggered to cause the communication processing/control circuit(s) 40 to switch the mobile<br>
station's packet data traffic from the first channel type to the second channel type.<br>
Alternatively, BSC 30 may be configured to keep serving the mobile station 12 on<br>
the first channel type, until the reception conditions at the mobile station 12 may such<br>
service undesirable in terms of received signal quality at the mobile station 12, and/or in<br>
terms of inefficient utilization of the first channel type. Also, the evaluation circuits 42<br>
and/or the selection circuits 44 may be configured to consider spreading code, transmit<br>
power, and other network resource availabilities in determining whether to switchover the<br>
mobile station's packet data traffic.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates source BSC processing logic supporting an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the above switchover evaluation process, wherein the source BSC 30 is<br>
serving a given mobile station 12 on a shared packet data channel, e.g., a F-PDCH. The<br>
source BSC 30 receives signal quality reports directly or indirectly from the mobile station<br>
12 (Step 124), and uses these reports to evaluate radio link quality for the radio link(s)<br>
established between one or more of its RBSs 32 and the mobile station 12 (Step 126).<br>
Generally, the radio link evaluation includes consideration of the radio link quality at the<br>
mobile station 12 relative to one or more RBSs 32 that are associated with one or more<br>
neighboring BSCs 30 that are potential handoff targets.<br>
16<br><br>
In one embodiment, the source BSC 30 compares its radio link quality for the<br>
mobile station 12 to one or more defined thresholds, which may be cast in terms of<br>
minimum received signal strength and/or in terms of minimum serving data rates or<br>
Quality-of-Service constraints (Step 128). If the source BSC 30 determines that it does<br>
not have at least one radio link with the mobile station 12 of sufficient quality to sustain<br>
shared packet data channel service, it stops packet data service to the mobile station 12 on<br>
the shared packet data channel—e.g., a F-PDCH—and begins service to the mobile station<br>
12 on a dedicated packet data channel—e.g., a F-SCH—which may be newly assigned for<br>
purposes of supporting this traffic switchover (Step 130).<br>
If, however, source BSC 30 determines that it still has sufficient link quality to<br>
support packet data service to the mobile station 12 on the shared packet data channel, it<br>
generally continues service on that channel. However, the source BSC 30 may make an<br>
additional evaluation (Step 132), wherein it determines whether continued service on the<br>
shared packet data channel is more advantageous (Step 134).<br>
As used here, "advantageous" may be defined in terms of network resource<br>
utilization for shared channel service as compared to the resource utilization if the mobile<br>
station 12 were switched over to a dedicated packet data channel. Advantageous also may<br>
be defined in terms of whether the shared channel or the dedicated channel (possibly in<br>
soft handoff with diversity gains) would provide better service to the mobile station 12. If<br>
it would be more advantageous to serve the mobile station 12 on the shared channel, then<br>
packet data service on the shared channel is continued (Step 136). Otherwise, if it would<br>
be more advantageous to serve the mobile station 12 on a dedicated channel, the packet<br>
data traffic for the mobile station 12 is switched from the shared channel to a dedicated<br>
channel.<br>
Thus, the decision to switchover the packet data traffic for a given mobile station<br>
from a F-PDCH to a F-SCH can be made based on comparing source and target base<br>
station pilot strengths as reported by the mobile station for its active set (or reduced active<br>
set) of base stations. That decision can be a simple one, such as where the changeover is<br>
made if the target base station provides a stronger pilot, or if there are more target base<br>
17<br><br>
station radio links of sufficient quality than there are source base station radio links.<br>
Or, the comparison can be more sophisticated, such as where the base station attempts to<br>
determine whether the mobile station 12 would be better served in terms of effective data<br>
rate, QoS, etc., by making, or not making, the switchover, as the mobile station 12 moves<br>
into a given boundary region. With that approach, the switchover can be delayed until the<br>
effective F-PDCH data rate for the mobile station falls below a minimum, and/or where<br>
the network determines that resource utilization conditions favor the discontinuation of F-<br>
PDCH packet data service and the allocation of a F-SCH to continue that service into (and<br>
across) a given boundary region.<br>
In any case, those skilled in the art should appreciate that the present invention is<br>
not limited by the foregoing discussion, nor by the accompanying figures. Rather, the<br>
present invention is limited only by the following claims, and their reasonable legal<br>

example, a source base station can be configured to switch packet data traffic for a mobile<br>
station from a shared packet data channel to a dedicated packet data channel as it<br>
approaches a shared channel service boundary. Additionally, the source base station can<br>
be configured to change the packet data service to the mobile station from a dedicated<br>
packet data channel to a shared packet data channel, such as when the mobile station<br>
moves back into the source base station's service area.<br>
