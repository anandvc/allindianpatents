BACKGROUND-FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned about extracting sugarcane juice.<br>
This invention relates to a (compact) portable sugarcane crusher for extracting juice with less effort.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the Present Art, sugarcane crusher consists of two (metallic) grooved rollers stacked one above another in a parallel axis with matching gear at each end. These grooved rollers are mounted between two (metallic) side frames provided with holes to mount these rollers on their ends. They are mounted vertically by providing suitable gap between the two rollers to crush the sugarcane when it is pushed through the rollers; This position is maintained by having two support studs-one stud above the top roller and second stud below the bottom roller. A small length of the bottom roller end is projected beyond the right hand bracket support so that a handle can fit on it. The rollers are manually rotated by fitting a handle on the extended roller shaft and rotating in the circular direction.Generally, the left hand side-other side support bracket is longer than the right hand support, and has one hole in the side bracket above the top side and second hole in the side bracket below the bottom side. These holes are provided to permanently fix the machine with a rigid support so that the machine remains steady at a place during the crushing operation of sugarcane."<br>
Once this machine is rigidly fixed, it is ready for use. A sugarcane is   pushed through between the rollers while handle is moved in circular (clockwise) manner. The juice flowing during crushing operation is collected in the vessel at the bottom. The handle is rotated till the entire length of sugarcane passes through the rollers. The crushed sugarcane length is folded by hand and again it is passed through the rollers while they are being rotated by the handle.This process is repeated till almost all the juice is taken out of the sugarcane. Then another piece of fresh sugarcane is taken and the process is repeated.<br>
1<br><br>
This mode of crushing requires considerable manual effort to rotate handle and consequently to crush sugarcanc between the rollcrs . The entire load of crushing directly comes on the handle. This is a restricting factor for its usage. Furthermore, to maintain the device steady in the position during crushing operation of sugarcane, it has to be feed in a given location. Also this is not handy at all the places. Since the machine has to be iked, arrangement has to he made for water for washing the machine after use only at the place of location and also for disposal of wash water. This also becomes a restricting factor (of cleaning) for its usage.<br>
Another type of model available is having three grooved rollers. Two grooved rollers with gears are held horizontally in the parallel axis between the side supporting frame and the third grooved roller with gear is stacked and mounted parallely above the two rollers. Sugarcane has to be pushed through between front two rollers while the rollers are rotated by the handle.The sugarcane is crushed and juice is collected at the bottom. Again direct effort is applied and process of passing sugarcane through the gap of rollers, folding the sugarcane and again passing it through the rollers is followed. This type of crusher also requires considerable manual effort and has to be mounted or fixed to prevent slippage during the process of juice extraction. It is difficult to operate this machine by one person. Additional help is generally required to extract the juice.<br>
In both the present art models i.e two and three rollerâ€”crushers, sugarcane is fed from one side and comes out from the other side of the rollers. Both the model also have to be fixed for having it steady in position during the crushing operation and also requires considerable manual effort in hand crushing.<br>
Motorized commercial models are available in present art machines, however they have to be fixed in a location to keep them in steady position during crushing operation aid they cannot be moved at will It can be made mobile by fitting on a "trolley" and shifting from place to place. This is not practicable in a domestic situation and also cannot be taken indoors at will.<br>
2<br><br>
          OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
 An object of the present invention is to provide a.compact  portable sugarcane crusher/juicer and also provide sugarcane   crusher with less effort for extracting juice.<br>
 Accordingly, the several objects and advantages of the    invention  are,<br>
     i.     It will be a portable sugarcane crusher/juicer. Both manual and motorized version can be portable and can be shifted from place  to place of choice and convinience at will<br>
    ii.      The amount of effort required in a hand model is very little   and<br>
can fee operated by person of almost any age.	<br>
    iii.        It is very handy where small quantities of juice is required over a longer period especially where therepeutic value gets involved               Other objects and advantages of the invention are	<br>
      i.   It does not have to be fixed for operating and extracting<br>
     sugarcane juice. Even motorized model of this invention<br>
     does not have to be fitted at a location.	<br>
     ii.     Wider usage of the machine is possible as better control can    be  excercised  on  hygienic  quality  of the juice.  A user because of portability of machine, can easily control the parity of the juice through proper cleaning and usage,                                       <br>
     iii.     The present. invention of four rollers- (3 grooved and one<br>
plain roller) sugarcane crusher/juicer can be cleaned with ease at the place of use and it also can be taken (portable; in<br>
use) to a wash place. There is a convinience in the process; of cleaning.<br>
iv.   The present invention because of its "portable" advantages and compactness can be used by all, as there will not be a space problem for installing the machine.The invention, can be stored anywhere and taken out to use as and when<br>
required  whereas  it  cannot be  done with  the present<br>
machine	<br>
v.    The manual effort required in hand model is very little as it is aided with reduction gear<br>
3<br><br>
The disadvantages of the present two and three roller model crusher/juicer as against this invention of four roller crusher is that, that both the Present two and three roller crusher have to be fitted before operating, the machine to extract sugarcane juice. Since they are fee/at a place, the present art of machine has to be cleaned at the same place (location of use) and consequently it makes it nrcessary to provide source of water for cleaning and disposal of "used" wash water This is a limiting factor of in convinience in the process.<br>
The further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawing and ensuing description.<br>

Motorised model:<br>
In the motorized model, the worm shaft (1) of the machine is coupled by a coupling with an electric motor of suitable size and fitted on to the Base Plate (6).<br>
OPERATION Of THEINVENTION<br>
Figure 5 is a sectional view of feeding and crushing of the sugarcane in two stages.<br>
Sugarcane stem is (22) introduced between the gap of the grooved<br>
rollers (8) &amp; (9) by the rotation of the handle (2) in the clockwise<br>
direction. These two grooved top rollers during the rotation grip the<br>
sugarcane between them.<br>
The rotating grooved rollers crush and flatten the sugarcane stem<br>
between them and force it to move further downward where it gets<br>
gripped between the rotating grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10).<br>
This sugarcane stem is further crushed and flattened between the<br>
grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) before it comes out from between them.<br>
The sugarcane juice is released in this process of initial crushing and<br>
flattening between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9) and subsequent<br>
crushing and flattening between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10).<br>
The sugarcane juice so released during both the stages of crushing and<br>
flattening passes through strainer (20) and is collected in the vessel<br>
(21) kept below the rollers on the Base plate (6).<br>
The flattened sugarcane stem which comes out from between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) is folded and reintroduced between the rotating grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9) through rotation of handle. The folded Sugarcane is further crushed between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9) and then between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10). Further juice is released in the process and is collected in the vessel (21).   "<br>
The folded and further crushed sugarcane stem which comes out from between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) is again refolded and reintroduced between the gap of the rotating rollers (8) &amp; (9) and is further crushed by the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) releasing more juice;<br>
6<br><br>
This process of folding and refolding and reintroducing sugarcane between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9) and coming out from between the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) is repeated till almost all the juice is extracted out of the First sugarcane stem.<br>
Thereafter Second sugarcane stem is taken and the process of juice extraction and collection is repeated till all the required stems are crushed and juice is collected from them.<br>
Too thick a stem of sugarcane which can not be introduced between the top-two the grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9) is first split vertically so as to have the sugarcane thickness suitable to be introduced between the top two grooved rollers (8) &amp; (9).<br>
The plain fourth roller (II) which is freely rotating between the side frames (12) &amp; (13) sufficiently guides sugarcane stem flattened by the grooved roller (8) &amp; (9) towards the rotating grooved rollers (8) &amp; (10) which in turn grips the flattened sugarcane during its downward movement <br>
COLLUSION:-<br>
The idea of plurality of rollers alongwith worm &amp; worm wheel drive makes it portable in use and also makes the process of taking out juice less strenuous.<br>
i.    The effort required by the invention is much less then the<br>
present art hand sugarcane crusher; ii.    It can be hand driven or It can be motorized without eliminating portability feature of the invention.<br>
iii.    It can be cleaned with ease at the place of use or it can be taken          to a wash place. There is convinience in the process of cleaning<br>
at will. Also better hygienic conditions can be maintained. iv.    It is not necessary to have it fixed at a location for extracting juice.<br>
7<br><br>
The above embodiment is an example and should not be considered as a limitation of other roller sizes or removing portability for domestic and/or commercial use The rollers can be bigger in diameter with and without a suitable motor for increasing the rate of juice extraction, The support &amp; other parts may be if needed made suitably stronger, portability feature in not a limiting factor.<br>
Such variation are within the scope of the invention Its scope should be construed and understood accordingly. Other applications of use can be considered by providing drive through extended shafts of the rollers.<br>
Thus the reader wilt see that the "Portable" - "Portability" of the invention proves highly reliable yet economical machine that can be easily operated with little effort and used by person of almost any age.<br>
While the above description contains many specification, these should not be constructed as limitation in the scope of invention but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof.<br>
Many other variations are possible, for example-<br>
a)	Changing of gap between the  rollers<br>
b)	Providingarrangem ent for adjustable gap variation<br>
c)	Increasing or decreasing numbers of rollers<br>
d)	Increasing or decreasing size of rollers<br>
e)	Changing shape of rollers - individuals and in combination<br>
f)	Made of different material<br>
g)	Adding to more versatility<br>
h) Feeding  from   bottom-back  for  crushing  small pieces  of<br>
sugarcane used for chewing i.e "Ganderi" i) Different types of gears and different arrangement of gears  j) Changing scale &amp; size of the machine k) Making modular or made integral or separately without loosing<br>
the advantage of portability and reduction in effort required for<br>
extraction of sugarcane juice<br>
