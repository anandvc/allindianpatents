A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY SUBSTANCE-<br><br>
Inventor: DR. SHRUTI UMESH BHAT , an Indian national C/o Unichem laboratories Ltd., Unichem Bhavan, Prabhat Estate, S.V.Road, Jogeshwari West, Mumbai 400102, India and residing at Shreyas , B-6 113 J.P.Road, Andheri (West), Mumbai 400058, India<br>
Applicant: Untchem laboratories Ltd, an Indian company, having office at Unichem Bhavan, Prabhat Estate, S.V.Road, Jogeshwari West, Mumbai 400102, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br>
Back ground of invention :<br>
The present invention relates to the process of preparation of pharmaceutical formulation containing a cyclo oxygenase inhibitor and cyclodextrin. The term "cycio oxygenase inhibitor" or " Cox inhibitor" interchangeably refers to a therapeutic compound, which inhibits the enzyme cycio- oxygenase. Phanmaceutically effective cycio- oxygenase inhibitors include for example Cox- inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug substances (NSAIDS).<br>
A "pharmaceuticady effective" amount of Cox inhibitor is an amount sufficient to provide the intended treatment in the body being treated (for e.g. to treat or prevent inflammation in a mammal). Cox enzyme has two isoforms: Cox 1 and Cox 2 enzyme. Cox- 2 enzyme is inducible by inflammation where as on the other hand inhibitor of Cox -2 enzyme accounts for the therapeutic benefits.<br>
The ability of Cox-2 inhibitors to selectively block formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins while sparing those that guard the gastro- intestinal tract makes them an attractive choice for long term use, such as in rheumatoid arthritis or osteo-arthritis. Several patents disclose different types of dosage forms of Cox-2 inhibitors and several routes of administration such as oral, parenteral, topical, rectal and intranasal have been described for the same. Also several delivery systems and technologies for development of Celecoxib, Meloxicam, Rofecoxib dosage forms have been disclosed in the prior art [WO 0038716, WO 0037107, WO 0205815, WO 0178724, WO 005319, WO 0051685, US 5633272, US 5643933, WO 9641626, US 5700816, WO 9641645, WO 9729775, WO 9729776, WO 9806708, WO 9816227, WO 9847509, WO 9922720, WO 9959635, WO 0012093, WO 9738986, WP 0927555, WO 03049720, WO 03051878, WO 03029230, WO 03032961, WO 03033001, WO 03035080, WO 03035081, WO 03039542, WO 03039599, US 2003119895, WO 03066030, US 2003130334, WO 03070233, WO 03065988, WO<br><br><br>

Compositions disclosed in the priort art employ large quantities of chlorinated or other aliphatic organic solvents during film -coating of granules or tablets which hazardous during industrial scale processing.<br>
Another important NSAID cox-inhibitor is Valdecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or a prodrug thereof. Valdecoxib has poor water solubility, extremely bitter and unpleasant taste and is sensitive to light. Commercially available Valdecoxib tablet compositions are therefore film coated either with cellulose or methacrylic or the like polymers .<br>
Use of cyclodextrin for forming complexes with cox-inhibitors such as those disclosed in present invention to impart photo-stability is hither to not reported.<br><br><br>
Moreover, taste-masking techniques as well as film coating techniques described in the prior art have one or more limitations such as:<br>
1.	Known processes are time consuming and present low yields of final product, thereby increasing production costs when produced on commercial scale.<br>
2.	Some of the processes employ large quantities of organic solvents such as methylene chloride, methanol, acetone which are hazardous and also less preferred for use in a pharmaceutical facility.<br>
3.	Some of the processes employed makes use of large quantities of polymers, cellulose derivatives or other coating aids for the purpose of taste masking there by increasing production run times and product cost.<br>
There is therefore, need to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of cox-inhibitors NSAID using cyclodextrins that would be novel, easy to process on industrial scale at an affordable cost to patient and do not employ large amounts of any hazardous organic solvents in the process of manufacture, avoid film-coating of drug granules or tablets or powder or crystals and give compositions with desired photo-stability and masked taste .<br>
Scope of the invention :-<br>
The objective of the present invention is to develop process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition containing a COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin.<br>
The further objection of the present invention is to develop process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition containing COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br><br>
or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin where in the bitter taste of the drug is masked.<br>
The further objective of the present invention is to develop process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition of COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin, which is safe and efficacious.<br>
The further objective of the present invention is to develop process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition of a COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin as a drug delivery system that is accurate in dosing as well as stable.<br>
The further objective of the present invention is to develop a process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition containing COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin that can be manufactured at an industrial scale and may not employ use of large amounts of any hazardous organic solvents during process of manufacture.<br>
The further objective of the present invention is to develop process to obtain a pharmaceutical composition of a COX-inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or prodrug thereof and a complexing agent such as cyclodextrin as a drug delivery system that is stable to light and therefore eliminates use of film-coating operation of drug granules or tablets or powder or crystals.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention :<br>
Cox- inhibitor compounds disclosed in the present invention may be used in their native forms or as salts. In cases, where forming a stable non-toxic acid or base salt is desired, administration of the compound as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acid that form a physiological acceptable anion for example tosyiate, methane, sulfonate, acetate citrate, maionate, tartarate, succinate, benezene sulfonate, benzoates, ascorbate, etoglutarate and glycerophosphate. Suitable in organic salts including hydrochloride, hydro bromide, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate and carbonate may also be formed insitu.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art for example reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.<br>
The term 'prodrug' refers to a chemical compound that can be converted into a therapeutic compound by metabolic or simple chemical process within the body of the subject.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds disclosed in the present application may have a chiral center and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism.<br>
Cox-inhibitor drug substances present in the pharmaceutical composition disclosed in the present invention encompass any racemic, optically active, polymorphic, tautomeric or<br><br><br>
stereoisomeric form or mixture thereof of the substance or its derivative or salt or prodrug that possesses the useful properties described therein. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for e.g. by resolution of the racemic forms through recrystallization techniques by synthesis from optically active starting materials by chiral synthesis or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationery phase) and how to determine anti-inflammatory activity using standard tests or other tests that are well-known in the art.<br>
The process disclosed in the present invention involves use of the NSAID substance or its derivative or salt or prodrug with cyclodextrin as a complex along with binder, disintegrating agents, lubricants, levigating agent and other additives.

2.	Transfer to a ball-mill containing balls made either or porcelain or stainless steel. Ball milling the blend for a definite period of time for e.g. 1 -14 hours preferably 2-6 hours with occasional scraping of the blend from the sides of the mill until a uniform soild complex is formed.<br>
3.	Screening the complex solid through 60 mesh.<br>
4.	Adding formulation additives such as binders, bulking agents levigating agents, surfactants, etc. and granulating the mass to form a dough.<br><br><br><br><br>
Wet screening of the above dough of step (4) through 8 mesh and drying the granules obtained at 60°C in a fluidized bed drier for 1-4 hours or in a tray drier for up to 12 hours until granules with moisture content between 2.5-3.0% w/w are obtained.<br>
6.	Blending the dried granules of step (5) with suitable excipients such as lubricants, disintegrants and glidants to form a suitable oral dosage form such as tablets or capsules.<br>
7.	The dough from step (4) may also be extruded through an extruder to form rods, which may be then spheronized through a marumerizer to form beads or pellets.<br>
8.	The beads or pellets from step (7) may be then either encapsulated into a hard gelatin capsule or compressed into tablets after incorporating suitable excipients scuh as lubricants, disintegrants and glidants.<br>
9.	The solid complex powder from step 3 may also be sterilized and filled aseptically in vials along with other ingredients such as pH modifiers, stabilizers, osmolality and tonicity adjusters to be administered as an ophthalmic preparation.<br>

The preferred active component of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is an inclusion complex of Valdecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a derivative or prodrug thereof and an un-substituted or substituted beta- or gamma cyclodextrin or<br><br><br>
atoricoxib or parecoxib or a pharmaceutically accepted salt or or a derivative or prodrug thereof and an unsubstituted or substituted beta-or gamma-cyclodextrin.<br>
The cox-2 inhibitor NSAID substance or its derivative or salt or prodrug and cyclodextrin may be premixed at ratios between 1:0.5 upto 1:100, but preferably at a ratio of 1:10, more preferably at 1:6. the cyclodextrin being incorporated may be either substituted or unsubstituted gamma or beta-cyclodextrin but preferably an unsubstituted beta or gamma cyclodextrin more preferably unsubstituted betacyclodextrin. The NSAID and cyclodextrin may be complexed with techniques well known such as by simple addition, phase coeservation, trituration, kneading or ball milling using stainless steel or porcelain balls, but preferably by ball milling technique followed by aqueous dispersion and spray or tray drying. The complex is evaluated using DSC (Differential scanning colorimetry) and IR (infra red) techniques to investigate complexation procedure.<br>
Several formulation additives viz. binders for example acacia, cellulose, chitosan, gellan, saccharides, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, gelatin, pre-gelatinised starch, liquid glucose, sorbitol, maltol etc. may be used; but preferably polyvinyl pyrollidone may be used. Bulking agents for example calcium carbonate, diclacium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, dextrose, mannitol hydroxypropyl ceitufose, \actose} starch, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, sugars etc., may be incorporated but preferably microcrystalline cellulose and lactose may be used. Levigating agents such as water, isopropyl, alcohol, water-isopropanol mixture, ethyl alcohol etc. may be used, but preferably water may be used.<br>
Surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate 80, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, chremophore RH, poloxamer, hydrogenated castor waxes etc. may be incorporated into the formulation,  but polysorbate 80 and PEG 6000 may be used.  Disintegrants amongst<br><br><br>
crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, starch, cros-iinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium starch glycollate, partially pre-gelainised starch etc., may be used but preferably crospovidone and colloidal silicon dioxide are used.<br>
The NSAID substance such as valdecoxib or its derivative or salt or prodrug as a cyclodextrin complex after addition of suitable fillers and or processing may be compressed into either a conventional, effervescent, chewable or a dispersible tablet or encapsulated into a hard gelatin capsule or filled as dry powder into bottle to be reconstituted with water prior to use. Suitable chemical and microbial preservatives such as sodium benzoate, parahydroxy benzoates and soluble salts thereof, butylated hydroxy anisole, butylated hydroxy toluene, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, edetates, sodium chloride, propyl gallate, sodium ascorbate, sodium metabisulfite, sorbic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, triacetin, bronopol, sodium bicarbonate etc. in effective concentration may be incorporated into the formulation.<br>
Several ratios of 1:0 to 1:25 of flavouring agents such as cherry, butterscotch, mango, pineapple, orange, peppermint, mixed fruit, caramel, blackcurrent, raspberry, vanilla, spearmint etc., shall be added to the formulation. In addition, soluble or lake colours such as sunset yellow, caramel, quionoline yellow, tartrazine yellow, ponceau red, erythrosine pink, iron oxides etc., wherever necessary may be incorporated into the formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of cyclodextrin with COX-2 inhibitor NSAID substance such as Valdecoxib or its derivative or salt or prodrug has been evaluated in-vitro for its disintegration time, uniformity of dispersion, assay, dissolution in surrogate biological fluids and photo-sensivity to natural and UV light.<br><br><br><br><br>
Studies for drug availability for absorption with respect to time using in the-vitro dissolution rate test the formulation containing complex disclosed in the present invention showed superior drug solubility measured as amount of drug dissolved in simulated gastric or simulated intestinal fluid versus time in comparison with commercially available Valdecoxib tablets used as reference products. Due to enhanced dissolution, oral formulations according to the invention containing Valdecoxib propose to exhibit increased drug availability than that observed with reference products. Also, the impurity profile of Valdecoxib complex complies acceptance criteria when compared with plain drug .<br>
The pharmaceutical composition so developed by the process of the present invention has been evaluated for stability at several combinations of temperature and relative humidity viz 25 deg. C -60% RH, 30 deg. C - 70% RH, 40 deg. C. Ambient room temperature - RH 60 deg. C, 90% RH as well as under ultraviolet and fluorescence light etc., for a period between 1-36 months.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition so developed by the process of the present invention has been analyzed by chromatographic techniques viz.HPLC and was found to be stable and the quantity of the medicament as well as impurities / related substances well within specified limits. Since complexation of NSAID substance, valdecoxib such as those disclosed in the present invention with "cyclodextrin" prevented degradation of the drug as well as taste-masked the bitter drug, therefore film coating of valdecoxib tablet or granules or powder or crystals for formulation of the pharmaceutical composition could therefore be omitted.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition so developed by the process of the present invention was found to be safe, stable, and efficacious accurate in dosing. It could be employed on the industrial scale for the purpose of commercialization as was indicated by the encouraging results of the pilot scale-up batches. As film-coating operation has been omitted in the<br><br><br>
process of the present invention, the process therefore does not employ any organic solvent and hence saves cost use of expensive film coating materials in the final product.<br>
