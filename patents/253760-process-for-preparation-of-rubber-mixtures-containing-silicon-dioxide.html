				<td>Methods for Providing Oxidatively Stable Ophthalmic Compositions<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for providing ophthalmic<br>
compounds that display oxidative stability, during processing, autoclaving,<br>
packaging, shipping or storage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therapeutic agents for topical administration to the eye are generally<br>
formulated in either a liquid or gel form and must be kept sterile until<br>
administration. Accordingly, ophthalmic therapeutic agents are either packaged<br>
asceptically, which is cumbersome and expensive or are heat sterilized.<br>
Unfortunately, many therapeutic agents are not oxidatively stable, especially at<br>
elevated temperatures.<br>
EDTA has been used to improve the stability of certain therapeutic agents<br>
during autoclaving. However, there remains a need for processes capable of<br>
stabilizing unstable therapeutic agents that are susceptible to oxidative degradation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method comprising removing at least about 80%<br>
oxygen from an ophthalmically compatible solution comprising at least one<br>
oxidatively unstable ophthalmic compound.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises, consists of and consists essentially of<br>
stabilizing at least one oxidatively unstable ophthalmic compound dissolved in an<br>
ophthalmically compatible solution by removing at least about 80% oxygen from<br>
said ophthalmically compatible solution comprising at least one oxidatively unstable<br><br>
ophthalmic compound. In some embodiments at least about 90% of said oxygen is<br>
removed. In some embodiments at least about 95% of said oxygen is removed and<br>
in still other embodiments at least about 99% of said oxygen is removed.<br>
As used herein, oxidatively unstable ophthalmic compound ("OUOC") is any<br>
therapeutic agent which shows greater than 10% degradation when autoclaved in<br>
solution with at least one oxidative catalyst, but shows less than 10% degradation<br>
when autoclaved under the same conditions without said at least one oxidative<br>
catalyst. Oxidative instability may be measured by forming a solution of 3 ml<br>
packing solution containing 25 ppm of the therapeutic agent to be evaluated, and<br>
exposing the solution, with and without oxidative catalysts (100 ppm Cu2O and 100<br>
ppm FeSO4) to autoclave conditions (120°C for 20 minutes).<br>
Examples of OUOC include oxidatively unstable pharmaceutical and<br>
nutraceutical compounds. In one embodiment the OUOC comprises at least one<br>
pharmaceutically active amines. In one embodiment the at least one OUOC<br>
comprises at least one tertiary cyclic amine. In another embodiment the at least one<br>
OUOC comprises at least one tertiary cyclohexyl amine. In another embodiment the<br>
OUOC comprises at least one therapeutic agent selected from as acycylovir,<br>
adrenalone, aminocaproic acid, amoxicillin, amotriphene, amoxecaine, amodiaquin,<br>
antazoline, atrophine, betaxolol, bupivacaine, carbachol, carteolol, chlorampenicol,<br>
chlortetracycline, corynathine, cromalyn sodium, cyclopentolate, demecarium,<br>
dexamethasone, dichlorphenamide, dibutoline, diclophenac, dipivefrin, ephedrine,<br>
erythromycin, ethambutol, eucatropine, fluoromethalone, gentamycin, gramicidin,<br>
homatropine, indomethacin, ketotifen, levallorphan, levobunolol, levocabastine,<br>
lidocaine, lignocaine, lomefloxacin, medrysone, mepivacaine, methazolamide,<br>
naphazoline, natamycin, natamycin, neomycin, noradrenaline, ofloxacin,<br>
oxybuprocaine, oxymetazoline, pheniramine, phenylephrine, physostigmine,<br>
pilocarpine, polymyxin B, prednisolone, proparacaine, pyrilamine, scopolamine,<br>
sorbinil, sulfacetamide, tamoxifen, tetracaine, tetracycline, tetrahydozoline, timolol,<br><br>
trifluridine, tropicamide, vidarabine, and salts and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
nutriceutical compounds include vitamins and supplements such as vitamins A, D,<br>
E, lutein, zeaxanthin, lipoic acid, flavonoids, ophthalmicially compatible fatty acids,<br>
such as omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, combinations thereof, combinations with<br>
pharmaceutical compounds and the like. In yet another embodiment the OUOC<br>
comprises at least one therapeutic agent selected from ketotifen fumarate, nor<br>
ketotifen fumarate, ,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperidinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-<br>
b][3]benzazepine-3-carboxaldehyde (CAS# 147084-10-4, olapatadine and mixtures<br>
thereof. In yet another embodiment the OUOC comprises at least one therapeutic<br>
agent selected from ketotifen fumarate, 11-dihydro-l 1-(1-methyl-4-<br>
piperidinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benzazepine-3-carboxaldehyde (CAS#<br>
147084-10-4 and mixtures thereof.<br>
The concentration of the OUOC in the ophthalmically compatible solutions<br>
of the present invention may range from about 10 ppm to about 100,000 ppm, in<br>
some embodiments from about 10 to about 10,000 ppm, in some embodiments from<br>
about 10 to about 1,000 ppm and some embodiments from about 10 to about 500<br>
ppm.<br>
The process of the present invention comprises removing at least 80%<br>
oxygen from the ophthalmically compatible solution comprising at least one OUOC.<br>
In some embodiments the amount of oxygen removed is at least about 90%, at least<br>
about 95%, and even at least about 99%. The oxygen removal is conducted prior<br>
to heat sterilization, such as autoclaving. For example, oxygen removal may be<br>
conducted either before or after the OUOC is added to the ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution. If the oxygen removal is conducted before the OUOC is added<br>
to the ophthalmically compatible solution, the solution should be kept under<br>
conditions sufficient to prevent oxygen from being introduced into the<br>
ophthalmically compatible solution during mixing and autoclaving.<br><br>
The oxygen may be removed by a number of methods including sparging,<br>
alternating freezing and thawing cycles, vacuum removal, vacuum removal in<br>
combination with agitation, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
When sparging is used at least one inert gas which is capable of displacing<br>
oxygen is bubbled through the ophthalmically compatible solution under conditions<br>
suitable to remove the desired amount of oxygen. Suitable inert gasses include<br>
nitrogen, argon, helium, combinations thereof and the like. Suitable sparging<br>
conditions include volumes of ophthalmically compatible solution of at least about<br>
1L, between about 1 and about 6L; and between about 1 and about 4L. In some<br>
embodiments a volume of about 2L is desirable. The inert gas flow rate may be<br>
selected based upon the selected volume and desired sparging time. So, for<br>
example, higher volumes may require higher inert gas flow rates, sparging times or a<br>
combination of both. Suitable inert gas flow rates include from about 10 to about<br>
1000 standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM). In some embodiments an inert<br>
gas flow rate of about 370 SCCM is desirable.<br>
Sparging times may vary based upon the other conditions as described<br>
above. Suitable sparging times include at least about 5 minutes, from about 5<br>
minutes to 24 hours, from 5 minutes to 12 hours and in some embodiments at least<br>
about 8 hours.<br>
Any temperature can be used for sparging so long as the ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution remains a liquid and the OUOC is soluble in the ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution at the selected temperature. Temperatures between about 0 to<br>
about 40°C may be used in some embodiments.<br>
Alternatively the oxygen may be removed by freeze thaw degassing.<br>
Suitable pressures for freeze thaw degassing include those less than about 660<br>
mmHg. For degassing an aqueous solution at room temperature, pressures between<br>
660 and 760mm Hg are desirable. Gentle agitation or sonication increases the<br>
efficiency of the process.<br><br>
When sparging is used the process of the present may also include agitation<br>
which may be provided by any known method such as, but not limited to sonication,<br>
stirring, rolling, shaking, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Freeze thaw degassing comprises freezing the ophthalmically compatible<br>
solution to form a solid and then thawing the solid. This process may be repeated.<br>
Alternatively, the ophthalmically compatible solution may be exposed to<br>
degas conditions below its vapor pressure. For example, if an ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution's boiling point at a given pressure is 20°C, the solution is cooled<br>
to less than about 20°C prior to evacuating the system to the desired pressure. When<br>
placed under a vacuum, all dissolved gases are removed from the ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution, while little or none of the other components (solvents or<br>
solutes) are displaced. Once the gas bubbles cease to escape from the<br>
ophthalmically compatible solution, the system is placed under a positive pressure of<br>
an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, and allowed to warm up to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
The degassing cycle described above may be repeated once or more<br>
depending on how sensitive the ophthalmically compatible solution is to oxidative<br>
degradation, with solutions which are more susceptible to degradation being<br>
subjected to more cycles.<br>
The ophthalmically compatible solution may be formed from any suitable<br>
ophthalmically compatible carrier. Suitable carriers include water, saline solution,<br>
mineral oil, petroleum jelly, water soluble solvents, such as C15-20 alcohols, C15-20<br>
amides, C 15-20 alcohols substituted with zwitterions, vegetable oils or mineral oils<br>
comprising from 0.5 to 5% by weight hydroxyethylcellulose, ethyl oleate,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and other non-toxic water-soluble<br>
polymers for ophthalmic uses, such as, for example cellulose derivatives, such as<br>
methylcellulose, alkali metal salts of carboxy-methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, methylhydroxypropyl-cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br><br>
chitosan and scleroglucan, acrylates or methacrylates, such as salts of poly(acrylic<br>
acid) or ethyl acrylate, polyacry lam ides, natural products, such as gelatin, alginates,<br>
pectins, tragacanth, karaya gum, xanthan gum, carrageenin, agar and acacia, starch<br>
derivatives, such as starch acetate and hydroxypropyl starch, and also other synthetic<br>
products, such as poloxamers, e.g. Poloxamer F127, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl<br>
methyl ether, polyethylene oxide, cross-linked poly(acrylic acid), such as neutral<br>
Carbopol, or mixtures of those polymers. Preferred carriers are water, cellulose<br>
derivatives, such as methylcellulose, alkali metal salts of carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, neutral Carbopol, or mixtures thereof. The concentration of<br>
the carrier is, for example, from 0.1 to 100000 times the concentration of the active<br>
ingredient combinations thereof and the like. When the ophthalmically compatible<br>
solution is an eye drop, suitable carriers include water, pH buffered saline solution,<br>
mixtures thereof and the like.<br>
The ophthalmically compatible solution of the present invention may also be<br>
used as the packaging or storage solution for an ophthalmic device, such as a contact<br>
lens. When the ophthalmically compatible solution is used as a packaging solution<br>
for a contact lens the carrier comprises a buffered saline solution. Any contact lens<br>
could be packaged with the ophthalmically compatible solution of the present<br>
invention, including conventional and silicone hydrogel contact lenses, such as but<br>
not limited to commercially available hydrogel formulations such as etafilcon,<br>
polymacon, vifilcon, genfilcon A, lenefilcon A, galyfilcon, senofilcon, balafilcon,<br>
lotrafilcon A, lotrafilcon B and the like.<br>
The ophthalmically compatible solution of the present invention may further<br>
comprise additional components such as antioxidants, demulcents, antibacterial<br>
agents, solubilizers, surfactants, buffer agents, tonicity adjusting agents, chelating<br>
agents, preservatives, wetting agents, thickeners, stabilizers, combinations thereof<br>
and the like. An example of a suitable stabilizer includes EDTA. The<br><br>
ophthalmically compatible solution of the present invention are ophthalmically<br>
compatible, and have a pH between about 5 and about 9, in some embodiments<br>
between about 6 to about 8 is desired.<br>
The ophthalmically compatible solution of the present invention may be<br>
formed by mixing the OUOC and any additional components with the selected<br>
carrier. When a liquid composition, such as an eye drop or packaging solution for a<br>
contact lens, the OUOC and any additional components are dissolved in the carrier.<br>
It is generally desirable that the shelf life of the ophthalmically compatible<br>
solution be in excess of about 6 months, and in some instances greater than about 1<br>
year, or even more than about 2 years. During the shelf life of the ophthalmically<br>
compatible solution it is desirable that at least about than 80% of the original<br>
concentration of the OUOC remains, and in some embodiments greater than about<br>
90%.<br>
The ophthalmically compatible solution of the present invention may in<br>
some embodiments further comprise at least one electron rich polymer. Suitable<br>
electron rich polymers are water-soluble, comprise at least one group with a free<br>
electron pair, have a weight average molecular weight, Mw, between about 1000<br>
and about 2,000,000, and are substantially free from transition metal containing<br>
species. In some embodiments the electron rich polymers are substantially free from<br>
copper and iron containing species. As used herein, "substantially free from" means<br>
that transition metal containing species are present in the electron rich polymer in<br>
amounts which are insufficient to cause further degradation of the OUOC.<br>
Preferably the transition metal containing species are present in the electron rich<br>
polymer in amounts less than about 100 ppm, in some embodiments less than about<br>
50 ppm and in some embodiments less than about 20 ppm.<br>
As used herein, water soluble means that the selected electron rich polymer<br>
does not precipitate or form visible gel particles at the concentrations selected and<br><br>
across the temperatures and pH regimes common for manufacturing, sterilizing and<br>
storing ophthalmic solutions.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the molecular weight is determined using a gel<br>
permeation chromatograph with a 90° light scattering and refractive index detectors.<br>
Two columns of PW4000 and PW2500, a methanol-water eluent of 75/25 wt/wt<br>
adjusted to 50mM sodium chloride and a mixture of polyethylene glycol and<br>
polyethylene oxide molecules with well defined molecular weights ranging from<br>
325,000 to 194 are used.<br>
Suitable examples of electron rich polymers include polymers comprising<br>
esters, acids, amines, carbonates, carboxylates, thiols, lactates, amides, carbamates,<br>
phosphates, nitriles, lactams, and combinations thereof. Polymers which do not<br>
have groups with at least one free electron pair, such as polymers comprising only<br>
ether groups, alcohol groups or combinations thereof are not electron rich polymers<br>
are defined herein. A wide concentration of electronic donating groups may be<br>
included, however, the higher the concentration of electron donating groups, the less<br>
electron rich polymer will need to be used. Specific examples include<br>
homopolymers and random or block copolymers of methacrylic acid, acrylic acid,<br>
itaconic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, vinylpyrollidone, vinylmethacetimide,<br>
combinations thereof and the like. More specific examples include poly(acrylic<br>
acid), poly(vinylpyrollidone) and poly(vinylmethylacetamide) and combinations<br>
thereof and the like. In one embodiment the electron rich polymer comprises<br>
poly(acrylic acid).<br>
The electron rich polymer is present in the ophthalmically compatible<br>
solution in stabilizing effective amounts. A stabilizing effective amount will vary<br>
depending upon the OUOC, the concentration of the OUOC and the concentration of<br>
other components in the ophthalmically compatible solution, but generally<br>
stabilizing effective amounts are those sufficient to provide at least about a 5%<br>
improvement in stability. Suitable amounts of'electron rich polymer include<br><br>
between about 10 and about 5,000 ppm, in some embodiments between about 100<br>
and about 5,000 ppm, in some embodiments between about 500 and about 3,000<br>
ppm.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as well<br>
as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention. However,<br>
those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
Examples 1<br>
A buffer solution was formed by dissolving 8.3 gm NaCl (from Sigma Aldrich), 9.1<br>
gm boric acid (from Mallinckrodt) and 1 gm sodium borate (from Mallinckrodt) in<br>
1L deionized water (from Milli Q). The resulting solution had a pH of 7.65.<br>
Ketotifen fumarate (from Sigma Aldrich) was added to prepare a solution of<br>
approximately 80 ppm in the buffer solution. The ketotifen solution (3 mL) was<br>
placed in vials, autoclaved for the number of cycles shown in Table 1, below and<br>
analyzed as a function of autoclave cycle (3 replicate per autoclave cycle) using<br>
HPLC using an HP 1100 and an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 and Rapid<br>
Resolution HT 50 x 4.6 mm x 1.8 µ. column and the following conditions:<br>
Detector Wavelength :	299 nm<br>
Flow rate:	1.0 mL/min<br>
Injection Volume:	3 µL<br>
Mobile Phase:<br>
Eluent A: 17 % acetonitrile in 0.025 M dihydrogen potassium phosphate<br>
buffer<br>
0.2 % triethylamine, 0.13 % o-phosphoric acid<br>
Eluent B: 50 % acetonitrile in 0.025 M dihydrogen potassium phosphate<br>
buffer<br>
0.2 % triethylamine, 0.13 % o-phosphoric acid<br><br><br>
The results in Table 1 clearly show that even a single autoclave cycle has a<br>
substantial detrimental effect on the ketotifen concentration in a buffer solution.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated, except that the buffer solution was sparged (with<br>
nitrogen) overnight (-12 hrs) at about 370 standard cubic centimeter per minute<br>
(SCCM) and subsequently transferred to a nitrogen box (
ketotifen solution of about 90 ppm was prepared and placed in vials as described<br>
above, but in nitrogen box. The vials were autoclaved and analyzed as described in<br>
Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2, below.<br><br><br>
Comparing the results in Table 2 to those in Table 1, it is clear that sparging<br>
the buffer solution and maintaining the ketotifen solution under nitrogen<br>
significantly improved (from 0 to 98%) the ketotifen stability.<br>
Example 3 and 4<br>
Examples 1 and 2 was repeated, except that 10 gm of poly(acrylic acid)<br>
(PAA, Mw, 225,000, from Polysciences, Inc., 20 % in water) was added to the<br>
buffer solution. The vials were autoclaved and analyzed as described in Example 1.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3, below.<br><br>
The results for Example 3 (inclusion of an electron rich polymer, such as<br>
PAA, with no sparging) are far superior to those of Example 1 (no electron rich<br>
polymer, no sparging). However, even with an electron rich polymer some ketotifen<br>
is lost after multiple autoclaving cycles. However, Example 4 (electron rich<br>
polymer and sparging) shows improved stability of the oxidatively unstable<br>
ophthalmic composition. Thus the foregoing examples clearly show that removing<br>
oxygen from the ophthalmically compatible solution significantly improves the<br>
stability of an oxidatively unstable ophthalmic composition, like ketotifen fumarate.<br><br>
