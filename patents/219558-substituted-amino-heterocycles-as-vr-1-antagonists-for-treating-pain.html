				<td>SUBSTITUTED AMINO HETEROCYCLES AS VR-1 ANTAGONISTS FOR<br>
TREATING PAIN<br>
The present invention is concerned with substituted amino-heterocycles and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof which are useful as therapeutic compounds, particularly in the treatment of pain and other conditions ameliorated by the modulation of the function of the vanilloid-1 receptor (VRl).<br>
The pharmacologically active ingredient of chilli peppers has been recognised for some time to be the phenolic amide capsaicin. The application of capsaicin to mucous membranes or when injected intradermally, causes intense burning-like pain in humans. The beneficial effects of topical administration of capsaicin as an analgesic is also well established. However, understanding of the underlying molecular pharmacology mediating these responses to capsaicin has been a more recent development.<br>
The receptor for capsaicin, termed the vaniUoid VR1 receptor, was cloned by Caterina and colleagues atUCSF in 1997 (Nature, 398:816, 1997). VRl receptors are cation channels that are found on sensory nerves that innervate the skin, viscera, peripheral tissues and spinal cord. Activation of VRl elicits action potentials in sensory fibres that ultimately generate the sensation of pain. Importantly VRl receptor is activated not only by capsaicin but also by acidic pH and by noxious heat stimuli. It is also sensitized by a number of inflammatory mediators and thus appears to be a polymodal integrator of painful stimuli.<br>
The prototypical VRl antagonist is capsazepine (Walpole etal., J. Med. Chem., 37:1942,1994) - VRl ICSO of 420nM. A novel series of sub-micromolar antagonists has also been reported recently (Lee etal, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 9:1713, 2001), but these reports provide no evidence for in vivo efficacy. A much higher affinity antagonist has been derived from the 'ultra-potent' agonist resiniferatoxin. lodo-resiniferatoxin (Wahl etal., MoL Pharmacol, 59:9, 2001) is a nanomolar antagonist of VRl but does not possess properties suitable for an oral pharmaceutical. This last is also true of the micromolar peptoid antagonists described by Garcia-Martinez (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd., USA, 99:2374, 2002). Most recently International (PCT) patent publication No. WO 02/08221 has described a novel series of VRl antagonists,<br>
which are stated to show efficacy in a number of animal models. We herein describe another novel series of VRl modulators. These comprise predominantly VRl antagonists but encompass VRl partial antagonists and VRl partial agonists. Such compounds have been shown to be efficacious in animal models of pain.<br>

As used herein, the term "fused 9 or 10 membered bicyclic heteroaromatic ring system" means a 6,6-, 6,5- or 6,6-fused ring system wherein one or both rings contain ring heteroatoms. The ring system is preferably aromatic or partially saturated, thus the ring system preferably comprises an aromatic 6-membered ring fused to a 5-or 6-membered ring which may be unsaturated, partially saturated or saturated. When the ring system contains more than one ring<br>
heteroatom at least one such heteroatom is nitrogen. It will be appreciated that where one of the ring heteroatoms is a nitrogen atom, such heteroatom may be at the bridgehead position of the fused ring system. It will also be appreciated that where one of the ring heteroatoms in a saturated ring is sulfur, such heteroatom may be oxidized to a S(O) or S(0)a moiety. Likewise, any carbon atom in a saturated ring may be oxidized to a C=0 moiety.<br>

In a further aspect of the present invention, the compounds of formula (D may be prepared in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, especially an acid addition salt.<br>
For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) will be non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound<br>
according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid. Salts of amine groups may also comprise quaternary ammonium salts in which the amino nitrogen atom carries a suitable organic group such as an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aralkyl moiety. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts.<br>
The salts may be formed by conventional means, such as by reacting the free base form of the compound of formula (I) with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is removed in vacua or by freeze drying or by exchanging the anions of an existing salt for another anion on a suitable ion exchange resin.<br>
The present invention also includes within its scope N-oxides of the compounds of formula (I) above. In general, such N-oxides may be formed on any available nitrogen atom. The N-oxides may be formed by conventional means, such as reacting the compound of formula (I) with oxone in the presence of wet alumina.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of formula (I) above. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound of formula (I). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
A prodrug may be a pharmacologically inactive derivative of a biologically active substance (the "parent drug" or "parent molecule") that requires transformation within the body in order to release the active drug, and that has improved delivery properties over the parent drug molecule. The transformation in vivo may be, for example, as the result of some metabolic process, such as chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of a carboxylic, phosphoric or sulphate ester, or reduction or oxidation of a susceptible functionality.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope solvates of the compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof, for example, hydrates.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may have one or more asymmetric centres, and may accordingly exist both as enantiomers and as diastereoisomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in tautomeric forms and the invention includes within its scope both mixtures and separate individual tautomers.<br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of formula (I) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
Preferably the compositions according to the invention are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices, suppositories, creams or gels; for oral, parenteral, intrathecal, intranasal, sublingual, rectal or topical administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Oral compositions such as tablets, pills, capsules or wafers are particularly preferred. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tabletting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid pre-formulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these pre-formulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid pre-formulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 600 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Favoured unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 500 mg, for example 1, 5,10, 25, 50,100, 300 or 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the<br>
advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
In the treatment of painful conditions such as those listed below, a suitable dosage level is about 1.0 mg to 15 g per day, preferably about 5.0 mg to 1 g per day, more preferably about 5 mg to 500 mg per day, especially 10 mg to 100 mg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
It will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of formula CD required for use in any treatment will vary not only with the particular compounds or composition selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated, and the age and condition of the patient, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician.<br>

Biological Methodology<br>
Determination of in vitro activity<br>
CHO cells, stably expressing recombinant human VR1 receptors and plated into black-sided 384-well plates, were washed twice with assay buffer (Hepes-buffered saline) and then incubated with luM Fluo-3-AM for 60 minutes in darkness. Cells were washed twice more to remove excess dye, before being placed, along with plates containing capsaicin and test compounds in a Molecular Devices FLIPR. The FLIPR simultaneously performed automated pharmacological additions and recorded fluorescence emmission from Fluo-3. In all experiments, basal fluorescence was recorded, before addition of test compounds and subsequent addition of a previously determined concentration of capsaicin that<br>
evoked 80% of the maximum respsonse. Inhibition of capsaicin evoked increases in intracellular [Ca2+] were expressed relative to wells on the same plate to which capcaicin was added in the absence of test compounds. Increases in intracellular [Ca2*] occuring after addition of test compound alone, prior to addition of capsaicin, allow determination of intrinsic agonist or partial agonist activity, if present. All the above compounds had an ICso of below 2uM.<br>
Determination of in vivo efficacy in a capsaicin paw flinch model (Method adapted from Taniguchi et al, 1997, Br JPharmacol. 122(5)-'809-12) To determine in vivo functional occupancy of VR1 receptors, compounds are administered orally to male Sprague Dawley rats typically 1 hour prior to receiving an intraplantar injection of capsaicin (2Tg dissolved in ethanol) and the number of flinches of the injected paw is recorded for 5 minutes immediately thereafter. Statistical analysis is performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test! p values 
Determination of in vivo efficacy in a model of inflammatory pain (Method adapted from Hargreaves etal, 1988 Pain, 32(l):77-88). Antinociceptive activity is determined using a rat carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia assay. Inflammatory hyperalgesia is induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenan (lambda-carrageenan 0.1 ml of 1% solution made up in saline) into one hind paw. Compounds are given orally typically 2 hours after carrageenan and paw withdrawal latencies determined 1 hour later. Paw withdrawal latencies to application of noxious thermal stimuli to plantar surface of the hind paw are measured using the Hargreaves apparatus. Thermal hyperalgesia is defined as the difference in paw withdrawal latencies for saline/vehicle- and carrageenan/vehicle-treated rats. Paw wthdrawal latencies for drug treated rats are expressed as a percentage of this response. Statistical analysis is performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test» p values
