				<td>The present invention relates to a thiazolo -quinazoline compound of formula 1.<br>
The present invention relates to constrained thiazolo-, oxazolo-, and imidazolo- pyrimidine compounds and their use in therapy. More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more protein kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
In eukaryotes, all biological functions, including DNA replication, cell cycle progression, energy metabolism, and cell growth and differentiation, are regulated through the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. The phosphorylation state of a protein determines not only its fiinction, subcellular distribution, and stability, but also what other proteins or cellular components it associates with. The balance of specific phosphorylation in the proteonie as a whole, as well as of individual members in a biochemical pathway, is thus used by organisms as a strategy to maintain homeostasis in response to an ever-changing environment. The enzymes that carry out these phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps are protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively.<br>
The eukaryotic protein kinase family is one of the largest in the human genome, comprising some 500 genes [1,2]. The majority of kinases contain a 250-300 amino acid residue catalytic domain with a conserved core structure. This domain comprises a binding pocket for ATP (less frequently GTP), whose terminal phosphate group the kinase transfers covalently to its macromolecular substrates. The phosphate donor is always bound as a complex with a divalent ion (usually Mg2+ or Mn2+). Another important function of the catalytic domain is the binding and orientation for phosphotransfer of the macromolecular substrate. The catalytic domains present in most kinases are more or less homologous.<br>
A wide variety of molecules capable of inhibiting protein kinase function through antagonising ATP binding are known in the art [3-7]. By way of example, the applicant has previously disclosed 2-anilino-4-he£eroaryl-pyrirnidine compounds with kinase inhibitory<br><br><br><br>
properties, particularly against cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [8-12]. CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that associate with various cyclin subunits. These complexes are important for the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle progression, but also for the regulation of transcription [13,14].<br>
The present invention seeks to provide new so-called "constrained" heteroaryl-substituted pyrimidine derivatives, in which free rotation of the heteroaryl substituent is hindered. More specifically, the invention relates to 4,5-dihydro-thiazolo-, oxazolo-, and imidazolo-[4,5-/r]quinazolin-8-ylamines that have broad therapeutic applications in the treatment of a number of different diseases and/or that are capable of inhibiting one or more protein kinases.<br>

THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
The compounds of formula 1 have been found to possess anti-proliferative activity and are therefore believed to be of use in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancers, leukaemias and other disorders associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and restenosis. As defined herein, an anti-proliferative effect within the scope of the present invention may be demonstrated by the ability to inhibit cell proliferation in an in vitro whole cell assay, for example using any of the cell lines A549, HT29 or Saos-2<br>
Using such assays it may be determined whether a compound is anti-proliferative in the<br>
context of the present invention.<br>
On preferred embodiment of the present invention therefore relates to the use of one or more compounds of formula 1 in the preparation of a medicament for treating a proliferative disorder.<br>
As used herein the phrase "preparation of a medicament" includes the use of a compound of formula 1 directly as the medicament in addition to its use in a screening programme for further therapeutic agents or in any stage of the manufacture of such a medicament.<br>
Preferably, the proliferative disorder is a cancer or leukaemia. The term proliferative disorder is used herein in a broad sense to include any disorder that requires control of the cell cycle, for example cardiovascular disorders such as restenosis, cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction, auto-irnmune disorders such as glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis, dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antiparasitic disorders such as malaria, emphysema, alopecia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. In these disorders, the compounds of the present invention may induce apoptosis or maintain stasis within the desired cells as required.<br>
The compounds of the invention may inhibit any of the steps or stages in the cell cycle, for example, formation of the nuclear envelope, exit from the quiescent phase of the cell cycle (GO), Gl progression, chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, START, initiation of DNA replication, progression of DNA replication, termination of DNA replication, centrosome duplication, G2 progression, activation of mitotic or meiotic functions, chromosome condensation, centrosome separation, microtubule nucleation, spindle formation and function, interactions with microtubule motor proteins, chromatid separation and segregation, inactivation of mitotic functions, formation of contractile ring, and cytokinesis functions. In particular, the compounds of the invention may influence certain gene functions such as chromatin binding, formation of replication complexes,<br>
replication licensing, phosphorylation or other secondary modification activity, proteolytic<br>
degradation, microtubule binding, actin binding, septin binding, microtubule organising centre nucleation activity and binding to components of cell cycle signalling pathways.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit at least one CDK enzyme.<br>
Preferably, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit at least one of CDK2 and/or CDK4.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula 1 in the preparation of a medicament for treating a viral disorder, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and varicella zoster virus (VZV).<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit one or more of the host cell CDKs involved in viral replication, i.e. CDK2, CDK7, CDKS, and CDK9 [23].<br>
As defined herein, an anti-viral effect within the scope of the present invention may be demonstrated by the ability to inhibit CDK2, CDK7, CDKS or CDK9.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention relates to the use of one or more compounds of formula 1 in the treatment of a viral disorder which is CDK dependent or sensitive, CDK dependent disorders are associated with an above normal level of activity of one or more CDK enzymes. Such disorders preferably associated with an abnormal level of activity of CDK2, CDK7, CDKS and/or CDK9. A CDK sensitive disorder is a disorder in which an aberration in the CDK level is not the primary cause, but is downstream of the primary metabolic aberration. In such scenarios, CDK2, CDK7, CDKS<br>
and/or CDK9 can be said to be part of the sensitive metabolic pathway and CDK inhibitors<br>
may therefore be active in treating such disorders.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of formula 1, or pharmaceutically accetable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating diabetes.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the diabetes is type II diabetes.<br>
GSK3 is one of several protein kinases that phosphorylate glycogen synthase (GS). The stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in skeletal muscle results from the dephosphorylation and activation of GS. GSK3's action on GS thus results in the latter's deactivation and thus suppression of the conversion of glucose into glycogen in muscles.<br>
Type II diabetes (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) is a multi-factorial disease. Hyperglycaemia is due to insulin resistance in the liver, muscles, and other tissues, coupled with impaired secretion of insulin. Skeletal muscle is the main site for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, there it is either removed from circulation or converted to glycogen. Muscle glycogen deposition is the main determinant in glucose homeostasis and type II diabetics have defective muscle glycogen storage. There is evidence that an increase in GSK3 activity is important in type II diabetes [24]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GSK3 is over-expressed in muscle cells of type II diabetics and that an inverse correlation exists between skeletal muscle GSK3 activity and insulin action [25].<br>
GSK3 inhibition is therefore of therapeutic significance in the treatment of diabetes, particularly type II, and diabetic neuropathy.<br>
It is notable that GSK3 is known to phosphorylate many substrates other than GS, and is thus involved in the regulation of multiple biochemical pathways. For example, GSK is highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems.<br>
15 Another aspect of the invention therefore relates to the use of compounds of formula 1, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating a CNS disorders, for example neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
Preferably, the CNS disorder is Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Tau is a GSK-3 substrate which has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. In healthy nerve cells, Tau co-assembles with tubulin into microtubules. However, in Alzheimer's disease, tau forms large tangles of filaments, which disrupt the microtubule structures in the nerve cell, thereby impairing the transport of nutrients as well as the transmission of neuronal messages.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that GSK.3 inhibitors may be able to prevent and/or reverse the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau that is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease and a number of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease. Mutations in the tau gene cause inherited forms of fronto-temporal dementia, further underscoring the relevance of tau protein dysfunction for the neurodegenerative process [26].<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating bipolar disorder.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating a stroke.<br>
Reducing neuronal apoptosis is an important therapeutic goal in the context of head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, and motor neuron disease [27]. Therefore, GSK3 as a pro-<br>
 apoptotic factor in ncuronal cells makes this protein kinase an attractive therapeutic target<br>
for the design of inhibitory drugs to treat these diseases.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating alopecia.<br>
Hair growth is controlled by the Wnt signalling pathway, in particular Wnt-3. In tissue-culture model systems of the skin, the expression of non-degradable mutants of P-catenin leads to a dramatic increase in the population of putative stem cells, which have greater proliferative potential [28]. This population of stem cells expresses a higher level of non-cadherin-associated p-catenin [29], which may contribute to their high proliferative potential. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing a truncated p-catenin in the skin undergo de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, which normally is only established during embryogenesis. The ectopic application of GSK3 inhibitors may therefore be therapeutically useful in the treatment of baldness and in restoring hair growth following chemotherapy-induced alopecia.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a GSK3-dependent disorder, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a compound of formula 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above in an amount sufficient to inhibit GSK3.<br>
Preferably, the compound of formula 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit GSK3/3.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit at least one PLK enzyme.<br>
 The polo-like kinases (PLKs) constitute a family of serine/threonine protein kinases.<br>
Mitotic Drosophila melanogaster mutants at the polo locus display spindle abnormalities [30] and polo was found to encode a mitotic kinase [31]. In humans, there exist three closely related PLKs [32]. They contain a highly homologous amino-terminal catalytic kinase domain and their carboxyl termini contain two or three conserved regions, the polo boxes. The function of the polo boxes remains incompletely understood but they are implicated in the targeting of PLKs to subcellular compartments [33,34], mediation of interactions with other proteins [35], or may constitute part of an autoregulatory domain [36]. Furthermore, the polo box-dependent PLK1 activity is required for proper metaphase/anaphase transition and cytokinesis [37,38].<br>
Studies have shown that human PLKs regulate some fundamental aspects of mitosis [39,40]. In particular, PLK1 activity is believed to be necessary for the functional maturation of centrosomes in late G2/early prophase and subsequent establishment of a bipolar spindle. Depletion of cellular PLK1 through the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique has also confirmed that this protein is required for multiple mitotic processes and completion of cytokinesis [41].<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK1.<br>
Of the three human PLKs, PLK1 is the best characterized; it regulates a number of cell division cycle effects, including the onset of mitosis [42,43], DNA-damage checkpoint activation [44,45], regulation of the anaphase promoting complex [46-48], phosphorylation of the proteasome [49], and centrosome duplication and maturation [50].<br>
Specifically, initiation of mitosis requires activation of M-phase promoting factor (MPF), the complex between the cyclin dependent kinase CDK1 and B-type cyclins [51]. The latter accumulate during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and promote the inhibitory phosphorylation of the MPF complex by WEE1, MEK1, and MYT1 kinases. At the end of<br>
 the G2  phase,  corresponding dephosphorylation by the dual-specificity phosphatase<br>
CDC25C triggers the activation of MPF [52]. In interphase, cyclin B localizes to the cytoplasm [53], it then becomes phosphorylated during prophase and this event causes nuclear translocation [54,55]. The nuclear accumulation of active MPF during prophase is thought to be important for initiating M-phase events [56]. However, nuclear MPF is kept inactive by WEE1 unless counteracted by CDC25C. The phosphatase CDC25C itself, localized to the cytoplasm during interphase, accumulates in the nucleus in prophase [57-59]. The nuclear entry of both cyclin B [60] and CDC25C [61] are promoted through phosphorylation by PLK1 [43]. This kinase is an important regulator of M-phase initiation.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the compounds of formula 1 are ATP-antagonistic inhibitors of PLK.1.<br>
In the present context ATP antagonism refers to the ability of an inhibitor compound to diminish or prevent PLK catalytic activity, i.e. phosphotransfer from ATP to a macromolecular PLK substrate, by virtue of reversibly or irreversibly binding at the enzyme's active site in such a manner as to impair or abolish ATP binding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compound of formula 1 is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK2 and/or PLK3.<br>
Mammalian PLK2 (also known as SNK) and PLK3 (also known as PRK and FNK) were originally shown to be immediate early gene products. PLK3 kinase activity appears to peak during late S and G2 phase. It is also activated during DNA damage checkpoint activation and severe oxidative stress. PLK3 also plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and centrosome function in the cell and deregulated PLK3 expression results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [62]. PLK2 is the least well understood homologue of the three PLKs. Both PLK2 and PLK3 may have additional important post-mitotic functions [35].<br>
 In one preferred embodiment, the compound of formula 1 is capable of inhibiting one or<br>
more of the following protein kinases at sub-micromolar ICso values: CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, glycogen synthase kinase 3, polo-like kinases, aurora kinases.<br>

SALTS/ESTERS<br>
The compounds of formula 1 can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrohalic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic,<br>
glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or<br>
glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (Ci-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
Esters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (Ci-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).<br>
ENANTIOMERS/TAUTOMERS<br>
In all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers and tautomers of compounds of formula 1. The man skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess an optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
STEREO AND GEOMETRIC ISOMERS<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isorners -- e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so<br>
may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms.   The present invention<br>
contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, I7O, I80, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36C1, respectively.    Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., I4C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability.  Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
SOLVATES<br>
The present invention also includes the use of solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these for<br>
POLYMORPHS<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.<br>
PRODRUGS<br>
The invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of formula 1 wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Such reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, nasal, bupcal or sublingual routes of administration.<br>
For oral administration, particular use is made of compressed tablets, pills, tablets, gellules, drops, and capsules. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.<br>
 Other forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected<br>
intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.<br>
An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
Injectable forms may contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.<br>
Compositions may be formulated in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose.<br>
DOSAGE<br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case.<br>
 There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are<br>
merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, one or more doses of 10 to 150 mg/day will be administered to the patient<br>
COMBINATIONS<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other therapeutically active agents, for example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other anticancer agents.<br>
Anticancer drugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance in early tumor cells which would have been otherwise responsive to initial chemotherapy with a single agent. An example of the use of biochemical interactions in selecting drug combinations is demonstrated by the administration of leucovorin to increase the binding of an active intracellular metabolite of 5-fluorouracil to its target, thymidylate synthase, thus increasing its cytotoxic effects.<br>
 Numerous combinations are used in current treatments of cancer and leukemia. A more<br>
extensive review of medical practices may be found in "Oncologic Therapies" edited by E. E. Yokes and H. M. Golomb, published by Springer.<br>
Beneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the growth inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular cancer initially or cell lines derived from that cancer. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the cycle acting agents identified herein.<br>
ASSAYS<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove in an assay for identifying further candidate compounds that influence the activity of one or more protein kinases.<br>
Preferably, the assay is capable of identifying candidate compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more of a CDK enzyme, aurora kinase, GSK or a PLK enzyme.<br>
More preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.<br>
Preferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a compound of the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "conventional SAR modification" refers to standard methods known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located<br>
 intracellularly.   The abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between<br>
the compound and the agent being tested may be measured.<br>
The assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.<br>
This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a compound specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a compound.<br>
Another technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.<br>
It is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.<br>
Preferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the invention with a protein kinase in the presence of a known substrate of said protein kinase and detecting any change in the interaction between said protein kinase and said known substrate.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of detecting the binding of a ligand to,<br>
a kinase, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
