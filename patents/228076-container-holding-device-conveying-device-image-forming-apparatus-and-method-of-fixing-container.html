DESCRIPTION<br>
CONTAINER HOLDING DEVICE, CONVEYING DEVICE,<br>
IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS, AND METHOD OF FIXING<br>
CONTAINER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for holding a<br>
container that stores powder, liquid, gas and the like, conveying the<br>
contents stored in the container holding device to another device.<br>
 BACKGROUND ART<br>
Container holding devices for holding containers, which store<br>
powder, liquid, gas and the like, are used in various fields. For<br>
example, a container holding device is used in image forming<br>
apparatuses for holding a toner container. In case of the image<br>
forming apparatuses, a holding part holds the toner container, and a<br>
toner conveying device supplies the toner to a developing device of the<br>
image forming apparatus.<br>
Toner containers made of hard materials, such as bottles or<br>
cartridges, are known. However, the hard toner containers do not<br>
shrink when the toner is finished.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication Nos.<br>
2001-194907, 2001-324863, and 2002-72649 disclose toner containers<br>
that are bag-shaped, made of soft material, and can be reduced in size<br><br>
2<br>
and volume by a suction pump. These soft toner containers shrink<br>
when the toner is finished. The soft containers are better than the<br>
hard containers in various respects. For example, because the soft<br>
containers shrink, more containers can be accommodated in the same<br>
space, so that the transportation costs of returning used toner<br>
containers to the manufacturer can be reduced.<br>
However, when the soft toner container shrinks, creases are<br>
formed on the container and the toner gets caught in the creases, and<br>
cannot be stably supplied to the toner outlet. One approach is to<br>
provide fold lines on the container, so that the container shrinks in a<br>
fixed shape along the fold lines, and is neatly folded without creases.<br>
However, creases are formed even if fold lines are provided. A<br>
countermeasure is to provide pressurizing guide members (external<br>
pressurizing means) that apply pressure along the fold lines.<br>
However, the pressurizing guide members become obstacles<br>
when replacing an empty toner container with a new container.<br>
Therefore, the user is required to strongly push the new toner container<br>
into its position, against the force of the pressurizing guide members.<br>
However, creases are formed on the toner container when it is strongly<br>
pushed into its position. In addition, if such creases are created, the<br>
container does not fold into a fixed shape along the fold lines, when<br>
shrinking. Also, the toner container is apt to tear when being fixed,<br>
because of the pressurizing guide members. Therefore, a relatively<br>
rigid material has to be used on the container where the fold lines are<br>
provided, however, the rigid material is hard to shrink.<br><br>
3<br>
These problems are not limited to the container holding device<br>
used for the toner conveying device in the image forming apparatus.<br>
Such problems also apply to any other container holding device for<br>
holding a soft container that shrinks as the contents are ejected.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. For the sake of<br>
explanation, the present invention is applied to an image forming<br>
apparatus; moreover, the image forming apparatus is assumed to be a<br>
tandem-type color laser printer (hereinafter, "printer").<br><br>
7<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a printer according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The printer includes four sets of<br>
process units, 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1 K, that form yellow (Y), magenta (M),<br>
cyan (C), and black (K) images, respectively. Hereinafter, a symbol Y,<br>
 M, C or K denoted after a number represents that the corresponding<br>
member is for yellow, magenta, cyan or black. The printer includes an<br>
optical writing unit 10, an intermediate transfer unit 11, a secondary<br>
transfer bias roller 18, a pair of registration rollers 19, a paper feeding<br>
cassette 20, and a belt-type fixing unit 21. The optical writing unit 10<br>
 includes a light source, polygon mirrors, f-0 lenses, reflecting mirrors,<br>
and irradiates a laser beam on the surface of a photosensor based on<br>
image information.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an enlarged view of the process unit 1Y. The<br>
other process units 1M, 1C, and 1K have similar configuration so the<br>
descriptions thereof are omitted to avoid redundant explanation. The<br>
process unit 1Y includes a drum-shaped photosensor 2Y, a charging<br>
device 30Y, a developing device 40Y, a drum cleaning device 48Y, and<br>
a discharging device (not shown).<br>
The charging device 30Y includes a charging roller 31Y that is<br>
applied with alternating voltage. The charging roller 31Y rubs against<br>
the photosensor 2Y, so as to uniformally charge the surface of the<br>
photosensor 2Y in the dark. A laser beam that is modulated and<br>
deflected by the optical writing unit 10, scans and irradiates the surface<br>
of the charged photosensor 2Y. As a result, an electrostatic latent<br>
image is formed on the surface of the photosensor 2Y. The developing<br><br>
8<br>
device 40Y develops the electrostatic latent image to form a Y toner<br>
image.<br>
The developing device 40Y includes a developing roller 42Y that<br>
is housed in a case 41Y. The developing roller 42Y is arranged such<br>
 that a part of the surface of the developing roller 42Y is exposed from<br>
an opening in the case 41Y. The developing device 40Y also includes<br>
a first conveying screw 43Y, a second conveying screw 44Y, a doctor<br>
blade 45Y, and a toner density sensor 46Y housed in the case 41Y.<br>
The case 41Y stores two-component developer (not shown)<br>
 including magnetic carriers and negatively charged Y toner. The first<br>
conveying screw 43Y and the second conveying screw 44Y stir and<br>
convey the two-component developer so as to friction charge the<br>
two-component developer. The charged two-component developer is<br>
then carried on the surface of the developing roller 42Y. The doctor<br>
blade 45Y controls the thickness of the developer before the developer<br>
is conveyed to a developing area facing the photosensor 2Y, where the<br>
Y toner adheres to an electrostatic latent image on the photosensor 2Y.<br>
As a result, the Y toner image is formed on the photosensor 2Y. After<br>
the Y toner is used up for development, the two-component developer is<br>
returned into the case 41Y by the rotation of the developing roller 42Y.<br>
A partition 47Y is provided between the first conveying screw 43Y and<br>
the second conveying screw 44Y. The partition 47Y divides the case<br>
41Y into a first compartment including the developing roller 42Y and the<br>
first conveying screw 43Y, and a second compartment including the<br>
second conveying screw 44Y. The first conveying screw 43Y is rotated<br><br>
9<br>
by a driving unit (not shown) to convey the two-component developer in<br>
the first compartment to the developing roller 42Y. The two-component<br>
developer conveyed to the corner of the first compartment by the first<br>
conveying screw 43Y enters into the second compartment through an<br>
 opening (not shown) in the partition 47Y. The second conveying screw<br>
44Y is rotated by a driving unit (not shown) to convey the<br>
two-component developer, coming from the first compartment, in a<br>
direction opposite to that of the first conveying screw 43Y. The<br>
two-component developer conveyed to the corner of the second<br>
compartment by the second conveying screw 44Y returns to the first<br>
compartment through another opening (not shown) in the partition 47Y.<br>
The toner density sensor 46Y, which can be a permeability<br>
sensor, is situated near the center of the bottom wall of the second<br>
compartment, and outputs a voltage according to the permeability of the<br>
two-component developer passing over the toner density sensor 46Y.<br>
The permeability and the toner density of the two-component developer<br>
are substantially correlated, so the voltage output from the toner density<br>
sensor 46Y is in accordance with the density of the Y toner. A signal<br>
of the voltage is transmitted to a control unit (not shown). The control<br>
unit includes a RAM that stores a Vtref for Y, that is a reference voltage.<br>
The reference voltage is the optimal voltage to be output from the toner<br>
density sensor 46Y. The RAM also stores the Vtref data for M, C, and<br>
K. The Vtref for Y is used to control the operation of a Y toner<br>
conveying device (not shown). Specifically, the control unit controls<br>
the Y toner conveying device to supply an appropriate amount of Y<br><br>
10<br>
toner into the second compartment, so that the voltage output from the<br>
toner density sensor 46Y approaches the Vtref for Y. As a result, the Y<br>
toner density of the two-component developer in the developing device<br>
40Y is maintained within a predetermined range. The toner supply is<br>
controlled in the same manner in the developing devices of the other<br>
process units.<br>
The Y toner image formed on the photosensor 2Y is transferred<br>
onto an intermediate transfer belt (not shown). After the transfer, the<br>
drum cleaning device 48Y cleans off the residual toner on the surface of<br>
the photosensor 2Y, and a discharging lamp discharges and the<br>
photosensor 2Y. Then, the charging device 30Y uniformly charges the<br>
photosensor 2Y to form a next image. The other process units perform<br>
the same process.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the intermediate transfer unit 11 includes<br>
an intermediate transfer belt 12, a driving roller 13, stretching rollers 14<br>
and 15, a belt cleaning device 16, and four intermediate transfer bias<br>
rollers 17Y, 17M, 17C, and 17K. The intermediate transfer belt 12 is<br>
tensely stretched by the driving roller 13, the stretching rollers 14 and<br>
15, and is endlessly revolved in an anti-clockwise direction as viewed in<br>
the figure by the driving roller 13 that is rotated by a driving system (not<br>
shown). Intermediate transfer bias is applied to the intermediate<br>
transfer bias rollers 17Y, 17M, 17C, and 17K from a power source (not<br>
shown). Then, the intermediate transfer bias rollers 17Y, 17M, 17C,<br>
and 17K push the intermediate transfer belt 12 towards the<br>
photosensors 2Y, 2M, 2C, and 2K. As a result, a nip is formed<br><br>
11<br>
between each of the intermediate transfer bias rollers and the<br>
corresponding photosensors. In each of the nips, an electric field is<br>
formed due to the intermediate transfer bias. The Y toner image<br>
formed on the photosensor 2Y is transferred onto the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 12 due to the electric field and the pressure of the nip.<br>
The M, C, and K toner images formed on the photosensors 2M, 2C, and<br>
2K are sequentially superimposed on the Y toner image. As a result, a<br>
four-color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt 12.<br>
The four-color toner image is then transferred onto a transfer paper P,<br>
which is a recording material. The belt cleaning device 16 is located<br>
near the stretching roller 15 in close contact with the intermediate<br>
 transfer bell 12. The belt cleaning device 16 cleans off the toner<br>
remaining on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt 12 after the<br>
transfer.<br>
The paper feeding cassette 20, which stores the transfer paper<br>
P in a stack, is located below the optical writing unit 10. A paper<br>
feeding roller 20a is pushed against the top transfer paper P. When<br>
the paper feeding roller 20a rotates at a predetermined timing, the top<br>
transfer paper P is led into a paper conveying path.<br>
In the intermediate transfer unit 11, the driving roller 13 contacts<br>
the secondary transfer bias roller 18, with the intermediate transfer belt<br>
12 interposed between the two rollers, forming a nip. Secondary<br>
transfer bias is applied to the secondary transfer bias roller 18 from a<br>
power source (not shown).<br>
The transfer paper P fed into the paper conveying path is<br><br>
12<br>
sandwiched between the pair of registration rollers 19. As the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 12 rotates, the four-color toner image formed<br>
on the intermediate transfer belt 12 enters the nip. The pair of<br>
registration rollers 19 sends out the transfer paper P at a timing such<br>
that the transfer paper P comes into contact with the four-color toner<br>
image at the nip. The four-color toner image is then transferred to the<br>
transfer paper P at the nip due to the secondary transfer bias and the<br>
pressure of the nip, forming a full-color image on the transfer paper P.<br>
The transfer paper P with the full-color image is conveyed to the fixing<br>
unit 21.<br>
The fixing unit 21 includes a belt unit 21b, in which a fixing belt<br>
21a is stretched by three rollers and is endlessly revolved, and a<br>
heating roller 21c having a heat source inside. The transfer paper P is<br>
conveyed in between the belt unit 21b and the heating roller 21c, so<br>
that the full-color image is fixed on the surface of the transfer paper P.<br>
A pair of paper discharge rollers 22 leads the transfer paper P outside<br>
the printer.<br>
As described above, the printer includes a visible image forming<br>
unit that forms a visible image onto a recording material, by using the<br>
process units 1Y, 1M, 1C, 1K, the intermediate transfer unit 11, and so<br>
forth.<br>
Next, toner containers 50Y, 50M, 50C, 50K containing toner of Y,<br>
M, C, K, respectively, are described.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the toner container 50Y. The<br>
toner container 50Y includes a bag part 51Y that is bag-shaped, made<br><br>
13<br>
of soft material, a mouth part 52Y that is a cap member, and a rod 53Y.<br>
The bag part 51Y is square-shaped, made of a single sheet or layers of<br>
sheets, and has a thickness of from 50 micrometers (urn) to 210 urn,<br>
and it is shrinkable. The bag part 51Y contains Y toner. The sheet<br>
can be made of a resin material including polyester, polyethylene, and<br>
nylon, or it can be made of paper. In the present embodiment, the bag<br>
part 51Y has two layers: a polyethylene sheet on the inside, that welds<br>
to the mouth part 52Y; and a nylon sheet on the outside. The bag part<br>
51Y also has reinforcing layers 80, made of a material including<br>
polyethylene terephthalate and aluminum, provided on two opposing<br>
sides.<br>
Fold lines f are provided on the bag part 51Y on the sides where<br>
the reinforcing layers 80 are not provided. When the bag part 51Y<br>
shrinks, the surfaces provided with the reinforcing layers 80 are<br>
maintained in a flat state due to the strength of the reinforcing layers 80,<br>
without forming any creases. Therefore, the fold lines f do not deform<br>
and remain straight. As a result, the bag part 51Y gets neatly folded<br>
along the fold lines f when shrinking.<br>
There are eight holes 80h on each of the reinforcing layers 80.<br>
A user can hook his fingers into these holes 80h, so that it becomes<br>
easy when holding the toner container 50Y to shake it, or when fixing it<br>
into a container holder. These holes 80h also function as reference<br>
marks that indicate appropriate positions where to place the user's<br>
fingers. This prevents the user from holding the bag part 51Y in such<br>
a way that the fold lines f deform, so that the bag part 51Y shrinks in a<br><br>
14<br>
fixed shape.<br>
The upper half of the bag part 51Y is a substantially rectangular<br>
solid shape when inflated, and the bottom half is an inverse<br>
quadrangular pyramid (in a taper form), forming a hopper that pours the<br>
toner downwards to the mouth part 52Y. The mouth part 52Y is made<br>
of a rigid material including resin, and is weld to the tip of the hopper.<br>
The toner container 50Y is positioned such that the mouth part 52Y is at<br>
the bottom, and the bag part 51Y is connected to the mouth part 52Y.<br>
A through hole 54Y is formed in the mouth part 52Y. When the rod 53Y<br>
is inserted into this through hole 54Y, the Y toner (not shown) in the<br>
toner container 50Y does not ooze out. The other toner containers<br>
50M, 50C, and 50K have a configuration that is similar to that of the<br>
toner container 50Y, so the descriptions thereof are omitted.<br>
Next, a configuration and operation of the toner conveying<br>
device that conveys the toner to the developing device is described<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram of the toner conveying device Y and a part of<br>
the developing device for the Y toner. The toner conveying device<br>
includes a conveying tube 70Y, a nozzle 71Y that forms a toner<br>
conveying path, and a suction pump 90Y. The container holder (not<br>
shown) holds the toner container 50Y. The toner container 50Y is fixed<br>
into the container holder such that the mouth part 52Y is positioned at<br>
the bottom. The toner container 50Y is replaced with a new toner<br>
container when the toner is substantially finished. The nozzle 71Y is<br>
inserted into the through hole 54Y of the mouth part 52Y of the new<br><br>
15<br>
toner container 50Y, pushing out the rod 53Y from the through hole 54Y.<br>
As a result, the nozzle 71Y is connected to the mouth part 52Y and the<br>
toner conveying path is formed. The Y toner ejected from the toner<br>
container 50Y is conveyed to the developing device 40Y through the<br>
toner conveying path.<br>
The other end of the nozzle 71Y is connected to the conveying<br>
tube 70Y. The conveying tube 70Y is made of a flexible material such<br>
as rubber or resin that has excellent toner resistance, and has an<br>
internal diameter of 4 millimeters (mm) to 10 mm. The other end of the<br>
conveying tube 70Y is connected to a pump part 91Y included in the<br>
suction pump 90Y. The suction pump 90Y is a so-called uniaxial<br>
eccentric screw pump, which includes the pump part 91Y, a discharge<br>
part 95Y in connection with the pump part 91Y, an axial member 96Y, a<br>
universal joint 97Y, and a suction motor 98Y<br>
The pump part 91Y includes a rotor 92Y in a shape of an<br>
eccentric double-thread screw, made of metal or highly rigid resin, a<br>
stator 93Y that is hollow inside in the shape of a double-thread screw<br>
and made of rubber, and an inhalator 94Y. When the suction motor<br>
98Y rotates, the rotational drive is transmitted to the rotor 92Y via the<br>
universal joint 97Y and the axial member 96Y. As a result, the rotor<br>
92Y rotates inside the stator 93Y, and then negative pressure is<br>
generated at the inhalator 94Y. Due to the negative pressure, the Y<br>
toner in the bag part 51Y is sucked into the suction pump 90Y through<br>
the mouth part 52Y, the nozzle 71Y, and the conveying tube 70Y, and is<br>
then discharged into the discharge part 95Y through the stator 93Y.<br><br>
16<br>
The discharge part 95Y is connected to the second compartment of the<br>
developing device 40Y, and the Y toner is supplied to the second<br>
compartment to be mixed with the two-component developer (not<br>
shown).<br>
The toner container 50Y does not require any movable members<br>
such as an auger to convey the Y toner, because the suction pump 90Y<br>
conveys the Y toner. Accordingly, the toner container 50Y can be<br>
simple in structure and light-weight. In addition, the suction pump 90Y<br>
shrinks the bag part 51Y, reducing the volume of the toner container<br>
50Y. As a result, transportation costs can be reduced when returning<br>
the used toner containers 50Y to the manufacturer for recycling<br>
purposes. Also the conveyjngtube does not require any screws, etc.,<br>
to convey the toner, so the conveying tube 70Y can bend flexibly.<br>
Moreover, the toner container 50Y does not necessarily need to be<br>
located below the developing device 40Y, because the suction pump<br>
90Y can pump up and convey the toner, regardless of gravity. As a<br>
result, the toner conveying path can be laid out anywhere in the printer,<br>
which is advantageous in various respects.<br>
Because the fold lines f are provided on the bag part 51Y, the<br>
bag part 51Y shrinks along the fold lines f due to the suction, and folds<br>
into a substantially flat shape as illustrated in Fig. 5. Hence, the<br>
transportation costs of the used containers can be further reduced.<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view of an example of a configuration of a<br>
mouth part of the toner container 50Y, in a disassembled state. The<br>
mouth part 52Y includes a main part 55Y with a large vertical hole and<br><br>
17<br>
a horizontal through hole 54Y, and a welding part 56Y that protrudes<br>
above the main part. There is also a cap part 57Y that fits into the<br>
vertical hole of the main part 55Y from below. The welding part 56Y is<br>
welded to the opening of the bag part 51Y and fixes the mouth part 52Y<br>
to the bottom of the bag part. The cap part 57Y also has the through<br>
hole 54Y. Accordingly, when the cap part 57Y is fitted into the main<br>
part 55Y, the through hole 54Y penetrates both the main part 55Y and<br>
the cap part 57Y in a horizontal direction. Ring-shaped seals 58Y<br>
made of an elastic material such as rubber, are provided around the<br>
through hole 54Y of the cap part 57Y. Thus, when the rod 53Y or the<br>
nozzle 71Y is inserted into the through hole 54Y, the inside of the cap<br>
part 57Y is sealed off from outside\.<br>
The mouth part 52Y is divided into the main part 55Y and the<br>
cap part 57Y so that the Y toner can be easily supplied into the bag part<br>
51Y. If the main part 55Y and the cap part 57Y were combined as one<br>
unit, the Y toner has to be supplied from the small through hole 54Y,<br>
which is positioned at 90 degrees with respect to the toner path from<br>
the bag part 51Y. On the other hand, if the main part 55Y and the cap<br>
part 57Y are separable, the Y toner can be supplied straightly into the<br>
bag part 51Y from the large opening of the mouth part 52Y. This can<br>
prevent the toner from soiling the seals 58Y. Meanwhile, the diameter<br>
of the rod 53Y is to be small enough so that the user's finger does not<br>
accidentally push the rod 53Y out of the through hole 54Y. The<br>
cross-sectional area of the rod 53Y is to be 8 mm2 or less, preferably 6<br>
mm2 or less.<br><br>
18<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view of another example of a<br>
configuration of the mouth part of the toner container 50Y, in a<br>
disassembled state. The mouth part 52Y includes a welding part 156Y<br>
and a main part 155Y that fits into the welding part 156Y. There is also<br>
included a cap part 157Y that fits into a vertical hole of the main part<br>
155Y from above. The welding part 156Y is welded to the opening of<br>
the bag part 51Y The cap part 157 fits into the vertical hole of the<br>
main part 155, and the main part connects to the welding part 156Y, so<br>
that the mouth part 52Y is fixed to the bottom of the bag part. A<br>
ring-shaped seal 58Y is provided between the cap part 157Y and the<br>
welding part 156Y. In a normal environment, the seal is not required.<br>
However, in an environment of reduced pressure (in a high-altitude<br>
environment), the air leaks out of the bag part 51Y, and packing occurs<br>
in the toner when returned to a normal environment. In order to<br>
prevent this, the seals 58Y are provided.<br>
Also, in the mouth part 52Y, a circuit board 159Y is provided in<br>
the main part 155Y. The circuit board 159Y includes an electric circuit<br>
and a memory to confirm whether the toner container 50Y is attached,<br>
and the remaining amount of toner. When the toner container 50Y is<br>
attached to the main part 155Y, a contact terminal of the circuit board<br>
159Y and a contact terminal of the main part 155Y contact each other.<br>
The toner container 50Y and the main part 155Y exchange information<br>
by the contact terminals.<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view of the printer.<br>
There are four container holders 75Y, 75M, 75C, and 75K,<br><br>
19<br>
functioning as container holding devices, located on the front side of the<br>
printer. The container holders open and close, by pivoting on a<br>
rotational shaft (not shown). Each container holder constitutes part of<br>
the toner conveying device, and holds the toner container of the<br>
corresponding color. The user unlocks a lock (not shown) when setting<br>
the toner container 50Y into the container holder 75Y, so that the<br>
container holder 75Y opens towards the front. The user holds the bag<br>
part 51Y with both hands such that the mouth part 52Y is at the bottom<br>
in a vertical direction, and inserts the toner container 50Y into the<br>
container holder 75Y.<br>
Fig. 9 is a perspective view of the container holder 75 of the<br>
toner conveying device for Y. The toner conveying devices for the<br>
other colors have similar configurations. The symbol for representing<br>
the color is omitted in the following description, for the sake of<br>
simplicity.<br>
The toner conveying device includes a fixing member 76 that<br>
fixes the container holder 75 to the printer. A container guide member<br>
60, functioning as a container holding member, is arranged at the<br>
bottom of the container holder 75. A rotational shaft 75a, located at<br>
the bottom of the container guide member 60, is fixed in the fixing<br>
member 76. The container holder 75 pivots on the rotational shaft 75a.<br>
A protrusion 75b is provided on the upper part of two opposing sides of<br>
the container guide member 60. The protrusion 75b is slidably<br>
connected to a slide member 72, which is rotatably attached to the<br>
printer. Therefore, the angle at which the container holder 75 opens is<br><br>
20<br>
restricted by the slide members 72. The container holder 75 is<br>
capable of moving between an open position at which a toner container<br>
50 is attached to or detached from the container guide member 60, and<br>
a closed position at which the toner container 50 is fixed into the<br>
 container holder 75.<br>
The container holder 75 is also provided with a back support<br>
part 75d that supports the toner container 50 on the back side facing<br>
the printer. The bottom edge of the back support part 75d is rotatably<br>
fixed to the container holder 75. When the container holder 75 is open,<br>
the back support part 75d leans towards the front by its own weight,<br>
coming in contact with the container guide member 60. However, the<br>
back support part 75d can also movetowards the printer. Therefore,<br>
even if the bottom part of a bag part 51 is inflated due to the toner, the<br>
toner container 50 can smoothly enter the container holder 75. When<br>
the container holder 75 is closed, the back support part 75d is<br>
sandwiched between the toner container 50 and the printer.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 are cross-sectional views of the toner conveying<br>
device for Y, as if cut perpendicularly along the though hole of a mouth<br>
part 52, when the container holder 75 is open and closed, respectively.<br>
The toner conveying device includes a movable plate 73<br>
functioning as a cap holding member. The movable plate 73 is<br>
rotatably attached to the container holder 75 by a rotational shaft 73a,<br>
which is fixed to the bottom of the container holder 75. The movable<br>
plate 73 moves between a withdrawn position of Fig. 10 and a holding<br>
position of Fig. 11. A cam 74 is situated at the bottom part of the<br><br>
21<br>
movable plate 73, on the side not facing the toner container 50. The<br>
cam 74 includes a cam shaft 74a that is rotatably attached to the<br>
container holder 75. The cam 74 is rotated by a cam driving gear 74b<br>
(not shown) provided on the cam shaft 74a. The rotation of the cam 74<br>
causes the movable plate 73 to move between the withdrawn and<br>
holding positions on the rotational shaft 73a. The cam 74, the cam<br>
shaft 74a, and the cam driving gear 74b function as a positioning<br>
means.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate a driving mechanism that rotates the<br>
cam 74, when the container holder 75 is open and closed, respectively.<br>
The container holder 75 and the movable plate 73 are indicated by<br>
chain double-dashed lines, and the fixing member 76 by chain-dashed<br>
lines.<br>
The cam driving gear 74b is in meshing engagement with a gear<br>
part 77a of a substantially L-shaped sector gear 77. The end of the<br>
sector gear 77 is rotatably attached to a rotational shaft 77b that is fixed<br>
to the container holder 75. There is an oblong hole in the middle of the<br>
sector gear 77, through which a fixing shaft 76b, fixed to the fixing<br>
member 76, is inserted.<br>
As the user closes the container holder 75, the rotational shaft<br>
77b moves, and the sector gear 77 rotates in a clockwise direction<br>
around the fixing shaft 76b. The resulting rotational force is<br>
transmitted to the cam driving gear 74b via the gear part 77a. The<br>
cam driving gear 74b then rotates half a turn in an anti-clockwise<br>
direction. A sufficient rotational angle is required to rotate the cam<br><br>
22<br>
driving gear 74b by half a turn, even if the container holder 75 opens by<br>
a small angle.. With the above-described link mechanism, the sector<br>
gear 77 rotates by a large angle, and the gear ratio of the gear part 77a<br>
and the cam driving gear 74b is adjusted. The container holder 75<br>
opens only by 23 degrees at maximum, however, the rotational angle of<br>
the cam 74 is 168 degrees. When the container holder 75 is closed,<br>
the cam 74 rotates, moving the movable plate 73 towards the toner<br>
container 50 into the holding position. In the holding position, the<br>
movable plate 73 holds the mouth part 52 in connection with the nozzle<br>
71.<br>
Conversely, when the container holder 75 is opened, the above<br>
mechanism is performed in reverse. The surface of the cam is<br>
separated from the movable plate 73, and the movable plate 73 is<br>
released from the holding position. As a result, the movable plate 73<br>
can freely rotate on the rotational shaft 73a, and returns to the<br>
withdrawn position. A spring or the like can be employed to force the<br>
movable plate 73 to the withdrawn position.<br>
The toner container 50 can smoothly enter the container holder<br>
.75 when the movable plate 73 is in the withdrawn position. If the<br>
movable plate 73 is in the holding position, the movable plate 73 or the<br>
inner walls of the container holder 75 are apt to block the mouth part 52.<br>
Hence, the mouth part 52 cannot be inserted into the full depth of the<br>
container holder 75 to connect with the nozzle 71. For this reason, the<br>
movable plate 73 is configured to move to the withdrawn position as the<br>
mouth part 52 enters the container holder 75 and contacts the movable<br><br>
23<br>
plate 73. As a result, a larger space is provided to allow the mouth<br>
part 52 to smoothly reach the deepest part of the container holder 75,<br>
even if the mouth part 52 is not inserted straightly.<br>
When the user closes the container holder 75 after the toner<br>
container 50 is properly set, the movable plate 73 moves to the holding<br>
position, so that the mouth part is connected to the nozzle 71.<br>
When the mouth part 52 is inserted, the bag part 51 is more apt<br>
to fold upwards on the surface without the fold line f, compared to that<br>
with the fold line f. For this reason, the movable plate 73 is arranged<br>
so as to face the surface of the bag part 51 without the fold line f, to<br>
facilitate the smooth insertion of the mouth part 52.<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate a nozzle driving mechanism, when the<br>
container holder 75 is open and closed, respectively.<br>
In the toner conveying device, one end of the nozzle 71 is<br>
attached to the bottom of the container holder 75, and the other end is<br>
connected to the conveying tube 70. The nozzle 71 is fixed to a nozzle<br>
holding member 78. The nozzle holding member 78 has two<br>
protruding parts 78a that protrude in a longitudinal direction parallel to<br>
the nozzle 71. As the nozzle 71 is inserted in the mouth part 52, the<br>
protruding parts 78a fit into notches of the mouth part 52. There are<br>
two protrusions 78b that rotatably attach two nozzle driving members 79<br>
on two opposing sides of the nozzle holding member 78. The nozzle<br>
driving members 79 are located on the inside of the sector gear 77, and<br>
move together with the sector gear 77. The nozzle driving members<br>
79 are connected by the rotational shaft 77b that is rotatably attached to<br><br>
24<br>
the sector gear 77. When the user closes the container holder 75, the<br>
rotational shaft 77b is pushed away from the bag part 51. As a result,<br>
the nozzle driving members 79 rotate in a clockwise direction around<br>
the fixing shaft 76b. The resulting rotational force causes the nozzle<br>
holding member 78 to slide towards the mouth part 52 on a guide rail 84.<br>
The protruding parts 78a fit into the notches of the mouth part 52, and<br>
the nozzle 71 enters a through hole 54 of the mouth part 52. On the<br>
other hand, when the user opens the container holder 75, the above<br>
mechanism is performed in reverse. The nozzle holding member 78<br>
slides away from the mouth part 52, pulling the nozzle 71 out of the<br>
through hole 54, allowing the toner container 50 to be removed.<br>
Figs. 16 and 17 are a perspective view and a front view of<br>
relevant parts of an external pressurizing unit 61, respectively, when the<br>
container holder 75 is open. Inner surfaces 60a of the container guide<br>
member 60 form a taper that fits around the toner container 50 near the<br>
mouth part 52Y. Therefore, the toner container 50 can be easily<br>
accommodated. There are two external pressurizing units 61 provided<br>
on two opposing sides of the container guide member 60. The external<br>
pressurizing unit 61 includes a contact member 65, a torsion spring 64<br>
that presses the contact member 65 against the fold line f of the toner<br>
container 50 (not shown), an arm part 76a, and a stud 63.<br>
The external pressurizing unit 61 is positioned near the middle<br>
of the side of the container guide member 60. The contact member 65<br>
contacts the fold line f of the bag part 51, at least where the upper half<br>
and the bottom half of the bag part 51 meet. The bottom end of the<br><br>
25<br>
contact member 65 is rotatably attached to an inner part 60c of the<br>
container guide member 60 by a turn down screw 62. The contact<br>
member 65 is plate-shaped, made of a resin material. A protruding<br>
part 65a is located near the middle of the contact member 65,<br>
protruding outside of the container guide member 60. There is an<br>
oblong hole 65b in the protruding part 65a, through which one end 64a<br>
of the torsion spring 64 is inserted. The torsion spring 64 is rotatably<br>
attached to the stud 63. When the container holder 75 is closed, the<br>
other end 64b of the torsion spring 64 contacts the arm part 76a that<br>
extends from the fixing member 76. As a result, a supporting<br>
mechanism that supports the contact member 65 is formed. The edge<br>
of the arm part 76a bends outside, forming a tapering surface, so that<br>
the end 64b of the torsion spring 64 is easily guided to the arm part<br>
76a.<br>
When the container holder 75 is opened (as shown in Fig. 8),<br>
the end 64b of the torsion spring 64 is detached from the arm part 76a,<br>
and the supporting mechanism releases the contact member 65. As a<br>
result, the contact member 65 moves to a withdrawn position where it<br>
does not block the toner container 50, leaning towards the inner surface<br>
of the container guide member 60 by its own weight. This allows the<br>
toner container 50 to smoothly be attached to or detached from the<br>
container holder 75. The contact member 65 is configured to lean<br>
towards the withdrawn position by its own weight, by making the end<br>
64a of the torsion spring 64 contact the lower part of the oblong hole<br>
65b. Also, as illustrated in Fig. 9, a cutout part 60d is provided on both<br><br>
26<br>
sides of the container guide member 60, so that a top part 65c of the<br>
contact member 65 protrudes outside when the contact member 65 is at<br>
the withdrawn position.<br>
When a user opens the container holder 75, the contact<br>
members 65 move to the withdrawn positions, where they do not<br>
obstruct the process of replacing a used toner container 50 with a new<br>
one. Hence, the user is not required to strongly push in the toner<br>
container 50, as the toner container 50 smoothly enters the container<br>
holder 75 by its own weight. Moreover, the user can insert the toner<br>
container 50 without fear of being torn or damaged by the contact<br>
members 65. Therefore, the toner container 50 can be made of a soft<br>
material, which folds and shrinks easily.<br>
When the user closes the container holder 75 after setting the<br>
toner container 50, the end 64b of the torsion spring 64 attached to the<br>
stud 63 comes into contact with the edge of the arm part 76a. With the<br>
movement of the container holder 75, the end 64b is guided along the<br>
tapering surface of the arm part 76a, and is gradually pushed towards<br>
the container guide member 60. Therefore, the user can push in the<br>
container holder 75 without feeling a strong resistance. As the end<br>
64b of the torsion spring 64 is gradually pushed, the torsion spring 64<br>
rotates. With this rotation, the other end 64a of the torsion spring 64<br>
inserted in the oblong hole 65b gradually generates a force to push the<br>
contact member 65 towards the toner container 50. At this point, the<br>
bag part 51 is filled up with toner and inflated, so the contact member<br>
65 cannot push further into the bag part 51. Therefore, the pressure<br><br>
27<br>
applied to the contact member 65 is absorbed by the torsion spring 64.<br>
As a result, the contact member 65 strongly pushes against the fold line<br>
f.<br>
As the torsion spring 64 is separable from the contact member<br>
65 and the arm part 76a, the level of pressure can be easily adjusted,<br>
simply by exchanging the torsion spring 64. This increases the<br>
freedom in designing the container holder.<br>
As the toner is consumed and the bag part 51 shrinks due to<br>
suction, the contact members 65 gradually move toward the toner<br>
container 50, as shown in Fig. 18. Thus, the bag part 51 neatly folds<br>
along the fold lines f without forming any creases. Because the toner<br>
does not get caught in any creases,eve n toner of low fluidity can be<br>
stably discharged, and the toner can be completely consumed. The<br>
bag part 51 is in a taper form, decreasing in diameter towards the<br>
mouth part 52, so that the toner smoothly moves downwards to the<br>
mouth part 52. Hence, the amount of the bag part 51 to be folded<br>
inside increases towards the direction opposite to the mouth part 52.<br>
For this reason, the contact members 65 are rotatably fixed to the<br>
bottom of the container guide member 60, where the mouth part 52 is<br>
inserted. As a result, the contact members 65 move to a greater<br>
extent towards the direction opposite to the mouth part 52, so that the<br>
bag part 51 is thoroughly folded.<br>
The contact members 65 do not have to contact the fold lines f<br>
entirely. If the contact members 65 contact the fold lines f at least<br>
where the upper half and the bottom half of the bag part 51 meet, the<br><br>
29<br>
bottom part of the external pressurizing member 161 is rotatably<br>
attached to the inner-front part of the container guide member 60 (not<br>
shown) by a turn down screw 162. The external pressurizing member<br>
161 is bent outwards at the middle, forming the pressing part 161a.<br>
The outer edge of the pressing part 161a bends towards the fixing<br>
member 76, forming the arm contact part 161 d. The bag contact part<br>
161c is located at the upper part of the external pressurizing member<br>
161.<br>
When the container holder 75 is open, the arm contact part 161 d<br>
is detached from the arm part 76a, so that the external pressurizing<br>
member 161 is not supported by the arm part 76a. As a result, the bag<br>
contact part 161 c leans towards the side of the container guide member<br>
60 to a withdrawn position, by the weight of the pressing part 161a and<br>
the arm contact part 161d. Therefore, a used toner container 50 can<br>
be smoothly replaced with a new one without being obstructed by the<br>
bag contact part 161c. When the new toner container 50 is fixed, and<br>
the user closes the container holder 75, the arm contact part 161 d<br>
comes in contact with the arm part 76a. As the arm part 76a is a<br>
tapering surface, the arm contact part 161d is gradually pushed towards<br>
the container guide member 60, as the user pushes the container<br>
holder 75. Then, the bag contact part 161c gradually pushes against<br>
the fold line f of the bag part 51. At this point, the bag part 51 is filled<br>
up with toner and inflated, so the bag contact part 161c cannot push<br>
further into the bag part 51. Therefore, the pressure applied to the bag<br>
contact part 161c is absorbed by the pressing part 161a. As a result, a<br><br>
30<br>
gap a in the pressing part 161a opens wider to the gap a', as illustrated<br>
in Figs. 22 and 23.<br>
When the container holder 75 is closed, the contact the bag<br>
contact parts 161c push against the fold lines f, so that the bag part 51<br>
folds along the fold lines f. As the toner is consumed and the bag part<br>
51 shrinks, the bag contact parts 161c cause the bag part 51 to neatly<br>
fold along the fold lines f without forming any creases. The bag<br>
contact parts 161c are rotatably fixed to the bottom of the container<br>
guide member 60. Hence, the bag contact parts 161c move to a<br>
greater extent towards the direction opposite to the mouth part 52, in<br>
proportion to the amount of the bag part 51 to be folded inside, so that<br>
thebag part 51 is thoroughly folded.<br>
The conveying device in the present embodiment conveys toner,<br>
however, the same effects can be achieved with any other powder,<br>
liquid, or gas.<br>
According to the present invention, the external pressurizing unit<br>
61 applies a lower pressure to both sides of the bag part 51 when the<br>
container guide member 60 is at the open position (a first position) than<br>
when the container guide member 60 is at the closed position (a second<br>
position). Thus, the user can attach the toner container 50 into the<br>
container guide member 60 without strongly pushing the toner container<br>
50, so that the toner container 50 is not crushed.<br>
Moreover, as the pressure is automatically released from the<br>
bag part 51 as the user opens the container holder 75, an additional<br>
operation to release the pressure is not required. Because the<br><br>
31<br>
pressure is released, the toner container 50 is not obstructed or torn<br>
when being replaced. Therefore, the bag part 51 can be made of a<br>
soft material that gets neatly folded without forming creases. This<br>
allows the toner, or any other content, to be stably discharged and<br>
conveyed to another device, without getting caught in creases.<br>
Furthermore, the toner container 50 shrinks into a small, fixed<br>
shape along the fold lines f, reducing transportation costs when the<br>
used toner containers 50 are returned to the manufacturer for recycling<br>
purposes.<br>
The contact members 65 that apply the pressure are configured<br>
to move aside to the withdrawn positions by their own weight.<br>
Therefore, the external -pressurizing unit 61 has a simple structure<br>
without requiring additional pressurizing or driving devices, which<br>
reduces production costs and the incidence of failure.<br>
