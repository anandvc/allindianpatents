				<td>FREQUENCY OFFSET ESTIMATING METHOD AND FREQUENCY OFFSET CORRECTING APPARATUS UTILIZING SAID METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the frequency offset estimating technology, and it particularly relates to a frequency offset estimating method for estimating frequency offsets contained in signals received by a plurality of antennas and a frequency offset correcting apparatus utilizing said method. <br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In wireless communication, it is generally desired that the limited frequency resources be used effectively. One of the technologies that effectively utilize the frequency resources is adaptive array antenna technology. In the adaptive array antenna technology, the amplitude and phase of signals transmitted from and received by a plurality of antennas, respectively, are so controlled as to form a directional pattern of the antenna.  In other words, the apparatuses provided with adaptive array antennas change respectively the amplitude and phase of signals received by the plurality of antennas, sum up respectively a plurality of the thus changed received signals, and receive the<br><br>
signals equivalent to the signals received by the antenna 'having the directional pattern corresponding to the variation in said amplitude and phase (hereinafter referred to as "weight").  In addition, signals are transmitted in a directional pattern of the antenna corresponding to the weight.<br>
One example of processings to compute the weights in adaptive array antenna technology is a processing based on the MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) method.  In the MMSE method, the Wiener solution,.is known to be the condition for an optimum weight value. Also known is a recurrence formula whose amount of calculation is smaller than directly solving the Wiener solution.  For such recurrence formula, adaptive algorithms, such as RLS (Recursive Least Squares) algorithm and LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm, are used.<br>
However, frequency offsets are present between carriers outputted from a local oscillator included in a transmitting apparatus and those outputted from a local oscillator included in a receiving apparatus, thus causing to generate phase errors. When QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) is used as a frequency modulation scheme, the constellation of signals received by the receiving apparatus is rotated by phase error.  In general, the rotation of constellation like this degrades the transmission quality of signals, (when an adaptive algorithm is used in adaptive array antenna technique, there are some cases where the<br>
frequency offsets can be estimated in a form such that the frequency offsets are contained in the weight  See Reference (1) in the following Related Art List, for instance). Related Art List (1) Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heil0-210099.<br>
When the weight is to be calculated by using LMS algorithm as the adaptive algorithm, the frequency offsets can be also calculated in a form such that the frequency offsets are contained in the weight.  However, the range in which the frequency offset can be calculated will be narrow in general.  That is, the larger the frequency offset becomes, the harder the accurate estimation of said frequency offset will be.  In addition, if the number o_f_ weights, namely, the number of antennas increases, the range in which the frequency offset can be calculated will be further narrowed. As one method, on the other hand, for broadening the range in which the frequency offset can be calculated using LMS algorithm, the method may be such that the step-size parameter of LMS algorithm is made small. According to this method, the filtering effect is small in general, thus resulting in the drop of signal transmission quality. When the multi-carrier scheme is used to transmit signals, the frequency offset gives rise to intercarrier interference, thus resulting in the further drop of signal transmission quality.<br>

The transmitter 44 includes an amplification unit 54, a frequency conversion unit 56, a quadrature modulation unit 58 and a D-A conversion unit 60.<br>
/The switching unit 40 switches input and output of signals to the receiver 42 and the transmitter 44 according to radio-unit control signals 318 from the control unit 24, which is not shown in FIG. 3, , That- is, the switching unit ,' 40 selects the signals from the transmitter 44 at the time of transmission whereas it selects the signals to the receiver 42 at the time of receiving.<br>

-The frequency offset correcting unit 110 inputs the "digital received signals 300, corrects frequency offsets thereof and then outputs those signals, whose frequency offsets have been corrected, as corrected received signals 326.  Though details will be described later, in a preamble period the frequency offset correcting unit 110 estimates frequency offsets (hereinafter referred to as "initial frequency offsets"), corrects the digital received signals 300 with the thus estimated initial frequency offsets and also corrects them with the residual frequency jsignals 324 described later.,<br>
Using LMS algorithm, the receiving weight vector<br><br>
computing unit 68 computes receiving weight vector signals 312 necessary for weighting the corrected digital received signals 326 from the corrected digital received signals 326, synthesized signal 304 and weight reference signal 306. The receiving weight vector computing unit 68 also estimates frequency offsets contained in the corrected received signals 326 (hereinafter referred to as "residual frequency offsets") based on error vectors derived by LMS algorithm or the receiving weight vector signals 312, and outputs the thus estimated frequency offsets as the residual frequency signals 324.<br>
The multipliers 62 weight the corrected received signals 326 with the receiving weight vector signals 312. The adder 64 sums up the outputs of the multipliers 62 so as to output the synthesized signal 304.<br>
During a training period, the reference signal generator 70 outputs a training signal stored in advance as a weight reference signal 306 and a response reference signal 320. After the training period, the synthesized signal 304 is compared to a predefined threshold value and then the result of comparison is outputted as a weight reference signal 306 and a response reference signal 320. The decision may not necessarily be a hard decision but it may also be a soft decision.<br>
From the corrected received signal 326 and the response reference signal 320, the response vector computing<br><br>
unit 80 computes the response vector signal 322 as a 'receiving response characteristic of a received signal against a transmitted signal. Though the method for computing the response vector signals 322 may be arbitrary, a method carried out here is based on a correlation processing, for example, as will be explained hereinafter. It is assumed herein that the corrected received signals 326 and the response reference signals 320 are inputted not only from within the signal processing unit 18 but also from signal processing units corresponding to other user terminal apparatuses via signal lines, which are not shown here.  If a corrected received signal 326 corresponding to a first terminal apparatus is designated as X1(t), a corrected received signal 326 corresponding to a second terminal apparatus as x2(t), a response reference signal 320 corresponding to the first terminal apparatus as S1(t) and a response reference signal 320 corresponding to the second terminal apparatus as S2(t), then xx(t) and x2(t) will be expressed by the following Equation (1):<br>
(Equation Removed)  where hij is the response characteristic from an ith terminal apparatus to a jth basestation antenna 14j, with noise ignored. A first correlation matrix R1, with E as an ensemble average, is expressed by the following Equation (2) :<br>
 (Equation Removed)A second correlation matrix R2 for computing the correlation among the response reference signals 320 is given by the following Equation (3):<br>
(Equation Removed)Finally, the first correlation matrix R1 is multiplied by the inverse matrix of the second correlation matrix R2 so as to obtain a response vector signal 322, which is expressed by the following Equation (4):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The transmission weight vector computing unit 76 estimates the transmission weight vector signal 314 necessary for weighting the pre-separation signal 308, from the receiving weight vector signal 312 or the response vector signal 322 that reflects receiving response characteristics.  The method for estimating the transmission weight vector signals 314 may be arbitrary. As a most simple method therefor, however, the receiving weight vector signal 312 or the response vector signal 322 may be used as it is. As another method, the receiving weight vector signal 312 or the response vector signal 322 may be corrected using a conventional technique while the Doppler<br>
frequency variation of a  propagation environment between the timing of a receiving processing and the timing of a transmission processing is taken into account.  It is assumed herein that as the transmission weight vector signal 314 the response vector signal 322 is used as it is.<br>
The multipliers 74 weight the pre-separation signal 308 by the transmission weight vector signals 314 respectively so as to output the digital transmitted signals 302.  It is assumed herein that the timing in the above operation follows the signal processor control signal 310.<br>
In terms of hardware, the above-described structure can be realized by a CPU, a memory and other LSIs of an arbitrary computer.  In terms of software, it is realized by memory-loaded programs which have a reserved management function or the like, but drawn and described herein are function blocks that are realized in cooperation with those. Thus, it is understood by those skilled in the art that these function blocks can be realized in a variety of forms such as by hardware only, software only or the combination thereof.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a structure of a frequency offset correcting unit 110. The frequency offset correcting units 110 are a generic name given for a first frequency offset correcting unit 110a, a second frequency offset correcting unit 110b, ... and an Nth.  frequency offset correcting unit llOn.  Each of the frequency offset correcting units 110<br>
includes a delay unit 120, a phase error detector 122, an 'averaging unit 124, an initial frequency setting unit 126, a multiplier 128, a multiplier 130 and a residual frequency setting unit 132.<br>
The delay unit 120 delays the inputted digital received signals 300. Here, the delay unit 120 delays them by one symbol. The phase error detector 122 detects phase error between the delayed digital received signal 300 and the inputted digital received signal 300.  This phase error corresponds to a rotation amount of phase in one symbol due to the frequency offset.  If the digital received signals 300 contain signal components, the signal components are removed.  The averaging unit 124 averages out the phase error detected by the phase error detector 122, for the purpose of suppressing noise components. The initial frequency setting unit 126 sets the phase error averaged by the averaging unit 124 as a phase error corresponding to the initial frequency offset, and outputs signals to be oscillated based on the initial frequency offset.  The multiplier 128 multiplies the signals to be oscillated based on the initial frequency offset outputted from the initial frequency setting unit 126, by the inputted digital received signals 300 so as to remove the initial frequency offset components from the inputted digital received signals 300.<br>
The residual frequency setting unit 132 sets the residual frequency offsets by successively updating them<br>
with the residual frequency signals 324 which have been inputted externally, and outputs signals which are oscillated based on the mostly recently updated residual frequency offsets.  Here, since the residual frequency signals 324 are inputted after a training signal interval has been terminated, the signals which are oscillated based on the residual frequency offsets are outputted after the training signal has been terminated.  The multiplier 130 multiplies output signals from the multiplier 128 by outputs signals from the residual frequency setting unit 132 so as to remove the residual frequency offsets contained in the output signals from the multiplier 128, and it outputs the resulting signals as corrected received signals 326.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a structure of receiving weight vector computing units 68. The receiving weight vector computing units 68 are a generical name given for a first receiving weight vector computing unit 68a, a second receiving weight vector computing unit 68b, ... and an Nth receiving weight vector computing unit 68n.  Each of the receiving weight vector computing units 68 includes an adder 140, a complex conjugation unit 142, a multiplier 148, a step-size parameter storage unit 150, a multiplier 152, an adder 154, a delay unit 156 and an estimation unit 158.  The estimation unit 158 includes a complex conjugation unit 160, a multiplier 162, a divider 164, an imaginary component extracting unit 166 and a multiplier 168.<br>
The adder 140 computes the difference between the synthesized signal 304 and the weight reference signal 306, and outputs an error signal, namely, an error vector. This error signal is subjected to a complex conjugation conversion by the complex conjugation unit 142.<br>
The multiplier 148 multiplies the complex-conjugation-converted error signal by the first corrected received signal 362a so as to generate a first multiplication result.<br>
The multiplier 152 multiplies the first multiplication result by a step-size parameter stored in the step-size parameter storage unit 150 so as to generate a second multiplication result.  The second multiplication result is subjected to a feedback by the delay unit 156 and the adder 154 and is then added with a new second multiplication result.  In this manner, the result of addition updated successively by the LMS algorithm is outputted as a receiving weight vector 312.<br>
The estimation unit 158 estimates residual frequency offsets.  Before describing each component of the estimation unit 158, an overall operation of an estimation unit 158 will be outlined.  It is assumed herein that a receiving weight vector corresponds to a receiving weight vector signal 312, a receiving weight vector at time t is designated as W(t) and a phase    corresponds to the residual frequency offset contained in the corrected received signal 326.  Then, a receiving weight vector W(t+1) is expressed by<br>
the following Equation (5):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
If error between the receiving weight vectors W(t+1) and W(t) is A, a relationship between the receiving weight vectors W(t+1) and W(t) is expressed by the following Equation (6):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Combining or equating the above Equation (5) and Equation (6) results in:<br>
(Equation Removed)If the phase    is small, the Equation (7) is expressed by:<br>
(Equation Removed)Hence, the phase  is expressed by:<br>
(Equation Removed)where "Img" indicates the imaginary component.  If the Equation (6) is associated to a recurrence fomula of LMS algorithm, the error will be expressed by:<br>
A = n-X*(t)-e(t)  — (10) where µ  is a step-size parameter in LMS algorithm, X is a vector that corresponds to a corrected received signal 326, and e indicates a vector that corresponds to an error signal in LMS algorithm.  Hence, the phase  to be estimated is expressed by:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
That is, the estimation unit 158 is so structured as to compute the Equation (11).<br>
The complex conjugation unit 160 performs complex conjugation conversion on corrected received signals 326. The multiplier 162 multiplies the complex-conjugation-converted corrected received signal 326 by the error signal outputted from the adder 140. The divider 164 divides a multiplication result obtained by the multiplier 162 by a receiving weight vector signal 312 outputted from the delay unit 156.  The imaginary component extracting unit 166 extracts imaginary components from a division result. The multiplier 168 multiplies the imaginary components in the division result by a step-size parameter so as to generate and output residual frequency signals 324.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart showing a procedure of correcting frequency offsets.  During a period of preamble signal (Y of S10), the delay unit 120, phase error detector 122 and averaging unit 124 estimate initial frequency offsets (S12) . When the estimation has been completed, the initial frequency setting unit 126 sets the estimated initial frequency offsets and the multiplier 128 corrects the initial frequency offsets contained in the digital received signals 300 (S14). When the preamble period terminates (N of S10), the multiplier 128 corrects the<br>
initial frequency offsets contained in the digital received signals 300 (S16).<br>
Then the residual frequency setting unit 132 and multiplier 130 the already-estimated residual frequency signals 324 (S18) and output the corrected received signals 326.  If a training signal period is taking place even after the termination of a preamble signal period, this step (S18) will not be executed because the residual frequency signal 324 has not been estimated. The receiving weight vector computing unit 68 estimates, from the corrected received signals 326, receiving weight vector signals 312 and residual frequency signals 324 (S20). Then, the residual frequency signals 324 are fed back to the residual frequency setting unit 132 and based on the receiving weight vector signals 312 the multiplier 62 and adder 64 perform adaptive array processing on the corrected received signals 326 so as to output a synthesized signal 304.<br>
An operation of the base station apparatus 34 that employs the above structure will be described hereinbelow. During a preamble signal period of received burst, the delay unit 120, phase error detector 122 and the averaging unit 124 estimate initial frequency offsets contained in digital received signals 300.  During a training signal period, output signals from the multiplier 128 are outputted as the corrected received signals 326.  The corrected received signals 326 are inputted to the receiving weight vector<br>
computing unit 68, and the receiving weight vector computing unit 68 estimates receiving weight vector signals 312 and residual frequency signals 324. After the corrected received signals 326 have been weighted with the receiving weight vector signals 312 by the multipliers 62, the thus weighted signals 326 are summed by the adder 64 so as to be outputted as a synthesized signal 304. After the termination of a training signal period, the output signals from the multiplier 128 are corrected, by the multiplier 130, with residual frequency error based on the residual frequency signal 324 and are then outputted as the corrected received signals 326.  The corrected received signals 326 are inputted to the receiving weight vector computing unit 68, and the receiving weight vector computing unit 68 estimates receiving weight vector signals 312 and residual frequency signals 324. After the corrected received signals 326 have been weighted with the receiving weight vector signals 312 by the multipliers 62, the thus weighted signals are summed by the adder 64 so as to be outputted as a synthesized signal 304.<br>
According to the first embodiment, the initial frequency offsets are corrected by the feedforward prior to computing the receiving weight vectors and the residual components of frequency offsets are corrected in parallel with the receiving weight vectors.  Thus, the frequency offsets can be corrected when the frequency offset is large.<br>
Moreover, there is no need to change parameters necessary for obtaining the receiving weight vectors in adaptive algorithm. Thus, the deterioration of signal transmission quality due to noise can be prevented. Moreover, values computed in a process of adaptive algorithm can also be used in computing the residual components of frequency offsets, so that the increase in circuit scale can be suppressed.<br>
Second embodiment<br>
A second embodiment according to the present invention, similar to the first embodiment, relates to a base station apparatus which performs adaptive array signal processing on a plurality of signals received by a plurality of antennas, and it is assumed here that the received signals are multi-carrier signals and, in particular, those modulated by OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).  The base station apparatus according to the second embodiment corrects? frequency offsets before it executes FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). And the base station apparatus applies LMS algorithm to the FFT-performed signals and then estimates receiving weight vectors and residual frequency offsets.  Then, the thus estimated residual frequency offsets are fed back to a stage that precedes the FFT-performing stage.<br>
Before describing the second embodiment in detail, how the phase of an FFT-performed signal rotates if frequency<br>
offset is present in a received signal will be explained first. A signal transmitted from a transmitting apparatus is expressed by: (Equation Removed)<br>
where Ai to An are each a vector that indicates a signal component contained in each sub-carrier.  If frequency offset is added to a signal transmitted, then a received signal having such frequency offset is expressed by: <br>
(Equation Removed)— (13)<br>
When the frequency offset is small, exp(jcot) can be<br>
approximated to a constant C and the signal in Equation (13)<br>
can be expressed by:<br>
(Equation Removed) (14)<br>
When this signal is subjected to FFT, each sub-carrier is expressed as CA1, CA2 or the like.  It is to be noted here that each sub-carrier signal is rotated by a phase that corresponds to its frequency offset.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a structure of a burst format according to the second embodiment.  This is the burst format used in the traffic channel of IEEE802.11a which is one of wireless LANs (Local Area Networks).  IEEE802.11a uses OFDM modulation scheme, and in the OFDM scheme the total of Fourier transform size and the number of symbols in guard interval constitutes a unit ih general.  In the present<br>
embodiment, this single unit is defined as OFDM symbols.  A preamble which is to be used mainly for timing synchronization and carrier recovery is placed in the four leading symbols of a burst.  Since the preamble signal is a signal known to the signal processing unit 18, the signal processing unit 18 can use a preamble as a training signal. "Header" and "data" that follow the "preamble" are signals which are not known to the signal processing unit 18 and they correspond to data signals.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a structure of a signal processing unit 18 according to the second embodiment.  Functions relating to transmission as shown in FIG. 4 are omitted in the signal processing unit 18 shown in FIG. 9. Compared to the signal processing unit 18 shown in FIG. 4, an FFT unit 170 is newly added in the signal processing unit 18 of FIG. 9, and signals involved therein include a first frequency-domain signal 330a, a second frequency-domain signal 330b, ... and an Nth frequency-domain signal 330n, which are generically named frequency-domain signals 330.<br>
The FFT unit 170 performs Fourier transform on corrected received signals 326 and then outputs frequency-domain signals 330.  It is assumed here that a single frequency-domain signal 330 is such that signals corresponding to sub-carriers are placed in series.  This is illustrated in FIG. 10.  In FIG. 10, the number of sub-carriers is M and only signals corresponding to one OFDM<br><br>
symbol are shown.  That is, a plurality of OFDM symbol signals are realized by one OFDM symbol, as shown in FIG. 10, repeated a number of times.<br>
Since the FFT unit 170 transforms the signals to those in frequency domain, the operation of the receiving weight vector computing unit 68, multiplier 62 and adder 64 are also changed in a form that corresponds accordingly thereto. That is, if the number of antennas is N and the number of sub-carriers is M as described earlier, LMS algorithm associated to a sub-carrier m is expressed by the following Equation (15).<br>
(Equation Removed)where Wm(t) is a receiving response vector that corresponds to the sub-carrier m at time t, and the number of components is the number of antennas, that is, N.fLMS algorithm is effected and applied to all sub-carriers, and processings by the multiplier 62 and adder 64 are also executed per sub-carrier. On the other hand, the residual frequency offset is expressed, per antenna, by the following Equation (16).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
It is to be noted that the LMS algorithm in Equation (15) and the estimation of residual frequency offset in Equation (16) are executed, respectively, in units of 1 OFDM symbol.<br>
FIG. 11 is a result of simulation to illustrate an advantageous effect of the signal processing unit 18. Here, the present embodiment is applied to a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) system. Here, the MIMO system is such that a base station apparatus 34 and a terminal apparatus 10 are each equipped with a plurality of antennas and a channel suitable for each of the antennas is set.  That is, the channel of up to the maximum number of antennas is set for the communication between the base station apparatus 34 and the terminal apparatus 10, so as to improve the data transmission rate.  It is to be noted here that the channel between the base station apparatus 34 and the terminal apparatus 10 is generally separated by the use of the adaptive antenna technology.<br>
As conditions for simulation, a MIMO system is assumed where the number of antennas at a transmitting side is two whereas that at a receiving side is two. Also, the conditions are such that the number of sub-carriers and one OFDM symbol period are 52 and 4 |asec, respectively, in the OFDM modulation scheme, which are the same as in IEEE802.11a standard.  Furthermore, the modulation scheme was 64QAM and PER (Packet Error Rate), which indicates a rate at which the error is contained under a Gaussian noise environment in units of burst, is measured.  In order to particularly show how effective the estimation of residual frequency offsets is, the estimation and correction of initial frequency<br>
offsets are not carried out here, and 500 Hz is given as frequency offset. And convolution coding is used as an error correcting scheme and the coding rate is set to R=3/4.<br>
As is evident from FIG. 11, PER deteriorates if the estimation of residual frequency offsets is not carried out. That is, this is equivalent to indicating that the transmission quality deteriorates. On the other hand, if the estimation of residual frequency offsets is carried out its PER is close to that having no frequency offset. This shows the advantageous effect in estimating the residual frequency offsets according to the present embodiment.<br>
According to the present embodiments, even in a multi-carrier system the initial frequency offsets are corrected by feedforward prior to computing the receiving weight vectors and the residual components in the frequency offsets are corrected in parallel with the processing of the receiving weight vectors.  Thus, if the frequency offsets v are large, they can be corrected. Moreover, the values which have been calculated and obtained in a processing of adaptive algorithm can be conveniently used also in computing the residual components of frequency offsets, so that the increase in circuit scale can be suppressed. Moreover, the multi-carrier transmission is more likely to suffer from the adverse effect of frequency offsets, compared to the case of a single carrier, so that the transmission quality of signals can be more improved than in<br>
the case of a signal carrier.<br>
The present invention has been described based on the embodiments which are only exemplary.  It is understood by those skilled in the art that there exist other various modifications to the combination of each component and process described above and that such modifications are encompassed by the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the first and the second embodiment, the receiving weight vector computing unit 68 uses LMS algorithm as an adaptive algorithm by which to estimate the receiving weight vector signals 312. However, an adaptive algorithm other than LMS algorithm may be used in the receiving weight vector computing.  For example, RLS algorithm may be used. According to this modified example, the timing at which the receiving weight vector signals 312 converge can be faster and the whole receiving processing can be done at high speed. That is, it suffices if receiving weight vectors and error vectors necessary for estimating residual frequency offsets are generated.<br>
In the first embodiment, the delay unit 120 delays the digital received signal 300 by one symbol to estimate the initial frequency offsets. However, the embodiments are not limited thereto and, fox example, the digital received signal 300 may be delayed by a plurality of symbols^ According to this modified example, the accuracy of detecting the frequency offsets is improved.  That is, the<br>
number of symbols to be delayed may be set in accordance with a value which is to be scheduled as a residual component of frequency offset.<br>
Although the present invention has been described by way of exemplary embodiments and modified examples as above, it should be understood that many changes and substitutions may still further be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention which is defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
