				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pesticidal composition and to a method for<br>
controlling pests.<br>
Pyrethroid compounds have excellent pesticidal activity. In recent years, however, various kinds of pests have developed resistance to pyrethroid compounds, so that pest-control effects cannot be attained at a satisfactory level in certain cases. Thus, there has been a demand for the development of controlling agents which can exhibit excellent effects even against various kinds of pests having such developed resistance.<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors have extensively studied. As a result, they have found that a pesticidal composition containing as active ingredients, 3,5-dichloro-l-{3,3-dichloro-2-propenyloxy)-4-[3-(5-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yloxy)propoxy] benzene of the formula:<br><br>
and a specific pyrethroid compound as recited below, can attain the effective control of both pyrethroid-resistant pests and pyrethroid-nonresistant pests and that their cooperative action is synergistic and therefore the application amount of pyrethroid compounds can be reduced as well as the development of pyrethroid resistance can be Inhibited, thereby completing the present invention.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention provides a pesticidal composition which comprises as active ingredients, 3,5-dichloro-l-(3,3-dichloro-2-propenyloxy)-4-[3-(5-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yloxy)propoxy]benzene of the formula:<br><br>

Test Example 1: Damage-inhibitory test against Helicoverpa armigera (pest line resistant to synthetic pyrethroid agents)<br>
Into an aqueous dilution of a test compound(s) formulation obtained according to Formulation Example 1 were immersed some four-instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera for 5 seconds, followed by the removal of excess water with filter paper. These larvae were then given untreated cotton leaf chips (diameter, 1 cm) for feeding. Ten larvae were used for each treatment. After 24 hours, the degree of damage by eating on the cotton leaf chips was evaluated on the criteria recited below, and the damage-inhibitory rate was determined by the following equation:<br><br>
Criteria for the degree of damage by eating: 0 = 0% damaged area ; 1<br><br>
= from 1% to 10% damaged area 2 — from 11% to 20% damaged ares.j 3 ~ from 21% to 30% damaged area; 4 = from 31% to 40% damaged area; 5 = from 41% to 50% damaged area; 6 = from 51% to 60% damaged area; 7 = from 61% to 70% damaged area; 8 = from 71% to 80% damaged area; 9 = from 81% to 90% damaged area; and 10 = from 91% to 100% damaged area. Each value of percent damaged area was rounded off to the first decimal point. The results are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Test Example 2: Damage-inhibitory test against Helicoverpa armigera {pest line resistant to synthetic pyrethroid agents)<br>
First, 10 parts of compound (I) was dissolved in 37 parts of xylene and 37 parts of dimethylformamide, to which 10 parts of polyoxyethylene styryl phenyl ether and 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate were added, and the mixture was well stirred to give an emulsifiable concentrate.<br><br>
An aqueous dilution of the emulsifiable concentrate was mixed with an aqueous dilution of a commercially available emulsifiable concentrate of permethrin (trade name, Adion; from Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) or cypermethrin (trade name, Agrothrin; from Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) to have a prescribed concentration.<br>
Into the dilution were immersed some four-instar Iarvae of Helicoverpa armigera for 5 seconds, followed by the removal of excess water with filter paper. These larvae were then given untreated cotton leaf chips for feeding. Ten larvae were used for each treatment. After 24 hours, the degree of damage by eating on the cotton leaf chips was evaluated on the criteria recited below, and the damage-inhibitory rate was determined by the following equation:<br><br>
Criteria for the degree of damage by eating: 0 = 0% damaged area ; 1 = from 1% to 10% damaged area; 2 — from 11% to 20% damaged area; 3 = horn. 21% to 30% damaged area; 4 = irom 31% to 40% damaged area; 5 = horn 41% to 50% damaged area; 6 = from 51% to 60% damaged area; 7 = from 61% to 70% damaged area; 8 = from 71% to 80% damaged area; 9 = from 81% to 90% damaged area; and 10 = from 91% to 100% damaged area. Each value of percent damaged area was rounded oft to the first decimal point.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
Test Example 3: Insecticidal test against Plutella xylostella (pest line resistant to organic phosphorous agents, synthetic pyrethroid agents and other agents)<br>
To an aqueous dilution of a test compound(s) formulation obtained according to Formulation Example 1 was added a spreading agent (New RINOU available from Nihon Noyaku K.K.) at a dilution ratio of 3000-fold. The dilution was sprayed over potted cabbages at the four to five leaf stage at a volume of 25 ml per pot. After the treated plants were air dried, twenty third-instar larvae of Plutella xylosteUa were set free on each pot. After 5 days, the mortality was determined.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
Test Example 4: Insecticidal test against Helicoverpa armigera (pest line resistant to synthetic pyrethroid agents)<br>
First, 10 parts of compound (I) was dissolved in 37 parts of xylene and 37 parts of dimethylformamide, to which 10 parts of polyoxyethylene styryl phenyl ether and 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzenesuifnonate were added, and the mixture was well stirred to give an emulsifiahle concentrate.<br>
An aqueous dilution of the emulsifiahle concentrate was mixed with an aqueous dilution of a commercially available emulsifiahle concentrate of lamhda-cyhalothrin (trade name, Karate; from Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.), deltamethrin (trade name, Decis; from Hoechst AG) or Cyfluthrin (trade name, Baythroid; from Bayer AG) to have a prescribed concentration.<br>
Into the dilution were immersed some four-instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera for 5 seconds, followed by the removal of excess water with filter paper. These larvae were then given untreated cotton leaf chips for feeding. Ten larvae were used for each treatment. After 24 hours, the mortality including moribundity was determined.<br>
The results are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br><br><br>
