				<td>Process for plasma surface treatment and device for realizing the process<br>
The present invention concerns a process for plasma surface treatment and a device for<br>
realization of the process. The treatment can be deposition of a barrier film or plurality<br>
of thin films, sterilization, cleaning, etching, or creation of a surface alloy. The present<br>
invention also concerns a process for treatment or production of powders with plasma.<br>
In the current state of the art, plasma depositions are offered in vacuum and at<br>
atmospheric pressure. The vacuum technologies provide for a uniform treatment of<br>
complex surfaces such as the inner surface of a PET bottle, but they are slow and<br>
relatively expensive, since it is necessary to create, and work in, a vacuum chamber. The<br>
corresponding equipment is complex, extremely costly, and difficult to adapt to different<br>
types of container. The requirement that the equipment be perfectly tight is very difficult<br>
to satisfy and has repercussions on the reliability of the process and uniformity of the<br>
results.<br>
Processes working with plasmas at atmospheric pressure have been discussed in several<br>
publications, for instance the patent GB 1,098,693, the patent application WO 97/22369,<br>
and the patent application WO 99/46964.<br>
In the patent GB 1,098,693, a device for treatment of the inner surface of a plastic bottle<br>
designed to sterilize this surface is described. The device comprises a central electrode<br>
introduced into the bottle and an external electrode surrounding the bottle, the two<br>
electrodes forming a coaxial system connected to a high-frequency current source.<br>
Argon (Ar) is introduced into the bottle through a hole in the central electrode in order<br>
to reduce the electric potential needed to create the plasma. The device described in this<br>
patent is characterized by a high electric field, of the order of 450 V/cm, and a very<br>
weak current, of the order of a few milliamperes. The treatment time is too long and the<br>
power too low for this process to find industrial application and to be able to compete<br>
with the vacuum plasma techniques.<br>
In the patent application WO 97/22369 concerning the sterilization of plastic containers<br>
it is proposed to form a plasma with a source of RF current providing a high-amplitude<br>
current. It is proposed, moreover, to take the central electrode out of the bottle, which<br>
permits a rhythm of PET bottle sterilization in line with industrial needs. It is a<br>
disadvantage of the process and of the device described in this application that they will<br>
not permit a uniform treatment of the surface to be treated. It is to be expected that the<br>
plasma covers only part of this surface. This results in poor sterilization of surface parts<br>
that have not been in contact with the plasma. For the same reasons such a process<br>
would not be able to provide a uniform barrier all over the inside walls of a container.<br>
In the patent application WO 99/46964, a surface treatment process is described where a<br>
pulsed plasma string is formed at atmospheric pressure which sweeps the surface to be<br>
treated by relative motion of this surface and the device producing and defining the<br>
plasma string. One might expect that such a process would be able to yield a layer that is<br>
impermeabilizing, for instance, or could uniformly sterilize the surface to be treated,<br>
since the plasma string sweeps all of the surface to be treated. In reality it is found to be<br>
difficult to obtain a surface treatment, and more particularly the deposition of a film or a<br>
sterilization of satisfactory quality.<br>
For reasons of local heating the plasma column must be moved relative to the surface to<br>
be treated. The velocity dictated by the need not to overheat the material of the surface<br>
to be treated is higher than the optimum speed of treatment in many applications. One of<br>
the consequences is that a boundary layer of cold gas drawn along by the object blows<br>
into the discharge and moves it away from the surface to be treated. This removal lowers<br>
the diffusive flux of active plasma particles toward the surface to be treated. This<br>
problem can be resolved in part by renewing the discharge by pulses. However, the<br>
pulse frequency is also dictated by the need not to overheat the material of the surface to<br>
be treated, and hence cannot he optimized for different applications.<br>
The volume of plasma created by known processes for atmospheric plasma treatment is<br>
large and leads to poor yields, since large part of the energy input is lost for heating the<br>
surrounding gas and the object to be treated. For applications involving the deposition of<br>
barrier films, on the other hand, powder forms in the bulk of the plasma string (SiO2<br>
powder, for instance) and deposits on the surface to be treated. This powder, which<br>
adheres but weakly to the surface, represents an obstacle to the creation of high-quality<br>
films.<br>
The disadvantages and limitations of known plasma treatment processes are not limited<br>
to the points described above. For example, in the case of plasmas close to a<br>
thermodynamic equilibrium state, such as would arise from the process described in<br>
WO 99/46964, it is difficult to perform an electron bombardment of the surface to be<br>
treated, since in general the mean path of the electrons (= 10-4 cm) relative to the elastic<br>
interactions of the surface to be treated is shorter than the thickness of the plasma<br>
boundary layer (= 10-2 cm). It follows that it is difficult for such a process to adapt the<br>
substrate/film interface to a desired quality of treatment, for instance by activating the<br>
surface to be treated prior to film deposition so as to ensure good adhesion. It follows<br>
that it would be equally difficult to produce films consisting of several layers differing<br>
in their composition, with each layer being activated prior to deposition of the following<br>
layer.<br>
Experience shows that despite the relative motion of the plasma and object to be treated<br>
in known processes, local overheating is inevitable and provokes electrical discharge<br>
breakdowns that give rise to defects and local destruction of the surface to be treated.<br>
This disadvantage is particularly important in certain applications, as will be explained<br>
by way of example hereinafter.<br>
Polymerizable materials such as PET (polylethyleneterephthalate), PE (polyethylene),<br>
PP (polypropylene) and others are used in various industries for products such as con-<br>
tainers for beverages and food, the pharmaceutical and perfume bottles and tubes,<br>
gasoline tanks, containers for chemical products, as well as the neon tubes for night-<br>
time advertizing, particularly for reasons of low cost and weight of these materials. Yet<br>
one of the disadvantages of polymeric materials is thsir gas permeability. The<br>
permeability of the PET bottles used in the food industry, for instance, lets oxygen<br>
diffuse through the bottle wall and oxidize the food or beverages, which for this reason<br>
progressively lose their properties such as their taste, odor or color. Carbonated<br>
beverages to the contrary lose their carbon dioxide.. Excessive plastic container per-<br>
meability shortens the time of conservation of the foods. Gas diffusion across the plastic<br>
walls can have ill effects on large number of other products such as pharmaceuticals,<br>
cosmetics, hygiene and housekeeping products. In the case of gasoline tanks or other<br>
containers holding chemicals, the permeability of the plastic materials allows these<br>
chemicals to penetrate into the plastic material so that this can no longer be recycled<br>
easily and may present a fire hazard. The permeability of plastics implies that neon tubes<br>
in plastic have a lifetime too short to be marketable.<br>
Another problem of plastic materials arises from aromatic molecules such as acet-<br>
aldehyde forming in the bulk material and then diffusing toward the surface where they<br>
enter the liquid held by the container. Such molecules alter the taste and odor of the<br>
beverage or food item.<br>
One solution consists in coating the inside of the container by an impermeable film<br>
called "barrier". Different compositions such as carbon, aluminum oxide, and silicon<br>
oxide (S1O2) can form barriers on polymers. The deposition of a barrier film can be<br>
carried out by plasma in contact with the surface, and in the presence of a gas furnishing<br>
the molecules that will form the layer. However, the plastic materials mentioned above<br>
do not withstand temperatures above around 60 to 70 ºC, so that it is difficult with the<br>
known plasma treatment processes to avoid local overheating or obtain a sufficiently<br>
high quality of the treatment. For instance, the barrier films deposited on PET bottles by<br>
traditional industrial plasma treatment processes yield a factor (RIF) of impermeability<br>
enhancement relative to the untreated material that is of the order of 20 to 30 for oxygen<br>
or 5 to 6 for CO2. Typical defects of such barrier layers are lack of adhesion and<br>
flexibility and the appearance of cracks leading to a loss of impermeability. These<br>
defects may also represent a hazard for the consumer.<br>
Many other materials do not withstand the temperature rise that would be required for<br>
optimizing the plasma surface treatment process. This is the case, for instance, with the<br>
silicon wafers used in semiconductor industry. The semiconducting structures at the<br>
surface of the circuits can in fact be altered or damaged by high treatment temperatures<br>
because of an accelerated particle diffusion across the interfaces of the different layers<br>
deposited on the silicon wafer.<br>
As concerns powders, in particular powders formed of composite grains, physical,<br>
chemical methods of powder production are known for producing grains comprising a<br>
core and a peripheral layer or zone. The composition of the peripheral zone or outer<br>
layers may be different to that of the core. Known methods of the disadvantage of being<br>
relatively slow and costly, and moreover do not enable the formation of very thin<br>
uniform outer layers.<br>
It is known to produce non-composite powders from a gas by means of a plasma<br>
treatment. Known powder producing methods consume a lot of energy and are relatively<br>
slow and costly.<br>
In view of the drawbacks cited above, it is an objective of the present invention to<br>
provide a plasma surface treatment process that is performant and reliable in an<br>
industrial environment, as well as a device for performing a plasma surface treatment<br>
process that is performant and reliable in an industrial environment.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a plasma surface treatment process as well as a device for<br>
realizing the process that can be used to treat the surfaces of materials that are sensitive<br>
to high temperatures.<br>
It is advantageous to be able to deposit a barrier on containers (particularly plastic<br>
containers such as PET bottles in the food industry, polyethylene tubes in perfumery,<br>
and gasoline tanks in the automobile) that is strong, flexible and has a good imper-<br>
meability. It would be advantageous to be able to simultaneously treat the inner and<br>
outer surfaces of hollow objects (bottles, tubes, tanks). It is advantageous to be able to<br>
treat the surface of a complex object.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a plasma surface treatment process as well as a device for<br>
realizing the process that can be used to deposit several layers of different materials on a<br>
surface to be treated.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a plasma surface treatment process as well as a device for<br>
realizing the process that can be used to deposit one or several layers of different<br>
materials on the surface of a sub-micronic or nanometric core or nucleus, thereby<br>
producing powders with composite grains.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a process for producing powder grains with outer or<br>
superficial layers surrounding the core or nucleus of the grain having a good uniformity<br>
and a specified thickness.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a method for producing composite powder grains of sub-<br>
micronic or nanometric size, that is efficient and low-cost.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a method for producing composite powder grains formed<br>
of a nucleus and one or more outer layers surrounding the nucleus, the powder having<br>
different physical, chemical properties than the properties of the nucleus alone.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method of producing powders from a gas,<br>
by means of plasma treatment, that is efficient, low-cost and that enables the production<br>
of powders of high quality.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a method of producing powders formed of mono-<br>
crystalline grains of nanometric size.<br>
It is also advantageous to be able to perform other surface treatments such as cleaning,<br>
etching, surface activation, sterilization or the formation of surface alloys.<br>
It is also be advantageous in many applications, moreover, to realize a process of plasma<br>
surface treatment at atmospheric pressure as well as a device for realizing the process.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides plasma treatment process of an<br>
object's surface to be treated, comprising the creation of a plasma, the<br>
application of the plasma to the surface to be treated, characterized in that the<br>
surface to be treated is excited or the plasma is acoustically vibrated so that a<br>
relative undulating movement between the surface to be treated and plasma is<br>
created, energy for the excitation of the surface to be treated supplied by the<br>
plasma creation process.<br>
The present invention also provides method of producing powder comprising the<br>
generation of a pulsed plasma in a chamber comprising plasma chemical gases,<br>
and the simultaneous generation of acoustic vibrations in the chamber, the<br>
gases being decomposed by the plasma to form clusters whose degree of<br>
structuration is determined by the simultaneous action of the plasma and<br>
acoustic vibrations.<br><br>
Ill the present invention, a process for plasma treatment of an object's surface to be<br>
treated comprises the creation of a plasma, the application of the plasma to the surface<br>
to be treated, and the excitation of the surface to be treated, such that it vibrates and<br>
undulates. The energy for excitation of the surface may come from the process creating<br>
the plasma, from an external source, or from a combination of these two sources. The<br>
vibration preferably takes place while the plasma is being applied to the surface to be<br>
treated, but depending on the treatment to carry out, it may also take place just prior to<br>
and/or just after the application phase.<br>
The energy for excitation of the surface that comes from the process creating the plasma<br>
can advantageously come from a shock wave developing at the plasma front during its<br>
creation. The shock wave is created by arranging that the front of plasma development<br>
will create within the plasma a pressure such that its ratio to the ambient pressure be<br>
above the critical value for formation of a shock wave in the given gaseous medium.<br>
This is obtained by selection and control of the plasma generation parameters,<br>
particularly the energy density and the lifetime of the plasma development front.<br>
The energy for surface excitation coming from an external source can come from a<br>
vibration generator brought in contact with the object to be treated, or not in direct<br>
contact with the object to be treated, which emits acoustic waves, for instance ultrasonic<br>
waves. For many applications and many objects to be treated, the vibration frequency<br>
will advantageously be within the range of ultrasonic frequencies. The external<br>
generator can also furnish enery in the form of shock waves.<br>
The vibration of the surface to be treated can be the result of excitation of one or several<br>
cigenfrequencies and their harmonics associated with the body of the object to be<br>
treated, by an abrupt leap of energy (shock) and/or by the action of an external generator<br>
emitting one of several frequencies close to or identical with eigenfrequencies or their<br>
harmonics associated with the object to be treated. The vibration of the surface to be<br>
treated can also result from forced frequencies when an external generator emits<br>
frequencies that are not harmonics of the eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated.<br>
For most applications the plasma is preferably created with an electrical or electro-<br>
magnetic energy source operated continuously, by unipolar or alternating pulses, or at<br>
high frequency. This may for instance be a discharge of the capacitive or inductive type,<br>
or high-frequency waves. However, the plasma can also be created by adiabatic<br>
compression or by shock waves, furnished for instance by an adiabatic-compression or<br>
shock-wave generator.<br>
The plasma created by a surface treatment process according to advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention may be in thermodynamic disequilibrium for large part of<br>
the plasma's lifetime,<br>
The process according to the invention is very advantageous, since it permits utilization<br>
of a cold plasma while intensifying the interaction of the plasma with the surface to be<br>
treated, and hence to optimize the plasma surface treatments for a large range of<br>
applications, including treatments of objects consisting of materials withstanding only a<br>
very slight temperature increase, such as PET and semiconductors. The wave motion of<br>
the atoms and molecules of the surface to be treated actually intensifies the effect of the<br>
activated plasma particles on the surface to be treated. Because of the intensified effect,<br>
one has a larger choice of plasma generation modes (adiabatic compression, shock<br>
waves, electrical discharge) and can optimize the process depending on the features<br>
(material, shape, dimensions) of the object to be treated and treatment to be performed.<br>
It is possible in particular to use a "cold" atmospheric plasma (as defined by R. F.<br>
Baddour and R. S. Timmins in "The Applications of Plasmas to Chemical Process",<br>
MIT Press, page 17), that is, out of thermodynamic equilibrium, so that the insulating<br>
surface to be treated remains cold while electrons can bombard the surface to activate it.<br>
This plasma can for instance consist of a network of filaments that appear, move along<br>
the surface, and disappear within times sufficiently short to not heat up the surface to be<br>
treated. As concerns the surface treatment of powder grains, the plasma may for<br>
example be formed within the volume of a recipient containing the powder grains.<br>
The process according to the invention also permits, on one hand an acceleration of the<br>
surface treatment, in that the ionization and activation of the plasma particles is<br>
produced with the aid of shock waves issuing from discharge filament branches while<br>
these are reflected by the surface to be treated, and on the other hand an intensification<br>
of the surface treatment without any important increase in temperature of the object to<br>
be treated, since the vibrations of the surface to be treated act upon the interaction with<br>
the plasma, essentially like the atomic agitation produced by an increase in temperature<br>
of the object.<br>
The surface treatment can be further intensified by adding the vibrations of an external<br>
acoustic frequency or ultrasound generator, preferably adjusted so as to amplify the<br>
eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated. The improved interaction of the plasma<br>
with the surface to be treated at low temperature has many other advantageous<br>
consequences. For instance, composite films of good quality can be obtained by the<br>
successive deposition of layers that adhere well to the substrate and have different<br>
physical, physicochemical, and mechanical properties.<br>
It is another advantage of the process according to the invention that it permits treatment<br>
of the inner walls of a complex object lacking axes of symmetry, such as a gasoline<br>
tank.<br>
In a process according to the present invention, it is also possible to produce powders<br>
formed of grains comprising a core or nucleus and a peripheral zone or outer layers of<br>
one or more different layers resulting from the deposit of a substantially uniform and<br>
homogeneous film of atoms and/or molecules that may provide the powder with<br>
properties that are different from the properties of the powder comprising only the<br>
nucleus material, for example optical properties.<br>
In the present invention, the composite powders may be made by depositing films on<br>
grain nuclei by means of a plasma at atmospheric pressure. The plasma serves on the<br>
one hand to heat and activate the surface of the grain nuclei for their entry into contact<br>
with the atoms and/or molecules of gas used to form the outer layers.<br>
The same plasma, or plasma generated downstream of the plasma activating the grain<br>
nuclei with an independent plasma generator, activates the atoms and molecules of a<br>
gaseous mixture comprising gases and/or vapors that are superheated. When the nuclei<br>
are brought into contact with the gaseous atoms and molecules, the plasma deposits a<br>
substantially homogenous molecular or atomic film on the surface of the nuclei which<br>
give the resulting powder physical chemical properties different from a powder<br>
comprised only of the nuclei, for example the optical properties may be changed.<br>
In particular, the parameters controlling the plasma are chosen such that the film deposit<br>
is particularly homogeneous and very thin.<br>
The components of the plasma generating the film are chosen such that the forces of<br>
attraction between the particles of the film have a centripetal component that assists in<br>
solidifying the structure of the peripheral layer or film. The smaller the size of the<br>
nuclei, the larger this centripetal component is. It is therefore particularly important in<br>
the case of sub-micronic or nanometric nuclei. In such cases, in order to separate<br>
effectively the grain nuclei floating in the supplied gas (for example argon) and to apply<br>
a vibration movement that catalyzes the process of surface deposition, the nuclei may be<br>
subjected to acoustic vibrations, in particular ultrasonic vibrations that may be generated<br>
by an external generator or thai may generated by the plasma itself, in a mode of<br>
generation of plasma by impulsions, as described herein below.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a process of producing powders comprises<br>
the generation of a plasma in pulses in a container comprising gases, and by the<br>
simultaneous generation of acoustic vibrations in this container, the gases being<br>
decomposed by the plasma in order to form clusters and powder grains in which the<br>
degree of structuration is determined by the simultaneous action of the plasma and the<br>
acoustic vibrations. The acoustic vibrations may be produced by an external generator<br>
and/or by the process of creation of the plasma itself, as described herebelow.<br>
A device of plasma surface treatment according to the invention can advantageously<br>
comprise an external acoustic vibration generator.<br>
A device of plasma surface treatment according to the invention can advantageously<br>
comprise a vibration sensor. The vibration sensor allows one to check and/or analyze the<br>
eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated, in order to adjust the device, for instance the<br>
parameters of the electrical circuit for generation of the electric discharge for creation of<br>
the plasma, for the production of shock waves which will produce vibration of the<br>
surface to be treated of a specific object to be treated, or for verifying the perfect<br>
functioning of the process and particularly the quality of the vibrations of the surface to<br>
be treated in an industrial process. In the presence of variations in the expected<br>
frequency and amplitude spectra, one might thus be informed about a possible failure or<br>
quality reduction of the surface treatment being carried out.<br>
A device of plasma surface treatment according to the invention can advantageously<br>
comprise one or several live electrodes provided with one or several process gas supply<br>
ducts for generation of one or several plasma jets by electrical discharge. The live<br>
electrode can advantageously be rotating, so that it will be able to move the plasma or<br>
plasmas by electrostatic and hydrodynamic effects along the surface to be treated.<br>
The device may comprise a live electrode that is in the form of a liquid jet that can<br>
execute a motion relative to the object to be treated, in order to project a conducting<br>
liquid jet against a wall of the object to be treated so that a plasma is created on the<br>
other side of the wall.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the electrodes for plasma generation by<br>
electrical discharge can be connected to the opposite poles of an electrical circuit. These<br>
electrodes can be utilized to generate a plasma on both sides of a wall of an object to be<br>
treated, the fluxes of the plasma being antiparallel on the two sides.<br>
One can also furnish a device with at least two live electrodes in order to treat respective<br>
sides of one wall of an object to be treated, the plasma fluxes on the two sides being<br>
parallel and directed toward a grounding electrode,<br>
A plasma surface treatment device according to the invention can advantageously<br>
comprise a liquid bath into which the objects to be treated, particularly containers, are<br>
immersed while plasma is applied to the inner surface to be treated. This can for<br>
instance be bottles or other containers partly immersed into the liquid bath, with their<br>
neck remaining above the surface of the liquid. The liquid thus is in contact with the<br>
outside of the container, which offers the advantage that the container wall can be<br>
cooled very efficiently and the plasma applied for a longer time. When an external<br>
source of vibrations is used, then the liquid will on the other hand serve to make the<br>
vibrations more uniform across the container wall, and thus on the container's inner<br>
surface to be treated.<br>
A plasma surface treatment device according to the invention can advantageously<br>
comprise a system of surface quality control after or during the treatment with a laser<br>
beam recording, either the number of photons emitted by non-linear effects during<br>
passage of the laser beam across the surface treated, or the decrease of the flux of<br>
primary protons due to their recombination resulting from non-linear effects, the laser<br>
beam system being provided with a device for the detection and analysis of the beam<br>
reflected from the surface to be treated or traversing the surface to the treated.<br>
A plasma surface treatment device according to the invention may comprise an<br>

a device with compressed air or other gases located in the section of the enclosure above<br>
the piston.<br>

comprise an enclosure with one section where the objects to be treated are arranged, and<br>
with another section where a process gas is kept under pressure and which is separated<br>
from the other section by a wall that can be removed or destroyed in order to permit<br>
instant decompression of the compressed gas for the purposes of creating a shock wave<br>
that moves in the direction of the objects to be treated.<br>

Referring to Figures la and lb, a device 1 for the treatment of a surface 2 of an object to<br>
be treated 3 generally comprises a device for plasma generation 4 including a gas supply<br>
system and an electrode 5, and a holding device 6 for holding the object to be treated.<br>
The treatment device 1 may also comprise an external vibration generator 7 that can<br>
induce the surface 2 of the object to be treated to vibrate, by means of an oscillator in<br>
direct contact with the object or via sonic (acoustic) waves without direct contact.<br>
A plasma 8 is created on the surface 2 of object 3 by the plasma generator 4 in a gas that<br>
can be activated plasma-chemically and is directed toward the surface 2 by a duct 9 of<br>
the gas supply system, where the duct can be formed within the electrode 5,<br>
The surface to be treated is excited so as to vibrate, that is, it performs a wave motion.<br>
The energy needed to generate the wave motion of the surface to be treated can be<br>
derived from a shock wave arising in the process of plasma creation, from a shock wave<br>
created by an external generator, of from an external vibration generator 7. A shock<br>
wave causes a body to vibrate in a transitory mode at its eigenfrequencies. The vibration<br>
amplitude can be boosted by an external vibration generator adjusted so as to generate<br>
vibrations at one or several eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated. As the vibration<br>
modes of bodies are extremely complex, the optimum choice of frequencies may be<br>
determined by tests, that is by adjusting the frequency differently for each of a certain<br>
number of samples and determining the features of surface treatment quality.<br>
An analysis of the surface treatment process according to the invention shows that by<br>
realizing wave motion of the particles of the surface to be treated one can intensify the<br>
physicochemical interaction between the plasma particles and the surface particles. By<br>
its nature and effects, this intensification resembles that accompanying an increase in<br>
temperature of the surface to be treated when in contact with the plasma, be it a vacuum<br>
plasma, an atmospheric plasma or a high-pressure plasma.<br>
Thus, a very important aspect of the invention is to intensify the process of plasma-<br>
chemical interaction, be it for deposition of a film, for etching, the creation of a surface<br>
alloy, or other kinds of treatment, without raising in any significant manner the<br>
temperature of the object to be treated. This technical solution is very important and<br>
opens up wide perspectives, particularly for the plasma treatment of bodies made of<br>
material not withstanding heating. On the other hand it allows the effects of a cold<br>
plasma on a surface to be valorized in a novel way, that is, the effects of a plasma out of<br>
thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium (see the definition on page 27 of the book of<br>
Baddour and Timmins cited earlier). The possibility of exciting the surface to be treated<br>
by a mechanical vibration while leaving it cold allows one in fact to decisively remedy<br>
the disadvantage inherent in the use of a cold plasma on a cold surface, since the<br>
interaction between the plasma and the surface to be treated is strongly intensified.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b present SEM (Surface Electron Microscope) photographs of the<br>
surface of an 0.5-liter-capacity PET bottle after a plasma treatment without excitation of<br>
the surface to be treated. In this case a silicon oxide film was deposited. The plasma<br>
employed in this example is a HF (high-frequency) pulse discharge plasma generated in<br>
a mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane vapors and argon. After the treatment the bottle was<br>
mechanically folded, and in these photographs one notices chips 10 and scales 11<br>
formed on the surface. These chips and scales can fall off and become incorporated into<br>
the liquid, thus representing a hazard to the consumer This also increases the<br>
permeability of the surface. By tests involving these bottles it could be established that<br>
the impermeability RIF (Relative Impermeability Factor) of the barrier film was about<br>
10 for oxygen, relative to an untreated surface. In the case of Fig. 2c the same surface<br>
treatment was carried out while adding vibrations having a frequency of about 21 kHz,<br>
that is, in the ultrasonic region, with the aid of an external ultrasound generator. The<br>
temperature of the PET walls of the bottle was measured during the treatment with a<br>
thermocouple, which showed that the temperature did not rise above 45 °C. This<br>
temperature is well below the maximum temperature of PET treatment, which is about<br>
60 to 70 °C. The bottle was then folded mechanically in the same way as the samples of<br>
Figures 2a and 2b, and one can notice in the SEM photograph that the barrier film<br>
obtained is sound and flexible, since neither chips nor scales are formed. The level of<br>
impermeability of the barrier film is very high. According to sample measurements, the<br>
RTF is about 30 for oxygen, relative to an untreated surface.<br>
It should be noted that the process according to the invention allows one to employ a<br>
plasma in vacuum, under atmospheric pressure, or under high pressure, since the action<br>
exerted by the vibrations of the surface to be treated on the interaction of this surface<br>
with the plasma does not significantly change with the pressure at which the plasma is<br>
generated. The treatment efficacy, on the other hand, again does not sigmeantly change<br>
with the manner in which the plasma is generated, be it in a continuous manner, with<br>
supply from dc sources, ac sources, high-frequency, microwaves, or pulses. In the latter<br>
case, the pulse period is preferably longer than the period of the vibration to which the<br>
object to be treated is subjected, in order to make sure that the contact between the<br>
plasma and the surface to be treated comes about.<br>
The shock wave originating with plasma creation can be generated by isochoric heating<br>
of a fraction of the volume of gas that can be activated plasma-chemically, by emitting<br>
an electrical pulse discharge obeying certain parameters, directly into the process gas.<br>
The volume fraction in question heats up, its pressure rises rapidly above the critical<br>
pressure above which a shock wave forms which propagates throughout the volume of<br>
the gas mixture and is followed by a plasma formed by particles of the process gas that<br>
are heated, excited, and ionized. This procedure is above all efficient when the electric<br>
current pulses are accomplished along the surface of the body to be treated, which<br>
consists of insulating materials. It can be used to good advantage to treat a complicated<br>
surface such as the inner walls of bottles, tubes, gasoline tanks and other containers.<br>
In Fig. 3a, a device 1 for the treatment of an inner surface 2 of an object to be treated 3,<br>
here a bottle, comprises a device for plasma generation 4 by electrical pulse discharges<br>
that is provided with a gas supply system comprising a duct 9 which can also function as<br>
live electrode 5, a holding device 6 with an insulating element 12 for holding the object<br>
to be treated, and a grounding electrode 15. The treatment device 1 can also include an<br>
external vibration generator 7, here an ultrasound generator, that can cause the inner<br>
surface 2 of the bottle to vibrate, a vibration sensor 13 that can be connected to a<br>
command module of the vibration generator 7, and a temperature sensor 14, for instance<br>
a thermocouple, to check the temperature of the container wall.<br>
A plasma 8 is created inside the container 2 by current pulses flowing from the central<br>
electrode 5 that is working in the electric or autoelectromc field emission mode (as<br>
defined in the monograph of S. Krapivma, Plasmachemical processes in engineering,<br>
Chemistry Publ., Leningrad (1981), p. 27) to the grounding electrode 15. The grounding<br>
electrode 15 is arranged and shaped so that it can sustain the amplitude of the applied<br>
electric field and admit the creation of branched plasma discharges consisting of a<br>
superficial network of plasma filaments 16. The amplitude of the applied electric field<br>
must be large enough to ensure discharge initiation by breakdown.<br>
Electrode 5 which also functions as a duct 9 through which the process gas is introduced<br>
into the container can be inclined forming an angle or to the container's axis of<br>
symmetry, so as to favor plasma formation along its inner surface 2. A gas having a<br>
weak ionization energy is used, such as argon, in order to optimize discharge<br>
localization along the container's inner surface.<br>
Referring to Figs 5 and 6, the branched plasma discharge is developed by a current pulse<br>
(I) having a rising flank of duration. so that the plasma inside the filaments of the<br>
branched discharge starts to form and heat up isochorically. The time band designated as<br>
t1 in Fig. 5 corresponds to the phase of isochoric heating of the plasma filaments. For t1<br>
one has the relation: t1 
created, and a is the speed of sound in the non-ionized medium surrounding the<br>
filament. Typically d~ 1 mm and a ~ 3.102 m/s so that t1 
At the end of time t\ the pressure rise inside the filament, which depends on the features<br>
of discharge development, and particularly on the heating of the plasma supplied with<br>
energy by the current, generates a shock wave exciting and ionizing the gas around the<br>
filament. The activation is intense above all in zone 19 between plasma filament 16 and<br>
the surface to be treated 2, on account of the incident wave 17 intersecting with the<br>
wave 18 reflected from the surface to be treated. The current that is initially localized in<br>
this filament, after development of the aforementioned shock waves passes mainly to the<br>
zone 19 that is restricted to the reflected wave 18 within which a cold plasma out of<br>
thermodynamic equilibrium develops which has a very good contact with the surface to<br>
be treated.<br>
The amplitude of the energy developed by the electric current pulse is such that part of<br>
the energy of the incident shock wave is transmitted to the material of the object to be<br>
treated, via a penetrating shock wave 20 which is dissipated in the form of vibrations at<br>
eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated, which can be in the range of audible<br>
frequencies or of ultrasonic frequencies. The presence of vibrations can be controlled<br>
advantageously with the aid of an acoustic sensor 13 in the treatment device. These<br>
acoustic vibrations will subject the atoms of the object to be treated to oscillations<br>
which make them depart from and return to their positions of static equilibrium, and<br>
during their departure create a situation that favors their chemical union with the<br>
particles of the medium that is ionized and activated by the plasma, for instance with<br>
silicon and oxygen atoms during deposition of a SiOx film.<br>
Figure 7 shows records of the vibration frequencies of a PET bottle (0.5 liters) obtained<br>
during the treatment by a HF pulse discharge producing a branched jet of plasma<br>
filaments according to the invention. One sees that the trains of acoustic vibrations<br>
having a relatively large amplitude have frequencies which more particularly are about<br>
6080 Hz and 10,000 Hz.<br>
Particularly in the ultrasonic region, acoustic vibrations applied during the surface<br>
treatment exert a catalyzing role that is similar to an increase in temperature of the<br>
object to be treated. Ultrasonic vibrations have the advantage that the object to be<br>
treated remains relatively cold as compared to traditional plasma treatment processes,<br>
since the energy of the ultrasonic vibrations is dissipated in the volume bordering the<br>
shock wave, rather than locally. Thus, the heating of the object to be treated that results<br>
from dissipation of the waves will be relatively slight.<br>
The current pulses should anyhow be limited in time. The energy set free during current<br>
flow in the plasma, which at first is out of thermodynamic equilibrium, is expended on<br>
one hand for activating the carrier gas particles (for example, O2, O, Si, maybe C, II), on<br>
the other hand for heating the object to be treated, as well as the plasma itself, which<br>
increases in volume. These last-mentioned effects constitute a certain disadvantage for<br>
the surface treatment and should be eliminated. In fact, when films are deposited on the<br>
surface to be treated, the bulk plasma heating favors the formation of powder which will<br>
deposit on the surface to be treated, and contaminate it, resulting for instance in poor<br>
adhesion of the film to the surface to be treated and in poor barrier quality.<br>
Returning to Fig. 5, the time band designated by t2 in Fig. 5 corresponds to a phase of<br>
expansion of the plasma filaments. The current pulse duration 6 is selected such that the<br>
plasma remains cold and develops along the surface to be treated, and that the<br>
temperature of the object to be treated will not rise above its temperature of destruction.<br>
This can be controlled by temperature measurements of the object during or<br>
immediately after its treatment with a temperature sensor, for instance a thermocouple<br>
14 positioned close to or on the object to be treated, as shown in Fig. 3, and connected<br>
to the plasma generation device 4. In an industrial process, the sensor can be employed<br>
in the phase of startup to adjust and calibrate the plasma generation parameters, and<br>
particularly the pulse duration t2 and pulse interval duration t2.<br>
On the other hand, the current pulse duration t2 must be sufficient to activate and<br>
precipitate a maximum number of particles from the plasma-chemically activated<br>
medium onto the surface to be treated, which is verified by evaluating the actual results<br>
of the treatment on a certain number of samples.<br>
As the plasma filaments that trigger the mechanism described above are spaced<br>
relatively far apart, the pulses must be repeated in order to uniformly coat the entire<br>
surface to be treated. The time interval t2 between two pulses should be longer than the<br>
"post-discharge" plasma lifetime t4 (as defined, for instance, in the monograph of A.<br>
Ricard, Plasmas Reactifs, SFV, 1995), and long enough so that the particles that have<br>
precipitated on the surface to be treated and have been brought in contact with the<br>
particles of the surface itself, can attain their final stable (or metastable) state that will<br>
be determinant for the required properties of the surface to be treated, in order tor the<br>
filaments not to return onto the sites of prior filaments when a new pulse is applied.<br>
For instance, during deposition of a polymer film based on the plasma precipitation of a<br>
mixture of activated C, H, and CHy particles, the time interval t3 between the plasma<br>
pulses should be such that between the plasma pulses the polymerization process can be<br>
completed on the surface to be treated. This completion is advantageously accelerated<br>
by the presence of acoustic vibrations.<br>
For plasmas containing compounds such as O2, N2, H2, Si, and C, the time interval<br>
between pulses will preferably be t3 = 1 to 10 ms.<br>
Advantageously, an acoustic vibration, preferably in the region of ultrasonic fre-<br>
quencies, that is being applied to the object to be treated, prior to the plasma treatment,<br>
offers the advantage of promoting the expulsion of foreign gases absorbed in the surface<br>
layers of the surface to be treated. Through the expulsion of these absorbed gases, it can<br>
be avoided that during local heating of the material by the plasma, a flux of these gases<br>
would be created that opposes the flux of activated plasma particles and would prevent<br>
them from reaching the surface to be treated.<br>
Advantageously, by applying an acoustic vibration after the plasma treatment to the<br>
object to be treated one will be able to expel the residual gases and the powder particles<br>
that might have become adsorbed during treatment on the treated surface.<br>
The acoustic vibrations of the object to be treated which airise from the creation of a<br>
branched network of plasma filaments according to the invention can be supplemented<br>
by acoustic, and particularly ultrasonic, vibrations from an external source such as an<br>
ultrasonic vibration generator. The frequency can be selected so as to be equal to one of<br>
the eigenfrequencies of the object to be treated, which can be measured with a vibration<br>
sensor. In this case the resonance effect will substantially improve the quality of the<br>
applied treatment. Other advantageous frequencies exist at which the ultrasonic<br>
vibration of the object to be treated can be amplified, particularly the frequency a/D,<br>
where D is the diameter of the container and a is the speed of sound.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show photographs taken with a high-speed camera of a branched<br>
plasma discharge generated with a device such as described in relation to Figs. 3, 5, and<br>
6. In the case illustrated, the bottle rests on a plate that is grounded and in contact with<br>
an acoustic vibration generator. The parameters for plasma creation used in these<br>
examples are:<br>
in Figs. 4a and 4b,<br><br>
photographic exposure time: 0.5 ms,<br>
vibration frequency of the external vibration generator: ƒ= 120 kHz;<br>
in Fig. 4a,<br>
electric threshold potential U= 15 kV,<br>
process gas: argon;<br>
in Fig. 4b,<br>
electric threshold potential U=10 kV,<br>
process gas: a mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane, oxygen, and argon.<br>
The branched plasma filaments being created move rapidly along the surface to be<br>
treated, and vanish. Each discharge is preceded by a superficial breakdown such as<br>
represented by the voltage peak 53 in Fig. 5, which gives rise to a precursor channel.<br>
The lifetime of these branched filaments corresponds to the pulse frequency of the<br>
current source that creates them. The filament network covers large part of the surface to<br>
be treated, according to the photographs, and the filaments follow the exact shape of the<br>
surface irregularities of this surface, including the bottom.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have realized that in traditional processes the<br>
plasma tends to become detached from the surface of the object to be treated, since the<br>
motion of the object or electrode gives rise to gas motions that perturb the plasma and<br>
particularly the air inflows brought about by the boundary layer of the container wall<br>
which tend to repel the plasma from the surface to be treated. When the plasma moves<br>
away from the surface to be treated, this diminishes or cancels the concentration<br>
gradient of the active particles on the surface to be treated, and thus prevents the surface<br>
treatment, such as deposition of a film. In the present invention, the problem is avoided<br>
by the fact that the duration of the current pulses creating the plasma in the shape of a<br>
branched filament network is selected to be short enough to ensure that the motion of<br>
the surface to be treated is so small relative to the spot occupied by the network that the<br>
pulse duration t2 is smaller than the ratio (div) between the width (d) of a filament and<br>
the speed (v) of motion of the surface to be treated in relation to the plasma. Assuming<br>
that this speed be 1 m/s (a speed that is often realized in practice), and that the width of<br>
a filament is 1 mm, a maximum value of 10-3 s is obtained for t2. The pulse duration t2 is<br>
actually subject to an even stricter condition, viz., the limitation imposed on the<br>
temperature of heating of the surface to be treated. The tests performed while<br>
developing this invention have shown that this requirement limits the pulse duration t2<br>
to a value not in excess of about 3-10-4 s. The high-frequency photographs such as those<br>
of Figs. 4a and 4b show that during this time period, the filaments remain attached to the<br>
surface to be treated, and that no hydrodynamic effect is observed.<br>
For an optimum scanning of the surface to be treated by the branched plasma network,<br>
such as that shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, one can move the plasma filaments further apart<br>
or closer together, in other words, vary the density of the bundle of plasma filaments, by<br>
selecting the shape and position of the grounding electrode 15. In Fig. 3a, for instance,<br>
one sees a branched bundle of low density, while in Fig. 3b one sees a bundle of plasma<br>
filaments highly concentrated on account of having placed an electrode 15' of small<br>
surface area outside, and radially disposed relative to the axis of symmetry of the bottle<br>
underneath the insulating holder 12.<br>
For the plasma to sweep all of the container surface, one can carry out a relative motion<br>
between the grounding electrode and the object to be treated, for instance by rotating the<br>
holder 12 on which the container sits, or by rotating the live or grounding electrode<br>
while keeping the holder at rest, or also by moving a magnetic or electromagnetic field<br>
or generating a hydrodynamic effect in the process gases.<br>
So as to simplify the device, one can advantageously achieve the plasma sweep along<br>
the surface to be treated, by moving the process gas supply nozzle, for instance by<br>
performing a rotation about the axis of axial symmetry of the bottle as shown in Figs. 3a<br>
to 3c. One can also improve the scanning by a treatment device such as shown in Fig.<br>
3c, which has a gas supply device 5' provided with a feeding head 24 having a plurality<br>
of inclined ducts 9a, 9b, 9c forming an angle a with the axis of symmetry of the bottle,<br>
and distributed around this axis of symmetry. The ducts 25 can at the same time serve as<br>
electrodes coupled to the plasma generation device 4. The feeding head 24 can be<br>
mounted so as to be rotating relative to the holder 12 of container 3. The device allows a<br>
plurality of branched plasma jets 8a, 8b, 8c to be generated which are distributed around<br>
the inner surface of this container. Rotating the process gas supply ducts causes the<br>
plasma to be rotated through hydrodynamic and electrostatic effects. The hydrodynamic<br>
effect also improves the evacuation of residual gases after the treatment.<br>
The entire surface of the container can therefore be treated, either by one or several<br>
sweeps of the plasma when the grounded electrode or the live electrode which serves at<br>
once as the process gas supply duct is moved, or by repeated pulses on the entire surface<br>
to be treated, but without motion of the latter.<br>
An important moment in the realization of the process is the feeding of the gas mixture<br>
to the surface to be treated. The gases that bring the molecules for deposition of a film,<br>
an impermeable film for instance, can be mixed with the gas used for plasma formation,<br>
and supplied through the ducts 9, 9a, 9b, 9c in the live electrode, they can be present in<br>
the container 3 prior to the start of surface treatment, or they can be supplied into the<br>
container by a separate source. The nozzle of the live electrode may direct the gases for<br>
film coating downstream of the forming plasma. It is important that the breakdown<br>
voltage in the gas mixture be lower than that of ambient air. For this reason the gas<br>
mixture preferably contains argon. The supply system is designed for the consecutive<br>
utilization of several gas mixtures having different compositions which will allow a<br>
barrier film to be created, for instance, in the form of several layers having different<br>
chemical compositions. The deposition of a barrier film on the inside of a bottle can<br>
advantageously be terminated with the deposition of an organic layer of the type of CxHy<br>
that will prevent foaming of a carbonated liquid subsequently filled into the bottle.<br>
A critical region of the object to be treated, particularly in the case of objects having a<br>
narrow neck such as bottles or the part of the inner surface close to the open end of the<br>
container (for instance of a cylindrical plastic tube), is the inclined or receding pan of<br>
the inner surface close to the neck. It is advantageous in order to ensure an efficient<br>
surface treatment of this part to have ducts 9a, 9b, 9c inclined by an angle a relative to<br>
the axis of axial symmetry of the container or at least the part close to the part of the<br>
neck 26.<br>
In the particular case where the object to be treated is a plastic tube, it turns out to be<br>
important, for instance during a treatment by which a barrier is deposited, not to treat the<br>
end of the tube that is to be closed, since the deposited film may prevent the welding of<br>
this end after filling of the tube by a consumer good. In this case angle a will be so<br>
selected that the gas mixture fed through ducts 9, 9a, 9b, 9c will contact the wall to be<br>
treated, only below the annular surface that should not be treated. In the particular case<br>
where a bottle is treated, it is possible at the end of the operations to only coat the lower<br>
part of the bottle with a polymer layer preventing foaming of the beverage during filling,<br>
while the neck lacks this layer and hence favors foaming. This would cause the beverage<br>
to foam when poured, an effect desired in the case of beer.<br>
By adequate selection of the angle a one can also minimize the accumulation of residual<br>
treatment products, by admitting a circulation of the gases toward the open side of the<br>
container, here the neck. One also can inject the feed gases as a coaxial cone to an<br>
axisymmetric object to be treated, so that the feed gases are uniformly distributed over<br>
all of the surface to be treated. In this case the residual gases are evacuated by a central<br>
evacuating duct along the axis of this cone.<br>
By virtue of the contact between the plasma and the surface to be treated by a process<br>
according to the invention, one can deposit barrier layers, for instance layers containing<br>
SiOx which is cheap and well suited for containers intended for food, by the following<br>
effects. First the gases absorbed in the walls of the object to be treated are desorbed by<br>
the acoustic effect of a shock wave arising with the creation of the plasma and/or<br>
coming from an external source of ultrasonic vibrations, and are thus eliminated from<br>
the wall's surface layer. The plasma might also produce a superficial etching of some<br>
atomic layers liberating chemical bonds which will react with the excited particles in the<br>
plasma, particularly certain particles such as silicon and oxygen fed with the surface<br>
treatment gas. The mechanism is not fully known, but it may be that the SiOx molecules<br>
occupy chemical bonds at the polymer surface and function as crystallization sites for<br>
formation of a barrier layer of SiOx on the surface to be treated.<br>
For the creation of flexible, nonbreaking barrier films having good adhesion to the<br>
walls, it is possible through the present invention to successively deposit layers having<br>
different chemical compositions, and in particular to superimpose layers of SiOx and<br>
CHy nicely adhering to the substrate and to each other.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 8 for treatment of the inner surface 2 of a container 3 of<br>
complex shape, the pulse discharge of plasma in the shape of a plasma filament network<br>
is formed between a live electrode 5 serving at once as a process gas duct and a<br>
grounding electrode 15 that can be moved in three dimensions by a mechanism (not<br>
shown) allowing electrode 15 to run across all of the outer surface of the container so as<br>
to pull a branched plasma filament network across all of the inner surface 2 of the<br>
container.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 9, the surface treatment of a container 3 of complex shape<br>
(for instance a gasoline tank) is carried out as follows. A live electrode 5 supplied by a<br>
current source 4 is situated on the outside of an enclosure 27 of the device. The<br>
container 3 is placed inside the enclosure 27, which is made of insulating material and<br>
ventilated by a flow of air or other gas 28. Two ducts 29, 30 are used to bring the gas<br>
mixture into the tank 3 and to evacuate the residual gases from the tank, respectively.<br>
The tank can be moved and rotated through a mechanism holding the tank (not shown).<br>
The grounded electrode can have the form of an electrically conducting liquid jet 31<br>
coming from an injector 32 supplied by a pump 33. The electrically conducting liquid<br>
34 collecting on the bottom 35 of the enclosure is continuously recirculated into the<br>
system of the grounded electrode. The discharge between said electrodes develops in the<br>
form of a branched plasma filament network 8.<br>
In the embodiments of Figs. 10 and 11, two solutions for the simultaneous treatment of<br>
internal and external sides 2a, 2b of the wall of a container 3 made of insulating material<br>
are shown.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 10, discharges are produced so that the branched plasma<br>
filament networks 8a and 8b are formed in an alternating way to both sides of the wall<br>
while the two electrodes 5a, 5b are connected to opposite poles of the electrical circuit<br>
54 of the plasma generation device 4. The container is placed on a holder 6 made of<br>
insulating material that can be rotated.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 11, the electrical arrangement proposed allows the discharges<br>
to be carried out in the form of branched plasma filament networks 8a, 8b supplied in<br>
parallel. The tank 3 is in this case placed on a holder 12, and the two discharges make<br>
use of one grounded electrode 15.<br>
In these two embodiments, live electrodes 5a, 5b serve as gas ducts. The gas mixtures<br>
sustaining the discharges may differ between the two sides of the container wall so that<br>
deposits having different compositions and properties might be formed.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 12, the discharges are generated such that the branched<br>
network of plasma filaments 8a, 8b are formed on the inner surfaces of the recipients 3a,<br>
3b placed one next to the other. The two electrodes 5a, respectively 5b, arc connected to<br>
opposite poles of the electric circuit 54 of the plasma generation device 4, such that the<br>
plasma filaments 8a, 8b are attracted together by electrostatic forces which help in<br>
applying them against the inner surface of the recipients 3a, respectively 3b.<br>
As in the other embodiments, the recipients 3a, 3b may be placed on rotatable dielectric<br>
supports 12 that also comprise a grounded electrode 15.<br>
A plurality of pairs of containers 3a, 3b supplied by electrodes pairs 5a, 5b connected to<br>
opposite poles of an electrical circuit 54, as shown in Fig. 13, may be treated<br>
successively by means of an electronic or electrical switch 56.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 12 and 13, it may be noted that the formation of<br>
branched network of plasma filaments 8a, 8b against the internal surfaces of the<br>
containers placed one next to the other, is advantageous in view of the good application<br>
of the plasmas against the surface to be treated due to their mutual attraction. The<br>
plasmas thus espouse the interior shape of the containers, thus ensuring a uniform and<br>
effective treatment over the all innersurface of the container.<br>
The process claimed can be put to practice with equipment consisting essentially of two<br>
conveyors feeding and withdrawing the objects to be treated, and a rotating circular tray<br>
at the periphery from where the objects to be treated are moved, each provided with a<br>
system of distribution of the gas mixtures, a current source, appropriate devices for<br>
measurements and checks, and one or more sources of acoustic vibrations, particularly<br>
ultrasonic vibrations, ensuring realization of the process. The sources of acoustic<br>
vibrations may be mounted onto the container bottom holders, so as to enhance the<br>
efficiency of the treatment on the container bottom surface. The current sources can be<br>
arranged to serve groups of objects to be treated.<br>
During its treatment, each of the objects to be treated could be subjected to air cooling<br>
by forced convection to the object's untreated wall, for instance to the side not treated,<br>
when dealing with a container being treated.<br>
In one mode of realization of the invention the objects to be treated could be immersed<br>
into a liquid through which they would be subjected to the uniform action of acoustic<br>
vibrations, and particularly of ultrasonic vibrations, over their entire surface. This could<br>
for instance be bottles or other containers partially immersed into the liquid bath, with<br>
the necks remaining outside, so that the liquid would be in contact with the container's<br>
outer surface, which has the advantage that the container walls can be cooled very<br>
efficiently and the plasma applied for a longer time. On the other hand, when an external<br>
source of vibrations is employed, the liquid allows these vibrations to be more<br>
uniformly distributed over the container walls, and thus to produce more uniform<br>
vibrations on the container's inner surface to be treated.<br>
In order to simplify the electrical connections to the treatment device, the device can be<br>
provided with a system of capacitors through which the high-frequency (HF&gt; electrical<br>
energy is transmitted to the live electrodes without the need for a direct contact.<br>
In the case of deposition of films on containers consisting of transparent, amorphous<br>
material, the treatment device may advantageously include a system of laser beams for<br>
quality control of the film deposited. Such a system will record, either the number of<br>
photons emitted by non-linear effects while the laser beam passes through said film or<br>
the decrease of the flux of primary photons caused by their recombination as a result of<br>
non-linear effects.<br>
In the case of an etching treatment carried out by plasma at an object such as a single-<br>
crystal silicon wafer onto which a microelectronic structure partly protected by masks<br>
consisting of photoresist material is deposited, one can advantageously apply a wave<br>
motion to the object to be treated, in a particular direction such as perpendicularly to the<br>
wafer surface, so as to produce an anisotropic etching. The degree of amsotropy will<br>
depend on the amplitude and frequency of the wave motion imposed upon the surface to<br>
be treated.<br>
When the object to be treated is a metal sheet, a plastic foil, or a textile sheet, then this<br>
object can be subjected to the simultaneous action of a plasma flux scanning the surface<br>
of this object and of a vibrating motion of the object which will intensify the cleaning,<br>
degreasing, etching treatment or film deposition caused by the plasma flux.<br>
A similar and equally efficient realization is feasible when the object to be treated is a<br>
metallic wire, textile fiber, or polymer filament.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention consists in generating the plasma<br>
simultaneously in two spots on the surface of an asymmetrically shaped object to be<br>
treated, for instance a container of large volume and complicated configuration, where<br>
two high-frequency discharges in the form of branched plasma filament networks are<br>
produced between two capacitive electrodes provided with a scanning motion along the<br>
outer surface of the object to be treated.<br>
A mode of plasma generation constituting great practical interest consists in generating<br>
plasma by adiabatic (isentropic) compression. A device for treatment by generation of<br>
such a plasma is shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The treatment device 1 includes an enclosure 36 comrpising a section that is the<br>
chamber of piston 37 and a section containing the seats for the objects to be treated 38, a<br>
solid piston 39, a gas compression device 40 provided with means for rapid expansion,<br>
an acoustic vibration generator 7, an entry duct for the process gas with valve 41, and a<br>
duct for gas evacuation with valve 42. The section with the seats for the objects 38<br>
comprises a portion of side wall 43, a portion of bottom wall 44 fixed to the portion of<br>
side wall via a vacuum seal and vibration damping device 45. Piston 39 is mounted so<br>
as to slide inside the piston chamber 37 of enclosure 36, while the section of the<br>
chamber above the piston can rapidly be filled by high-pressure gas generated by the gas<br>
compression device 40 that is connected to this section of the chamber by a duct 46. An<br>
exit duct 47 with valve 48 allows the gases to be evacuated from the section of the<br>
enclosure above the piston when the piston 39 is lifted back up. The entry and exit duct<br>
41, 42 allows the section with the seats of the objects to be filled with process gas, to<br>
evacuate the gas after treatment, and to fill it again with process gas.<br>
When the piston is at the upper dead center, then the interior of the enclosure is first<br>
evacuated by a vacuum pump (not shown) connected to exit 42, then filled with a<br>
process gas supplied by the entry duct 41. The compression device 40 includes a<br>
compressed-air reservoir connected via an actuating valve with the section of the<br>
enclosure above the piston. The piston 39 is pushed downward by the compressed air<br>
and only stops when at the lower dead center 50.<br>
The dimensions (diameter and height) of the enclosure, the initial process gas pressure,<br>
and the pressure exerted on the piston are so calculated that during its motion from the<br>
upper dead center 49 to the lower dead center 50, the piston compresses the process gas<br>
along the adiabatic curve of Hugogniot.<br>
The plasma is generated by adiabatic compression It pushes the piston back, the piston<br>
returning to its upper dead center 49 while the gas above the piston is evacuated during<br>
its up-stroke via the duct 47. This embodiment has the advantage that the plasma is<br>
generated unformly throughout the treatment space, so that the treatment will be carried<br>
out in a uniform way on all sides of the objects to be treated which are present in the<br>
enclosure.<br>
The dynamics of the compression process is calculated so that a plasma having given<br>
parameters is formed in the treatment zone of the enclosure, and that vibrations are<br>
generated by the external source of vibrations 7 operating preferably at one of the<br>
eigenfrequencies of the objects to be treated, or at a multiple of one of the<br>
eigenfrequencies.<br>
Another mode of plasma generation that may also be of practical interest is the<br>
generation of plasma by a shock wave. A device allowing such a plasma to be generated<br>
is schematically illustrated in Figs. 15a to 15c.<br>
The treatment device 1 according to Fig. 15a comprises an enclosure 36 with a first<br>
section 37 holding compressed gas that is connected via a duct 46 with a valve to a gas<br>
compression device 40, and a section housing the objects to be treated 38, with a<br>
process gas entry duct 41 provided with a valve and a process gas evacuation duct 42<br>
provided with a valve. The section housing the objects tc be treated comprises a portion<br>
of side wall 43 and a bottom portion 44 which are joined via a vacuum seal acting as<br>
vibration absorber 45. The device further comprises an external ultrasonic vibration<br>
generator 7 arranged underneath the bottom portion 44. A removable separating wall 51<br>
can be arranged so as to hermetically separate the section holding the compressed gas 37<br>
from the section housing the objects to be treated 38.<br>
At the start of the treatment process a vacuum pump connected to the evacuating duct<br>
42 empties the section 38 of the enclosure which subsequently is tilled with a process<br>
gas supplied by the entry duct 41. The compression device 40 compresses a process gas<br>
in the section holding the compressed gas 37. Finally the removable wall 51 is abruptly<br>
lifted in order to connect the two enclosure sections 37, 38.<br>
The dimensions (diameter and height) of the enclosure, the initial pressure of the<br>
process gas, the position of the separating wall, the pressure of the compression gas, and<br>
other parameters are so calculated that the process gas compression behind the shock<br>
wave occurs according to the adiabatic curve of Poisson, The dynamics of the<br>
compression process produced by the incident and reflected shock wave is calculated in<br>
such a way that a plasma of given parameters is formed in the zone of the object to be<br>
treated. The object 3 is subjected to the plasma-chemical action of the plasma created<br>
behind the reflected shock wave 52', the plasma resulting from the twofold compression<br>
by the incident wave 52 and the reflected wave 52'. Part of the energy of the incident<br>
shock wave 52 is absorbed by the object to be treated 3, in the form of a shock wave 52"<br>
propagating inside the object at the speed of sound, which is rather higher that the speed<br>
of sound in the plasma. The wave inside the object is reflected at the opposite wall 26,<br>
and thus performs a forth-and-back motion becoming dissipated in the form of acoustic<br>
vibrations.<br>
These vibrations of the surface of the object to be treated provoke an intensification of<br>
the plasma-chemical reactions between the plasma and the particles of the surface to be<br>
treated 2a. One can boost the amplitude of the vibrations by an external source of<br>
vibrations 7 emitting for instance a frequency close to or identical with one of the<br>
eigenfrequencies of the object or a multiple of this frequency.<br>
However, the frequency of this external vibration can be selected so as to correspond,<br>
neither to the vibration frequency of the shock wave in the object to be treated nor to an<br>
eigenfrequency of the object to be treated.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, another embodiment is shown for forming a plasma in a reactor 36<br>
in which gas and vapors Q1 and Q2 are introduced by the entry ports 41 The<br>
decomposition of the gas in the plasma forms clusters and powders, in particular nano-<br>
powders, whereby the degree of structuration, the form, and the quantity is determined<br>
by the simultaneous action of the plasma and ultrasonic vibrations. The vibrations are<br>
for example transmitted to the reactor by an ultrasonic generator 7, or generated in the<br>
chamber 36 by current pulses in the plasma as described previously, such that the front<br>
of development of the plasma has the characteristics described in relation to Fig. 5.<br>
In this manner, for example, nano-powders of SiO2 in the form of monocrystals having<br>
an average dimension of around 20 nm with a dispersion of ±20%, have been produced<br>
from the decomposition of hexamethyldisiloxane in a process gas comprising<br>
argon+oxygen. The productivity of the method was increased 35-fold, all other<br>
parameters being equal, by including an acoustic vibration of 45 kHz frequency (2 kW<br>
power) in the high frequency electrical discharge (HF) plasma (power 45kW, diameter<br>
of the plasma flux: 35 mm).<br>
In the device according to Fig. 16. the ultrasonic generator 7 comprises an ultrasound<br>
transmitter 58 mounted coaxially within the chamber 36, which in this example has a<br>
cylindrical shape, such that the powder particles are produced and treated in the annular<br>
space between the ultrasonic transmitter 58 and the wall of the chamber 36. The device<br>
may further comprise a cooling circuit 60 around a portion of the chamber 36 and<br>
having entry and exit ports 62, 64 for the circulation of a cooling liquid. The plasma 8 is<br>
created in a portion 66 of the chamber around which the electrodes 5 connected to a<br>
current source 4 are placed, for example a high frequency current source, for the<br>
generation of plasma in the portion 66 of the chamber, either by capacitive or inductive<br>
effect. If the external acoustic generator is supplied, the plasma may be created in the<br>
chamber by conventional means. However, in the absence of an external vibration<br>
generator, the acoustic vibrations may be generated by the process of generation of the<br>
plasma in pulses respecting the conditions described in relation to Fig. 5.<br>
The device of Fig. 16 may also be used for the treatment of powder nuclei or grains,<br>
which for example may be introduced with the gas mixture Q1, Q2 in order to form<br>
composite powder grains. The plasma activates the atoms and molecules of the gas<br>
mixture that are in contact with the powder nuclei in order to form homogeneous atomic<br>
or molecular films or layers around the nuclei. The acoustic vibrations undulate the<br>
plasma ions or the grain nuclei, or both, such that the relative undulating movement<br>
between the nuclei surface and the plasma ions catalyzes the deposition process. The<br>
powder 70 thus produced or treated is collected in a collector 68 arranged under the<br>
outlet tube 36.<br>
Another variant of the present invention comprises imposing an acoustic vibration for<br>
surface etching by plasma. The object to be treated is for example a semi-conductor<br>
plaque such as a mono-crystalline silicium plaque covered with a structure comprising<br>
masks, as commonly found in semi-conductor technology. The plasma is preferably an<br>
atmospheric plasma. The silicium plaque is wounded on a support and arranged to be<br>
subjected to an atmospheric plasma jet, in which etching gases, such as CF4 are injected.<br>
The support is subjected to an ultrasound vibration perpendicular to the plaque, for<br>
example at a frequency of 15 kHz.<br>
Experiments have shown that on application of the ultrasonic vibration, cleaning may be<br>
effected in an anisotropic manner in the sense that the etching speed VII in the direction<br>
parallel to the vibrational movement (i.e. perpendicular to the surface of the silicium<br>
plaque) is superior to the etching speed in the perpendicular direction v. By varying the<br>
power P of the vibration between 0.1 and 2 kW, it was possible to obtain a ratio vII/v<br>
varying between 1.2 and 30. This ratio increases by a factor of 1.5 with an increase in<br>
the frequency of 15 to 45 kHz.<br>
The plasma treatment process of the present invention may advantageously be used for<br>
cleaning, or etching, or scaling metallic sheets or wires. For example, an aluminum<br>
sheet passing through a plasma curtain may be cleaned of its oil or grease layer<br>
remaining after rolling. The application of an acoustic vibration intensifies the<br>
aforementioned treatment in a significant manner For example, in a practical<br>
experiment, a virtual complete cleaning was obtained for a linear power density of<br>
1kW/cm of plasma for a sheet velocity through the plasma of 3 m/sec. By applying an<br>
ultrasonic vibration to the aluminum foil through the support or roller in contact with<br>
the foil (v = 45 kHz, P = 0.1 kW/cm), it was possible to reduce the electric power by<br>
half (that is 0.5 kW/cm) to achieve the same cleanliness results.<br>
In the case of treatment of an internal or external surface of a hollow body of<br>
asymmetric shape, having for example the shape of a large volume container with<br>
complex configuration, it is possible to generate the plasma in the form of a branched<br>
network at two regions on the surface of the body to be treated, for example by two high<br>
frequency discharges in the form of a branched network of plasma filaments between<br>
two capacitive electrodes that sweep along the outer surface of the body.<br>
By way of example, in a practical experiment, the internal surface of an automobile fuel<br>
reservoir made of a single layer polyethylene, was covered with a barrier film with the<br>
aid of high frequency plasma discharges at 13.56 MHz. The plasma discharges in the<br>
form of a branched network of filaments, were created in a gas mixture of argon, oxygen<br>
and HMDS. The average power of the discharge was 5 kW. In 60 seconds, the interior<br>
surface of the container was covered with a film of SiO2 of 0.1 µm thickness,<br>
representing a barrier improvement factor for hydrocarbon molecules of around 1000.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of realization of the process according to the invention are given<br>
hereafter.<br>

Example 3.<br>
Deposition of a silicon oxide film (SiO2) by decomposition of HDMS in an<br>
atmospheric plasma in the interior of the container (PET bottles) under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
Frequency (v) of the undulations (exterior source of ultrasound with different<br>
energy densities) applied to the container during the plasma treatment :<br>
v = 3.101 kHz.<br>
- Amplitude (1) of the undulations (measured by a high speed camera: 10<br>
frames/sec) :<br>
1= 1/v. V(E/p)<br>
where p is the density of the treated material.<br>
Increase of the temperature (AT) of the container wall following an atmospheric-<br>
plasma treatment (measured with an infrared pyrometer) :<br>
?T= 10K.<br>
In these conditions, the energy density (E) of the undulating movement is :<br>
E und = ½ p2V2<br>
The thermal energy density (Et) communicated to the object hy the plasma and<br>
corresponding to a temperature of ?T de 10K is<br>
ET= pc?T<br>
where c is the thermal capacitance of the material.<br>
The ratio (R) of the above values is : R= E und / E1 = ½l2v2/ c?T.<br>
Following the undulating regimes (1) imposed on the process, we have :<br>
Table N°l :<br>
The result obtained by this experiment allows us to conclude that in the case of a film<br>
deposition by atmospheric plasma, the energy density of the undulating movement is<br>
superior to around one hundredth of the thermal energy density communicated to the<br>
body to be treated by the plasma. In a general manner, this implies that the application<br>
of an undulating movement only becomes effective when its intensity is such that the<br>
energy density of this movement is significant in relation to the increase in thermal<br>
energy of the body to be treated, the latter being proportional to the increase of the<br>
temperature of the body before and/or during treatment. The thermal energy may be<br>
communicated to the body to be treated by a heat source, in particular the heat source<br>
provided by the plasma itself.<br>
In this example, 1e minimum ratio R of the energy densities, for which an undulating<br>
movement becomes effective, has been found to be around one over a hundred.<br>
Considering the complex nature of the interaction between the surface that is on the one<br>
hand undulating, and on the other hand heated, with the plasma, it is possible that the<br>
aforementioned ratio is around one hundredth for the particular process of depositing a<br>
silicium oxide film, but different for other processes, for example for etching, activation<br>
or sterilization of surfaces. In a general manner, it should thus be retained that the word<br>
"significant" means that the energy density of the undulating movement should be a<br>
significant fraction of the thermal energy density, probably above one thousandth. The<br>
example shows that the actual value of the ratio exists but needs to be determined for<br>
each particular situation.<br>
Example 4<br>
During the film deposition treatment mentioned in Example 3, the thickness of<br>
the boundary layer concerning the diffusion of particles (Si) towards the wall<br>
surface to be treated, was estimated on the basis of estimations of the average<br>
temperature of the plasma based on spectroscopic data mentioned in the article:<br>
A. Kakliougin, P. Koulik, et al., "HF Atmospheric Plasma Sterilization of<br>
Dielectric Containers Inside Surface" CIP 2001, published by SVF; 1st Edition<br>
May 2001, p. 28. According to these estimations, the thermal speed (VY ) of<br>
diffusing particles was estimated at vT~ 103 m/s. The concentration nT / npl of the<br>
diffusing particles of Si was measured by flow-meters and was equal to 10-5<br>
(ratio of the particle density of Si to the total density of plasma particles), and the<br>
effective section of the diffusing particles was evaluated at 10-18 m2 according to<br>
Braun (S. Braun, Basic Processes in Gas Discharges. Cambridge, MTI, 12,<br>
1959).<br>
The duration of treatment by plasma was ?t = 30sec.<br>
In these conditions, the thickness 5 of the boundary layer for the regimes<br>
described in the preceding article is calculated according to the formula : d == vT .<br><br>
where nsol is the density of particles of the deposited layer (~ 1028m-3), where the<br>
thickness is A, and Q is the effective section of the diffusing particles.<br>
According to the undulating regimes imposed in the process, we have :<br>
These results show that when the amplitude of the undulating movement is<br>
superior to the thickness of the boundary layer between the plasma and the object<br>
to be treated, we obtain, in these experimental conditions, a layer of silicium<br>
oxide of measurable thickness (in other words, the process is effective).<br>
This result implies that the undulating movement applied to the surface to be<br>
treated is effective, once it provokes a turbulent plasma, the latter substantially<br>
intensifying the molecular exchange between the plasma and the surface to be<br>
treated, accompanied, for example, by film deposition as mentioned in this<br>
example.<br>
