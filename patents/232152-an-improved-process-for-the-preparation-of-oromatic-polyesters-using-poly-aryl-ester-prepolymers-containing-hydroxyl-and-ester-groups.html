				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aromatic polyesters. The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aromatic polyester is based on dialkyl esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acids and dihydric phenols. The invention more particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of high molecular weight (Mn 12,000-15,000) aromatic polyester.<br>
Aromatic polyesters are a class of polymers generally made from bisphenol(s) and aromatic diacid(s) particularly mixtures of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid. These polyesters are high performance transparent thermoplastics with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties. They are processed by injection molding, extrusion and film forming technique for its conversion to different types of useful products.<br>
Amorphous polyesters are generally prepared by melt polymerization. One such melt polymerization is the diacetate process. in the diacetate process, a dihydric phenol is converted to its diester derivative which is then reacted with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid to yield aromatic polyester.<br>
In  this   context   references  may be  made	to  the<br>
following   literature  :  U.  S.   Pat.   Nos.	4,374,239;<br>
4,386,186;   4,330,668;  4,485,230.<br>
Aromatic   polyesters  by  diacetate process	have   a<br>
endency to be coloured which makes them unsuitable for<br>
many applications. Another problem associated with pro<br>
duction of aromatic polyesters by	diacetate<br>
process is the formation of carboxylic acid as a by<br>
product, which is corrosive and requires special material<br>
for reactor construction.<br>
German offen DE 3,824,069 describes a variation of the diacetate process. In this process aromatic polyester is produced by reacting dialkyl esters of aromatic dicarbox-ylic acids with bisphenol-A diacetate in presence of a catalyst. Methyl acetate comes out as a by-product, however, it cannot be recycled in the process.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,908 describes a process for the preparation of aromatic polyester by melt polymerization using alcoholysis route. This process comprises of two steps, the first step comprises of preparation of polyester prepolymer having intrinsic viscosity in the range of 0. 10 to 0.30 dL/g by reacting dimethyl esters of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid with bisphenol-A in the melt phase in presence of solvent and catalyst. The second step consists of melt polymerization of purified polyarylate prepolymer in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The drawback of the melt polymerization processes is that melt viscosities increase dramatically with increase in molecular weight, causing problems in agitation and heat transfer and consequent impact on product quality and process economics.<br>
Solid state po1ycondensation is a commonly practised technique to obtain high molecular weight crystalline polymers such as poly(ethy1ene terephthalate), nylon-6,6 etc. In this technique polycondensation is generally carried out by heating semicrystal1ine prepolymer. in a stream of inert gas or under vacuum at a temperature just below the polymer melting temperature. The salient features of solid state polycondensation are (1) The prepolymer is handled in powdered (or chips) form, thus the solid state polycondensation process requires a very simple reactor design, (25 The reaction temperatures employed are very much lower than that in melt polycondensation, hence a clean reaction is observed devoid of side reactions or thermal degradation, (3) Very high molecular weight polycondensates can be prepared, which are inaccessible through a melt process.<br>
The prior literature reports few variations of the diacetate process for the preparation of aromatic polyester by a solid state polycondensation of prepolymer.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,684,766 discloses a process for copolyester by reacting bisphenol-A diacetate with terephth-alic acid and isophthalic acid. The resulting prepolymer was contacted with a crystallization medium. The crystallized prepolymer was heated in a fluidized bed, at a temperature below the melting point for certain period to achieve a copolyester having inherent viscosity of 0.50 or more.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,314,051 describes a process for preparing   crystalline prepolymer  by reacting at least  one<br>
diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid and then heating the prepolymer below its melting point to form a crystalline polyester having a reduced viscosity of 0.45 to 1.20 dL/g.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,546 describes a process for the preparation of aromatic polyester from a prepolymer prepared by reacting bisphenol-A, acetic anhydride and atleast one aromatic dicarboxylic acid. The prepolymer is polycondensed under agitation to form a powdery solid which is further polymerized until the desired molecular weight is  achieved.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,478 discloses a process for the preparation of aromatic polyester having low colour wherein bisphenol-A, acetic anhydride, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid are melt polymerized to form a prepolymer. The prepolymer is then treated with a crystallization medium and then further polymerized in the solid state by heating the prepolymer below its melting point under an inert gas flow.<br>
The prior art solid state polycondensation processes use prepolymers prepared by acidolysis of bisphenol-A diacetate by terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid. These prepolymers contain acetate and carboxylic end groups which react further under solid state po1ycondesation conditions yielding high molecular weight polyester with the formation of acetic acid as a by-product. The disadvantage of the above process is that it is not easy to remove<br>
acetic acid. Furthermore, acetic acid handling requires equipments with special materials of construction. Furthermore presence of traces of acetic acid in the product may affect the thermal stability of the polyester.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved  process  for  the preparation  of  aromatic  polyesters employing poly(ary1 ester) prepolymer containing dialkyl and ester groups.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of aromatic polyesters by the use of poly(ary1 ester) prepolymer which contains hydroxyl and ester end groups employing solid state poly condensation yielding high molecular weight (tin = 12,000 - 15, 000) aromatic        polyester.<br>
In the present process methyl alcohol is formed as  a by product. Since methyl alcohol is a low boiling  compound  it  can be   removed conveniently and  efficiently  from   the   reactor. The recovered methyl alcohol can be  effectively used.<br>
Poly(ary1 ester) Prepolymers	containing hydroxyl and<br>
ester groups have not been used in	the prior art for prepara<br>
tion of aromatic polyester by	solid state polyconden-<br>
sation        technique.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of high molecular weight aromatic polyester overcoming the drawbacks of hitherto known processes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of aromatic polyesters using poly (aryl ester) prepolymers containing hydroxyl and ester groups which comprises;<br>
a)	melt polymerising dialkyl esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acid such as herein described with aromatic bisphenol as herein described in presence of a catalyst selected from metals of group IVB, metal alkoxides and group IVA metals and their derivatives such as dibutyl tin diesters, tin phenoxide, silicon phenoxide in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 wt% of prepolymer to obtain an amorphous poly(aryl ester) prepolymer containing hydroxyl and ester groups,<br>
b)	crystallizing the poly (aryl ester) prepolymer as obtained in step a) by suspending in a diluent as herein described, heating at a reflux temperature in the range of 60-150°C for a period of 2 to 4 hours,<br>
c)	separating the crystallized poly(aryl ester) prepolymer by known methods, drying the said crystallized prepolymer at 70-80°C at vacuum 1 mm Hg,<br>
d)	heating the crystallized poly(aryl ester) prepolymer initially at atmospheric pressure and then in the pressure range of 0.1 to 10mm Hg at a temperature in the range of 200-25 0°C or by heating in a fluidized bed at a temperature below the melting point of the polymer in an inert gas,<br>
e)	cooling the poly (aryl ester) to room temperature to obtain desired product.<br>
During the heating stage, the poly(arylester) prepolymer undergoes further polymerization in the solid state with an increase in molecular weight.<br>
The process of the present invention thus obviates the drawbacks of the prior art processes for the preparation the drawbacks of the prior art processes for the preparation poly(aryl ester) from dialkyl esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic bisphenols.<br>
In one the embodiments of the present invention the prepolymer suitable for the process is generally amorphous and has an intrinsic viscosity of approximately 0.20 - 0.30 dL /g corresponding to number average molecular weight in the range of 2,800 - 6,000.<br>
In another embodiment of the     invention,	the<br>
poly  (aryl ester)      prepolymer      can       be prepared	by   melt polyconden-<br>
sation process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,908 by reacting esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acids with aromatic bisphenol(s) in presence of  a catalyst.<br>
These poly(ary1ester) prepolymers do not show any crystalline peak either in Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) or X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hence termed  amorphous.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the dialkyl esters employable may be dimethyl terephtha1 ate, dimethyl isophthalate and mixtures thereof, as well as 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid esters and alkyl substituted homologs of such dicarboxylic acid esters wherein the alkyl group contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
In yet another embodiment the bisphenol employable may be bisphenol-A, halo substituted bisphenol-A, alkyl-substituted bisphenol-A, hydroquinone, resorcinol and various types of other polyphenols.<br>
In yet another embodiment the catalyst employed may include alkoxides of Gt IVB metals and derivatives of Gr 1VA metals.<br>
The diluents used can be chosen from organic compounds such as ethyl acetate, acetone, toluene or xylene or combinations thereof or the like. The diluent may be any solvent that will promote crystallization but not dissolve the poly(ary1 ester) prepolymer. The heterogeneous mixture of poly(aryIester) prepolymer and the diluent   is   then  heated  to    the    respective    refluxing<br>
temperatures. The optimum temperature and time for crystallization will depend upon the nature of the diluent. Subsequently   the   diluent  is  removed  by   distillation  and  the<br>
o product is dried in vacuum at  70 - 80 C  for  3-4  hours.  The<br>
dried  poly(ary1 ester) prepolymers  show   appreciable   crystal-<br>
linity   as  observed  by the appearance of crystalline   melting<br>
o peaks  in  DSC in  the  range of  190  to 250 C.   The   catalyst<br>
employed  may be dibutyltin diesters, tin   phenoxide,    silicon<br>
phenoxide etc. The  amount of catalyst  employed  may  be in  the<br>
range of  0.05  to  0.50 weight  percent  based on  prepoiymer.<br>
The crystallized po1y(ary1ester) prepoiymer may be post-polymer ized in solid state at different pressures ranging from atmospheric pressure to sub-atmospheric pressure. Generally 1 atm (760 mm, Hg) is maintained during the initial  phase  and subsequently  the pressure is reduced to  1.0<br>
to   0.1 mm,  Hg  or even  lower.  The  temperature of the  reac-<br>
o tion  may be in   the range of 170 - 240 C.<br>
The  heating  time may be  between 8-15 hours,   depending   on<br>
the molecular weight range desired.<br>
Alternatively the crystallized poly(ary1 ester) prepoiymer • can be heated in a fluidized bed at a temperature below the melting point of the polymer using a hot inert gas for a period of time which is sufficient to achieve an intrinsic viscosity of 0.60 dL/g. The inert gas can be chosen amongst nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide or helium.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below by examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention, in any manner.<br>

The aain advantages of the invention are :<br>
The present process uses the po1y(arylester) prepolymer prepared by alcoholysis of aromatic bisphenol(s) by dialkyl esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acid(s). Unlike the poly(ary1ester) prepolymer prepared by acidolysis of bisphenol(s) diacetate by aromatic dicarboxylic acid(s), the poly(ary1ester) prepolymer prepared by alcoholysis route is free from residual by-product as the by-product (methyl alcohol) being the low boiling compound is removed efficiently and conveniently. Hence allows the production of better quality prepolymer. High molecular weight polyesters can be produced by solid state polycon densation of these poly(ary1ester) prepolymers without any need of operations    such   as premelting,  efficient  agitation    etc.<br>
Aromatic polyester melts have high viscosities and hence cannot be agitated easily to provide uniform heating and local over heating cause the melt to degrade. On the contrary, solid state polymerization does not require agitation hence there is no danger of polymer degradation and consequently poly(ary1ester) with good colour is obtained. Poly(ary1ester)s of any desired molecular weights can be produced for end applications such as injection molding or extrusion  simply by controlling the time temperature profile.<br><br><br><br>
