FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of 3G-WLAN interworking systems. Further, this invention relates to the tunnel authentication procedure in the 3G-WLAIM interworking system. This invention provides a method of deriving new keys for IKEv2 mutual authentication by using the keys derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishment procedures. This invention encompasses method for using the existing valid keys to derive new keys for subsequent tunnel establishment procedures over a 3G-WLAN interworking system. More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method for optimizing tunnel authentication procedure over a 3G-WLAN interworking system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The 3GPP (http://www.3gpp.org) specification TS33.234, which deals with the ongoing 3GPP work related to security of 3G-WLAN interworking, provides a system description for tunnel establishment mechanism between 3G- WLAN UE and Packet Data Gateway (PDG) over a 3G-WLAN interworking system, as depicted in Figure 1.<br>
Depending on internal configuration, the UE initiates W-APN resolution and tunnel establishment with a PDG in PLMN, as illustrated in Figure 2 wherein the:<br>
1.  UE performs a DNS query to resolve W-APN. The DNS response will contain<br><br>
one or more IP addresses of equivalent PDG's that support the requested W-APN in the PLMN according to standard DNS procedures. If the PLMN does not support the W-APN, then the DNS query returns a negative response. 2. UE selects a PDG from the list received in step 1, and the establishment of an end-to-end tunnel is performed between the UE and this PDG. The UE includes the W-APN and the user identity in the initial tunnel establishment request. The PDG contacts the AAA server for authentication the UE and authorization of the requested service. After the successful authentication, the AAA server passes the key materials to the PDG to establish the security associations with the UE. The PDG and WAG exchange information (via the AAA Server and Proxy) in order to establish a filtering policy to allow the forwarding of tunneled packets to the PDG.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Tunnel establishment procedures are provided in the current 3GPP system, as in TS 33.234 and other related specifications. Currently IKEv2 is used to dynamically establish IPsec SAs between the UE and the PDG. IKEv2 mandates mutual authentication between the peers. For IKEv2 mutual authentication in 3G-WLAN interworking scenario, the PDG uses public key certificate to authenticate to the UE, while UE uses EAP-AKA to authenticate to the PDG. As a result, the procedure need minimum of 6 messages between UE and PDG and 4 additional messages between PDG to 3GPP AAA server exchanged to perform IKE_AUTH within IKEv2.<br><br>
The number of message exchanges combining with public key cryptographic computation imposes heavy burdens on both devices and network traffic for subsequent tunnel establishment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to optimize the subsequent tunnel authentication procedure in a 3G WLAN interworking environment.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide the mechanism to derive new keys for IKEv2 mutual authentication with out performing complete authentication procedure but by using the keys derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishment procedures.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide intimation to the AAA server to derive the new key for IKEv2 mutual authentication without performing the EAP authentication procedure and by using the keys derived during the previous authentication procedure for the new tunnel establishment procedure.<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanism to derive the new key called Tunnel Session Key (TSK) for IKEv2 mutual authentication, by using EMSK derived during the previous authentication procedure and other parameters.<br><br>
identity, it checks whether the identity is from an l-WLAN subscriber, if so then AAA server may send a notification request. The Notification request is to know whether 3GPP IP Access is performed consecutively. This Notify request payload is included in the EAP Request ANY Identity message.<br>

7.	The UE receives the EAP Request ANY Identity message.<br>
8.	Then the UE includes the Notify response intimating whether the 3GPP IP Access is performed consecutively in the EAP Response ANY Identity message.<br>
9.	Then the AAA server starts the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA procedure and authenticates the UE<br>
10.	After authenticating the UE, the AAA server derives the TSK key and stores it.<br>
The UE initiate the tunnel establishment procedure.<br>
11.	The UE and the PDG negotiate IKE_SA in steps 11 and 12.<br><br>
â– 4<br>
The invention also incorporates the mechanism by which the UE intimate the AAA server to derive the new key for IKEv2 mutual authentication by using the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishment procedures.<br>

"WLAN Direct IP Access" authentication procedure.<br>
2.2. Intimation of the "WLAN 3GPP IP Access" during the "WLAN Direct IP Access" authentication to the AAA server, to derive TSK immediately.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a method for providing the optimized IKEv2 mutual authentication  keys generation for tunnel establishment over a  3G WLAN<br><br>
interworking system.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a method by which the UE intimate the AAA server to derive the TSK for IKEv2 mutual authentication by using the EMSK derived during the previous authentication procedure, for the tunnel establishment request.<br>
The invention incorporates a mechanism to deriving the TSK by using the EMSK derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishments over a 3G-WLAN interworking system.<br>
1. The system in the present invention comprises of a 3G-WLAN UE establishing multiple end to end tunnels towards the PDG over the 3GPP specified interface. During the tunnel establishment procedure, AAA will generate new keys without performing the full authentication procedure or fast authentication procedure, provided if the UE is already authenticated and the derived keys are valid. The parameters used in generating the TSK are:<br>
TSK = prf{EMSK, W-APN, Length of the Key}<br>
or alternatively TSK = prf{EMSK, "W-APN", Identity, Length of the Key)}<br><br><br><br>
2. When a 3G-WLAN UE request for tunnel establishment towards the PDG, it may intimate the AAA server to use TSK, this scenario can be considered in two cases:<br>
2.1. Intimating the AAA server to derive and use the TSK during subsequent tunnel establishment requests. This can be achieved by as shown in Figure 3:<br>
1.  In step 1 and 2 the UE and the PDG negotiate IKE_SA.<br>
3.	The UE may directly derive TSK and use it to calculate the AUTH. The<br>
UE includes the AUTH payload within the IKE_AUTH request message<br>
and send it to the PDG.<br>
4.	When PDG receives the IKE_AUTH request message from the UE with<br><br>
AUTH payload, the PDG will request the AAA server through Access Request message to derive the TSK, if the UE is pre-authenticated.<br>
5.	When the AAA server receives the PDG request, then the AAA server derives the TSK, if the UE is pre-authenticated.<br>
6.	AAA server passes the TSK to the PDG through Access Accept message.<br>
7.	The PDG using the TSK, verify the AUTH Payload send by the UE and<br>
.    calculates the AUTH payload using certificate or alternatively using TSK.<br>
Then the PDG send the IKE_AUTH response message including the AUTH payload to the UE.<br>
When the UE receives the IKE__AUTH response message, it verifies the AUTH payload send by the PDG using PDG's certificate or alternatively using TSK and establishes the IPsec SA.<br>
8.	Alternatively to steps 3, the UE may intimate the PDG to use TSK by including the Notify payload of IKEv2 or Vendor ID payload of IKEv2 with the AUTH payload in the IKE_AUTH request message. AUTH payload is calculated using the derived TSK as described in step 3.<br>
9.	Alternatively to step 4, the PDG may include new Diameter/Radius AVP<br><br>
or the Vendor ID AVP of Diameter/Radius to intimate the AAA server to derive the TSK using the previous authentication keys.<br>
Remaining steps 10, 11 and 12 are similar to the steps 5, 6 and 7 as explained above respectively. Even if UE is directly accessing "WLAN 3GPP IP Access", the AAA Server can realize to derive and use the TSK.<br>
2.2. Intimation of the PS access during the "WLAN Direct IP Access" authentication (WLAN access authentication) to the AAA server, to derive TSK immediately. This can be achieved by as shown in Figure 4:<br>
1.	A connection is established between the UE and the WLAN AN.<br>
2.	WLAN AN sends an EAP Request Identity message to the UE.<br>
3.	The UE sends EAP Response message and optionally may piggy-back the option of using PS service into the identity response after a null character. Alternatively to piggy-back the option, the UE may use the "expanded payload" (i.e., vendor ID) of EAP, to intimate that the 3GPP IP Access is performed consecutively.<br>
4.	The response is relayed by the WLAN to the AAA server.<br>
5.	After receiving the EAP Request Identity, AAA server send EAP Request<br><br>
ANY Identity message to the UE.<br>
Alternatively to the step 3 options of piggy-back of PS service information or inclusion of expanded payload, When the AAA server receives the identity, it checks whether the identity is from an l-WLAN subscriber, if so then AAA server may send a notification request. The Notification request is to know whether 3GPP IP Access is performed consecutively. This Notify request payload is included in the EAP Request ANY Identity message.<br>
6.	The WLAN AN relays the EAP Request ANY Identity message.<br>
7.	The UE receives the EAP Request ANY Identity message.<br>
8.	Then the UE includes the Notify response intimating whether the 3GPP IP Access is performed consecutively in the EAP Response ANY Identity message.<br>
9.	Then the AAA server starts the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA procedure and authenticates the UE<br>
10.	After authenticating the UE, the AAA server derives the TSK key and stores it.<br><br>
The UE initiate the tunnel establishment procedure.<br>
11. The UE and the PDG negotiate IKE_SA in steps 11 and 12.<br>
13.	The UE directly derive TSK and use it to calculate the AUTH and include in the IKE_AUTH request message.<br>
14.	When PDG receives the IKE_AUTH request message from the UE with AUTH payload, the PDG will request the AAA server through Access Request message to derive the TSK, if the UE is pre-authenticated.<br>
15.	AAA server passes the TSK to the PDG through Access Accept message.<br>
16.	The PDG using the TSK, verify the AUTH Payload send by the UE and calculates the AUTH payload using certificate or alternatively using TSK and sends the IKE_AUTH response to the UE. The UE receives the IKE_AUTH response message and verifies the AUTH payload send by the PDG and then establishes the IPsec SA.<br>
17.	Alternatively to step 13, the UE may intimate the PDG to use TSK by including the Notify payload of IKEv2 or Vendor ID payload of IKEv2 with AUTH payload in the IKE_AUTH request message. AUTH payload is calculated using the derived TSK as described in step 3.<br><br>
18. Alternatively to step 14, t he PDG may include new Diameter/Radius AVP or the Vendor ID AVP of Diameter/Radius to intimate the AAA server to derive the TSK using the previous authentication keys.<br>
Remain steps 19 and 20 are similar to the steps 15 and 16 respectively.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>

23.	A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein When PDG receives the IKE_AUTH request message from the UE with AUTH payload, the PDG request the AAA server through Access Request message to derive the TSK, if the UE is pre-authenticated.<br>
24.	A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein AAA server passes the TSK to the PDG through Access Accept message.<br>
25.	A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein the PDG using the TSK, verify the AUTH Payload send by the UE and calculates the AUTH payload using certificate or alternatively using TSK and sends the IKE_AUTH response to the UE where the UE receives the IKE_AUTH response message and verifies the AUTH payload send by the PDG and then establishes the IPsec SA.<br>
26.	A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein UE intimate the PDG to use TSK by including the Notify payload of IKEv2 or Vendor ID payload of IKEv2 with AUTH<br><br>
payload in the IKE_AUTH request message where AUTH payload is calculated using the derived TSK.<br>
27.	A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein the PDG include new Diameter/Radius AVP or the Vendor ID AVP of Diameter/Radius to intimate the AAA server to derive the TSK using the previous authentication keys.<br>
28.	A system for optimizing tunnel authentication procedure over a 3G-WLAN interworking system comprising:<br><br>
(a)	means for deriving new keys for IKEv2 mutual authentication with out performing complete authentication procedure but by using the keys derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishment procedures;<br>
(b)	means for providing intimation to the AAA server to derive the new key for IKEv2 mutual authentication without performing the EAP authentication procedure and by using the keys derived during the previous authentication procedure for the new tunnel establishment procedure;<br>
(c)	means for deriving the new key called Tunnel Session Key (TSK) for IKEv2 mutual authentication, by using EMSK derived during the previous authentication procedure and other parameters; and<br>
(d)	UE intimating the AAA server to derive the new key for IKEv2 mutual authentication by using the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) derived during the previous authentication procedure for the subsequent tunnel establishment procedures.<br><br>
29.	A method for optimizing tunnel authentication procedure over a 3G-WLAN<br>
interworking system substantially described particularly with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
30.	A system for optimizing tunnel authentication procedure over a 3G-WLAN<br>
interworking system substantially described particularly with reference to the<br>
