Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel thiozolyl acetic acid derivatives.   The reactive<br>
thioester derivatives are useful as intermediate for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics having the formula (II). In addition, the present invention also relates to a process for preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics using the said thioester derivatives.<br><br>
Background Art<br>
Acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, amide etc. are reported in the chemical literature for activation of carboxylic acid of formula (IV). Activation in the form of acid chloride required protection and deprotection of NH2 group.<br><br>
Activation of acid (IV) is reported by SO2CI2/DMF in US patent 5,856,502 and SOCI2/DMF in US patent 5,037,988. These processes suffer the limitation of using harmful and pungent smelling chemicals like SOCI2, SO2CI2 along with solvents like benzene, toluene, etc. and stringent conditions required for carrying out the reactions at commercial scale.<br>
In US patent No.4,576,749 and. 4,548,748 the acid of formula (IV) have also been activated by reacting with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOST) or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole<br><br>
(MBT) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to produce reactive ester of the acid (IV) which<br>
then reacted to cephem moiety to prepare cephem antibiotics, but the processes are time consuming and with low yields, hence not suitable.<br>
US patent 4767852 discloses a process for production of cephems by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US Pat.No.5026843 (1991) disclosed a process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of ACT by using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality. Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins having an oximino group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in 7-position of cephem compounds.<br>
However, the synthesis of MAEM from acid (III) and 2,2'-dithio-bis-benzothiazole involves use of costly condensing agent triphenylphosphine (TPP). Moreover, during condensation of MAEM with 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid compound (III), a toxic compound MBT is also produced as a byproduct, see e.g., Chemical Abstracts, 111, 19243p (1989) which is difficult to remove completely.<br>
Thus it is evident that the procedures described in the prior art for preparation of these antibiotics are complex, involving protection, deprotection and are associated with toxic byproduct generation. Hence there is a need to develop new acylating agents which are capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to cephem compounds of formula (III) in good yield but without producing this toxic byproduct. On the similar lines, a new thioester was reported by D.G.Walker, Tet. Lett. 1990, 31,6481 to acylate the cephem moiety to get cefepime sulfate but yields obtained by using this thioester were in the range of 54-73% which cannot be considered as good yield to operate a process at commercial scale. The use of this thioester was reported in the Tet. Lett. 1990, 31, 6481 only for cefepime and not for other cephalosporins. This thioester was exploited in US patent No. 5869649 for making three other important cephem antibiotics.<br><br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to prepare novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (I), which would be better than the existing reactive derivatives and suitable for being used in the manufacture of cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of thioester derivatives of formula (I) from thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (IV) and thio-oxadiazoles of the general formula (VI).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple, high yielding and cost-effective process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (II).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to produce cephalosporin antibiotics that are highly pure and free from toxic byproducts.<br>
One more objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (II) from the said novel thioester derivatives.<br>

The present invention provides a method by which cephalosporin antibiotics are obtained in high purity (95-99%) and excellent yield (79-95%) without the necessity for protecting the amino group of the acylating agents and the production of toxic byproduct namely 2-mercaptobenzothiazole is avoided.<br>
The substituent R4 in cephem compound (III) represents methyl, acetyloxymethyl, methoxymethyl, vinyl, pyridylmethyl, propenyl, 2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-<br><br>
