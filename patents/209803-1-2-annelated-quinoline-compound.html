" 1,2-ANNELATED QUINOLINE COMPOUND"<br>
JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V., of Turnhoutseweg 30, B-2340 Beerse,<br>
Belgium,	<br>
The following specification particularly, describes ,JJae invention and the manner in which it is to be performe .<br><br>
The present invention relates to a 1,2-annelated quinoline compound.<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel 1,2-annelated quinoline derivatives, the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said novel compounds and the use of these compounds as a medicine as well as methods of treatment by administering said compounds.<br>
Oncogenes frequently encode protein components of signal transduction pathways which lead to stimulation of cell growth and mitogenesis. Oncogene expression in cultured cells leads to cellular transformation, characterized by the ability of cells to grow in soft agar and the growth of cells as dense foci lacking the contact inhibition exhibited by non-transformed cells. Mutation and/or overexpression of certain oncogenes is frequently associated with human cancer. A particular group of oncogenes is known as ras which have been identified in mammals, birds, insects, mollusks, plants, fungi and yeasts. The family of mammalian ras oncogenes consists of three major members ("isoforms"): H-ras, K-ras and N-ras oncogenes. These ras oncogenes code for highly related proteins generically known as p21ras. Once attached to plasma membranes, the mutant or oncogenic forms of p2lras will provide a signal for the transformation and uncontrolled growth of malignant tumor cells. To acquire this transforming potential, the precursor of the p21rasoncoprotein must undergo an enzymatically catalyzed famesylation of the cysteine residue located in a carboxyl-ierminal tetrapeptide. Therefore, inhibitors of the enzymes that catalyzes this modification, i.e. famesyl transferase, will prevent the membrane attachment of p21ras and block the aberrant growth of ras-transformed tumbrS; Hence, it is generally accepted in the art that famesyl transferase inhibitors can be very useful as anticancer agents for tumors in which ras contributes to transformation.<br>
The K-ras B isoform has been observed to be the dominant isoform which is mutated in human cancers, panicular in colon (50% incidence) and pancreatic (90% incidence) cancers. However, it was also found that ras protein activation in the K-ras B isoform transformed cancers is resistant to inhibition of famesyl transferase. The isoform confers resistance to famesyl transferase inhibitors, but makes this isoform also substrate for geranylgerany] transferase I. Therefore, inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase may inhibit the aberrant growth of K-ras transformed tumors which are resistant to famesyl transferase inhibitors.<br><br><br>

The K-ras B isoform has been observed to be the dominant isoform which is mutated in human cancers, particular in colon (50% incidence) and pancreatic (90% incidence) cancers. However, it was also found that ras protein activation in the K-ras B isoform transformed cancers is resistant to inhibition of famesyl transferase. The isoform confers resistance to famesyl transferase inhibitors, but makes this isoform also substrate for geranylgeranyl transferase I. Therefore, inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase may inhibit the aberrant growth of K-ras transformed tumors which are resistant to famesyl transferase inhibitors.<br><br><br>
Since mutated oncogenic forms of ras are frequently found in many human cancers, most notably in more than 50 % of colon and pancreatic carcinomas (Kohl et al., Science, vol 260, 1834 -1837,1993), it has been suggested that famesyl tranferase inhibitors can be very useful against these types of cancer.<br>
InVEP-0,371,564 there are described (1H-azol-l-ylmethyl) substituted quinoline and quirrefrrione derivatives which suppress the plasma elimination of retinoic acids. Some of these compounds also have the ability to inhibit the formation of androgens from progestines and/or inhibit the action of the aromatase enzyme complex.<br>
InWo 97/16443, WO 97/21701, WO 98/40383 and WO 98/49157/there are described 2-quinolone derivatives which exhibit famesyl transferase inhibiting activity.<br><br>
Unexpectedly, it has been found that the present novel 1,2-annelated quinoline compounds, bearing a nitrogen- or carbon-linked imidazole, show famesyl protein transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibiting activity.<br>

This invention provides a method for inhibiting the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g. loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation of another gene; (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant ras activation occurs. Furthermore, it has been suggested in literature that ras oncogenes not only contribute to the growth of tumors in vivo by a direct effect on tumor cell growth but also indirectly, i.e. by facilitating tumor-induced angiogenesis (Rak. J. et al, Cancer Research, 55,4575-4580, 1995). Hence, pharmacologically targeting mutant ras oncogenes could conceivably suppress solid tumor growth in vivo, in part, by inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis.<br>
is invention also provides a method for inhibiting tumor growth by administering an<br><br>
effective amount of a compound of the present invention, to a subject, e.g. a mammal (and more particularly a human) in need of such treatment. In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting the growth of tumors expressing an activated ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds of the present invention. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g. adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g. pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g. colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage (e.g. acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), tumors of mesenchymal origin (e.g. fibrosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas), melanomas, teratocarcinomas, neuroblastomas, gliomas, benign tumor of the skin (e.g. keratoacanthomas), breast carcinoma, kidney carcinoma, ovary carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and epidermal carcinoma.<br>
This invention may also provide a method for inhibiting proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in genes. With said inhibition being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds described herein, to a subject in need of such a treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neuro¬fibromatosis, or tumors in which ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes, may be inhibited by the compounds of this invention.<br>
The compounds of present invention are particularly useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein the K-ras B isoform is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation.<br>
Hence, the present invention discloses the compounds of formula (I) for use as a medicine as well as the use of these compounds of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating one or more of the above mentioned conditions.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is<br><br><br><br>
comomed m intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable earner, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the earner comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those skilled in the an could easily determine the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that an effective amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0,05<br><br>
mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.5 to 500 mg, and in particular 1 mg to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>

Example C.3 : "Famesyl Protein Transferase Inhibitor Secondary Tumor Model". The famesyl protein transferase inhibitor secondary tumor model was used as descritx in WO 98/40383 , page 37.<br>
Example C4 :" Geranvlgeranvltransferase Type I Assay ". Background: The enzyme GGTase I catalyzes the covalent attachment of a C-20 geranylgeranyl moiety derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to the K-ras oncogene product p21K-ras. The geranylgeranylation proceeds via formation of a thioether linkage to a single, specific cysteine residue contained in a cys-A-A-X motif wherein A represents neutral amino acids and X represents a C-terminal leucine or methionine. Famesylation of H,N, and K-ras isoforms by famesyl protein transferase is required for activation and attachment of p21ras to plasma membranes. However, the K-ras isoform, which is the dominant isoform of ras in human tumors, is also isoprenylated by GGTase I. Therefore, inhibitors of GGTase I may inhibit the aberrai<br><br><br>
growth of K-ras transformed human tumors which are resistant to protein<br>
farnesyltransferase inhibitors.<br>
Methods: Compounds were screened in vitro using GGTase I enzyme prepared from<br>
Kirsten virus transformed human osteosarcoma (KHOS) cells. The assay measures the<br>
covalent attachment of radioactivity from [3H]-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to the K-<br>
ras peptide substrate biotinKKKKKKSKTLCVIM or biotinYRASNRSCAIL substrate.<br>
Measurements: Percent control GGTase I activity.<br>
Derived Variables: Control enzyme activity = [CPM3H-geranylgeranyJ peptide<br>
product in the presence of vehicle solvent]<br>
Test compound concentration = 10 uM. Test compound % control activity = (CPM 3H-geranylgeranyl peptide product in the presence of test compound /control enzyme activity) X 100%<br>
Standard Conditions: Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 20 mM. Further dilutions were prepared in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay medium was 10%. The compound concentration tested for screening was 10 uM.<br>
D. Composition example : Film-coated tablets preparation of lablet core<br>
