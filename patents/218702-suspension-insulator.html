				<td>SUSPENSION INSULATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a suspension insulator for high<br>
voltage transmission, which improves pollution withstand voltage<br>
characteristics.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
[0002] In the suspension insulator, if a salt component in seawater<br>
carried by wind and weather or a salt component in an exhaust gas from<br>
a factory is adhered to a surface of the suspension insulator and the<br>
suspension insulator becomes a wet state due to such a salt component,<br>
an insulation resistance of a surface of the suspension insulator is<br>
decreased. In this case, there is a drawback such that a flashover may<br>
occur due to reduction of pollution withstand voltage characteristics.<br>
Therefore, in the case of performing an insulation design of power trans-<br>
mission equipment, it is very important to take the pollution withstand<br>
voltage characteristics of the suspension insulator into consideration.<br>
[0003] Generally, it is known that the pollution withstand voltage<br>
characteristics can be improved by designing a longer creepage distance<br>
of the suspension insulator. Therefore, in the known suspension<br>
insulator, a method for designing a longer creepage distance by making a<br>
diameter of shed of the suspension insulator larger or by increasing the<br>
number of ribs arranged on an under surface of the suspension insulator<br>
or a depth between the ribs is adopted. However, in the method<br>
mentioned above, there is a drawback such that a dimension of the<br>
suspension insulator becomes necessarily larger.<br>
[0004] Moreover, except for a geometrical shape design mentioned<br>
above, there is known a method such that the pollution withstand voltage<br>
characteristics are recovered by arranging a conductive glaze on a surface<br>
of the insulator so as to flow a weak current thereon and by drying wet<br>
pollution substances adhered to the surface of the insulator by means of a<br>
heating effect due to the weak current. Further, a method for improving<br>
the pollution withstand voltage characteristics is also actually utilized<br>
wherein an electric field relaxation is performed by relaxing a potential<br>
inclination along the surface of the insulator and a discharge due to a<br>
partly and rapidly deviating electric field. This method mentioned<br>
above is very effective, but there arises a deterioration such that a<br>
surface of the conductive glaze is sometimes eroded by an environmental<br>
pollution or such that a surface resistance is sometimes increased.<br>
[0005] In order to solve the drawbacks mentioned above, the present<br>
applicant proposed a suspension insulator, in Japanese Patent Application<br>
No. 11-369186, such that a circular electrode is arranged on an under<br>
surface, to which a glaze is arranged, axially with respect to a pin fitting,<br>
or, such that a resistance zone having an electric resistance of 1 - 100 MO,<br>
(corresponding to a surface resistance of 4.3 - 430 MO) is arranged on<br>
the circular electrode and on a portion between the circular electrode and<br>
the pin fitting. The suspension insulator mentioned above shows a<br>
sufficient performance for the pollution withstand voltage characteristics<br>
that are necessary at that time. However, the suspension insulator<br>
mentioned above sometimes shows a poor performance for higher<br>
pollution withstand voltage characteristics and a higher discharge<br>
suppress performance that are recently required. Therefore, a suspension<br>
insulator having higher pollution withstand voltage characteristics and a<br>
higher discharge suppress performance is required.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] An object of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacks<br>
mentioned above and to provide a suspension insulator which can<br>
respectively perform an improvement of pollution withstand voltage<br>
characteristics and a prevention of a discharge and which can improve a<br>
voltage distribution along an insulator string.<br>
[0007] According to a first aspect of the invention, a suspension<br>
insulator having a shed including an upper surface and an under surface<br>
comprises: a pin fitting arranged at its center portion and projected from<br>
the under surface; a plurality of circular ribs arranged around the pin<br>
fitting in a concentric manner; a resistance zone having a surface<br>
resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) of not greater than 4MO and arranged on the<br>
under surface at an inner portion continuing from the pin fitting; and a<br>
conductive zone arranged on the under surface at an outer peripheral<br>
portion of the resistance zone.<br>
[0008] Moreover, according to a second aspect of the invention, a<br>
suspension insulator having a shed including an upper surface and an<br>
under surface comprises: a pin fitting arranged at its center portion and<br>
projected from the under surface; a plurality of circular ribs arranged<br>
around the pin fitting in a concentric manner; and a resistance zone<br>
arranged on the under surface at an inner portion continuing from the pin<br>
fitting and existing between the pin fitting and an inner root portion of<br>
the rib.<br>
[0009] As mentioned above, since the resistance zone having a<br>
predetermined resistance and the conductive zone are arranged in the<br>
first aspect of the invention, or, since the resistance zone is arranged at a<br>
predetermined position in the second aspect of the invention, a position<br>
to which a high electric power is concentrated can be moved outward<br>
with respect to the center of insulator, and thus it is possible to form a<br>
stable dry zone with a low power. As a result, it is also possible to<br>
improve a voltage distribution along the insulator string and thus it is<br>
also possible improve pollution withstand voltage characteristics and tc<br>
prevent a discharge. In the present invention, a term "a portion between<br>
the pin fitting and an inner root portion of the rib" means a portion<br>
between the pin fitting and a bottom of the target circular rib that is near<br>
to the pin fitting among a plurality of circular ribs.<br>
[0010] As a preferred embodiment of the invention, both in the first<br>
aspect of the invention in which the resistance zone and the conductive<br>
zone are arranged and in the second aspect of the invention in which the<br>
resistance zone is arranged at a predetermined position, the following<br>
embodiments are preferred since the effects of the invention can be<br>
further improved: a material of the resistance zone is a conductive glaze<br>
of ferric oxide series or a conductive glaze of tin oxide series; and a<br>
resistance zone as is the same as the resistance zone arranged on the<br>
under surface at an inner portion continuing from a cap fitting arranged<br>
on a head portion of the suspension insulator is arranged on an upper<br>
surface thereof, and a conductive zone as is the same as the conductive<br>
zone arranged on the under surface is arranged on the upper surface at an<br>
outer peripheral portion of the resistance zone. Moreover, in the first<br>
aspect of the invention, the following embodiments are preferred since<br>
the effects of the invention can be further improved: the conductive zone<br>
has a half or less surface resistance as compared with that of the<br>
resistance zone; the resistance zone is arranged at a portion between the<br>
pin fitting and an inner root portion of the rib; a material of the conduc-<br>
tive zone is a metal, a conductive glaze of ferric oxide series having a<br>
low resistance or a conductive glaze of tin oxide series having a low<br>
resistance, and a thickness of the glaze of the conductive zone is larger<br>
than that of the glaze of the resistance zone; and the conductive zone,<br>
whose thickness is larger than that of the resistance zone, is formed by<br>
arranging a recess to the under surface at a portion to which the conduc-<br>
tive zone is formed, and filling a conductive material such as the<br>
conductive glaze of ferric oxide series or tin oxide series in the thus<br>
formed recess. Furthermore, in the second aspect of the invention, the<br>
following embodiment is preferred since the effects of the invention can<br>
be improved: the resistance zone has a surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm)<br>
of not greater than 4MO. <br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012] Figs, la and lb are schematic views respectively showing one<br>
embodiment of a suspension insulator according to the first aspect of the<br>
invention. Fig. la shows a partial cross sectional view that is viewed<br>
from a front side, and Fig. lb illustrates a schematic view that is viewed<br>
from an under side. In Figs, la and lb, a suspension insulator 1 accord-<br>
ing to the invention has a construction mentioned below. A number of<br>
concentric circular ribs 13 are integrally formed to an inner under surface<br>
of a shed portion 12 of an insulator body 11. Here, a first circular rib <br>
13-1 and a second circular rib 13-2 are arranged from a near side of a pin <br>
fitting 12. In this embodiment, a projection portion 13A that is nearest <br>
to the pin fitting 12 is not the circular rib, but a so-called circular hump.<br>
A hallow head portion 14 is integrally formed at a center upper portion<br>
of the shed portion 12. A generally known insulation glaze is arranged<br>
on an overall surface of the insulator body 11 so as to form an insulation<br>
glaze zone 15 as an insulation surface.<br>
[0013] Sand zones 16 are respectively arranged on an outer side<br>
surface and an inner side surface of the head portion 14. A cap fitting <br>
22 of a ground side and the pin fitting 21 of a power supply side are <br>
respectively fixed to an outer surface and an inner surface of the head<br>
portion 14 of the insulation body 11 via Portland cement. Therefore,<br>
the cap fitting 22 and the pin fitting 21 are positioned at both ends of the<br>
insulator body 11 respectively. A depression portion 22a for fastening<br>
the pin fitting 21 of the other suspension insulator 1 arranged just above<br>
is formed in an upper portion of the cap fitting 22. An under portion of<br>
the pin fitting 21 is fastened to the depression portion 22a of the other<br>
suspension insulator 1 arranged just beneath. In this manner, a number<br>
of the suspension insulators 1 according to the invention are connected<br>
with each other in series, and this state is called as a string.<br>
[0014] Features of the first aspect of the suspension insulator 1<br>
according to the invention lie in the constructions such that a resistance<br>
zone 31 having a surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) of not greater than<br>
4 MO is arranged on an under surface at an inner portion continuing<br>
from the pin fitting 21 and such that a circular conductive zone 32 is<br>
arranged on the under surface at an outer peripheral portion of the<br>
resistance zone 31. In this case, it is preferred that the circular<br>
conductive zone 32 has a half or less surface resistance as compared with <br>
that of the resistance zone 31. Moreover, it is preferred that a material <br>
of the conductive zone 32 is a metal, a conductive glaze of ferric oxide J f<br>
series having a low resistance or a conductive glaze of tin oxide series<br>
having a low resistance, and a thickness of the glaze of the conductive<br>
zone is larger than that of the glaze of the resistance zone 31. Further,<br>
it is preferred that the resistance zone 31 is arranged at a portion<br>
between the pin fitting 21 and the inner root portion of the first circular<br>
rib 13-1 or between the pin fitting 21 and an inner root portion of the<br>
second circular rib 13-2. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
resistance zone 31 is arranged from the pin fitting 21 to the inner root<br>
portion of the first circular rib 13-1. Furthermore, it i$ preferred that a<br>
material of the resistance zone 31 is a conductive glaze of ferric oxide<br>
series or a conductive glaze of thin oxide series. Moreover, it is<br>
preferred that a resistance zone as is the same as the resistance zone 31<br>
arranged on the under surface at an inner portion continuing from the cap <br>
fitting 22 arranged on the head portion 14 of the suspension insulator 1 <br>
is arranged on an upper surface of the suspension insulator 1, and a <br>
conductive zone as is the same as the conductive zone 32 arranged on the<br>
under surface is arranged on the upper surface at an outer peripheral<br>
portion of the resistance zone 31.<br>
[0015] Fig. 2 is a partial cross sectional view showing another<br>
embodiment of the suspension insulator according to the first aspect of<br>
the invention. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, portions similar to<br>
those of Figs, la and lb are denoted by the same reference numerals as<br>
those of Figs, la and lb, and the explanations thereof are omitted here.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, features different from the embodi-<br>
ment shown in Figs, la and lb are that the conductive zone 32, whose<br>
glaze thickness is larger than that of the resistance zone 31, is formed by<br>
arranging a recess 33 having a circular cross section to the under surface<br>
of the insulator body 11 at a portion to which the circular conductive<br>
zone 32 is formed, and filling a conductive material constructing the<br>
conductive zone 32 such as the conductive glaze of ferric oxide series or<br>
tin oxide series in the thus formed recess 33, Moreover, a shape of the<br>
suspension insulator 1 is different from the embodiment shown in<br>
Figs, la and lb, and the suspension insulator 1 shown in Fig. 2 has a thin<br>
and long rib shape. In the suspension insulator 1 shown in Fig. 2 does<br>
not have the circular hump 13A shown in Figs, la and lb.<br>
[0016] If the conductive zone 32 is formed as mentioned above, it is<br>
possible to further prevent a stress concentration and a concentration of<br>
electric stresses to the conductive zone 32, and thus it is a preferred<br>
embodiment. Moreover, in an anti-pollution type insulator such as the<br>
suspension insulator 1 shown in Fig. 2 having a thin and long rib shape,<br>
it is possible to move a position of the dry zone form near the pin fitting<br>
to the outer ribs as is clearly understood from the following embodiments.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to further improve the effects of the invention<br>
such that a wide dry zone can be formed as compared with the<br>
suspension insulator 1 shown in Figs, la and lb.<br>
[0017] Figs. 3a and 3b are schematic views respectively showing one<br>
embodiment of a suspension insulator according to the second aspect of<br>
the invention. Fig. 3a shows a partial cross sectional view that is<br>
viewed from a front side, and Fig. 3b illustrates a schematic view that is<br>
viewed from an under side. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 3a and<br>
3b, portions similar to those of Figs, la and lb are denoted by the same<br>
reference numerals as those of Figs, la and lb, and the explanations<br>
thereof are omitted here. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 3a and 2b,<br>
features different from the embodiment shown in Figs, la and lb are that<br>
only the resistance zone 31 is arranged at a portion between the pin<br>
fitting 21 and the inner root portion of the circular rib and the conductive<br>
zone 32 is not arranged, i.e. the resistance zone 31 is arranged from the<br>
pin fitting 21 and the inner root portion of the first circular rib 13-1 or<br>
from the pin fitting 21 and the inner root portion of the second circular<br>
rib 13-2. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 3a and 2b, the resistance<br>
zone 31 is arranged from the pin fitting 21 and the inner root portion of<br>
the first circular rib 13-1.<br>
[0018] In this case, it is preferred that a surface resistance (1 cm x<br>
1 cm ) of the resistance zone 31 is not greater than 4 MO. Moreover, as<br>
is the same as the second aspect of the invention, it is preferred that a<br>
material of the resistance zone 31 is a conductive glaze of ferric oxide<br>
series or a conductive glaze of tin oxide series. Further, it is preferred<br>
that a resistance zone as is the same as the resistance zone 31 continuing<br>
from the cap fitting 22 arranged on the head portion 14 of the suspension<br>
insulator 1 is arranged on an upper surface thereof, and a conductive<br>
zone is arranged on the upper surface at an outer peripheral portion of<br>
the resistance zone.<br>
[0019] In the first aspect of the invention and the second aspect of the<br>
invention mentioned above, since the resistance zone 31 having a<br>
predetermined surface resistance and the circular conductive zone 32 are<br>
arranged in the first aspect of the invention, and, since the resistance<br>
zone 31 is arranged at a predetermined position in the second aspect of<br>
the invention, it is possible to move a zone having a high electric power<br>
density, that is apt to be positioned near the pin fitting 21 in the known<br>
suspension insulators, toward an outer circular ribs, and thus it is<br>
possible to form a stable dry zone with a low electric power. As a<br>
result, it is also possible to improve a voltage distribution along the<br>
insulator string and thus it is possible to improve pollution withstand<br>
voltage characteristics and to prevent a discharge.<br>
[0020] Then, in the suspension insulator according to the invention<br>
having the construction mentioned above, a theory for improving the<br>
pollution withstand voltage and suppressing the discharge is discussed.<br>
[0021] At first, an electric power density distribution with respect to a<br>
single suspension insulator is calculated under a condition such that a<br>
surface resistance of the pollution zone is constant. As a suspension <br>
insulator used for this calculation, use is made of a known suspension<br>
insulator (normal one) in which the resistance zone and the circular<br>
conductive zone are not arranged with respect to a base suspension<br>
insulator having a diameter of 250 mm and a shape shown in Fig. 4, and<br>
 a suspension insulator according to the invention in which the resistance<br>
zone 31 is arranged from the pin fitting 21 to a rib bottom El positioned<br>
at the inner root portion of the first circular rib 13-1 by using the<br>
conductive glaze and the conductive zone 32 is arranged at the rib<br>
bottom El with respect to the base suspension insulator mentioned above.<br>
Calculation conditions are as follows:<br>
(1) A surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) of the pollution zone : 14.7 MO<br>
(resistance per single insulator : 10 MO);<br>
(2) A surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) of the conductive glaze : 0.5 MO;<br>
(3) The electric power density distribution is calculated from an<br>
integrated resistance of the pollution zone and the conductive<br>
glaze; and<br>
(4) A resistance of the conductive glaze between the pin fitting and the<br>
circular conductive zone : about 100 kO.<br>
[0022] The calculation result is shown in Fig. 5 by a relation between<br>
a creepage distance from the pin fitting side where a position of the pin<br>
fitting is 0 and an electric power density. From the result shown in<br>
Fig. 5, it is understood that, in the known normal suspension insulator in<br>
which the resistance zone and the circular conductive zone are not<br>
arranged, an electric power density is high at a portion around the pin<br>
fitting and a dry zone 41 is formed around the pin fitting 21, so that a<br>
discharge occurs around the pin fitting 21. On the other hand, it is<br>
understood that, in the suspension insulator according to the invention in<br>
which the circular conductive zone 32 is arranged at the rib bottom E1<br>
and the conductive glaze is arranged from the pin fitting 21 to the rib<br>
bottom El as the resistance zone 31, an electric power density is<br>
decreased at a portion near the pin fitting 21 and thus a portion of the<br>
dry zone 41 is moved outward with respect to the circular conductive<br>
zone 32.<br>
[0023] Then, a relation between a position of the dry zone and a<br>
maximum electric field that occur in the suspension insulator is<br>
discussed. In the suspension insulator having the construction shown in<br>
Fig. 4, it is assumed that the dry zone 41 having a constant width of 40<br>
mm in the creepage direction (radius direction) is formed, at a portion<br>
between the cement 18 and the circular hump 13A, at the rib bottom El<br>
that is positioned at the inner root portion of the first circular rib 13-1, at<br>
the first circular rib 13-1, at a rib bottom E2 that is positioned at the inner<br>
root portion of the second circular rib 13-2, or at the second circular rib<br>
13-2. Then, maximum creepage electric fields are calculated per the<br>
number of repeating the wet/dry steps. Moreover, in the case that the<br>
dry zone 41 is arranged at the first circular rib 13-1 and the second<br>
circular rib 13-2, a first circular rib (estimation) and a second circular<br>
rib (estimation) that are estimated after a step 4, are also calculated.<br>
In this case, the reason, such that the estimation values in the case that<br>
the dry zone 41 is arranged at the first circular rib and the second<br>
circular rib are calculated, is as follows. That is to say, since a<br>
porcelain volume of respective circular ribs 13-1 and 13-2 is small, a<br>
temperature of the overall circular rib is increased at constant. There-<br>
fore, an effect of reducing an electric field is expected because the<br>
overall rib is dried up. The calculation is performed according to a<br>
calculation flowchart shown in Fig. 6 under a condition such that a<br>
surface resistance of the pollution zone is a constant conductivity at an<br>
initial value and is in proportion to the electric power density after the<br>
next step. The result of. the calculation is shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7,<br>
as an electric field at which a discharge occurs, use is made of a value of<br>
5 kV/cm since this value is known in this technical field.<br>
[0024] From the result shown in Fig. 7, the followings are understood:<br>
An incrcase of the maximum elecric field is rapid in the case<br>
of a normal state in which a portion near the cement of the pin fitting <br>
side is dried; <br>
An increase of the maximum electric field becomes slow when <br>
the dry zone is formed outward with respect to the pin fitting; and<br>
An increase of the electric field becomes particularly slow in<br>
the case that the dry zone is formed at the rib. It is supposed that, since<br>
a radius difference between an inner surface and an outer surface is small<br>
at the rib portion and since a porcelain volume of the circular rib is small,<br>
a temperature of the rib is increased before reaching to the electric field<br>
at which a discharge occurs, and thus it is possible to prevent such a<br>
discharge.<br>
[0025] Then, a relation between a forming position of the dry zone 41<br>
and a variation of electric field is summarized on the basis of the<br>
calculation result shown in Fig. 7 and is compared. That is to say, from<br>
the result shown in Fig. 7, a relation between a creepage distance from<br>
the pin fitting 21 and an electric field in a creepage direction is obtained<br>
for respective steps with respect to the suspension insulator in which the<br>
dry zone 41 of 40 mm is arranged at the first circular rib 13-1 and the<br>
suspension insulator in which the dry zone 41 is arranged around the pin<br>
fitting 21 i.e. at a portion between the cement and the circular hump 13A.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 8. In the case that the dry zone 41 of 40 mm<br>
is arranged at the first circular rib 13-1, a radius of the inner root portion<br>
of the first circular rib 13-1 is 62.1 mm and a radius of a position 40 mm<br>
outward (in a creepage direction) from the inner root portion is 74.9 mm.<br>
Therefore, a radius ratio between an inner portion and an outer portion is<br>
1.21. On the other hand, in the case that the dry zone 41 of 40 mm is<br>
arranged around the pin fitting 21, a radius of the cement portion is<br>
23.4 mm and a radius of a position 40 mm outward (in a creepage<br>
direction) from the cement portion is 45.3 mm. Therefore, a radius<br>
ratio between an inner portion and an outer portion is 1.94.<br>
[0026] Then, characteristics of the insulator string in which a number<br>
of suspension insulators are connected in series are investigated. As a<br>
factor determines voltage distribution, there is an easily drying property<br>
of the dry zone. Allotted voltage in the insulator string is highest at a<br>
power supply end and becomes smaller at a center portion. These<br>
allotted voltages at the power supply end and at the center portion are<br>
different by about 3 times. In order to. simulate this situation easily, it<br>
is assumed that an initial resistance of the single suspension insulator is<br>
varied in a range of 10 - 30 MO, equidistantly. If a wet/dry operation<br>
proceeds by one step from this initial state, it is assumed that the<br>
resistance of respective insulators is decreased by 0.7 times. Since a<br>
current flowing through the insulator string is increased, power losses of<br>
some insulators with high allotted voltage may become greater than the<br>
predetermined value. In this case, resistance values of these insulators<br>
are increased 1.4 times. The assumptions for calculation are as follows:<br>
(1) 200 kV is applied to the insulator string having 20 insulators in series;<br>
(2) In order to calculate easily, a calculation is performed under an<br>
assumption such that a resistance of the insulator is not varied in<br>
accordance with a temperature variation; and<br>
(3) Since an impedance of the insulator does not become greater than<br>
50MO due to a capacitance of the insulator, an upper limit of the<br>
resistance value is set by arranging a resistor of 50MO in parallel.<br>
[0027] A calculation result of a relation between a wet progress and a<br>
allotted voltage is shown in Fig. 10, and a calculation result of a relation<br>
between an electric power at which the pollution zone starts to be dry<br>
and the number of insulators with high allotted voltage is shown in<br>
Fig. 11. The wet progress in Fig. 10 shows a numerical value corre-<br>
sponding to a time progress. From the result shown in Fig. 10, it is<br>
understood that, in an initial state, a voltage load difference is 3 times,<br>
but, according to a wet progress, some insulators show high allotted<br>
voltage and other insulators show very low allotted voltage. From the<br>
result shown in Fig. 11, it is understood that, if the electric power at<br>
which the pollution zone starts to be dry becomes lower, the number of<br>
the insulators with high allotted voltage is increased and the maximum<br>
allotted voltage becomes low. Therefore, it is understood that, the<br>
insulator, which can be dried up with a low electric power, shows an<br>
excellent voltage distribution along an insulator string.<br>
[0028] Then, by performing a pollution test for the insulator string<br>
having 20 insulators in series, a drying condition of the suspension<br>
insulator is investigated with respect to the suspension insulator according<br>
to the invention in which the circular conductive zone and the resistance<br>
zone are arranged and the known suspension insulator in which the<br>
circular conductive zone and the resistance zone are not arranged.<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 12a and 12b. Fig. 12a shows a drying<br>
condition of the suspension insulator according to the invention, and<br>
Fig. 12b illustrates a drying condition of the known suspension insulator.<br>
In Figs. 12a and 12b, a portion colored by red shows a drying state.<br>
From the result shown in Fig. 12a, it is understood that, in the insulator<br>
string using the suspension insulator according to the invention, 12<br>
suspension insulators among 20 show a drying state at near the second rib,<br>
from the result shown in Fig. 12b, it is understood that, in the insulator<br>
string using the known suspension insulators, 5 suspension insulators<br>
among 20 show a drying state at a portion between the pin fitting and the<br>
rib bottom El, and a ratio of the dried up suspension insulator is 25%.<br>
[0029] From the results mentioned above, the followings are<br>
understood:<br>
(1) Since a radius difference between an inner portion and an outer<br>
portion is small at the rib portion, an electric field distribution in a<br>
creepage direction becomes relatively constant, and thus it is<br>
possible to suppress a discharge occurrence;<br>
(2) Since a porcelain volume of the rib portion is small, a dry zone can<br>
be formed by a low electric power, and thus it is possible to<br>
improve a voltage distribution along a string; and<br>
(3) From the results mentioned in (1) and (2), a pollution withstand<br>
voltage is improved, and thus it is possible to obtain a suspension<br>
insulator which can suppress a discharge.<br>
[0030] Hereinafter, actual experiments will be explained.<br>
Experiment 1 (as to positions of circular conductive zone and resistance<br>
zone)<br>
In order to obtain a preferred embodiment about the positions<br>
of the circular conductive zone and the resistance zone, a suspension<br>
insulator was prepared, in which the circular conductive zone (electrode)<br>
was arranged at a position among positions (1)-(7) shown in Fig. 13 and<br>
the resistance zone was arranged from the pin fitting to the one of the<br>
positions (1)-(7) mentioned above. The thus prepared suspension<br>
insulators were connected with each other in five series to obtain the<br>
insulator string. Then, with respect to the thus obtained insulator string,<br>
clean fog tests based on JEC-0201 "AC Voltage Insulation Tests" defined<br>
as a standard of the Japanese Electrotechnical Committee were performed<br>
under a condition such as a salt deposit density of 0.25 mg/cm2 and a test<br>
voltage of 55 kV so as to investigate and estimate discharge condition.<br>
The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
[0031]<br>
[0032] From the results shown in Table 1, it was understood that, the<br>
suspension insulator, in which the circular conductive zone (electrode)<br>
was arranged at near the rib bottom £1 positioned at the inner root<br>
portion of the first circular rib 1-3-1 and the resistance zone was arranged<br>
from the pin fitting to the rib bottom El, was most effective. Moreover,<br>
it was understood that, the suspension insulator, in which the circular<br>
conductive zone was arranged at the rib bottom E2 between the first<br>
circular rib 13-1 and the second circular rib 13-2, was effective. Further,<br>
it was understood that, the suspension insulator, in which the circular<br>
conductive zone was arranged at respective ribs, was improved as<br>
compared with the known suspension insulator having no conductive<br>
zone and resistance zone.<br>
[0033]<br>
Experiment 2 (as to resistance value of resistance zone)<br>
In order to obtain a most preferred zone of a resistance value<br>
of the resistance zone, the known suspension insulator in which the<br>
circular conductive zone and the resistance zone were not arranged, the<br>
comparative suspension insulator in which the circular conductive zone<br>
was arranged at the rib bottom El positioned at the inner root portion of<br>
the first circular rib 13-1 and the circular conductive zone was<br>
electrically connected to the pin fitting, and the suspension insulator<br>
according to the invention in which the circular conductive zone was<br>
arranged at the rib bottom El positioned at the inner root portion of the<br>
first circular rib 13-1 and the resistance zone having a predetermined<br>
surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) was arranged at a portion between the<br>
pin fitting and the rib bottom El, were prepared respectively.<br>
[0034] Then, the thus prepared suspension insulators were connected<br>
in series in such a manner that 7 units were connected in the known<br>
suspension insulator and 5 units were connected both in the comparative<br>
suspension insulator and the suspension insulator according to the<br>
invention to obtain the insulator strings. Then, with respect to the thus<br>
obtained insulator strings, clean fog tests were performed in the same<br>
manner as that of experiment 1 under a condition such that a salt deposit<br>
density of 0.25 mg/cm2 and a test voltage of 55 kV so as to investigate<br>
and estimate discharge occurrence and withstand voltages. The result<br>
of the known suspension insulator is shown in the following Table 2, and<br>
the results of the comparative suspension insulator and the suspension<br>
insulator according to the invention are shown in the following Table 3.<br>
In Table 2 and Table 3, the discharge occurrence is shown in such a<br>
manner that, when the discharge occurs 2 times among 5 times trials, an<br>
indication is 2/5, and the withstand voltage is shown in such a manner<br>
that, when 7 times endure among 8 times trials, an indication is 7/8.<br>
[0035]<br>
[0036]<br>
[0037] From the results shown in Table 2 and Table 3, it was under-<br>
stood that a surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) should be not greater than<br>
4 MO in the present invention. Moreover, from the results of the clean<br>
fog tests, it was understood that the comparative suspension insulator, in<br>
which the circular conductive zone was electrically connected to the pin<br>
fitting, was effective. However, in cold switch on condition in which<br>
AC voltage is suddenly applied under polluted and wet condition or in<br>
condition in which sea water is sprayed, it is necessary to use a creepage<br>
distance between the circular conductive zone and the pin fitting.<br>
In the polluted and wet condition, a resistance between the circular<br>
conductive zone and the pin fitting becomes a few kO - a few 10 kO.<br>
In the suspension insulator according to the invention, the resistance<br>
between the circular conductive zone and the pin fitting can be higher<br>
resistance such as 50 kO - 1 MO, and thus it is possible to use a creepage<br>
distance at this portion effectively.<br>
[0038] In the embodiments mentioned above, the explanations are<br>
made to the suspension insulator in which the circular conductive zone<br>
and the resistance zone are arranged on the under surface. However, the<br>
same effects as is the same as the embodiments mentioned above can be<br>
obtained, if only the resistance zone having a surface resistance of not<br>
greater than 4 MO is arranged on the under surface, and further if the<br>
resistance zone as is the same as the resistance zone i.e. the resistance<br>
zone having a surface resistance (1 cm x 1 cm) arranged on the under<br>
surface at an inner portion continuing from the cap fitting arranged on<br>
the head portion of the suspension insulator is arranged on an upper<br>
surface thereof, and the conductive zone as is the same as the conductive<br>
zone arranged on the under surface is arranged on the upper surface at an<br>
outer peripheral portion of the resistance zone.<br>
[0039]<br>
Experi_me_nt_3,(as to effect of rib shape)<br>
In order to investigate an effect of a rib shape, the suspension<br>
insulator (CA-845) having a normal rib shape shown in Figs, la and lb and<br>
the suspension insulator (CA-894) having a thin and long rib shape shown<br>
in Fig. 2 were prepared. Shed shape parameters of respective suspension<br>
insulators are shown in the following Table 4. In addition, with respect<br>
to the respective suspension insulators, a normal suspension insulators in<br>
which the circular conductive zone and the resistance 2one are not<br>
arranged and the suspension insulator according to the invention in<br>
which the circular conductive zone is arranged at the rib bottom positioned<br>
at the inner root portion of the first circular rib 13-1 and the resistance<br>
zone having a predetermined surface resistance is arranged at a portion<br>
between the pin fitting and the rib bottom, were prepared. In the calcula-<br>
tion of CA-894, since the circular hump 13A is calculated as the first<br>
circular rib, but the situation is substantially same as that of CA-845.<br>
[0040] With respect to the thus prepared suspension insulators, a<br>
pollution withstand voltage (kV/unit) was measured according to the<br>
clean fog test, when a salt deposit density (=SDD, mg/cm2) is 0.25 or 1.0<br>
and the non-soluble material deposit density (=NSDD, mg/cm2) is 0.1 or<br>
0.2 respectively. The pollution withstand voltage was measured by<br>
measuring an overall pollution withstand voltage of the insulator string<br>
using the thus prepared suspension insulators according to the invention<br>
connected 5 units with each other in series, and calculating an average<br>
value per one unit from the thus measured overall pollution withstand<br>
voltage value. The result is shown in the following Table 5.<br>
[0041]<br>
[0043] From the result shown in Table 5, it was understood that CA-894<br>
having a thin and long rib shape can improve the pollution withstand<br>
voltage effectively as compared with CA-845 having a normal rib shape.<br>
Moreover, even in the CA-845 having a normal rib shape, the effects of<br>
the invention were detected slightly. Both in CA-894 and CA-845, it<br>
was understood that the discharge occurrence of the suspension insulator<br>
according to the invention was very small as compared with the normal<br>
suspension insulator.<br>
[0044]<br>
Experiment 4 (as to dry zone)<br>
In order to investigate a state of the dry zone according to the<br>
invention, with respect to the suspension insulator according to the<br>
invention having a thin and long rib shape in which the circular<br>
conductive zone and the resistance zone were arranged as shown in<br>
Fig. 2 and the suspension insulator with same shed profile in which the<br>
circular conductive zone and the resistance zone were not arranged, a<br>
surface temperature distribution at a pollution wet state was measured<br>
according to the clean fog test. A surface temperature distribution of<br>
the normal suspension insulator is shown in Fig. 14, and a surface<br>
temperature distribution of the suspension insulator according to the<br>
invention is shown in Fig. 15. If the results of Figs. 14 and 15 were<br>
compared, it was understood that the dry zone having a short width was<br>
formed at a portion near the pin in the normal suspension insulator, and,<br>
on the other hand, a temperature of the rib was increased gradually in a<br>
constant manner and a width of the dry zone was widened in the<br>
suspension insulator according to the invention.<br>
[0045] As mentioned above in detail, according to the invention, since<br>
the resistance zone having a predetermined resistance and the conductive<br>
zone are arranged in the first aspect of the invention, or, since the<br>
resistance zone is arranged at a predetermined position in the second<br>
aspect of the invention, a position to which a high electric power is<br>
concentrated can be moved outward with respect to the center of<br>
insulator, and thus it is possible to form a stable dry zone with a low<br>
electric power. As a result, it is also possible to improve a voltage<br>
distribution along the insulator string and thus it is possible to improve<br>
pollution withstand voltage characteristics and to prevent a discharge.<br><br>
