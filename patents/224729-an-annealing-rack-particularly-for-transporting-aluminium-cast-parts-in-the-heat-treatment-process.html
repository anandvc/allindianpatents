ANNEALING RACK<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to an annealing rack,<br>
particularly for transporting aluminum cast parts in the<br>
heat treatment process.<br>
Annealing racks for transporting annealing stock through<br>
an annealing furnace and also for quenching the annealing<br>
stock in quenching liquid are subjected to large<br>
temperature variations and local temperature<br>
differentials, so that they suffer large thermal<br>
tensions. When an annealing rack filled with annealing<br>
stock enters a furnace, the upper edge of the annealing<br>
rack heats up first, while the side walls and the floor<br>
are initially kept cold by the annealing stock. Due to<br>
the varying heating, warping and fractures of the<br>
annealing rack occur.<br>
A method for annealing and internal rinsing of copper<br>
pipe coils, the copper pipe coils being positioned in<br>
annealing racks stacked one on top of another as they<br>
pass through an annealing furnace, is known from DE 198<br>
304 85 A 1. The stacking and unstacking of the annealing<br>
racks is possible completely automatically. Detachable<br>
connections between individual parts of the annealing<br>
racks are not cited. With permanent connections, the<br>
danger exists of permanent bending, and in the worst case<br>
even a fracture. Securing the annealing product in the<br>
annealing rack is not provided. If the annealing rack<br>
bends, the annealing stock may thus shift or even tip<br>
over.<br><br>
-2-<br>
A transport basket for annealing stock in roller hearth<br>
furnaces, having a multipart floor made of multiple<br>
lattice grates lying next to one another, which are<br>
connected to one another in an articulated way having<br>
slight angular mobility through bolts, and having front<br>
and side walls which are connected permanently to the<br>
floor and are connected to one another with expansion<br>
mobility through profile clamps, is known from DE 344 45<br>
07 C2. This transport basket is laid directly on the<br>
hearth rollers and is carried along by them.<br>
In this case, the disadvantage is that the annealing<br>
stock may shift or tip over in such transport baskets<br>
during transport and may thus incur damage. The side<br>
plates are permanently connected to the lattice grates,<br>
particularly welded. Permanent bending and possibly even<br>
fracture may occur in this region. This may also cause<br>
shifting or tipping over of the annealing stock.<br>
Transport baskets bent in this way may not be stacked.<br>
Such stacking is also not provided.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of<br>
designing an annealing rack of the type cited, for the<br>
transport of aluminum cast parts in the heat treatment<br>
process in particular, in such a way that annealing stock<br>
of greatly varying forms is secured therein so it is safe<br>
from tipping and slipping during the conveyance.<br>
The object is achieved in an annealing rack of the type<br>
cited at the beginning in that it is constructed from at<br>
least one annealing rack element having at least one<br><br>
3<br>
annealing basket, which may be placed therein and is<br>
adaptable to the annealing stock.<br>
By dividing the annealing rack into annealing rack<br>
element(s) and, in addition, annealing basket (s), stock<br>
to be annealed may be placed securely in the annealing<br>
basket in a simple way and may then be placed with this<br>
basket in the annealing rack element. With heavier stock,<br>
the basket is first placed in the annealing rack element<br>
and subsequently filled. In additionally, using two or<br>
more annealing baskets per annealing rack element is also<br>
conceivable.<br>
The above-mentioned division allows the annealing rack<br>
element to be produced from very stable material in a<br>
simple basic shape. The annealing baskets are then to be<br>
designed individually for the particular stock to be<br>
transported for secure transport while avoiding shifting<br>
or tipping over of the annealing stock. A less stable<br>
material may be selected for the baskets than for the<br>
annealing rack elements. An annealing rack which is<br>
assembled from multiple annealing rack elements may thus<br>
receive annealing baskets of greatly varying design for<br>
the secure transport of annealing stock of greatly<br>
varying construction for simultaneous or sequential<br>
annealing processes.<br>
Preferred implementations are considered in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The annealing rack according to the present invention may<br>
be implemented in such a way that the annealing rack<br>
elements are stackable one on top of another. The height<br><br>
-4-<br>
of the annealing rack may thus be oriented to the<br>
quantity of the stock to be annealed.<br>
Furthermore, the annealing rack according to the present<br>
invention may be implemented in such a way that every<br>
annealing rack element has at least one rest and corner<br>
supports projecting upward from the corners of the rest.<br>
A centering aid, particularly a cone-taper connection, is<br>
conceivable for stacking the annealing rack elements, the<br>
end of the corner supports distal from the rest surface<br>
being provided as a cone and the end located on the<br>
support being provided with a receiving taper. Secure<br>
stacking and unstacking is thus made possible. In<br>
addition, slipping and upsetting of the stacked annealing<br>
rack elements in the event of dynamic loads during the<br>
transport is prevented.<br>
The floor may also be implemented in multiple parts, of<br>
course. It may then be constructed depending on the space<br>
required. The floor may have a closed surface, but<br>
grating or frame floors are preferred. In this case,<br>
perforated hollow profiles are preferably used for the<br>
frames.<br>
In a further embodiment, the corner supports may be<br>
connected to the rest and/or to one another using rack<br>
struts in at least one of the annealing rack elements.<br>
The rack struts cause stabilization of the corner<br>
supports and may prevent slipping of the annealing<br>
basket. The rack struts may, for example, be flat steel.<br>
In a further implementation of the annealing rack<br>
according to the present invention, the rest, the corner<br><br>
5<br>
supports, and possibly the rack struts of the annealing<br>
rack element are detachably connected to one another,<br>
particularly by plug-in connections. Through the<br>
detachable connections, all dynamic and thermal loads<br>
arising during transport through the annealing furnace<br>
may be absorbed without resulting in permanent<br>
deformation. For this purpose, the connections are<br>
preferably to be implemented having a slight play. After<br>
the quenching in the water bath, there is no permanent<br>
distortion of the annealing rack elements. The annealing<br>
rack element according to the present invention is<br>
therefore suitable for passing through the heat treatment<br>
process frequently. The individual components may be<br>
replaced easily. The storage costs are reduced, since the<br>
annealing rack elements in the disassembled state and<br>
individual replacement parts may be stored laid together<br>
flat.<br>
Furthermore, the annealing rack according to the present<br>
invention may be implemented in such a way that at least<br>
one of the annealing rack elements is provided with means<br>
for detachable fixing of the annealing basket. In this<br>
way, slipping of the annealing basket on the rest of the<br>
annealing rack element, particularly in the event of<br>
strong dynamic loads, is suppressed and/or reduced.<br>
Depressions in the rest of the particular annealing rack<br>
element, in which legs of the basket floor or the entire<br>
floor surface of the annealing basket may be placed, are<br>
particularly conceivable.<br>
Furthermore, the annealing rack according to the present<br>
invention may have an annealing basket in which the<br>
basket floor is implemented having basket supports<br><br>
6<br>
projecting upward. The components to be annealed are<br>
placed on the basket floor. The basket supports support<br>
the components somewhat in this case. They may be<br>
positioned on the basket floor as a function of the shape<br>
and number of the components. The basket supports are<br>
preferably hollow profiles, particularly perforated<br>
hollow profiles. The basket floor may also be produced<br>
from perforated hollow profiles and implemented as a<br>
frame or grating, for example.<br>
The annealing rack according to the present invention may<br>
also have basket struts, the basket supports being<br>
connected to the basket floor and/or to one another using<br>
the basket struts in at least one of the annealing<br>
baskets. In this case, the basket floor and the basket<br>
supports and possibly the basket struts may be connected<br>
to one another detachably, particularly by plug-in<br>
connections. The connections of basket floor, basket<br>
supports, and possibly basket struts are preferably to be<br>
implemented having a slight play. Permanent distortion in<br>
the heat treatment process is thus avoided. The basket<br>
struts not only stabilize the basket supports, but rather<br>
may additionally also support the components to be<br>
annealed. In this case, they may also be attached at<br>
different points as needed. The basket struts are<br>
preferably produced from flat steel or perforated hollow<br>
profiles.<br>
Furthermore, in the annealing frame according to the<br>
present invention, wire clips may be detachably attached<br>
to the basket floor and/or the basket supports and/or the<br>
basket struts. These wire clips may particularly be<br>
plugged in and/or screwed in. These wire clips are ideal<br><br>
7 <br>
for especially complex aluminum components, as are used<br>
in the automobile industry; for example. The individual<br>
annealing stock may be removed"easily during the<br>
automatic loading and unloading procedure, since it is<br>
centered by the wire clips. In this case, the wire clips<br>
may be plugged into prefabricated holes in the basket<br>
floor and/or the basket supports and/or the basket<br>
struts, and they may additionally be fixed using a nut<br>
for security. The wire clips generally only assume a<br>
centering function, while in contrast the remaining parts<br>
of the annealing basket are to be implemented as more<br>
stable. The annealing rack element is to be implemented<br>
as the most robust.<br>
Finally, in the annealing rack according to the present<br>
invention, at least one of the annealing baskets may be<br>
provided with means for detachable fixing on the<br>
annealing rack. The annealing basket may thus be attached<br>
to the annealing rack element and removed again easily.<br>
The present invention will be.explained in greater detail<br>
on the basis of the following exemplary embodiment.<br>

Figure 10 shows a detail view z of the plug-in connection<br>
annealing rack element/annealing basket.<br>
Figures 1-3 show an annealing rack element 1 in front<br>
and side views and a top view.<br>
The front view according to Figure 1 shows a short,<br>
horizontal, hollow rest profile 2 as a part of the rest<br>
3, which has multiple holes 4 and is connected via rack<br><br>
- 9-<br>
struts 5 to corner supports 6. All hollow profiles, i.e.,<br>
annealing rack elements and baskets, used in the<br>
annealing rack are preferably those having high<br>
geometrical moments of inertia. In addition, preferably<br>
all hollow profiles are selected having identical wall<br>
thicknesses in order to avoid different temperature<br>
profiles during the quenching procedure. Only some of the<br>
holes 4 are provided with reference numbers.<br>
Accelerations and inertial forces may be absorbed better<br>
through the diagonally running rack struts 5. The corner<br>
supports 6 are connected at their lower end to the rest 3<br>
and have a centering tip 7 at their upper end. When<br>
multiple annealing rack elements 1 are stacked one on top<br>
of another, the centering tips 7 of the particular lower<br>
annealing rack element 1 engage in corresponding recesses<br>
of the rest 3 of the particular upper annealing rack<br>
element 1. These recesses are not shown. The centering<br>
aids 7 allow secure stacking and unstacking. In the event<br>
of dynamic loads during the transport, slipping and<br>
upsetting of the stacked annealing rack elements 1 is<br>
prevented.<br>
A transport switching flag 8 in the form of an oblong<br>
sheet is positioned between two corner supports 6. This<br>
transport switching flag 8 is also detachably attached<br>
using bolts and cotter pin. It is detected by light<br>
barriers (not shown) and the position of the annealing<br>
rack is detected for the process controller on the basis<br>
of this. For precise identification of an annealing rack,<br>
an identification switching flag 17 is attached to one of<br>
the corner supports 6, from which the details on each of<br>
the individual annealing racks and/or the annealing stock<br>
transported therein are readable. The function of the<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
positioning profile 9 illustrated is explained in the<br>
following for Figure 3.<br>
The side view shown in Figure 2 shows a long horizontal<br>
rest profile 10 having holes 11 as a part of the rest 3,<br>
as well as rack struts 5 and corner supports 6 having<br>
centering aids 7. The long rest profile 10 has a greater<br>
height than the short rest profile 2. Only some of the<br>
holes 11 are provided with reference numbers.<br>
In the top view shown in Figure 3, the construction of<br>
the rest 3 having two short rest profiles 2 and two long<br>
rest profiles 10 may be seen. Only some of the holes 4<br>
and 11 are marked with reference numbers. Four corner<br>
supports 6 having centering aids 7 are located in the<br>
four corners of the rest 3. The long rest profiles 10 are<br>
connected to one another via the positioning profile 9.<br>
The positioning profile 9 has three square holes 12 . As<br>
may be seen from Figures 5 and 10, the basket supports 18<br>
are inserted into the square holes 12. More detailed<br>
explanations in this regard are in the following<br>
descriptions of the corresponding figures.<br>
Figures 4 through 6 correspond to Figures 1 through 3.<br>
They additionally have an annealing basket 13 which is<br>
inserted into an annealing rack element 1. The basket<br>
floor 14 comprises two short floor profiles 15, which are<br>
positioned parallel and at a distance to one another and<br>
between which four long floor profiles 16 are positioned.<br>
The long floor profiles 16 lie on the shorter rest<br>
profiles 2 and the positioning profile 9. In this case,<br>
the positioning profile 9 is not only used for laying<br>
down the annealing basket 13. The three square holes 12<br><br>
- 11-<br>
additionally allow the passage of three basket supports<br>
18	of the annealing basket 13. These&gt; basket supports 18<br>
and the positioning profile 9 are implemented as hollow<br>
profiles. The basket supports 18 are fixed solely by<br>
gravity in the square holes 12. The annealing basket 13<br>
may be raised easily out of the annealing rack element 1<br>
after the heat treatment process. Upwardly projecting<br>
basket supports 18 are positioned on the basket floor 14.<br>
The basket supports 18 are connected to one another via<br>
basket struts 19, the long basket struts 19 covering the<br>
long floor profiles 16 in the top view shown in Figure 6.<br>
Since the rest 3, the corner supports 6, and the rack<br>
struts 5 of the annealing rack elements 1, and the basket<br>
floor 14, the basket supports 18, and the basket struts<br>
19	of the annealing basket 13 are all produced either<br>
from multiply perforated hollow profiles of identical<br>
wall thickness or from flat steel, the annealing stock<br>
may be cooled rapidly and uniformly during the quenching<br>
process. The flat steel cools down rapidly upon contact<br>
with cold water and the coolant liquid, usually water,<br>
may additionally penetrate extremely rapidly into the<br>
hollow profiles through the multiple holes in the hollow<br>
profiles. In this case, the selection of identical wall<br>
thicknesses encourages uniform cooling.<br>
The wire clip shown will be discussed in greater detail<br>
in Figure 9.<br>
Each part may be replaced individually as needed through<br>
the plug-in connections and/or screw connections. No<br>
complete annealing rack elements 1 have to be kept ready.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
A small reserve is completely sufficient, this only-<br>
occupying a small space in the disassembled state.<br>
The detail w from Figure 6 is shown enlarged in Figure 7.<br>
In this case, the plug-in connection of three parts of<br>
the annealing basket 13 is shown. Using this plug-in<br>
connection, a short floor profile 15 is detachably<br>
connected to a long basket strut 19 running<br>
perpendicularly thereto and, in addition, to a basket<br>
support 18, which projects upward perpendicularly from<br>
the basket floor 14.<br>
For this purpose, the short floor profiles 15 have a<br>
rectangular hole 20, into which the lower end of the<br>
upwardly projecting basket support 18 is inserted with<br>
play. This basket support 18 is drilled through above its<br>
insertion region and the long basket strut 19 is inserted<br>
through this hole with play. Therefore, this long basket<br>
strut 19 lies on the short floor profile 15. The long<br>
basket strut 19 is secured at its inserted end with play<br>
using a cotter pin 21. The three parts of the annealing<br>
basket are therefore equipped with a certain mobility in<br>
the assembled state, through which the stability of the<br>
basket is not negatively influenced and the basket may<br>
manage tensions during the heat treatment and dynamic<br>
loads well.<br>
The detail x from Figure 1 is shown enlarged in Figure 8.<br>
The plug-in connection of three parts of the annealing<br>
rack element is recognizable here.<br>
Using this plug-in connection, a long rest profile 10 is<br>
detachably connected to a short rest profile 2 of the<br><br>
-13-<br>
rest 3 and to a corner support 6. In this case, each of<br>
the three parts is oriented perpendicularly to each of<br>
the two other parts.<br>
The long rest profile 10 is implemented having a greater<br>
height than the short rest profile 2. The long rest<br>
profile 10 has a first hole 22, in which a short rest<br>
profile 2 is inserted, in the region of one end, but at a<br>
distance thereto on the side facing toward the interior<br>
of the rest 3.<br>
The long rest profile 10 has a second hole 23 in the<br>
region of one end, but at a distance thereto. This second<br>
hole 23 is applied to the upper face of the long rest<br>
profile 10. The basket support 6 is inserted through this<br>
second hole 23. Its lower end comes to rest on the short<br>
rest profile 2, which is also inserted.<br>
Two diametrically opposite retaining holes 24 and 24' are<br>
positioned in the region of the lower end of the corner<br>
support 6, but at a distance to this end. At the same<br>
height, the long rest profile 10 also has a retaining<br>
hole 25 and 25' on each side. The retaining holes 24, 24'<br>
and 25, 25' in the long rest profile 10 and in the corner<br>
supports 6 are positioned flush. A retaining bolt 26 is<br>
inserted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
inserted short rest profile 2 through these retaining<br>
holes 24, 24', 25, and 25'. The retaining bolt 26 is<br>
secured using a retaining cotter pin 27.<br>
The strut bolt 28 having strut cotter pin 29 is used for<br>
the purpose of detachably connecting a rack strut 5 to<br>
the long rest profile 10 and the corner support 6.<br><br>
- 14-<br>
Through the retaining bolts 26 and strut bolts 28 having<br>
assigned cotter pins 27 and 29, the rest profiles 2 and<br>
10, the corner supports 6, and the rack struts 5 are<br>
secured with play.<br>
The detail y from Figure 6 is shown enlarged in Figure 9.<br>
In this case, the plug-in and screw connections of wire<br>
clips 30 to a long floor profile 16 of the basket floor<br>
14 may be seen. In this case, the wire clips 30 shown are<br>
inserted into or through holes of the long floor profiles<br>
16. The wire clips 30 inserted through are screwed onto<br>
the free ends of the wire clips 30 using self-locking<br>
nuts 31. The wire clips 30 are specially shaped. They are<br>
used for centering aluminum parts during the automatic<br>
loading and unloading procedure. The wire clips 30 are<br>
tailored to the particular aluminum component to be held.<br>
The aluminum component is not shown.<br>
The detail z from Figure 4 is shown enlarged in Figure<br>
10. In this case, a plug-in connection for fixing an<br>
annealing basket 13 on the annealing rack element 1 is<br>
shown.<br>
For this purpose, the positioning profile 9 of the<br>
annealing rack element is provided with two diametrically<br>
opposite square holes 12 on its top and bottom in such a<br>
way that a basket support 1 of an annealing basket 13 may<br>
be inserted through. In this case, the basket support 18<br>
of the annealing basket 13 is implemented as a vertical<br>
hollow profile, whose diameter is slightly smaller than<br>
the diameter of the two holes 12. In the state inserted<br>
through, regions of the basket floor 14 lie directly on<br>
the upper side of the positioning profile 9.<br><br>
-15-<br>
The use of the low-distortion annealing rack according to<br>
the present invention is to be explained in the following<br>
on the basis of an example:<br>
The annealing baskets are charged with the stock to be<br>
treated, particularly aluminum cast parts for the<br>
automobile field. The charging is typically performed<br>
automatically. For this purpose, the baskets are already<br>
in the annealing rack element or are raised therein after<br>
charging. Baskets which are only self-supporting in the<br>
empty state, but not with annealing stock inserted, are<br>
generally used. Even annealing stock having very<br>
complicated geometry may be fixed well by the wire clips.<br>
The advantage of this division is that these baskets may<br>
be adapted easily to the components and the simply<br>
designed, stable annealing rack elements assume the<br>
supporting function. After an automatic stacking of this<br>
type of multiple annealing rack elements, the annealing<br>
rack is introduced into the furnace via transport rollers<br>
or transport chains. For this purpose, the annealing rack<br>
has an at least largely planar bottom. The stock is now<br>
annealed in the furnace. Subsequently, it is immersed in<br>
a quenching basin which is filled with water, then<br>
removed from the basin and made available for further<br>
treatment. The individual treatment stages in the furnace<br>
and subsequently in the quenching basin are automated in<br>
such a way that automatic recognition units determine the<br>
current position of the annealing rack and gripping units<br>
may grip exactly. The annealing rack may also not have<br>
any deformations, so that these positions may be detected<br>
correctly.<br><br>
