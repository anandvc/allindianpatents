SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of electrical and mechanical pumps is known in the prior art. More specifically, electrical and mechanical pumps heretofore devised and utilized arc known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.<br>
There are many types of pumps available and they are part of day-to-day life. Generally, all the pumps are operated on electrical energy. In case of non-availability of electrical energy, these water pumps have no other mechanism provided which operate these pump. Moreover, the maintenance poses a huge problem due to lack of knowledge regarding operation and maintenance of the pumps. Also, a lot of skill and expertise is required to install a water pump which may not be readily available in small towns and villages especially in remote areas. Therefore, it is urgent need to develop a different type of pump, which can operate on two or three different types of energy sources, should be simple in construction, should be light in weight and durable, should be easy to install, should require less maintenance and should achieve maximum efficiency.<br>
This invention describes such type of pneumatic air rotor driven water pump which is suitable for Indian conditions and satisfies all the characteristics mentioned above.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1-shows the main schematic diagram for the arrangement of Pneumatic Pressure Drive Water Pump.<br>
Numeral 1 &amp; 2: Air Compressor:<br>
Numeral 3: Air Tank of required size for collection of pressurized air<br>
Numeral 4: Pressure Air Inlet pipe, which provides pressurized air to pneumatic rotor<br><br><br>
Numeral 5: Pneumatic Rotor <br>
Numeral 6: Impeller of water pump <br>
Numeral 7: Outlet of pressurized air Numeral 8: Delivery Pipe of water pump<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This pneumatic rotor driven water pump is basically operated by air pressure with high efficiency. The detailed description of pump and required parts to develop this pump is follows-<br>
The Figure 1 shows air compressor (Numerals 1 &amp; 2) with minimum 90 psi rating, with different mechanical arrangements, so that it can be either operated from electrical energy, wind energy, animal energy or can be operated manually.<br>
Numeral 3 represents air tank of required size for collection of pressurized air. The shape and size of air tank can be used considering the desired output.<br>
Numeral 4 shows Pressure Air Inlet Pipe, which provides pressurized air to pneumatic rotor (5) driven water pump. This pressurized air provided to pneumatic rotor rotates the rotor at high speed.<br>
Numeral 5 shows the Pneumatic Rotor which has spiral flanges with vertical axis. Speed of pneumatic rotor depends upon air pressure and quantity of entered in to inlet of rotor. This rotor is approximately weightless and hence provides easy installation. This rotor is maintenance free as there is no electrical connections or equipment used and therefore all<br><br><br>
problems related with electrical motors do not surface in this invention. Also, due to the unique rotor, the problem of water seal and rusting becomes negligible. As rotor can achieve very high mechanical speed; unlike electric motor drive the delivery section dimensions are automatically reduced.<br>
Numeral 6 is Impeller of water pump, a mechanical device that forces the water in delivery section and is made of fiber material or cast iron.<br>
Numeral 7 is Outlet of pressurized air and it allows the pressurized air to go back to nature. The special arrangement is made of this outlet so that the discharge is increased naturally. The shape and size of outlet pipe can be designed as per the requirement.<br>
Numeral 8 is Delivery Pipe of water pump, through which water is taken outside. Due to such type of design of water pump, the weight of delivery pipe gets reduced and size can be selected as per the discharge required.<br><br>
The present invention discloses a pneumatic air rotor driven water pump (Fig. 1) comprising a pair of air compressor (Numerals 1 &amp; 2) which are interconnected with a hollow pipe so as to carry the compressed air to air tank (Numeral 3) wherein the air tank which is connected to the air compressor at one end and also to the pneumatic rotor (Numeral 5) on the other end by a pressure air inlet pipe (Numeral 4) and which provides pressurized air compressed by the two air compressors and which is stored in the air tank to the pneumatic rotor which is connected to the impeller (Numeral 6) of the water pump and which rotates as per the air pressure provided to it by the pressure air inlet pipe wherein the impeller<br><br><br>
of water pump is a mechanical device that forces the water in the delivery section by the rotations of the rotor caused by the air which enters the inlet of the rotor due to the air pressure formed by the air compressors and supplied to the rotor via the pressure air inlet pipe wherein a outlet (Numeral X) of pressurized air is provided to allow the pressurized air to be realized in the air once the pressurized air performs it function of impelling water in the pump and wherein a delivery pipe (Numeral 8) is provided into which the water flows due to the mechanism of the impeller which pumps the water out.<br><br><br>
