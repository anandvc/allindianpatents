				<td>[0001] The present invention relates to an aqueo is solution for the use as<br>
medium for the specific binding reaction of a binding pair,<br>
[OOOP] Background of the invention<br>
[0003] Immunoassays where one or more antibodies are used to detect the<br>
test substance (analyte) in a test sample are widely known. The evolution of<br>
immunoassay methods increased the sensitivity of this test. Despite of the<br>
developments within the recent decades, there remans a desire to eliminate<br>
unspecific binding reactions, cross-reactivities and the influence of the compounds<br>
present in the matrix.<br>
[0004] Immunoassays depend upon the ability of i first binding member of a<br>
binding member pair, e.g. an antigen or a ligand, to specifically bind to a second<br>
binding member of a binding member pair, e.g. an antibody or a receptor. In order<br>
to determine the extend of such binding, a conjugate, comprising one of such<br>
binding members are labeled with a detectable moiety Such binding member<br>
pairs can be an antigen and an antibody directed to such an antigen.<br>
[0005] Immunoassays can be performed in a competitive immunoassay<br>
format or in a sandwich immunoassay format. In the competitive immunoassay<br>
format an antigen can be immobilized to a solid phase material whereby the<br>
amount of detectable moiety that is bound to a solic phase material can be<br>
detected, measured and correlated to the amount of antibody present in the test<br>
sample. Examples of solid phase materials include beads, particles, micro-<br>
particles and the like. In the sandwich immunoassa format a test sample,<br>
containing for example an antibody, is contacted with a protein such as an antigen.<br>
The antigen is immobilized on a solid phase material. Examples of solid phase<br>
materials include bear is, particles, micro-particles and the like. The solid phase<br>
material is typically cleated with a second antigen or antibody that has been<br>
labeled with a detectable moiety. The second antigen or antibody, respectively,<br>
then becomes bound to the corresponding antibody or antigen, respectively, on<br>
the solid phase mater al and, after one or more washing steps, to remove any<br>
unbound material an indicator material such as a chromogenic substance, is<br>
introduced to react wi h the detectable moiety to produce the detectable signal,<br>
e.g. a color change. The color change is then detected, measured and correlated<br>
to the amount of antibody present in the test sample. It should also be noted that<br>
 various dilutents and suffers are also required to optimize the operation of the<br>
micro-particles, antige is, conjugates and other components of the assay that<br>
participate in chemical 'eactions.<br>
[0006] In order o achieve optimal results in immunoassays the solution<br>
which is used for the binding reactions between the binding partners (for example<br>
 the antibody and antige n reaction or the complex formation of ligand and receptor)<br>
must provide a mediim that optimizes the ability of antibodies to bind to the<br>
antigen, or must provide a medium that optimizes the ability of ligands to bind to<br>
the receptor, while non-specific interactions, low-affinity binding and matrix effects<br>
are strongly reduced o even prevented in order to avoid the generation of a false<br>
 signal.<br>
[0007] In order to eliminate non-specific interactions and cross-reactivities<br>
detergents have been edded to buffers which are used for washing steps after the<br>
binding reaction in order to remove unspecific bindings.<br>
[0008] For immunoassays, like western-blot analyses, enzyme-linked<br>
 immuno-sorbant assa (ELISA) and others, solutions containing phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS)! upplemented with bovine serum albumin and 0.01 to 0.05<br>
(v/v) Tween 20 is use i as medium for the binding reactions between the binding<br>
partners (for example antibody and antigen). It is, however, very often experienced<br>
that unspecific or low-affinity binding, cross-reactivities and matrix effects can not<br>
be avoided with such buffers of the state of art. For example, when developing a<br>
CRP-assay involving the detection of a plurality of analytes it appeared that cross-<br>
reactivities due to the use of the plurality of antibodies as well as matrix effects<br>
became a problem, which could not be solved by the use of conventional<br>
 immunoassay buffers.<br>
[0009] The object of the present invention therefore was to provide a<br>
solution for the use as a medium for the specific bindi ig reaction of a binding<br>
member pair wherein the unspecific binding, low affinity binding, cress-reactivities<br>
and matrix effects are strongly reduced or even preventec. Furthermore, it was the<br>
 object of the present invention to provide a method of an immunoassay, wherein<br>
unspecific and low affinity binding, cross-reactivities and matrix effects are<br>
reduced or prevented.<br>
[0010] Summary of the invention<br>
[0011] The object of the present invention is solver by an aqueous solution<br>
 for use as medium for the specific binding reaction of a binding member pair,<br>
wherein a first binding member recognizes its complementary second binding<br>
member, the solution comprising<br>
a) a buffer to control pH;<br>
b) a compound A selected from the group consisting of:<br>
a compound defined by the general formula I<br>
R1-[[CRzR3]p~0]q-R'1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy group, R2 for<br>
each unit independently is hydrogen or hydroxy group, R3 is<br>
hydrogen, methyl group, ethyl group, R4 is hydrogen or alkyl group, p<br>
is an integer of from 2 to 10 and q is an intet er of from 1 to 100, with<br>
the proviso that the compound at least carries two hydroxy groups;<br>
polyol;<br>
saccharide;<br>
c) a non-ionic detergent.<br>
[0012] In case F4 in the general formula I of compound A is hydrogen the<br>
neighbouring residue Rz is also hydrogen. In case R1 is hydroxy group the<br>
neighbouring residue R2 is hydrogen. In a preferred embodiment q in the formula<br>
of compound A is an in :eger of from 1 to 50, more preferred from 1 to 30.<br>
[0013] The inventors of the present invention surprisingly have found that<br>
the aqueous solution according to the present invention reduces the cross-<br>
reactivities, matrix e fects, unspecific bindings and low affinity-binding in<br>
immunoassays. Furthermore, it was found that even effects due to heterophilic<br>
antibodies (human anti mouse-antibody) are prevented when the aqueous solution<br>
according to the present invention is used. Additionally, negative effects due to<br>
rheuma factors, hemoglobin, bilirubin and triglycerides can be avoided with this<br>
buffer even in case of plasma applications.<br>
[0014] As used lerein a "binding member pair" comprises a "first binding<br>
member" and a "seccnd binding member". Both binding members undergo a<br>
specific binding to eacli other. The first binding member of a binding member pair<br>
may be an antigen or aligand, respectively. The second binding member (e.g. an<br>
antibody or a receptor, respectively) specifically recognizes and binds to the first<br>
binding member (e.g. antigen or ligand, respectively). The second binding member<br>
is the corresponding binding member and therefore also named "corresponding<br>
binding member". The irtisan will understand that the terms "first" binding member<br>
and "second" binding nember, respectively, may be for example the antigen and<br>
the corresponding antit ody, respectively, or vice versa.<br>
[0015] The aque )us solution according to the present invention represents a<br>
universal buffer as a rr edium in immunoassays and binding reactions in a variety<br>
of matrices, for example blood plasma, blood serum and others. In case of mulli-<br>
analyie applications, for example, if protein chips are used, the simultaneous<br>
incubation of several (era plurality) of analytes and several antibodies, unspecillc<br>
bindings and cross-rea ;tivities very often occur. Such undesired binding reactions<br>
have been observed in many cases. The use of standard ELISA buffers known in<br>
the state of art could not prevent such cross-reactivity offects. In addition in the<br>
state of art, the use of native samples resulted in matrix effects which gave<br>
erroneous measurements compared to other methods for reference. As used<br>
herein the term "matrix" refers to all compounds presen: in a native sample, like<br>
blood scrum; in particular the term "matrix" refers to the Drganic and especially to<br>
biological compounds such as proteins.<br>
[0016] The aqueous solution according to the piesent invention may be<br>
used as medium for the binding reaction of a binding pair, as sample dilution<br>
buffers for immunoassays and binding reactions as well as dilution buffer for<br>
antibodies and antigens, respectively. Further applications are multi-analyte<br>
immunoassays and proteomics, wherein undesired cross-reactivities of antibodies<br>
labeled with the fluoraphor can be prevented. Fluorophor tabled antibodies tend to<br>
bind other proteins in an unspecific manner. By usirg the aqueous solution<br>
according to the present invention such effects can be avoided.<br>
[0017] By using the buffer according to the present invention in<br>
immunoassays like ELISA and protein chips a further positive effect was shown.<br>
When incubating the surface carrying the immobilized sntibodies with the buffer<br>
according to the present invention the activity of the immobilized antibodies was<br>
increased. This is resulting in an enhancement of the bin ting of the analyte to the<br>
immobilized antibody. In conclusion, the buffer according to the present invention<br>
in addition to the reduction of unspecific signals and unspecific effects also<br>
increases the specific signals due to a positive influence on the specific binding<br>
reaction between the analyte and the antibody. The resulting increase of the<br>
activity of the immobilized antibodies provides a higher se nsitivity of the respective<br>
assay.<br>
[0018] The buffer according to the present invention may be used for<br>
immunoassays ELISA, EIA, FIA, lateral-flow-test, protein chips, multi-analyte<br>
assays, western blots, dot blots, immunohistochemistn,, receptor-ligand-assays<br>
and immuno-PCR.<br>

up to 10'7 M and reducing the mid-range affinity binding with Kd values in the<br>
range of between 10"7 M and 10"° M by at least 90 lo compared to standard<br>
conditions. Even further preferred, the aqueous solution has the capability of<br>
preventing the low-affinity binding with KD values of up to 10"T and reducing the<br>

detection by immunoassay of at least one analyte to be tested, wherein the<br>
analyte to be tested is a first binding member of a bincing member pair, wherein<br>
i the first binding member binds specifically to its complementary binding member,<br>

bound to the complementary binding member, wherein the reagent<br>
(antibody) is conjugated to a means of detection; and<br>
d) optionally: reagents which are reactive with said means of detection<br>
to produce a detectable reaction product.<br>
. [0036] A typical kit for example is used as ELISA lit for the detection of, for<br>

Description of the/Figures<br>
[0042] Figure 1 shows the amount of detector ant body C6 bound to CRP in<br>
a sandwich assay as absorbance at 450 nm plotted acainst the concentration of<br>
CRP [ng/ml]. The binding reaction of detector antibody C6 to the protein CRP was<br>
performed as outlined under Example 1 under standari conditions and by using<br>
sample buffers according to the present invention, r<ispectively table></ispectively>
Sample buffers I to III according to the solution of the present invention reduce the<br>
influence of the matrix effects very well. Sample buffer I shows the best sensitivity.<br>
The low sensitivity of the reference buffer is caused by a strong matrix effect.<br>
[0043] Figure 2 shows the influence of two ilifferent buffers on high<br>
background signals caused by unspecific binding o the polyclonal detector<br>
antibody P2 which binds unspecific to the capture aitibody P3 (according to<br>
Example 2). In this experiment no analyte was present. .'Sample buffer I decreases<br>
significantly the unspecific binding compared to the higli background signals with<br>
reference example buffer!!.<br>
Examples<br>
[0044] Example 1: Reduction of matrix effects<br>
[0045] 100 ul diluted capture antibody C2 (final concentration 1 ug/ml in<br>
PBS-Buffer) was added to each well of a microtiter plnte (C8 StarWell Module,<br>
NUNC) and the plate was covered with a plate sealer The capture antibody is<br>
directed against CRP (c-reactive protein). Then the p ate was incubated for 5<br>
hours at room temperature. The plate sealer was rerr oved and the plate was<br>
washed 4 times with 300 ul washing buffer (10 mM Piosphate, 350 mM NaCI,<br>
0.05 % Tween, pH 7.') per well. Than 200 ul of blocking solution (PBS-Buffer pH<br>
7.4, 1 % BSA) was added to each well. After covering with a plate sealer the plate<br>
was incubated avernic ht at 4 °C. The analyte CRP (c-reactive protein) was diluted<br>
in rabbit serum (0-5 ng/ml) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The<br>
biotin-labelled detecto • antibody C6 (directed against CRP) was diluted in different<br>
sample buffers and reference example buffers (see table 1). The final<br>
concentration was 4 jjg/ml in each preparation. The CRP-containing rabbit serum<br>
standards were diluted 1:2 with detector antibody containing sample buffers. Tho<br>
preparations were incL bated for 30 min at room temperature. The plate sealer was<br>
removed and the plate was washed 4 times with 300 ul washing buffer. Oddments<br>
of washing buffer wen: completely removed by taping the plate dry. 100 pi of the<br>
CRP-preparations weia added to the wells. The plate was covered with a plate<br>
sealer and incubated far 4 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. After that<br>
the plate was wash 3d again. 100 ul of diluted NeutrAvidin™'-Horseradish<br>
peroxidase ccnjugatec (final concentration 0,05 ug/ml in PBS-Buffer) was added<br>
to each well. The plat j was incubated for 1 h at room temperature under gentle<br>
shaking. Then the plat a was washed again. Equal volumes of the two solutions of<br>
lmmunoPure©TMB Sibstrat were mixed and 100 pi were added immediately to<br>
each well. The plate vas incubated at room temperature until the desired colour<br>
developed. The colou' changed from clear to brilliant blue. In a final step the<br>
reaction was stoppec by adding 150 pi 2 M H2S04 to each well and the<br>
absorbance was read out at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Molecular<br>
devices). The influence of different buffers on matrix effects are plotted in fig. 1.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of the test. In table 1 the reduction of non-specific<br>
binding, low-affinity binding and matrix effects is indicated in the column "result"<br>
with "+". The number of"+" is indicating the amount of reduction of non-specific<br>
binding, low-affinity binding and matrix effects compared to the reference example<br>
buffer ("-"). Figure 1 stows the amount of detector antibody C6 bound to CRP as<br>
absorbance at 450 nrr plotted against the concentration of CRP [ng/ml]. Sample<br>
buffer I shows the be; t sensitivity. The low sensitivity of the reference buffer is<br>
caused by a strong ma rix effect.<br>
[0046] Example 2: Reduction of an unspecifk binding of a polyclonal<br>
detector antibody<br>
[0047] For the next assay 250 pi diluted captu 'e antibody P3 (polyclonal<br>
rabbit-anti-protease, own preparation, final concentra'ion 1 g/ml in PBS-Buffer)<br>
i was added to each well of a microtiter plate (C8 StarW 2ll Module, NUNC) and the<br>
plate was covered with a plate sealer. The plate was inc ubated for 4 hours at room<br>
temperature- After that the plate sealer was removed a id the plate was washed 4<br>
times with 300 pi washing buffer (10 mM Phosphato, 350 mM NaCI, 0.05 %<br>
Tween®, pH 7.4) per well. Then 200 pi of blocking solitlon (PBS-Buffer pH 7.4, 1<br>
i % BSA) was added to each well. The plate was covered again with a plate sealer<br>
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The biotin-labelled p Dlyclonal detector antibody<br>
P2 (polyclonal rabbit-anti-protease, own preparation) was diluted in reference<br>
example buffer II or in sample buffer I (see taMe 1) respectively (final<br>
concentration 10 ug/ml in each preparation) and added to the wells (250 pi per<br>
well; fivefold replicates). The plate was incubated for 2 I at room temperature. The<br>
plate sealer was removed and the plate was washed 4 times with 300 pi washing<br>
buffer. Oddments of washing buffer were completely removed by taping the plate<br>
dry. 250 pi of diluted NeutrAvidin71'-Horseradish peroxidase conjugated (final<br>
concentration 0,5 pg/ml in PBS-Buffer) was added to each well. The plate was<br>
incubated for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Then the plate was<br>
washed again. Equal volumes of the two solutions of lrnmunoPum®TMB Substrat<br>
were mixed and 100 pi were added immediately to ?ach well. The plate was<br>
Incubated at room temperature until the desired cobur develops. The colour<br>
changes from clear to brilliant blue. In a final step the reaction was stopped by<br>
. adding 150 pi 2 M H2SO4 to each well and the absorban ;e was read out at 450 nm<br>
with an ELISA plate reader (Molecular devices). The inlluence of the two different<br>
buffers on high background signals caused by unspecif c binding of the polyclonal<br>
detector antibody P2 which binds unspecifically to th= capture antibody P3 is<br>
plotted in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows the reduction of background signals due to the<br>
use of sample buffer I according to the present invent on. In this experiment no<br>
analyte was used. Further, as antibody a polyclonal serum was used. A polyclonal<br>
serum comprises many different antibodies directed against a target protein. Many<br>
antibodies will bind with low or lower affinity, while some antibodies will bind with<br>
mid-range affinity anc one or only a few antibodies will bind with high affinity. The<br>
use of the buffer accc rding to the invention prevents the low-affinity binding and at<br>
least reduces the mid-range affinity binding of the respective antibodies as shown<br>
in Figure 2. As a resu t, once an analyte will be added in such an assay the signal-<br>
to noise-ratio will be improved due to the properties of the aqueous solution<br>
according to the prese nt invention.<br>
