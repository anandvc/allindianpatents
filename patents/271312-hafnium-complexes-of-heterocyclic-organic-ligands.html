CROSS REFERENCF. STATEMENT<br>
This applicarion claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Applications 60/798,108, filed May 5, 2006.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to certain hafnium complexes, to catalyst compositions comprising the same, and io iiddilion polymsrizaiiun processes, especially olcHp polymeriiation processes, using such hafnium complexes as one component of a coordination p jiymerizaiton catalyst composition.<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties, useful in a ivide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of<br><br><br><br><br>
Additionally, according to the present invention there is provided a calaiys! composition comprising one or fTiore of (he foregoing hafnium compiexes of formula 11) and a.n aciivaung cocatalysi capable of convening sdid metal complex into an active catalyst for addition polymerization. Additional components of such catalyst composition may include a carrier or support, a liquid solvent or diluent, a tertiary component such as a scavenger or secondary activator, and/or one or more additives or adjuvants such as processing aids, iiequestranis, chain transfer agents, and/or chain shuttling agents.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides an addition polymerization process, especially an oiefm polymerization process, wherein one or more addition polymerizable monomers are polymerized in the presence of the foregoing catalyst composition, including the preferred and more preferred embodiments thereof, to form a high molecular weight polymer. Preferred polymerization processes are soltition polymerizations, most preferably solution processes wherein ethylene, propylene, mixtures of ethylene and propylene, or mixtures of ethylene and/or propylene with one or more C4.20 olefins or diolefins are polymenzed or copolymerized.  Desirably, the processes are capable of operation at high polymerization temperatures to prepare polymers having desirable physical propertie;..<br>
Highly desirably, the present invention pro "-'ides a process wherein oflc or more addition poKmeriz^ble monomfcr&gt; arr potvmerized at a rclativeiv h.sX) r-civrnerizaticr, ierrrr-sriiiuri in ;lis presence of the forego ins; c.-itjlys.! composinoii '0 form a his!^ n'o'ecolar weiglu r^c!ic poi vmf. especially a polynner that is isotaciic or highly isotactic. with improved operating efriciency and the u.se of non-aromatic solvents. Additionally the present inventors have discovered improved techniques for synthesizing high purity formylimidazoles, a new class cf stable borate esters of alkyIbenzofurans. and high purity bromoalkylbenzofurans.<br>
The metal complexes arid catalysts of the invention mav be used alone or combined with other metal complexes or catalyst compositions and the polymerization process may be used in scries or in parallel with one or more other polymerization processes. Suitable additional polymerization catalyst compositions for use in combination with the metal complexes of the present invention include conventional Ziegler-Natta-type transition metal polymerization catalysis as well a^ Ji-bonded transition metal cofnpounds such as meiallocene-iype caspl.vsis, constrained geometry or other transition metal complexes, including other donor ligand complexes.<br>
The metal complexes of the invention are preferred for use as components of olefin polymerization catalysts because they are capable of producing polymers at higher reactor temperatures while utilizing aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents to convey them inio the reactor. An additional advantage of the present invention is the ability to prepare the metal complexes in extremely high purity and consequeni high activity due to nearly complete removal of<br><br>
meial salts, especially magnesium salt by-products from the syiitSiesis. through iriiuraiion or washing with aliphatic hydrocartxins.   Another advantage is the ability in prepare propylene homopolymers or propylene/ethylene inierpolymers containing 6.5 percent or more polymerized propylene moieiies while retaining relatively high isotacticity, Tne polymers and copolymers of the invention possess improved toughness, making them well suited for use in injection molding applications as well as for use in preparing fibers, especially by means of mett-blown or extrusion spinning processes.   Moreover, the polymers are usefully employed in adhesive formulations or in multi-layer films and laminates demonstrating improved compatibility and adhesion to polyethylene substrates, layers or films.<br>

Unless stated to the contrary, clear from the context, orconventiona! in the art. all parts and percentsare ha.sed on wajgfii.  .Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the IUPAC syssstn for numbering groups.<br>
The ierm "comprising" and dcrivati\es thereof ii 
The term "heiero" or "hetero-atom" refers to a non-carbon atom, especially Si, B, N. P, S, or O. "Heieroaryl", "heieroalkyl", "heterocycloalky!" and "heteroaralkyl" refer to aryl, alky!, cycloalkyl, or aralkyi groups respectively, in which at least one carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom. "Inertly substituted" refers to substituents on a ligand that neither destroy uperability of the invention nor the iigand's identity. For example, an alkoxy group is not a substituted alkyi group   Preferred inert substituents are halo, di(C|.e hydrocarbyOatnino. Ci^ hydrocarbyleneamino, C|.6 halohydrocarbyl, and tri(C,^ hydrocarhyl)si)yl. The term "'alkyl' is usc^i to signify a monovalent hydrocarbyl ligand of the formula, CnH2„+i. The term "alkylation" refers to a chemical process by which an alkyi or substituted alkyl group is incorporated into an organic or organometallic compound. The term "polymer", as used herein, includes both homopolymers, that<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

One suitable technique for measuring polymer thermal properties is by means of differential scanning calorimeiry (DSC).  General principles of DSC measurements and application.^ of DSC to Studying crystalline poiymers are described in standard texts such as, E. A. Tun. ed.. "Thermal Characierization of Polymeric Materials", Academic Press, (19811. A suitable lecbnique for conducting DSC analyses is by using a model QiOOO DSC device from TA instruments. Inc. To calibrate the instrument, first a baseline is obtained by running the DSC from -90 "C to 290 "C without any sample in the aluminum DSC pan. Then 7 grams of a fresh indium sample is analyzed<br><br>
by heating the sample to 180 "C, cooling the sample to 140 "C ai a cooling rate of iO "C/min followed by keeping the sample isothermally ai 140'^C for 1 minute, followed bv heacing the sample from 140 °C to 180 "C at a healing raie of 10 "C/min, The heat of fusion and the onset of melting of the indium sample are determined and checked to be within 0,5 °C frorr^ 156.6 °C for ihs onset of melting and within 0,5 J/g from 28.71 J/g for the iieat of fusion.  Then deinniT-^.d water is analyzed by cooling a small drop of fresh sample m the DSC pan from 25 "C to -30 '^C at a cooling rate of IO°C/min. Ttie sample is retained at -30 °C for 2 mmutes and heated to 30 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The onset of melting is determined and checked to be within 0.5 °C from 0 '^C,<br>
The samples are prepared by pressing the polymer imo a ihin film at a temperature of 100 "C,  About 5 to 8 mg of film sample is weighed and placed m the DSC pan. The iid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere, The sample pan is placed in the DSC ceil and then heated at a rate of about 100'C/min to a temperature of about 30 °C above the melt temperature. The sample is kepr at this temperature for about 3 minutes then cooled at a rate of 10 "C/min to ^0 'C, and held at that temperature for 3 minutes. Next the sample is again heated at a rare of !0 '-"Cmm until melting is complete. The resulting enthalpy curves are analyzed for peak melt temperature, onset and peak crystallization lemperarures. heat of fusion, and hea; of crystallization<br>

Polymers having a broadened melting point have t&gt;een found to be highly useful in applications requiring a combination of elaslit;ity and high temperature performance, such as elasEomeric fibers or adhesives, for example.<br>
One characteristic in the DSC curve of propylene/ethylene polymers possessing a relatively broad melting point is that the T„, the temperature at which the melting ends, reiuaiiis essentially the same and Tnm. the peak melting temperature, decreases as the amount of ethylene in the copolymer is increased. An additional feature of such polymers is that the skewness of the TREF curve IS generally greater than -i.6U, more pi^ferably greater than -1,00.<br>
The determination of crystallizable sequence length distribution in a copolymer can be measured by the technique oF temperature-rising elution fractionation (TT?£F), as disclosed by L, Wild, et al.. Journal of Polvmer Science: Polymer. Physics Ed.. 20,441 (1982), Hazlitt. Jour^o/<br><br><br><br>
The vaiue, T™,, is defined as the temperature of the largsst weight fraction eluting between 50 and 90 "C in the TREF curve. T, and w, are the elution ^empe^atu^s and weight fraction respectively of an arbitrary, i* fraction in the TREF disiribuiion. The distributions are normaiized (the sutn of the w, equals 100 percent) w\{h respect to the lota! area of thccur'vc L^luimg above 30 °C. Thus, the index reflects only the propenies of the crystallized polymer and any influence due to uncrystallized polymer (polymer still in solution at or belou/ 30 "O is omitted from tne calculation.<br>
Certain of the jjolymers according to the invention having a relatively broad mehing point on the DSC curve desirably are characterized by a skewness indfc!( greater than -1.6, more preferably greater than -1.2.<br>

A catalytic amount (10 mg) of p-(oluenesu!fonic acid is added to the reaction flask. The reactor is equipped with a Dean Stark trap with a condenser and a thermocouple well. The mixture is heated to I 10 "C under N^ for 12 hours.  The solvent is then<br><br><br><br><br><br>
toluene. To this solution is added 0.35 mmol of solid HfCU. The flask is Filted with art air-cooiea reflux condenser and the mixture heated at reflux for 4 hours. After cooling, 1.23 mmol of BuMgCI (3-5 equivalents, 2.0 M solution in diethyl ether) is added by syringe and tlie resulting mixture Stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Solvent (lolcenc and diethyl ether) is removed from the reaction mixture by vacuum. Hexane (30 mL) is added to the residue, then removed by filtration, and the solids washed again with additional hexane (30 mL). The white glassy solid product is recovered from the combined hexane extracts and converted to the dibutyl derivative by heaimg in benzene solution at 50 "C overnight.<br>
The solubility of the complex in methylcyclohexane measured at 20 °C is greater than 5 percent.<br>

Batch Reactor Propylene Homopolymerizations<br>
Polymerizations are conducted in a computer controlled, stirred, jacketed I S L siainlei;? steel autoclave solution batch reactor. The bottom of the reactor is fitted with a large orifice botfom discharge valve, which empties the reactor contents into a 6 L siainles; ste^l conii:iner   Th^ container is vented to a 30 gal. blowdown tank, with both the container and the tank are purged with nitrogen.  .-Mi chemicals used for polymerization or catalyst makeup are run through purification columns, to remove any impurities. Propylene and solvents are passed through 2 columns, the first containing alumina, the second containing a purifying reactant (Q5''^ available from Englehardt Corporation). Nitrogen and hydrogen gases are passed through a single column conlaining Q5^" reactant.<br>
The autoclave is cooled to 50 "C before loading. It is charged with 667 g mixed alkanes,<br>
hydrogen (using a calibrated 50 mL shot tank and a differential pressure in the shot lank of<br>
0.4!MPa). followed by 286g of propylene using a micro-motior flowmeter. The reactor is then<br>
brought to 90 "C before addition of catalyst composition.	"<br>
The metal complex (catalyst) is employed as a 0.20 mM solution in toluene (run I), as 75.0 mg dissolved in 675 mg methylcyclohexane (run 2), or as 75.0 mg dissolved in a mixture of 659 mg<br><br><br>
