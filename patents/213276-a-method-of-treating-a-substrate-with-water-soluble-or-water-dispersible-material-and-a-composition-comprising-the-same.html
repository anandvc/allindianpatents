TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A METHOD OF TREATING A SUBSTRATE WITH WATER-SOLUBLE<br>
OR WATER-DISPERSIBLE MATERIAL AND A COMPOSITION COMPRISING<br>
THE SAME<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913 of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br>
16 JAN 2004<br><br>
Treatment for Substrates<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a material comprising a benefit agent and a deposition aid for deposition of the benefit agent onto a substrate. It further relates to a method of depositing a benefit agent from solution or dispersion, onto a substrate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, such as a fabric, is well known in the art. In laundry applications typical "benefit agents" include fabric softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, sunscreens; and the like. Deposition of a benefit agent is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric softening to impart desirable properties to the fabric substrate.<br>
Conventionally the deposition.of the benefit agent may rely upon the attractive forces between the oppositely charged substrate and the benefit agent. Typically this requires the addition of benefit agents during the rinsing step of a treatment process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged chemical species present in the treatment compositions. For example, cationic fabric conditioners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in laundry washing compositions.<br>
Such adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite-charge to that of the benefit agent. For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus<br>
2<br><br>
requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it. Often the substantivity of the benefit agent is reduced and/or the deposition rate of the material is reduced because of the presence of incompatible charged species in the compositions.<br>
The deterging nature of laundry wash compositions also places severe limitations upon the inclusion of neutral but hydrophobic or oily benefit agents which are not effectively deposited in the presence of surfactant.<br>
Alternatively, when deposition of a conventional benefit agent is effected by mechanisms that do not rely upon charge interaction but upon other non-covalent forces, for example soil release polymers, other problems may occur, namely where interaction of an anionic surfactant with the benefit agent can also make the material so negatively charged and/or soluble as to overcome the other attractive interactions.<br>
Furthermore, there is frequently another complication in achieving optimum deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, in that, the need for solubility of the benefit agent in the medium used to treat the substrate is in principle, incompatible with the requirement for the benefit agent-to deposit/adsorb onto the substrate.<br>
The present invention is directed towards materials for solving one or more of the above problems.<br>
WO-A-98/00500 discloses detergent compositions comprising a peptide or protein deposition aid having a high affinity for fibres or a surface, and a benefit agent attached/adsorbed to the deposition aid. However, this deposition aid does not cha"nge chemically such as to increase its affinity for the substrate during the treatment process.<br>
3<br><br>
The present invention relates to materials for achieving initial solubility or dispersibility in the medium used to treat the substrate and effective deposition of one or more benefit-endowing groups thereon,<br>
GB-A-1 03 1 484 discloses stable aqueous dispersions of elastic copolymers which can be converted to cross-linked polymers by the action of heat or acid. They can be used to produce films or covering layers. However, none of the compounds has a benefit agent attached to the deposition enhancing part. There is no disclosure of using these materials in methods of laundry or fabric care.<br>
US-A-5 730 760 discloses a process of fabric washing in which a dye redeposition inhibiting agent is used. The dye redeposition inhibiting polymer used is of a specific type, being produced by polymerising, for example, vinylester monomers. There is not any mention of materials having any surface substantive properties nor is there a description of any reaction by which such surface substantive properties increase during use.<br>
WO-A-92/13114 discloses hair fixative polymers which form a film after application. The polymers are fundamentally different from those of the present invention in that they do not comprise a deposition part attached to a benefit agent. The polymeric material has no particular affinity for hair - it is just applied onto it. There is certainly no mention of a reaction which increases the affinity. Any reaction which occurs leads to the cross-linking of polymer and the formation of film. It is not disclosed that the polymers should be water-soluble of dispersible - they are normally dissolved in an inert carrier such as alcohol.<br>
WO-A-95J3508 7 discloses a hair Fixative amphoteric polymer composition. It is insoluble in water but can be solubilised by use of neutralisers or solubilising alcohol/water mixtures. The polymers do not to undergo any reaction which increases their affinity for hair. There is no benefit agent attached to the polymer.<br>
4<br><br>
WO-A-98/29528 discloses cellulose ethers in which some substituents are (poly)alkoxylated, analogues of the latter in which the (poly)alkoxylated groups are terminated with a cationic moiety in the form of a quaternary ammonium group, and cellulose ethers in which some substituents are carboxylic acids in the salt form (i.e. the materials are essentially carboxymethylcellulose variants). None of these substituents in any variant is of a kind which would undergo a chemical change to enhance fabric affinity.<br>
WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions containing cellulosic based polymers to provide appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics. These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents "R" are bonded, i.e. they are attached to the rings via an ether linkage. The groups "R" can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxylic acid, ester or amide groups. Optionally, up to five alkyleneoxy groups may be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom. None of the pendant groups is a benefit agent group. However, at least some of these groups may undergo a chemical change such as hydrolysis, in the wash liquor. However no such change would result in an increased affinity for the fabric. On the contrary, because the "ester" group is configured with the carbonyl group closer to the polysaccharide than the oxygen atom (i.e. esters of carboxyalkyl groups), any hydrolysis will result in free acid substituents which will actually result in an increase in solubility and therefore, a decrease in affinity for the fabric.<br>
WO-A-99/14295 discloses structures analogous to those described in WO-A-99/14245 but in one alternative, the substituents "R" together with the oxygen on the saccharide ring, constitute pendant half-esters of certain dicarboxylic acids. A single example of such a material is given. Again, no pendant group is a benefit agent group. However, the dicarboxylic acid half-esters would tend to hydrolyse in the wash liquor and thereby increase affinity of the material for a cotton fabric. However, first, this mechanism of<br>
5<br><br>
Fourth, the structures described and claimed insofar as they have such half ester substituents, must also have substituents of the type which are carboxyalkyl groups or esters thereof, i.e. of the type also described in WO-A-99/14245. In the latter (ester) case, these would hydrolyse to the free acid form. The degree of substitution of the latter (0.2 to 2) is considerably higher than for tha half-ester groups and the resultant increase in solubility would easily negate any enhanced affinity for the fabric by hydrolysis of the half-ester groups.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a water-soluble or water-dispersible material having the genera] formula (1):-<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected benefit agent groups said benefit agent groups being selected from a fibre care, household care or personal care agent and at least one or more R groups are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br>
6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
OH	R12, P—<br>
wherein each R1 is independently selected from C1-20 preferably C1-6) alkyl, C2-20 (preferably C2-6) alkenyl (e.g. vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (e.g. phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from CM alkyl, C1.12 (preferably C1-12) alkoxy, hydroxy!, vinyl and phenyl groups;<br>
each R3 is independently selected from hydrogen and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;<br>
R3 is a bond or is selected from C1-4 allcylene, C2-4 alkenylene and C5.7 arylene (e.g. phenylene) groups, the carbon atoms in any of these being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C1-12 (preferably C1-4) alkoxy, vinyl, hydroxyl, halo and amine groups;<br>
7<br><br>
each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen, counter cations such as alkali metal<br>
.<br>
(preferably Na) or I Ca or I Mg, and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined; and<br>
groups R which together with the oxygen atom forming the linkage to the respective saccharide ring forms an ester or hemi-cster group of a tricarboxylic- or higher polycarboxylic- or other complex acid such as citric acid, an amino acid, a synthetic amino acid analogue or a protein.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention also provides a method of depositing a benefit agent onto a substrate by its incorporation in a material according to the first aspect of the invention and applying said material to the substrate.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention also provides compositions comprising a material according to the first aspect of the present invention. In particular, such compositions preferably comprise one or more surfactants and are suitable for use in washing applications such as laundry, personal washing, hand and machine dishwashing and household cleaning.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
8<br><br>
It is believed that the ester bonds which link the non-benefit pendant groups "R" to the polymer backbone hydrolyse to increase the affinity of the polymer for a substrate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
The Material<br>
The present invention requires the benefit agent group of the material to be attached to the deposition enhancing part by a hydrolytically stable bond. That means that the bonding of the benefit agent should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo hydrolysis in the environment of the treatment process for the duration of that process. For example, in laundry cleaning applications, the material should be sufficiently stable so that the bond between the benefit and deposition enhancing part does not undergo hydrolysis in ths wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the benefit agent has been deposited onto the fabric.<br>
Preferably, the bond between the benefit agent and the deposition enhancing part is such that the decay rate constant (kd) of the material in an aqueous solution at 0.01 wt% of the material together with 0.1 wt% of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 40°C at a pH of 10.5 is such that kd
The material of the present invention is water-soluble or water-dispersible in nature and comprises a deposition aid having a polymeric backbone and a benefit agent attached to the deposition aid by a hydrolytically stable bond.<br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
9<br><br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
10<br><br>
Deposition Enhancing Part<br>
The deposition enhancing part has a polymeric backbone and is attached to the benefit agent group by means of a hydrolytically stable bond and is that part of the material which undergoes ester hydrolysis during treatment of a substrate which does not involve the hydrolytically stable bond with the benefit aid group. This ester hydrolysis results in an increase of the affinity of the material for the substrate and is referred to further below.<br>
The polymeric backbone is chosen to have an affinity for the substrate onto which it is to be deposited. It is especially preferred that the polymeric backbone is of a similar chemical composition to the substrate onto which it is to be deposited.<br>
For example, if the fabric is ceDulosic in nature, e.g. cotton, the polymeric backbone is preferably cellulose or a cellulose derivative or a another P-l,4-lmked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as raannan and giucomannan.<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
11<br><br>
Other polymeric backbones suitable as according to the present invention include those described in Hydrocolloid Applications, A. Nussinswitch, Blackie 1997,<br>
Hydrolysis, of substituent ester-linked groups is optionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst.<br>
By ester linkage is meant that the hydrogen of an -OH group has been replaced by a substituent such as R"-CO-, R"S02- etc to form a carboxylic acid ester, sulpbonic acid ester (as appropriate) etc together with the remnant oxygen attached to the saccharide ring. In some cases, title group R may for example contain a heteroatom eg. as an<br><br><br><br>
12<br><br>
-NH- group attached to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage. However, the term ester linkage is still to be construed as encompassing these structures.<br>
Tbe average degree of substitution of these pendant groups which undergo the chemical charge is preferably from 0.1 to 3 (e.g. from 0.3 to 3), more preferably from 0.1 to 1 (e.g. from 0.3 to 1).<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are therefore not in themselves counted in the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups. The pendant groups can be bonded chemically or by other bonding mechanism, to these hydroxyl groups by any means described hereinbelow. The "average degree of substitution" means the average number of pendant groups per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear backbone or are themselves, pendant side groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
13<br><br>
Preferred materials of the invention are cellulosic polymers of formula (I)&gt;<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected benefit agent groups and at least one or more R groups are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
14<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as already mentioned, in formula (I), some of the R groups may optionally have one or more structures, for example as hereinbefore described. For example, one or more R groups may simply be hydrogen or an alky! group.<br>
Preferred groups which undergo the ester hydrolysis may for example be independently selected from one or more of acetate, propanoate, trifluroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-1 -oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate cinnamate formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate, gluconate, methanesulphonate, toluene sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, maionic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, aspartic, glutamic, and malic acids.<br>
Particularly preferred such groups arc the monoacetate, hemisuccinate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate. The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote thoss acetates with the degree of substitution of ! or less on a cellulose or other £-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30°C and in any case below 50°C. When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160). Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate. Glycollic and lactic ester are most common.<br>
15<br><br>
methanesulphonate, toluene, sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, aspartic, glutamic, and malic acids.<br>
Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate, hemisuccinate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxyjpropanoate. The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of 1 or less on a cellulose or other 15-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30°C and in any case below 50°C. When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160). Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate. Glycollic and lactic ester are most common.<br>
Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose chloracetate (GB-A-320 842) by treating 100 parts with 32 parts of NaOH in alcohol added in small portions.<br>
An alternative method of preparing cellulose esters consists in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher ionisation constant (FR-A-702 116). The ester is heated at about 100° with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester. By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate. A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also. As an example cellulose acetate (10 g.) in dioxan (75 ml.) containing oxalic acid (10 g.) is heated at 100° for 2 hours under reflux.<br>
Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, e.g. the acetate, is dissolved in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid (1.82 x 10"). With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used.  If a<br>

ceilulose chain or chains, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility. In the treatment liquor, the ester groups are hydrolysed, causing the cellulose derivative to increase its affinity for the substrate, e.g. the fabric.<br>
In the case when solubilising groups are attached to the polymeric backbone, this is typically via covalent bonding and, may be pendant upon the backbone or incorporated therein. The type of solubilising group may alter according to where the group is positioned with respect to the backbone.<br>
The molecular weight of the deposition enhancing part may typically be in the range of 1,000 to 2,000,000, for example 10,000 to 1,500,000.<br>
Benefit Agent Groups<br>
The benefit agent group may be, in particular, one which imparts a desirable property to a fabric, household surface, dish, or cutlery surface, skin, hair, teeth or nail substrate, especially to a fabric substrate. In practice, a material according to the present uivention may comprise two or more benefit agent groups on the same molecule, either of the same kind or of different kinds.<br>
For hydrophobic benefit agents groups, the deposition enhancing part should be sufficiently soluble to either take the benefit agent group into solution so producing a water-soluble material, or to make the material water dispersible. For the colloidal benefit agents it is preferred that the deposition aid promotes the dispersal of the material.<br>
The material of the present invention must comprise at least one deposition enhancing moiety and at least one benefit agent moiety. However, dependent upon the nature of each moiety, the weight ratio of deposition aid moiety to benefit agent moiety is<br>
17<br><br>
to be deposited. The benefit agent group may be, in particular, one which imparts a desirable property to a fabric, household surface, dish or cutlery surface, skin, hair, teeth or nail substrate, especially to a fabric substrate. In practice, a material according to the present invention may comprise two or more benefit agent groups on the same molecule, either of the same kind or of different kinds.<br>
For hydrophobic benefit agents groups, the deposition enhancing part should be sufficiently soluble to either take the benefit agent group into solution so producing a water-soluble material, or to make the material water dispersible. For the colloidal benefit agents it is preferred that the deposition aid promotes the dispersal of the material.<br>
The material of the present invention must comprise at least one deposition enhancing moiety and at least one benefit agent moiety. However, dependent upon the nature of each moiety, the weight ratio of deposition aid moiety to benefit agent moiety is preferably from 100:1 to 1:10,000, more preferably from 10:1 to 1:5,000 and most preferably from 5:1 to 1:500.<br>
According to the benefit agent type(s), the material of the present invention may, for example be incorporated in liquid or solid fabric treatment compositions, laundry (wash) compositions, household cleaning compositions, hand and machine dishwashing compositions, or personal care compositions.<br>
For fabrics substrates, for example in laundry applications, examples of suitable fabric care benefit agents include silicones, fabric softening clays, or L-beta phase surfactants.<br>
It is especially preferred if the benefit agent gives a perceivable benefit to a fabric.<br>
The present invention is of particular use when the composition is used in laundering fabrics and in this context a benefit agent can be defined as any agent which affects the<br>
18<br><br>
feel, appearance, or the perception of a fabric. For this application, preferred benefit agent groups may be selected from the following:-<br>
(a)	fabric softening and/or conditioning agents;<br>
(b)	lubricants for inhibition of fibre damage and/or for colour care and/or for crease reduction and/or for ease of ironing;<br>
(c)	UV absorbers such as fluoresces and photofading inhibitors, for example sunscreens/UV inhibitors and/or anti-oxidants;<br>
(d)	fungicides and/or insect repellents; and<br>
(e)	perfumes.<br>
Suitable fabric softening and/or conditioning agent groups are preferably chosen from those of the cationic detergent active type, clays and silicones. Those of the cationic detergent active type are preferably selected from quaternary ammonium cationic molecules, for example those having a solubility in water at pH 2.5 and 20 C of less than l0g/1.<br>
It is preferred for the ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds to contain two or more ester groups. In both monoester and the diester quaternary ammonium compounds it is preferred if the ester group(s) is a linking group between the nitrogen atom and an alkyl group. The ester groups(s) are preferably attached to the nitrogen atom via another hydrocarbyl group.<br>
As used herein the term "ester group", when used in the context of a group in the quaternary ammonium material, includes an ester group which is a linking group in the molecule.<br>
Typical are quaternary ammonium compounds containing at least one ester group, preferably two, wherein at least one higher molecular weight group containing at least one ester group and two or three lower molecular weight groups are linked to a<br>
19<br><br>
common nitrogen atom to produce a cation and wherein the electrically balancing anion is a halide, acetate or lower alkosulphate ion, such as chloride or methosulphate. The higher molecular weight substituent on the nitrogen is preferably a higher alkyl group, containing 12 to 28, preferably 12 to 22, e.g. 12 to 20 carbon atoms, such as coco-alkyl, tallowalkyl, hydrogenated tallowalkyl or substituted higher alkyl, and the lower molecular weight substituents are preferably lower alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl or ethyl, or substituted lower alkyl. One or more of the said lower molecular weight substituents may include an aryl moiety or may be replaced by,an aryl, such as benzyl, phenyl or other suitable substituents.<br>
More preferably, the quaternary ammonium material comprises a compound having two long chain alkyl or alkenyl chains with an average chain length equal to or greater than C14.

Other substituents<br>
As well as the benefit agent groups and any pendant groups which undergo a chemical change to enhance deposition, pendant groups of other types may optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not confer a benefit and which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance substrate affinity. Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the material (e.g. groups which are, or contain one or more free carboxyiic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy- and/or (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
The other pendant groups preferably comprise from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 10% of the total number of pendant groups.

Synthetic Routes<br>
There are basically two general methods for preparing a water-soluble or water dispersable material of the class comprising a deposition aid including or having attached thereto, group(s).which undergo the chemical change.<br>
Method 1<br>
First the deposition enhancement part is synthesised; and<br>
then the benefit agent(s) is/are grafted onto the backbone of the deposition enhancement<br>
part.<br>
26<br><br>
Method 2<br>
First the benefit agent is grafted onto the polymeric backbone of a precursor of the<br>
deposition enhancing part; and<br>
then the precursor is converted into the desired deposition enhancing part.<br>
For Methods 1 and 2 the general method for preparing the deposition enhancing part may be achieved by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(a)	polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example, enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda, &amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, 99, 179-184 or oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g. per H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1432-1434.;<br>
(b)	derivatisation of a polymeric backbone (either naturally occurring, especially polysaccharides, especially beta-l,4-linked polysaccharides, especially cellulose, mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan; or synthetic polymers) up to the required degree of substitution with functional groups which improve the solubility of the polymer for deposition, using a reagent (especially acid halides, especially carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acids, carbonates) in a solvent which either dissolves the backbone, swells the backbone, or does not swell the backbone but dissolves or swells the product).<br><br>
(c)	hydrolysis of polymer derivatives (especially esters) down to the required degree of substitution; or<br>
(d)	a combination of any two or more of routes (a)-(c).<br>
Some materials which are suitable as the deposition-enhancing part may be commercially available.<br>
27<br><br>
The degree and pattern of substitution from routes (a) or (c) may be subsequently altered by partial removal of functional groups by hydrolysis or solvolysis or other cleavage. The relative proportions of reactants and reaction conditions may also be used to control the degree of substitution. In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be reduced before, during, or after the derivatisation with functional groups. The degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be increased by further polymerisation or by cross linking agents before, during, or after the derivatisation step.<br>
For Methods 1 and 2 the general method for grafting the benefit agent onto the deposition enhancement part can be effected either:-<br>
(i)       by physical attraction between the delivery aid and the benefit agent, especially the use of a block copolymer where one block has a physical affinity for the benefit agent and the other block can undergo a chemical change during treatment which increases its affinity for the target substrate; or<br>
(ii)      by grafting the benefit agent onto the polymeric backbone of the delivery aid using a bond which is relatively hydrolytically stable. For example, one could use an ester bond which is more stable than the one intended to undergo the chemical change but which is not be completely stable. For example a conjugated or aromatic ester. Such grafting can be accomplished by reacting the polymeric backbone or already-pre-modified polymeric backbone (especially cellulose esters, especially cellulose acetates) with a benefit-agent reagent (especially acid halides, especially carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acids, isocyanates, triazine derivatives, amines, hydrazines) in a solvent which dissolves the backbone or delivery aid, swells the backbone or delivery aid, or does not swell the backbone or delivery enhancing part (depending on whether grafting the benefit agent first or last) but dissolves or swells the product.<br>
28<br><br>
For the grafting, typically, radiation methods may be used, for example:-<br>
1. Grafting bv mutual irradiation ( The direct radiation grafting of the benefit group onto the polymer backbone).<br>
The mutual irradiation method is the simplest radiation-chemical method for producing graft copolymers. The procedure involves the irradiation of a polymeric substrate in the presence of a benefit group-containing monomer solution, preferably in the absence of oxygen at around ambient temperature for a given time and irradiation dose . It is known that most radiation-initiated polymerization proceeds by free radical mechanisms , and that it is initiated by the free radicals arising from the radiolysis of the either polymer or monomer , although the mutual irradiation is the most efficient method of achieve grafting.<br>
2. Grafting on to radiation - peroxided polymer backbone<br>
In this method , the polymeric samples of (typically, a cellulosic) polymer backbone are first irradiated, typically in the presence of air or pure oxygen atmosphere ataround ambient temperature in the absence any monomer or solvent to produce peroxide or hydroperoxides linkages by gamma irradiation. Subsequently, the graft copolymerization is initiated by the free radicals produced from the thermal decomposition of peroxide or hydroperoxides linkages under heating with a benefit agent monomer in the appropriate solvent.<br>
Two different situations arise, depending on whether peroxides or hydroperoxides are formed in the irradiated polymer. Either, the peroxidation leads to peroxidized polymer or else it leads to hydroperoxides.<br>
29<br><br>
Grafting may also be effected by means of chemical grafting, for example using cerie ions (A. Habeish et al, J. Appl. Polym.Sci. 1971, ]_5, 11-24) or using other conventional radical initiators such as potassium persulphate, e.g. per R.K. Samal, et al J. Polym. Mater. 1987,4(3), 165-172.<br>
There are also two general methods for preparing that class water-soluble or water dispersible material comprising a deposition aid having a polymeric backbone and a benefit agent grafted onto the backbone where the benefit agent includes or has attached thereto, group(s) which undergo the chemical change.<br>
Method 3<br>
First the deposition enhancement part is synthesised, or obtained commercially; and then the benefit agent(s) is/are grafted onto the backbone of the deposition enhancement part; and then the group(s) which undergo the chemical change are attached to the benefit agent.<br>
Method 4<br>
First the groups which undergo the chemical change are attached to the benefit agent. The resulting material is. then grafted onto the polymeric backbone of the deposition enhancing part.<br>
For Methods 3 and 4 the general method for preparing the deposition enhancing part if not commercially available may be achieved by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(a)       polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example, enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda, &amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, 99, 179-184 or<br>
30<br><br>
oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g. per H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1432-1434;<br>
(b)	derivatisation, hydrolysis, solvolysis, or other modification of a polymeric backbone which is either synthetic, or naturally occurring: especially polysaccharides, especially beta-l,4-linked polysaccharides, especially cellulose, mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan.<br>
(c)	a combination of (a) and (b).<br>
Some materials which are suitable as the deposition-enhancing part may be commercially available.<br>
In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the backbone form (a), (b) or (c), or of a commercially available material, may be reduced or increased before, during, between, or after any of the steps (a), (b) or (c). The degree of polymerisation may be increased by further polymerisation or by cross linking agents.<br>
For Methods 3 and 4 the general method for grafting the benefit agent (with group(s) attached in Method 4) onto the deposition enhancement part can be effected either: -<br>
by physical attraction between the delivery aid and the benefit agent, especially the use of a block copolymer where one block has a physical affinity for the benefit agent and the other block is the deposition aid; or<br>
by grafting the benefit agent onto the polymeric backbone of the delivery aid using a bond which is relatively hydrolytically stable. For example, one could use an ester bond which is more stable than the one intended to undergo the chemical change but which is not completely stable. For example a conjugated or aromatic ester. Such grafting can be accomplished by reacting the polymeric backbone with a benefit-agent<br><br><br><br>
reagent (especially acid halides, especially carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acids, isocyanates, triazine derivatives, amines, hydrazines) in a solvent which dissolves the backbone or delivery aid, swells the backbone or delivery aid, or does not swell the backbone or delivery enhancing part (depending on whether grafting the benefit agent first or last) but dissolves or swells the product.<br>
For the grafting, typically, radiation methods may be used, as described above for Methods 1 and 2.<br>

The compositions according to the invention may also contain one.or more enzyme(s). Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions. Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are, catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available and can be used in the instant invention. Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are the subtilins which are obtained from particular strains of B. Subtilis B. licheniformis. such as the commercially available subtilisins Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Gist Brocades N. V., Delft, Holland, and Alcalase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Novo Industri A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain of Bacillus having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novo Industri A/S under the registered trade-names Esperase (Trade Mark) and Savinase (Trade-Mark). The preparation of these and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1 243 785, Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark obtainable from Showa-Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali-Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of U.S.A.).<br>
39<br><br>
Detereency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%. However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing. Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%. However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Powder flow may be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or fatty acid soap), a sugar, an acrylate or acrylate/maleate copolymer, or sodium silicate. One preferred powder structurant is fatty acid soap, suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%.<br>
Other materials that may be present in detergent compositions of the invention include sodium silicate; antiredeposition agents such as cellulosic polymers; soil release polymers; inorganic salts such as sodium sulphate; lather control agents or lather boosters as appropriate; proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes; dyes; coloured speckles; perfumes; foam controllers; fluorescers and decoupling polymers. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. However, many of these ingredients will be better delivered as benefit agent groups in materials according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry. The skilled detergent formulator<br>
40<br><br>
will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions of the invention preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/1, more preferably at least 500 g/1. Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities^of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densification of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
Substrate<br>
The substrate may be any substrate onto which it is desirable to deposit benefit agents and which is subjected to treatment such as a washing or rinsing process/<br>
In particular, the substrate may be fabric or of a personal nature such as hair, skin, teeth or nails, or of a domestic nature such as dishes, ceramics, metal, plastics or upholstery.<br>
It has been found that particular good results are achieved when using a natural fabric substrate such as cotton, or fabric blends containing cotton.<br>
41<br><br>
Treatment<br>
The treatment of the substrate with the material of the invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the substrate.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or rinse cycle of a washing machine and involves contacting the substrate with an aqueous medium comprising the material of the invention. Alternatively for personal care applications the treatment could be achieved, for example, by personal washing, bathing or showering.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples:-<br>
Example 1 :   Preparation of cellulose acetate 4-methoxycinnamate<br>
In the example, the delivery enhancing part is cellulose monoacetate. When the acetate groups hydrolyse off during the wash the affinity of the cellulose backbone for the cotton surface will increase. 4-methoxycinnamate is the benefit agent. It is a UV absorber which reduces photofading of dyes on fabric. The ester bond between the cellulose and the 4-methoxy cinnamate is relatively hydrolytically stable because of the conjugated unsaturation.<br>
A mixture of 123 mg 4-methoxycinnamoyl chloride, 100 mg of N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine, 1 ml of pyridine, and a solution of 2.0 g of water-soluble cellulose acetate (DS -0.5) in 40 ml of l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent, were stirred together at 50°C for 3 hours. Most of the solvent was removed under vacuum to leave a very viscous solution. When this solution was poured into water a clear solution was obtained. This experiment demonstrates how a normally water-insoluble benefit agent<br>
42<br><br>
can be dissolved in water. It also demonstrates the grafting of the benefit agent onto the synthesised delivery aid (cellulose acetate).<br>
The aqueous solution was poured into an excess of acetone to precipitate the polymer. The precipitated polymer was filtered off and dried.<br>
Example 2 :   Preparation of cellulose 2-(2-hydroxv-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate 4-methoxycinnamate<br>
Cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate is the delivery enhancing part. When the 2-(2-hydroxy-1 -oxopropoxy)propanoate groups hydrolyse-off during the wash the affinity of the cellulose backbone for the cotton surface will increase. 4-methoxycinnamate is a benefit agent, as in Example 1.<br>
A mixture of 130 mg 4-methoxycinnamoyl chloride and 29.7 g of cellulose solution (obtained by dissolving 14 g of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PHI 05) swollen with 14 g of N,.N-dimethylacetamide into a mixture of 200 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide and 16.8 g of lithium chloride) was treated with 1.5 ml of triethyl amine and stirred at 75°C for 1.5 hours.<br>
Then (following DE 3,322,118 for preparation of cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propanoate) 2.33 g lactide (3,6-dimethyl-l,4-dioxane-2,5-dione) was added to the mixture and stirred at 75°C for 1.5 hours.<br>
Cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate 4-methoxycinnamate was isolated by pipetting the reaction mixture into 300 ml of methanol. The product gel was washed with a further two batches of 300 ml of methanol.<br>
43<br><br>
The cellulose 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate was dried under vacuum at room temperature.<br>
Example 3 : Preparation of cellulose acetate grafted with methvlmethacrylate (MIMA) bv mutual irradiation<br>
In this Example, the benefit agent is MAA, which is a crease-resist agent.<br>
Cellulose acetate (CA) was immersed in a mixture which contains, MAA , water and a single additional liquid at room temperature for 24 hr; subsequently the reaction mixture was flushed with oxygen-free nitrogen for 20 minutes , then the reaction bottle was tightly sealed , the reaction were carried out at a 9000 Ci 60Co y - source at room temperature. After a given irradiation dose (the dose rate was determined by Fricke dosimetry), the solutions were filtered, the copolymeric products of MAA grafting on CA were immersed in an excess of methanol for at least 24 hr., then filtered to remove PMAA and unreaction monomer MAA.<br>
Subsequently the grafted C A was washed with large amount of methanol again , to remove homopolymer (PMAA ) and unreacted monomer (MAA ) thoroughly. After this step the methanol was evaporated off in fume cupboard and the grafted CA was dried to constant mass at 60°C in an oven and finally dried in a vacuum at 45°C. Thereafter, the combined methanolic solutions of PMAA and MAA were evaporated in a fume cupboard. The residue was dried in an oven at 80°C. Subsequently the dry mixture of PMAA and MAA was swollen and thoroughly washed with acetone to remove unreacted monomer. The pure PMAA was isolated by evaporation in a fume<br>
44<br><br>
cupboard , and dried to constant weight in an 80°C oven and final drying in a vacuum oven at 45°C. The amount of grafted monomer was taken as the increase in weight after solvent-extraction of homopolymer and drying . The percent grafting is defined as the ratio of the increase in weight to the initial polymeric ( CA ) weight as follows:<br>
Grafting ( GD )%= 100 x ( WF - Wi)/Wi<br>
where WF = Final grafting copolymeric weight; Wi =   Initial polymeric weight;<br>
The percent of homopolymer is defined as the ratio of the homopolymer weight to the initial monomer weight as follows:<br>
% Homopolymer ( HP ) = 100 x ( Wt of PMAA / Wt. of initial MAA).<br>
The total conversion and grafting efficiency were calculated as follows<br>
% Total conversition ( TC ) = 100 x [ Wt. of PMAA + ( WF - WI ) ] / (Wt. of initial MAA).<br>
where WF = Final grafting polymeric weight; Wi = Initial polymeric weight<br>
% Grafting efficiency ( GE ) = 100 x [ Wt. of PMAA in grafting / Total Wt. of PMAA formed]<br>
45<br><br>
Example 4 : Preparation of Graft cellulose acetate by polymer peroxide or hydroperoxides initiated methods<br>
In an alternative method using pure CA, the latter was directly exposed in y - source under air atmosphere at room temperature. Pre-irradiated CA was swollen in MAA and in a single or mixture of liquids. Then, graft copolymerization was carried out in water bath at 60°C under pure nitrogen atmosphere for 6 hr.<br>
After reaction, the mixtures were filtered and the copolymeric products of MAA grafted onto the CAA were immersed in an excess of methanol at least 24 hr. , then filtered again. Subsequently, the grafted CA was washed with a large amount of methanol again to remove homopolymer (PMAA ) and unreacted monomer (MAA) thoroughly. Afterwards, they were dried to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 45°C. Thereafter , the liquid which was obtained after removing PMAA and MAA , was collected and evaporated in a fume cupboard and dried at 80°C in an oven. Subsequently, the mixture of PMAA and MAA was swollen and thoroughly washed with acetone to remove unreacted monomer and the pure PMAA was dried to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 45°C. The grafting rate was calculated.<br>
By analysis, in each of Examples 1 -4, the average degree of substituion of hydrolvsable groups was found to be between 0.1 to3.<br>
Examples 5-16 are formulation Examples. In each case, the "Polymer" specified is the material of Example 1.<br>
