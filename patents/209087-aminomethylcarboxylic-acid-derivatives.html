				<td>The invention relates to^jnqmettiyjcarboxylic acid derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, as well as to the use of these aminomethyl-carboxylic acid derivatives in therapy.<br>
The simplest a-amino acid glycine, or aminomethylcarfaoxylic acid, has a number of important roles in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Along with C-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it is a major post-synaptic inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem, acting through ligand gated ion channels. Interaction of glycine with these receptors can be antagonized by the alkaloid strychnine. These receptors are therefore referred to as "strychnine sensitive" glycine receptors. Glyclnergic neurotransmission is important in the processing and control of visual, auditory ana motor signalling. Glycine is also an obligatory co-agonist along with glutamate at the W-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Glycine therefore functions in excitatory transmission by modulating the actions of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. In addition the amino acid plays a role in the metabolism of peptides and proteins, including the exchange of one-carbon units.<br>
Control of the availability of glycine for any of the above processes will potentially influence their function and provide means of treating a number of diseases and conditions. Apart from metabolism, one of the major pnDCesses controlling the concentrations of free glycine in the proximity of strychnine-sensitive and strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors is the functioning of selective high affinity glycine transporters. These proteins can actively limit the spread of glycine beyond the immediate environs of receptors, thus maintaining both spatial and temporal fidelity of receptor activation. Rapid sequestering of transmitter into neuronal or glial cells via the transporter will also conserve glycine for future release.<br>
-<br>
Glycine transporters have been cloned to reveal two major classes, GlyT-1 and G!yT-2. GlyT-1 is expressed throughout the brain with higher mRNA levels being detected in caudal areas and cellular localisation being predominantly glial.<br><br>
Three isoforms of GlyT-1,1 a, 1 b and 1 c, arising from differential splicing and exon<br>
usage have been identified by Kim at al. (Molecular Pharm. 1994,45, 608-617). GlyT-2 distribution, as indicated by immunochemistry studies, corresponds<br>
closely to that of inhibitory "strychnine sensitive" glycine receptors, particulariy in the<br>
spinal cord.<br>
By regulating the synaptic levels of glycine, the glycine transporters GlyT-1<br>
and GlyT-2 are expected to selectively Influence the activity at NMDA receptors and<br>
at strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, respectively.<br>
Compounds which alter the functional activity of glycine transporters may<br>
therefore result in changes in tissue glycine levels which can be usefljl <br> the treatment of a number of disease states. Such disease states include those associated with decreased or exaggerated function of NMDA receptors, namely psychosis, depression, dementia and other forms of impaired cognition, such as attention deficit disorders. NMDA receptors have further been implicated in conditions arising from neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration such as, for example, stroke (head trauma), Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinson"s disease and Huntington"s disease. Enhanced inhibitory glycinergic transmission resulting from inhibition of GlyT-2 or GiyT-1 activity may be useful in the treatment of muscle hyperactivity associated with spasticity, myoclonus and epilepsy. Compounds elevating spina! glycine may also possess analgesic properties.<br>
Aminomethyicarboxylic acid derivatives, wherein the amino group carries an ethyl or a propyl-group which is substituted by two or three aryl and/or aryloxy groups, are disclosed in WO 97/45115 (TROPHIX PHARM. INC.) as compounds useful in the treatment of the neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders discussed above. Stnjcturatly related aminomethyicarboxylic acid derivatives, wherein the aminogroup is part of a cyclic amine which is substituted at a single position with (a substituent containing) two aryl or cycloalkyi groups, are disclosed in WO 97/45423 (TROPHIX PHARM. INC.) as having similar activity. There exists a need for additional compounds suitable for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, especially for compounds having a selective phamnacological profile.<br><br>

Compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (II) wherein X, Y, Z, Rj and R4 have the previously defined meanings, with a compound offormulaL-CHR,R3, wherein R, is COOR^orCONRgRg, R^-Rgand R3 are as defined previously, and L is a suitable leaving group, such as for example halogen, preferably bromo. The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such asW.W-dimethylformamide and an acid scavenger such as potassium or cesium carbonate at elevated temperatures, for example at 80 "C. Compounds of formula (I) wherein R, is carboxylate COpR^ wherein R^ is hydrogen, may be conveniently prepared by hydrolysis of the con-esponding esters GOOR7, wherein R^ is (C,^)alkyl, (C^tajaryl or arylalkyi, using standard conditions for ester hydrolysis, for example, by heating the aforementioned esters in a mixture of<br><br>
dijueuus potassium nyaroxiae m ethanoi at reflux temperature, or by catalytic hydrogenation of. for example, benzyl esters. Compounds of formula (I), wherein R is carboxamide CONReRg, wherein Rg and R^ are (C,^)alkyl may also be prepared by reaction of the aforementioned carboxylic acids with amines HNRgRg using standard conditions for amide fomiation, for example, by reaction of the cariaoxyjic acid with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcari3odiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in the presence of a terttary amine in W./V-dimethylformamide. Alternatively they can be made by, for example by the reaction of the aforementioned cartjoxylic acids with thionyl chloride or oxalylchloride in methylene chloride containing a catalytic amount of W,A/-dimethylformamide followed by reaction of the resulting acid chlorides with amines HNRgRg in the presence of a tertiary amine acid scavenger in methylene chloride at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) wherein the phenyl group and the CHR^-NHR^ group occur in the trans configuration can be prepared from the appropriately substituted 1-phenyl-1.2.3,4-tetrahydnD-2-naphthoic acids by methods we!l known in the art. The aforementioned 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acids, prepared by the method described in J.C/jem.Soc.,1936. 596-599, can, for example, can react to form the corresponding acyl halides or anhydrides using standard methods. These in tum, upon reaction with amines R2NH2 followed by reduction of the resulting amides provide the desired compounds (II). For the reduction of the amides, sodium borohydride in the presence of certain catalysts, borane^ or lithium aluminium hydride in a non-protic solvent such as diethyl-ether or tetrahydrofiiran can be used.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) wherein the phenyl group and the CHR^-NHR; group occur in the cis configuration are obtained by reaction of compounds of fomnula (III) with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium on carbon catalyst in ethanoi containing aqueous hydrochloric acid. Typically the reaction occurs in the temp¬erature range 0-50 "C and at a pressure ranging from 1 to 4 atmospheres. Alternatively, debenzylation can be achieved by treating compounds of formula (111) with (l-chloroethyl)chloroformate in dichloromethane at reflux temperature followed by heating in the presence of methyl alcohol.<br><br><br>

The reaction is typically canied out in the presence of an apolar, aprotic solvent such as for example diethyl ether at a temperature in the range-10 to+20 "C.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (V) are obtained by reaction of compounds of formula (VI) with the appropriate aldehyde HCO-R4 and a compound of fomiufa NHRJCHJCBHS in ethanol containing aqueous hydrochloric acid at reflux.<br><br>
fomiula VI Compounds of formula (VI) are commercially available or are prepared by methods described in the literature. Such methods are, for example, descibed in Compre¬hensive Organic Transfomiations (by Richard C. Larock, 1989, VCH). For example, the compound of fomiula VI wherein X is 6-fluoro and Z is methylene may be prepared by cydlsation of 4-(3-fluorophenyl)butyric acid using an acid catalyst such as polyph05t)horic acid. The latter compound can be conveniently prepared by reaction of 3-fluorobenzaldehyde with methyl acrylate in the presence of potassium cyanide In A/,N-dimethylformamide, at 45 "C followed by reduction of the resultant oxobutanoate using hydrazine hydrate and potassium hydroxide in ethylene glycol at reflux temperature. Similariy the compound wherein X is 6-thiomethyl and Z is methylene can be prepared from the commercially available 6-methoxy analogue by the method described m.Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1984,22, 130. Compounds wherein X is (C,^)alkyloxy, wherein (C,^)alkyloxy has the meaning as previously defined, can be prepared from the 6-methoxy analogue by treatment with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid followed by reaction of the resulting phenol with an appropriate alkyl halide, typically an alkyl bromide or alky! iodide in dimethylfomi-amide in the presence of a suitable acid scavenger such as potassium or cesium carbonate at elevated temperatures. Alternatively, the required ethers can be prepared by reaction of the phenol with an alcohol according to Mitsunobo"s conditions which are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds wherein X is (CB.,2)aryloxy, wherein (C6.i2)afyloxy is defined as above, can be prepared from the aforementioned phenol using the methods described in<br><br>
Chem. Pharm.Bull. 1978,2&amp;, 2475-2482. Said phenol derivatives can likewise be converted with trifiic anhydride to the corresponding triflate derivative, the trifete group of which can be converted, using methods known to the skilled person, to an amino group.<br>
Compounds of fonnula (VI) wherein Z is oxygen can be prepared as described in J.Chem.Soc, 1954,4299-4303; those wherein Z is S can be synthesised as indicated in J.Am.Chem.Soc., 1954, 76. 5065-5069.<br>
The skilled person will be aware of numerous general synthetic methods that aJlow the conversion of a certain group X in a compound according to one of the Formulas l-VI to another group X according to the definition of X. For example, a compound according to formula III,-wherein X is a 6-bromo group, can be sequentially converted to a methoxycarbonyl group {X=COORe, wherein R^ is methyl) and a cyano group.<br>
The compounds of this invention possess at least two chiral cartmn atoms, and can therefore be obtained as pure stereoisomers, or as a mixture of stereoisomers. Methods for asymmetric synthesis whereby the pure stereoisomers are obtained are well known In the art, e.g. synthesis with chiral induction, enantioseiective enzymatic ester hydrolysis, crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, separation of stereoisomers or enantiomers using chromatography on chiral media, or on straight phase or reversed phase chromat¬ography media. Such methods are for example described in Chiralityin Industry (edited by A. N. Collins, G. N. Sheldrake and J. Crosby,-1992; John Wiley).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I may be obtained by treating the free base of the compounds accorciing to formula I with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, preferably hydra-chloric acid, or with an organic acid such as for example ascorbic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, fumaric acid, glycolic acid, suc¬cinic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, methanesulphonic acid and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of fonnuia I wherein R, is COOR7 and Ry is hydrogen, may be obtained by treating the add or zwitterionic form of<br><br>
those compounds with a,n organic base or a mineral base, like sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered for humans in a dosage of 0.001-50 mg per kg body weight, preferably in a dosage of 0.01-20 mg per kg body weight.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for use according to the invention comprise an aminomethylcarboxylic acid derivative having fonmuia I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents. The term "acceptable" means being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. The compositions can be prepared in accordance with standard techniques such as for example are described in the standard reference, Gennaro etal.. Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed.. Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Phamnaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture). Compositions Include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, intranasal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>

The excess hydrazine hydrate was distilled off until the temperature at the still-head reached 160 °C. The reaction mixture was then cooled, diluted with water (400 cm^) and the resultant aqueous mass was washed with diethyl ether (2 x 150 cm"} and then acidified with hydrtjchloric acid (5 l\/l, 150 cm"). The acidic mixture was then extracted with diethyl ""  ether (2 x 150 cm") and the combined extracts were dried (NaaSO^) and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide the title compound (15.51 g)asa dark oil. Step C: 6-FluorD-3.4-dihvdro-2H-naphthalene-1-one<br>
A mixture of 4-(3-fluorophenyl)butanoic acid (10 g) and polyphosphoric acid (100 g) was heated to 70 °C with stirring for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and water was carefully added (400 cm"). The aqueous mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 75 cm") and the combined extracts were washed sequentially with aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (1 M, 75 cm"), water (75 cm") and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (75 cm"). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2S04), and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The crude product (6.58 g) was purified by column chromatography [silica, eluting with petroleum ether (b. p. 40-60 °C)-ethyl acetate (20:1)] to afford the title compound<br>
(6.36 g).<br>
Step D: 2./A;.Benzylmethytaminn\methvl-fi-fluQrQ-3.4-dihvdro-2H-naDhthalene-1 -one<br>
