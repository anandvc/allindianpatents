TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVEMTTCN<br>
The present invention relaces generally to tihe feld of networked computer systems and more specifically to client server communications applications allowing failure detection and recovery.,<br>
In an effort to become more efficient, provide quality service and save money, many businesses have decided to migrate their systems to a client server environment: or a hybrid  environment  combining  traditional  mainframe processing while distributing some processes to remote servers,  client server systems are handling an increasing number of processes distributed over  various machines. For example,  Electronic Data Interchange  (EDI) allowe businesses to exchange many kinds of daca with each other electronically.   EDI is typically performed through an electronic network.  An electronic network is typically owned and operated by a third party service provider which contracts with the businesses subscribing to the electronic network,  In a typical arrangement, vendors and purchasers will subscribe to the electronic network. These parties may exchange  electronic  mail  messages  (E-mail),  purchase orders, approvals and inventories as well as a myriad of other information through the network.   Additionally, various levels of processing may occur within the network ao as to automate the business transactions occurring between the vendor and the purchaser.  Traditionally, this processing typically occurs on a mainframe computer owned by the third party service provider,  However, as the number of subscribers increases, the amount of processing load on the mainframe increases,  A mainframe system must<br>
constantly be upgraded and additional processing power must be added at high coat. One attempted solution is to use client/server or distributed computing components either individually or in combination with a mainframe.<br>
Although existing mainframe systems have robust failure detection and recovery capabilities, client/server environments typically suffer from some important drawbacks with respect to failure detection and recovery procedures. For example, a mainframe may send a transaction to a remote server for processing. In such a case, the transaction may encounter a problem (e.g., a program may terminate abnormally or the entire server may fail) . The mainframe will be generally unaware of this problem if it occurs on a remote processor. Although UNIX and other like operating systems for use in a clietn/server environment have some failure reporting, deficiencies such as a lack of control over or accounting for processes may occur. The likelihood of an undetected failure or a lost process may typically rise co an unacceptable level* In an EDI environment, for axampl«, failed transactions may result in late or unshipped goods between a supplier and retailer resulting in millions of dollars of lost ssales. Additionally, even to the extent that client-server based systems do include failure detection and recovery systems, thes« methods and tools cannot be readily incorporated into and cooridnated with an existing mainframe environment.<br>
Accordingly, a need has arisen for a transaction processing system allowing for cost efficient, rapid and reliable data processing in a client/server or in a hybrid mainframe-client/server environment. It is also desirable to provide a system which assures chat few, :f any, transactions will remain unprocessed and undetected at the close of processing operations without compromising cost or<br>
response time with respect to transactions that are processed .<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3,t hree particular embodiments of the transaction processing system 1Q of the present invention are shown. It should be noted that the teachings of the present invention have broad application in and among a variety of processing systems. Although the following description refers primarily to the processing of "batches", it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art chat the present invention may similarly be used in an OLTP environment in a manner readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art based upon the following description. The benefits of this invention are thus also obtained in a system for processing real time, individual transactions such that robustness and failure detection and recovery are provided.<br>
Mainframe 55 may be an IBM or Amdahl mainframe or any other suitableM VS based system. The teachings of the present invention preferably function in an environment wherein, a single m* in frame to uacsd. Mainframe 55 comprises a number c£ process running either concurrently or in serial fashion. While FIG. 1 illustrates some of the more important processes running on mainframe 55, these processes are by no means exclusive and others may, and typically are, also present and running.Inbound processes 35, outbound processes 10, value added programs 50, initiator 25, managers 45, and RUROK process 205 may be C or COBOL computer programs, firmware, software or other technology suitable for data manipulation on a mainframe computer. These processes and programs may comprise specifically designed hardware within mainframe 55 or they may operate on a general purpose processor specifically configured through software and/or firmware to accomplish the desired task. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art based upon the description herein. the system of the present invention may include multiple processes or programs for achieving the same function. These programs and processes, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, operate in parallel. For example, there may be two or more inbound processes 35 running on mainframe 55 concurrently, each processing a portion of the collective data being received.<br>
Remote servers 90, 105 and 115 preferably comprise Sun 1000 processors manufactured by Sun Microsystems. Other remote servers such as International Business Machines' IBM RISC 6000 series, Hewlett-Packard's HP 900 series, or other UNIX based servers may also be used. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, remote servers 90, 105 and 115 run under a UNIX operating system.<br>
Inbound processes; 70, outbound processes 75 value added programs 95, managers 65, and RUOK processes 80, 110 may be C or COBOL computer programs, firmware, software or other technology suitable for data manipulation on a server. These processes and programs may comprise specifically designed hardware within remote servers 90, 105, 115 or they may operate on a general purpose processor specifically configured through software and/or firmware to accomplish the desired task, As will be apparent to one of skill in the art based upon the description herein, the<br>
system of the present invention may include multiple procassee or programs for achieving the same function. These programs and processes, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, operate in parallel. For example, there may be two or more inbound processes 70 running on remote server 90 concurrently, each processing a portion of the collective data being received.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention, middleware 60 may comprise an LU6.2 peer to peer programming language and network connection 63, ISO may be a token ring or an Ethernet network. Other suitable communications protocols may be substituted in order to effect communication between mainframe 55 and remote servers 90, 105, and 115.<br>
in a particular embodiment of the present invention, customer system 5 communicates with mainframe 55. Customer system 5 may comprise a personal computer, a mainframe or minicomputer with attached dumb terminal or PC, or any other device providing input and output capabilities as well aa communication facilities to enable communication with mainframe 55. Customer system 5 communicates asynchronously though COMMERCE:Network™, or synchronously via open Bisync, SNA 3770, or other suitable means. Mainframe 55 recognizes new processes and may, as a result, initiate an inbound process 35 which sends data to one or more value added programs 50. Value added programs 50 comprise one or more value added programs (e.g., carbon copy, change interchange header type, or extract network commands and perform associated functions). Outbound process 40 formats data generated by or routed through value added programs 50 and prepares the data for delivery to another customer or another system user. Inbound process 35 examines incoming transmissions and determines<br>
the type of data received, its target destination and the type of processing which is to be performed upon such data.<br>
For example, inbound process 35 may read customer profile records and determine that the associated data which has been received is an EDI message sent from Company A (purchaser) to Company B (vendor) and requires a carbon copy to be created. Value added programs 50 may generate, for example, a carbon copy of the EDI message and send the updated data either back to inbound process 35, or directly co outbound process 40 or to both inbound process 35 and outbound process 40. Outbound process 40 may determine that the transmission neads to go to a particular mailbox (e.g. SNA or Bisync mailbox), needs to be in records which are a particular block size (e.g., 256, or 400 block records), or requires that records be spanned across blocks. This may be done via a control record within the transmission. In other words, outbound process 40 conditions the data for outbound delivery.<br>
inbound processes 35 and outbound processes 40 are likely to ba among the most CPU intensive processes running on mainframe 55. In the system of the present invention, initiator 25 determines which processes will run on remote server 90 (or 105 or 115). Initiator 25 reads intercept table 30 which describes the type of data and/or transactions which are or arenot acceptable Cor execution on a remote server $0, 105, 115.<br>
TABLE :1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
TABLE 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Tables 1 and 2 illustrate an example of the contencs and makeup of intercept table 30. This particular embodiment is by no means exclusive and is merely exemplary. Other fields may be used, added or deleted while remaining within tne scope of the present invention. The example in Table 1 illustrates a situation in which Customer A'e transactions/batches will never run on a remote server and must always run on mainframe 55. Also, if for example Customer B's transactions/batches are always SNA protocol and 400 or more blocks, taey will only run an mianframe 55 since Customer B uses an SNA protocol. However, if Custoner C's transactions/batches are asynchronous, then it's transactions which are 200 blocks or leas will be selected tor execution on a remote server.<br>
In a particular example, remote servers may only process Bisync and asynchronous communication protocols, while mainframe 55 can process all possible modes of communication, Specifically, communication between mainframe 55 and remote server 90 may be impossible since compregsion algorithms in SNA are incompatible and more complex then those or. Bisync. Referring to Table l, if<br>
Customer A sends a 150 block transmission, it will be processed by mainframe 55. If Customer B sends a 150 block transmission, it will be processed by mainframe 55. Finally, if Customer C sends a 150 block transmission, it win be processed by remote server 90. It should be understood that there may be other reasons (i.e., unique data or programs which have not been converted to UNIX) causing particular data sets, batches or transaction sets to be unsuitable for processing on remote server 90. Thus, i£ it is determined through the use of the intercept cable that a remote srever cannot process d transactino, that transaction is processed on mainframe 55.<br>
In the particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. i, manager 45 on mainframe 55 determines whether remote server 90 can accept more work by communicating with manager 65 on remote server 9C over network connection 63 end middleware 60. Manager 65 on remote server 90 is a duplicate process of manager 45 located on mainframe 55. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, inbound process 35, outbound process 40, and manager 45 are matched to analogous remote server programs. For example, manager 45 communicates with related manager 65 on remote server 90. in a preferred embodiment ot the present invention, there exists an inbound process 70 located on the remote server 90 for every batch sent to remote server 90. As a result, the same number of inbound processes must be initiated and maintained on mainframe 55.<br>
Typically, several transmissions are processed as described above until. 1 several processes based upon value added programs 95 arie running on remote server 90. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, each batch sent to remote server 90 may contain a plurality ot interchanges (e.g., groups of records in a transmission which a sent by the same sender to the same receiver) which<br>
perform a predetermined number of steps. The amount of time these steps should take (or which the whole batch should take) is determined and stored in a table or in a control file. Status table 67, located within the remote server manager 65, stores the steps which have been completed and those which have yet to be completed in byte form. Table 3 illustrates an example of status uable 67. This format ia merely exemplary and for illustraitive purposes only.<br>
TABLE 3<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
At suitable -intervale, RUCK process  is executed so as to copy data from status tables 67 to status table 43<br>
(the latter being contained within manager 45 on mainframe 55) . RUOK process 80 than checks status table 43 and determines if any step or batch has taken (or ie taking) longer than a predetermined amount of time. Thac predetermined time may ba, for example, 45 minutes. If at time 1:30 RUOK process 80 checks the status table, no failure will be indicated because process #2 sub-process #3 has b«en actives for only 30 minutes. See Table 3. However, if at time 2:00 RUOK process 80 checks status table 67, a failure will be indicated because process #2 sub-process 83 has been active for 1 hour. see. Table 3. If so, RUOK process 80 orders the shutdown of remote server 9C. RUOK process 80 notifies manager 45. Finally, manager 45 then reruns all batches currently running on remote serve 30 by checking status table 43 for uncompleted batches. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, manager 45 may be notified before remote server 90 is shut down.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, another embodiment of the transaction processing system 10 of the present invention is shown. Specifically, failure is detected on a first remote server by a process running on a second remote server. At least two remote servers 90, 115 may exist, as well as additional remote servers (such as remote server 105) . Each remote server may contain a manager 65, inbound<br>
processes 70, outbound processes 75, and value added programs 95. A transmission or batch may be selectively allocated to remote servers 90, 105, and 115 by initiator 25 through manager 43, Manager 45 notifies manager 65. Manager 65 determines which server to send batches based on status table 67. For example, manager 65 may use suitable algorithms based upon the individual application to determine how many more tacko each server can process beyond itg existing load (load may be determined by<br>
checking status table 67) . Alternatively, manager 65 may allocate a new batch to the laaat busy remote server.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention, RUOK process 80 runs periodically. RUOK process 80 may communicate, for example, using RPC calls in TCP/IP protocol over a network connection 150, for example, Ethernet, RUOK process 80 requests status table 112 from RUOK process 110. RUOK process HO sends its tables to RUOK process 60 over network connection 150. If RUOK process no fails to respond in a timely manner, RUOK process 80 orders the shutdown of remote server i:.5. RUOK process 80 then notifies manager 45. Finally, manager 45 reruns all batches currently running on remote server 90 by checking status table 43 for uncompleted batches. In an alternative embodiment: of the present invention, manager 45 may be notified before remote server 115 is shut down. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of remote servers 105 each contain one of a plurality of RUOK processes 120 which communicate in the same manner as RUOK process 80 and RUOK process HO. Specifically, each ramote server's manager has a copy of each of the other remote servers' status tables. RUOK processes 80, 110, or 120 may perform a recovery prDceas on any other remote server which fails to respond in a timely manner.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, another embodiment of the transaction processing system 10 of the present invention is shown. specifically, a failure on a remote server is detected by RUOK process running on mainframe 55, Mainframe 55 periodically runs RUROK process 205. RUROK process 205 may commur.icatc, for example, using U calls in SNA protocol over a network connection 63, for example, token ring network or Ethernet. RUROK process 205 requests status table 67 from RUOK process 80. RUOK process 80<br>
sends ite tables to RUROK process 205 over network 63. If RUOK process 80 fails to respond in a timely manner, RUROK process 205 orders the shutdown of remote server 90. RUROK process 205 then notifies manager 45. Manager 45 then reruns all batches currently running on remote server 90 by checking status table 43 for uncompleted batches. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, manager 45 may be notified before remote server 90 is shut down.<br>
Referring now to PIG. 4, a particular embodiment of the method 300 of the present invention is shown. A recovery process may run on demand or on a schedule. Step 315, If requested, the recovery process checks to determine if there is a problem with a server. Step 330. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the recovery process runs on the same server it is checking and checks by determining the progress of a batch or transaction in a status table. In another embodiment of the present invention,, the recovery process runs on a first server and checks a second server by requesting a response. A failure may be indicated by the lack of a response in a predetermined amount of time. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the recovery process runs on a mainframe and checks a server by requesting a response. A failure may be indicated by the lack of a response in a pridetermined amount of time. step 330. If tne check does not report a failure, normal processing continues. Step 340. If, however, a failure is indicated, the recovery process will request the shutdown of the failed server. Step 345, 350. This notification may be from a recovery process to a manager process on the mainframe. Next, the mainframe is notified. Step 355. Finally, the mainframe will restart the uncompleted tasks from the failed server based on the status table. Step 360.<br>
The above description is merely illustrative of the present invention and should not: be considered to limit the scope thereof. Additional modifications, substitutions, alterations and other changes may be made tc the invention without departing from the spirit and sccpe thereof as defined by the appended claims. -<br><br><br><br>
