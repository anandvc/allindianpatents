RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application claims the benefit of an earlier filing date under title 35,<br>
United States Code, Section 120 to the United States patent Application having serial<br>
number 10/313,773 filed on December 6, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of performing motion estimation in a<br>
digital video system . In particular the present invention discloses methods and systems<br>
for specifying variable accuracy inter-picture timing with reduced requirements for<br>
processor intensive division operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Digital based electronic media formats are finally on the cusp of largely<br>
replacing analog electronic media formats. Digital compact discs (CDs) replaced analog<br>
vinyl records long ago. Analog magnetic cassette tapes are becoming increasingly rare.<br>
Second and third generation digital audio systems such as Mini-discs and MP3 (MPEG<br>
Audio - layer 3) are now taking market share from the first generation digital audio<br>
format of compact discs.<br>
The video media formats have been slower to move to digital storage and<br>
digital transmission formats than audio media. The reason for this slower digital<br>
adoption has been largely due to the massive amounts of digital information required to<br>
accurately represent acceptable quality video in digital form and the fast processing<br>
capabilities needed to encode compressed video. The massive amounts of digital<br>
information needed to accurately represent video require very high-capacity digital<br>
storage systems and high-bandwidth transmission systems.<br>
However, video is now rapidly moving to digital storage and transmission<br>
formats. Faster computer processors, high-density storage systems, and new efficient<br>
compression and encoding algorithms have finally made digital video transmission and<br>
storage practical at consumer price points. The DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), a digital<br>
video system, has been one of the fastest selling consumer electronic products in years.<br>
DVDs have been rapidly supplanting Video-Cassette Recorders (VCRs) as the prerecorded<br>
video playback system of choice due to their high video quality, very high audio<br>
quality, convenience, and extra features. The antiquated analog NTSC (National<br>
Television Standards Committee) video transmission system is currently in the process of<br>
being replaced with the digital ATSC (Advanced Television Standards Committee) video<br>
transmission system.<br>
Computer systems have been using various different digital video<br>
encoding formats for a number of years. Specifically, computer systems have employed<br>
different video coder/decoder methods for compressing and encoding or decompressing<br>
and decoding digital video, respectively. A video coder/decoder method, in hardware or<br>
software implementation, is commonly referred to as a "CODEC".<br>
Among the best digital video compression and encoding systems used by<br>
computer systems have been the digital video systems backed by the Motion Pictures<br>
Expert Group commonly known by the acronym MPEG. The three most well known and<br>
highly used digital video formats from MPEG are known simply as MPEG-1, MPEG-2,<br>
and MPEG-4. VideoCDs (VCDs) and early consumer-grade digital video editing systems<br>
use the early MPEG-1 digital video encoding format. Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs) and<br>
the Dish Network brand Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) television broadcast system use<br>
the higher quality MPEG-2 digital video compression and encoding system. The MPEG-<br>
4 encoding system is rapidly being adapted by the latest computer based digital video<br>
encoders and associated digital video players.<br>
The MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 standards compress a series of video frames or<br>
video fields and then encode the compressed frames or fields into a digital bitstream.<br>
When encoding a video frame or field with the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 systems, the video<br>
frame or field is divided into a rectangular grid of pixelblocks. Each pixelblock is<br>
independently compressed and encoded.<br>
When compressing a video frame or field, the MPEG-4 standard may<br>
compress the frame or field into one of three types of compressed frames or fields: Intra-<br>
frames (I-frames), Unidirectional Predicted frames (P-frames), or Bi-Directional<br>
Predicted frames (B-frames). Intra-frames completely independently encode an<br>
independent video frame with no reference to other video frames. P-frames define a<br>
video frame with reference to a single previously displayed video frame. B-frames define<br>
a video frame with reference to both a video frame displayed before the current frame and<br>
a video frame to be displayed after the current frame. Due to their efficient usage of<br>
redundant video information, P-frames and B-frames generally provide the best<br>
compression.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and apparatus for performing motion estimation in a video<br>
codec is disclosed. Specifically, the present invention discloses a system that quickly<br>
calculates estimated motion vectors in a very efficient manner without requiring an<br>
excessive number of division operations..<br>
In one embodiment, a first multiplicand is determined by multiplying a<br>
first display time difference between a first video picture and a second video picture by a<br>
power of two scale value. This step scales up a numerator for a ratio. Next, the system<br>
determines a scaled ratio by dividing that scaled numerator by a second first display time<br>
difference between said second video picture and a third video picture. The scaled ratio<br>
is then stored to be used later for calculating motion vector estimations. By storing the<br>
scaled ratio, all the estimated motion vectors can be calculated quickly with good<br>
precision since the scaled ratio saves significant bits and reducing the scale is performed<br>
by simple shifts thus eliminating the need for time consuming division operations.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A method and system for specifying Variable Accuracy Inter-Picture<br>
Timing in a multimedia compression and encoding system with reduced requirements for<br>
division operations is disclosed. In the following description, for purposes of<br>
explanation, specific nomenclature is set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the<br>
present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific<br>
details are not required in order to practice the present invention. For example, the<br>
present invention has been described with reference to the MPEG multimedia<br>
compression and encoding system. However, the same techniques can easily be applied<br>
to other types of compression and encoding systems.<br>
Multimedia Compression and Encoding Overview<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a high-level block diagram of a typical digital video<br>
encoder 100 as is well known in the art. The digital video encoder 100 receives an<br>
incoming video stream of video frames 105 at the left of the block diagram. The digital<br>
video encoder 100 partitions each video frame into a grid of pixelblocks. The pixelblocks<br>
are individually compressed. Various different sizes of pixelblocks may be used by<br>
different video encoding systems. For example, different pixelblock resolutions include<br>
8x8, 8x4, 16x8, 4x4, etc. Furthermore, pixelblocks are occasionally referred to as<br>
'macroblocks.' This document will use the term pixelblock to refer to any block of pixels<br>
of any size.<br>
A Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) unit 110 processes each<br>
pixelblock in the video frame. The frame may be processed independently (an intra-<br>
frame) or with reference to information from other frames received from the motion<br>
compensation unit (an inter-frame). Next, a Quantizer (Q) unit 120 quantizes the<br>
information from the Discrete Cosine Transformation unit 110. Finally, the quantized<br>
video frame is then encoded with an entropy encoder (H) unit 180 to produce an encoded<br>
bitstream. The entropy encoder (H) unit 180 may use a variable length coding (VLC)<br>
system.<br>
Since an inter-frame encoded video frame is defined with reference to<br>
 other nearby video frames, the digital video encoder 100 needs to create a copy of how<br>
each decoded frame will appear within a digital video decoder such that inter-frames may<br>
be encoded. Thus, the lower portion of the digital video encoder 100 is actually a digital<br>
video decoder system. Specifically, an inverse quantizer (Q-1) unit 130 reverses the<br>
quantization of the video frame information and an inverse Discrete Cosine<br>
Transformation (DCT-1) unit 140 reverses the Discrete Cosine Transformation of the<br>
video frame information. After all the DCT coefficients are reconstructed from inverse<br>
Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT-1) unit 140, the motion compensation unit will use<br>
that information, along with the motion vectors, to reconstruct the encoded video frame.<br>
The reconstructed video frame is then used as the reference frame for the motion<br>
estimation of the later frames.<br>
The decoded video frame may then be used to encode inter-frames (P-<br>
frames or B-frames) that are defined relative to information in the decoded video frame.<br>
Specifically, a motion compensation (MC) unit 150 and a motion estimation (ME) unit<br>
160 are used to determine motion vectors and generate differential values used to encode<br>
inter-frames.<br>
A rate controller 190 receives information from many different<br>
components in a digital video encoder 100 and uses the information to allocate a bit<br>
, budget for each video frame. The rate controller 190 should allocate the bit budget in a<br>
manner that will generate the highest quality digital video bit stream that that complies<br>
with a specified set of restrictions. Specifically, the rate controller 190 attempts to<br>
generate the highest quality compressed video stream without overflowing buffers<br>
(exceeding the amount of available memory in a video decoder by sending more<br>
information than can be stored) or underflowing buffers (not sending video frames fast<br>
enough such that a video decoder runs out of video frames to display).<br>
Digital Video Encoding With Pixelblocks<br>
In some video signals the time between successive video pictures (frames<br>
or fields) may not be constant. (Note: This document will use the term video pictures to<br>
generically refer to video frames or video fields.) For example, some video pictures may<br>
be dropped because of transmission bandwidth constraints. Furthermore, the video<br>
timing may also vary due to camera irregularity or special effects such as slow motion or<br>
fast motion. In some video streams, the original video source may simply have non-<br>
uniform inter-picture times by design. For example, synthesized video such as computer<br>
graphic animations may have non-uniform timing since no arbitrary video timing is<br>
imposed by a uniform timing video capture system such as a video camera system. A<br>
flexible digital video encoding system should be able to handle non-uniform video picture<br>
timing.<br>
As previously set forth, most digital video encoding systems partition<br>
video pictures into a rectangular grid of pixelblocks. Each individual pixelblock in a<br>
video picture is independently compressed and encoded. Some video coding standards,<br>
e.g., ISO MPEG or ITU H.264, use different types of predicted pixelblocks to encode<br>
video pictures. In one scenario, a pixelblock may be one of three types:<br>
1. I-pixelblock - An Intra (I) pixelblock uses no information from any other video<br>
pictures in its coding (it is completely self-defined);<br>
2. P-pixelblock - A unidirectionally predicted (P) pixelblock refers to picture<br>
information from one preceding video picture; or<br>
3. B-pixelblock - A bi-directional predicted (B) pixelblock uses information from<br>
one preceding picture and one future video picture.<br>
If all the pixelblocks in a video picture are Intra-pixelblocks, then the<br>
video picture is an Intra-frame. If a video picture only includes unidirectional predicted<br>
macro blocks or intra-pixelblocks, then the video picture is known as a P-frame. If the<br>
video picture contains any bi-directional predicted pixelblocks, then the video picture is<br>
known as a B-frame. For the simplicity, this document will consider the case where all<br>
pixelblocks within a given picture are of the same type.<br>
An example sequence of video pictures to be encoded might be<br>
represented as:<br>
I1 B2 B3 B4 P5 B6 B7 B8 B9 P10 B11 P12 B13 Il4...<br>
where the letter (I, P, or B) represents if the video picture is an I-frame, P-frame, or B-<br>
frame and the number represents the camera order of the video picture in the sequence of<br>
video pictures. The camera order is the order in which a camera recorded the video<br>
pictures and thus is also the order in which the video pictures should be displayed (the<br>
display order).<br>
The previous example series of video pictures is graphically illustrated in<br>
Figure 2. Referring to Figure 2, the arrows indicate that pixelblocks from a stored<br>
picture (I-frame or P-frame in this case) are used in the motion compensated prediction of<br>
other pictures.<br>
In the scenario of Figure 2, no information from other pictures is used in<br>
the encoding of the intra-frame video picture I1. Video picture P5 is a P-frame that uses<br>
video information from previous video picture I1 in its coding such that an arrow is drawn<br>
from video picture I1 to video picture P5. Video picture B2, video picture B3, video<br>
picture B4 all use information from both video picture I1 and video picture P5 in their<br>
coding such that arrows are drawn from video picture I1 and video picture P5 to video<br>
picture B2, video picture B3, and video picture B4. As stated above the inter-picture times<br>
are, in general, not the same.<br>
Since B-pictures use information from future pictures (pictures that will be<br>
displayed later), the transmission order is usually different than the display order.<br>
Specifically, video pictures that are needed to construct other video pictures should be<br>
transmitted first. For the above sequence, the transmission order might be:<br>
I1 P5 B2 B3 B4 P10 B6 B7 B8 B9 P12 B11 I14 B13...<br>
Figure 3 graphically illustrates the preceding transmission order of the<br>
video pictures from Figure 2. Again, the arrows in the figure indicate that pixelblocks<br>
from a stored video picture (I or P in this case) are used in the motion compensated<br>
prediction of other video pictures.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the system first transmits I-frame I1 which does not<br>
depend on any other frame. Next, the system transmits P-frame video picture P5 that<br>
depends upon video picture I1. Next, the system transmits B-frame video picture B2 after<br>
video picture P5 even though video picture B2 will be displayed before video picture P5.<br>
The reason for this is that when it comes time to decode video picture B2, the decoder will<br>
have already received and stored the information in video pictures I1 and P5 necessary to<br>
decode video picture B2. Similarly, video pictures I1 and P5 are ready to be used to<br>
decode subsequent video picture B3 and video picture B4. The receiver/decoder reorders<br>
the video picture sequence for proper display. In this operation I and P pictures are often<br>
referred to as stored pictures.<br>
The coding of the P-frame pictures typically utilizes Motion<br>
Compensation, wherein a Motion Vector is computed for each pixelblock in the picture.<br>
Using the computed motion vector, a prediction pixelblock (P-pixelblock) can be formed<br>
by translation of pixels in the aforementioned previous picture. The difference between<br>
the actual pixelblock in the P-frame picture and the prediction pixelblock is then coded<br>
for transmission.<br>
P-Pictures<br>
The coding of P-Pictures typically utilize Motion Compensation (MC),<br>
wherein a Motion Vector (MV) pointing to a location in a previous picture is computed<br>
for each pixelblock in the current picture. Using the motion vector, a prediction<br>
pixelblock can be formed by translation of pixels in the aforementioned previous picture.<br>
The difference between the actual pixelblock in the P-Picture and the prediction<br>
pixelblock is then coded for transmission.<br>
Each motion vector may also be transmitted via predictive coding. For<br>
example, a motion vector prediction may be formed using nearby motion vectors. In such<br>
a case, then the difference between the actual motion vector and the motion vector<br>
prediction is coded for transmission.<br>
B-Pictures<br>
Each B-pixelblock uses two motion vectors: a first motion vector<br>
referencing the aforementioned previous video picture and a second motion vector<br>
referencing the future video picture. From these two motion vectors, two prediction<br>
pixelblocks are computed. The two predicted pixelblocks are then combined together,<br>
using some function, to form a final predicted pixelblock. As above, the difference<br>
between the actual pixelblock in the B-frame picture and the final predicted pixelblock is<br>
then encoded for transmission.<br>
As with P-pixelblocks, each motion vector (MV) of a B-pixelblock may be<br>
transmitted via predictive coding. Specifically, a predicted motion vector is formed using<br>
nearby motion vectors. Then, the difference between the actual motion vector and the<br>
predicted is coded for transmission.<br>
However, with B-pixelblocks the opportunity exists for interpolating<br>
motion vectors from motion vectors in the nearest stored picture pixelblock. Such motion<br>
vector interpolation is carried out both in the digital video encoder and the digital video<br>
decoder.<br>
This motion vector interpolation works particularly well on video pictures<br>
from a video sequence where a camera is slowly panning across a stationary background.<br>
In fact, such motion vector interpolation may be good enough to be used alone.<br>
Specifically, this means that no differential information needs be calculated or transmitted<br>
for these B-pixelblock motion vectors encoded using interpolation.<br>
To illustrate further, in the above scenario let us represent the inter-picture<br>
display time between pictures i and j as Dij, i.e., if the display times of the pictures are Ti<br>
and Tj, respectively, then<br>
Di, j = Ti - Tj from which it follows that<br>
Di,k = Di,j + Dj,k<br>
Di,k = -Dk,i<br>
Note that Dij may be negative in some cases.<br>
Thus, if MV5,1 is a motion vector for a P5 pixelblock as referenced to I1,<br>
then for the corresponding pixelblocks in B2, B3 and B4 the motion vectors as referenced<br>
to I1 and P5, respectively would be interpolated by<br>
MV2,1 = MV5,1*D2,1/D5,1<br>
MV5,2 = MV5,1*D5,2/D5,1<br>
MV3,1 = MV5,1*D3,1/D5,1<br>
MV5,3 = MV5,1*D5,3/D5,1<br>
MV4,1 = MV5,1*D4,1/D5,1<br>
MV5,4 = MV5,1*D5,4/D5,1<br>
Note that since ratios of display times are used for motion vector prediction, absolute<br>
display times are not needed. Thus, relative display times may be used for Dij inter-<br>
picture display time values.<br>
 This scenario may be generalized, as for example in the H.264 standard.<br>
In the generalization, a P or B picture may use any previously transmitted picture for its<br>
motion vector prediction. Thus, in the above case picture B3 may use picture I1 and<br>
picture B2 in its prediction. Moreover, motion vectors may be extrapolated, not just<br>
interpolated. Thus, in this case we would have:<br>
MV3,1 = MV2,1*D3,1/D2,1<br>
Such motion vector extrapolation (or interpolation) may also be used in the prediction<br>
process for predictive coding of motion vectors.<br>
Encoding Inter-Picture Display Times<br>
The variable inter-picture display times of video sequences should be<br>
encoded and transmitted in a manner that renders it possible to obtain a very high coding<br>
efficiency and has selectable accuracy such that it meets the requirements of a video<br>
decoder. Ideally, the encoding system should simplify the tasks for the decoder such that<br>
relatively simple computer systems can decode the digital video.<br>
The variable inter-picture display times are potentially needed in a number<br>
of different video encoding systems in order to compute differential motion vectors,<br>
Direct Mode motion vectors, and/or Implicit B Prediction Block Weighting.<br>
The problem of variable inter-picture display times in video sequences is<br>
intertwined with the use of temporal references. Ideally, the derivation of correct pixel<br>
values in the output pictures in a video CODEC should be independent of the time at<br>
which that picture is decoded or displayed. Hence, timing issues and time references<br>
should be resolved outside the CODEC layer.<br>
There are both coding-related and systems-related reasons underlying the<br>
desired time independence. In a video CODEC, time references are used for two<br>
purposes:<br>
(1) To establish an ordering for reference picture selection; and<br>
(2) To interpolate motion vectors between pictures.<br>
To establish an ordering for reference picture selection, one may simply send a relative<br>
position value. For example, the difference between the frame position N in decode order<br>
and the frame position M in the display order, i.e., N-M. In such an embodiment, time-<br>
stamps or other time references would not be required. To interpolate motion vectors,<br>
temporal distances would be useful if the temporal distances could be related to the<br>
interpolation distance. However, this may not be true if the motion is non-linear.<br>
Therefore, sending parameters other than temporal information for motion vector<br>
interpolation seems more appropriate.<br>
In terms of systems, one can expect that a typical video CODEC is part of<br>
a larger system where the video CODEC coexists with other video (and audio) CODECs.<br>
In such multi-CODEC systems, good system layering and design requires that general<br>
functions, which are logically CODEC-independent such as timing, be handled by the<br>
layer outside the CODEC. The management of timing by the system and not by each<br>
CODEC independently is critical to achieving consistent handling of common functions<br>
such as synchronization. For instance in systems that handle more than one stream<br>
simultaneously, such as a video/audio presentation, timing adjustments may sometimes<br>
be needed within the streams in order to keep the different streams synchronized.<br>
Similarly, in a system that handles a stream from a remote system with a different clock<br>
timing adjustments may be needed to keep synchronization with the remote system. Such<br>
timing adjustments may be achieved using time stamps. For example, time stamps that<br>
are linked by means of "Sender Reports" from the transmitter and supplied in RTP in the<br>
RTP layer for each stream may be used for synchronization. These sender reports may<br>
take the form of:<br>
Video RTP TimeStamp X is aligned with reference timestamp Y<br>
Audio RTP TimeStamp W is aligned with reference timestamp Z<br>
Wherein the wall-clock rate of the reference timestamps is known, allowing the two<br>
streams to be aligned. However, these timestamp references arrive both periodically and<br>
separately for the two streams, and they may cause some needed re-alignment of the two<br>
streams. This is generally achieved by adjusting the video stream to match the audio or<br>
vice-versa. System handling of time stamps should not affect the values of the pixels<br>
being displayed. More generally, system handling of temporal information should be<br>
performed outside the CODEC.<br>
A Specific Example<br>
As set forth in the previous section, the problem in the case of non uniform<br>
inter-picture times is to transmit the inter-picture display time values Dij to the digital<br>
video receiver in an efficient manner. One method of accomplishing this goal is to have<br>
the system transmit the display time difference between the current picture and the most<br>
recently transmitted stored picture for each picture after the first picture. For error<br>
resilience, the transmission could be repeated several times within the picture. For<br>
example, the display time difference may be repeated in the slice headers of the MPEG or<br>
H.264 standards. If all slice headers are lost, then presumably other pictures that rely on<br>
the lost picture for decoding information cannot be decoded either.<br>
Thus, with reference to the example of the preceding section, a system<br>
would transmit the following inter-picture display time values:<br>
D5,1 D2,5 D3,5 D4,5 D10,5 D6,10 D7,10 D8,10 D9,10 D12,10 D11,12 D14,12 D13,14 ...<br>
For the purpose of motion vector estimation, the accuracy requirements for the inter-<br>
picture display times Dij may vary from picture to picture. For example, if there is only a<br>
single B-frame picture B6 halfway between two P-frame pictures P5 and P7, then it<br>
suffices to send only:<br>
D7,5 = 2 and D6,7 = -1<br>
where the Dij inter-picture display time values are relative time values.<br>
If, instead, video picture B6 is only one quarter the distance between video<br>
picture P5 and video picture P7 then the appropriate Dij inter-picture display time values<br>
to send would be:<br>
D7,5 = 4 and D6,7 = -1<br>
Note that in both of the preceding examples, the display time between the video picture<br>
B6 and video picture video picture P7 (inter-picture display time D6,7) is being used as the<br>
display time "unit" value. In the most recent example, the display time difference<br>
between video picture P5 and picture video picture P7 (inter-picture display time D6,7) is<br>
four display time "units" (4 * D6,7) .<br>
Improving Decoding Efficiency<br>
In general, motion vector estimation calculations are greatly simplified if<br>
divisors are powers of two. This is easily achieved in our embodiment if Dij (the inter-<br>
picture time) between two stored pictures is chosen to be a power of two as graphically<br>
illustrated in Figure 4. Alternatively, the estimation procedure could be defined to<br>
truncate or round all divisors to a power of two.<br>
In the case where an inter-picture time is to be a power of two, the number<br>
of data bits can be reduced if only the integer power (of two) is transmitted instead of the<br>
full value of the inter-picture time. Figure 4 graphically illustrates a case wherein the<br>
distances between pictures are chosen to be powers of two. In such a case, the D3,1<br>
display time value of 2 between video picture P1 and picture video picture P3 is<br>
transmitted as 1 (since 21 = 2) and the D7,3 display time value of 4 between video picture<br>
P7 and picture video picture P3 can be transmitted as 2 (since 22 = 4).<br>
Alternatively, the motion vector interpolation of extrapolation operation<br>
can be approximated to any desired accuracy by scaling in such a way that the<br>
denominator is a power of two. (With a power of two in the denominator division may be<br>
performed by simply shifting the bits in the value to be divided.) For example,<br>
D5,4/D5,1 - Z5,4/P<br>
Where the value P is a power of two and Z5,4 - P*D5,4/D5,1 is rounded or truncated to the<br>
nearest integer. The value of P may be periodically transmitted or set as a constant for the<br>
system. In one embodiment, the value of P is set as P = 28 = 256.<br>
The advantage of this approach is that the decoder only needs to compute<br>
Z5,4 once per picture or in many cases the decoder may pre-compute and store the Z value.<br>
This allows the decoder to avoid having to divide by D5,1 for every motion vector in the<br>
picture such that motion vector interpolation may be done much more efficiently. For<br>
example, the normal motion vector calculation would be:<br>
MV5,4 = MV5,1*D5,4/D5,1<br>
But if we calculate and store Z5,4 wherein Z5,4 = P*D5,4/D5,1 then<br>
MV5,4 = MV5,1*Z5,4/P<br>
But since the P value has been chosen to be a power of two, the division by P is merely a<br>
simple shift of the bits. Thus, only a single multiplication and a single shift are required<br>
to calculate motion vectors for subsequent pixelblocks once the Z value has been<br>
calculated for the video picture. Furthermore, the system may keep the accuracy high by<br>
performing all divisions last such that significant bits are not lost during the calculation.<br>
In this manner, the decoder may perform exactly the same as the motion vector<br>
interpolation as the encoder thus avoiding any mismatch problems that might otherwise<br>
arise.<br>
Since division (except for division by powers of two) is a much more<br>
computationally intensive task for a digital computer system than addition or<br>
multiplication, this approach can greatly reduce the computations required to reconstruct<br>
pictures that use motion vector interpolation or extrapolation.<br>
In some cases, motion vector interpolation may not be used. However, it<br>
is still necessary to transmit the display order of the video pictures to the receiver/player<br>
system such that the receiver/player system will display the video pictures in the proper<br>
order. In this case, simple signed integer values for Dij suffice irrespective of the actual<br>
display times. In some applications only the sign (positive or negative) may be needed to<br>
reconstruct the picture ordering.<br>
The inter-picture times Dij may simply be transmitted as simple signed<br>
integer values. However, many methods may be used for encoding the Dij values to<br>
achieve additional compression. For example, a sign bit followed by a variable length<br>
coded magnitude is relatively easy to implement and provides coding efficiency.<br>
One such variable length coding system that may be used is known as<br>
UVLC (Universal Variable Length Code). The UVLC variable length coding system is<br>
given by the code words:<br>
1 = 1<br>
2 = 0 1 0<br>
3 = 0 1 l<br>
4 = 0 0 1 0 0<br>
5 = 0 0 1 0 1<br>
6 = 0 0 1 1 0<br>
7 = 0 0 1 1 1<br>
8 = 000100 0...<br>
Another method of encoding the inter-picture times may be to use<br>
arithmetic coding. Typically, arithmetic coding utilizes conditional probabilities to effect<br>
a very high compression of the data bits.<br>
Thus, the present invention introduces a simple but powerful method of<br>
encoding and transmitting inter-picture display times and methods for decoding those <br>
inter-picture display times for use in motion vector estimation. The encoding of inter-<br>
picture display times can be made very efficient by using variable length coding or<br>
arithmetic coding. Furthermore, a desired accuracy can be chosen to meet the needs of<br>
the video codec, but no more.<br>
The foregoing has described a system for specifying variable accuracy<br>
inter-picture timing in a multimedia compression and encoding system. It is<br>
contemplated that changes and modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art, to the materials and arrangements of elements of the present invention without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention.<br>

system that quickly calculates estimated motion vectors in a very efficient<br>
manner (Fig.1, Item 160). In one embodiment, a first multiplicand is determined<br>
by multiplying a first display time difference between a first video picture and a<br>
second video picture by a power of two scale value (Fig.1, items 150, 160). This<br>
step scales up a numerator for a ratio (Fig.1, item 120). Next, the system<br>
determines a scaled ratio by dividing that scaled numerator by a second first<br>
display time difference between the second video picture and a third video<br>
picture. The scaled ratio is then stored calculating motion vector estimations. By<br>
storing the scaled ratio, all the estimated motion vectors can be calculated<br>
quickly with good precision since the scaled ratio saves significant bits and<br>
reducing the scale is performed by simple shifts (Fig.1, item 180).</td>
