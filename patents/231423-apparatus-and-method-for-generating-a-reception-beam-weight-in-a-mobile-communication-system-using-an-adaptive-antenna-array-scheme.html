				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	field of thc Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for<br>
receiving data in a mobile communication system using an Adaptive Antenna<br>
Array (AAA) scheme, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for receiving<br>
data using an adaptive reception beam weight generation scheme.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
A "next generation mobile communication system" has evolved into a<br>
packet service communication system that transmits burst packet data to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations (MSs). The packet service communication system is<br>
designed to transmit mass data. Such a packet service communication system has<br>
been developing for high-speed packet service. In this regard, the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP). a standardization organization for an asynchronous<br>
communication scheme, proposes a High Speed Downlink Packet Access<br>
(HSDPA) to provide the high-speed packet service, while the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2). a standardization organization for a synchronous<br>
communication scheme, proposes a 1x Evolution Data Only Voice (1x EV-DO V)<br>
to provide the high-speed packet service. Both the HSDPA and the lx EV-DO V<br>
intend to provide high-speed packet service for smooth transmission of<br>
Web Internet service, and in order to provide the high-speed packet service, a<br>
peak throughput and average throughput should be optimized for smooth<br>
transmission of the packet data as well as the circuit data. e.g.. voice service data.<br>
In order to support the high-speed transmission of packet data, a<br>
communication system employing the IISDPA (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
"IISDPA communication system") has newly introduced 3 kinds of data<br>
transmission schemes: an Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme: a<br>
Hybrid Automatic Retransmission Request (HARQ) scheme: and a Fast Cell<br>
Selection (FCS) scheme. The HSDPA communication system increases a data rate<br><br>
using the AMC. HARQ. and FCS sehemes.<br>
A communication system using the 1x EV-DO V (hereinafter referred to<br>
as a "1x EV-DO'V communication system") is another communication system for<br>
increasing a data rale. The lx EV-DO V communication system also increases a<br>
data rate to secure system performance. Aside from the new schemes such as<br>
AMC, HARQ and FCS. there is a Multiple Antenna scheme, which is another<br>
scheme for coping with the limitation in assigned bandwidth, i.e.. increasing a<br>
data rate. The Multiple Antenna scheme can overcome the limitation of<br>
bandwidth resource in a frequency domain because it utilizes a space domain.<br>
A communication system is constructed such that a plurality of MSs<br>
communicate with each other via one base station (BS). When the BS performs a<br>
high-speed data transmission to the MSs. a fading phenomenon occurs due to a<br>
characteristic of radio channels. In order to overcome the fading phenomenon, a<br>
Transmit Antenna Diversity scheme, which is a kind of the Multiple Antenna<br>
scheme, has been proposed. The Transmit Antenna Diversity scheme transmits<br>
signals using at least two transmission antennas to minimize a loss of<br>
transmission data due to the fading phenomenon, thereby increasing a data rale.<br>
Generally, in a wireless channel environment in a mobile communication<br>
system, unlike in a wired channel environment, a transmission signal is actually<br>
distorted due to several factors, such as multipath interference, shadowing, wave<br>
attenuation, lime-varying noise, interference, etc. Fading caused by the multipath<br>
interference is closely related to the mobility of a reflector or a user (or aMS). and<br>
actually, a mixture of a transmission signal and an interference signal is received.<br>
Therefore, the received signal suffers from severe distortion during its actual<br>
transmission, thereby reducing performance of the entire mobile communication<br>
system. The fading may result in the distortion in the amplitude and the phase of<br>
the received signal, preventing high-speed data communication in the wireless<br>
channel environment. Many studies are being conducted in order to resolve the<br>
fading. Accordingly, in order to transmit data at a high speed, the mobile<br>
communication system must minimize a loss caused by a characteristic of a<br>
mobile communication channel, such as fading, and interference of an individual<br>
user. A diversity scheme is used to prevent unstable communication due to the<br><br>
fading, and multiple antennas are used to implement a Space Diversity scheme.<br>
Transmit Antenna Diversity is popularly used as a scheme for efficiently<br>
resolving the fading phenomenon. The Transmit Antenna Diversity scheme<br>
receives a plurality of transmission signals that have experienced an independent<br>
fading phenomena in a wireless channel environment, thereby coping with<br>
distortion caused by the fading. The Transmit Antenna Diversity is classified into<br>
Time Diversity, frequency Diversity. Multipath Diversity, and Space Diversity. In<br>
other words, a mobile communication system must cope well with the fading<br>
phenomenon that severely affects communication performance, in order to<br>
perform the high-speed data communication.<br>
As indicated above, the fading phenomenon must be overcome because it<br>
reduces the amplitude of a received signal up to several dB to tens of dB. For<br>
example, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme utilizes a Rake<br>
receiver that can achieve diversity performance using a delay spread of the<br>
channel. The Rake receiver is a kind of a Receive Diversity scheme for receiving<br>
multipath signals. However, the Receive Diversity used in the Rake receiver is<br>
disadvantageous in that it cannot achieve a desired diversity gain when the delay<br>
spread of the channel is relatively small.<br>
The Time Diversity scheme efficiently copes with burst errors occurring<br>
in a wireless channel environment using interleaving and coding, and is generally<br>
used in a Doppler spread channel. Disadvantageously, however, the Time<br>
Diversity does not work well in a low-speed Doppler spread channel.<br>
The Space Diversity scheme is generally used in a channel with a low<br>
delay spread such as an indoor channel and a pedestrian channel, which is a low-<br>
speed Doppler spread channel. The Space Diversity scheme achieves a diversity<br>
gain using at least two antennas. In this scheme, when a signal transmitted via one<br>
antenna is attenuated due to fading, a signal transmitted via another antenna is<br>
received, thereby acquiring a diversity gain. The Space Diversity is classified into<br>
Receive Antenna Diversity using a plurality of reception antennas and Transmit<br>
Antenna Diversity using a plurality of transmission antennas.<br><br>
In the Rcceive-Adaptive Antenna Array (Rx-AAA) scheme, hy<br>
calculating a scalar product of an appropriate reception beam weight vector and a<br>
signal vector of a reception signal received via an antenna array comprised of a<br>
plurality of reception antennas, a signal received in a direction desired by a<br>
receiver is maximized and a signal received in a direction not desired by the<br>
receiver is minimized. Herein, the reception beam weight represents a weight for<br>
generating the reception beam generated by the receiver in applying the Rx-AAA<br>
scheme. As a result, the Rx-AAA scheme amplifies only a desired reception<br>
signal to a maximum level, thereby maintaining a high-quality call and increasing<br>
the entire system capacity and service coverage.<br>
Although the Rx-AAA scheme can be applied to both a frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (FDMA) mobile communication system and a Time<br>
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) mobile communication system, it will be<br>
assumed herein that the Rx-AAA scheme is applied to a communication system<br>
using CDMA schemes (hereinafter referred to as a "CDMA communication<br>
system").<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a BS receiver in a<br>
conventional CDMA mobile communication system. Referring to FIG. 1. the US<br>
receiver is comprised of N reception antennas (Rx ANT) including a first<br>
reception antenna 111, a second reception antenna 121. and an Nth reception<br>
antenna 131. N radio frequency (RF) processors including a first RF processor<br>
112. a second RF processor 122-...-and an Nth RF processor 132. being mapped<br>
to the corresponding reception antennas. N mullipath searchers including a first<br>
multipath searcher 113. a second multipath searcher 123- ...- and an Nth multipath<br>
searcher 133. being coupled to the corresponding RF processors. I. fingers<br>
including a first finger 140-1. a second linger 140-2- ...- and an Lth finger 140-1..<br>
for processing L mullipath signals searched by the mullipath searchers, a<br>
mullipath combiner 150 for combining multipath signals output from the L<br>
fingers, a deinterleaver 160. and a decoder 170.<br>
Signals transmitted by transmitters in a plurality of MSs are received at<br>
the N reception antennas over a mullipath fading radio channel. The first<br>
reception antenna 111 outputs the received signal to the first RF processor 112.<br><br>
F.ach of the RF processors -includes an amplifier, a frequency converter, a filter,<br>
and an analog-to-digital (AD) converter, and processes an RF signal. The first RF<br>
processor 112 RF-processes a signal output from the first reception antenna 111 to<br>
convert the signal into a baseband digital signal, and outputs the baseband digital<br>
signal to the first multipath searcher 113. The first multipath searcher 113<br>
separates I. multipath components from a signal output from the first RF<br>
processor 112. The separated L multipath components are output to the first finger<br>
140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L. respectively.<br>
The first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L. being mapped to the L<br>
multiple paths on a one-to-one basis, process the I. multipath components.<br>
Because the L multiple paths arc considered for each of the signals received via<br>
the N reception antennas, signal processing must be performed on Nxl. signals,<br>
and among the NxL signals, signals on the same path are output to the same<br>
finger.<br>
Similarly, the second reception antenna 121 outputs the received signal to<br>
the second RF processor 122. The second RF processor 122 RF-processes a signal<br>
output from the second reception antenna 121 to convert the signal into a<br>
baseband digital signal, and outputs the baseband digital signal to the second<br>
multipath searcher 123. The second multipath searcher 123 separates 1.. multipath<br>
components from a signal output from the second RF processor 122. and the<br>
separated I, multipath components are output to the first finger 140-1 to the I.<br>
finger 140-L. respectively.<br>
In this same manner, the NTh reception antenna 131 outputs the received<br>
signal to the NTh RF processor 132. The NTh RF processor 132 RF-processes a<br>
signal output from the NTh reception antenna 131 to convert the signal into a<br>
baseband digital signal, and outputs the baseband digital signal to the NTh<br>
multipath searcher 133. The NTh multipath searcher 133 separates F multipath<br>
components from a signal output from the NTh RF processor 132. and the<br>
separated L multipath components are output to the first finger 140-1 to the LTh<br>
finger 140-L, respectively.<br>
Accordingly, among the L muliipalh signals for the signals received via<br><br>
the N reception antennas, the same multipath signals arc input to the same fingers,<br>
For example, first multipath signals from the first reception antenna 111 to the NTh<br>
reception antenna 131 are input to the first linger 140-1. In the same manner. LTh<br>
multipath signals from the first reception antenna III to the NTh reception antenna<br>
131 are input to the LTh finger 140-L. The first finger 140-1 to the LTh finger 140-1.<br>
are different only in signals input thereto and output therefrom, and arc identical<br>
in structure and operation. Therefore, only the lirst finger 140-1 will be described<br>
for simplicity.<br>
The first finger 140-1 has N despreaders including a first despreader 141,<br>
a second despreader 142. . and an Nth despreader 143. being mapped to the N<br>
multipath searchers, a signal processor 144 for calculating a weight vector for<br>
generating a reception beam using signals received from the N despreaders. and a<br>
reception beam generator 145 for generating a reception beam using the weight<br>
vector calculated by the signal processor 144.<br>
A lirst multipath signal output from the lirst multipath searcher 113 is<br>
input to the lirst despreader 141. The lirst despreader 141 despreads the first<br>
multipath signal output from the lirst multipath searcher 113 with a predetermined<br>
despreading code, and outputs the despread multipath signal to the signal<br>
processor 144 and the reception beam generator 145. Here, the despreading<br>
process is called "temporal processing." Similarly, a first multipath signal output<br>
from the second multipath searcher 123 is input to the second despreader 142.<br>
The second despreader 142 despreads the lirst multipath signal output from the<br>
second multipath searcher 123 with a predetermined despreading code, and<br>
outputs the despread multipath signal to the signal processor 144 and the<br>
reception beam generator 145. Similarly, a first multipath signal output from the<br>
Nth multipath searcher 133 is input to the Nth despreader 143. The Nth despreader<br>
143 despreads the first multipath signal output from the Nth multipath searcher<br>
133 with a predetermined despreading code, and outputs the despread multipath<br>
signal to the signal processor 144 and the reception beam generator 145.<br>
The signal processor 144 receives the signals output from the first<br>
despreader 141 to the Nth despreader 143. and calculates a reception beam weight<br>
set W_k for generating a reception beam. A set of first multipath signals output<br><br>
from the first multipath searcher 113 to the Nth multipath searcher 133 will be<br>
defined as " X R." The first multipath signal set X R represents a set of first<br>
multipath signals received via the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception<br>
antenna 131 at a kth point, and the first multipath signals constituting the first<br>
multipath signal set X R are all vector signals. The reception beam weight set<br>
WR represents a set of reception beam weights to be applied to the first multipath<br>
signals received via the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna<br>
131 at the kth point, and the reception beam weights constituting the weight set<br>
WR are all vector signals.<br>
A set of signals determined by despreading all of the first multipath<br>
signals in the first multipath signal set X R will be defined as yR . The despread<br>
signal set YR. of the first multipath signals represents a set of signals determined<br>
by despreading the first multipath signals received via the first reception antenna<br>
111 to the Nth reception antenna 131 at the kth point, and the despread signals<br>
constituting despread signal set yR of the first multipath signals are all vector<br>
signals. Herein, for the convenience of explanation, the term "set" will be omitted,<br>
and the underlined parameters represent sets of corresponding elements.<br>
Each of the first despreaders 141 to the Nth despreaders 143 despreads the<br>
first multipath signal XR with a predetermined despreading code, such that the<br>
reception power of a desired reception signal is greater than the reception power<br>
of an interference signal by a process gain. The despreading code is identical to<br>
the spreading code used in the transmitters of the MSs.<br>
As described above, the despread signal y of the first multipath signal<br>
XR is input to the signal processor 144. The signal processor 144 calculates a<br>
reception beam weight WR with the despread signal Y of the first multipath<br>
signal XR and outputs the reception beam weight IT. to the reception beam<br>
generator 145. As a result, the signal processor 144 calculates the reception beam<br>
weight WR including a total of N weight vectors applied to the first multipath<br>
signal XR. output from the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception<br>
antenna 131. with the despread signals yR of a total of N first multipath signals<br><br>
oulpul from the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131. The<br>
reception beam generator 145 recehes the despread signals yR of a total of the N<br>
first multipath signals XR and a total of the N reception beam weight vectors<br>
WR. The reception beam generator 145 generates a reception beam with a total of<br>
the N reception beam weight vectors W. calculates a scalar product of the<br>
despread signal yR of the first multipath signal X and the reception beam<br>
weight WR corresponding to the reception beam, and outputs the result as an<br>
output zk of the first finger 140-1. The output zk of the first linger 140-1 can be<br>
expressed as shown in Equation (1).<br>
Zk	- Wk H yk 	(1)<br>
In Equation (1). H denotes a Hermitian operator, i.e.. a conjugate-<br>
transpose. A set zk. of output signals zk from I. fingers in the BS receiver is<br>
finally input to the multipath combiner 150.<br>
Although only the first finger 140-1 has been described, the other fingers,<br>
the second linger 140-2 to the Lth finger 140-1., are to the same as the first finger<br>
140-1 in operation.<br>
The multipath combiner 150 combines the signals oulpul from the first<br>
finger 140-1 to the Lth linger 140-1., and outputs the combined signal to the<br>
deinterleaver 160. The deinterleaver 160 deinterleaves the signal output from the<br>
multipath combiner 150 in a deinterleaving method corresponding to the<br>
interleaving method used in the transmitter, and outputs the deinterleaved signal<br>
to the decoder 170. The decoder 170 decodes the signal output from the<br>
deinterleaver 160 in a decoding method corresponding to the encoding method<br>
used in the transmitter, and outputs the decoded signal as final reception data.<br>
The signal processor 144 calculates a reception beam weight WR such<br>
that a Mean Square Error (MSH) of a signal received from a MS transmitter,<br>
desired to be received by a predetermined algorithm, becomes minimized. The<br>
reception beam generator 145 generates a reception beam using the reception<br><br>
beam weight WR, generated by the signal processor 144. The process of<br>
generating a reception beam such that the MSI:, is minimized is called "spatial<br>
processing." When the Rx-AAA scheme is used in a CDMA mobile<br>
communication system, temporal processing and spatial processing are<br>
simultaneously performed. The operation of simultaneously performing temporal<br>
processing and spatial processing is called "spatial-temporal processing.*'<br>
The signal processor 144 receives multipath signals despread for each<br>
linger in the above-described manner, and calculates a reception beam weight<br>
capable of maximizing a gain of the Rx-AAA scheme according to a<br>
predetermined algorithm. The signal processor 144 minimizes the MSE.<br>
Currently, a great deal of research is being conducted on a reception beam<br>
weight calculation algorithm for adaplively minimizing the MSL:1. However, the<br>
reception beam weight calculation algorithm for adaptively minimizing the MSE<br>
is an algorithm for reducing errors on the basis of a reference signal, and this<br>
algorithm supports a Constant Modulus (CM) scheme and a Decision-Directed<br>
(DD) scheme as a blind scheme, when there is no reference signal.<br>
further, the algorithm for reducing errors on the basis of a reference<br>
signal has trouble converging into a minimum MSI value desired by the system<br>
in an environment where a channel such as a fast fading channel suffers from a<br>
rapid change, or an environment where a high-order modulation scheme such as<br>
16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) is used. liven though it<br>
converges into a particular MSE value, the minimum MSE value is set to a<br>
relatively large value. When the minimum MSE value is set to a relatively large<br>
value, a gain that occurs from using the Rx-AAA scheme is reduced. Therefore,<br>
this algorithm is not suitable for a high-speed data communication system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br><br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail herein below with re Terence to the annexed drawings. In the<br>
drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
Before a description of the present invention is given, a model of a<br>
reception signal received at a receiver of a base station (BS) will be considered. It<br>
is assumed that a receiver of the BS includes a receive-antenna array having a<br>
plurality of reception antennas (Rx ANTs), and the receive-antenna array is<br>
generally mounted only in the receiver of the BS considering its cost and size, and<br>
is not mounted in a receiver of a mobile station (MS). That is. it is assumed that<br>
the receiver of the MS includes only one reception antenna.<br>
Additionally, although the present invention is applicable to all of mobile<br>
communication systems using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA).<br>
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to an OFDM mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
A signal transmitted from a transmitter of an mth MS existing in a cell<br>
serviced by the BS is expressed as shown in Equation (2).<br><br>
In Kquation (2), sm(t) denotes a transmission signal of an m11 MS. pm<br>
denotes transmission power of the mth MS. bm(t) denotes a user information bit<br>
sequence of the mth MS. and em(t) denotes a user spreading code sequence of the<br>
mth MS. having a chip period of Tc.<br>
The transmission signal transmitted from the MS transmitter is received at<br>
a receiver of the BS over a multipath vector channel. It is assumed that channel<br>
parameters of the multipath vector channel are relatively and continuously<br><br>
changed, compared with the bit period Tb. Therefore, it is assumed that the<br>
channel parameters of the multipath vector channel are constant for certain bit<br>
periods.<br>
A complex base band reception signal for a first multipath of an mth MS.<br>
received at a receiver of the BS. is expressed by liquation (3). It should be noted<br>
that the reception signal of liquation (3) represents a base band signal determined<br>
by down-converting a radio frequency (RF) signal received at the BS receiver.<br><br>
In Equation (3).  denotes a set of complex base band reception<br>
signals received through a first multipath of the mth MS. αm1 denotes a fading<br>
attenuation applied to the first multipath of the mth MS. Φm1 denotes a phase<br>
transition applied to the first multipath of the mth MS. τm1 denotes a lime delay<br>
applied to the first multipath of the mth MS. and  denotes a set of array<br>
responses (ARs) applied to the first multipath of the mth MS. Because the BS<br>
receiver includes a plurality of antennas, for example. N reception antennas, a<br>
signal transmitted by the mth MS is received at the BS receiver via the N reception<br>
antennas. Therefore, the number of signals received via the first multipath is N.<br>
and N complex base band reception signals received via the first multipath of the<br>
mth MS constitute a set of the reception signals. Herein, for the convenience of<br>
explanation, the term "set" will be omitted, and the underlined parameters<br>
represent sets of corresponding elements.<br>
When a current linear antenna array is used, the array response am1 is<br>
defined as shown in Equations (4).<br><br>
In Equation (4). 'd' denotes a distance between separated reception<br>
antennas. λ denotes a wavelength at a frequency band in use. N denotes the<br><br>
number of the reception antennas, and 0m1 denotes direction-of-arrival (DOA)<br>
applied to the first multipath of the mth MS.<br>
If it is assumed that the number of MSs existing in a cell serviced by the<br>
BS is M and there are L multiple paths for each of the M MSs. a reception signal<br>
received at the BS becomes the sum of transmission signals transmitted from the<br>
M MSs and additive white noise (AWN), as represented in liquation (5).<br><br>
In Equation (5). n(l) denotes the additive while noise added to the<br>
transmission signals transmitted from the M MSs.<br>
It is assumed that a signal the BS desires to receive in the reception signal<br>
of Hquation (5) is x11, x11 represents a signal a first MS has transmitted via a<br>
first multipath. Because it is assumed thai a signal the BS desires to receive is x11.<br>
all signals except the signal x11 are regarded as interference signals and noise.<br>
Therefore. liquation (5) can be rewritten as shown in liquation (6).<br><br>
In liquation (6), i(l) denotes an interference signal, which is defined in<br>
liquation (7). below.<br><br>
The first term of Equation (7) is a transmission signal of a MS<br>
that the BS desires to receive, but represents the inter-path interference (IPI) by<br>
other multiple paths lhat the BS does not desire to receive. The second term<br><br>
  (7) represents the multiple access interference (MAI) by<br>
Further, the x(l) is desprcad with a desprcading code C1(1-τ11) previously<br>
set in a first finger (1-1) for a corresponding multipath in a corresponding channel<br>
card of the BS receiver, i.e.. a channel card (m-1) assigned to the first MS. and<br>
the desprcad signal y(l) is defined in Fquation (8) below. The despreading code<br>
C1(1-τ11) is identical to the despreading code c,(t-Tn) used in a BS transmitter<br>
during signal transmission. The BS includes a plurality of receivers as described<br>
in conjunction with FIG. 1. Hach of the receivers is called a "channel card." and<br>
one channel card is assigned to one MS. As described in connection with FIG. 1.<br>
the channel card includes as many lingers as the number of multiple paths, and<br>
the fingers are mapped to corresponding multipath signals on a one-to-one basis.<br><br>
When the signal y(l) is generated by despreading the pre-despread<br>
signal x(l) with the despreading code C1(1-τ11), the power of a signal component<br>
the BS receiver desires to receive from among the reception signals is amplified<br>
by a gain G according to a characteristic of a despreader. It is noted that although<br>
the power of a signal component the BS receiver desires to receive is amplified<br>
by a process gain G. the power of the signal components the BS receiver does not<br>
desire to receive is not changed at all. Therefore, a correlation matrix between a<br>
reception signal before despreading and a reception signal after despreading can<br>
be calculated.<br>
In order to calculate the correlation matrix between a reception signal<br>
before despreading and a reception signal after despreading. the reception signal<br>
x(l) before despreading is sampled at a kth point, which is equal to the sampling<br>
point of the reception signal y(l) after desprcading. The signal obtained by<br><br>
sampling the reception signal x(l) before despreading at the kth point is<br>
represented by Equation (9).<br><br>
In conclusion, in order to calculate a correlation matrix between a<br>
reception signal x(l) before despreading and a reception signal y(l) after<br>
despreading. it is assumed that the signal of liquation (9) is acquired by sampling<br>
the reception signal x(l) before despreading at the kth point, which is equal to<br>
the sampling point of the reception signal y(l) after despreading. and that the<br>
reception signal x(l) before despreading and the reception signal y(l) after<br>
despreading are stationary.<br>
A description will now be made of a Least Mean Square (LMS) scheme<br>
and a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) scheme herein below.<br>
In the LMS scheme, a set of reception signals belbre despreading.<br>
including complex reception signals received via N reception antennas at a<br>
particular time. i.e.. complex reception signals x1 to xN received via a first<br>
reception antenna to an Nth reception antenna, will be defined as x -<br>
[X1,X2,...,XN]T. Here. "T" is an operator representing a transpose operation. In<br>
addition, a set of reception signals after despreading the complex reception<br>
signals X1, X2.... xN received via the N reception antennas will be defined as<br>
y=[y1,y2,... ,yN]T The reception signal y after despreading is determined by the<br>
sum of a signal component s the BS receiver desires to receive and a signal<br>
component u the BS receiver does not desire to receive, as represented by<br>
liquation (10).<br><br>
A set of complex reception beam weight values to be multiplied by the<br>
complex reception signals x1, x2,..., xN received via the N reception antennas, i.e..<br>
complex reception beam weights w1 to wN to be multiplied by complex reception<br><br>
signals x1 to xN received via the first reception antenna to the Nth reception<br>
antenna, will be defined as <br>
An output signal z from lingers in a particular user card. i.e.. a channel<br>
card assigned to a particular MS. is determined by calculating a scalar product of<br>
the reception beam weight w and the reception signal y after despreading. as<br>
represented by Equation (11).<br><br>
In liquation (11). 'i' denotes the number of reception antennas.<br>
The output signal z can be classified into a signal component wII s the<br>
BS receiver desires to receive, and a signal component wII u the BS receiver<br>
does not desire to receive, using liquation (10) and liquation (11). The LMS<br>
scheme minimizes errors of a known reference signal and a reception signal, and<br>
particularly, minimizes a cost function J(w). as given below in equation (12).<br><br>
In liquation (12). 'J' denotes a cost function, and a reception beam weight<br>
value w for minimizing the cost function value J must be determined, further, in<br>
Hquation (12). ck denotes a difference, or an error, between a reception signal and<br>
a desired reception signal, and dk denotes the desired signal. In a reception beam<br>
algorithm using a non-blind scheme, a pilot signal is used as the desired signal dk<br>
by way of example. However, the present invention proposes a reception beam<br>
algorithm using a blind scheme, such that a detailed description of the reception<br>
beam algorithm using the non-blind scheme will be omitted.<br>
In liquation (12). the cost function J is a type of a second-order convex<br>
function. Therefore, in order to minimize the cost function J. the cost function J<br><br>
must be differentiated until its value becomes 0. A differentiated value of the cost<br>
function .) is shown below in Equation (13).<br><br>
However, it is difficult to acquire an optimal reception beam weight wII<br>
in an actual channel environment in a single process, and because the reception<br>
signal y after despreading is input at each point, a recursive formula of<br>
liquation (14) should be used in order to adaptive!}' or recursively acquire the<br>
optimal reception beam weight wII.<br><br>
In Hqualion (14), 'k' denotes a kth point. wR denotes a reception beam<br>
weight at the kth point, µ denotes a constant gain, and vR denotes a trace vector<br>
at the kth point. The trace vector v at the kth point represents a vector for<br>
converging a differentiated value of the cost function J to a minimum value, for<br>
example. 0. That is. liquation (14) shows a process of updating a value generated<br>
before or after a constant gain µ from a given reception beam weight wR to be<br>
used at a current point in a direction of the trace vector vR as a reception beam<br>
weight wR-1 to be used at the next point.<br>
The scheme for delecting a desired reception signal d(k). proposed in the<br>
present invention, is called a "blind scheme." Due to the use of the blind scheme,<br>
a received signal should be adaptively converged using a particular estimation<br>
value, and a below scheme is used for the adaptive convergence of the received<br>
signal.<br>
A combination mode blind scheme is used for detecting a desired received<br>
signal d(k). In this case, an error function is expressed as shown in liquation (15).<br><br><br>
In Equation (15).  arc delected error values by applying<br>
Constant Modulus (CM) scheme and Decision Directed (DD) scheme to the<br>
received signal for an adaptive convergence of the received signal. The <br>
will be described herein below.<br>
In the present invention, as indicated above.  are detected by<br>
applying combination of the CM scheme and the DD scheme to the received<br>
signal for an adaptive convergence of the received signal. That is. when the <br>
value is increased, a  value is also increased. Consequently, an influence<br>
of the DD scheme is increased to a total error value.<br>
In Equation (15). g(x) is an s shape-function (sigmoid function).<br>
Accordingly, in a region with a large influence of the CM scheme, an influence of<br>
the DD scheme is decreased. In contrast, in a region with a large influence of the<br>
DD scheme, an influence of the CM scheme is decreased.<br>
In Hqualion (15). the error value ek is an error value by combining a value<br>
by applying a weight ak to the ekCM and a value by applying a weight P to<br>
the ekDD. Herein, the weight ak is a weight applied to the CM scheme as -CM<br>
scheme application weight, and the weight βk is a weight applied to the DD<br>
scheme as "DD scheme application weight'. Therefore, the error value ek is an<br>
error value detected by setting adaptively the weight ak and the weight P<br>
according to whether or not the error value of the received signal was converged.<br><br>
Additionally, the characteristic of sigmoid function g(x) will be described<br>
herein below.<br>
The FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating the characteristic of sigmoid function<br>
used in an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2. the<br>
characteristic of sigmoid function is changed according to value 'a'. When the<br>
value a increases, a shape of sigmoid function is closed to an 's' shape. When the<br>
value a is equal to 1 (a _ 1). the shape of sigmoid function is closed to a<br>
"straight line" shape. That is, when the CM scheme application weight ak is<br>
increased, the DD scheme application weight βk is decreased. However, when<br>
the CM scheme application weight αk is decreased, the DD scheme application<br>
weight βk is increased.<br>
If the error value ek calculated using the CM scheme is greater than the<br>
error value ek calculated using the DD scheme, the error value ek will be<br>
calculated by combining a weighted CM scheme and a more weighted DD<br>
scheme, compared with the weighted CM scheme.<br>
Herein, the weighted CM scheme is used to apply the CM scheme<br>
application weight αk to the CM scheme. The weighted DD scheme is used to<br>
apply the DD scheme application w eight βk to the DD scheme. The "more<br>
weighted DD scheme as compared with the weighted CM scheme" refers to the<br>
DD scheme application weight βk being greater than the CM scheme application<br>
weight αk. In the same manner, the "more weighted CM scheme as compared<br>
with the weighted DD scheme refers" to the CM scheme application weight a<br>
being greater than the DD scheme application weight βk.<br>
Additionally, if the error value ek calculated by using the CM scheme is<br>
equal or smaller than the error value ek calculated by using the DD scheme, the<br>
error value ek will be calculated by combining a weighted DD scheme and a more<br>
weighted CM scheme, compared with the weighted DI) scheme.<br>
A constant modulus (CM) scheme, which is used for adaptive<br><br>
convergence of the received signal, is generally used in a blind equalizer and also<br>
used for a generation algorithm. When the CM scheme proposed by Godard is<br>
used, the cost function J is expressed as shown in Equation (16) below.<br><br>
In liquation (16). 'p' denotes a particular positive integer, and Rp denotes<br>
a Godard modulus. The Godard modulus Rp is defined as shown in liquation (17).<br><br>
Because the current OFDM mobile communication system generally uses<br>
a high-order modulation scheme, which is higher in order than quadrature phase<br>
shift keying (QPSK) modulation, the cost function .1 is separated into a real part<br>
and an imaginary part as shown in liquation (18). The cost function .1 is separated<br>
into a real part and an imaginary part because transmission reception signals in<br>
the high-order modulation scheme have a real part and an imaginary part.<br><br>
It is assumed herein that the present invention uses the FMS scheme and<br>
the MMSF. scheme, and p-2. Therefore. d(k)=R2.R+jR2.1. In addition, it is assumed<br>
that a cost function value J at an initial point, i.e.. a k=0 point, is 0 (J=0).<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a CM scheme in an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system. Referring to FIG. 5. a CM scheme for p=2. d(k)-<br>
R2.R-jR2.1, and J-0 at a point with k-0. That is, if a value R2 is determined by<br><br>
liquation (18). a circle is generated on a coordinate surface. Then, a received<br>
signal is determined as a point where an extension line drawn from the origin<br>
meets the circle. In FIG. 5. received zk is projected as a circle.<br>
Above, the convergence step has been described. Herein below, a<br>
stabilizing step for acquiring the d(k) will be described.<br>
If MSE is converged into a predetermined value through the convergence<br>
step, a change occurs from the convergence step to the stabilization step where<br>
calculation of Equation 19 is performed. A process where a change occurs from<br>
the convergence step to the stabilization step as the MSF. is converged into a<br>
predetermined value will be described later on.<br><br>
In the stabilization step, like in the convergence step, a real part and an<br>
imaginary part are separately calculated. In liquation (19). Pr denotes a received<br>
signal is projected as a signal most approximating the desired reception signal<br>
d(k) by a DD scheme. The DD scheme is a scheme for reflecting the d(k) as a<br>
decision value most approximating the received signal.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a DD scheme in an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). Referring to<br>
FIG. 6, because it is assumed that the 01 DM mobile communication system uses<br>
BPSK. if a reception signal is (1.2. -0.2) in an I-Q domain, the desired reception<br>
signal d(k) is projected as the largest approximate value of 1 after calculating a<br>
distance from - 1 and -1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a BS receiver according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. While describing FIG. 3. it should be noted<br>
that a BS receiver according to the First embodiment of the present invention is<br>
similar in structure to the BS receiver described in connection with FIG. 1. but<br>
different in a method for determining a reception beam weight by a signal<br>
processor. For simplicity, only the elements directly related to the present<br><br>
invention in the BS receiver will be described with reference to FIG. 3. Further,<br>
the first embodiment of the present invention corresponds to an embodiment<br>
where the LMS scheme is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3. when a reception signal x, at a timing point k is<br>
received, a despreader 310 despreads the reception signal xk, using a<br>
predetermined despreading code, and outputs the despread reception signal y<br>
to a signal processor 330 and a reception beam generator 320. The signal<br>
processor 330 includes a weight calculator 331. a memory 333. and an error value<br>
combiner 335. For simplicity. FIG. 3 will be described with reference to only the<br>
first finger 140-1 in the BS receiver of FIG. 1. Therefore, the desprcader 310 of<br>
FIG. 3 is substantially identical in operation to the N despreaders of the first<br>
despreader 141 to the Nth desprcader 143 in the first finger 140-1.<br>
The error value combiner 335 inputs the despread reception signal y .<br>
and combines an error value ek by using the CM scheme and the DD scheme. The<br>
weight calculator 331 in the signal processor 330 calculates a reception beam<br>
weight wR by receiving the combined error value ek . the despread reception<br>
signal yk a predetermined constant gain µ. and an initial reception beam weight<br>
w0. and outputs the calculated reception beam weight to the memory 333. The<br>
memory 333 buffers the reception beam weight wR calculated by the weight<br>
calculator 331, and the weight calculator 331 uses the reception beam weight wR<br>
stored in the memory 333 when updating the reception beam weight wR. That is.<br>
the weight calculator 331 updates a reception beam weight wR. at the next<br>
timing point k+1 using the reception beam weight wR calculated at the timing<br>
point k.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception procedure by a BS<br>
receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG 4.<br>
in step 411. a BS receiver establishes an initial reception beam weight it, . and a<br>
constant gain µ. In step 413. the BS receiver determines if the communication has<br>
ended. If it is determined that the communication has ended, the BS receiver ends<br>
the ongoing procedure.<br><br>
If it is determined in step 413 that the eommunieation has not ended, the<br>
BS receiver proceeds to step 415. In step 415, the BS receiver receives a despread<br>
signal yk for the reception signal x. In step 417. the BS receiver calculates a<br>
set zk of signals zk output from respective fingers of the BS receiver using the<br>
despread signal yk and a reception beam weight The zR<br>
represents a set of finger output signals generated using a reception beam<br>
generated using the reception beam weight wR.<br>
In step 419. the BS receiver calculates an error value ek to decrease an<br>
error between the reception signal xk and a desired reception signal<br>
. In step 421. the BS receiver calculates a<br>
differentiated value of a cost function using the despread signal y. and the error<br>
function ek (VJ(wR) = -2ekyk). In step 423. the BS receiver calculates a reception<br>
beam coefficient, or a reception beam weight <br>
In step 425. the BS receiver maintains the calculated reception beam<br>
weight wR. In step 427. the BS receiver delays by a predetermined unit lime. The<br>
predetermined unit time is delayed in order to use a value determined at a kth snap<br>
for a (k-1)th snap. i.e.. to take a slate transition delay into consideration. In step<br>
429. the BS receiver increases the k by 1. i.e.. transitions from the current timing<br>
point k to the next timing point k+1. and then returns to step 413.<br>
FIG. 7 is a graph illustrating a characteristic curve for a general reception<br>
beam weight generation schemes and an reception beam weight generation<br>
scheme according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7.<br>
it is noted that an MSF value (y-axis) compared to a number of iterations (x-axis)<br>
for the reception beam weight generation scheme according to the present<br>
invention 703 is converged into a lower value, compared with an MSF value<br>
against the number of iterations for the conventional reception beam weight<br>
generation scheme 701, e.g.. a CM scheme. That the MSF value is converged into<br>
a less value means that a reception beam can be correctly generated, making it<br><br>
possible to correctly receive only a desired reception signal.<br>
FIG. 8 is a graph illustrating a characteristic curve according to the<br>
number of reception antennas of a BS receiver tor an adaptive reception beam<br>
weight generation scheme according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8. there is illustrated a radiation pattern for a BS receiver having<br>
6 reception antennas and a BS receiver having 10 reception antennas. For<br>
example, if it is assumed that a particular BS is located at 57°. it is noted that<br>
compared with the BS receiver having 6 reception antennas, the BS receiver<br>
having 10 reception antennas has a normalized antenna gain of about 0.2. and can<br>
more correctly generate a reception beam. As a result, in terms of capacity of an<br>
OFDM mobile communication system, an increase in the number of the reception<br>
antennas causes an increase in the amplitude of the reception signals enabling a<br>
correct communication, thereby contributing to an increase in system capacity.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9. the OFDM communication system includes a transmitter, i.e..<br>
an MS transmitter 900. and a receiver, i.e.. a BS receiver 950. The MS transmitter<br>
900 includes a symbol mapper 911, a serial-to-parallel (or S P) converter 913. a<br>
pilot pattern inserter 915. an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) unit 917. a<br>
parallel-to-serial (or P/S) converter 919. a guard interval inserter 921. a digital-to-<br>
analog (D/A) converter 923. and a radio frequency (RF) processor 925.<br>
When there are information data bits to be transmitted, the information<br>
data bits are input to the symbol mapper 911. The symbol mapper 911 modulates<br>
the input information data bits in a predetermined modulation scheme for symbol<br>
mapping, and outputs the symbol-mapped data bits to the serial-to-parallel<br>
converter 913. Here, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) or 16-ary quadrature<br>
amplitude modulation (I6QAM) can be used as the modulation scheme. The<br>
serial-to-parallel converter 913 parallel-converts serial modulation symbols<br>
output from the symbol mapper 911. and outputs the parallel-converted<br>
modulation symbols to the pilot pattern inserter 915. The pilot pattern inserter 915<br>
inserts pilot patterns in the parallel-converted modulation symbols output from<br>
the serial-to-parallel converter 913. and then outputs the pilot pattern-inserted<br><br>
modulation symbols to the IFFT unit 917.<br>
The IFFT unit 917 performs N-point IFFT on the signals output from the<br>
pilot pattern inserter 915. and outputs the resultant signals to the parallel-to-serial<br>
converter 919. The parallel-to-serial converter 919 serial-converts the signals<br>
output form the IFFT unit 917. and outputs the serial-convened signals to the<br>
guard interval inserter 921. The guard interval inserter 921 receives the signal<br>
output from the parallel-to-serial converter 919, inserts a guard interval therein,<br>
and outputs the guard interval-inserted signal to the digilal-to-analog converter<br>
923.<br>
The guard interval is inserted to remove interference between a previous<br>
OFDM symbol transmitted at a previous OFDM symbol time and a current<br>
OFDM symbol to be transmitted at a current OFDM symbol time in an 01 DM<br>
communication system. For the guard interval, a cyclic prefix method or a cyclic<br>
postfix method is used. In the cyclic prefix method, a predetermined number of<br>
last samples of an OFDM symbol in a lime domain are copied and inserted into a<br>
valid OFDM symbol. In the cyclic postfix method, a predetermined number of<br>
first samples of an OFDM symbol in a lime domain arc copied and inserted into a<br>
valid OFDM symbol.<br>
