"Backward Compatible Connector System," by Murphy et al., filed 01/05/2007, which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The present application claims<br>
benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/969,946<br>
(Attorney Docket No. 20750P-003300/P5379USP1), filed on September 4, 2007,<br>
titled "Smart Cables," the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates in general to electronic cables. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to smart cables that can provide additional<br>
functionality such as identification and authentication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The handheld consumer electronic market continues to grow at an extra-<br>
ordinary pace, and more of these products provide increasing interconnectivity with<br>
other electronic devices. By way of example, electronic products such as mobile<br>
phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), media players, CD players, DVD players,<br>
televisions, game players, digital cameras and the like invariably include connectors<br>
for making connection to other electronic devices via cables. The different types of<br>
digital or analog audio and/or video signals, USB, t-irewire, etc.<br>
[0004] Examples of media devices with a highly versatile connector system are the<br>
iPod and the iPhone manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. These<br>
media devices may communicate with their accessories and other peripheral devices<br>
 <br>
through one or more cable apparatus. For example, the media devices can send<br>
audio signals to a speaker, and/or send video signals to a computer display or<br>
television. In order to transmit various kinds of signals, different types of cables may<br>
be used. Different cables may have different performance characteristics and may<br>
be designed to operate with different communication protocols. Such information<br>
often needs to be efficiently communicated to the media devices. Hence it is highly<br>
desirable to improve electronic cabling techniques for media devices.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The present invention relates to smart cables that incorporate functionality to<br>
provide information such as identification and authentication to devices to which they<br>
connect. In various embodiments, a cabling apparatus includes circuitry that can<br>
communicate with another device information about the cable including, for example,<br>
whether the cable is an authorized cable, what type of cable it is, what type or types<br>
of signal(s) it can carry, etc. If the cable is, for example, a composite video or a<br>
component video cable connecting a media device to a display, circuitry incorporated<br>
in the cable apparatus, according to one embodiment of the present invention, can<br>
identify itself and can instruct the media device to supply the display with the<br>
appropriate composite or component video signal. The various embodiments of the<br>
invention are described in the context of media devices, but it should be recognized<br>
that the invention has broader range of applicability.<br>
[0006] According to one embodiment of the present invention, a cable apparatus<br>
may include a first connector including a housing, a plurality of contacts, and one or<br>
more processing components. Additionally, the cable apparatus may include a cable<br>
having a first end coupled to the first connector and a second end coupled to one or<br>
more second connectors. The one or more second connectors can be configured to<br>
connect with one or more electronic devices. The one or more processing<br>
components of the cable apparatus can be configured to rere ve an authentication<br>
inquiry from an electronic device through the plurality of contacts, generate an<br>
authentication response, and output the authentication response to the electronic<br>
device through the plurality of contacts. The authentication response may be<br>
 <br>
associated with whether the cable apparatus is an authorized accessory for the<br>
electronic device.<br>
[0007] According to another embodiment, a cable apparatus may include a first<br>
connector including a housing, a plurality of contacts, and one or more processing<br>
components. Additionally, the cable apparatus may include a cable having a first end<br>
coupled to the first connector and a second end coupled to one or more second<br>
connectors. The one or more second connectors can be configured to be coupled to<br>
one or more electronic devices respectively. The one or more processing<br>
components can be configured to identify a type of the cable apparatus, generate a<br>
cable identification signal, and output the identification signal to the electronic device<br>
through the plurality of contacts. The identification signal may be associated with<br>
one or more types of signals to be carried by the cable apparatus.<br>
[0008] According to another embodiment, a method for operating a cable apparatus<br>
includes providing the cable apparatus with circuitry to implement a cable<br>
identification process, the cable circuitry to be powered upon connection of the cable<br>
apparatus to another electronic device. The method includes the cable circuitry<br>
identifying the type of cable and generating a cable identification signal, and the<br>
cable circuitry transmitting the cable identification signal to the electronic device.<br>
The process of identifying the type of cable may include detecting a signal level on<br>
node in the cable circuitry. Alternatively, the process of identifying the type of cable<br>
may include transmitting one or more test signals to predetermined contacts coupled<br>
to the cable apparatus.<br>
[0009] According to another embodiment, a method for operating a cable apparatus<br>
includes providing the cable apparatus with circuitry to implement a cable<br>
authentication process, the cable circuitry to be powered upon connection of the<br>
cable apparatus to another electronic device. The method includes the cable<br>
circuitry receiving an authentication request from the electronic device and<br>
performing an authentication process. The cable circuitry then generating a cable<br>
authentication signal and transmitting the cable identification signal to the electronic<br>
device.<br>
 <br>
[0010] According to yet another embodiment, a method of operating a cable<br>
apparatus may include receiving an authentication inquiry by a cable apparatus from<br>
an electronic device, processing the authentication inquiry by the cable apparatus,<br>
sending an authentication response from the cable apparatus to the electronic<br>
device, receivintj an identification inquiry by the cable apparatus from the electronic<br>
device, identifying a cable type for the cable apparatus by the cable apparatus, and<br>
sending an identification signal based on at least information associated with the<br>
identified cable type. The authentication response can be associated with whether<br>
the cable apparatus is an authorized accessory for the electronic device, and the<br>
identification signal can be associated with one or more types of signals related to<br>
the cable apparatus.<br>
[0011] The various features and advantages of the present invention can be more<br>
fully appreciated with reference to the detailed description and accompanying<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] Figure 1 illustrates a simplified cable apparatus according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention that is capable of communicating information<br>
such as cable identification and authentication upon connection to another device.<br>
Cable apparatus 100 may include connector 110 at one end, one or more connector<br>
ends 120 at another end, and cable 130 as well as one or more cable lines 140 that<br>
couple the connector ends of the cable apparatus. Connector 110 may include<br>
contact housing 112 which encloses a plurality of electrical contacts (not shown),<br>
and connector boot 114 which houses the assembly that connects wires from the<br>
cable lines to the electrical contacts. Within connector boot 114, there can also be<br>
electronic components (not shown) that are configured to perform electrical<br>
functionality such as cable authentication, cable identification, electrostatic discharge<br>
protection and the like. One example of a connector assembly that can integrate<br>
such functionality onto, for example, a printed circuit board (PCB) inside the boot of<br>
the connector is described in the above-referenced patent application number<br>
11/650,330 (Attorney Docket No. 20750P-002400/P4998), titled "Backward<br>
Compatible Connector System," by Murphy et al., which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
[0018] Plurality of cable lines 140 may be configured to carry a respective plurality<br>
of signals, each line connecting to at least one of plurality of connectors 120. By way<br>
of example, plurality of connectors 120 may include at least an audio connector, a<br>
video connector, and/or a USB connector. If cable system 100 is configured to<br>
provide, for example, a composite video cable, the circuitry that may be integrated<br>
inside boot 114 of connector 110 can be configured to identify the type of cable and<br>
transmit that information (i.e., that the cable is a composite video cable) to the device<br>
to which it connects. The device could be, for example, a media device such as an<br>
iPod or an iPhone. The media device then automatically provides the appropriate<br>
signal. i.e., composite video signal to the cabie. Cable apparatus 100 can provide<br>
any one or more of the other types of cables and signals that media devices such as<br>
the iPod support, including analog audio, digital (USB) audio, component video,<br>
HDMI, DVI, S-video, etc.<br>
 <br>
[0019] Various modifications and variations to cable apparatus 100 are possible.<br>
For example, each line 140 may include one or more lines, each of which can<br>
independently carry one or more signals. In another example, cable lines 140 may<br>
include only one line that is combined with cable 130 to form a single cable.<br>
According to some embodiments, one or more additional components may be added<br>
to those noted above. Depending upon the embodiment, the specific arrangement of<br>
components may be interchanged. Further details of the various arrangements and<br>
cabling components can be found throughout the present specification below.<br>
[0020] Figure 2 illustrates a high level block diagram for connector 110 in cable<br>
apparatus 100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As<br>
discussed above, connector 110 may include a contact housing 112 and a connector<br>
boot 114. In one embodiment, connector boot 114 houses a PCB (not shown) on<br>
which various circuit components can be mounted. The circuit components can<br>
include, for example, micro-controller 210, authentication coprocessor 220, and<br>
identification wire 230 that may be electrically coupled together via circuit traces on<br>
the PCB. An example of the internal construction of connector 100 can be found in<br>
the above-referenced patent application number 11/650,330 (Attorney Docket No.<br>
20750P-002400/P4998), titled "Backward Compatible Connector System," by<br>
Murphy et al., in particular in connection with Figure 10B of that application. While<br>
these components are described as being housed inside connector 110, it is<br>
possible that parts or all of the components are distributed in other parts of cable<br>
apparatus 100. Also, these components may be integrated into a single chip or a<br>
plurality of integrated circuits.<br>
[0021] As shown in Figure 2, micro-controller 210, authentication coprocessor 220<br>
and identification wire 230 are coupled together and in combination provide the<br>
additional functionality. Micro-controller 210 can be primarily responsible for<br>
controlling communication to and from the media device vte bus 240. Authentication<br>
coprocessor 220 can be primarily responsible for implementing the authentication<br>
functionality. And identification wire 230 can be used by micro-controller 210 to<br>
detect the type of signal the cable is configured to carry (e.g., component video or<br>
composite video). A bus 250 can connect the wires from cable 130 to the contacts<br>
(or pins) in contact housing 112. There can be an optional bus 260 directly<br>
 <br>
connecting cable 130 to micro-controller 210. As used herein the term bus refers to<br>
any mechanism that electrically connects one set of contact points to another and is<br>
not limited to any specific type of electro-mechanical means.<br>
[0022] In operation, when connector 110 is connected to a media device, the media<br>
device may send an authentication inquiry to the cable. Micro-controller 210 can<br>
receive the authentication inquiry and communicate it to authentication coprocessor<br>
220. Authentication coprocessor 220 then processes the authentication request<br>
using an authentication algorithm. The authentication algorithm can be based on, for<br>
example, public key encryption using security certificates, digital signatures or other<br>
known authentication methodologies. In one embodiment, authentication techniques<br>
similar to those described in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application Number<br>
11/051,499, (Attorney Docket No. 20750P-001110/P3503US1) titled "Accessory<br>
Authentication For Electronic Devices," which is hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
its entirety, can be implemented by authentication coprocessor 220. The result of<br>
the authentication process is communicated from authentication coprocessor 220 to<br>
micro-controller 210 and from micro-controller 210 to the media device via bus 240.<br>
Upon successful authentication, the media device may proceed with further<br>
communication with the cable apparatus. While the block diagram of Figure 2 shows<br>
micro-controller 210 and authentication coprocessor 220 as two separate<br>
components, it is possible to integrate both functionalities into a single chip.<br>
[0023] Another functionality integrated in and provided by the cable apparatus<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention is cable identification.<br>
According to this embodiment, a signal such as a voltage level provided on<br>
identification wire 230 indicates a type of cable. The signal on identification wire 230<br>
can, for example, indicate whether the cable is configured to carry, e.g., composite<br>
video, component video or S-video signal. The level of the signal on identification<br>
wire 230 can be set by. for example, a resistive circuit that may be coupled either to<br>
the power supply (i.e., as a pull-up) or to ground (i.e., as a pull-down) or between<br>
both to form a voltage divider. It is also possible to not connect identification wire<br>
230 to any signal and instead use a floating condition to also indicate a type of cable.<br>
This embodiment envisions that the cable manufacturer sets the signal level on<br>
identification wire 230 simplifying the implementation of micro-controller 210. This<br>
 <br>
allows the use of a more cost-effective micro-controller 210 that can be programmed<br>
to detect the signal level on identification wire 230. In this embodiment, once micro-<br>
controller 210 determines the type of cable it is associated with, it may internally<br>
save that information in a register so that it does not have to make that determination<br>
each time it is connected to a media device. Once the cable type is identified (and in<br>
some embodiments after the cable is authenticated), micro-controller 210 can<br>
transmit a request signal to a media device to which it is connected to enable the<br>
appropriate (e.g., audio and/or video) outputs in the correct format. While in this<br>
example, the type of cable is determined based on voltage level on identification wire<br>
230, it is also possible to accomplish similar functionality with techniques other than<br>
voltage level detection, such as current sensing.<br>
[0024] In an alternative embodiment, a more sophisticated micro-controller 210 can<br>
eliminate the need for identification wire 230 and its associated circuitry by<br>
dynamically detecting the type of cable being used. According to this embodiment,<br>
micro-controller 210 can be programmed to detect the type of cable upon connection<br>
between the media device and an accessory device. Figure 3 depicts cable<br>
apparatus 100 connecting a media device 310 to one or more accessory devices<br>
320. Connector end 110 of cable apparatus 100 connects to media device 310 via<br>
contacts 112 while any one or more of connector ends 120 connect to one or more<br>
accessory devices 320.<br>
[0025] According to this embodiment, micro-controller 210 can test whether a<br>
connection is made at the accessory end via any one or more of cables 140. This<br>
can be done, for example, by micro-controller 210 applying one or more test signals<br>
to pre-determined contact pins 112 that are designated to carry specific signal types<br>
when connected by cable apparatus 100 to one or more accessory devices 320. In<br>
an alternative embodiment, micro-controller 210 can apply the test signals directly to<br>
pre-determined wires in cable 130 via bus 2(3O (see Figure 2) Rased on -he<br>
signal(s) returned to micro-controller 210 in response to the test signal(s), the micro-<br>
controller can determine how many and which connector end(s) 120 are in fact<br>
connected to an accessory. This will enable micro-controller 210 to identify the type<br>
of cable being used. For example, if only one connector end 120, such as a male<br>
RCA plug for a single composite video cable, is connected, micro-controller 210 will<br>
 <br>
identify the cable as a composite video cable. If, on the other hand, the test<br>
indicates connection of three connector ends 120 corresponding to component video<br>
signal, then micro-controller 210 identifies the cable as component video cable. It is<br>
also possible for micro-controller 210 to determine an erroneous connection (e.g.,<br>
when only one of the three component connector ends is connected) and signal<br>
media device 310 to indicate the erroneous connection on its display. Accordingly,<br>
in this embodiment, the cable type is determined by the connection it is providing<br>
and therefore can vary from one application to the next. That is, in one application<br>
wherein the cable connects a media device to, for example, a video accessory that<br>
uses composite video signals, micro-controller 210 will identify the cable type as<br>
composite video cable. The same cable when used in another application for<br>
connecting a media device to, for example, a video accessory that uses component<br>
video will be identified by micro-controller 210 as a component video.<br>
[0026] Once the type of cable is determined (and, in some embodiments, after the<br>
cable is authenticated), micro-controller 210 can transmit the cable preferences for<br>
that particular cable type to the media device. The cable preferences depend on the<br>
cable type which can be any one or more of the following: USB, Firewire, analog or<br>
digital audio, composite video, component video, S-video, HDMI, DVI and the like.<br>
For example, preferences for a composite video cable can be audio line out and<br>
composite video.<br>
[0027] In one application, cable apparatus 100 may be used to connect a media<br>
device such as an iPod to both a television set via video connector ends and a hi-fi<br>
speaker system via the audio connector ends. Cable apparatus 100 automatically<br>
performs the authentication process upon connection to media device 310. Cable<br>
apparatus 100 can also perform the cable identification process upon connection to<br>
media device 310 or upon connection to both media device 310 and accessory<br>
devices 370. Micro-controlier 210 can perform the cable dentification task before.<br>
after or in parallel with the authentication process.<br>
[0028] Figures 4, 5 and 6 illustrate various simplified methods of operation for the<br>
smart cable according to embodiments of the present invention. Method 400 shown<br>
in Figure 4 depicts one authentication method which may include process 410 for<br>
 <br>
powering up the cable circuitry upon connection to an electronic device such as a<br>
media player or an accessory. Once powered up, the cable circuitry may receive an<br>
authentication inquiry from the media device (process 420). It is also possible that<br>
the authentication inquiry sent from the media device to the cable circuitry may be<br>
prompted by the cable circuitry itself requesting to be authenticated. In response to<br>
the authentication inquiry, the cable circuitry may process the authentication inquiry<br>
and generate an authentication response (process 430). The cable circuitry may<br>
next send the authentication response back to the media device (process 440). If<br>
the authentication response is accepted by the media device (process 450), cable<br>
preferences may be transmitted to the media device (process 460) and further<br>
communication via the cable apparatus may be authorized (process 470). If the<br>
authentication process fails, the cable may be assumed to be unauthorized and no<br>
further communication via that cable may be allowed. In one embodiment, the<br>
authorization process may be retried one or more times before the cable apparatus<br>
is rejected (process 480).<br>
[0029] As discussed in connection with Figures 2 and 3, these various processes<br>
are performed, in one exemplary implementation, by the combination of micro-<br>
controller 210 and authentication coprocessor 220. That is, at process 410 upon<br>
connecting the cable to media device 320, the internal circuitry of the cable including<br>
micro-controller 210 and authentication coprocessor 220 may be powered using, for<br>
example, power supplied from media device 320 (or an accessory when connected<br>
to an accessory). After power-up, at process 420, micro-controller 210 may receive<br>
an authentication request from media device 320. At process 430, micro-controller<br>
210 then communicates with authentication coprocessor 220 to process the request<br>
in accordance with the authentication algorithm implemented by coprocessor 220.<br>
At process 440, the response generated by authentication coprocessor 220 is then<br>
sent back to media device 310 via micro-controller 210. Accordingly, this method<br>
provides for a smart cable that includes all the resources to automatically go through<br>
an authentication process upon connection to a media device.<br>
[0030] Figure 5 is a flow diagram depicting method 500 of cable identification<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. Method 500 may include<br>
process 510 for powering up the cable circuitry upon connection to an electronic<br>
 <br>
device such as a media player or an accessory, process 520 for identifying the type<br>
of cable, process 530 for generating a cable identification signal, and process 540<br>
for sending the cable identification signal to the media device. As discussed in<br>
connection with Figures 2 and 3, these various processes are performed, in one<br>
exemplary implementation, by micro-controller 210. That is, process 510 may<br>
include powering the internal circuitry of the cable including micro-controller 210 and<br>
authentication coprocessor 220 upon connecting the cable to media device 320 (or<br>
to an accessory) using, for example, power supplied from media device 320. After<br>
power-up, process 520 may include micro-controller 210 identifying the cable type.<br>
The identification of cable type by process 530 may involve micro-controller 210<br>
detecting a signal level on identification wire 230. Alternatively, micro-controller 210<br>
can detect the cable type by the configuration in which the cable is being used and<br>
the type of accessory 320 to which it is connected. Next, process 530 may include<br>
micro-controller 210 generating an identification signal and then, process 540 may<br>
include sending the identification signal to media device 310. The identification<br>
signal may include cable preferences. In response, media device 310 may use the<br>
identification signal and automatically start transmitting audio and/or video signals to<br>
the cable apparatus 100 according to preferred or required signal formats.<br>
[0031] Alternatively, media device 310 may use the identification signal and narrow<br>
its displayed menu choices (e.g., showing only the video files that are available in<br>
component format). In one example, the identification signal may instruct the media<br>
device to transmit audio signals but no video signals to the cable apparatus, and/or<br>
may also specify the type of audio signals that is preferred or required by the cable<br>
apparatus. In another example, the identification signal may instruct the media<br>
device to transmit both audio signals and video signals to the cable apparatus.<br>
Additionally, the identification signal may also specify the preferred or required type<br>
of audio signals, and/or specify the preferred or required type of video signals. For<br>
example the type of video signal may be composite, component, digital audio. S-<br>
video, HDMI, etc. In one embodiment, the type of video signals that is preferred or<br>
required by the cable apparatus may be component video signals (e.g., Y, Pb, Pr<br>
signals). Accordingly, this method provides for a smart cable that includes all the<br>
resources to automatically identify the cable type and send cable preferences to the<br>
media device upon connection to the media device.<br>
 <br>
[0032] Figure 6 is a flow diagram depicting method 600 of cable identification and<br>
authentication according to another embodiment of the present invention. Method<br>
600 essentially combines methods 400 and 500 providing for a smart cable that can<br>
automatically perform both the identification and authentication processes upon<br>
connection to a media device. Referring to Figure 6, method 600 may include<br>
process 610 for powering up the cable circuitry upon connection to a media device<br>
(or an accessory). The method may also include process 620 involving the cable<br>
circuitry identifying a cable type, and process 630 for the cable circuitry generating<br>
and transmitting a cable identification signal to the media device.<br>
[0033] Next, in response to a request from the media device to initiate the<br>
authentication process, method 600 may also include process 640 whereby the<br>
cable circuitry starts the authentication algorithm and generates an authentication<br>
response. Process 640 is followed by process 650 which may include sending the<br>
authentication response back to the media device. If the cable authentication is<br>
successful (process 660), the cable then may send its preferences to the media<br>
device (process 670) after which media content may be communicated over the<br>
cable (process 680). The cable preferences may include, for example, enabling<br>
audio and/or video line out, etc. If authentication fails, method 600 may include<br>
process 690 whereby the authentication processes (640 and 650) are repeated a<br>
predetermined number of times (n) before rejecting the cable as unauthorized. The<br>
details of operation of the authentication process and the cable identification process<br>
have been described above in connection with Figures 4 and 5 and will not be<br>
repeated. It is emphasized here, however, that each of the process flow diagrams<br>
depicts an exemplary embodiment and modifications and alternatives are possible.<br>
For example, the identification process and or the authentication process may occur<br>
with or without an inquiry from the media device. For example, in one embodiment,<br>
the process (630) whereby the cable identifies its type to the media device may<br>
include the cable also requasting to be authenticated in response to this request<br>
from the cable, the media device may send an authentication request signal to tne<br>
cable initiating the cable authentication process. Also, the various authentication<br>
processes 640 and 650 may occur before, after or concurrently with identification<br>
processes 620 and 630.<br>
 <br>
[0034] In one embodiment, the authentication processes 640 and 650 may occur<br>
first and, depending on the result of the authentication challenge, the remaining<br>
processes may proceed or may be halted. According to this embodiment, if the<br>
cable apparatus transmits the expected authentication response, media device 310<br>
may confirm thai the coupled cable apparatus is an authorized cable allowing further<br>
processes including the cable identification process to continue. If, however, no<br>
authentication response is received or if incorrect authentication response is<br>
received, the media device may be prevented from transmitting data through the<br>
attached cable apparatus, and subsequent processes cannot proceed.<br>
[0035] In all of the various embodiments described above, communication between<br>
the cable apparatus, the media device and the accessory can be based on any one<br>
of a variety of interface protocols. One example of such an interface protocol is the<br>
iPod Accessory Protocol developed by Apple Inc. that can facilitate communication<br>
between an iPod or iPhone and accessories via a smart cable apparatus according<br>
to the present invention. This particular protocol is described in greater detail in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Number 7,293,122, entitled "Connector Interface<br>
System Facilitating Communication Between a Media Player and an Accessory," to<br>
Schubert et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Also, one<br>
example of the type of connector suitable for connector 110 over which the above-<br>
referenced interface protocol can be communicated is described in the above-<br>
referenced patent application number 11/650,330 (Attorney Docket No. 20750P-<br>
002400/P4998), titled "Backward Compatible Connector System," by Murphy et al.,<br>
which in addition to the PCB inside the boot structure also describes, as shown in<br>
Figure 7, a specific number of pins (e.g., 30) and signal assignments for those pins<br>
that facilitate the protocol, all of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0036] Multiple aspects of the present invention have been described in the context<br>
of specific embodiments for illustrative purposes only. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appieciate that various alternatives, moditicanons or changes are possible the<br>
above description should therefore not be limiting of the scope of the present<br>
invention, which should instead be determined by the following claims and their full<br>
