A synthetic procedure for the preparation of 5-{4-fluorophenylj-l-[2-^ ((2R,4R)^-hydroxy-6HDXo-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-l#-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,273,995.<br>
The asymmetric reduction of fi-ketoesters, as well as ji-diketones, is a well-established transformation in organic synthesis. However, the complexity of these reactions increases in the case of 1,3,5-tricarbonyl systems and poor yields and poor stereoselectivities often result In fact, investigations by Saburi (Tetrahedron, 1997,1993;49) and Carpentier (Eur. J, Org, Chem. 1999;3421) have independently demonstrated low to moderate diastereo- and/or enantio-selectivities for diketoester asymmetric hydrogenations. Furthermore, the fact that the processes in the prior art require high pressure hydrogenation and extended reaction times makes these procedures impractical and not amenable to large-scale manufacturing processes.<br>
However, we have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the diol esters of the present invention, (R)-7-[2-(4-froorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid esters, can be obtained directly from the corresponding 1,3,5-tricarbonyl precursors in a highly stereoselective manner via a mild and efficient ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation reaction utilizing chiral non-racemic diphosphine ligands in the presence of secondary activating agents such as protic acids.<br>
-7-<br><br>
-3-<br>
The object of the present invention is a short and efficient process for the<br>
preparation of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l -[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro-<br>
pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-l//-pyrrole-3-carboxylicacid<br>
phenylamide. The present process avoids the use of a costly chiral raw material<br>
5	((R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxy-butyric acid ethyl ester), and a low temperature<br>
diastereoselective borane reduction. Furthermore, a key Paal-Knorr condensation step, common to the present and prior art processes, has been improved through a significant decrease in reaction time.<br>
Thus, the present process has significant advantages over the prior art<br>
10	processes and is amenable to large-scale synthesis.<br>

A nitrogen inerted reactor equipped with reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet<br>

10	added over ca. 15 minutes, and the solution is slowly cooled below 50°C where<br>
nucleation becomes evident. Additional MtBE (66 mL) is added over a 1-hour period. During this time, the reaction is allowed to cool to near ambient temperature.

azeotropes. The solution is cooled under a nitrogen atmosphere to ca. -5°C where<br>
a 1 M THF solution of KOtBu (90 mmol) is added in three equal portions,<br>
separated by 30 to 45 minutes. The resulting solution is allowed to stir an<br>
additional 12 to 14 hours at 0°C. The reaction is quenched by the slow addition of<br>
10	IN HC1 (100 mL). The resulting two-phase mixture is allowed to warm to ca.<br>
15°C and is transferred to a separatory funnel where the aqueous phase is removed and discarded. The organic phase is washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (25 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSC&gt;4 (5 g), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a crude<br>
oil that is taken up in MeOH (200 mL). This solution is transferred to a nitrogen<br>
15	inerted pressure reactor containing 5% Pd/C (5 g; 50% water-wet). Concentrated<br>
HC1 (2 mL) is added and the reaction is stirred under a sustained pressure of H2<br>

transferred to a nitrogen inerted reactor charged with KOH (110.0 mmol) and water (300 mL). The mixture is heated under a nitrogen atmosphere to an internal temperature of ca. 85°C. During this time, MeOH is removed via distillation. The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 45°C, where it is washed with<br>
