				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a composition and method for the<br>
removal of compounds having disagreeable odors, toxic properties or corrosive<br>
properties from gaseous streams. The invention more particularly relates to the use in<br>
filter beds of a high capacity solid filtration media containing a substrate impregnated<br>
with a permanganate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The removal of toxic, corrosive and odorous gases can be accomplished by a<br>
number of techniques. These may include wet scrubbing, incineration, and removal<br>
via gas-phase air filtration using a variety of dry scrubbing adsorptive, absorptive,<br>
and/or chemically impregnated media. As opposed to these other methods, gas-phase<br>
air filtration does not require the consumption of large quantities water or fuel. Dry-<br>
scrubbing media can be engineered from a number of common adsorbent materials<br>
with or without chemical additives for the control of a broad spectrum of gases or<br>
tailored for specific gases.<br>
In contrast to the reversible process of physical adsorption, chemical<br>
adsorption, also referred to as chemisorption, is the result of chemical reactions on the<br>
surface of the media. This process is specific and depends on the physical and<br>
chemical nature of both the media and the gases to be removed. Some oxidation<br>
reactions can occur spontaneously on the surface of the adsorbent, however, a<br>
chemical impregnant is usually added to the media. The impregnant imparts a higher<br>
contaminant removal capacity and can lend some degree of specificity. Although<br>
some selectivity is apparent in physical adsorption, it can usually be traced to purely<br>
physical, rather than chemical, properties. In chemisorption, stronger molecular<br>
forces are involved, and the process is generally instantaneous and irreversible.<br>
Undesirable airborne compounds, including sulfur compounds, such as<br>
hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide, ammonia, chlorine, formaldehyde, urea,<br>
carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercaptans, amines, isopropyl alcohol and<br>
ethylene, occur in a number of environments, where most are primarily responsible<br>
for the presence of disagreeable odors, or irritating or toxic gases. Such environments<br>
include petroleum treatment and storage areas, sewage treatment facilities, hospitals,<br>
morgues, anatomy laboratories, animal rooms, and pulp and paper production sites,<br>
among others. These undesirable compounds may be bacterial breakdown products of<br>
higher organic compounds, or simply byproducts of industrial processes.<br>
Hydrogen sulfide ("H2S"), a colorless, toxic gas with a characteristic odor of<br>
rotten eggs, is produced in coal pits, gas wells, sulfur springs, and from decaying<br>
organic matter containing sulfur. Controlling emissions of this gas, particularly from<br>
municipal sewage treatment plants, has long been considered desirable. More<br>
recently, protecting electronic apparatus from the corrosive fumes of these<br>
compounds has become increasingly important. Furthermore, H2S is flammable.<br>
Ammonia ("NH3") is also a colorless gas. It possesses a distinctive, pungent<br>
odor and is a corrosive, alkaline gas. The gas is produced in animal rooms and<br>
nurseries, and its control also has long been considered important.<br>
Chlorine ("Cl2") is a greenish-yellow gas with a suffocating odor. The<br>
compound is used for bleaching fabrics, purifying water, treating iron, and other uses.<br>
Control of this powerful irritant is necessary for the well-being of those who work<br>
with it or are otherwise exposed to it. At lower levels, in combination with moisture,<br>
chlorine has a corrosive effect on electronic circuitry, stainless steel and the like.<br>
Formaldehyde ("OCH2") is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It<br>
is present in morgues and anatomy laboratories, and because it is intensely irritating<br>
to mucous membranes, its control is necessary.<br>
Urea ("OC(NH2)2") is present in toilet exhaust and is used extensively in the<br>
paper industry to soften cellulose. Its odor makes control of this compound important.<br>
Carbon monoxide ("CO"), an odorless, colorless, toxic gas, is present in<br>
compressed breathing air. Oxygenation requirements for certain atmospheres,<br>
including those inhabited by humans, mandate its control.<br>
Oxides of nitrogen, including nitrogen dioxide ("NO2"), nitric oxide ("NO"),<br>
and nitrous oxide ("N2O"), are compounds with differing characteristics and levels of<br>
danger to humans, with nitrous oxide being the least irritating oxide. Nitrogen<br>
dioxide, however, is a deadly poison. Control of pollution resulting from any of these<br>
oxides is desirable or necessary, depending on the oxide.<br>
Mercaptans and amines, including methyl mercaptan ("CH3SH"), butyl<br>
mercaptan ("C4H9SH") and methyl amine ("CH3NH2"), are undesirable gases present<br>
in sewerage odor. The control of these gases is desired for odor control.<br>
Isopropyl alcohol ("(CH3)2CH0H") is a flammable liquid and vapor.<br>
Inhalation of the vapor is known to irritate the respiratory tract. Furthermore,<br>
exposure to high concentrations of isopropyl alcohol can have a narcotic effect,<br>
producing symptoms of dizziness, drowsiness, headache, staggering, unconsciousness<br>
and possibly death. The control of this vapor in print processing and industrial<br>
synthesis is desired.<br>
Ethylene ("C2H4") is a colorless, flammable gas. It is a simple asphyxiant that<br>
accelerates the maturation or decomposition of fruits, vegetables, and flowers.<br>
Control of this compound prolongs the marketable life of such items.<br>
The airborne compounds described above can have a detrimental effect on the<br>
local environment. For example, acidification is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide<br>
and nitrogen compounds (nitrogen oxides and ammonia), which in turn cause acid<br>
rain. Furthermore, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from vehicular<br>
traffic, electricity and heat production, as well as from industrial facilities may, under<br>
certain conditions, contribute to the formation of photochemical oxidants, among<br>
which ozone is the dominating substance. Ozone is a colorless gas that forms when<br>
nitrogen oxides mix with hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight. In addition to<br>
causing environmental damage, ozone poses a health hazard, particularly for children,<br>
the elderly and individuals with asthma or lung disease.<br>
Attempts have been made to provide solid filtration media for removing the<br>
undesirable compounds described above from fluid, or moving, streams, such as gas<br>
or vapor streams. Desired features of such media are a high total capacity for the<br>
removal of the targeted compound so that the media lasts longer and need not be<br>
replaced frequently, a high efficiency in removing the compound from an air stream<br>
contacting the media so that the compound is removed quickly, and a high ignition<br>
temperature (non-flammability). High capacity and high efficiency are, in turn,<br>
directly affected by the porosity and pore structure of the solid filtration media, while<br>
the capacity, efficiency and ignition temperature are all affected by the specific<br>
composition of the media.<br>
Although a variety of permanganate-impregnated substrates are known for<br>
removing undesirable contaminants from fluid streams, these known impregnated<br>
substrates all demonstrate a limited capacity and, therefore, a low efficiency for the<br>
removal of undesirable compounds from the streams. These limitations arise to a<br>
large extent from an insufficient porosity of the solid filtration media or a clogging of<br>
pores with byproducts formed by reactions of the impregnate with the contaminant.<br>
This results in the currently available media not meeting the needs of various<br>
industries.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a high efficiency, high capacity, low flammability<br>
permanganate-impregnated substrate for the removal of undesirable compounds from<br>
gas streams. Such an impregnated substrate needs to be long-lasting, requiring fewer<br>
replacements and thereby minimizing replacement and maintenance costs. Also<br>
needed is a high capacity impregnated substrate that may be used in small filter beds,<br>
and therefore may allow the treatment of fluid streams where there are significant<br>
space limitations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
High capacity solid filtration media, methods of preparing the same and<br>
methods of treating a fluid stream with the solid filtration media are provided. The<br>
solid filtration media described herein are useful for removing or reducing<br>
undesirable contaminants from a gaseous fluid stream.<br>
Generally described, the high capacity solid filtration media include a porous,<br>
impregnated substrate having high levels of impregnate. The impregnate is a<br>
permanganate, preferably a permanganate salt having high water solubility, such as<br>
sodium permanganate or lithium permanganate. A gas-evolving or gas-producing<br>
material such as sodium bicarbonate may also be included in the media. In contrast to<br>
presently available filtration media, the high capacity solid filtration media described<br>
herein contain levels of permanganate approximately 8% or higher, thereby providing<br>
an increased efficiency for removing undesirable gaseous compounds from a fluid<br>
stream, particularly compounds such as ethylene, formaldehyde and methyl<br>
mercaptan from gaseous streams by exhibiting a higher capacity for contaminant. For<br>
example, when used to remove ethylene from a gaseous stream, the media described<br>
herein utilizing sodium permanganate have an ethylene capacity of approximately<br>
9%, whereas currently available potassium permanganate-impregnated media exhibit<br>
a maximum ethylene capacity of only approximately 3%.<br>
The present invention addresses an existing need in the industry by providing a<br>
high capacity, low fiammability permanganate-impregnated substrate for the removal<br>
of undesirable contaminants from gas streams. The permanganate-impregnated<br>
substrate provides a long lasting filtration media that can be replaced less frequently,<br>
thereby minimizing maintenance and replacement costs. Due to its high capacity, the<br>
impregnated substrate described herein may be used in small filter beds, thereby<br>
allowing the treatment of fluid streams where significant space limitations exist. The<br>
filtration media described herein yield an equivalent or superior capacity over<br>
activated carbon adsorbents and are much less expensive and considerably less<br>
flammable than activated carbon adsorbents.<br>
Generally described, the filtration media contain at least approximately 8% by<br>
weight of media composition of a permanganate, wherein the permanganate has a<br>
higher solubility in water than that of potassium permanganate, and a porous<br>
substrate, wherein the permanganate impregnates the porous substrate. The<br>
permanganate and the substrate. In yet another aspect, an aqueous solution containing<br>
the permanganate is sprayed onto a dry mixture containing the permanganate and the<br>
substrate. Optionally, sodium bicarbonate may be added either to the dry mixture, to<br>
the water, or to both in the method of preparing the filtration media.<br>
Preferably, the unit formed as described above is cured until the concentration<br>
of water is from about 5 to about 25% by weight of the composition, and the<br>
concentration of the permanganate is from about 8 to about 25% by weight of the<br>
composition. Preferably, where sodium bicarbonate has been added to the<br>
composition, the unit formed is cured until the concentration of sodium bicarbonate is<br>
between 15 to 20% by weight. More preferably, the unit is cured until the<br>
concentration of the permanganate is from about 15 to about 20% by weight of the<br>
composition. Most preferably, the unit is cured until the concentration of the<br>
permanganate is from about 18 to about 19% by weight of the composition.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of treating a<br>
contaminated fluid stream with the high capacity solid filtration media described<br>
herein. This method comprises contacting the contaminated fluid stream with the<br>
solid filtration media to remove contaminant.<br>
The high capacity filtration media, the method of preparation, and the method<br>
of use provide improved efficiency and capacity in removing contaminants,<br>
particularly odor-causing contaminants, from gas streams.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a high capacity<br>
solid filtration media that efficiently removes undesirable compounds from an air<br>
stream to reduce odors, minimize the corrosion of metals or electronics, and to<br>
provide a nontoxic or nonirritating breathing environment for humans and animals.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a high capacity solid<br>
filtration media that is long-lasting and requires minimal maintenance or replacement.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a solid filtration<br>
media having a high ignition temperature, and therefore, limited flammability.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved solid<br>
filtration media that is inexpensive to manufacture and use.<br>
composition typically also contains at least approximately 5% water by weight of<br>
media composition. Preferably, the permanganate is a highly water soluble<br>
permanganate salt such as sodium permanganate or lithium permanganate. The<br>
porous substrate is typically selected from, but not limited to, activated alumina, silica<br>
gel, a zeolite, adsorbent clay, kaolin, activated bauxite, or combinations thereof, the<br>
preferred porous substrate being alumina or an alumina-zeolite mix.<br>
Preferred solid filtration media contain from approximately 8 to approximately<br>
25% permanganate, between approximately 5 and 25% water, and a porous substrate.<br>
More preferred solid filtration media contain from approximately 15 to approximately<br>
20% permanganate, between approximately 5 and 25% water, and a porous substrate.<br>
Most preferably, the solid filtration media contain from approximately 18 to<br>
approximately 19% permanganate, between approximately 5 and 25% water, and a<br>
porous substrate. All of the above percentages are by weight of the entire composition<br>
and, as described above, the permanganate has a higher solubility in water than that of<br>
potassium permanganate.<br>
In another embodiment, the media further contain a gas-evolving material,<br>
such as a carbonate compound, a bicarbonate compound, or a combination thereof,<br>
that function by producing a gas (typically CO2) upon heating. For example, when<br>
the composition further contains sodium bicarbonate, the sodium bicarbonate is<br>
present between approximately 5 to 25%, and preferably is between about 15 to 20%<br>
by weight of the entire composition.<br>
The high capacity solid filtration media composition described above are<br>
produced by mixing water, a permanganate, and a substrate, and then forming the<br>
mixture into at least one cohesive porous unit. The unit is then cured at a temperature<br>
of from about 100°F to about 200°F, until the concentration of water is at least about<br>
5% by weight of the composition, and the concentration of the permanganate is at<br>
least about 8% by weight of the composition.<br>
In accordance with a preferred method of making the solid filtration media, an<br>
aqueous solution containing the permanganate is sprayed onto the porous substrate. In<br>
an alternative aspect, water is combined with a dry mixture containing the<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a solid filtration media<br>
having such a high capacity for removing undesirable compounds that less media<br>
needs to be utilized, therefore allowing the use of smaller air filtration units.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a simple,<br>
inexpensive method of making an improved solid filtration media having a high<br>
efficiency and a high total capacity for the removal of an undesirable compound.<br>
It is a further object to provide a rapid, efficient and inexpensive method of<br>
treating a contaminated air or gas stream with a solid filtration media.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed<br>
embodiments and the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
High capacity solid filtration media, methods of preparing the same, and<br>
methods of treating a fluid stream with the solid filtration media are provided. The<br>
solid filtration media can be used to remove or reduce undesirable compounds, or<br>
contaminants, from a gaseous fluid stream. The solid filtration media contain<br>
permanganate and a porous substrate. Typically, the media also contain water. A gas-<br>
evolving material such as sodium bicarbonate may also be included. In some<br>
embodiments, at least one zeolite is optionally included in the media. The media<br>
contain significantly higher levels of permanganate than previously believed to be<br>
possible.<br>
Generally described, the filtration media contain a substrate impregnated with<br>
high levels of permanganate. The permanganate is a highly water soluble<br>
permanganate having a solubility in water greater than that of potassium<br>
permanganate. The filtration media include at least about 8% permanganate by weight<br>
of the composition. The permanganate is preferably a permanganate salt such as, but<br>
not limited to, sodium permanganate ("NaMnO4"), magnesium permanganate<br>
("Mg(MnO4)2"), calcium permanganate ("Ca(MnO4)2"), barium permanganate<br>
("Ba(MnO4)2"), and lithium permanganate ("LiMnO4"). More preferably, the<br>
permanganate salt is sodium permanganate (commercially available from chemical<br>
suppliers such as Cams Chemical Co., Peru, IL) or lithium permanganate. Most<br>
preferably, the permanganate is sodium permanganate due to its inexpensive<br>
commercial availability. The concentration of the permanganate in the media is<br>
typically from about 8 to about 25%, more preferably from approximately 15 to<br>
approximately 20%, and most preferably from approximately 18 to approximately<br>
19%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The porous substrate may be selected from the group consisting of, but not<br>
limited to, activated alumina (Al2O3) (UOP Chemical, Baton Rouge, Louisiana), silica<br>
gels (J. M. Huber, Chemical Division, Havre De Grace, Maryland), zeolites (Steel<br>
Head Specialty Minerals, Spokane, Washington), kaolin (Englehard Corp., Edison,<br>
New Jersey), adsorbent clays (Englehard Corp., Edison, New Jersey), and activated<br>
bauxite. A preferred porous substrate is alumina. Preferably, the concentration of<br>
substrate in the filtration media is from about 40 to 80%, and most preferably is from<br>
about 60 to 75% in the absence of sodium bicarbonate and from about 40 to 60% if<br>
the media contain sodium bicarbonate.<br>
Another preferred porous substrate is a combination of alumina and a zeolite,<br>
in which up to about 50% by weight of the porous substrate combination is a zeolite.<br>
Though not intending to be bound by this statement, it is believed that zeolites further<br>
control the moisture content of the filtration media by attracting and holding water,<br>
which functions to keep more of the impregnate in solution. This effect, in turn, is<br>
believed to enhance the high capacity and improved efficiency of the filtration media.<br>
As used herein, the term zeolite includes natural silicate zeolites, synthetic materials<br>
and phosphate minerals that have a zeolite-like structure. Examples of zeolites that<br>
can be used in this media include, but are not limited to, amicite (hydrated potassium<br>
sodium aluminum silicate), analcime (hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), pollucite<br>
(hydrated cesium sodium aluminum silicate), boggsite (hydrated calcium sodium<br>
aluminum silicate), chabazite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), edingtonite<br>
(hydrated barium calcium aluminum silicate), faujasite (hydrated sodium calcium<br>
magnesium aluminum silicate), ferrierite (hydrated sodium potassium magnesium<br>
calcium aluminum silicate), gobbinsite (hydrated sodium potassium calcium<br>
aluminum silicate), harmotome (hydrated barium potassium aluminum silicate),<br>
phillipsite (hydrated potassium sodium calcium aluminum silicate), clinoptilolite<br>
(hydrated sodium potassium calcium aluminum silicate), mordenite (hydrated sodium<br>
potassium calcium aluminum silicate), mesolite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum<br>
silicate), natrolite (hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), amicite (hydrated potassium<br>
sodium aluminum silicate), garronite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), perlialite<br>
(hydrated potassium sodium calcium strontium aluminum silicate), barrerite (hydrated<br>
sodium potassium calcium aluminum silicate), stilbite (hydrated sodium calcium<br>
aluminum silicate), thomsonite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), and the<br>
like. Zeolites have many related phosphate and silicate minerals with cage-like<br>
framework structures or with similar properties as zeolites, which may also be used in<br>
place of, or along with, zeolites. These zeolite-like minerals include minerals such as<br>
kehoeite, pahasapaite, tiptopite, hsianghualite, lovdarite, viseite, partheite, prehnite,<br>
roggianite, apophyllite, gyrolite, maricopaite, okenite, tacharanite, tobermorite, and<br>
the like.<br>
The concentration of water in the filtration media is typically at least<br>
approximately 5 to 25%, preferably from approximately 10 to 25%. One of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will understand that the concentration of free water in the filtration<br>
media may be altered by the conditions present, such as the humidity and the<br>
temperature, during its storage and use.<br>
Preferably, the solid filtration media includes from approximately 8 to 25%<br>
permanganate, from about 5 to 25% water, and from approximately 40 to 80%<br>
substrate, by weight of the composition. More preferably, the media contain from<br>
approximately 15 to 20% permanganate, from approximately 5 to 25% water, and<br>
from approximately 40 to 80% substrate, by weight. Most preferably, the solid<br>
filtration media contain from approximately 18 to 19% permanganate, from<br>
approximately 10 to 25% water, and from approximately 40 to 60% substrate, by<br>
weight. As described above, the permanganate is ideally sodium permanganate due to<br>
its high solubility in water and inexpensive commercial availability.<br>
The gas-evolving material of the filtration media described herein is a material<br>
that produces or releases a gaseous substance upon heating, for example during the<br>
curing step of forming the filtration media. The bubbles formed in this heating<br>
process are instrumental in enhancing and controlling the pore structure of the<br>
filtration media. The gas-evolving material is usually selected from a carbonate<br>
compound, a bicarbonate compound, or a combination thereof, that functions by<br>
producing carbon dioxide gas upon heating. A preferred gas-evolving material is<br>
sodium bicarbonate, because of its smooth release of carbon dioxide, and its relatively<br>
low cost. However, other bicarbonates and carbonates can be used in this media, the<br>
selection of which is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The number and<br>
size of the pores produced from heating the gas-evolving material is related to the<br>
concentration of the gas-evolving material in the solid filtration media, the<br>
temperature of curing, and the time of curing. Thus, increasing the concentration of<br>
sodium bicarbonate in the composition increases the pore size and number, helps<br>
reduce and prevent clogging of the pore structure, enhances the retention of water,<br>
and sustains the concentration of the permanganate in the filtration media.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the filtration media composition includes a<br>
permanganate, water, a substrate and sodium bicarbonate ("NaHCO3") (Rhone-<br>
Poulenc, Chicago Heights, IL), wherein the concentration of sodium bicarbonate is<br>
from approximately 5 to 25%, and preferably from 15 to 20%, by weight. In the<br>
embodiments where the filtration media contain sodium bicarbonate, the preferred<br>
concentration of alumina is from approximately 40 to 60%.<br>
It is to be understood that, when referring to the relative weight of<br>
components, the water referred to in the present specification, examples, and tables is<br>
defined as the free water, and does not include the bound water in the substrate. Free<br>
water is driven off by an oven at approximately 200°F, but if left in the substrate it is<br>
available for the oxidation reaction. In contrast, bound water is not driven out or<br>
evaporated except by a kiln at about 1800 to 2000°F, and the bound water functions<br>
by holding the substrate together. Bound water is not available for reaction with the<br>
undesirable contaminants.<br>
It is also to be understood that the term permanganate as used quantitatively in<br>
the present specification, examples, and tables represents the permanganate salt, not<br>
the permanganate ion, MnO4". Therefore, the percent ranges of permanganates in<br>
compositions in the present specification denote the percent of the permanganate salt<br>
in the composition, not the percent of the permanganate ion in the composition.<br>
Terms such as "filtration media", "adsorbent composition," "chemisorbent<br>
composition," and "impregnated substrate" are all interchangeable, and denote a<br>
substance that is capable of reducing or eliminating the presence of unwanted<br>
contaminants in fluid streams by the contact of such a substance with the fluid stream.<br>
It is to be understood that the term "fluid" is defined as a liquid or gas capable of<br>
flowing, or moving in a particular direction, and includes gaseous, aqueous, organic<br>
containing, and inorganic containing fluids.<br>
Solid Filtration Media Preparation Methods<br>
Also provided is a method of preparing high capacity solid filtration media.<br>
The method includes mixing water, a permanganate, an optional gas-evolving<br>
material, and a porous substrate, and then forming the mixture into at least one<br>
cohesive porous unit. The unit is then typically cured at a temperature of from about<br>
100°F to about 200°F, until the concentration of water is at least about 5% by weight<br>
of the composition, and the concentration of the permanganate is at least about 8% by<br>
weight of the composition. The size and shape of the cohesive porous unit is not<br>
critical. Any size and shape of a porous unit known in the art to reduce or eliminate<br>
undesirable contaminants from fluid streams when in contact with the unit may be<br>
used. Preferably, the porous unit is a nominal 1/8" diameter round pellet.<br>
The method provided herein preferably includes forming an aqueous solution<br>
containing the permanganate and optional gas-evolving material and then mixing the<br>
aqueous permanganate solution with the porous substrate. To dissolve and maintain<br>
the permanganate in solution, the aqueous solution should be heated to approximately<br>
160° to 200°F, and preferably to approximately 180° to 190°F.<br>
In another embodiment, the method includes forming a dry mixture containing<br>
the permanganate and the porous substrate, and then adding water to the dry mixture.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method includes forming a dry mixture containing the<br>
permanganate, the optional gas-evolving material, and the porous substrate; forming a<br>
separate aqueous solution containing the permanganate and the optional gas-evolving<br>
material, and then mixing the aqueous solution with the dry mixture. Optionally, the<br>
gas-evolving material such as sodium bicarbonate may be added either to the dry<br>
mixture, to the water, or to both in the above methods of preparing the filtration<br>
media.<br>
Preferably, the unit formed is cured until the concentration of water is from<br>
about 5 to about 25%, most preferably from about 10 to about 25% by weight of the<br>
composition; the concentration of the permanganate is at least about 8 to about 25%<br>
by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 15 to about 20%, and most<br>
preferably from about 18 to about 19%; and the concentration of the gas-evolving<br>
material is from about 5 to about 25% by weight of the composition, most preferably<br>
from about 15 to 20% by weight of the composition, after curing. The presence of a<br>
gas-evolving material such as sodium bicarbonate allows for a lower curing<br>
temperature, such as about 130° to 140°F, in contrast to the conventional curing<br>
temperature of about 200°F.<br>
The impregnation treatment of the activated starting material in accordance<br>
with the present method has not been found to be critical with respect to the particular<br>
sequence in which the dry mix is impregnated with moisture and impregnates. The<br>
above combinations may be mixed in any manner which effectively produces the<br>
desired filtration media. Impregnation may be carried out simply by immersing and<br>
soaking the solid combination in a volume of impregnate solution. Also, the<br>
impregnate solution may be passed through the combination rather than being used as<br>
a static immersion treatment. However, it has been found that a preferred method of<br>
impregnation is spray addition in which an impregnate solution is sprayed onto a dry<br>
combination being tumbled in a mixer. This method of impregnation has been<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,226,332, which is herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. Other methods of impregnating the combinations will suggest themselves as<br>
equally appropriate, and these are included within the scope of the present method.<br>
In one embodiment utilizing the above spray addition method, the aqueous<br>
impregnate solution of permanganate is sprayed onto a dry combination of gas-<br>
evolving material, such as sodium bicarbonate, and a porous substrate, such as<br>
activated alumina. For example, the dry combination preferably contains between<br>
approximately 80 to 85% activated alumina and between approximately 15 to 20% of<br>
sodium bicarbonate.<br>
The concentration of the permanganate may vary in the solution to be sprayed<br>
onto the dry combination. For example, to produce a solid filtration medium<br>
containing approximately 20% permanganate, an aqueous solution containing<br>
approximately 40% of permanganate, at between approximately 160°F to 200°F, and<br>
preferably at about 180°F to 190°F should be sprayed on the dry combination of gas-<br>
evolving material and porous substrate being tumbled in a mixer. Also, to produce a<br>
solid filtration medium containing approximately 8-9% permanganate, a solution of<br>
approximately 18% permanganate at between approximately 160°F to 200°F, and<br>
preferably at about 180°F to 190°F should be sprayed on the dry combination of gas-<br>
evolving material and porous substrate being tumbled in a mixer. Any concentration<br>
of permanganate in the aqueous solution which is effective to yield the composition<br>
described herein may be used. Further, where the permanganate is either in the dry<br>
feed mixture or in both the aqueous solution and the dry feed mixture, any<br>
concentration of permanganate in the dry mixture and/or the aqueous solution which<br>
is effective to produce the composition described herein may be used. For example,<br>
the media may be used to fill perforated modules to be inserted into air ducts in a<br>
manner known in the art.<br>
Contaminant Removal Methods<br>
Also provided is a method of treating a contaminated fluid stream using the<br>
high capacity solid filtration media described herein or produced by the process<br>
described above. This method involves contacting the contaminated fluid stream with<br>
the solid filtration composition provided herein. Typically, the undesired<br>
contaminants will be removed from air, especially from air admixed with effluent gas<br>
streams resulting from municipal waste treatment facilities, paper mills,<br>
petrochemical refining plants, morgues, hospitals, anatomy laboratories, and hotel<br>
facilities, and so forth. Methods of treating gaseous or other fluid streams are well<br>
known in the art. As the method of treating fluid streams is not critical to the present<br>
invention, any method known in the art of treating fluid streams with the media<br>
described herein may be used.<br>
The composition described herein is useful for removing undesired<br>
contaminants from gaseous streams. Undesirable airborne compounds to be removed<br>
using the high capacity filtration media include, but are not limited to, sulfur<br>
compounds (such as hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide), ammonia, chlorine,<br>
formaldehyde, urea, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercaptans (such as<br>
methyl mercaptan), amines, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene. Typically, contaminants<br>
to be removed by employing the media described herein include, but are not limited<br>
to, ethylene, formaldehyde and methyl mercaptan The concentrations of undesirable<br>
contaminants in the gaseous streams is not considered critical to the process of<br>
contaminant removal, nor is the physical and chemical makeup of the gas stream<br>
considered critical. Even concentrations of these undesirable compounds in gas<br>
streams resulting in levels lower than one ppb of the compounds passing through a<br>
solid filtration media bed per minute may be removed.<br>
However, it has been found that flow rates of the gas stream being contacted<br>
with the bed of filtration media affect the breakthrough capacities of the media. The<br>
preferred flow rate is between 10 and 750 ft/min, and most preferably is between 60<br>
and 100 ft/min, flowing perpendicularly to the face of the bed.<br>
While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that<br>
it may be necessary that certain oxidizing conditions prevail while using the solid<br>
filtration media described herein. The extent of oxidation may affect the degree of<br>
purification achieved. Preferably, oxygen is present in the gas stream being treated, at<br>
least in small amounts. This oxygen content is readily found in the gas stream, if air<br>
constitutes a sufficient portion of the gas stream being treated. If oxygen is totally<br>
absent or present in insufficient amounts, oxygen may be independently introduced<br>
into the gas stream being treated. A number of factors affect the amount of oxygen,<br>
which may be required for maximum removal of the contaminants in a gas stream in<br>
accordance with the present method, including the concentration and absolute amount<br>
of compounds being removed from the gas stream being treated.<br>
With respect to the amount of compound removed, it is believed that the<br>
following factors affect the process: the basic degree of attraction of the activated<br>
substrate for the compound; the pore structure and pore size distribution; the size of<br>
the substrate; the specific surface area of the substrate as affected by the number and<br>
size of pores; the surface characteristics of the substrate; the amount of permanganate<br>
present; the amount of gas-evolving material present in the composition, which<br>
affects the number, size, and perhaps structure of pores; and the amount of water<br>
present.<br>
The filtration media provided herein is appropriately used alone in filter beds<br>
for the removal of undesirable compounds. It is also appropriate, however, to use the<br>
composition in conjunction with filter beds containing other filtration media, and also<br>
in conjunction with mechanical or electrostatic filters. Any such additional filters<br>
may be placed either upstream (before the media described herein with respect to the<br>
effluent gas being treated) or downstream.<br>
The above invention significantly increases the efficiency and capacity of<br>
impregnated porous substrates (filtration media) to remove certain undesired<br>
compounds from gaseous streams over the capacity of impregnated substrates<br>
currently available. Therefore, the lifetime of a specific quantity of the high capacity<br>
filtration media will be much longer than the same quantity of the currently available<br>
filtration media.<br>
The extension of the lifetime of the filtration products will significantly reduce<br>
the purchasing, servicing, and installation costs of consumers and businesses. Also,<br>
the enhanced efficiency of the media allows for a new line of products, which are<br>
compact versions of currently available units, but have the same performance as the<br>
larger, currently available units. The capability of creating significantly smaller<br>
filtration units is useful for providing efficacious air filtration in space-limited<br>
quarters, which previously could not utilize the larger, currently available units.<br>
Also, the filtration media described herein is less expensive than other<br>
filtration media having a roughly equivalent capacity. For example, the media of the<br>
present invention has a capacity equivalent or superior to the contaminant capacity of<br>
activated carbon adsorbents, particularly in respect to ethylene and formaldehyde<br>
contaminants. However, the media provided herein is considerably less expensive<br>
than activated carbon adsorbents.<br>
Further, the filtration media provided herein is safe as it is not flammable, in<br>
contrast to carbon-containing filtration products. This characteristic of the presently<br>
provided filtration media is significant to industries that manufacture or process<br>
flammable, fume producing materials, such as the petroleum industry for example.<br>
In the high capacity filtration media described herein, the use of a highly water<br>
soluble permanganate, having a water solubility higher than that of potassium<br>
permanganate, allows for an increase in the concentration of permanganate in the<br>
media. This increased concentration of permanganate greatly increases the removal<br>
capacity of the media for contaminants. When performing accelerated capacity tests<br>
as described in the examples below, the filtration media is examined at 100%<br>
efficiency until the efficiency drops to a pre-determined level, in this case 99.5%<br>
efficiency. Once this breakthrough is achieved the test is complete, and removal<br>
capacity can then be calculated. The capacity level is inherently linked to efficiency,<br>
because it is determined in association with the time taken for the efficiency to drop<br>
to 99.5%. Currently available potassium permanganate impregnated alumina media<br>
has a capacity of approximately 3% for the removal of ethylene. In contrast, the high<br>
capacity filtration media described herein containing approximately 60% activated<br>
alumina, approximately 15-20% water, and 19-20% sodium permanganate, exhibited<br>
an ethylene capacity of approximately 9%. Capacity tests were performed by<br>
challenging a known quantity of the selected solid filtration media with 1.0% (by<br>
volume) ethylene gas at a constant flow rate and monitoring the concentration of<br>
ethylene in the gas stream exiting the solid filtration media. The accelerated removal<br>
capacity test is fully described in U.S. Patent No. 6,004,522, which is herein<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The high capacity of the solid filtration media described herein is not limited<br>
to the removal of ethylene from a gaseous stream. Indeed, high capacity is similarly<br>
achieved for other gaseous contaminant such as hydrogen sulfide, formaldehyde and<br>
methyl mercaptan. The results of these investigations are presented in the Examples,<br>
below.<br>
Although the precise mechanisms by which the high capacity media operates<br>
are not understood or fully appreciated, and its scope is not bound by the following<br>
theory, it is believed that the oxidation reactions between the permanganate and the<br>
undesirable contaminants occur primarily near the surface of the filtration media,<br>
rather than deep within its pores. Therefore the media most likely perform at optimal<br>
levels when the oxidative capabilities of the surface are continually regenerated. It is<br>
believed that the oxidative capability of the surface of the media is regenerated by the<br>
flow or migration of permanganate from the center of the media to the surface of the<br>
media while the products of the oxidation reactions flow or migrate from the surface<br>
of the media to the center of the media. It is also believed that the higher the<br>
concentration of permanganate at the surface of the media, the higher the capacity and<br>
efficiency of the media.<br>
Furthermore, the fluidity of the permanganate solution directly affects the flow<br>
and thus the quantity of the permanganate reaching the surface of the media.<br>
Therefore, the media work well when an elevated concentration of free water is<br>
maintained in the media so that the permanganate solution maintains a high level of<br>
fluidity and readily flows to the surface of the media thereby maximizing the<br>
efficiency and capacity of the media. A liquid path thus should be established<br>
between the interior of the pores and the surface of the media. In this regard, the<br>
improved pore structure provided by the addition of a gas-evolving material to the<br>
filtration media is believed to enhance the ready flow of permanganate solution. This<br>
is contrary to conventional theories, which teach a need for penetration of the gaseous<br>
contaminants into the pores of the substrate.<br>
This theory, presented above, explains why the capacity and efficiency of the<br>
traditional filtration media could not surpass the capacity and efficiency obtained at<br>
the potassium permanganate concentrations of 4-5%. As stated above, previously,<br>
various attempts were made to impregnate the media with higher quantities of<br>
potassium permanganate, however, the majority of the free water has always been<br>
removed from these media. The efficiency and capacity of these highly impregnated<br>
potassium permanganate media remained constant or decreased relative to the<br>
capacity achieved by media impregnated with 4-5% permanganate. There are three<br>
reasons for the failure of the highly impregnated media currently available to obtain<br>
higher results. First, the high concentration of permanganate and the low<br>
concentration of water causes the permanganate to crystallize and clog the pores of<br>
the substrate thereby blocking the flow of permanganate to the surface of the media.<br>
Second, the crystallized permanganate remains in the center of the media and<br>
therefore cannot move to the surface of the media to oxidize contaminants. Third, it is<br>
difficult for any permanganate that may be in solution to move to the surface of the<br>
media as the permanganate solution is very concentrated and has a low level of<br>
fluidity. It is for these reasons that maintaining an elevated level of water in the media<br>
is believed to be useful for improved filtration media, and is included in the present<br>
invention. It is also believed that the unprecedented improvement in solid filtration<br>
media of this invention is due to recent advances in the preparation and supply of<br>
commercially available permanganates. Historically these permanganates are supplied<br>
either as granular crystals or relatively low aqueous concentrations. Potassium<br>
permanganate is known to crystallize in high concentration, as frequently<br>
demonstrated in the literature. Concentrated aqueous potassium permanganate (20%)<br>
can also precipitate during curing, and ultimately clog the pores of filtration media.<br>
However, a permanganate having a water solubility greater than that of potassium<br>
permanganate, such as sodium permanganate, is miscible in water in all proportions<br>
(by comparison, potassium permanganate solubility is approximately 6.5g/100ml by<br>
weight, at 20°C). Due in part to the important difference in solubility, it is now<br>
possible to incorporate substantially higher concentrations (&gt;20%) of permanganates,<br>
such as sodium permanganate, than previously obtained, ultimately yielding an<br>
increased removal capacity of contaminates from gaseous streams. Furthermore, the<br>
significant increase in removal capacity of ethylene contaminants is due in part to the<br>
increased concentration of permanganate, but also due to the formation of relatively<br>
small non-volatile waste products (CO2 and H2O) which are released from the solid<br>
filtration media, effectively providing additional active surface area for multiple<br>
reactions with other gaseous contaminants.<br>
The following examples will serve better to illustrate the high capacity of the<br>
solid filtration media described herein for the removal of contaminants in gas streams.<br>
It should be noted that the continuous flow systems described in several of the<br>
following examples all were operated at a relative humidity of 40-50%.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of Filtration Media Containing 13% Sodium Permanganate<br>
A sodium permanganate impregnated alumina composition is prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
A dried feed mix is prepared by combining, by weight, 80-85% alumina, and<br>
15-20% sodium bicarbonate. The dry feed mixture is sprayed with a heated aqueous<br>
sodium permanganate solution at 180 to 190°F while being tumbled in a tumble mill.<br>
The resulting pellets are dried at 130 to 140°F until the pellets contain about 20 to<br>
25%o free water.<br>
To prepare solid filtration media containing approximately 13% sodium<br>
permanganate by dry weight, the aqueous sodium permanganate solution preferably<br>
contains approximately 26% sodium permanganate by weight. It is to be understood<br>
that the aqueous sodium permanganate solution is sprayed onto the dry feed while the<br>
dry mix is rolled in the pelletizing disk as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,226,332,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of Filtration Media Containing; 4-5% Potassium Permanganate<br>
A 4-5% potassium permanganate impregnated alumina composition was<br>
prepared as follows.<br>
A dry feed mix, consisting of 100% alumina, was sprayed with a heated<br>
aqueous potassium permanganate solution at 180 to 190°F while the dried feed was<br>
tumbled in a tumble mill. The resulting pellets were then dried at 130 to 140°F until<br>
the pellets contained about 20 to 25% free water.<br>
To prepare solid filtration media containing approximately 4-5% potassium<br>
permanganate by dry weight, the aqueous potassium permanganate solution<br>
preferably contained approximately 10% potassium permanganate by weight. It is to<br>
be understood that the aqueous potassium permanganate solution was sprayed onto<br>
the dry feed while the dry mix was rolled in the pelletizing disk as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,226,332.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of Filtration Media Containing 19-20% Sodium Permanganate<br>
A 19-20% sodium permanganate impregnated alumina composition was<br>
prepared as follows.<br>
A dried feed mix, consisting of 100% alumina, was sprayed with a heated<br>
aqueous sodium permanganate solution at 180 to 190°F while the dried feed was<br>
being tumbled in a tumble mill. The resulting pellets were then dried at 130 to 140°F<br>
in air until the pellets contained about 20 to 25% free water.<br>
To prepare a solid filtration media containing approximately 19-20% sodium<br>
permanganate, by dry weight, the aqueous solution preferably contained<br>
approximately 40% sodium permanganate, by weight. It is to be understood that the<br>
aqueous potassium permanganate solution was sprayed on to the dry feed while the<br>
dry feed was rolled in the pelletizing disk as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,226,332.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of Additional Permanganate-Impregnated Substrates<br>
Using the methods described in Examples 2 and 3, above, the following<br>
compositions, by dry weight, were also prepared.<br><br>
The dry feed mix, consisting of 100% alumina, was mixed in a tumbling mill<br>
and sprayed with the appropriate amount of aqueous potassium permanganate or<br>
aqueous sodium permanganate solution, while tumbling, in the manner described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,226,332. Curing was carried out as in Examples 2 or 3 to provide<br>
the cured pellets as a strong, non-dusting filter media suitable for placement in filter<br>
beds.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Standard Accelerated Test Method for Capacity Determination of Gas-Phase Air<br>
Filtration Media.<br>
The following accelerated test method is useful for determining the capacity of<br>
removal of various gas-phase air filtration media when subjected to a flowing gas<br>
stream containing high levels of contaminant(s). Low-level challenge testing of gas-<br>
phase air filtration media, whether full-scale or small-scale, usually takes long periods<br>
of time to obtain the desired results. The following method provides an accelerated<br>
test for determining the removal capacities of various media by exposing them to high<br>
levels of contaminants.<br>
The method is briefly summarized as follows: a known volume of media is<br>
placed in an adsorption tube and exposed to a known concentration (usually 1% by<br>
volume) of contaminant gas(es) in a tempered, humidified, clean air system. The gas<br>
stream is calibrated to deliver a total flow rate of 1450±20 ml/min. The removal<br>
capacity is calculated as the amount (in grams) of contaminant removed from the air<br>
stream per volume (cubic centimeters) of media at a 50 parts per million ("ppm")<br>
breakthrough.<br>
More specifically, the air utilized must be tempered, humidified, clean, oil-<br>
free, and compressed. Accordingly, the air must be passed through a bed of activated<br>
carbon followed by a filter bed containing sodium permanganate impregnated<br>
alumina pellets. Each filter bed should contain at least 300 ml (18.3 cu. in.) of media<br>
for each liter per minute (0.035 cfm) of air flow. The media in each filter bed should<br>
be changed before each test.<br>
Media samples are preferably obtained from unopened original manufacturer's<br>
shipping or storage containers chosen at random whenever possible. The entire<br>
container, whenever possible or practical, should be sampled by taking small amounts<br>
of media from throughout the container and combining them into one larger sample.<br>
The sample should be thoroughly mixed before being analyzed. Guidance on<br>
sampling may be obtained from ASTM Standard E300, entitled Recommended<br>
Practice for Sampling Industrial Chemicals. If a test is to be run comparing media of<br>
the same size or different sizes, the sample collected may be screened through the<br>
appropriate sieves to sort the media by size.<br>
Using an appropriate sampling method, obtain a representative sample of<br>
media (approximately 400 grams should be sufficient) and determine its apparent<br>
density as per ASTM 2854, or an equivalent method. Obtain an adsorption tube which<br>
is a cylindrical tube where glass wool and/or beads are optionally placed below the<br>
media, and the media and optional glass wool or beads are supported by stainless steel<br>
mesh, a perforated slotted glass disc, or a perforated slotted ceramic disc positioned<br>
below the media and glass wool or beads. After the adsorption tube having the glass<br>
wool or glass beads has been calibrated for the volume of a known depth of media,<br>
weigh the adsorption tube to the nearest 1.0 mg. Fill the adsorption tube to the desired<br>
depth via alternately filling and gently tamping the tube to eliminate any dead space<br>
until the desired depth is reached. Weigh the filled adsorption tube to the nearest 1.0<br>
mg.<br>
The filled media tube is arranged such that a mixture of air and contaminated<br>
gas enters the bottom of the tube, flows through the glass wool or beads, flows<br>
through the filtration media, and is then analyzed by a gas analyzer. Leaks in the gas<br>
system should be checked for and eliminated before beginning the analysis of the<br>
sample. Rotameters, analyzers, recorders, etc. should be calibrated over appropriate<br>
ranges according to the manufacturer's instructions or other standard methods such as<br>
ASTM Standard D3195, before any media is introduced into the system. Also, air and<br>
gas flow requirements should be determined and checked against supply capabilities<br>
to assure proper air and gas flows to the system.<br>
Once the adsorption tube is in position, start the flow of the mixture of<br>
contaminated gas and air and record the time, or time the test using a stop watch.<br>
Continue the flow of the mixture of gas and air until a breakthrough of 50 ppm is<br>
observed or indicated by the gas analyzer. Record the time at breakthrough. It is<br>
preferable to use a gas analyzer capable of variable scale readouts to 50 ppm (±5<br>
ppm), having specific or multiple gas capabilities.<br>
The data obtained from the above analysis will yield the gas capacity of the<br>
media tested using the following equation:<br>
GAS CAPACITY (GM/CC) = (K x 10-5)(C)(F)(tb) / V<br>
where:<br>
K=1.52 for H2S, 2.86 for SO2, 3.17 for Cl2, 2.15 for CH3SH, 0.76 for NH3,<br>
2.05 for NO2, 1.16 for C2H4, 1.34 for OCH2, and 1.39 for NO.<br>
C=Concentration of challenge gas in air stream, Volume %.<br>
F=Total stream flow rate, cc/min.<br>
tb =Time to 50 ppm breakthrough, minutes.<br>
V=Volume of the adsorption tube media column, cc.<br>

Mercaptan.<br>

1.0% methyl mercaptan gas at a constant flow rate and monitoring the concentration<br>
of methyl mercaptan in the gas stream exiting the solid filtration media as described<br>
in Example 5.<br><br>
It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates only to certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention and that numerous modifications or alterations<br>
may be made therein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.<br>
