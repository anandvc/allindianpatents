				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOE DISTILLATION OF ORGANOSILICON COMPOUNDS THAT<br>
CONTAIN ACRYLOXY OR METHACRYLOXY GROUPS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for distillation of<br>
organosilicon compounds that contain acryloxy or methacryloxy groups, and<br>
more specifically to a method for distillation of the aforementioned compounds,<br>
wherein, in spite of the fact that distillation is carried out in the presence of such<br>
inhibitors as hindered phenols or hindered-phenol precursors that have an<br>
onium-salt structure, the process proceeds without coloration, and the<br>
distillation fraction is obtained as a colorless organosilicon compound that<br>
contains acryloxy or methacryloxy groups.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Jt is known that organosilicon compounds that contain acryloxy or<br>
methaoy}loxy groups react with radicai-polymerizable monomers such as<br>
methyacralate and styrene and are used as starting mairia1s for<br>
copolymers obtained from the aforementioned monomers or as modifiers for the<br>
aforementioned monomers<br>
[0003] A method known in the art for synthesis of the aforementioned<br>
organosilicon compounds that contain acryloxy or methacryloxy groups consists<br>
of causing an addition reaction between acrylosy or methacryloxy acid esters of<br>
phenols or alcohols with aliphatic unsaturated bonds and organosilicon<br>
compounds that contain silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, and then separating the<br>
organosilicon compounds with acryloxy or methacryloxy groups from the<br>
obtained reaction mixture by distillation. The organosilicon compounds with<br>
acryloxy or methacryloxy groups obtained by the above-described method are<br>
prone to polymerization and to an increase in the molecular weight that can<br>
easily occur during reaction of synthesis or in the step of distillation. For<br>
suppressing the undesired polymerization, radical polymerization inhibitors are<br>
generally added.<br>
[0004] For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Kokai") Hei 5-186478 (equivalent to EP0520477)<br>
discloses a method with the use of N,N-dialkylaminomethylenephenols as<br>
 polymerization inhibitors. furthermore, kokai hei 9-295987 and Kokai Hei 9-<br>
296007 (equivalent to EP0803507), disclose processes with the use of<br>
polymerization inhibitors in the form of hindered phenols having an onium-salt<br>
structure. These inhibitors are naturally colorless and possess extremely high<br>
polymerization-inhibiting power. However, when organosilicon compounds that<br>
contan acryloxy or methaacry groups undergo distillation in the presence of <br>
the aforementionedpolymerization inhibitors, the distillation fractions are<br>
subject to coloration, and it becomes very difficult to obtain. colorless distillation<br>
fractions of high purity.<br>
[0005] Kokai Sho 48-85501 (equivalent to US3801615) discloses a method for<br>
decoloration of benzoquinone, which is a coloring component, by adding an<br>
olefinic unsaturated conjugated diene to oxidation-polymerizable monoolefinic<br>
unsaturated monomer synthesized by distillation with the use of hydroquinone<br>
as an inhibitor. However, the use of hindered phenols in the above method as<br>
polymerization inhibitors cannot prevent coloration of the distillation fractions,<br>
this occurs, probably, because the benzoquinone and the coloring substance<br>
admixed with the distillation fraction have different structures.<br>
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
inhibiting coloration of products of distillation of organosilicon compounds with<br>
acryloxy or methacryloxy groups when the distillation is carried in the presence<br>
of polymerization inhibitors in the form of hindered phenols having an oniunv<br>
salt structure or their hindered phenol precursors.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0007] The present invention relates to a method for distillation of<br>
organosilicon compounds that contain acryloxy or methacryloxy groups<br>
characterized by subjecting an organosilicon compound (A) that contains<br>
acryloxy or methacryloxy groups to distillation in the presence of a<br>
polymerization inhibitor (B) of the following general formula (1);<br>
(where, M is an atom selected from the group consisting of N, r, As, Sb, O, S, Se,<br>
Sn and L' R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group or a hydrogen atom,' m is 1, 2 or<br>
3; and X is a conjugated base of an organic acid or inorganic acid) and a<br>
compound (C) with aliphatic conjugated unsaturated bonds.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0008] The invention will be further described in more detail.<br>
[0009] There are no special restrictions with regard to the structure of the<br>
organosilicon compound (A) that contains acryloxy or methacryloxy groups,<br>
except that it should contain acryloxy or methacryloxy groups and should have a<br>
boiling point that provides isolation under the effect of distillation.<br>
[0010] The following are examples of the aforementioned organosilicon<br>
compound: 3-methacryloxypropyl-dimethylchlorosilane, 3-methacryloxypropyl-<br>
methyldichlorosilane, 3-methacryloxypropy-richlorosilane or similar<br>
chlorosilanes that contain methacryloxy groups; 3-acryloxypropyl-<br>
dimethylchlorosilane, 3-acryloxypropylmethyl-dichlorosilane, 3-acryloxypropyl -<br>
trichlorosilane, or similar chlorosilanes that contain acryloxy groups, 3-<br>
methacryloxypropyl-dimethylmethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyl-<br>
methyldimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-<br>
methaciyloxypropyl-dimethylethoxysilane, 3-naethacryloxypropyl-<br>
methyldiethoxysilane, 3-inethacryloxypropyl-triethoxysilane, or similar<br>
alkoxjrsilanes that contain methacryloxs^ groups! 3-acryloxj'prop3rl-<br>
diniethylmethoxysilane, S-acryloxj^propylmethyl-dimethoxj^silane, 3-<br>
acrylozypropyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-acryloxypropyl-dimethylethoxysilane, 3-<br>
acryloxypropyl-methyldiethoxysilane, 3-acryloxypropyl-triethoxysilane or similar<br>
alkoxysilanes that contain acryloxy groups; 1,3-bis (methacryloxypropyl)<br>
tetramethyldisiloxane, (methacryloxypropyl) pentamethyldisiloxane,<br>
methacrylosypropyl- tris (trirnethylsilosy) silane or similar siloxane oligomers<br>
that contain methacryloxy groups; 1,3-bis (acryloxypropsd)<br>
tetramethyldisiloxane, acryloxypropyl-pentamethyldisiloxane, acryloxypropyl<br>
tris (trimethylsiloxy) silane or similar siloxane oligomers that contain acryloxy<br>
groups.<br>
[0011] Component (A) can be synthesized by a known method which is<br>
described, e.g., in Kokai 5-186478 and Kokai 9-295987. According to an<br>
appropriate method, an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester of phenol or an alcohol<br>
with aliphatic unsaturated bonds and alkoxysilane or chlorosilane with silicon-<br>
bonded hydrogen atoms are subjected to a hydrosilation reaction in the presence<br>
of component (B). Furthermore, for obtaining siloxane oligomers that contain<br>
acryloxy or methacryloxy groups, low-molecular-weight alkoxysilanes or<br>
chlorosilanes with acryloxy or methacryloxy groups can be either subjected to<br>
hydrolysis and condensation, or caused to react with linear-chain, cyclic, or<br>
branched organosiloxane oligomers in the presence of an acidic catalyst.<br>
[0012] A polymerization inhibitor that constitutes component (B) is intended<br>
for inhibiting polymerization and increase in molecular weight during synthesis<br>
and/or distillation of aforementioned component (A). Component (B) can be<br>
represented by hindered phenols expressed by the following general formulae:<br>
(where, M is an atom selected from the group consisting of N, P, As, Sb, O,<br>
S ,Se ,Sn and I; R is a univalent hydrocarbon group or hydrogen atom; m is 1, 2<br>
or 35 X is a conjugated base of an organic or inorganic acid). In the above<br>
formula, R may designate a hydrogen atom or a univalent hydrocarbon group<br>
such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, or a similar alkyl group; vinyl<br>
group, allyl group, butenyl group, or a similar alkenyl group; phenyl group, tolyl<br>
group, xylyl group, or a similar aryl group; phenethyl group, diphenylmethyl<br>
group, or a similar aralkyl group. Of these, most preferable are alkyl group or<br>
hydrogen atoms, especially alkyl groups and hydrogen atoms. In the above<br>
formula, M may designate an atom selected from the group consisting of N, P,<br>
As, Sb, O, S, Se, Sn and I m may be 1, 2 or 3, but when M is N, P, As, or Sb, m is<br>
3, when M is O, S, Se, or Sn, m is 2, and when M is I, m is 1. X designates a<br>
conjugated base of an organic or inorganic acid and may comprise a halide ion in<br>
the form of a conjugated base of hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, or the<br>
like, a conjugated base of acetic acid, propionic acid, acrylic acid, or a similar<br>
carboxylic acid, as well as a conjugated base of a sulfonic acid or phosphoric acid.<br>
[0013] Appropriate compounds are exemplified by the following chemical<br>
structures, where R and X are the same as defined above:<br>
[0016] Component (B) may have chemical structures shown above, of which<br>
those given below are most preferable (in the following formulae R designates<br>
hydrogen atom or the same univalent hydrocarbon group as defined above).<br>
[0018] Those of the aforementioned compounds that comprise hindered phenols<br>
with an onium salt structure can be easily synthesiaed by a known method that<br>
consists of reacting hindered phenols, having an appropriate Lewis base<br>
structure, with an organic or inorganic acid or an organic halide.<br>
[0019] The following compounds are most suitable for component (B) from the<br>
point of view of availability and ease of synthesis<br>
[0020] An effective amount of component (B) that should be added to the<br>
process depends on conditions of the synthesis reaction and distillation, but, in<br>
general, the added amount should be within the range of 0.001 wt.% to 10 wt.%.<br>
[0021] A compound with aliphatic conjugated unsaturated bonds that<br>
constitutes component (C) is intended for capturing coloring components<br>
generated in the aforementioned component (B) with its conjugated unsaturated<br>
bonds, and forming into adducts with a high boiling point, and are not admixed<br>
with the distillation fractions.<br>
[0022] The following are examples of compounds suitable for use as component<br>
(C): butadiene, piperylene, isoprene, cyclopentadiene, 2-phenylbutadiene,<br>
bicyclohexene, 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1-phenylbutadiene,<br>
9,10 -dimethylanthracene, 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane, 1,2-<br>
diethylidenecyclohexene, 1-methoxybutadiene, l,l'-bicyclopentene, conjugated<br>
linolic acid, dehydrated castor oil, or similar conjugated diene-structure<br>
compounds; alloocimene, tung oil, creleostearic acid or a similar conjugated<br>
toriene-structure compound; cyclooctatetraene, or a similar conjugated tetraene-<br>
structure compound.<br>
[0023] In some distilling condition, if the adduct with a coloring substance and<br>
component (C) have low boiling points, it would be impossible to obtain a<br>
colorless fraction of distillation due to contamination of them with distillation<br>
fraction depending upon distillation conditions, and therefore it is necessary to<br>
provide component (C) with as high boiling point as possible. From this point of<br>
view, it is recommended to use a conjugated linolic acid, dehydrated castor on,<br>
fung oil. creleostearic acid. and cyclpooctatetraene......:of these o-eleostraaric acid<br>
and cyelooctatetraene are most preferable as they have conjugated triene<br>
structures or conjugated tetraene structures highly reactive with coloring<br>
substances, while a tung oil is most preferable from the point of view of<br>
avai;ability<br>
[0024] It is recommended to use component (C) in an excess of the amount only<br>
needed for obtaining a colorless fraction. The minimal amount required for the<br>
process will depend on many factors, such as the quantity and chemical structure<br>
required for the target organosilicon compound with acryloxy or methacryloxy<br>
groups, the boiling point, the quantity and the boiling point required for the<br>
target compound, as well as on the chemicals structure, boiling point, and other<br>
characteristics of component (C) itself. In general, however, component (C)<br>
should be used in an amount from 0.1 wt. % to 3000 wt. % relative to the weight<br>
of component (B).<br>
[0025] During distillation, component (C) can be used alone<br>
or in combination with inorganic powders, glass beads, carbon black or other<br>
substances that can absorb (C) on their surfaces or fix component (C) with a<br>
chemical bond on their surfaces. In the last-mentioned case, component (C) can<br>
be represented by a lower-melting-point compound. If component (C) is fixed<br>
with chemical modification on the surface of such additives, it is required that<br>
the residual group contain aliphatic conjugated unsaturated bonds.<br>
[0026] It is recommended that distillation of component (A) be conducted under<br>
low pressure and at a temperature as low as possible. This is because the above<br>
condition facilitates suppression of polymerization and increase in molecular<br>
weight, allows for decrease in the amount of the added polymerization inhibitor,<br>
and allows for decrease in the amount of coloring substance formed during<br>
distillation. For example, distillation can be carried out under pressure below<br>
3000 Pa, preferably below 1500 Pa, and at a temperature between 80 and<br>
150 °C , preferably between 100 and 130 °C.<br>
[0027] In the distillation process, polymerization and increase in the molecular<br>
weight of component (A) may be further inhibited by additionally compounding<br>
components (B) and (C) with metal halides disclosed in Kokai 5-271248. Such a<br>
metal halide may comprise, e.g., copper chloride. Other additives may comprise<br>
known antioxidants such as hindered phenol compounds (except for component<br>
(B)), amine-type compounds, quinone-type compounds, or the like. Of these,<br>
most preferable are hindered phenols (except for component (B)). Although<br>
there are no restrictions with regard to the amounts in which the<br>
aforementioned antioxidants can be used, it is recommended that their amount<br>
in the reaction mixtures with component (A) be within the range of 01-10 wt. %.<br>
The use of copper chloride and antioxidants is especially advantageous when<br>
component (A) is represented by 3-methacryloxypropyl-dimethylchlorosilane.<br>
[0028] In spite of the fact that normally the use of onium-structured hindered<br>
phenols and their precursors that possess strong polymerization inhibiting<br>
capacity is accompanied by coloration of distillation fractions, the distillation<br>
method of the invention makes it possible to obtain organosilicon compounds<br>
with acryloxy and methacryloxy groups which are colorless even with the use of<br>
the aforementioned high-capacity inhibitors. Since the organosilicon compounds<br>
with acryloxy and methacryloxy groups obtained by the method of the invention<br>
are colorless, by reacting them with radical-polymerizable monomers, it is<br>
possible to prepare starting material for copolymers that can be derived from<br>
such monomers or to prepare modifiers for polymers obtained from the<br>
aforementioned monomers. In other words, the aforementioned<br>
organopolysiloxanes may find application in the fields of industry that requires<br>
optically colorless properties.<br>
[0029] Examples<br>
The invention will be further described with reference to application examples.<br>
In order to quantitatively evaluate the color of the fractions obtained after<br>
distillation, the light absorbance of the fractions was measured with the use of<br>
an UV spectro photometer at a wavelength of 350 nm. In observation with the<br>
naked eye, the fraction with absorbance below 0.055 at 350 nm wavelength was<br>
seen as completely colorless.<br>
[0030] Reference Example 1<br>
[Preparation of Hydrochloride of N,N-Dialkylaminomethylenephenol]<br>
A transparent liquid solution was prepared by mixing 1 g (3.8 mmol) of 2,6-<br>
di-t-butyl-4-dimethylaminomethylphenol, 0.76 g (8.4 mmol) of trimethylsilanol<br>
and 30 ml of toluene. While the mixture was stirred, 0.46 g (4.2 mmol) of<br>
trimethylchlorosilane were added to the mixture dropwise, whereby a white<br>
precipitate was formed. The product was stirred for 30 min. at room<br>
temperature, and the white precipitate was separated by filtering. The<br>
obtained white precipitate was washed with toluene and then dried in vacuum<br>
for 1 hour at 80 °C. The weight of the obtained white precipitate was 0.7 g.<br>
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and infra-red (IR) light-absorption<br>
analysis of the white precipitate showed that it was hydrochloride of 2,6-drt-<br>
butyl-4-dimethylaminomethylenephenol having the following chemical structure:<br>
[0031] Reference Example 2<br>
[Synthesis of Methacryloxypropyl Dimethylchlorosilane]<br>
A four-neck flask equipped with a stirrer was loaded with 1000 g (7.92 mole) of<br>
allyl methacrylate (AMA) (the product of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Ltd.) and<br>
1.5 g of the Ivydrochloride of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-dimethylaminomethylenephenol<br>
prepared in aforementioned Reference Example 1. The mixture was then<br>
combined and further mixed with a complex of platinum and 1,3-<br>
divinyltetramethyldisiloxane (the content of metallic platinum was 20 ppm per<br>
total weight of the allyl methacrylate and dimethylchlorosilane). While the<br>
mixture was stirred and heated at 80 °C, a small amount of dimethylchlorosilane<br>
was added dropwise. After verification of the fact that reaction has been<br>
initiated, the reaction system was cooled by water or by air, and the temperature<br>
was maintained within the range of 65-75 °C, 682 g (7.2 mole) while<br>
dimethylchlorosilane were added dropwise. When the addition process was<br>
over, the product was stirred for 1 hour at 70 °C. A small sample was taken<br>
from the reaction mixture. The area percent of the gas chromatography (GLC)<br>
peak of obtained methacryloxypropyl dimethylchlorosilane was 70 %.<br>
[0032] Application Example 1<br>
A four-neck flask equipped with a stirrer was loaded with 400 g of the reaction<br>
mixture obtained in Reference Example 2, 0. 2 g of 2)6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol,<br>
4 g of Copper(II) chloride, anhydrous and 4 g of tung oil (the product of Kimura<br>
Shoji), and the mixture was subjected to distillation in a 10 cm-long Vigreux<br>
column under a reduced pressure of 1330 Pa. The residue comprised 50 g of a<br>
lowviscosity brown liquid. 190 g of the 110-120 °C distillation fraction was<br>
sampled. Gas chromatography analysis of the sample showed that the obtained<br>
colorless fraction comprised 3-methacryloxypropyl-dimethylchlorosilane. GLC<br>
purity of the product was 97.0 %. Absorbance of the obtained 3-<br>
methacryloxypropyl-dimethylchlorosilane measured at 350 nm was 0.028.<br>
[0033] Application Example 2<br>
Distillation was carried out under the same conditions as in Application<br>
Example 1, with the exception that the tung oil was replaced by the same<br>
quantity of a linolic acid (the product of KF TRADING Co.,LTD, tradename Hy-<br>
Diene). The residue comprised 56 g of a low-viscosity brown liquid. 198 g of the<br>
obtained colorless distillation fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography<br>
analysis that showed that the product comprised 3-methacryloxypropyl-<br>
dimethylchlorosilane. GLC purity of the product was 97.1 %. Absorbance of the<br>
obtained 3-niethaciylo2kypropyl diinetlrylchlorosilane measured at 350 nm was<br>
0.042.<br>
[0034] Application Example 3<br>
Distillation was carried out under the same conditions as in Application<br>
Example 1, with the exception that the tung oil was replaced by the same<br>
quantity of a dehydrated castor oil (the product of KF TRADING Co.,LTD,<br>
tradename Dassui Himashiyu [Dehydrated Castor Oil]). The residue comprised<br>
64 g of a low-viscous brown liquid. 198 g of the obtained colorless distillation<br>
fraction was anafyzed by gas chromatography analysis that showed that the<br>
product comprised 3-methacryloxypropyl-dimethylchlorosilane. GLC purity of<br>
the product was 97.1 %. Absorbance of the obtained 3-inethacrj'loxypropyl<br>
dimethylchlorosilane measured at 350 nm was 0.030.<br>
[0035] Comparative Example 1<br>
Distillation was carried out under the same conditions as in Application<br>
Example 1, but without the use of the tung oil. The residue comprised 82 g of a<br>
low-viscosity brown liquid. 214 g of the obtained distillation fraction was<br>
analyzed by gas chromatography analysis that showed that the product<br>
comprised 3-methacryloxypropyl dimethylchlorosilane. GLC purity of the<br>
product was 97.5 %. However, the fraction had a yellow color. Absorbance of the<br>
obtained 3-methacryloxypropyl dimethylchlorosilane measured at 350 nm was<br>
0.060.<br>
