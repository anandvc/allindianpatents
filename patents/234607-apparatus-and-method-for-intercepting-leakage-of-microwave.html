1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a lighting apparatus using microwave and<br>
particularly, to an apparatus and method for intercepting leakage of microwave<br>

Generally, the apparatus using a microwave is an apparatus for<br>
generating visible rays or ultraviolet rays by applying microwave to an<br>
electrodeless bulb. The electrodeless bulb in the lighting apparatus has longer life<br>
span than that of incandescent lamp or fluorescent lamp which is generally used<br>
and has higher lighting effect.<br>
Figure 1 is a view showing a composition of a conventional lighting<br>
apparatus using microwave.<br>

microwave includes a magnetron 17 positioned-in a case 16 of the lighting<br>
apparatus, for generating microwave, a high voltage generator 18 for supplying an<br>
alternate current power source into the magnetron 17 after raising the voltage into<br>
a high voltage, a waveguide 15 for inducing microwave from the magnetron 17, an<br>
electrodeless bulb 14 for generating light by absorbing energy of the microwave<br>
induced by the waveguide 15, a resonator 12 covered on the front side of the<br>
electrodeless bulb 14. for intercepting the microwave and passing the light<br>
generated from the electrodeless bulb 14. a reflector 11 for reflecting the light from<br>
the resonator 12 to be directly moved, a mirror 13 positioned at the lower portion<br>

apparatus using microwave, a bulb motor 19 for rotating the electrodeless bulb 14<br>
and a fan motor 20 for driving the cooling fan 21 are further installed.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the conventional lighting apparatus using<br>
microwave will be described as follows<br>
First, a control unit (not shown) outputs a criving signal into the high<br>
voltage generator 18 At this time, the high voltage generator 18 raises the voltage<br>
of the alternate current and supplies the raised voltage into the magnetron 17<br>
The magnetron 17 generates microwave by blistering by the high voltage<br>
supplied from the high voltage generator 18 and emits- the generated microwave<br>
into the waveguide 15 Here, the microwave is emitted to the inside of the<br>
resonator 12, generates light having a specific discharge spectrum by emitting the<br>
luminescent material sealed in the electrodeless bulb 14 and the light is reflected<br>
to the front side by the reflector 11 and the mirror 13 lighting the space.<br>

magnetron 17 and the electrodeless bulb 14 by driving the bulb motor 19 and fan<br>
motor 20 when the high voltage generator is driven, to prevent the magnetron from<br>
being overheated by generating heat by itself.<br>
However, the conventional lighting apparatus using microwave has some<br>
problems that it damages the circumstance leaking the microwave through the<br>
damaged when the resonator 12 is damaged by an unexpected reason or high<br>
heat generated in the electrodeless bulb 14.<br>
Also, the conventional lighting apparatus using microwave has a problem<br>
that safety of a user is hindered since the microwave is leaked to outside if the<br>
resonator 12 is operated under the condition that it is damaged.<br>

Hereinafter, the operation of the apparatus for intercepting leakage of the<br>

First, the magnetron 207 generates microwave by blistering by the power<br>

will be described in detail with reference to Figures 3 and 4 Here, the sensing unit<br>

Figure 3 is a view showing a composition of a lighting apparatus using<br>
microwave in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
As shown in Figure 3. the lighting apparatus using the microwave includes<br>
a power source unit 303 for supplying a power source, a relay unit 304 for passing<br>
or intercepting the current applied from the power source unit 303 according to a<br>
control signal, a high voltage generator 208 for supplying an alternate current<br>

intercepting the microwave and passing the light generated from the electrodeless<br>
bulb 204. an optical detection unit 306 for generating a corresponding optical<br>
detection signal by detecting light generated from the electrodeless bulb 204 a<br>
current detection unit 305 for generating a corresponding current detection signal<br>
by detecting a current applied to the magnetron 207, a control unit 301 for<br>
generating and outputting the control signal into the relay unit 304 by determining<br>
that the microwave is leaking on the basis of the current detection signal, optical<br>
detection signal and the time from the point of time that the relay unit 304 is turned<br>
on and the optical detection signal of the optical detection unit 306 and a cooling<br>
unit 302 for cooling heat generated in the magnetron 207 and high voltage<br>
generator 208 Here, the cooling unit 302 includes the bulb motor 209. fan motor<br>
210 and the cooling fan 211<br>
The operation of the apparatus for intercepting leakage of the microwave<br>
in the lighting apparatus in accordance with the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes the optical detection unit 306, current detection unit 301 and the<br>
relay unit 304. Namely, the sensing unit 200. further including the optical detection<br>
unit 306. current detection unit 301 and the relay unit 304, can intercept the<br>
microwave by accurately and rapidly sensing leakage of the microwave<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the apparatus for intercepting leakage of the<br>
microwave in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
will be described in detail with reference to Figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowing chart showing a method for intercepting leakage of<br>
microwave in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, the relay unit 304 applies a power supplied from the power source<br>
unit 303 to the high voltage generator 208 according to the control signal outputted<br>
from the control unit 301. The high voltage generator 208 raises the voltage of the<br>
power applied through the relay unit 304 and supplies the power to the magnetron<br>
207. Here, the relay unit 304 turns on or off the operation of the magnetron 207 by<br>
passing or intercepting the power supplied from the power supply unit 303<br>
according to the control signal outputted from the control unit 301. Namely, the<br>
relay unit 304 intercepts the leaking microwave by turning off the operation of the<br>
magnetron 207 in case the microwave is leaked to the outside under the condition<br>
that the operation of the magnetron is on (S401 to S432).<br>
The magnetron receives the voltage-raised power from the high frequency<br>
generator 208 and generates microwave. The generated microwave is focused to<br>
the electrodeless bulb in the resonator 202 through the waveguide 205. At this<br>
time, the electrodeless bulb 204 generates light by absorbing the energy of the<br>
microwave.<br>
Then, the current detection unit 305 detects the current applied to the<br>
magnetron 207 and outputs the corresponding current detection signal into the<br>
control unit. Namely, the current detection unit 305 detects the current applied to<br>
the magnetron 207 from the high voltage generator 208 using the current<br>
transformer, converts the detected current into a voltage (current detection signal)<br>
and outputs the voltage into the control unit 301 (S403).<br>
On the other hand, the optical detection unit 306 is driven after a<br>
predetermined time (3 seconds) from the point of time when the current detection<br>
signal is generated from the current detection signal or when the relay unit 304 is<br>
turned on, converts the light emitted from the electrodeless bulb 204 to the outside<br>
into an optical signal and outputs an optical signal into the control unit 301 by<br>
generating the corresponding optical detection signal. Here, the optical detection<br>
unit 306, installed at the waveguide 205 or (and) at the circumference of the<br>
reflector, converts the light emitted to the outside of the electrodeless bulb 204 into<br>
an optical signal and generates the signal into a corresponding optical detection<br>
signal.<br>
The control unit 301 determines whether the microwave is leaking on the<br>
basis of the current detection signal generated from the current detection unit 305,<br>
the optical detection signal generated from the optical detection unit 306 or the<br>
predetermined time (3 seconds) passed from the point of time when the relay unit<br>
304 is turned on and the optical detection signal generated from the optical<br>
detection unit 306 and outputs the control signal into the relay unit 304. Namely,<br>
the control unit 301 determines that the microwave is leaking if the optical<br>
detection signal is not inputted from the optical detection unit 306 in the<br>
predetermined time (3 seconds) from the point of time when the microwave is<br>
generated and outputs the control signal for turning off the operation of the relay<br>
unit into the relay unit 304. Here, the it is desirable that the predetermined time is<br>
maximum 3 second or shorter time and the control unit 301 determines that the<br>
microwave is leaking if the optical detection signal is not inputted in the three<br>
seconds.<br>
Then, the relay unit 304 receives the control signal from the control unit<br>
301 and turns off the operation of the magnetron 207 by intercepting the power<br>
source supplied from the power source unit 303. The microwave can be<br>
intercepted by turning off the operation of the magnetron 207.<br>
microwave can intercept leakage of microwave by sensing the microwave leaked<br>
by damage of the resonator at real time.<br>
Also, the apparatus and method for intercepting leakage of microwave can<br>
also prevent a fire by leakage of the microwave and secure safety of the user by<br>
intercepting the microwave leaked by damage of the resonator of the lighting<br>
apparatus using the microwave<br>
Also, the apparatus and method for intercepting leakage of microwave can<br>
also can intercept leakage of microwave by sensing the microwave leaked by<br>
damage of the resonator of the lighting apparatus using the microwave at real time.<br>
