If These Herbs Are Safe To Apply For The Skin Then They Are Surely Safe For The Air Too.<br><br>
Aloe-vera a medicinal plant, has been the most important component of traditional Indian Medicine from ancient period. Aloe-vera is also known as "Ghrita Kumari" in Sanskrit, "Guarpatha" in Hindi, "Korphad" in Marathi, "Chothukatrali" in Tamil, "Chinna Kalabanda" in Telugu and "Kumari" in Oriya and Bengali. Reffered as 'plant of immortality' in Egyptian documents, its healing benefits are well recognized in the ancient Indian, Chinese, Greek and Roman Civilization.<br>
Aloe-vera, a plant family of Liliaceae, is reported to be originated in the warm, dry climate of Africa. It is scattered across the warm regions of the globe because of its adaptive nature. It is known that Arabians had brought Aloe-vera plant to India. It is found as a wild plant along the coast of southern India. It is grown as an ornamental plant as well as medicinal plant in almost all states of India. Such as Chattisgarh, Gujarat, UttarPradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra , and Andhra Pradesh. Around 240 species of Aloe-vera are known to the scientific world. Out of which only 3 to 4 species have medicinal properties such as the Aloe-vera Barbadenis which is considered as most potent one.<br>
The first detailed discussion of Aloe-vera's medicinal properties was found in an Egyptian document called 'Papyrus ebers'. The products prepared from Aloe-vera, leaves have multiple properties such as emollient, purgative, vulnerary, anti-bacterial, anti¬inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anesthetic, aphrodisiac and cosmetic. 96% of the plant is water and rest is active ingredients like essential oil, amino acids, minerals, Vitamins, enzymes and glycoproteins. Food and Agricultural organization (FAO) has identified Aloe-vera, as 'a new plant resource with the most promising prospects in the world.' Few developed countries like USA are doing serious medical research on the uses of its products. Food and Drug Administration of USA has already approved the developmental study of Aloe-vera, in the treatment of Cancer and Aids.<br>
The applications and uses of Aloe-vera, can be categorized as below;<br>
External Applications:	The external uses of Aloe-vera, products are primarily as<br>
skin healer and cosmetic .The healing effect of Aloe-vera products is because of its ability to prevent injury to epithetical tissues ( skin -layer) and promote healing to injured tissues. It soothes a variety of skin ailments such as mild cuts, insect stings, bruises, poison ivy and eczema. Cosmetologists call it as ' water of youth' because of its anti-<br><br>
wrinkle properties. Its rate of absorption in the skin is four times higher than water , making it a good moisturizer. In addition to these, it acts as anti-ageing agent by stimulating fibroblast which helps in manufacturing of collagen, the protein that controls the ageing process of the skin. The washing of eyeswith Aloe-vera from ultraviolet rays coming from the sun.<br>
Internal Applications: The Aloe-vera, products can be taken internally in the form of powder, tablets, and juices. The juice and supplement of Aloe-vera, is highly useful to digestive tract irritations such as colitis and peptic ulcers. It also facilitates digestion, blood and lymphatic circulation and functioning of kidneys, liver and gall bladder.<br>
Aloe-vera, is a perennial, tropical crop which can be cultivated in drought areas. It prefers to reside on full sun and does not require much watering. The leaves of the Aloe-vera plant grow from the base in the rosette pattern. Each plant usually has 12 to 16 leaves. The plant can be harvested in every 6 to 8 week by removing 3 to 4 leaves per plant.<br>
We decided to invent an air freshener- by using as Aloe-vera gel as the base.<br>
The Natural fragrances are used as herbal - health-benefit- agents. All the herbs have different health - benefit - agent, and they have different aromas, e.g. Tulsi, Neem, Sandalwood, Lavang, Dalchini, Methi, Karela. All smell have different aromas, they are potential in nature and therefore the fragrant industry has used it to admix with the chemical substance for different types of uses; for example Mosquitoes coil, liquid mosquito repellent used for avoiding mosquitoes bites, is common practice. But inhaling the chemical substance is very harmful for human being and slowly the health of human being is destroyed. Now to prevent this inhaling of chemical substance the inventor has thought of making an air-freshener 100% from herbal source.<br>
Aloe-vera, which has not been used by any body so far for making air-freshener agent which is mixed with fragrance of different herbs, so as to refresh the air surrounding the human beings and the medicinal properties of these herbs are inhaled by human being for repairing the health or maintaining good health. The process is unique with appropriate proportions of ingredients mixed in a ratio at room temperature to keep<br><br>
the natural aroma. And when slowly it evaporates in the air, the surrounding air is refreshed with all its medicinal properties added to it.<br>
After a long Research on herbs, we came up with a novel discovery and manufactured a purely HERBAL NATURAL air- freshener with Aloe-vera gel, as base and oils / extract of herbs e.g. Tulsi added to it for wonderful result. This discovery makes us the pioneers.<br>
A-l     Preparation of Aloe-vera gel<br>
a)	Aloe-vera plant is easily available in India.<br>
b)	We shall purchase Aloe-vera leaves from the farmers.<br>
c)	In our unit we shall cut and scrape the gel from the leave with a special wooden knife.<br>
d)	Then we shall add oil of Tulsi to it, to preserve it naturally.<br>
e)	Since Tulsi is a natural preservative, for it is   anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti¬biotic , anti -septic.<br>
f)	Ratio is 99 gms of Aloe-vera with 1 gm of Tulsi oil.<br>
A-2     Preparation of Herbal Oils /extract from Herbs.<br>
e.g. Tulsi oil / extract preparation.<br>
a)	For the preparation of Tulsi oil we shall purchase Tulsi leaves from farmers.<br>
b)	Tulsi leaves shall be washed in water thoroughly.<br>
c)	Cut the leaves in 1/4 size ( for better result).<br><br><br>
d)	These shall be put on the perforated mesh in the Steam -Distillation units.<br>
e)	This shall be steamed at 90° temperature for 4 to 5 hrs.<br>
f)	The steam carried oil then goes into the condenser where it cools.<br>
g)	Then it goes into the separator tank where the oil is separated from the water.<br>
h)	By this process 70% Oil is obtained.<br>
i)	Extract of Tulsi is then mixed with Aloe-vera gel, it is used even to preserve<br>
Aloe-vera gel along with properties of Tulsi also mentioned before.<br>
j)	The oil of Tulsi has ether which destroys bacteria.<br>
A-3     Speed of the planetary mixer.<br>
a.	The speed of the planetary mixer is maintained below 45 rpm. At room<br>
temperature so as to achieve natural aroma.<br>
b.	A speed that is higher may destroy the enzymes and    other properties present<br>
in the Herbs and Aloe-vera gel, if it becomes warm.<br>
c.	And a lower rpm. may not bring out the maximum result in mixing..<br>
Accordingly there is provided a process of making Herbal air freshener comprising the following steps.<br>
i)   Extracting the herbs with steaming / distillation process.<br>
ii) Mixing in a planetary mixer the concentrated extract in step (i) with Aloe-vera gel in 1:9 ratio at room temperature.<br>
iii) Packaging in plastic containers with perforated lid covered by aluminum foil or any other peelable cover.<br><br>
The invention will now be described in with reference to examples 1 to 4 in the accompanying specification.<br>
Example 1.<br>
10 kg. Tulsi herbs is put in a reactor vessel and covered suitably and steamed for 4 to 5 hours to get an oily extract.<br>
Mixing 1 kg. of the extract with 99 kgs of Aloe-vera gel in a planetary mixer at room temperature for an hour and cooling subsequently. The herbal air-freshener is packed in plastic container of 100 gram units with perforated lid covered by aluminum foil or any other peelable cover.<br>
Example 2.<br>
10 kg Neem herbs is taken in reactor vessel and covered it suitably and steamed for 4 to 5 hours to get an oily extract.<br>
Mixing 1 kg of the extract with 99 kgs of Aloe-vera gel in a planetary mixer at room temperature for an hour and cooling subsequently. The herbal air-freshener is packed in plastic container of lOOgms units with perforated lid covered by aluminum foil or any other peelable cover.<br>
Example 3.<br>
10 kgs Sandalwood herbs is taken in the reactor vessel and covered it suitably and steamed for 4 to 5 hours to get an oily extracts.<br>
Mixing 1 kgs of the extract with 99kgs of Aloe-vera gel in planetary mixer at room temperature for an hour and cooling subsequently. The herbal air- fresheners packed in plastic container of 100 gram units with perforated lid covered by aluminum foil or any other peelable cover.<br><br>
Example 4.<br>
10 Kgs. Lavang herbs is taken in reactor vessel and covered it suitably and steamed for 4 to 5 hours to get an oily extract.<br>
Mixing 10 kgs of the extract with 90 kgs of Aloe-vera gel in a planetary mixer at room temperature for an hour and cooling for an hour and cooling subsequently. The herbal air freshener is packed in plastic container of 100 grms. unit with perforated lid covered by aluminum foil or any other peelable cover.<br>
Table<br><br>
From the table it is clear that optimum result obtained at a ratio of 1:9<br>
Evaporation and working of the lOOgms unit for 4 to 4 1/2 weeks is the best Atmospheric and Economic result.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible which are considered within the spirit and ambit of this invention.<br><br>
