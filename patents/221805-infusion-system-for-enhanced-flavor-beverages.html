INFUSION SYSTEM FOR ENHANCED FLAVOR BEVERAGES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 5<br>
The present invention is directed to infusible or water soluble material in combination with aroma compounds. More particularly, the present invention is directed to infusible or water soluble material in combination with aroma compounds wherein<br>
10  the infusible or water soluble material is a powder, or packed or placed in filter paper and contacted with water in order to brew a beverage having good flavor, and further wherein the aroma compounds are carried on carrier compounds, and mixed with or sprayed onto the infusible or water soluble material, or a combination thereof.<br>
15  Unexpectedly, the present invention results in a beverage having<br>
good flavor characteristics, even when a reduced amount of infusible or water soluble material is employed.<br>
20 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When making beverages, such as tea or coffee based beverages, it is common to use filter paper with tea leaf or ground coffee in, for example, urns in order to infuse the same to make the desired <br>
25  beverage. It is also common to prepare sachets or bags that contain tea leaf or ground coffee, as the case may be, and infuse .the same in a brewing apparatus or on a cup-by-cup basis.<br>
Some consumers choose not to drink tea and coffee since they <br>
30  are conscious of their intake of caffeine. Other consumers drink decaffeinated beverages; however, such decaffeinated products tend to have flavor and aroma characteristics that are inferior to beverages having their natural level of alkaloids. Hot chocolate or cocoa, on the other hand, is often not desired because it is high in<br><br>

calories and carbohydrates. It is of increasing interest to develop a beverage that has reduced levels of caffeine, calories or both, yet is good tasting. This invention, therefore, is directed to infusible or water soluble material in combination with aroma <br>
5	wherein the infusible or water soluble material is a powder or packed or placed in (or on) filter paper and contacted with an aqueous solvent (preferably, water) in order to brew a beverage having good flavor and further wherein the aroma compounds are carried on carrier compounds, and mixed with or sprayed onto the<br>
10  infusible or water soluble material, or a combination thereof.<br>
Unexpectedly, the present invention results in a beverage having good flavor characteristics, even when a reduced amount of infusible or water soluble material is employed.<br>
15  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>
Efforts have been disclosed for making infusible beverage precursors. In U.S. Patent No. 2,769,290, a method and apparatus for making tea bags or the like are described.<br>

- 9 -<br>
When making the beverage precursor, infusible or water soluble material (or both) is combined with aroma compound carried on or in the carrier compound. It is within the scope of this invention to <br>
5 	 employ conventional mixing (stirring or tumbling) techniques to combine the aromatizing composition and the infusible and/or water soluble material. It is also within the scope of this invention to spray the aroma and carrier compound directly onto the infusible or water soluble material. When spraying is the desired technique,<br>
10  often an aqueous emulsion (with an emulsifying agent like fatty-acid mono- or diglycerides, fatty acid esters with sorbitol) is prepared and sprayed with an air compressor. The pressure at which the emulsion is applied can vary, but the pressure is usually between about 1.5 and about 10.5 bars, and preferably, between about 2.5 and<br>
15  5.5 bars. Since the water employed typically evaporates (even at ambient temperature) it is not a required step to dry the infusible or water soluble material after spraying.<br>
The amount of dried aroma compound and carrier employed in <br>
20	this invention is typically from about 0.5 to about 25.0%, and preferably, from about 2.0 to about 30.0%, and most preferably, about 8.0 to about 15.0% by weight aroma compound, based on total weight of aroma compound, infusible material, water soluble material and carrier compound, and including all ranges subsumed therein. <br>
25<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the aroma compounds employed in this invention are tea aroma compounds. In an especially preferred embodiment, the tea aroma compounds described herein are used in decaffeinated tea bags wherein the aroma compounds are isolated from <br>
30  tea leaves prior to the same being decaffeinated.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention to employ conventional sweeteners, whiteners, flavors and/or spices in the beverage precursors and/or beverages described herein.<br><br>

EXAMPLE<br>
Decaffeinated tea bags were prepared by combining 1.70 grams of decaffeinated tea leaf (as prepared by Unilever Bestfoods) and<br>
10  0.25g tea aroma compound on a maltodextrin carrier (as may be made commercially available by Givaudan) . The resulting tea bags had over 10% less tea leaf then conventional decaffeinated tea bags. A taste panel was conducted to compare tea beverage prepared from the tea bags with aroma compound and tea beverage prepared from<br>
15  conventional decaffeinated tea bags. The beverages were made by infusing the tea bags with about eight ounces of water (at about 100Â°C). The resulting beverages were consumed after cooling to about 70-75Â°C. Fifty (50) panelists sampled the beverages, and unexpectedly, about two-thirds of the panelists preferred the tea<br>
