				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an improved lap stretch compensator of a combing machine connected to oscillating nippers in a combing machine to effectively guide the lap to be combed, fed to the feed roller mounted in the nipper.<br>
In combing machines known in the art ties bit to be combed is unwound by the rotation of lap feed rollers from a lap disposed thereon. The bat is delivered to the feed rollers mounted in oscillating nippers through an eccentric roller attached to the lap tension roller shaft and the fleece guide attached to the bottom nipper.<br>
In high speed combers the batt is to be guided from the lap feed roller area to the nipper feed roller area to avoid the stretch on the batt between the lap feed roller area and the nipper feed roller area. One stationary guide plate is provided extending from the lap feed roller area and another guide plate is attached to the oscillating bottom nipper bracket.<br>
Since the feed rollers mounted on tiles oscillating nipper are driven periodically it will result in non-uniform stretch on the batt between the lap feed roller and the nipper feed roller if the eccentric roller movement is not synchronized to the nipper feed roller. Also air turbulence may affect the batt if the batt is not properly protected against the air turbulence.<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to synchronize the nipper feed roll and the lap feed roller in order to maintain uniform stretch of the batt between lap feed roller and the nipper feed roller when the batt is routed through the guide plates.<br>
Another object of the invention is to guide the batt in between the lap feed roller and the nipper feed roll to protect the batt against the air turbulence.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a lap stretch compensator connected to oscillating nipper of a combing machine comprising a lap feed plate disposed near lap rollers of the combing machine for guiding the batt in the region of said lap rollers, a lap guide plate having a first end connected to an eccentric by means of a hinge and pin and a second end connected to the oscillating nipper by means of a fork and pin for facilitating alteration of the effective length of the batt traveling over it and thus avoids slackness or overstretching of the batt devoured to nipper feed roller and to avoid the influence of the air turbulence over the batt facilitating higher combing cycle rate of at least substantially 200 nips per minute.<br>
A preferred embodiment of an improved lap stretcher according to the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Fig-1 shows a schematic view in vertical section showing parts of the combing head of a comber,<br>
Fig-2a shows the nipper in its extreme forward position with the nippers in open position,<br>
Fig-2b shows the nipper in its extreme backward position with the nippers in closed position.<br>
Fig-3 shows the guide plate attached to the nipper and the eccentric.<br>
The combing head shown in fig 1 has lap rollers (1) and (1'), rotating comb shaft (12), nipper shaft (13) rotate able in reciprocation and two detaching rollers (14,14'), all mounted on the machine frame. The nipper shaft which reciprocates between the two positions shown in fig 2a and fig 2b, The rear end of the bottom nipper (3a) is attached to the crank (16). Front end of the bottom nipper attached to the arm (15), is pivotally mounted to the comb shaft (12), The lap which is to be combed is carried on the lap rollers (1) and (T) in the form of a coil. The lap unwind due to the rotation of the lap rollers (1) and (1*) and goes to the lap stretch compensator (4) and moves there on to the nipper feed roller (2) and there from to the nip between the top and bottom nippers.<br><br>
A lap feed plate (4a) is rigidly fitted to the frame of the comber and disposed such that a slightly curved edge (4al) of the lap feed plate (4a) is held just above the top nipper drive shaft (6). The said lap feed plate (4a) guide the batt in the region from the lap feed roller (1) to the lap guide plate (4b).<br>
Eccentrics (5) are hinged on the top nipper drive shaft (6) such that the axes of the top nipper drive shaft (6) and the eccentric (5) are parallel to each other and the eccentric (5) can swing freely on the nipper drive shaft (6). For ease of mounting and dismantling, the eccentrics (5) described in this embodiment consist of top and bottom part so that the eccentric (5) can be advantageously mounted on the top nipper drive shaft (6) easily. A pin (7) is provided to the bottom part of the eccentric (5) such that the axes of the pin (7) and the top nipper drive shaft (6) are parallel to each other. Support (8) provided with pins (9) for holding the lap guide plate (4b) are fastened to the bottom nipper bracket (3a). The lap stretch compensator (4) employs a contour so as to guide the batt gently. The lap stretch compensator (4) comprises a lap guide plate (4b) provided with a hinge (11) at a first end (4bl) to facilitate suspending the same on a pin (7) provided in the bottom part of the eccentric (5). The hinge (11) is made of a synthetic material to facilitate quiet operation avoiding metal to metal contact. The second end (4b2) of the lap guide plate (4b) is provided with a fork (10) which with the the lap guide plate (4b) can be gently inserted to the pin (9) attached to the support (8). The extreme backward movement position of the oscillating<br><br>
nipper is illustrated in Fig 2b. In this position, the distance between the lap feed roller (1) and the nipper feed roller (2) reduces as compared to its extreme forward movement position as illustrated in Fig 2a. Due to this there is reduction in the distance between the lap feed roller (1) and nipper feed roller (2), and the batt is slackened.<br>
One end of the lap guide plate (4b) of the lap stretch compensator is hinged to the pin (9) of the support (8) attached to the oscillating bottom nipper (3a) and the other end is hinged to the pin (7) of the eccentric (5), which can swing freely about the top nipper drive shaft (6). The guide sheet (4b) swing the eccentric (5) through an angle and the lap guide plate (4b) assumes the position as shown in Fig.2b, supporting the batt and compensate the slag.<br>
Fig 2a illustrates the extreme forward movement position of the oscillating nipper (3). At this position the distance between the lap feed roller (1) and nipper feed roller (2) increases, and the batt is stretched. By virtue of the fixing arrangement of the lap guide plate (4b), as explained earlier, the lap guide plate (4b) swings the eccentric (5) through an angle opposite to that as compared during the backward movement of the oscillating nipper, and the lap guide plate assumes the position as shown in Fig.2a, and supports the batt. The embodiment as explained above facilitate the movement of the lap stretch compensator guide plate (4b) in synchronization with the<br><br>
forward and backward movement of the oscillating nipper (3) in such a way that the effective length of the batt guide surface is continuously altered and the stretch of the batt delivered to the nipper feed rollers (2) is maintained uniformly throughout the combing cycle.<br>
The lap stretch compensator (4) according to this invention also guide the batt fairy and thereby the air turbulence will not have any impact on the batt.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A lap stretch compensator connected to oscillating nipper (3) of a combing machine comprising a lap feed plate (4a) disposed near lap rollers (K V) of the combing machine for guiding the batt in the region of said lap rollers (1), a lap guide plate (4b) having a first end (4bl) connected to an eccentric (5) by means of a hinge (11) and pin (7) and a second end (4b2) connected to the oscillating nipper (3) by means of a fork (10) and pin (9) for facilitating alteration of the effective length of the batt traveling over it and thus avoid slackness or overstretching of the batt delivered to nipper feed roller and to avoid the influence of the air turbulence over the batt facilitating higher combing cycle rate of at least substantially 200 nips per minute.<br>
