Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a Keyboard for the use with a Brahmi-derived script and a method of adapting a keyboard for a language that uses a Brshmi-derived script.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The Hindi script is a subset of the Devanagari script which in turn evolved from the ancient Brahmi script. Other Indian languages using the Devanagari script include Marathi and Sanslirit. Other scripts derived from Brahmi include: Gujarathi, Oriya, Punjabi (also called Gurmukhi) ; Bengali, Assamese, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam (India); Sinhala (Sri Lanka); Nepali (Nepal- derived from Devanagari); Burmese (Myanmar-Burma) ; Tibetan (Tibet); Laotian (Laos); Thai (Thailand); Khmer (Cambodia); Java, Bali, Batak, Bugis/Buginese (Indonesia) ; and Tagalog (Philippines) Hindi is the official language of India. Most Indian school children are required to study Hindi from an early age. In India there are approximately 200 million native Hindi speakers, while more than 300 million use it as their second language. There are approximately 10 million Hindi speakers outside India, primarily in Nepal.<br>
The Devanagari script includes many more characters than western scripts such as the Roman script for the English language. While Hindi has only 12 vowels and 33 consonants, a language written in Devanagari script, such as Hindi, may include in excess of 550 characters because various phonetic characters are combined into conjunct characters. The large number of characters can make keyboard-entry of Devanagari script burdensome and complicated. Furthermore, this problem is exacerbated by the fact that many languages besides Hindi use the <br><br> Devanagari script (e. g. , Marathi and Sanskrit) and Devanagari-based keyboards may cater to all of them, thereby generating additional complexities.<br>
Existing Hindi keyboard solutions typically focus on making available all or most of the 500+ characters of the Devanagari script. These comprehensive keyboards may involve complexities such as multiple virtual keyboards and multiple keyÂ¬stroke characters. These complexities tend to make existing keyboard solutions<br><br>
difficult to leam and use. For these reasons, keyboards based, for example, on the Inscript layout tend to be difficult to use. Additionally, none of the existing keyboards have the whole script, or even most of it, visible on the keyboard.<br>
A variety of solutions have been proposed with regard to keyboards for use with other languages such as English, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. For example, United States Patent No. 5,836,705 describes a keyboard arrangement to maximize typing speed and data entry and to ease transition from a QWERTY keyboard. This keyboard uses a layout wherein the home keys are assigned according to the frequency of use of the letters.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,945,928 describes a keyboard for the Korean Language. Keys on a keyboard are assigned a plurality of jamos (characters). Additional word processor software analyzes key sequences to resolve ambiguities and determine which characters are intended.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,999,950 describes an on-screen keyboard for the Japanese language. An array of Japanese based Kana characters are displayed. The first selection of a character key causes the display of the character in base kana fonn. The second consecutive selection of the same key causes the display of the character in a variant form. Subsequent consecutive selections cause the display of the character in further variant forms.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,053,647 describes a "user-friendly and efficient keyboaid" for the English language. The keyboard layout places punctuation marks in the center of the keyboard with letters arranged alphabetically on either side of the punctuation marics.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,231,252 describes a downsized keyboard for use '   with the Japanese language. One vowel is assigned to each key of a first key group. Two consonants are assigned to each key in a second key group. An unvoiced consonant is input with a single key-pressmg operation while a voiced consonant is input with a double key-pressing operation.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,275,216 describes a keyboard for entering characters for the Japanese language. One embodiment of the keyboard executes inputting of a character by zero, one, or a plurality of strokes of a code key and sequential stroke of a separator key for selecting a letter.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 6,281,884 describes a user-definable keyboard apparatus for use with the Chinese language. A key may correspond to one or more Chinese character and a character may be assigned to one or more keys. The apparatus may automatically verity that a user-defined keyboard is rational by reference to a character sound grouping rules table.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A user-friendly and efficient keyboard vector which allows a character input system uses a real or virtual keyboard having aplurality of keys, at least some of which are assigned to at least one Brahmi-based script character, such as a Devanagari character, and at least one key being assigned a halant. For simplicity, aspects of the system are described with reference to the Hindi language. However, the keyboard system and method may also be adapted for use with other language scripts that are derived from the Brahmi script.<br>
The vowels of the Hindi script may be grouped together on the keyboard and may be assigned to keys that correspond to the number-row on a standard keyboard. The "vowel signs" or Matras may be accessed by pressing the assigned vowel key with a modifier key (e.g., SHIFT).<br>
In Hindi, the consonants are divided into five Varg subsets and one Non-Varg group. The keyboard may map the five Varg consonant subsets that each '   contain the five phonetically-related consonants. The Varg consonants may be spatially grouped in sets of five in the way they are learned. Keys of each Varg set may be grouped on keys that are adjacent or diagonal to one another on the keyboard. The keys of each Varg may be grouped in a sii^le row on the keyboard. The final Non-Varg consonants may be maped to keys that are grouped together on the keyboard. In one onbodiment, eight non-varg consonants are mapped to a group of eight keys.<br>
In another embodinent, vowel keys are mapped to the Hindi vowels, at least some of the vowel keys being arranged in a row. Initial consonants keys are arranged in a plurality of subsets that include keys that are mapped to a group of phonetically-related Varg consonants, At least some of each subset of initial consonant keys may be arranged on a single row, which may be configured horizontally or in another configuration. Final consonant keys (non-Varg) may also<br><br>
be mapped to Hindi final consonants, and at least some of the final consonant keys may be arranged in a row.<br>
A halant key may be assigned to the halant character to provide a simplified character set, thereby reducing the number of keys and, therefore, the learning curve for the keyboard user.<br>
]n anottier embodiment, a computer system for use with a language using Hindi script includes a processor, a memory system, a graphical user interface, and a Hindi script keyboard. The keyboard may include a plurality of keys, at least some of which are assigned at least one Hindi script character, and at least one key being assigned a halant. The key assignments may be spatially grouped on the keyboard according to phonetic characteristics of the characters.<br>
In another embodiment, a keyboard adapted for use with Hindi script language may include a group of vowel keys each being assigned a Hindi script vowel, the vowel keys comprising keys corresponding to the number-row on a standard keyboard. The Matras may be accessed by pressing the appropriate vowel key with a modifier key (e.g., SHIFT).<br>
The keyboard may also include a first group of phonetically-related consonant keys comprising keys corresponding to Q-W-E-R-T on a standard keyboard. The keyboard may further include a second group of phonetically-related consonant keys comprising keys corresponding to A-S-D-F-G on a standard keyboard. The keyboard may further include a third group of phonetically- related consonant keys comprising keys corresponding to Z-X-C-V-B on a standard keyboard. The keyboard may further include a fourth group of phonetically- related consonant keys comprising keys corresponding to Y-U-I-O-P on a standard keyboard The keyboard may further mclude a fifth group of phonetically- related consonant keys comprising keys corresponding to H-J-K-L-; on a standard keyboard.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodimeot<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the layout for a keyboard 20 includes a subset of characters from the Brahmi-based Devanagari script, specific to Hindi. For convenience, reference will be made to the Hmdi script and alphabet, alftiough die description and keyboard may also be applied to related Brahmi-derived scripts that have similar characteristics.<br>
Other Brahmi-derived Indian scripts include the Northern scripts Marathi, Sanskrit, GujaratJ, Punjabi, Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Manipuri and Southem scripts Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada. Brahmi derived scripts used in languages outside India include Sinhala, Nepali, Burmese, Tibetan, Laotian, Thai, Khmer, Javanese, Bali, Batak, Bugis/BuginesB and Tagalog.<br>
As shown in FIG 1, a portion of the Hindi alphabet may be mapped to the upper ASCn (Gi) character set and the ^propriate keyboard files modified, so that the Hindi script may be directly accessed firom the keyboard. A key, which may be "sticky," may be used to access English. To shnphfy use of the keyboard, a "halant" may be used below leading consonants to type both consonants rather than create all the double letters which exist. This use of a halant is an accepted way to write Hindi, and it immediately cuts the number of Hindi character key locations fi:om in excess of 550 to less than 55. This order of magnitude reduction considerably shortens any learning curve.<br>
An additional software program may be used to run through die inputted material and replace all the halant derived compound characters (e.g., consonantal<br><br>
conjimcts) with traditional coojxmcts from a library. This may be used in real time or at the end of the input sequence.<br>
A standard personal computer keyboard can typically have two sets of characters (Go and Gi) which are accessible by using the SHIFT and/or the CAPS_LOCK keys. A keyboard configured for English does not require use of the second character set (extended ASSCU or the Gi set) because the English alphabet (26 characters) fits on the first character set (the Go set). The Gi set is, however, used by other languages. For example, French, German and the Scandinavian languages use the Gi set for their Umlauts, Diacritic signs, and accents. The G| set is also used with Russian for its Cyrillic alphabet<br>
The keyboard layout shown m FIGS. 1 and 2 includes the Hindi Gi character set. FIG. 2 shows vowel signs (Matras) and additional commonly used conjuncte accessed by the SHIFT key. The standard QWERTY keyboard (i.e., the Go set) may be accessed by another modifier key, e.g., the CAPS_LOCKkey.<br>
A. HINPI VOWELS<br>
The keyboard may include keys mapped to Hindi vowels, as shown ifl Fig. I andS.  The various Brahmi-based Indian script languages generally use up to 18<br>
vowels. Hindi ixses 13 vowels.<br>
In FIG. 1, the 13 vowel characters of Hindi are provided on the top row of the standard keyboard layout (Row 1). On the standard keyboard, this row typically includes the numerals 1 to 9 and 0 as well as other symbols such as the hyphen (-) and equals (=). To simplify use of the keyboard, all the vowels are provided through the keyboard as independent characters. Although the numerals may be di^laced from the number row, the Hindi numerals may be made available on the mmaber keypad, as shown in FIG. I. However, in the majority of cases Roman numbors are used in Hindi (and other Indian languages). Tlie Roman numbors can be accessed using the Go English script.<br>
In addition to vowels, Hindi also includes "vowel signs." A vowel sign is typically represented using a diacritical mark, called a "Matra", which is written above, below, before, or after the consonant to which the vowel belongs. There are a variety of different Matra to signify various vowel sounds.<br><br>
The combination of Hindi consonant characters with the various diacritical vowel markings results in a multiplicity of possible Hindi characters. Mapping the vowel signs to independent keys may drastically reduce the number of keys needed to generate these combinations. As shown in FIG. 2, the Matras (vowel signs) are provided in the first row of the keyboard layout in the Gi character set and are accessed by the SHIFT key + Vowel key. In addition, combination characters may be provided in the Gi character set<br>
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the vowels do not necessarily need to be placed on the number row. For example, in an alternative ranbodiment as shown in FIG. 5, all the vowels could be grouped to the left side of the keyboard and the Varg consonants grouped elsewhere on the keyboard.<br>
B. HINDI CONSONANTS<br>
In FIG. 1, Varg consonants in the Gj character set are arranged in rows Q-'   W-E-R-T,A-S-D-F-G,Z-X-C-V-B,Y-U-I-0-P,H-J-K-L-;andN-M-,-.-/. These rows of 5 characters extend across the keyboard in a horizontal or left-right direction (i.e. on a standard keyboard) in FIG. 1. A row may also be defined in another direction (i.e. 4-R-F-V on a standard keyboard). Commonly used compound consonant characters are shown in the Gi character set in FIG. 2 and may be accessed by pressing the SHIFT key. Other Brahnii derived scripts (e.g., Tamil and Thai) have additional sounds not derived from Brahnii and these may also be accessed using the Shift key.<br>
Hindi consonants may be characterized as "Varg" and "Non-Varg". Varg consonants are arranged in groups of five consonants, as indicated in FIG. 6. The Hindi script includes five Vargs sets (VI, V2, V3, V4, and V5) and a few non-Varg (uncategorized, NV) consonants. The consonants belonging to the five Vargs occupy most of rows R2, R3, and R4. The remaining Devanagari characters in rows R2, R3, and R4 are non-Varg consonants. Additional non-Varg consonants, and a few double characters are included in the Gi character set accessed by the SHIFT key shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a key layout I for Varg 1 is shown. The first two consonants of each Varg constitute the Primary Pair (PP). The second two consonants of each Varg constitute die Secondary Pair (SP). The second consonant<br><br>
of each pair is the aspirated counterpart (has an additional "h" sound) of the first consonant in the pair. The last consonant of the five consonants in a Varg includes a nasal pronunciation.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, the Varg consonants are mapped onto the keyboard layout in a sequential group including, fixim left to right, PP, SP and die fifth consonant. While in FIG. 1 the Vargs appear in horizontal rows, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the consonants of each Varg could be grouped in a different manner than shown in FIG. I. For example, consonants in a Varg could be clustered on keys tiiat are adjacent (e.g. F-G or G-T) or diagonal (e.g. F-V) fixim one another, or grouped onto diagonal rows (e.g. corresponding to keys 4-R-F-V on a standard keyboard.)<br>
Other Details:<br>
1.	The HalanL A "Halant" character allows two or more consonants to be read as a single character. Some portions of Indian society find this "infonnal" scribing technique to be unacceptable because the practice dq)aits fiom official written Hindi. Nonetheless, the Hindi-reading community generally understands and comprehends the technique of using Halants to join Hindi characters.<br>
2.	The Viram. The Hindi fiiU stop (period) may be accessed by SHIFT and /. (FIG.2).<br>
3.	The Anuswar. The Anuswar, a nasal inflection, may be accessed by a Matra key (SHIFT and-) FIG. 2.<br>
4.	The CbandrabindU/ Another nasal inflection may be accessed by a Matra key (SHIFT and') FIG.2.<br>
5.	The Nukta. The Nukta is needed for writing some URDU and Punjabi soimds in Hindi (accessed by \ as shown in FIG. 1).<br>
6.	Compound characters commonly used Hindi: FIG. 2<br><br>
-	'thr'(SHIFT and y)<br>
-	'gya' (SHIFT and d)<br>
-	'shr' (SHIFT and m)<br>
-	*ksh' (SHIFT and *)<br>
-	'om' (SHIFT and a)<br>
-	*IIa' -pronounced hard (SHIFT and,)<br><br>
7.   The half (r) sign is a commonly used one and is mapped to SHIFT and \.<br>
An additional software program may be used to run through the inputted material and replace all the halant derived compoimd characters (e.g., consonantal conjuncts) with traditional conjuncts from a library. This may be used in real time or at the end of the input sequence.<br>
While the keyboard layout of FIGS. 1 and 2 generally avoids the overuse of compound characters {e.g., consonantal conjuncts) to limit the number of characters on ttie keyboard and thereby promote rapid learning and ease of use, commonly used conjuncts may nonetheless be accessed using the SHIFT key (FIG. 2). Additional space exists on the Gj character set using the SHIFT key to either add more compound characters if needed or additional characters (e.g., for Tamil and Thai).<br>
The keyboard may also provide for access to characters in the English alphabet using the Go lower ASCH set. For example, the Go lower ASCII set may be accessed with the CAPS_LOCK key. The SHIFT key + the CAPS_LOCK key may access uppercase Roman alphabet. This feature may be important to users because many Hindi speakers prefer to write in a combination of Hindi and English. In addition, email and many web sites may only be accessed through English-alphabet<br>
addresses.<br>
I<br>
In one embodiment, pressing a particular key makes the English lower case (Go) set available. Pressing another key, which may be a "sticky" key or the SHIFT key, makes English c^itals accessible. In one particular embodiment, pressing the Czqis Lock key makes the English lower case set available and pressing the remapped LEFT_CONTR0L key (or any other unused key) makes the Enghsh i^per case set available. In another particular embodiment, pressing an applet on the desktop makes the English lower case set available and pressing die CAPS^LOOC makes the English upper case set available.<br>
In another embodiment, the key assignments may be spatially grouped on the keyboard according to phonetic characteristics of the characters and ttie way they are learned. In this embodiment, all the vowels and consonants of the Hindi script may be presented on a smgle keyboard. A halant (half-letter) symbol may also be presented. The vowels may be grouped together, and the vowel signs (Matras) may be evoked by SHIFT + Vowel key. The Varg coi^Qnants may be grouped in sets of<br><br>
5, and Vowel diacritic signs ^atras), additional characters and commonly used con^und characters (e.g., consonantal conjuncts) may be evoked by the Shift key.<br>
The keyboard may be used with a personal computer such as an IBMÂ®, CompaqÂ®, DellÂ®, or AppleÂ® MacintoshÂ® personal computer. A personal computer typically includes an operating system such as Windows 95Â®, Windows 98*, Windows MEÂ®, Wmdows NT*, Windows 2000Â®, Windows XPÂ®, Mac OS 7Â®, Max OS S*, Mac OS 9Â®, Mac OS X* or LinuxÂ® software. The keyboard may also be used mtii oflier types of computer systems.<br>
An example of a computer system 30 is shown in Fig. 4. The preferred hardware configuration may include a central processing unit 40, such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units that may be interconnected by a system bus 50. The computer system 30 may also be spread out over one or more interconnected computers or computer systems.<br>
The system may aiso include a Random Access Memory (RAM) 70, Read Only Memory (ROM) 80, and an I/O adapter 90 for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units 100 to the bus 50. A user iutec&amp;ce adapts 110 for connecting several input devices may also be included. Examples of possible input devices electronically coupled to the user interface acUtpter 120 include a keyboard 20, a mouse 130, a speaker 140, a microphone 150, and/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen. A communication adapter 160 may be included for connecting the system to a communication network link 170. A gr^hical user interface 180 may also be coupled to the system bus 50 and provides the connection to a display device 190. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art dial the mouse 130 may be a typical mouse as known in the industry, or alternatively a similar device such as a trackball, light pen, or the like. The system may be configured to use a real keyboard or a virtual keyboard, such as an on-screen keyboard.<br>
The keyboard system and method may be used with most popular existing operating systems. A small program may be distributed either by floppy, CDROM or downloadable fi-om the web to provide the functionality and instructions for malting and using Hindi characters on a standard keyboard.<br>
To implement the keyboard system and method widi the XWINDOW deslaop system (e.g., UnixÂ®, LiniucÂ®, SolarisÂ® etc.), two XMM files (one for English and one for Hindi) may be invoked by two desktop applets. An editor (e.g., gedit)<br><br>
may be accessed to type documents. Other application software may also be accessed â for example NetscapeÂ® in Hindi which provides a web browser, an email client and allows the compositioa of simple HTML web pages.<br>
An additional software program may be used to run through the inputted material and replace all the halant derived compound chaiaeters (e.g., consonantal conjuncts) witii traditional conjuncts from a library. This may be used in real time or at the end of the input sequence.<br>
To implement the keyboard system and method with Microsoft Windows operating system, a separate TrueType font (TTF) file of Hmdi character set may be mvoked because Microsoft Windows, by design, does not generally allow low-level access to the keyboard. The Microsoft Windows driver may be a stand alone program running on the Microsoft Windows platfoim which includes fonts, a .DLL file, an executable, a splash screen etc. When activated and the Hindi font is chosen, the driver may provide both Hindi and English fimctionaUty on a standard keyboard. Any key that is not assigned a Hindi character may be used to switch between Hindi and English.<br>
An additional software program, specific to Microsoft Windows, may be used to nin through the inputted material and replace all the halant derived compound characters (e.g., consonantal conjuncts) with traditional conjuncts from a library. This may be used in real time or at the end of the input sequence.<br>
The keyboard method and system may employ Unicode or the ISCII standard to uniquely code the script characters. Unicode allows all the combinations in all Indian languages to have a unique hex code. Hiese hex codes may be generated by a keyboaid BIOS- Externally, the keyboard may have the same encoding vector.<br>
While the embodunent shown in FIGS. 1 to 4 is configured for Hindi, the keyboard system and method can be easily ad^ted for related languages that use tiie Devanagari script or are derived from the Brahmi script of ancient India. For example, Devanagari script is also used to write Sanskrit, Nepali, Konlcani, and Marathi. In addition, most of the other officially recognized Indian languages (Bengali, Telegu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, Manipuri) derive tiieir scripts from the Brahmi script. This general ^proach may also be used for non-Indian languages using Brahmi derived scripts<br><br>
(Sinhala, Nepali, Burmese, Tibetan, Laotian, Thai, Khmer, Javanese, Bali, Batak, Bugis/Buginese and Tagalog).<br>
While these languages differ significantly from Hindi in syntax and grammar and the scripts may differ significantly in shape and combinations, the nunber of vowels and consonants are in the same ball-park range as Hindi. As a result, the keyboard embodiment shown may be adapted for use with all these languages. The keyboard method and system may have similar encoding vectors for vowels and consonants for all the official Indian languages. Because each these languages may be assigned a unique Unicode hex code, it is also straightforward to make Unicode keyboards for these other languages.<br>
As shown by FIGS 1,2 and 5, the key concepts are not the assignm^t of particular characters to particular keys, but rather the majority of the alphabets of a particular language displayed and grouped according to vowels, related consonants and the manner in which the characters are learned. Because the keyboard is based on assigning characters to keys of a standard keyboard, it is not necessary to build a specialized keyboard for use with the Hindi script and for other language scripts derived from Brahmi.<br>
Glossary of Terminology:<br>
Anuswar: A dot above the character' D ' representing a nasal sound, Brahmi script: This elegant script apeared in India most certainly by the 5th century BC, but just like the Greek alphabet, it has many local variants, which suggests that its origin lies further back in time. It is in this script that the ancient Indian king Asoka inscribed his laws onto monumental columns. The Brahmi script was the ancestor of all Indian writing systems, including the Devanagari. In addition, many Asian scripts, such as Burmese, Thai, Tibetan and even Je^anese to a very small extent (vowel order), were also derived from Indian script Thus the Brahmi script was the lodian equivalent of the Greek script fi-om which many different scripts originated.<br><br><br><br>
Go and G1 character sets: The first 128 characters in the ASCII 8-bit encoding<br>
scheme are referred to as the lower (Go) character set. These typically code the lower<br>
and upper case Roman English alphabet. The remaining character set space (upper<br>
character set, extended ASCII character set or Gi set) are not used in English but are<br>
used to code special additional characters e.g., umlauts in Gennan, accented French<br>
characters or the Cyrillic alphabet of the Russian language.<br>
Halant: This is a sign (an oblique dash) below the leading character of a pair<br>
(usually consonants) which signifies a conjunct of the two characters. This is an<br>
accepted way of joining 2 consonants instead of using an additional unique<br>
character. This cuts down the number of keys by an order of magnitude.<br>
Inscript keyboard layout: The official Indian language keyboard encoding vector<br>
which encodes the whole Devanagari script. This includes Hindi, Marathi and<br>
Sanskrit languages.<br>
ISCn (INDIAN SCRIPT CODE FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE) is an<br>
encoding method which allows unique codes for all Indian script characters. It is<br>
essentially a subset of the Unicode standard.<br>
Keyboard Encoding Vector: The order in which the letters of a script are arranged<br>
on the keyboard<br>
Matra: This is a vowel diacritic sign,<br>
Nukta:this is the dot below, i.e., "."-it is used forderiving other characters in<br>
Devanagari, Punjabi and when Urdu is written using Devanagari.<br>
Cm: A commonly used Hindu religious symbol.<br>
Script: A complete set of characters used for the written form of one or more<br>
languages, e.g., the Roman script for the English Language, i.e., a,b, c....x,y,z.<br>
Vargs: These are the initial consonants phonetically groi^ied in 5's. There are 5<br>
such Varg groups of consonants. Additional, final consonants are the Non-Varg<br>
consonants (8 in Hindi).<br>
Viram: This is a full stop sign in Hindi (1). Verse endings in Sanskrit use a double<br>
Viram (1 I).<br>
Visarg: Comes after a vowel and represents the 'h' sound. In Tamil this represents<br>
the Aytham '.". * sound.<br>
