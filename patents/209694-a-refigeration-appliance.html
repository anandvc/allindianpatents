COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"AGASKET ARRANGEMENT-FQR THE CABINET DOOR OF A FEFFTGFFATION APPLIANCE"<br><br><br><br>
MULTIBRAS S.A. ELETRODOMESTICOS, a Brazilian company, of Avenida das Nacoes Unidas, 12995, 32 andar, CEP-04578-000-Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a refrigeration appliance.<br>
The present invention refers to a gasket arrangement<br>
to be used for sealing the door of refrigeration<br>
appliances, such as refrigerators and freezers of the<br>
type  in  which  the  cabinets  and  the  doors  are<br>
. respectively provided with an inner box and an inner<br>
panel constructed in a molded plastic material of<br>
reduced thermal conductivity and affixed to an outer<br>
 wall or panel constructed in metallic plate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The  cabinets  for  the  refrigeration  appliances considered herein usually consist of a surrounding outer wall, in metallic plate, to which is coupled an inner box, which is usually molded in polystyrene or similar material of reduced thermal conductivity, and whose peripheral edge is seated and affixed against the free edge of a peripheral front flange of the surrounding outer wall, said front flange  projecting orthogonal to the inside of the cabinet, in order to define a peripheral portion of the front face of said cabinet. Against said front face peripheral portion is seated a sealing gasket carried by the cabinet door, which is also made of an outer panel in metallic plate, incorporating a surrounding peripheral wall and a peripheral flange, to which is affixed the sealing gasket. To the outer panel is affixed an inner panel which is also usually molded in polystyrene or similar material.<br>
Between the surrounding outer wall and the inner box of the cabinet and between the inner and outer panels of the door is provided a thermal insulating filler in polyurethane.<br><br><br>
In this type of construction, the front wall of the cabinet is defined by the peripheral front flange of the outer wall, forming an integral part therewith and extending by a width sufficient to define a seating surface for the sealing gasket and a fixation surface for the peripheral  edge of the  inner box of the cabinet, said peripheral front flange acting as a heat conducting element, conducting heat from the outside to the inside of the refrigerated cabinet. The  same operational  deficiency of  the prior art construction occurs in relation to the peripheral rear flange of the outer panel of the door.  Said rear flange has a width sufficient to affix the sealing gasket and the peripheral edge of the inner panel, thus  also  acting  as  a  heat  conducting  element, conducting heat to the inside of the cabinet. It should be observed that the width of the front and rear peripheral flanges is superior to the width of the sealing gasket,  making their marginal portions, which are going to be coupled to the inner box and to the inner panel,  respectively, be positioned inside the refrigerated environment which has been sealed by the gasket.<br>
It is known in the art that the penetration of heat into the refrigerated cabinet occurs not only by the sealing gasket itself, but also and mainly by the region in which it is installed, i.e., by the front peripheral flange of the cabinet and by the rear peripheral flange of the door which are constructed in metallic plate and in direct contact with the environment external to the refrigerated cabinet. Typical values for the penetration of heat into the region of the sealing gasket reach about 20% the total penetration of heat (thermal load) into the inside of the cabinet.<br><br><br>
Considering that most of the heat that penetrates into the cabinet is conducted through said metallic flanges operatively associated with the gasket, the replacement of the elastomeric material, which is generally used for said gasket, by an insulating material, will therefore lead to a relatively low gain in. terms of reducing the penetration of heat into the refrigerated environment. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a, gasket arrangement for the cabinet door of a refrigeration appliance, such as a refrigerator or freezer, which allows, by a simple construction and without requiring alteration in the design of any of the parts of the refrigeration appliance, to attain a relevant reduction in the penetration of heat into the refrigerated environment.<br>
The objective mentioned above  is  achieved by the provision of a refrigeration appliance of the type considered herein and provided with a sealing gasket, which is  operatively associated with a peripheral portion of  the  rear face of  the  door and to a peripheral portion of the front face of the cabinet. According to the invention,  the gasket arrangement further comprises at least one additional gasket, in elastomeric material of reduced thermal conductivity, which is provided internal to the sealing gasket and which is affixed to one of the parts defined by the inner panel of the door and by the inner box of the cabinet and to be seated to the other of said parts upon  closing  the door.<br>
With the new constructive arrangement, which is preferably obtained by the simple application of a cord of elastomeric material of the hot melt type, for example .to  the  inner box of  the  cabinet,  it  is<br>
4<br><br><br>
possible to form a heat insulating barrier between the<br>
environment immediately internal to the sealing gasket<br>
and in contact with the marginal portions of the<br>
metallic  flanges  operatively  associated  with  said<br>
sealing gasket and the internal environment of the<br>
refrigerated cabinet, minimizing the heat transfer to<br>
the  inside of said cabinet  through said metallic<br>
flanges.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
The invention will be described below, with reference<br>
to the appended drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified partial cross-sectional view<br>
of  a  cabinet-door  assembly  of  a  refrigeration<br>
appliance provided with the gasket arrangement of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
As already mentioned above and illustrated in the<br>
appended drawing, the present gasket arrangement is<br>
applied   to   refrigeration   appliances,   such   as<br>
refrigerators and freezers having a cabinet G,  and<br>
formed by a surrounding outer wall 10 in metallic<br>
plate and incorporating a peripheral front flange 11,<br>
to whose marginal portion is seated and affixed the<br>
peripheral edge of an inner box 20, which is usually<br>
molded in polystyrene • or other material of reduced<br>
thermal conductivity.<br>
Between the surrounding outer wall 10 and the inner<br>
box 2 0 is provided a heat insulator in the form of a<br>
filler 30, for example in polyurethane.<br>
The cabinet G is usually closed at the front by at<br>
least one door p, which is conveniently made of an<br>
outer panel  40  in metallic plate,  incorporating a<br>
peripheral rear flange 41, to whose marginal portion<br>
is seated and affixed the peripheral edge of an inner<br>
panel 50 usually molded in polystyrene. The inside of<br><br><br>
the door P also comprises a filler 30, such as that used in the cabinet G.<br>
This prior art construction further has a sealing gasket 60, usually made of an elastomeric material and affixed to the peripheral rear flange 41 of the door P, ' so as to be seated against the peripheral front flange 11 of the cabinet G. Both the front and the rear peripheral flanges 11 and 41 have a width usually superior to that of the sealing gasket 60. According  to  the  invention,  the  present  gasket arrangement comprises at least one additional .gasket 80,  in elastomeric material and of reduced thermal conductivity,   such   as   for   example,   expanded polyurethane, which is usually affixed to the inner box 20 of the cabinet G, in an internal region in relation to the sealing gasket 60 and dimensioned to be seated against the inner panel 50 of the door P, when the latter is closed.  It should be understood that the additional gasket 80 may be affixed to either the inner box 2 0 or to the inner panel 50,  said fixation causing no alteration in its function of creating  at  least  one  additional  thermal  barrier between the marginal portions of the front and rear peripheral  flanges 11 and 41 and the refrigerated environment of the cabinet G.<br>
The additional gasket 8 0 may be provided by applying, for example, a cord made of expanded polyurethane of the hot melt type directly to the surface of the inner box 20 or the inner panel 50. The application of the polyurethane-based cord, for example by extrusion, may be carried out without any previous alteration in the design of the plastic internal parts of the refrigeration appliance or inside a respective housing (not illustrated) provided in the inner box 20 or in<br><br><br><br>
the inner panel 50, in order to avoid shear forces in the material of the gaskets.<br>
The reduction of the thermal load, in the refrigeration Appliance obtained with the new arrangement has the Advantage of reducing the internal temperature of the Cabinet and increasing energy saving, besides making possible to use a refrigeration system with lower Capacity.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A refrigeration appliance comprising a cabinet (G) having a surrounding outer wall (10) in metallic plate affixing an inner box (20) in a material of reduced thermal conductivity; a respective door (P) having an outer panel (40) in metallic plate affixing an inner panel (50) in a material of reduced thermal conductivity; a seeking gasket (60), which is operatively associated with a peripheral rear flange (41) of the outer panel (40) and with a peripheral front flange (11) of the surrounding outer wall (10); and one additional gasket (80) in elastomeric material of reduced thermal conductivity, which is affixed, to one of the parts defined by the inner panel (50) of the door (P) and by the inner box (20) of the cabinet (G), internal to the sealing gasket (60), and which is seated to the other of said parts upon closing of the door (P), characterized in that the additional gasket (80) is obtained from a chord of elastomeric material, the chord of a elastomeric material being extruded directly onto the surface that will carry it.<br>
2.	The refrigeration appliance as claimed in claim 1, wherein the additional gasket (80) is affixed inside a housing provided on the surface to which it is affixed.<br><br>
