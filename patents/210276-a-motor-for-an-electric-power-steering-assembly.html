The present invention relates to a motor for an electric power steering assembly for assisting the steering force of an automotive steering wheel. 2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-section of the internal construction of an electric power steering assembly (hereinafter "electric motor" described in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 2000-224822, and Figure 6 is an enlargement of part of Figure 5.<br>
The electric motor includes: a cylindrical yoke (not shown); four permanent magnets (not shown) composed of ferrite spaced circumferentialiy and secured inside the yoke; a shaft 4 disposed inside the yoke by means of bearings so as to be able to rotate freely; an armature 5 secured to the shaft 4; a commutator 7 comprising a plurality of segments 6 secured to an end portion of the shaft 4; four brushes (not shown) spaced equidistantly and placed in contact with the surface of the commutator 7 by the elastic force of springs (not shown); and an equalizer main body 10 secured to the shaft 4 between the armature 5 and the commutator 7.<br>
The armature 5 includes: a core 12 having twenty-two slots 11 extending in the axial direction; and a winding 14 constructed by winding wiring 13 into the slots 11 by a lap winding method.<br>
The equalizer main body 10 is assembled by alternately stacking terminals 16, which are eleven equalizing members, and composed of copper plate or the like, with eleven insulating plates 17 on a basils composed of phenolic resin.<br>
Each of the terminals 16 has a pair of equalizing portions 16a extending radially outwards in opposite directions. The equalizing portion 16a is bent along a hook 18 and electrically connected with the hook 18 at a total of twenty-two places such that those segments 6 which should have equal electric potential with each other are connected through the terminal 16.<br><br>
Figure 7 is a set of diagrams and graphs of magnetic attraction and torque ripples acting on an armature 5 having four poles, a lap winding, and twenty-two slots which the present inventors obtained by magnetic field analysis.<br>
As can be seen from the figure, in the case of a 22-slot lap-wound armature, the total magnetic attraction acting on the armature is also zero and operating noise due to rotational vibrations does not arise.<br>
Figure 8 is a moss-section of the intemal construction of another conventional electric motor. Parts that are similar or correspond to those shown in Fig. 5 described above will be assigned like reference numerals.<br>
The electric motor 20 comprises: a cylindrical yoke 1; four permanent magnets 2 composed of ferrite spaced circumferentially and secured inside the yoke 1; a first bearing 22 housed within a bearing housing portion 21, a shaft 4 disposed inside the yoke 1, one end of the shaft 4 supported by means of a first bearing 22 so as to be able to rotate freely; an armature 5 secured to the shaft 4; a commutator 7 secured to an end portion of the shaft 4, four banishes 9 placed in contact with the surface of the commutator 7 by the elastic force of springs 8; a brush holder 23 holding the brush 9, a housing 25 fastened to the yoke 1 by means of a screw 24, a second bearing 26 secured to the center portion of the housing 25. supporting another end portion so as to be able to rotate freely,' a boss 27 secured to the end portion of the shaft 4, and a grommet 29 wherein a lead wire 28 passes through the grommet.<br>
The armature 5 comprises: a core 12 having twenty-two slots 11 extending in the axial direction; and a winding 14 constructed by winding wiring into the slots by a lap winding method.<br>
Further, equalizing members (not shown) connect those segments 6 which should have equal electric potential with each other. That is, one end portion of the equalizing member is engaged at a hook 18 of the segment 6, another end portion of the equalizing member passes through a slot of the core 12, extends as far as the end face of the core 12 without the commutator 7, and then makes a U-tom at the<br><br>
end face, passes through another slot, extends as far as the hook 18 of the segment, and is finally engaged at the hook 18.<br>
In the case of lap winding, there are problems in that differences arise in the electromotive forces induced among the circuits of the winding 14 of the armature 5 due to the influence of imbalances in the electromagnetic circuit of the yoke, eccentricities in the armature 5, nonunform electric currents flowing through the brushes 9, engineering errors, etc, giving rise to circulating currents within the armature 5 flowing through the brushes 9. As a result, the commutating action of the brushes deteriorates, leading to increases in temperature, shortened   life, in eases in torque ripples in the brushes 9 and the commutator 7 which accompany an unease in commutation   generated by the brushes 9, as well as the combined effects thereof, thereby in easing operating noise.<br>
The first conventional electric motor described above is provided with the terminal 16 and the second conventional electric motor described above is provided with the equalizing member to prevent the above problem.<br>
As can be seen from figure 7, in the case of a 4--pole 22-slot lap-wound armature, torque ripples (peak to peak or p-p) represented by the ratio of vertical variance in the torque wave to the total torque are 0.876 percent, the valuator the torque ripples (p-p) is comparatively smaller. However, the armature 5 vibrates due to torque ripples, and   this vibration creates operating noise.<br>
Further, in the case of both conventional electric motors, there is a problem that collision noise arises due to impact between the first bearing 22 and the yoke 1, the vibration from the impact is transferred to the yoke 1, and the housing 25, thereby increasing noise.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is aimed at solving the above problems and an object of the present invention is to provide a motor for an electric power steering assembly that allows operating noise to be reduced.<br><br>
To this end, according to the present invention, there is provided a motor for an electric power steering assembly includes: an armature secured to a shaft having a winding constructed by lap winding wiring into twenty-two slots formed on an outer circumferential surface of a core so as to extend in the axial direction thereof, a commutator comprising a plurality of segments secured to an end portion of the shaft; an equalizing member connecting those of the segments that should have equal electric potential with each other; a second bearing disposed to an end of the shaft where a steering force of a steering is transmitted; and a first bearing disposed at the other end of the shaft, housed within a bearing housing portion of the yoke. A collision prevention member is provided between an outer ring of the first bearing and the bearing housing portion, the collision prevention member prevents the outer ring from colliding against the bearing housing portion.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a motor for an electric power steering assembly includes: an armature secured to a shaft having a winding constructed by lap winding wiring into twenty-two slots formed on an outer drcumferential surface of a core so as to extend in the axial direction thereof; a commutator comprising a plurality of segments secured to an end portion of the shaft; an equalizing member connecting those of the segments that should have equal electric potential with each other; and a second bearing disposed to an end of the shaft where a steering force of a steering is transmitted.
