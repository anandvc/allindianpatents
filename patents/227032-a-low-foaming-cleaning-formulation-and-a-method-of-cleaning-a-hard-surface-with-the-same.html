Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to cleaning apptications that require low foam or non-foam cleaning formulations such as in automatic dishwashers. Cleaning in Place (CIP), automatic floor scmbbers, enclosed parts cleaning and the like. Any foam that is generated in these systems should be unstable and break down rapidly to prevent accumulation of foam during the process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Typical hard surfece cleaning formulations consist of a nonionic surfactant or solvent component, an electi-olyte component (chelates or builders) and a hydrotropic co-surfactant (amphoteric, anionic or cationic surfactants). Quaternary ammonium compounds can function as the hydrotropic co-surfactants.<br>
In the cleaning industry there are several specialized categories of cleaning where foaming can be very detrimental to tiie application. Examples of such formulations include Cleaning In Place formulations, automatic floor scrubber formulations, automatic dishwasher formulations, re-circulatory metal parts cleaning and the like. These types of formulations demand low, fast breaking foams to avoid overflow, product loss, pump cavitation, and streaks/films on treated surfaces after drying. If the cleaning formulation shows any tendency to foam then the high turbulence caused by either brushes or water sprays will result in foam.<br><br>
In order to address the foaming issues, formulators often add oils or silicon defoamers to reduce or eliminate foam. Often these additives leave films and deposits on the surface, resulting in a poorly cleaned surface. Secondly at high concentrations of alkaline salts, such as in aqueous concentrates in which typically the cleaning compositions are supplied to the end user, these additives are not soluble.<br>
Formulators also use low foam or defoaming nonionic surfactants in these cleaning fonnulations to minimize foam. Examples include EO/PO block copolymers, branched alcohol ethoxylates, capped alcohol ethoxylates and the like. However, the addition of hydrotropes or hydrotropic co-surfactants that couple the electrolytic component and the low foam/defoam nonionic component together can result in foam stabilization, foam addition or foam boosting negating the effect of the low foaming or defoaming nonionic. This has resulted in many fomiulators avoiding the use of hydrotropes in their cleaning fonnulations. Additionally, these cleaning formulations have the lowest foam profile when the cleaning is done at temperatures above the formulations cloud points which results in cleaning solutions that are unstable and inefficient. Also, these fonnulations tend to have depletion problems especially in enclosed re-circulator systems. This requires that the nonionic surfactant be replenished in order to prevent flash foam occun^ence.<br>
The present invention has solved the deficiencies of the prior art by providing low foaming and/or defoaming formulations, which comprise an alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compound and at least one nonionic compound of a specific structure.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to low foaming and/or defoaming cleaning formulations which comprise a synergistic combination of one or more hydrotropic alkoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds and at least one nonionic surfactant based on branched alcohols. The nonionic surfactant may be selected from stnjctures having 3 to 12 moles of ethoxylation, but preferably have an average of 3-6 moles of ethoxylation with either narrow or broad range distribution.<br>

To demonstrate the above invention, cleaning formulations with the following ingredients were prepared:<br>
Formulation A<br>
7%	EDTA (40% solution of sodium salt)<br>
4%	TKPP<br>
2.5%	Nonionic (may be varied from 0.5 to 4%)<br>
6%	Hydrotrope (or X amount until clear and stable)<br>
The test fomiulations were diluted 1:10 with distilled water and 100 ml samples were placed into the blender. The test solutions were blended for 60 sec at 1600 rpm and decanted into a measuring cylinder. The foam volume was determined initially, then after intervals of 1 and 5 minutes. The collapse rate was determined by taking the initial foam volume and dividing it by the time in seconds that it took to reach zero foam. If foam was still present at five minutes, the final foam volume was subtracted from initial volume and divided by 300 seconds. This test method was chosen to demonstrate the stability of any foam generated by the cleaning fonnulation under mechanical agitation.<br><br>
The rnfiuence of nonionic surfactant type, hydrotrope type and variations of Berol CHLF structure on the collapse rate of the cleaning fomiula was studied. Also, the percentage of nonionic in the fomnulation w/as varied to detemnine its contribution to collapse rate.<br>

The above results show that the Berol CHLF alone in this fonnulation has a collapse rate of -1.6 ml/sec {average of five batches, values range from 1.2-2.1 ml/sec). When this hydrotrope was combined with various low foam nonionic surfactants in the majority of the cases the collapse rate drops to -0.5<br><br>
mi/sec or less. However, when Berol CHLF was combined with Berol 840 the collapse rate increased by three-fold to ~6 ml/sec (average of five batches values range from 4.7-8.7 ml/sec). However, combination of Berol 840 with a traditional hydrotope such as sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS) results in a boost of foam volume and a reduction in collapse rates, due to foam stabilization, as seen in Table 2. The other two nonionic surfactants tested show no significant change in foam stability or amount of foam generated based on hydrotrope selected.<br>

Adjusting the atkoxylated cationic hydrotrope structure by varying the EO/PO content or the counter ion preserves the rapid collapse rate seen with Berol CHLF and Berol 840 formulations (Table 3). Use of more traditional hydrotropes results in the decline in ihe collapse rate of the cleaning formulations, even when a low foam hydrotrope such as Ampholak YJH-40<br><br>
was used. The above-data suggest that propoxylation in the aikoxyiated group is a critical factor in foam collapse behavior.<br>

Adjusting the nonionlc surfectant type in the fonnulation indicates that two moles of EO on the 2-ethylhexanol was not sufficient to provide rapid defoaming such as seen with higher ethoxyiates (Berol 840). However, the<br><br>
distribution of the ethoxylation, a result of process conditions, does not affect the defoaming ability of the ethoxylated 2-ethylhexyi in these formulations. This is illustrated with the 2-ethylhexyl plus 5 moles EO based formulation, which gave results similar to the Berol 840 based fomiulation. 2-ethylhexyl plus 5 moles EO is produced by traditional ethoxylation techniques that produce a broad distribution of EO. Berol 840 is processed under conditions that result In a nan-ow distribution of EO as seen in Table 4. Slightly higher Guerbet alcohol based nonionlcs such as 2-propylheptyl with 5 moles of EO exhibit the same behavior as 2-ethylhexyi. However, longer Guerbet alcohols like 2-butyloctyl do not behave in the same manner with the Berol CHLF in these formulations.<br>
Higher levels of ethoxylation cause a decrease in the defoaming rate as illustrated by the use of 2-ethylhexyl plus eight mole of ethoxylate, which gives a collapse rate similar to the formulation with just the Berol CHLF. Screening results for other types of nonionlcs surfectants with various alkyl groups, HLBs, moles of EO and ethoxylation type can also be seen in Table 4. Branched alkyl groups other than short Guerbet alcohols do not provide the same rapid foam collapse. Linear fetty alkyl chains do not boost the collapse rate, but in general as the chain length decreases, the influence on collapse rate of the Berol CHLF decreases. Capping of the ethoxylate does not appear to affect the collapse rate, as seen with the benzyl methyl capped nonionic in Table 4.<br>
The amount of nonionic has a dramatic impact on the collapse rate of this fomiulation type as can be seen in Figure 1. As the amount of Berol 840 increases the collapse rate of the formulation increases. The collapse rate dramatically increases above 2% nonionic and it reaches a maximum between about 2.5% and 3.5% Berol 840. However, the opposite trend was seen with two other branched low foaming nonionic tested. Both Novel H 12-4 and T-Det<br><br>
A134 nonionic surfactants show a decrease in collapse rate as the amount of nonionic was increased in the test formulations. The results are in Table 5.<br>

Cleaning Performance<br>
Test solutions of cleaning Formulation A were prepared with three nonionic surfactants with two being known degreasers as shown in Table 6. These test formulations were diluted 1:10 with distilled water and their ability to degrease<br><br>
a real world soil (greasy/oily soil obtained from train engines) was detenmined using the method described below. The results indicated that the combination of Berol CHLF with Berol 840 gives statistically similar cleaning to both Berol 260 and T-DET A-134 both of which are considered excellent degreasers.<br>

Two formulations were compared using the Formulation B-t and Formulation Bz shown below. The foaming and cleaning ability of these two surfactant systems were compared as described previously. Fonnulation Bi combines 3.5% Berol 840 and 6% Berol CHLF and Fonnulation Bz contains 9.5% Versilan MX332 (Akcros) with the same builders. Versilan MX332 has been described as a low foam cleaning surfactant blend recommended for metal cleaning. Versilan MX332 low foaming character is dependent on temperature as shown in Table 7. Results indicate that the combination of Berol 840/Berol CHLF was at least eight time more effective at degreasing under non-mechanical conditions than Versilan MX332.<br><br>

Time to zero foam was 67 seconds and at 130°F the time was 240 seconds. The results also indicate that the combination of Berol 840 and Berol CHLF generate very unstable foam at low temperatures and significantly lower foam volumes at higher temperature with slightly more stable foam. The fon-nulation containing Versilan MX332 has a small reduction in foam volume Uiat appears to be quite stable after an initial decline. The formulation containing Versilan<br><br>
MX332 also shows less stability than the combination of Berol 840 and Berol CHLF.<br>

The soil is transferred by a shallow pan and allowed to air-dry. Once the soil is completely dry it is pulverized and passed through a 300 mesh screen.<br>
Equipment<br>
1.	100 ml and 25 ml Pyrex beakers<br>
2.	Spectrophotometer or reflectometer (any instrument capable of accurately measuring changes in substrates reflectance, such as Minolta CM-508D spectrophotometer)<br>
3.	1 inch paint bnjsh<br>
4.	Aerosol sprayer<br>
5.	Sink with a water spray nozzle<br><br>
6.     1 X 140 X 220 mm steel plates, which were primed, painted (white) plus two coats of lacquer, not unlike a car surface.<br>
Propedures<br>
1. The panels are washed with detergent, then cleaned with IPA and allowed to dry<br>
before use. 2- The spectrophotometer is placed on the marked sections and a base reading is<br>
taken (marked as MB. ABB or Abs - the base reading),<br>
3.	If required the synthetic soil is prepared as stated above or a real World soil sample is selected for the test<br>
4.	The real World soil is applied on to tfie test panel with a brush, then the soil is smoothed over the surface to obtain an even coating as possible using a Kimwipe. If using the Synthetic soil, the soil is sprayed across the test panel once using an aerosol sprayer, once the IPA has evaporated off the surface a second coat is applied. The plates are then allowed to stand for 12 hour before testing.<br>
5.	The spectrophotometer is placed on the marked sections of the soiled panels and the soiled reading is taken (marked as ALs, Aas or Abg - the soiled reading).<br>
6.	100 mis of the test solutions are prepared and the solution is diluted between 1:10 to 1:120 with distilled/deionized water.<br>
7.	Twenty ml of each diluted test cleaner is poured onto the soiled plate (three solutions per plate). Oneach test plate twenty mis of the control solution at 1:10 dilution is tested and used as a reference for product/plate performance.<br>
8.	The test solution is left for twenty seconds. The plates are then cleaned using a low-pressure water spray. The plates are cleaned from the bottom up to remove the emulsified dirt.<br>
9.	The panels are allowed to air dry. The spectrophotometer is placed on the marked sections and the final reading is taken (marked as ALc, Aac or Abe - the cleaned reading).<br><br>
10.	The Delta values are used to calculated the amount of soil removed from the<br>
