				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a multipurpose ready-to-use high-protein soy<br>
granules obtained from texturised vegetable protein and a process for preparing the<br>
same.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
The demand for high protein foods is a well-known fact in which several protein<br>
sources are used of which major contribution arises from plant sources. The<br>
technological advances concerning the creation of a new texture particularly using<br>
soybean protein have lead to the development of texturised vegetable protein (TVP)<br>
or texturised plant protein (TPP) or meat analogue or soya chunk which basically<br>
formed the man made food popularly known as fabricated foods or engineering<br>
foods. The use of an extruder under appropriate pressure-shear-temperatures<br>
combination yields a product that is fibrous in nature, filamentary in structure, and<br>
toughness and chewy texture of meat. This whole process is called thermoplastic<br>
extrusion. The advantages of this technology lie in low product cost mainly because<br>
the raw material to be used is defatted soy flour that is low in cost. In addition, the<br>
abundance of defatted soy flour in concert with technological advantages of<br>
extrusion cooking have made this type of product popular among several types of<br>
people including those who can hardly afford the high cost of animal protein.<br>
The thermoplastic extrusion process involves the preparation of defatted soy flourwater<br>
mixture along with other ingredients followed by feeding the mixture into a<br>
cooking extruder wherein it is subjected to heat, shear and pressure. When this<br>
cooked viscoelastic mass comes out of a restriction, conventionally known as die,<br>
the fibrous expanded structure is formed which solidifies to hard texture on cooling or<br>
drying. On rehydration and cooking, the fibrous TVP can provide a texture/bite and a<br>
mouthfeel comparable to cooked meat. It may be mentioned here that the process of<br>
producing TVP and similar products are covered under several patents that are<br>
discussed in the subsequent sections.<br>
References may be made to an US patent 3911157 (1975) in which claims have<br>
been on a process for preparing texturised vegetable protein from non-textured<br>
vegetable materials. The process comprises forming a dough from a source of<br>
vegetable protein and water; roll milling the dough to a sheet thickness of 18 mils or<br>
less to effect cellular disruption and expose coagulable protein molecules; and<br>
cooking the sheeted protein at from 180 to 300°F in the presence of a non-drying<br>
atmosphere of moist steam. The texturized protein is especially adapted to use as an<br>
extender for comminuted meat items.<br>
References may be made to a British patent GB2108511 (1983) in which a process<br>
for low-cost texturised vegetable protein has been described. A textured protein<br>
product having a protein content of up to 80% is produced by mixing soy meal (grits,<br>
flakes or flour) with water containing a protein insolubilizing agent to prepare a<br>
homogeneous mass; forming from said mass discrete pieces of a desired<br>
configuration under temperature and pressure conditions which retain the proteins in<br>
the undenatured state and retain the protein in carbohydrate molecules thereof<br>
substantially in the original matrix relationship of the starting material; and cooking<br>
the pieces in water in order (1) to denature the proteins in situ whereby contiguous<br>
protein molecules interlock to form a three dimensional network structure throughout<br>
each of the pieces, and (2) to leach out soluble carbohydrates from within the protein<br>
structure.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent US4369195 (1983) in which extrusion<br>
texturization of full-fat soybean and products thereof have been described. A<br>
textured soybean product is produced from full-fat soybean by hydrating whole<br>
soybean by treatment with a dilute alkaline solution; mixing the hydrated soybean<br>
with full-fat soy flour and equilibrating the moisture content thereof; and passing the<br>
mixture through an extrusion cooker. The textured product has excellent flavor, color,<br>
and appearance, and can be formulated into an all-vegetable ground meat analogue<br>
or it can be used as an extender in blends with ground meat.<br>
The drawbacks of TVP are that they ^ot in the ready-to-eat form as it is<br>
m&amp; -atory to cook the same prior tc . ption. Sometimes, even t -.ydrcted<br>
TVPs offer a too hard or chewy texture that is undesirable from the point of<br>
consumer acceptability.<br>
References may be made to a European patent EP0517458 (1992) wherein claim<br>
has oeen made for a process for the production of a protein granule suitable for use<br>
as a meat extender using a vegetable protein isolate as the raw material. The isolate<br>
is nyarated to a ratio of 2 to 3.5 parts of water to 1 part of isolate, wherein the water<br>
is at a temperature of at least 50°C. The hydrated isolate is then blended under<br>
conditions of shear for a period of time sufficient to form a hydrated protein granule.<br>
The formed granules are highly suitable as an extender for ground meats or as an<br>
ingredient in meat analogues. The raw materials used here are different from that of<br>
the present invention, and an isolate is too costly. Further, the process of preparation<br>
is entirely different from the present one.<br>
References may be made to US Patent US5626899 (1997) wherein a process for<br>
maKing vegetable-based meat extenders has been claimed. A vegetable protein<br>
crumble for use as a meat extender to replace portions of lean and/or fat i.s made<br>
from one part soy protein isolate hydrated in about 3.5-5.0 parts water at ambient<br>
temperature and then chopped. A vegetable protein and/or complex carbohydrate is<br>
added to the resulting mixture, and again chopped. Then the resulting composition is<br>
cooled overnight before being chopped or ground into crumbles. By way of example,<br>
a use of the crumble is described as a meat extender in pepperoni. The raw<br>
materials used here are different from that of the present invention, and an isolate is<br>
too costly. Further, the process of preparation is entirely different from the present<br>
one.<br>
Reference may be made to European Patent EP19900103415 (1983) wherein a<br>
method of processing whole soybeans to produce discrete, irregularly-shaped<br>
chunks or pieces of textured proteinaceous material which are free from off-flavors<br>
and odors and have a meat-like texture and appearance is described. Whole<br>
soybeans are hydrated and acidified to a pH in the range of about 4.5 to 6.5 and the<br>
pH of the soybeans is maintained in this range throughout processing. The acidified<br>
.vhoie soybeans are ground in an aqueous medium to provide an aqueous slurry or<br>
dough of soybean particles having a pH in the range of 4.5-6.5. The aqueous acidic<br>
slurry or dough is passed through a confined treatment zone in which high<br>
temperature pressurized steam is injected directly into a confined stream of the<br>
slurry or dough under conditions which effect textunzation of the soy protein in the<br>
form of discrete chunks or pieces which are discharged from the treatment zone. The<br>
texturized pieces, when discharged from the treatment zone or when cried and<br>
rehydrated are free of off-flavors and odors and have a meat-like texture, firmness<br>
ana appearance. They are suitable for use in a wide variety of food products,<br>
including frozen products, canned products and dry mix products. If desired,<br>
additives such as fiavoring, coloring, fat, seasoning and other protemaceous<br>
materials may be incorporated in the texturized soy protein pieces. The raw material<br>
used here is different from that used in the present claim. The drawback of this<br>
process lies in using acids for pH adjustment, and need further treatment to get rid of<br>
the same.<br>
Reference may be made to a European Patent EP0385266 (1990) where a method<br>
of producing simulated meat product from whole soybeans is disclosed. Whole<br>
soybeans has been used to produce discrete, irregularly-shaped chunks or pieces of<br>
textured protemaceous material which are free from off-flavors and odors and have a<br>
meat-like texture and appearance. Whole soybeans are hydrated and acidified to a<br>
pH in the range of about 4.5 to 6.5 and the pH of the soybeans is maintained in this<br>
range throughout processing. The acidified whole soybeans are ground in an<br>
aqueous medium to provide an aqueous slurry or dough of soybean particles having<br>
a pH in the range of 4.5-6.5. The aqueous acidic slurry or dough is passed through a<br>
confined treatment zone in which high temperature pressurized steam is injected<br>
directly into a confined stream of the slurry or dough under conditions which effect<br>
texturization of the soy protein in the form of discrete chunks or pieces which are<br>
discharged from the treatment zone. The texturized pieces, when discharged from<br>
the treatment zone or when dried and rehydrated are free of off-flavors and odors<br>
and have a meat-like texture, firmness and appearance. They are suitable for use in<br>
a wide variety of food products, including frozen products, canned products and dry<br>
mix products. If desired, additives such as flavoring, coloring, fat, seasoning and<br>
other proteinaceous materials may be incorporated in the texturized soy protein<br>
pieces. The raw material used here is different from that used in the present claim.<br>
The drawback of this process lies in using acids for pH adjustment, and need further<br>

The present invention is described hereafter with reference to the examples which<br>
are given by way of illustration and hence, should not be construed to limit the scope<br>
of the present invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Development of soy granules from texturised vegetable protein<br>
The texturised vegetable proteins (TVP) were prepared using a single screw cooking<br>
extruder with a barrel diameter of 115mm. This extruder is commercially used to<br>
manufacture TVP. Defatted soy flour with moisture and protein content of 7% and<br>
49%, respectively was fed to the extruder through a screw feeder. The required<br>
quantity of water was added directly to the extruder while in operation at a screw<br>
speed of 400rpm. The TVP pieces, coming out of the extruder die were subjected to<br>
cutting due to the action of rotary knife, were dried in a continuous drier for 45min at<br>
a temperature of 70°C to attain a product moisture content of 3-5%. Later, the TVP<br>
pieces were mixed with water in the ratio of 20:3 and allowed to equilibrate for<br>
2hours in closed condition. The semi.--**• and partially hydrated pieces were<br>
sheared in a hammer mill with 8 flexibi as and a sieve with holes each vi-th<br>
4mm diameter. The semi-wet soy granules thus obtained were dried in a tray drier<br>
for Zhours at a temperature of 60°C. The dried samples were sieved to grade the<br>
samples according to size and to remove the fines. The soy granules thus developed<br>
has sizes between 1 to 6 mm and a moisture content of 4%, The protein content of<br>
the product was about 50% and the colour of the product was light yellowish brown.<br>
The developed product can be used in several formulations that have been<br>
described in the following sections.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of ready-to-eat snacks using soy granules<br>
The soy granules prepared using the abovementioned process were used to prepare<br>
two types of ready-to-eat snacks. The first product is spicy in taste. It was made<br>
using 2 kg of soy granules on to which hot hydrogenated fat (90 gram) was sprayed<br>
along with sprinkling of a salt-spice mix containing 40 gram of common salt and 5<br>
gram of chili powder while the mass is in rotation in a coating pan. The developed<br>
snack has a protein content of about 43%. On the other hand, sweet snack product<br>
was prepared by adding a slurry containing 300 gram sugar and 5 gram of salt to 2<br>
kg of soy granules in a coating pan while using hot air at 70°C to dry the product to a<br>
moisture content below 5%. The protein of the ready-to-eat sweet granules has a<br>
protein content of about 27%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of traditional product such as spicy-soy-kofta to replace ground<br>
meat or mince<br>
The developed soy granules were used to prepare spicy-soy- kofta. A kofta is a<br>
traditional Indian food with spherical shape used in gravy and is made up of cooked<br>
mashed potato or minced meat etc. In the present case, meat was completely<br>
replaced by soy granules whereas other ingredients such as puffed Bengal gram (in<br>
form of split pulse and powder), salt, grou 'on, coconut and spices were used as<br>
pt 'gradients required for making m i ._,. The process of kofta mar . .icluces<br>
the hydration of soy granules in warm water for about 5-6 minutes followed by<br>
squeezing to remove excess water. Later, all the above mentioned ingredients along<br>
with hydrated soy granules were ground in wet condition and shaped into spherical<br>
balls of diameter varying between 25 to 30 mm. These raw balls were cooked in the<br>
boiling gravy made using wet-ground coconut, tomato, salt, onion and spices such<br>
as cloves, cinnamon, ginger and garlic in which refined sunflower oil was used for<br>
seasoning. The spicy-soy-kofta can be consumed as gravy/curry during breakfast or<br>
main meals along with cooked rice and noodles, chapathi or bread.<br>
Advantages of the present invention<br>
The developed soy granules have several advantages of which the most important<br>
aspect is that it belongs to the ready-to-eat form whereas the starting material (TVP)<br>
needs further cooking prior to consumption. The comparison of soy granules and<br>
TVP is shown in the Table 1 which clearly indicates the superiority of soy granules<br>
over TVP.<br>
