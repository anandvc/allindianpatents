				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to milling cutters and more<br>
particularly to a ball nose end mill having a single replaceable cutting insert<br>
retained between clamping jaws, for use in high precision milling operations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Milling cutters are commonly used for profile and cavity milling in<br>
the auto, aircraft, die and mold industries. In order to achieve high accuracy<br>
and good surface quality in the work products produced by the milling cutters<br>
to which the present invention relates, the cutting insert should be retained in<br>
the milling cutter with a high degree of locational precision.<br>
A problem with prior art. milling cutters utilizing replaceable<br>
cutting inserts is that the latter are either flat plate-like or generally prismatic<br>
in shape and are clamped between two clamping jaws having clamping<br>
surfaces with geometries complementary to those of the surfaces of the<br>
cutting insert being clamped, i.e., flat or prismatic, respectively. The cutting<br>
insert is secured in position by means of a clamping screw that passes through<br>
through bores in the clamping jaws and in the cutting insert. Due to<br>
manufacturing tolerances it is difficult to ensure that the cutting insert is on a<br>
true centerline when retained in the milling cutter. Such manufacturing<br>
tolerances include, for example, the diameter of the clamping screw, the<br>
diameter of the through bores and the location of the through bores. That is.<br>
for cutting tools such as end mills having a single replaceable cutting insert<br>
retained between clamping jaws the radial location of two diametrically<br>
opposite cutting edges of the cutting insert can be ascertained only to within<br>
the total manufacturing tolerances. This being the case, the points on the<br>
cutting edges of the cutting insert will not necessarily lie precisely on a flight<br>
circle concentric with the axis of rotation of the milling cutter. For milling<br>
cutters having flat plate-like cutting inserts, manufacturing tolerances of the<br>
clamping screw and the through bore in the milling cutter and in the cutting<br>
insert are the main contributing factors to the radial location imprecision of<br>
the cutting insert. The radial location precision can be improved by using<br>
inserts that have generally prismatic abutting surfaces clamped in clamping<br>
jaws having complementary shaped clamping surfaces. However, even in this<br>
case radial location imprecision of the cutting insert will exist The main<br>
contribution to the radial location imprecision coming from geometrical<br>
factors such as the tolerance of manufacture of the angle between adjacent<br>
surfaces comprising the prismatic abutting surfaces.<br>
In EP 0 417 862 B1 a cutting tool assembly is described which I<br>
ensures effective clamping of a cutting insert in an insert holder so that the<br>
cutting insert is effectively retained against displacement under cutting forces,<br>
and so that the relative position of the cutting insert with respect to the cutting<br>
insert holder is maintained substantially invariant, both during cutting<br>
operations and also when inserts have to be replaced. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 3 of '862, effective retention of the cutting insert is obtained<br>
between ribs of the clamping jaws of the cutting insert holder and the cutting<br>
insert along discrete axially directed locations which are symmetrically<br>
disposed with respect to, and spaced from, a longitudinally directed median<br>
plane. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 4 of '862, instead of effective<br>
retention along discrete axially directed locations, the retention is along<br>
narrow axially directed intennediate curved portions.<br>
In both the embodiments described in '862 the ribs of the<br>
clamping jaws are formed with a clamping surface of substantially circular<br>
cross-sectional shape and the clamping contact between the clamping surfaces<br>
of the clamping jaws and the cutting insert is designed to take place along<br>
predetermined axial locations by forming the clamping surfaces of the cutting<br>
insert with side curved portions having a larger radius of curvature than that<br>
of the clamping surface of the clamping jaw and a central curved portion have<br>
a smaller radius of curvature than that of the clamping surface of the<br>
clamping jaw.<br>
It should be noted that in both embodiments described in EP '862<br>
the clamping surfaces of the cutting insert are of a non-uniform cross section<br>
and that in both embodiments the side portions of the clamping surfaces of<br>
the cutting inserts do not abut the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws. A<br>
disadvantage of such a clamping arrangement is that it cannot be applied to<br>
cutting tool assemblies such as end mills comprising a single replaceable<br>
cutting insert retained between a pair of clamping jaws. The cutting inserts of<br>
such cutting tool assemblies have a width, measured between the side cutting<br>
edges, which is much greater than their thickness, measured between the<br>
clamping surfaces of the cutting insert, and the clamping arrangement<br>
described in EP '862 would not provide adequate support for the side cutting<br>
edges of the cutting insert-<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the<br>
aforementioned disadvantage and to provide a milling cutter that will ensure<br>
accurate radial location of replaceable cutting inserts when clamped in the<br>
milling cutter whilst providing adequate support for the side cutting edges of<br>
the cutting insert.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
indexable cutting insert for such a milling cutter.<br>

and the lower edge 72 is identical in form to the upper edge 70.<br>
In Fig. 6. three dimensions. W. T and t defining the basic linear-<br>
dimensions of the cutting insert in an end view are shown. The width. W.<br>
of the cutting insert is defined as the distance oerween opposing portions of<br>
the peripheral side surface. The maximum thickness. T. of the cutting insert<br>
is defined as the maximum distance between the insert upper and lower<br>
clamping surfaces as measured in an end view. The minimum thickness, to<br>
of the cutting insert is defined as the minimum distance between the insert<br>
upper and lower clamping surfaces as measured in an end view.<br>
Generally, W/T lies in the range 2.5 to 4 0 and W/t lies in the<br>
range 4.0 to 6.0. In accordance with a specific application. W/T is equal to<br>
3.3 and W/t is equal to 5.3.<br>
In accordance with a preferred, embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the radii of curvature Rl. R2 of the lower and upper clamping<br>
surfaces of the clamping jaws are substantially equal in magnitude.<br>
R1=R2=R, defining a single value for the radius of curvature R for each of<br>
the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws. The cylinder axes of the lower<br>
and upper clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws are parallel and lie in the<br>
vertical median plane of the cutting insert, when the cutting insert is<br>
retained in the cutting insert holder.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the radius of curvature<br>
of the clamping jaw's clamping surfaces R is greater than the radius of<br>
curvature r of the cutting insert clamping surfaces. That is. for the general<br>
case, the value of Rl is greater than the value of rl and the value of R2 is<br>
greater than the value of r2. In accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
R1=R2=R and r1=r2=r and the value of R is greater than the value of r.<br>
Symbolically, this can be expressed as R=r-d. where d is a positive<br>
lumber.<br>
In accordance with one specific application, r = 16 mm and R =<br>
16.2 mm.<br>
The cutting insert 24 is provided with two axial abutment surfaces<br>
88a. 88b at its; front end 24' and two axial abutment surfaces 90a. 90b at it<br>
rear end 24". The axial abutment surfaces are transverse to the axis of<br>
rotation B of the cutting insert. When the cutting insert 24 is retained in the<br>
insert retaining slot 36. as shown in Fig. 1. the upper rear abutment surface<br>
90b abuts the upper insert axial location surface 58. and the lower rear<br>
abutment surface 9()a (not seen in the figures') abuts the lower insert axial<br>
location surface 56. thereby fixing the axial location of the cutting insert in<br>
the cutting insert holder. The axial abutment surfaces 88a. 88b; 90a, 90b are<br>
preferably ground in order to increase the accuracy of the axial location of the<br>
cutting insert in the cutting insert holder.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 7 to 10. In order to securely<br>
clamp the cutting insert in the cutting insert holder the cutting insert is<br>
provided with at least one through hole passing through the cutting insert<br>
between the insert upper and lower clamping surfaces. In general, a cutting<br>
insert for clamping in the insert holder shown in Fig. 1 will have either one<br>
or two through holes.. Gepending on the length of the cutting insert The<br>
reason for this being that the through bore 44 in the upper clamping jaw 32<br>
and the associated threaded bore 52 in the lower clamping jaw 34 are<br>
preferably located as close as possible to the front end of the cutting insert<br>
Holder in order to ensure that the front end portions of the clamping jaws<br>
close tightly on the retained cutting insert.<br>
Figs. 8 to 10 show cutting inserts of different lengths. The<br>
length of a cutting insert in accordance with the present invention is<br>
measured along the axis of rotation B from one end of the cutting insert to<br>
the other. For example, in Fig. 8. the length of the cutting insert 24 is<br>
measured alone the axis B from its front end 24' to us rear end 24"<br>
Typically, in accordance with the present invention, insert lengths can vary<br>
from very short, having a length of approximately 0.5W to very long.<br>
having a length of approximately 2W. The cutting insert 100 shown in Fig.<br>
9 is relatively short, and is provided with a single through hole, namely a<br>
circular bore 102 having a bore axis 104 located substantially at the center of<br>
the cutting insert in a top view of the cutting insert. The bore axis 104 is<br>
perpendicular to the axis of rotation B of the cutting insert and lies in a<br>
vertical longitudinal median plane of the cutting insert. The cutting insert<br>
100 is provided with two axial abutment surfaces 88a, 88b at its front end<br>
100' and two axial abutment surfaces 90a. 90b at it rear end 100" (only one<br>
front axial abutment surface 88b and one rear axial abutment surface 90b are<br>
seen in Fig. 9. However, the arrangement of the abutment surfaces is the same<br>
as that of the abutment surfaces for the medium length cutting insert 24<br>
shown in the perspective view in Fig. 1). The axial abutment surfaces are<br>
transverse to the axis of rotation B of the cutting insert. The cutting insert<br>
106 shown in Fig. 10 is relatively long and is provided with two circular<br>
bores, a forward circular bore 108 and. a rear circular bore 110 having bore<br>
axes 112 and 114. respectively. The bore diameter D1. D2 of each of the two<br>
circular bores are of substantially equal magnitude D1=D2=D and each bore<br>
axis is located at substantially the same distance X1=X2= X from the center<br>
of the cutting insert 116 in a top view of the cutting insert. The distance<br>
between the two bore axes X+X=2X is greater than a bore diameter D. The<br>
bore axes 112. 114 are perpendicular to the axis of rotation B of the cutting<br>
insert and lie in a vertical, longitudinal median plane of the cutting insert.<br>
The cutting insert 24 shown in Figs. 7 and 8 is of an intermediate<br>
length its length being typically of the order of 1.5W, and is provided with a<br>
single through hole 118 formed from two intersecting circular bores, a<br>
forward circular bore 120 and a rear circular bore 122 havine bore axes 124<br>
and 126. respectively. The bore diameter of the forward circular bore 120 is<br>
substantially equal in magnitude to the bore diameter of the rear circular bore<br>
122 and. in a top view of the cutting insert 24. each bore axis is located at<br>
substantially the same distance from the center 128 of the cutting insert 24.<br>
The distance between the two bore axes is less than a bore diameter and<br>
therefore the two bores overlap. The bore axes 124, 126 are perpendicular to<br>
the axis of rotation B of the cutting insert and lie in a vertical longitudinal<br>
median plane of the cutting insert.<br>
The two dotted lines in Fig. 7 divide the insert upper clamping<br>
surface 64 into three regions, two substantially identical outer regions<br>
64' separated by a central region 64". This division into three regions :;s not<br>
a physical division, since all portions of the insert upper clamping surface<br>
64 lie on the same concave surface. However. when the cutting insert is<br>
clamped in the cutting insert holder 22 of the embodiment shown in Figs.<br>
4a, 4b and 5b (as will be described in greater detail below, with respect to<br>
Fig. 18), the outer regions 42' of the lower clamping surface 42 of the upper<br>
clamping jaw 32 abut the insert upper clamping surface 64 along the outer<br>
regions 64' thereof. Hence, the outer regions 64' of the insert upper<br>
clamping surface 64 are regions that correspond to the outer regions 42' of<br>
the lower clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32. Similarly, the<br>
insert lower clamping surface 66 is divided into three regions, two<br>
substantially identical outer regions 66' separated by a central region 66".<br>
The two outer regions 66' correspond to the two outer regions 50' of the<br>
upper clamping surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34.<br>
It should be noted that the outer regions 64' of the insert upper<br>
clamping surface 64 extend to the upper edge 70 thereof. Similarly, the<br>
outer regions 66' of the insert lower clamping surface 66 extend to the<br>
upper edge 72 thereof. In a similar manner, the clamping surfaces of the<br>
cutting inserts 100. 106 shown in Figs. 9 and 10 are divided into three<br>
regions.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 11. The clamping screw 26 of the<br>
present invention has a screw axis C and comprises generally three portions:<br>
an upper portion 140. a central portion 142 and a lower portion 144. The<br>
upper portion 140 comprises an upper cylindrical portion 146 and an upper<br>
frusto-conical portion 148. The upper frusto-conical portion 148 tapers<br>
downwardly and inwardly from the upper cylindrical portion 146 toward the<br>
central portion 142. The clamping screw upper portion 140 is provided with a<br>
socket 149 such as a Torx or hexagonal socket, for receiving a wrench for<br>
tightening or loosening the clamping screw 26. The clamping screw central<br>
portion 142 has a central cylindrical portion 150 connected at its upper end to<br>
he upper frusto-conical portion 148 and at its loner end to a central frusto-<br>
conical portion 152. The central frusto-conical portion 152 tapers<br>
downwardly and inwardly from its upper end. where it is connected to the<br>
central cylindrical portion 150. to its lower end where it is connected. is a<br>
arrow neck portion 154, to the clamping screw lower portion 144. The<br>
clamping screw lower portion 144 comprises a threaded portion 156 of the<br>
clamping screw 26. The central frusto-conical portion 152 tapers at an angle<br>
8 to the screw axis C. This angle will be referred to herein as the angle of<br>
toper of the central frusto-conical portion 152.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 12 to 16. illustrating the<br>
principle stages involved in clamping the cutting insert in the cutting insert<br>
holder 22. For illustrative purposes the cutting insert holder 22 shown in<br>
Figs. 12 to 16 is in accordarce with the first embodiment wherein, in an end<br>
view of the cutting insert, holder 22 the lower clamping surface 42 of the<br>
upper clamping jaw 32 and the upper clamping surface 50 of the lower<br>
clamping jaw 34 and are both uniformly convex. The cutting insert shown<br>
in these figures is a cutting insert 100 with a single circular through bore<br>
102. Furthermore, for simplicity of illustration the case R1=R2=R and<br>
r1=r2=r is considered. The gaps between the curing insert 100 and the<br>
cutting insert holder 22. between the camping screw 26 and the cutting<br>
insert holder 22. and between the camping screw 26 and the cutting insert<br>
100 are not to scale and have been exaggerated for illustrative purposes.<br>
Figs. 12 and 14 show the initial arrangement after the cutting<br>
insert 100 has been placed in the insert receiving slot 36 and the clamping<br>
screw 26 has been positioned in the cutting insert holder 22. so that, it passes<br>
through the bore 44 in the upper clamping jaw 32. through the through bore<br>
102 in the cutting insert 100 and is received in the threaded bore 52 in the<br>
lower clamping jaw 34. In this position, due to the fact that R=r+o. the<br>
 insert lower clamping surface 66 rests on the upper clamping surface 50 of<br>
the lower clamping jaw 34 with the outer regions 66' of the insert lower<br>
clamping surface 66 engaging the upper clamping surface 50 of the iower<br>
clamping jaw 34 and with a maximum clearance d between the central<br>
region 66" of the insert lower clamping surface 66 and the central region<br>
 50" of the upper clamping surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34. in<br>
accordance with a specific application the clearance d is typically of the<br>
order of 0.005 mm to 0.02 mm. There is also a clearance h between the<br>
insert upper clamping surface 64 and the lower clamping surface 42 of the<br>
upper clamping jaw 32.<br>
 The through bore 44 in the upper clamping jaw 32 and the<br>
threaded bore 52 in the lower clamping jaw 34 have a common longitudinal<br>
bore axis E. The screw axis C coincides with the longitudinal bore axis E<br>
and makes an angle ø with a normal N to the axis of rotation A of the<br>
cutting insert holder 22. The angle ø is chosen to be equal to the angle of<br>
 taper ? of the central frusto-conical portion 152. With this choice of the<br>
angle ø, the rearmost generator 153" (i.e.. rearmost longitudinally directed<br>
straight line on the central frusto-conical portion 152) of the central frusto-<br>
conical portion 152 is parallel to the normal N to the axis of rotation A.<br>
Fig. 13 shows the situation after the clamping screw 26 has been<br>
tightened until the upper frusto-conical portion 148 of the clamping screw<br>
26 engages a corresponding frusto-conicai bore 158 that constitutes part of<br>
the through bore 44 in the upper clamping jaw 32. It is pointed out that due<br>
to the fact that the rearmost generator 153" of the central frusto-conical<br>
portion 152 is parallel to the normal N. that as the clamping screw 26 is<br>
tightened the rearmost generator of the central frusto-conicai portion 152<br>
moves parallel to itself and therefore :s always parallel to the normal N to<br>
the axis of rotation A. In a non-binding example, for the position shown in<br>
Fig. 13, the clearance h between the insert upper clamping surface 64 and<br>
the lower clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32 is<br>
approximately 0.1 mm. There is a clearance x. of approximately 0.035 mm.,<br>
between the rearmost generator 153" of the central frusto-conicai portion<br>
152 and the rear portion 102' of the circular bore 102 of the cutting insert<br>
100.<br>
Fig. 15 shows the situation after further tightening of the<br>
clamping screw 26. During the tightening of the clamping screw 26 the<br>
clearance h between the insert upper clamping surface 64 and the lower-<br>
clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32 is gradually reduced and<br>
a force is exerted by the clamping jaws on the insert clamping surfaces<br>
causing the cutting insert 100 to become longitudinally aligned in the<br>
cutting insert holder 22 so that the longitudinal axis of rotational symmetry<br>
B of the cutting insert becomes aligned with the axis of rotation A of the<br>
cutting insert holder 22. In passing from the situation shown in Fig. 13 to<br>
that shown in Fig. 15. the clamping screw 26 has moved a vertical distance<br>
of approximately 0.1 mm and a corresponding horizontal distance of 0.005<br>
mm. reducing the clearance x between the rearmost generator 153" of the<br>
central frusto-conicai portion 152 and the rear portion 102" of the circular<br>
bore 102 of the cutting insert 100 to approximately 0.03 mm<br>
As the clamping screw 26 is further tightened, the rearmost<br>
insert 24. The forward circular bore 120 is engaged by the clampine screw<br>
26 at the two rear side portions of the central frusto-conical portion 152<br>
corresponding to the rear side portions 120" of the forward circular bore<br>
120. Each of the two rear side portions of the central frusto-conical pertion<br>
152 is located in a region of a portion of a rear side generator 153' of the<br>
central frusto-conical portion 152 of the clamping screw 26. A rear side<br>
generator 153' is shown in Fig. 11 by a dashed line. In Fig. 11. only one of<br>
the two rear side generators 153' is seen, the other one being on the side of<br>
the central frusto-conical portion 152 not seen in the figure, parallel to and<br>
"directly behind" the rear side generator 153' that is seen. In order to<br>
increase the areas of engagement between the tw o rear side portions of the<br>
central frusto-conical portion of the clamping screw and the two the rear<br>
side portions 120" of the forward circular bore 120. the design of the<br>
through hole 118 can be suitably altered in the regions of the two the rear<br>
side portions 120", as will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Fig. 18 shows the situation after the final tightening of the<br>
clamping screw 26, for a cutting tool assembly having a cutting insert<br>
holder 22 with the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws divided into<br>
three regions (as shown in Fig. 5b), in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen, the regions of<br>
abutment between the upper surface of the cutting insert and the lower<br>
clamping surface of the upper clamping jaw 32 is restricted to the outer<br>
regions 64' of the clamping surfaces of the cutting insert and the<br>
corresponding outer regions 42' of the lower clamping surface of the upper<br>
clamping jaw 32. Since the central region 42" of the lower clamping<br>
surface 42 has a larger radius of curvature than that of the outer regions<br>
12'. a clearance is formed between the central region 42" of the lower<br>
damping surface 42 and the central region 64' of the insert upper clamping<br>
surface 64. Therefore, in accordance with the embodiment of the outline<br>
insert holder with the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws divided into<br>
three regions, the central region 42" of the lower clamping surface 42<br>
becomes a clearance surface and does not engage the central resion 64" of<br>
the insert upper clamping surface 64. Similarly, the regions of abutment<br>
between the insert lower clamping surface 66 and the upper clamping<br>
surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34 are restricted to the outer regions<br>
66' of the insert lower clamping surface 66 and the corresponding outer<br>
regions 50' of the upper clamping surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with the embodiment of the cutting insert holder<br>
with the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws divided into three regions.<br>
the central region 50" of the upper clamping surface 50 becomes a<br>
clearance surface and does not engage the central region 66" of the insert<br>
lower clamping surface 66. This arrangement assures that the clamping<br>
forces applied by the clamping jaws of the cutting insert holder on the<br>
clamping surfaces of the cutting insert are applied to the outer (or. side)<br>
regions of the clamping surfaces, thereby giving support to the cutting edges<br>
extending along the sides of the cutting insert from the front of the cutting<br>
insert to the rear of the cutting insert-<br>
It should be noted, that in accordance with the present invention,<br>
the insert upper clamping surface 64 engages the lower clamping surface 42<br>
of the upper clamping jaw 32 and the insert lower clamping surface 66<br>
engages the upper clamping surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the central region 42" of the lower clamping surface 42 does not<br>
engage the central region 64" of the insert upper clamping surface 64 and<br>
the central region 50" of the upper clamping surface 50 does not engage the<br>
central region 66" of the insert lower clamping surface 66. hence only the<br>
outer regions 64', 66' of the cutting insert engage the clamping surfaces 42.<br>
50 of the clamping jaws. This is in complete contrast with the situation in<br>
EP 0 417 862 B1. wherein the side portions numbered 16a. 16b and 16' a.<br>
16' b therein) of the cutting insert described therein do not engase the<br>
clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws.<br>
In Fig. 18 two angles al and a 2 are defined relative to the center<br>
of curvature O of the lower clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw<br>
32. The angles oil and a.2 are defined in a plane perpendicular to the axis<br>
of rotation A of the cutting insert holder 22 Hence, the dashed lines and<br>
the points O. P1 and P2 are all located in the same plane perpendicular to<br>
the axis of rotation A The angle al defines the angular location of the<br>
innermost point of contact P1 between an outer region 42'of the lower<br>
clamping surface 42 of the upper damping jaw 32 and the insert upper<br>
clamping surface 64. The angle a2 defines the angular location of the<br>
outermost point of contact P2 between an outer region 42'of the lower<br>
clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32 and the insert upper<br>
clamping surface 64. Since a2 is greater than al, and since the clamping<br>
force on the cutting insert is applied in a direction parallel to the<br>
longitudinal vertical median plane M of the cutting insert, which coincides<br>
with a longitudinal vertical median plane of the cutting tool assembly when<br>
the cutting insert is retained in the cutting insert holder, the condition for<br>
sliding contact between the insert upper clamping surface 64 and the lower<br>
damping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32 is that al be greater than<br>
the angle of friction. In accordance with a specific application the cutting<br>
nsert holder 22 is made of steel and the cutting insert 24. 100, 106 is made<br>
of cemented carbide. In accordance with this specific application al should<br>
be greater than 10°. Preferably, a2 is approximately 30°.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain<br>
degree of particularity of should be understood that various alterations and<br>
nodifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
invention as hereinafter claimed. In particular, the invention has been<br>
demonstrated with respect to a ball nose end mill having a sinele replaceable<br>
cutting insert retained between the clamping jaws of the ball nose end mill. It<br>
will be appreciated that the invention does not relate to a specific type of<br>
milling cutter but relates to any milling cutter having a single replaceable<br>
cutting insert retained between the clamping jaws of the milling cutter.<br>
provided that the clamping surfaces of the clamping jaws are at least<br>
partially convex and the insert clamping surfaces are concave and that the<br>
radius of curvature of the clamping surfaces of the damping jaws is larger<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1. 2. 3a. 3b and 5a. As shown, a<br>
cutting tool assembly 20 comprises a cutting insert holder 22 having an axis<br>
of rotation A. a cutting insert 24 and a clamping screw 26 for securing the<br>
cutting insert in the cutting insert holder. The cutting insert holder 22<br>
comprises an elongated cylindrical body portion 28 and a clamping portion<br>
30 in a front portion thereof. The clamping portion 30 consists of an upper<br>
damping jaw 32 separated from a lower clamping jaw 34 by an insert<br>
receiving slot 36. The upper clamping jaw 32 has an upper peripheral<br>
surface 38 having a chip evacuation recess 40 in a front portion thereof, a<br>
lower clamping surface 42 and a through bore 44 transverse to the axis of<br>
rotation A. The lower clamping jaw 34 has a lower peripheral surface 46<br>
having a chip evacuation recess 48 in a front portion thereof, an upper<br>
clampins surface 50 and a threaded bore 52 transverse to the axis oi rotation<br>
A and aligned with the through bore 44 in the upper clamping jaw The<br>
terms "upper", "lower", "forward" and "rear" are used herein with reference<br>
to the orientation of the cutting insert holder 22 and the cutting insert 24 as<br>
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Hence, the cutting insert 24 has a forward end<br>
24' and a rear end 24" Similarly, the insert receiving slot 36 has a forward<br>
end 36' and a rear end 36".<br>
The upper clamping jaw is resiliently connected to the lower<br>
clamping jaw at the rear end of the insert receiving slot via a slot 54<br>
transverse to the axis of rotation A. Adjacent the slot 54 are two insert axial<br>
location surfaces transverse to the axis of rotation A. a lower insert axial<br>
location surface 56 and an upper insert axial location surface 58. A lower<br>
generally cylindrical groove 60. transverse to the axis of rotation A. is located<br>
between the lower insert axial location surface 56 and the upper clamping<br>
surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34. An upper generally cylindrical<br>
groove 62. transverse to the axis of rotation A. is located between the upper<br>
insert axial location surface 58 and the lower clamping surface 42 of the<br>
upper clamping jaw 32.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the cutting insert<br>
holder 22. the lower clamping surface 42 of the upper clamping jaw 32<br>
conforms with a portion of a cylindrical surface having a radius of curvature<br>
R1 and a cylinder axis generally parallel to the axis of rotation A. so that in<br>
an end view of the cutting insert holder 22 the lower clamping surface of<br>
the upper clamping jaw is convex (see Figs. 3a and 5a). The upper<br>
clamping surface 50 of the lower clamping jaw 34 conforms with a portion<br>
of a cylindrical surface having a radius of curvature R2 and a cylinder axis<br>
generally parallel to the axis of rotation A. so that in an end view of the<br>
cutting insert holder 22 the upper clamping surface of the lower clamping<br>
jaw is convex (see Figs. 3b and 5a). Generally, the radii of curvature Rl.<br>
R2 cf the lower and upper clamping surfaces 42. 50 do not have to be<br>
identical.<br>
Figs. 4a. 4b and 5b show a second embodiment of the cutting<br>
insert holder 22. In accordance with this embodiment, which is a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the lower clamping surface 42 of the<br>
upper clamping jaw 32 is divided into tnree regions, two substantially<br>
identical outer regions 42' on either side of a central region 42" The terra<br>
-substantially identical" in this context is used to indicate that the two outer<br>
regions 42' are identical to within manufacturing tolerances. Each of the<br>
two outer regions conforms with a portion of a common cylindrical surface<br>
having a radius of curvature Rl and a cylinder axis generally parallel to the<br>
axis of rotation A. whereas the central region 42" is either planar. or<br>
:onforms with a portion of a cylindrical surface having a radius of curvature<br>
Rl' larger than the radius of curvature Rl of the outer regions 42'.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with this embodiment., the lower clamping surface<br>
42 of the upper clamping jaw 32 at least partially conforms with a portion of<br>
a cylindrical surface. Similarly, the upper clamping surface 50 of the lower<br>
clamping jaw 34 can be formed to at least partially conform with a portion<br>
cf a cylindrical surface by dividing it into three regions, two substantially<br>
identical outer regions 50'on either side of a central region 50". Each of<br>
the two outer regions 50' conforms with a portion of a common cylindrical<br>
surface having a radius of curvature R2 and a cylinder axis generally<br>
parallel to the axis of rotation A. whereas the central region 50" is either<br>
planar. or conforms with a portion of a cylindrical surface having a radius of<br>
curvature R2' larger than the radius of curvature R2 of the outer regions<br>
50' .<br>

comprises an insert upper clamping surface 64. an insert lower clamping<br>
surface 66 and a peripheral side surface 68 between the insert upper<br>
clamping surface and the insert lower clamping surface. The insert upper<br>
damping surface 64 intersects the peripheral side surface 68 at an upper<br>
edge 70 and the insert lower clamping surface 66 intersects the peripheral<br>
side surface 68 at a lower edge 72. The upper edge 70 constitutes a<br>
peripheral boundary of the insert upper clamping surface 64. similarly the<br>
lower edge 72 constitutes a peripheral boundary of the insert lower<br>
clamping surface 66. The cutting insert 24 has a longitudinal axis of rotation<br>
B. In accordance with a preferred embodiment. the axis of rotation B.<br>
constitues an axis of rotational symmetry of the cuuing insert about which<br>
the cutting insert has 180° rotational symmetry and the lower edge 72 is<br>
equivalent in form to the upper edge 70. due to the 180° rotational symmetry<br>
of the cutting insert about the axis of rotational .symmetry B.<br>
The cutting inserr 24 is indexable and therefore the perpheral<br>
side surface 68 of the cutting insert is provided with two diametrically<br>
opposite pairs of cutting edges, a front pair of cuttins edges 74a, 74b and a<br>
rear pair of cutting edges 76a. 76b. When the cutting insert 24 is retained in<br>
the insert receiving slot 36. the from pair of cutting edges 74a. 74b is<br>
located closer to the from end of the insert receiving pocket and constitute a<br>
pair of operative cutting edges and the rear pair of cutting edges 76a. 76b is<br>
located closer to the rear end of the insert receiving pocket and constitute a<br>
pair of inoperative cutting edges<br>
The cutting insert has a first transverse axis T1 passing through<br>
the peripheral side surface 68 and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of<br>
rotation B. The cutting insert has a second transverse axis T2 perpendicular<br>

edges, mat is. between the front pair 74a. 74b and the rear pair of cutting<br>
edges 76a. 76b<br>
For the front pair of cutting edges, cutting edge 74a extends from<br>
a region close to where the longitudinal axis of rotational symmetry B<br>
passes through the peripheral side surface 68 downwards and rearwards<br>
towards the notch 78' whilst the other cutting edge 74b extends from the<br>
same region close to where the longitudinal axis of rotational symmetn' B<br>
passes through the peripheral side surface 68 upwards and rearwards<br>
towards the diametrically opposite notch 78" Due to the symmetrical<br>
nature of the cutting insert, the rear pair of cutting edges are identical to the<br>
front pair of cutting edges. Each cutting edge is provided with a relief<br>
surface 80 and a rake surface 82.<br>
The insert upper clamping surface 64 conforms with a portion of<br>
a cylindrical surface having a radius of curvature r1 and a cylinder axis<br>
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of rotational symmetry B.<br>
Similarly, the insert lower clamping surface 66 conforms with a portion of a<br>
cylindrical surface having a radius of curvature r2 and a cylinder axis<br>
generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of rotational symmetry B. Hence.<br>
in an end view of the cutting insert 24 the insert's upper and lower clamping<br>
surfaces are concave (see Fig. 6). Generally, the radii of curvature r1, r2 of<br>
the insert upper and lower clamping; surfaces do not have to be identical.<br>

single value r for the radius of curvature for each of the cutting insert<br>
clamping surfaces. The cylinder axis of the lower clamping surface is<br>
parallel to the cylinder axis of the upper clamping surface and both the<br>
cylinder axes lie in a vertical longitudinal median plane of the cutting insert<br>
which includes the axes T2 and 13. In accordance with this preferred<br>
embodiment, the longitudinal axis (if rotation B and the first transverse axis<br>
T1 are axes of rotational symmetry. The cutting insert 24 having 180º<br>
