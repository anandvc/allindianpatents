				<td>The present invention relates to compounds useful in the inhibition of metalloproteinases and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these, as well as their use.<br>
The compounds of this invention are inhibitors of one or more metalloproteinase enzymes. Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N.M. Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP 10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP 12), enamelysin (MMP 19), the MT-MMPs (MMP 14, MMP 15, MMP 16, MMP 17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNF converting enzymes (ADAM 10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloprotenases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al., (1997) Biochem J. 321_:265-279).<br>
Metalloproteinases have been associated with many disease conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these disease conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis),<br>
inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease)); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis, the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; and extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atheroscelerosis.<br>
A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known; different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases. We have discovered a new class of compounds that are inhibitors of metalloproteinases and are of particular interest in inhibiting MMP-13, as well as MMP-9. The compounds of this invention have beneficial potency and/or pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
MMP13, or collagenase 3, was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije et al. (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry 269(24): 16766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that MMP13 expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation MMP13 has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8(2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson etal., (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2).499-508] and epidermal tumours [K. Airola etal., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2) :225-231]. These results are suggestive that MMP13 is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.<br>
Recent published data implies that MMP13 plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with MMP13's substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3)J6l-768; V. Knauper et al., (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-1550], MMP13 has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M.<br>
Stahle-Backdahl etai, (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(5V717-728; N. Johansson eial, (1997) Dev. Dyn. 208(3):387-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al, (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595, P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; O. Lindy etal., (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40(8): 1391-1399]: and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai etai, (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(4}: 701-710]. MMP13 has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al., (1998) Am. J. Pathol 152(6): 1489-1499] and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(1):96-101].<br>
MMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92kDa TypelV Collagenase; 92kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purifed, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 (S.M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol Chem. 264 (29) : 17213-17221. Pubished erratum in J. Biol Chem. (1990) 265 (36): 22570).   A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease : T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998) (In : Matrix Metalloproteinases. 1998. Edited by W.C. Parks &amp; R.P. Mecham. ppl 15 - 148. Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review by T.H. Vu &amp;Z. Werb (1998).<br>
The expression of MMP9 is restricted normally to a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, it's expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is fiirther regulated in vivo by interaction with TIMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases -1), a naturally-occurring protein. TIMP-1 binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.<br>
There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones, and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues. Increased MMP9 expression has observed in certain pathological conditions, therebye implicating MMP9 in disease processed such as arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.<br>

Isolated Enzyme Assays<br>
Matrix Metalloproteinase family including for example MMP13. Recombinant human proMMP 13 may be expressed and purified as described by Knauper et al. [V. Knauper et al., (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271; 1544-1550 (1996)]. The purified enzyme can be used to monitor inhibitors of activity as follows: purified<br>
proMMP13 is activated using ImM amino phenyl mercuric acid (APMA), 20 hours at 21°C; the activated MMP13 (11.25ng per assay) is incubated for 4-5 hours at 35°C in assay buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.1M NaCl, 20mM CaCl2, 0.02 mM ZnCl and 0.05% (w/v) Brij 35 using the synthetic substrate 7-methoxycoumarin-4-<br>
yl)acetyl.Pro.Leu.Gly.Leu.N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl.Ala.Arg.NH2 in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Activity is determined by measuring the fluorescence at ex 328nm and A.em 393nm. Percent inhibition is calculated as follows: % Inhibition is equal to the [Fluorescenceplus inhibitor - Fluorescencebackground] divided by the [Fluorescenceminus inhibitor -Fluorescencebackground] .<br>
A similar protocol can be used for other expressed and purified pro MMPs using substrates and buffers conditions optimal for the particular MMP, for instance as described in C. Graham Knight etal., (1992) FEBS Lett. 2960)263-266.<br>
Adamalvsin family including for example TNF convertase<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit proTNFa convertase enzyme may be assessed using a partially purified, isolated enzyme assay, the enzyme being obtained from the membranes of THP-1 as described by K. M. Mohler et al, (1994) Nature 370:218-220. The purified enzyme activity and inhibition thereof is determined by incubating the partially purified enzyme in the presence or absence of test compounds using the substrate 4',5'-Dimethoxy-fluoresceinyl Ser.Pro.Leu.Ala.Gln.Ala.Val.Arg.Ser.Ser.Ser.Arg.Cys(4-(3-succinimid-l-yl)-fluorescein)-NH2 in assay buffer (50mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2mM CaCl2), at 26°C for 18 hours. The amount of inhibition is determined as for MMP 13 except ex 490nm and em 530nm were used. The substrate was synthesised as follows. The peptidic part of the substrate was assembled on Fmoc-NH-Rink-MBHA-polystyrene resin either manually or on an automated peptide synthesiser by standard methods involving the use of Fmoc-amino acids and 0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) as coupling agent with at least a 4- or 5-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acid and FiBTU. Ser1 and Pro2 were double-coupled. The following side chain protection strategy was employed; Ser1Bu'), Gln5(Trityl), Arg8'12(Pmc or Pbf), Ser9'10'11(Trityl), Cys13(Trityl). Following assembly, the N-terminal Fmoc-protecting group was removed by treating the Fmoc-peptidyl-resin with in DMF. The amino-peptidyl-resin so obtained was acylated by treatment for 1.5-2hr at 70°C with 1.5-2 equivalents of<br>
4',5'-dimethoxy-fluorescein-4(5)-carboxylic acid [Khanna &amp; Ullman, (1980) Anal Biochem. 108:156-161) which had been preactivated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole in DMF]. The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was then simultaneously deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% each of water and triethylsilane. The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was isolated by evaporation, trituration with diethyl ether and filtration. The isolated peptide was reacted with 4-(N-maleimido)-fluorescein in DMF containing diisopropylethylamine, the product purified by RP-HPLC and finally isolated by freeze-drying from aqueous acetic acid. The product was characterised by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid analysis.<br>

Pharmacodynamic test<br>
To evaluate the clearance properties and bioavailability of the compounds of this invention an ex vivo pharmacodynamic test is employed which utilises the synthetic substrate assays above or alternatively HPLC or Mass spectrometric analysis. This is a generic test which can be used to estimate the clearance rate of compounds across a range of species. Animals (e.g. rats, marmosets) are dosed iv or po with a soluble formulation of compound (such as 20%w/v DMSO, 60% w/v PEG400) and at subsequent time points (e.g. 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 1220 mins) the blood samples are taken from an appropriate vessel into 10U heparin. Plasma fractions are obtained following centrifligation and the plasma proteins precipitated with acetonitrile (80%w/v final concentration). After 30 mins at -20°C the plasma proteins are sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant fraction is evaporated to dryness using a Savant speed vac. The sediment is reconstituted in assay buffer and subsequently analysed for compound content using the synthetic substrate assay. Briefly, a compound concentration-response curve is constructed for the compound undergoing<br>
evaluation. Serial dilutions of the reconstituted plasma extracts are assessed for activity and the amount of compound present in the original plasma sample is calculated using the concentration-response curve taking into account the total plasma dilution factor.<br>
In vivo assessment<br>
Test as an anti-TNF agent<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFa inhibitors is assessed in the rat. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-210g) are dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route e.g. peroral (p.o), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c). Ninety minutes later rats are sacrificed using a rising concentration of CO2 and bled out via the posterior vena cavae into 5 Units of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples are immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at -20°C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFa production by LPS-stimulated human blood. The rat plasma samples are thawed and 175µl of each sample are added to a set format pattern in a 96U well plate. Fifty µl of heparinized human blood is then added to each well, mixed and the plate is incubated for 30 min at 37°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25µl; final concentration 10µg/ml) is added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells are incubated with 25 µl of medium alone. Plates are then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200µl of the supernatants are transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20°C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>
