"Controlled Release Formulation of Lamotrigine"<br>
We, TORRENT PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED, Torrent House, Off Ashram Road, Dinesh Hall, Ahmedabad - 380 009, Gujarat, India;<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
393/MUMNP/2004<br><br>
GRANTED<br>

CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION OF LAMOTRIGINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to rapidly disintegrating multiparticulate controlled release formulations of lamotrigine having an improved pharmacokinetic profile resulting in reduced dosing frequency. This invention further relates to a process for preparing the dosage form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Controlled release refers to the release of the therapeutically active agent from a<br>
composition or dosage form in which the agent is released according to a desired profile over an<br>
extended period of time.   Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release,<br>
prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles.   In contrast to immediate<br>
release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject<br>
over an extended period of time according to predetermined profile.  Such release rates can<br>
provide therapeutically effective levels of an agent for an extended period of time and thereby<br>
provide a longer period of pharmacological or diagnostic response as compared to conventional<br>
rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits<br>
that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. For<br>
example, in the treatment of chronic pain, controlled release formulations are often highly<br>
preferred over conventional short acting formulations.<br>
Controlled release pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are designed to improve the delivery profile of agents, such as drugs, medicaments, active agents, diagnostic agents, or any substance to be internally administered to an animal, including humans. A controlled release composition is typically used to improve the effects of administered substances by optimizing the kinetics of delivery, thereby increasing bio-availability, convenience, and patient compliance, as well as minimizing side effects associated with inappropriate immediate release rates such as high initial release rate and, if undesired, uneven blood ortissue levels.<br>
Lamotrigine, an antiepileptic drug of the phenyltriazine class is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic drug.   Its chemical name is 3, 5-diamino-6 (2,3-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,4-triazine, its molecular formula is C9H7N5Cl2.   It is disclosed in EP-A-0021121, which is incorporated by reference. Lamotrigine has been used to treat over a million patients worldwide, including about 4000<br><br><br><br><br><br>
adults and over 1000 children in clinical trials, Extensive experience "with lamotrigine has indicated that it may be effective when other anticonvulsant drugs have failed. It is a valuable broad-spectrum drug that is well tolerated and has few adverse effects apart from skin rash (Besag FMC, CNS Drugs 2000). Phannacokinetically, the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine vary linearly with the dose (Ramsay RE, 1991). Over the range 50 to 400mg as a single dose, Cmax increases proportionately from 0.58 to 4.63 fig/ml, as does the AUC (29.9 to 211.9 mg/L.h). Acute and chronic studies in humans have suggested that lamotrigine levels of 1 -3 μg/ml are effective in controlling seizures (Betts et al, 1991). Adverse events associated with lamotrigine are typical of antiepileptic drugs, namely dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, somnolence, headache, and asthenia. The incidence of such side effects is around 10% (Ramsay RE, 1991), Overall, 8.6% of patients were removed from clinical trials because of adverse experiences that included, in addition to rash, nausea/vomrting and intolerable episodes of the CNS-related events (Ramsay RE, 1991; Goa KL et al, 1993).<br>
Neurological side effects are normally seen at higher plasma concentrations (which are most likely to occur at peak plasma concentrations). During the first 18 weeks of lamotrigine treatment 16.7% of patients reported nausea and vomiting at a mean concentration of 6.00 to 7.99 μg/ml and 100% reporting headache and ataxia at &gt;10 μg/ml (Goa KL et al, 1993). Similarly, Binnie et al, (1987) reported side effects only in patients with levels above 3 μg/mL<br>
Dose reduction and slow dosage escalation arc two techniques to overcome these peak time side effects (Binnie et al, 1987). The present invention will reduce these side effects by controlling the Cmax of lamotrigine by the use of a novel controlled release formulation of lamotrigine. It will also maintain the steady state concentration with little fluctuations. The reduced incidence of these neurological side effects will, improve patient compliance with the therapy.<br>
Serious skin reactions (including Steven Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis) occurring in patients taking lamotrigine were highlighted by the Committee of Safety Medicine (CSM) in 1997 and have subsequently been discussed in the literature (Mitchell P, 1997; Anon, Drug and Therapy Perspectives, 1998). Rash, which has occurred in 10% of patients in placebo-controlled trials has led to discontinuation of therapy in 1% of patients (most common cause of discontinuation) (Besag FMC, CNS Drugs ,2000). Skin reactions such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome are potentially fatal and have an incidence of 1 in 1000 person-years in adults. The incidence is higher in children Risk factors for skin reactions include high plasma concentration, concomitant sodium valproate therapy (Valproate reduces the hepatic clearance<br><br>
WO 03/104192	PCT/IN03/00213<br>
of lamotrigine thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the drug by approximately two fold for a given dose), a high initial dose of lamotrigine and rapid dose escalation (Mitchell P, 1997; Anon., Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance).<br>
There is some preliminary data that shows that slow dosage escalation or titration when 5 initiating therapy may lessen the likelihood of development of severe rash (Ramsay RE, 1991). Controlled release lamotrigine, which is designed to avoid excessive Cmax levels, will produce lower plasma concentrations which are reached over a longer period of time and will reduce the incidence of this troublesome side effect of lamotrigine. Further, the controlled release formulation will be much safer to use with concomitandy administered drugs such as phenytoin, 10     carbamazepine, sodium valproate etc.<br>
Presently lamotrigine is prescribed in conventional tablets or dispersible/chewable tablet form in doses ranging from 25 to 600 mg/day, once a day or two divided doses. Immediate release dosage forms provide rapid dissolution results with a rapid increase in blood plasma levels after each dosing, which causes adverse effects. The reasons for giving divided doses of 15 lamotrigine is to prevent very high concentrations in the plasma, which can occur with single daily dose of conventional formulation.<br>
It is a known fact that frequent dosing results in poor patient compliance resulting in an inadequate/sub-optimal therapeutic effect<br>
Peak trough fluctuations at steady state are reduced whenever one or more of the 20     following occur<br>
•	Increase in half-life.<br>
•	Shorter dosing interval<br>
•	Reduced rate of absorption.<br>
The oral administration of solid dosage forms, for example tablets, capsules, often<br>
2	5     presents ingestion problems for the patient, especially in case of children or old people. In order<br>
to get around this problem other forms of pharmaceutical formulations are resorted to, for example chewable tablets, dispersible tablets and monodose sachets, the contents of which are to be dissolved or suspended in water and taken orally.<br>
The problems inherent in the administration of divided doses of lamotrigine point to the<br>
3	0     desirability of providing a controlled release formulation of lamotrigine, which can be given once<br>
daily to improve the patient compliance, which can be taken without water or can be dispersed in water for the convenience of the patients and can provide an improved pharmacokinetic profile. Improved pharmacokinetic profile here means that the formulation will provide a more<br><br><br>
WO 03/104192<br><br>
PCT/IN03/00213<br><br>
constant blood level of drug and will show less fluctuation between the maximum and minimum plasma drug concentration than once or repeated doses of regular/immediate release drug formulation containing equal amounts of active ingredients administered per day.<br>
Formulations according to this aspect of me present invention are particularly useful in administration of medications to individuals who cannot or will not chew or swallow, such as debilitated patients, patients who have difficulty swallowing solids, and the elderly. Furthermore, the formulations according to the invention provide a further significant advantage with respect to tablet or simple capsule. People who need to swallow a tablet or a capsule under the above mentioned conditions may sometimes have to swallow the said tablet or capsule without water and that can be dangerous as the tablet or capsule can get iato trachea i.e. respiratory site.<br>
The prior art discloses many different types of multiple unit dosage forms. An example of a controlled release dosage form, which releases the active substance by diffusion through a membrane, is described in U.S. 4,927,640, ie. a multiple unit system containing small inert cores with an active substance and a release controlling polymeric membrane. The mechanical properties of such multiple units formulated into tablets are reported in Pharmaceutical Research, 10 (1993), p. 274. There are examples in prior art which disclose that pellets may be formulated into tablets, there are no examples describing any compositions of such a tablet formulation or a technique to manufacture such a formulation comprising lamotrigine which is given once a day and provided improved pharmacokinetic profile. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a multiparticulate controlled release dosage formulation of lamotrigine, which comprises:<br>
(a)	particles, which comprise lamotrigine;<br>
(b)	a release rate controlling polymer; and<br>
(c)	a rapidly disintegrating binder, which will allow the particles to rapidly disperse in an aqueous environment.<br>
Preferred dosage forms will comprise discrete pelleted cores covered with a rate controlling membrane where the core has either a spheronized homogeneous core or a heterogeneous core, which comprises an inert base having layers of drug applied by a suitable coating procedure.<br>

Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel lamotrigine<br>
dosage form that will improve patient compliance by (a) providing a rapidly disintegrating<br>
formulation that will disperse in the mouth for ease of administration or in water (b) will reduce<br>
the dosage frequency to once daily and (c) will provide a pharmacokinetic profile that will<br>
5     reduce or eliminate neurological side effects and/or skin reactions.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a dosage form of lamotrigine that will control the release of lamotrigine in such a manner that an effective concentration in the blood can be maintained over an extended period of time, but also the drug release should be such that  . the drug concentration in the blood remains relatively constant over the extended period of time 10     to improve therapeutic results and/or minimize the side effects.

The amount of plasticizer to be used is from about 1% to 60% based on me weight of<br>
5     the dry polymer(s),more preferably 5% to 60%. The polymeric coating can also include an anti-<br>
foaming agent to prevent foaming during the process. An example of an anti-foaming agent is<br>
Simethicone. The amount of anti-foaming agent to be used in the coating is preferably from 0%<br>
to 0.5% of the final coating formulation.<br>
The amount of polymers) to be used in forming the particles will be determined based<br>
10     on various parameters such as the desired delivery properties, including the amount of drug to<br>
be delivered, the drug release rate desired, and the size of the particles.   The rate controlling<br>
membrane on the particles, including all solid components thereof such as copolymer, filler,<br>
plasticizer and optional commonly used exeipients and processing aids, is from about 1% to<br>
150% weight gain on the cores, preferably 5% to 80% weight gam and more preferably 5% to<br>
15     60% weight gam on me cores. The rate controlling polymer membranecan be coated by  any<br>
known method, including spray application. Spraying can be carried out using a fluidized bed<br>
coated (preferably Wurster coating), or in a pan coating system.<br>
The core is suitably coated with a polymeric rate-controlling membrane comprising at least one polymeric material as described above. The core may be coated to a coating level that 20     is sufficient to facilitate the desired release rate.<br>
The rate-controlling membrane can comprise a single polymer or a mixture of two or more polymers.<br>
Oral controlled release formulations of the invention can be in the form of a suspension made with suitable commonly used suspending agents and other auxiliary pharmaceutical 25     excipients.<br>
The rate controlling polymer of the membrane is any one of those herein above specified for the core and includes polymers with varying solubility and permeability to water. "<br>
The oral controlled release lamotrigiae formulation of the invention can be in the form of a multiparticulate formulation or a tablet The term "multiparticulate" as used herein includes 30 discrete particles such as nanoparticles, microspheres, microcapsules, pellets, mini-tablets, granules, beads, spheronized granules and mixtures or combinations thereof. A multiparticulate oral dosage form according to the invention can comprise a blend of one or more populations of particles, pellets or mini-tablets having different in vitro and/or in vivo release characteristics.<br><br>
WO 03/104192		PCT/IN03/00213<br>
For example, the multiparticulate oral dosage form can comprise a blend of an instant or fast release component and controlled release component compressed into a rapidly disintegrating tablet. Fast release components and/or controlled release components can additionally be coated with an enteric coating polymer membrane. Alternatively the blend of instant or fast release and controlled release component contained in a suitable capsule, for example hard or soft gelatin capsules. The multiparticulate formulation may be filled into a capsule and may be administered by swallowing the capsule or by opening said capsule and sprinkling the contents onto food. Alternatively the multiparticulate formulation may be presented in a sachet or other binder that rapidly releases in an aqueous environment.<br>
The particles and one or more auxiliary excipient materials can be compressed into tablet form such as a single or multiple layer tablets. Typically a multiple layer tablet may comprise two layers, which may contain the same or different levels of the same active ingredient having the same or different release characteristics, or may contain different release characteristics.<br>
As indicated above the oral controlled release lamotrigine formulations of the present invention may comprise atrxiliary excipients such as for example diluents, lubricants, surfactants, disintegrants, plasticisers, anti-tack agents, opacifying agents, pigments, flavourings and such like. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the exact choice of excipient and their relative amounts will depend to some extent on the final oral dosage form into which the controlled release lamotrigine formulation is incorporated.<br>
The amount of the auxiliary excipients may comprise from 0.05 to 75 weight % based on the total weight of the formulation, depending on the desired property to be imparted to the formulation.<br>
Suitable diluents include for example pharrnaceutically acceptable inert fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, saccharides, and/or mixtures of the foregoing. Examples of diluents include microcrystalline celluloses such as those  sold under the Trade Mark Avicel pH 101, Avicel pH 102, Avicel pH 112, Avicel pH 200, Avicel pH 301, and Avicel pH 302; lactose such as lactose monohydrate, lactose anhydrous and Pharmatose DCL21 (Pharmatose is a trade mark), including anhydrous, monohydrate and spray dried forms; dibasic calcium phosphate such as Emcompress (Emcompress is a Trade Mark); mannitol; Pearlitol $D 200 (Pearlitol SD 200 is a trade mark); starch; sorbitol; sucrose; and glucose.<br>

To 6.78 of core particles prepared above (without coating of rate controlling<br>
membrane) and 26.69 g of controlled release particles prepared above added 85.06 of mannitol<br>
25     (Pearlitol SD 200 R.T.M.), 6.75 g of crospovidone (Polyplasdone XL 10 R.T.M.), 1.35 g of<br>
talc,2.7 g of magnesium stearate, 1.35 g of aspartame, 1.35 g of banana flavour, 2.7 g of<br>
copolyvidone (Koliidon VA 64 R.T.M.) and 0.262 g of colloidal silicon dioxide, which was<br>
admixed in a bag to give mixed powders.  This mixed powder was tabletted using a Korsch<br>
tabletting machine with a round punch having beveled edges, 12;7 mm in diameter to provide<br>
3 0     tablets each weighing 900mg.<br>
The hardness and disintegration time of each tablet thus obtained was 100-120 N and 40-60 seconds respectively. The dissolution rate of tablets was estimated (Table 14).<br><br><br><br>
