1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br><br><br><br>
        ANIAQUEOUS HAIR STYLING COMPOSITION<br><br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913, and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India,<br>
GRANTED<br>
ORIGINAL 	15-12-2003<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
10 DEC 2003<br><br>
3ACKGROUN0 OF THE INVENT ION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to aqueous hair styling aids, especially hair styling mousses, which incorporate a volatile silicone and which have improved strength and durability of hair hold and superior sensory feel.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Hair styling aids such as hair styling mousses provide human hair with a temporary set which can be removed by water or by shampooing, and function by applying a thin film of a resin or gum onto the hair to adhere adjacent hairs together so that they retain the particular shape or configuration at the time of application.<br>
Conventional hair styling mousses typically utilise a hair styling polymer, water, surfactant and propellant gas, with optional adjuvants such as aesthetic agents, fragrance and hair conditioning agents. The conditioning agents used have included silicone-type materials.<br>
EP 0 523 38B discloses an aqueous hair styling aid or mousse composition incorporating a non-volatile silicone compound or other water-insoluble, emulsifiable conditioning agent. The preferred non-volatile silicone compound is a 3:1 mixture of a low molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane fluid and a higher molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane gum.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
EP 0 205 306 discloses the use of high molecular weight silicone materials in styling mousses. These are defined as polydiorganoailoxanes having a viscosity of at least 100,000 est. The high molecular weight silicone is dissolved in the propellant phase prior to filling the aerosol container.<br>
A problem is that those silicone materials which are typically used as conditioning agents in hair care applications tend to make the hair too soft to form and retain a style.<br>
CA 1 214 106 describes that the use of cyclic silicone fluids in ethanol-based aerosol hairspray compositions provides increased holding power and softer feel compared with formulations containing silicone glycols as plasticising materials for the hairspray resin. However this publication is concerned entirely with ethanol-based systems, and none of the formulations disclosed contain any water. Increasingly with the advent of legislation concerning the volatile organic content of haireprays, it has become desirable to formulate systems with relatively high water content.<br>
EP 0 657 157 Al discloses that particular volatile linear and cyclic alkylmethylsilicones can be substituted for a portion of the water in a low volatile organic content compliant styling aid formulation, and form compatible systems when combined with water and ethanol in certain prescribed ranges of these three ingredients. This publication is concerned specifically with alkylmethylsilicones having in the molecule methyl and alkyl groups which include six, seven or eight carbon atoms.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that the strength and durability of hair hold delivered by a hair styling resin in an aqueous hair styling mousse can be significantly increased by the inclusion in the formulation of certain volatile silicones selected from linear and cyclic dimethylsilicones. Advantageously, hair styling mousses of the invention also exhibit superior sensory feel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
Examples of amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants include alkyl amine oxides/ alkyl betaines, alkyl amidopropyl betaines, alkyl sulphobetaines (sultaines),   alkyl glycinates, alkyl carboxyglycinates, alkyl amphopropionates, alkylamphoglycinates alkyl amidopropyl hydroxysultaines, acyl taurates and acyl glutamates, wherein the alkyl and acyl groups have from 8 to 19 carbon atoms.  Preferred amphoteric surfactants are lauryl amine oxide, cocodimethyl sulphopropyl betaine, lauryl betaine, sodium cocanphopropionate, and especially cocamidopropyl betaine.<br><br>
The surfactants in compositions of the invention are most preferably selected from one or more nonionic surfactants. Surfactants selected from anionic, cationic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants may suitably be used in conjunction with these nonionic surfactants, to improve, for example, foaming power and/or foam stability.<br>
Water<br>
Compositions of the present invention will also include water (preferably distilled or deionised), as a solvent or carrier for the polymers and other components.  Water will typically be present in amounts ranging from 30% to 98%, preferably from 60% to 95%, most preferably from 80% to 95% by weight based on total weight.<br>
Alcohol may optionally be employed as a co-solvent in compositions of the invention as this can enhance the performance of the styling composition.  A suitable alcohol is an aliphatic straight or branched chain monohydric alcohol having 2  to about 4 carbon atoms.  Isopropanol and especially ethanol are preferred. A suitable level for the alcohol is up to  20%, preferably from 5% to 15%, by weight based on total weight.<br>
Product Form<br>
Compositions of the invention may suitably be in aerosol form. A particularly preferred product form is an aerosol hair mousse. Aerosol hair mousse compositions are emitted from the aerosol container as a foam which is then typically worked through the hair with fingers or a hair styling tool and either left on the hair or rinsed out.<br><br>
Aerosol-form compositions of the invention will include an aerosol propellant which serves to expel the other materials from the container, and forms the mousse character in mousse compositions. The aerosol propellant included in styling compositions of the present invention can be any liquefiable gas conventionally used for aerosol containers.  Examples of suitable propellants include dimethyl ether and hydrocarbon propellants such as propane, n-butane and isobutane. The propellants may be used singly or admixed. Water insoluble propellants, especially hydrocarbons, are preferred because they form emulsion droplets on agitation and create suitable mousse foam densities.<br>
The amount of the propellant used is governed by normal factors well known in the aerosol art. For mousses the level of propellant is generally up to 30%, preferably from 2% to 30%, most preferably from 3% to 15% by weight based on total weight of the composition. If a propellant such as dimethyl ether includes a vapour pressure suppressant (e.g. trichloroethane or dichloromethane), for weight percentage calculations, the amount of suppressant is included as part of the propellant.<br>
The method of preparing aerosol hair styling mousse compositions according to the invention follows conventional aerosol filling procedures.  The composition ingredients (not including the propellant) are charged into a suitable pressurisable container which is sealed and then charged with the propellant according to conventional techniques.<br>
Compositions of the invention may also take a non-foaming product form, such as a hair styling cream or gel. Such a cream or gel will include a structurant or thickener,<br><br>
typically at a level of from 0.1% to 10%, preferably 0.5% to 3% by weight based on total weight.<br>
Examples of suitable structurants or thickeners are polymeric thickeners such as carboxyvinyl polymers. A carboxyvinyl polymer is an interpolymer of a monomeric mixture comprising a monomeric olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the total monomers of a polyether of a polyhydric alcohol. Carboxyvinyl polymers are substantially insoluble in liquid, volatile organic hydrocarbons and are dimensionally stable on exposure to air. Suitably the molecular weight of the carboxyvinyl polymer is at least 750,000, preferably at least 1,250,000, most preferably at least 3,000,000. Preferred carboxyvinyl polymers are copolymers of acrylic acid cross-linked with polyallylsucrose as described in US Patent 2,798,053. These polymers are provided by B.F.Goodrich Company as, for example, CARBOPOL 934, 940, 941 and 980. Other materials that can also be used as structurants or thickeners include those that can impart a gel-like viscosity to the composition, such as water soluble or colloidally water soluble polymers like cellulose ethers (e.g. methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose), guar gum, sodium alginate, gum arabic, xanthan gum, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,hydroxypropyl guar gum, starch and starch derivatives, and other thickeners, viscosity modifiers, gelling agents, etc. It is also possible to use inorganic thickeners such as bentonite or laponite clays.<br><br>
The aqueous hair styling aids of the invention can contain a variety of nonessential, optional components suitable for rendering the compositions more aesthetically acceptable or to aid use, including discharge from the container, of the product. Such conventional optional ingredients are well known to those skilled in the art, e.g. preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and imidazolidinyl urea, fatty alcohols such as cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, pH adjusting agents such as citric acid, succinic acid, sodium hydroxide and triethanolamine, colouring agents such as any of the FD&amp;C or D&amp;C dyes, perfume oils, chelating agents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and polymer plasticising agents such as glycerin and propylene glycol.<br>
The invention also provides a method of styling hair by applying thereto an aqueous hair styling aid as is hereinabove described.<br>
