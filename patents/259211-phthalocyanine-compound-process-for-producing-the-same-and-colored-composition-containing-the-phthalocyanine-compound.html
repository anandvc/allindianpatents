DESCRIPTION<br>
PHTHALOCYANINE COMPOUND AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME,<br>
AND COLORING COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE PHTHALOCYANINE<br>
COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a phthalocyanine compound which can be used as a<br>
green pigment, and a method for producing the same, and a coloring composition containing<br>
the phthalocyanine compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Typical examples of a conventionally known green pigment include a<br>
polyhalogenated copper phthalocyanine. Since this polyhalogenated copper<br>
phthalocyanine has excellent fastness properties but has a large amount of halogen atoms<br>
such as chlorine and bromine atoms in the molecule, there have some fear for the safety and<br>
environmental burden, recently. Therefore, it is required to develop a pigment capable of<br>
coloring green with a compound having no halogen atom.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a method of coloring green with a compound having no halogen atom<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "halogen-free"), for example, there is proposed a method<br>
comprising mixing copper phthalocyanine as a blue pigment with a yellow organic pigment,<br>
thereby performing toning to obtain a green pigment, and using the resulting green pigment<br>
(see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-64534).<br><br>
2<br>
However, this method causes a problem that segregation occurs because two kinds of<br>
pigments, each having a quite different chemical structure, are mixed, and also causes a<br>
problem that hue remarkably varies when exposed to sunlight because light resistance varies<br>
depending on the kind of the pigment mixed.<br>
[0004]<br>
On the other hand, as a halogen-free compound which has green hue itself, for<br>
example, a phthalocyanine compound having an imidazole ring represented by the<br>
following general formula (a) (hereinafter referred to as a "compound (a)") (see, for<br>
example, Russian Journal of General Chemistry, 69 (8), 1321 (1999) and Journal of<br>
Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines, 4, 505 (2000)). However, the above problem such as<br>
segregation is solved by the compound (a) in this method, but there was a problem that<br>
resistance to an organic solvent or an acid is insufficient.<br>
[0005]<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br>
wherein M represents a copper atom or two hydrogen atoms, and Ra represents any one of a<br>
hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and a benzyl group.<br><br>
3<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a phthalocyanine compound which<br>
is halogen-free and has green hue, and also has resistance to an organic solvent and an acid.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied so as to achieve the above object<br>
and found that a compound prepared by introducing imidazolone into phthalocyanine is<br>
halogen-free and has green hue, and also has resistance to an organic solvent and an acid.<br>
[0008]<br>
Namely, the present invention provides a phthalocyanine compound represented by<br>
the following general formula (1):<br>
[0009]<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br>
wherein M represents a divalent to tetravalent metal atom or two hydrogen atoms, and rings<br>
A1, A2, A3 and A4 each independently represents a benzene ring or a structure represented<br>
by the following general formula (2), provided that at least one of rings A1, A2, A3 and A4<br>
is a structure represented by the following general formula (2):<br>
[0010]<br><br>
4<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl<br>
group, a tolyl group, or a xylyl group.<br>
[0011]<br>
The phthalocyanine compound of the present invention has green hue and also has<br>
resistance to an organic solvent and an acid, and is therefore useful as a green pigment.<br>
Also, the phthalocyanine compound of the present invention is halogen-free and therefore<br>
has features such as high safety and low environmental burden. Accordingly, the<br>
phthalocyanine compound of the present invention is used very usefully in place of a<br>
halogenated phthalocyanine-based pigment as an existing green pigment in applications<br>
which require environmental measures.<br>
[0012]<br>
The phthalocyanine compound of the present invention can be used as a coloring<br>
agent in wide applications such as printing inks, coating materials, colored plastics, toners,<br>
ink jet inks, and color filters because of having the features described above.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]<br>
Synthesis Examples of a phthalocyanine compound represented by the following<br>
general formula (1) (hereinafter referred to as a "compound (1)") of the present invention<br>
are described below:<br><br>
6<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 4]<br>
wherein M represents a divalent to tetravalent metal atom or two hydrogen atoms, and rings<br>
A1, A2, A3 and A4 each independently represents a benzene ring or a structure represented<br>
by the following general formula (2) (hereinafter referred to as a "benzimidazolone (2)"),<br>
provided that at least one of rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 is benzimidazolone (2):<br>
[0016]<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl<br>
group, tolyl group, or a xylyl group.<br>
[0017]<br>
To synthesize the above compound (1), first, a dicyano benzimidazolone compound<br>
represented by the following general formula (3), which is a dinitrile compound having an<br>
imidazolone ring as the intermediate, is synthesized by the following synthesis method:<br>
[0018]<br><br>
7<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 6]<br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl<br>
group, a tolyl group, or a xylyl group.<br>
[0019]<br>
[Synthesis of Dicyano Benzimidazolone Compound]<br>
The dicyano benzimidazolone compound represented by the general formula (3)<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a "compound (3)") can be obtained by reacting a compound<br>
represented by the following general formula (4) (hereinafter referred to as a "compound<br>
(4)") with urea or 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile at 50 to<br>
130°C for about 1 to 6 hours:<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 7]<br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl<br>
group, a tolyl group, or a xylyl group.<br>
[0021]<br>
The method for synthesizing a compound (4) in which R in the general formula (4)<br>
is a hydrogen atom includes, for example, a method comprising protecting an amino group<br>
of o-phenylenediamine with a tosyl group, brominating moieties at the 4- and 5-positions,<br>
performing deprotection, and reacting with copper cyanide thereby substituting a bromo<br><br>
8<br>
group with a cyano group. This synthesis method is described in detail in Journal of the<br>
Chemical Society, 1170 (1962), and Chemistry-A European Journal, 9 (5), 1233 (2003). A<br>
compound (3) in which R in the general formula (3) is a hydrogen atom can be obtained by<br>
synthesizing the above compound (3) using this compound (4) in which R in the general<br>
formula (4) is a hydrogen atom.<br>
[0022]<br>
Also, the method for synthesizing a compound (4) in which R is other than a<br>
hydrogen atom in the general formula (4) includes, for example, a method comprising<br>
nitrating moieties at the 4- and 5-positions of o-dibromobenzene, reacting with ammonia<br>
thereby reducing one of nitro groups to an amino group, monoalkylating or monoarylating<br>
the amino group, substituting a bromo group with a cyano group, and reducing a nitro group<br>
with tin chloride. This synthesis method is described in detail in Chemical<br>
Communication, 2236 (2002). A compound (3) in which R in the general formula (3) is<br>
other than a hydrogen atom can be obtained by synthesizing the above compound (3) using<br>
this compound (4) in which R in the general formula (4) is other than a hydrogen atom.<br>
[0023]<br>
The compound (1) can be obtained by the following synthesis method (1) using the<br>
compound (3) obtained by the above synthesis method when all substituents of ring A1, A2,<br>
A3 and A4 in the general formula (1) are benzimidazolones (2), or can be obtained by the<br>
following synthesis method (2) when one to three rings among rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 are<br>
benzimidazolones (2) and the remainder are benzene rings.<br>
[0024]<br>
Synthesis Method (1)<br>
The compound (1) in which all of rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 in the general formula<br>
(1) are benzimidazolones (2) can be obtained by thermocondensing the compound (3)<br><br>
9<br>
described above with a metal salt corresponding to a divalent to tetravalent metal atom<br>
represented by M in the general formula (1) in an organic solvent at 130 to 250°C. The<br>
phthalocyanine compound obtained by this synthesis is a phthalocyanine compound as a<br>
metal complex represented by the following general formula (5) (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
"compound (5)"). By using two or more kinds of compounds (3), each having different R<br>
in the general formula (3), it is possible to obtain a phthalocyanine compound in which R1,<br>
R2, R3 and R4 in the following general formula (5) are different. In this synthesis method<br>
(1), by synthesizing without using a metal salt corresponding to the divalent to tetravalent<br>
metal atom, it is possible to obtain a metal-free phthalocyanine compound in which M in the<br>
following general formula (5) represents two hydrogen atoms:<br>
[0025]<br><br>
[Chemical Formula 8]<br>
wherein M represents a divalent to tetravalent metal atom or two hydrogen atoms, and R1 to<br>
R4 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, a phenyl group, a tolyl group, or a xylyl group.<br>
[0026]<br>
The divalent to tetravalent metal atom represented by M in the general formula (1)<br><br>
10<br>
includes, for example, atoms of magnesium, aluminum, titanium, vanadium, iron, cobalt,<br>
nickel, copper, zinc, platinum, and palladium. Among these metal atoms, a copper or zinc<br>
atom is preferable and a zinc atom is more preferable. The divalent to tetravalent metal<br>
atom represented by M in the general formula (1) corresponds to a divalent to tetravalent<br>
metal atom represented by M in the general formula (5).<br>
[0027]<br>
As the metal salt corresponding to the divalent to tetravalent metal atom, for<br>
example, various salts such as halides, acetates, sulfates, nitrates, and carbonates can be<br>
used, and halides and acetates are preferable.<br>
[0028]<br>
The organic solvent used to synthesize the compound (5) includes, for example,<br>
alcohols, glycols, trichlorobenzene, quinoline, a-chloronaphthalene, nitrobenzene, sulfolane,<br>
and N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction may be conducted without using a solvent.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the case of synthesizing the compound (5), an alkali or an organic amine such as<br>
diazabicycloundecene (hereinafter referred to as "DBU") or cyclohexylamine is preferably<br>
used as a catalyst because the yield is improved.<br>
[0030]<br>
Synthesis Method (2)<br>
A compound (1) in which one to three rings among ring A1, A2, A3 and A4 are<br>
benzimidazolones (2) and the others are benzene rings in the general formula (1) can be<br>
obtained by thermocondensing the compound (3) obtained above, phthalonitrile, and a metal<br>
salt corresponding to a divalent to tetravalent metal atom represented by M in the general<br>
formula (1) in an organic solvent at about 130 to 250°C. The phthalocyanine compound<br>
obtained by this synthesis is a phthalocyanine compound as a metal complex represented by<br><br>
11<br>
the following general formula (6) (hereinafter referred to as a "compound (6)"). By using<br>
two or more kinds of compounds (3), each having different R in the general formula (3), it is<br>
possible to obtain a phthalocyanine compound in which each benzimidazolone (2) in rings<br>
B1, B2 and B3 in the following general formula (6) is different. In the synthesis method<br>
(2), by synthesizing without using a metal salt corresponding to the divalent to tetravalent<br>
metal atom, it is possible to obtain a metal-free phthalocyanine compound in which M in the<br>
following general formula (6) represents two hydrogen atoms:<br>
[0031]<br>
[Chemical Formula 9]<br><br>
wherein M represents a divalent to tetravalent metal atom or two hydrogen atoms, and rings<br>
B1, B2 and B3 each independently represents a benzene ring or benzimidazolone (2),<br>
provided that at least one of rings B1, B2 and B3 is benzimidazolone (2).<br>
[0032]<br>
The metal salt corresponding to the divalent to tetravalent metal atom used in this<br>
synthesis method (2), the divalent to tetravalent metal atom, the organic solvent and the<br>
catalyst may be the same as those used in the synthesis method (1).<br>
[0033]<br>
In the above synthesis method (2), when a ratio of the compound (3) and<br><br>
12<br>
phthalonitrile to be charged as raw materials is varied, hue of the finally obtained compound<br>
(6) varies. By increasing a charging ratio of phthalonitrile, the resulting compound (6)<br>
shows more bluish hue and high chroma. Therefore, the charging ratio of phthalonitrile<br>
can be appropriately selected so as to obtain desired hue and chroma, but is preferably<br>
within a range from 15 to 75 mass% based on the total amount of the compound (3) and<br>
phthalonitrile.<br>
[0034]<br>
A compound (1) in which imidazolone is introduced into phthalocyanine can be<br>
obtained by the above synthesis method (1) or (2). In this compound (1), since<br>
imidazolone has a carbonyl group, unlike a compound (a) as the above-described<br>
phthalocyanine compound having an imidazole ring, it becomes possible to form an<br>
intermolecular hydrogen bond between this carbonyl group and a hydrogen atom bonded<br>
with a nitrogen atom in imidazolone of the other molecule, resulting in excellent resistance<br>
to an organic solvent and an acid.<br>
[0035]<br>
When all of rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 are benzimidazolones (2) in the general<br>
formula (1), hue of the compound (1) becomes green. On the other hand, when one to<br>
three rings among rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 are benzimidazolones (2) and the remaindered<br>
are benzene rings, hue becomes bluish green. As the number of benzene ring increases in<br>
rings A1, A2, A3 and A4, hue becomes more bluish green. Rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 are<br>
preferably composed of benzimidazolone (2) and a benzene ring because chroma is<br>
enhanced. Furthermore, in benzimidazolone (2), R in the general formula (2) is preferably<br>
a hydrogen atom, because the number of moieties, which form the above intermolecular<br>
hydrogen bond, increases and therefore resistance to an organic solvent and an acid is more<br>
enhanced.<br><br>
13<br>
[0036]<br>
As described above, since hue of the phthalocyanine compound of the present<br>
invention can be varied according to the kind of rings A1, A2, A3 and A4 in the general<br>
formula (1), desired hue can be obtained by appropriately selecting rings A1, A2, A3 and A4<br>
from among benzimidazolone (2) and benzene rings.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the compound (1), phthalocyanine compounds represented by the following<br>
formulas (7-a) to (7-e) are more preferable.<br>
[0038]<br><br>
14<br><br><br>
15<br>
[0039]<br>
By the above synthesis method, the compound (1) is obtained as a green crude<br>
pigment. When the compound is used as a coloring agent, a pigmentation treatment is<br>
preferably conducted. This pigmentation treatment includes, for example, a milling<br>
treatment such as solvent salt milling, salt milling, dry milling, solvent milling, or acid<br>
pasting, or a solvent heating treatment. The particle size of the pigment can be<br>
simultaneously adjusted by these pigmentation treatments.<br>
[0040]<br>
When the phthalocyanine compound of the present invention is used as a green<br>
pigment, the phthalocyanine compound is preferably subjected to the above pigmentation<br>
treatment thereby adjusting the particle size of the pigment within a range from 0.01 to 1 um.<br>
[0041]<br>
The coloring composition of the present invention is a composition containing the<br>
phthalocyanine compound of the present invention as a coloring agent and applications<br>
thereof include printing inks, coating materials, colored plastics, toners, ink jet inks, color<br>
pastes for color filter, and color resists.<br>
