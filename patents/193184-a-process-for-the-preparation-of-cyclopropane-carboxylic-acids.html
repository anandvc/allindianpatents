A process for the preparation of cyclopropane carbox-ylic acids.<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of compounds usable as intermediates in the preparation of cyclopropane carboxylic esters.<br>
Cyclopropane carboxylic est.ers are insecticidally active compounds which are known as "pyrethroids", and since they combine exceptionally good insecticidal properties with very low toxicity to mammals they are of considerable interest. Therefore, much effort has been made in order to find economically favourable routes for preparing them and their most important intermediates.<br>
A selection of these pyrethroid compounds showing a remarkably high activity can be prepared from acids of the general formula II, where the carbon atoms marked 1 and 3 are asymmetrical carbon atoms and where the geometry in the cyclopropane ring is lR,cis, i.e., the absolute configuration at carbon atom 1 is R and the two hydrogen atoms at carbon atoms 1 and 3 are in cis"position. The compounds II can be prepared from the<br><br><br>
The superscripts 1.2 etc in the following description refer to the list of references stated at the end of the present description.<br>
It is known1,2,3 that the acid II should have the geometry lR,cis in order that pyrethroids derived therefrom can obtain maximum insecticidal activity. If R1 and X2 are CF3 and Cl, respectively, it is furthermore known that the chlorine atom and cyclopropane group should be at the same side of the carbon-carbon double bond, Z configuration, in order to obtain maximum insecticidal activity, which is shown in Scheme 1.<br>
Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to prepare the exact isomer of II which provides the most active pyrethroids in a technically as well as economically attractive manner in order to minimize in this way the applied amount of active substance (insecticide) in the treatment of agricultural crops, habitations and the like.<br>
The preparation of II of the desired lR,cis configuration takes place from the intermediate I where the configuration is already present. In addition to the asymmetric centres at positions 1 and 5, the intermediate I has an asymmetric carbon atom at position 4, which means that I can occur in the two configurations 1R,4R,5S and 1R,4S,5S where, however, the synthesis of I preferably leads to 1R,4R,5S. In the further reaction of I both configurations lead to II.<br>
The desired configuration of I at carbon atoms 1 and 5 is obtained through known synthetic steps from the natural product A-3-carene4,5,6,7 which in the terminology of chiral chemistary is said to belong to "the chiral pool", i.e. the collection of relatively inexpensive and readily available natural substances of a<br><br>
described configuration among which one can find starting materials of a particular, desired configuration.<br>
It is known ' that the reduction I -&gt; II can be carried out by metallic zinc or other metals (e.g., magnesium) . Reactions corresponding to the transfor-m. ion I -&gt; II are called "elimination of β-halo esters" and can be carried out under different conditions10. A comprehensive review work10 discusses several possible sets of conditions for carrying out such reactions, inter alia, reaction with Zn and electrolysis. Reac-tants equal or analogous to those used in the present invention are not mentioned.<br>
Apparently, previously described8 trans-β-bromo-acetoxy elimination reactions are only practicable on systems wherein bromine is further activated by an ester group, since experiments under the conditions described (NaHSO3, Na2SO3) gave, for the starting compound I (R1 = x1 = X2 = Br), only a little II (R1 = X2 = Br) and more III (R2 = X2 = Br) (see Scheme 2) together with unreacted starting compound- Experiments under the conditions described (NaHSO3 , NaHCO3) gave no reaction for I (R1 = CF3; X1 = X2 = C1) , not even in the presence of a catalyst (Pt).<br>
However, it has unexpectedly been found that just the halolactone I in the presence of metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, or Os) can be reduced to the cyclopropane carboxylic acid II by using formate (HCOO"), hypophosphite (H2PO2-) , phosphite (HPO32-) or hydrogen (H ) , respectively, as reducing agent.<br>
Simultaneously, it has unexpectedly been found that if R1  = CF3  and X1 = X2 = Cl, the product II<br>
consists predominantly of the desired Z-isomer.<br>
This synthetic route is totally specific in respect of the stereoisomerism of the products so that the geometry of I can be found again in the product II.<br><br>
In this way costly racemate resolutions as well as yield losses to useless isomers are avoided.<br>
Previous attempts9 to reduce similar halolactone systems with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst [Pd(C)5%] resulted in simple dehalogenation only, with the lactone ring being maintained.<br>
Here is described a number of new synthetic methods for the preparation of the (IR,cis)-acid moiety of the pyrethroid esters of formula II from the halolactone I. These synthetic methods can be used in the same way to prepare the racemic {IRS,cis)-acid moiety of the pyrethroid esters from racemic halolactones which in turn are synthesized from racemic Biocartol.<br>
In accordance with the above the invention relates to a process for the preparation of cyclopropane carboxylic acids of the general formula II, wherein the substituent R1 represents a halogen atom, preferably C1 or Br, or haloalkyl (halo in haloalkyl being, e.g., fluoro, chloro or bromo, and alkyl in haloalkyl being suitably a lower alkyl such as alkyl having 1-3 carbon atoms) , preferably CF , and the substituent X2 represents a halogen atom, preferably CI or Br, where R1 and X2 may be the same or different, and wherein the configuration of II predominantly is Z for R1 = CF3 and X2 = C1, which process is characterized by reacting, in the presence of a catalyst, a compound of the general formula I, wherein the substituents R1 and X2 are as defined above, and the substituent X1 represents a halogen atom, preferably C1 or Br, where R , X1 and X2 may be the same or different, with a compound which is a hydrogen donor.<br>
A great advantage of the present invention is that the use of expensive reducing agents such as Zn or other metals can be avoided and that, e.g., hydrogen can be used instead.<br><br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that, as by-products, carbon dioxide (CO ) + sodium chloride (NaCl) , phosphorous acid (H PO ) + sodium chloride (NaCl) , phosphoric acid (H PC ) + sodium chloride (NaCl) or hydrochloric acid (HCl), respectively, are obtained instead of zinc ions or other metal ions.<br>
Zinc is an element for which maximum concentrations have been set, if it is to be discharged with wastewater or spread with sludge from a purification plant. This means that a production using zinc in major amounts will have to incorporate an expenditure demanding step for recovering the applied zinc. The same conditions apply to other metals.<br>
Use can be made of various appropriate embodiments of the process of the invention as stated in claims 2-7.<br>
The process of the invention and its various embodiments are caracteristic by being ideal and not previously described for the preparation of II from I.<br>
By suitably selecting solvent, temperature, calatyst and pH level in the reaction mixture, it is possible to minimize the occurrence of undesirable byproducts of the general formulae III, IV and/or V:<br><br><br>
R2 represents hydrogen (H) , a halogen atom (e.g., C1 or Br) or haloalkyl (e.g., CF ) . X1 represents a halogen atom (e.g., Cl or Br) . R2 and X1 may be the same or different.<br>
By selecting solvent, temperatur, catalyst and pH level in the reaction mixture it is likewise possible to control the reaction to preferably give the desired Z- or E-isomer of II.<br>
NMR and HPLC analyses of the end product II (R1 = CF ; X = Cl) show that there is preferably isolated Z - i somer, usual ly more than 9 5 % of Z - isomer, and the crude product is easily purified to be more than 99% of Z-isomer. However, in most cases it holds that a content &gt;95% of Z-isomer is satisfactory. A costly further purification can therefore be avoided, which is not the case when II (R1 = CF3; X2 = Cl) is prepared via the conventional metal reduction.<br>
In the reduction of I to II use can be made of formate (in the form of a metal salt, ammonium salt or other salts) , hypophosphite (in the form af a metal salt, ammonium salt or other salts) and phosphite (in the form of a metal salt, ammonium salt or other salts). These three agents are often used in the reactions named "transfer hydrogenation". In the reduction of I to II gaseous hydrogen can alternatively be used. If hydrogen is used as reducing agent, the reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure as well as at elevated pressure, e.g., confined in an autoclave.<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out in a solvent or in mixtures of solvents, the properties of which can vary much. Both protic and aprotic solvents are used, and among the usable aprotic solvents both polar and nonpolar ones exist. Suitable as a solvent for reac-i tions with formate, hypophosphite and phosphite are<br><br>
alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethylene glycol) with more or less water or DMF admixed therewith. Suitable as a solvent for reactions with hydrogen are alcohols (e.g., methanol and 2-methoxyethanol) and aprotic, polar solvents (e.g., DMF, DMSO and acetonitrile) with more or less water admixed therewith. The concentration of the reaction components in the solvent or solvent mixture may be in the range of 1-80% and is typically in the range of 10-30%.<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out in the presence of a metal catalyst. Suitable as a catalyst are transition metals, e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh and Os. The catalyst can be finely divided as small particles or finely divided on activated carbon or other inert carrier materials.<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out within a wide pH range, but advantageously in an alkaline medium which is obtained by adding to the reaction mixture pH adjusting compounds (e.g., NaOH, ammonia, amines, NaHCO., Na2CO3., NaH2PO4, and Na.HPO.) . The pH adjustment can be carried out by a pH-meter provided with a titrator, the reservoir of which has been provided with aqueous solutions of said pH adjusting compounds.<br>
The reduction reaction is carried out in a wide temperature range and not unexpected the reaction proceeds faster at higher temperature. Within the range 0-100oC, preferably 20-70oC, a reasonable reaction rate is obtained. In the conversion of I (R1 = CF2; X1 = X2 = C1) into II (R = CF.; X. = CI) it is of importance to obtain a high content of the Z-isomer. It has been found that lower temperature promotes the content of the Z-isomer (at, e.g., 20oC there is obtained Z/E &gt;30) .<br>
