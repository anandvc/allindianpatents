				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to the field of organometal catalyst compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
By "consisting essentially of* herein it is intended to mean that the process<br>
steps, substance or mixture of substances recited after this phrase does not include any<br>
further respective steps or components which would materially affect the functioning of<br>
the process or the properties of the substance or combination of substances produced by<br>
the process or recited after this phrase.<br>
The production of polymers is a multi-billion dollar business. This<br>
business produces billions of pounds of polymers each year. Millions of dollars have been<br>
spent on developing technologies that can add value to this business.<br>
One of these technologies is called metallocene catalyst technology.<br>
Metallocene catalysts have been known since about 1960. However, their low<br>
productivity did not allow them to be commercialized. About 1975, it was discovered that<br>
contacting one part water with one part trirnethylaluminum to form methyl aluminoxane,<br>
and then contacting such methyl aluminoxane with a metallocene compound, formed a<br>
metallocene catalyst that had greater activity. However, it was soon realized that large<br>
amounts of expensive methyl aluminoxane were needed to form an active metallocene<br>
catalyst. This has been a significant impediment to the commercialization of metallocene<br>
catalysts.<br>
Borate compounds have been used in place of large amounts of methyl<br>
aluminoxane. However, this is not satisfactory, since borate compounds are very sensitive<br>
to poisons and decomposition, and can also be very expensive.<br>
It should also be noted that having a heterogeneous catalyst is important.<br>
This is because heterogeneous catalysts are required for most modern commercial<br>
polymerization processes. Furthermore, heterogeneous catalysts can lead to the formation<br>
of substantially uniform polymer particles that have a high bulk density. These types of<br>
substantially uniform particles are desirable because they improve the efficiency of<br>
polymer production and transportation. Efforts have been made to produce heterogeneous<br>
metallocene catalysts; however, these catalysts have not been entirely satisfactory.<br>
Therefore, the inventors provide this invention to help solve these<br>
problems.<br>

for example, U.S. Patents 4,939,217; 5,210,352; 5,436,305; 5,401,817; 5,631,335,<br>
5,571,880; 5,191,132; 5,480,848; 5,399,636; 5,565,592; 5,347,026; 5,594,078; 5,498,581;<br>
5,496,781; 5,563,284; 5,554,795; 5,420,320; 5,451,649; 5,541,272; 5,705,478; 5,631,203;<br>
5,654,454; 5,705,579; and 5,668,230; the entire disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Specific examples of such organometal compounds are as follows:<br>
bis(cyclopentadienyl)hamium dichloride;<br>
In this formula, (X5) is a hydrocarbyl having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. Currently,<br>
it is preferred when (X5) is an alkyl having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. However, it<br>
is most preferred when (X5) is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>

tripropylaluminum; <br>
diethylaluminum ethoxide;<br>

diethylaluminum chloride.<br>
Currently, TEA is preferred.<br>
The fluorided silica-alumina comprises silica, alumina and fluoride. The<br>
fluorided silica-alumina is in the form of a particulate solid. Generally, to produce the<br>
fluorided silica-alumina, a silica-alumina is treated with a fluoriding agent, in order to add<br>
fluoride to the silica-alumina. Generally, the fluoride is added to the silica-alumina by<br>
forming a slurry of the silica-alumina in a solution of the fluoriding agent and a suitable<br>
solvent such as alcohol or water. Particularly suitable are one to three carbon atom<br>
alcohols because of their volatility and low surface tension. A suitable amount of the<br>
solution is utilized to provide the desired concentration of fluoride on the silica-alumina<br>
after drying. Drying can be effected by any method known in the art For example, said<br>
drying can be completed by suction filtration followed by evaporation, drying under<br>
vacuum, or by spray drying.<br>
Any organic or inorganic fluoriding agent which can form a surface<br>
fluoride with a silica-alumina can be used in this invention. Suitable fluoriding agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, hydrofluoric acid (HF), ammonium fluoride (NH4F),<br>
ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2), ammonium fluoroborate (NH4BF4), ammonium<br>
silicofiuoride ((NH4)2SiF6), ammonium fluorophosphate (NH4PF5), and mixtures<br>
thereof. The most preferred fluoriding agent is ammonium bifluoride, due to ease of use<br>
and availability. The amount of fluoride present before calcining is generally in the range<br>
of about 2 to about 50% by weight, preferably about 3 to about 25% by weight, and most<br>
preferably, 4 to 20% by weight, where the weight percents are based on the weight of the<br>
fluorided silica-alumina before calcining.<br>
It is important that the fluorided silica-alumina be calcined. The calcining<br>
can be conducted in any suitable ambient. Generally, the calcining is conducted in an<br>
ambient atmosphere, preferably a dry ambient atmosphere, at a temperature in the range<br>
of about 200°C to about 900°C, and for a time in the range of about 1 minute to about 100<br>
hours. Preferably, the fluorided silica-alumina is calcined at temperatures from about<br>
300°C to about 600°C and a time in a range of about 1 hour to about 10 hours, most<br>
preferably, temperatures from 350°C to 550°C and a time in a range of 1 hours to 10<br>
hours.<br>
Optionally, the silica-alumina can be treated with a fluoriding agent during<br>
calcining. Any fluoriding agent capable of contacting the silica-alumina during the<br>
calcining step can be used. In addition to those fluoriding agents described previously,<br>
organic fluoriding agents of high volatility are especially useful. Organic fluoriding<br>
agents of high volatility can be selected from the group consisting of freons,<br>
perfluorohexane, perfluorobenzene, fluoromethane, trifluoroethanol, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Gaseous hydrogen fluoride or fluorine itself can be used. One convenient method<br>
of contacting the silica-alumina is to vaporize a fluoriding agent into a gas stream used to<br>
fluidize the silica-alumina during calcination.<br>
The silica-alumina should have a pore volume greater than about 0.5 cc/g,<br>
preferably greater than about 0.8 cc/g, and most preferably, greater than 1.0 cc/g.<br>
The silica-alumina should have a surface area greater than about 100 m2/g,<br>
preferably greater than about 250 m2/g, and most preferably greater than 350 m^/g.<br>
The silica-alumina of this invention can have an alumina content from<br>
about 5 to about 95%, preferably from about 8 to about 50%, and most preferably from<br>
10% to 30% alumina by weight<br>
The catalyst compositions of this invention can be produced by contacting<br>
the organometal compound, the fluorided silica-alumina, and the organoaluminum<br>
compound, together. This contacting can occur in a variety of ways, such as, for example,<br>
blending. Furthermore, each of these compounds can be fed into a reactor separately, or<br>
various combinatjpns of these compounds can be contacted together before being further<br>
contacted in the reactor, or all three compounds can be contacted together before being<br>
introduced into the reactor.<br>
Currently, one method is to first contact an organometal compound and a<br>
fluorided silica-alumina together, for about 1 minute to about 24 hours, preferably, 1<br>
minute to 1 hour, at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C, preferably 15°C to<br>
80°C, to form a first mixture, and then contact this first mixture with an organoaluminum<br>
compound to form the catalyst composition.<br>
Preferably, the organometal compound, the organoaluminum compound,<br>
and the fluorided silica-alumina are precontacted before injection into the reactor for<br>
about 1 minute to about 24 hours, preferably, 1 minute to 1 hour, at a temperature from<br>
about 10°C to about 200°C, preferably 20°C to 80°C, in order to obtain high-activity.<br>
A weight ratio of organoaluminum compound to the fluorided silica-<br>
alumina in the catalyst composition ranges from about 5:1 to about 1:1000, preferably,<br>
from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and most preferably, from 1:1 to 1:50.<br>
A weight ratio of the fluorided silica-alumina to the organometal<br>
compound in the catalyst composition ranges from about 10,000:1 to about 1:1,<br>
preferably, from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and most preferably, from about 250:1 to<br>
20:1. These ratios are based on the amount of the components combined to give the<br>
catalyst composition.<br>
After contacting, the catalyst composition comprises a post-contacted<br>
organometal compound, a post-contacted organoaluminum compound, and a post-<br>
contacted fluorided silica-alumina. It should be noted that the post-contacted fluorided<br>
silica-alumina is the majority, by weight, of the catalyst composition. Often times,<br>
specific components of a catalyst are not known, therefore, for this invention, the catalyst<br>
composition is described as comprising post-contacted compounds.<br>
The catalyst composition of this invention has an activity greater than a<br>
catalyst composition that uses the same organometal compound, and the same<br>
organoaluminum compound, but uses alumina, silica, or silica-alumina that has not been<br>
impregnated with fluoride as shown in control examples 3-7. Furthermore, the catalyst<br>
composition of this invention has an activity greater than a catalyst composition that uses<br>
the same organometal compound, and the same organoaluminum compound, but uses a<br>
fluorided silica or a fluorided alumina as shown in control examples 9-10. This activity is<br>
measured under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the diluent, and with<br>
a polymerization temperature of about 50 to about 150ºC, and an ethylene pressure of<br>
about 400 to about 800 psig. When comparing activities, polymerization runs should<br>
occur at the same polymerization conditions. The reactor should have substantially no<br>
indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling.<br>
However, it is preferred if the activity is greater than about 1000 grams of<br>
polymer per gram of fluorided silica-alumina per hour, more preferably greater than about<br>
2000, even more preferably greater than 5000, and most preferably greater than 8,000.<br>
This activity is measured under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the<br>
diluent, and with a polymerization temperature of 90°C, and an ethylene pressure of 550<br>
psig. The reactor should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or<br>
other forms of fouling.<br>
One of the important aspects of this invention is that no aluminoxane<br>
needs to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. Aluminoxane is an expensive<br>
compound that greatly increases polymer production costs. This also means that no watei<br>
is needed to help form such aluminoxanes. This is beneficial because water can<br>
sometimes kill a polymerization process. Additionally, it should be noted that no borate<br>
compounds need to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. In summary, this<br>
means that the catalyst composition, which is heterogenous, and which can be used for<br>
polymerizing monomers or monomers and one or more comonomers, can be easily and<br>
inexpensively produced because of the absence of any aluminoxane compounds or borate<br>
compounds. Additionally, no organochromium compound needs to be added, nor any<br>
MgCl2 needs to be added to form the invention. Although aluminoxane, borate<br>
compounds, organochromium compounds, or MgCl2 are not needed in the preferred<br>
embodiments, these compounds can be used in other embodiments of this invention.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, a process comprising contacting<br>
at least one monomer and the catalyst composition to produce at least one polymer is<br>
provided. The term "polymer" as used in this disclosure includes homopolymers and<br>
copolymers. The catalyst composition can be used to polymerize at least one monomer to<br>
produce a homopolymer or a copolymer. Usually, homopolymers are comprised of<br>
monomer residues, having 2 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule, preferably 2 to about<br>
10 carbon atoms per molecule. Currently, it is preferred when at least one monomer is<br>
selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 1-<br>
pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1-heptene,<br>
1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and mixtures thereof.<br>
When a homopolymer is desired, it is most preferred to polymerize<br>
ethylene or propylene. When a copolymer is desired, the copolymer comprises monomer<br>
residues and one or more comonomer residues, each having from about 2 to about 20<br>
carbon atoms per molecule. Suitable comonomers include, but are not limited to,<br>
aliphatic 1-olefins having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, such as, for example,<br>
propylene, l-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and other olefins<br>
and conjugated or nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, piperylene,<br>
2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,7-hexadiene, and other such diolefins and<br>
mixtures thereof. When a copolymer is desired, it is preferred to polymerize ethylene and<br>
at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-<br>
hexene, 1 -octene, and 1 -decene. The amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor<br>
zone to produce a copolymer is generally from about 0.01 to about 10 weight percent<br>
comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer, preferably, about<br>
0.01 to about 5, and most preferably, 0.1 to 4. Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give<br>
the above described concentrations, by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
Processes that can polymerize at least one monomer to produce a polymer<br>
are known in the art, such as, for example, slurry polymerization, gas phase<br>
polymerization, and solution polymerization. It is preferred to perform a slurry<br>
polymerization in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization<br>
are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction<br>
conditions. The term "diluent" as used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an<br>
inert material; it is possible that a diluent can contribute to polymerization. Suitable<br>
hydrocarbons include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane,<br>
n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Furthermore, it is most preferred to use<br>
isobutane as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of such technology can be<br>
found in U.S. Patents 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; the<br>
entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The catalyst compositions used in this process produce good quality<br>
polymer particles without substantially fouling the reactor. When the catalyst composition<br>
is to be used in a loop reactor zone under slurry polymerization conditions, it is preferred<br>
when the particle size of the solid oxide compound is in the range of about 10 to about<br>
1000 microns, preferably about 25 to about 506 microns, and most preferably, 50 to 200<br>
microns, for best control during polymerization.<br>
In a more specific embodiment of this invention, a process is provided to<br>
produce a catalyst composition, the process comprising {optionally, "consisting essentially<br>
of, or "consisting of):<br>
(1) contacting a silica-alumina with water containing ammonium<br>
bifluoride to produce a fluorided silica-alumina;<br>
(2) calcining the fluorided silica-alumina at a temperature within a range<br>
of 350 to 550°C to produce a calcined composition having 4 to 20 weight percent fluoride<br>
based on the weight of the fluorided silica-alumina before calcining;<br>
(3) combining said calcined composition and bis(n-butylcyclopenta<br>
dienyl) zirconium dichloride at a temperature within the range of 15°C to 80°C to produce<br>
a mixture; and<br>
(4) after between 1 minute and 1 hour, combining said mixture and<br>
triethylaluminum to produce said catalyst composition.<br>
Hydrogen can be used in this invention in a polymerization process to<br>
control polymer molecular weight<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various articles,<br>
such as, for example, household containers and utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks,<br>
pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form these articles. Usually,<br>
additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. It is<br>
believed that by using the invention described herein, articles can be produced at a lower<br>
cost, while maintaining most, if not all, of the unique properties of polymers produced<br>
with metallocene catalysts.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
TESTING METHODS<br>
A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument"<br>
was used to determined surface areas and pore volumes. This instrument was acquired<br>
from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y.<br>
PREPARATION OF OXIDE COMPOUNDS FOR CONTROL EXAMPLES 3-7<br>
Silica was obtained from W.R.Grace, grade 952, having a pore volume of<br>
1.6 cubic centimeter per gram (cc/g) and a surface area of about 300 square meters per<br>
gram (m2/g).<br>
About 10 grams of the silica were placed in a 1.75 inch quartz tube fitted<br>
with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the silica was supported on the disk, dry<br>
air was blown up through the disk at the linear rate of about 1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet<br>
per hour. An electric furnace around the quartz tube was then turned on, and the<br>
temperature was raised at the rate of 400°C per hour to a temperature of 600°C. At this<br>
temperature, the silica was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air. Afterward,<br>
the silica was collected and stored under dry nitrogen. The silica did not have any<br>
exposure to the atmosphere.<br>
Alumina sold as Ketjen grade B alumina from Akzo Nobel was obtained<br>
having a pore volume of about 1.78 cc/g and a surface area of about 340 m2/g. Alumina<br>
samples were prepared by the procedure described previously for the silica except the<br>
alumina samples were calcined at 400°C, 600°C, and 800°C.<br>
A silica-alumina was obtained from W.R.Grace as MS 13-110 containing<br>
13% alumina and 87% silica. The silica-alumina had a pore volume of 1.2 cc/g and a<br>
surface area of about 400 m2/g. Silica-alumina samples were prepared as described<br>
previously for the silica.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF POLYMER IZATIONS RUNS<br>
Polymerization runs were made in a 2.2 liter steel reactor equipped with a<br>
marine stirrer running at 400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The reactor was surrounded by<br>
a steel jacket containing boiling methanol with a connection to a steel condenser. The<br>
boiling point of the methanol was controlled by varying nitrogen pressure applied to the<br>
condenser and jacket, which permitted precise temperature control to within ±0.5°C, with<br>
the help of electronic control instruments.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, first, an oxide compound or fluorided silica-<br>
alumina was charged under nitrogen to a dry reactor. Next, two milliliters of a solution<br>
containing 0.5 grams of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride per 100<br>
milliliters of toluene were added by syringe. Then, 1.2 liters of isobutane were charged to<br>
the reactor, and the reactor was then heated up to 90°C. One milliliter, or two milliliters,<br>
of TEA or ethyl aluminum dichloride (EADC) was added midway during the isobutane<br>
addition. Finally, ethylene was added to the reactor to equal 550 psig, which was<br>
maintained during the experiment. The stirring was allowed to continue for the specified<br>
time, and the activity was noted by recording the flow of ethylene into the reactor to<br>
maintain pressure.<br>
After the allotted time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor<br>
slowly depressurized and opened to recover a granular polymer. In all cases, the reactor<br>
was clean with no indication of any wall scale, coating, or other forms of fouling. The<br>
polymer was then removed, dried, and weighed.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-2 (CONTROLS)<br>
This example demonstrates that an organometal compound added to the<br>
reactor with TEA or EADC does not provide any activity.<br>
A polymerization run was made as described previously except no oxide<br>
compound was added. Ethylene was added, but no activity was seen. After one hour of<br>
stirring, the reactor was depressurized and opened, but in each case no polymer was<br>
found. These results are shown in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLES 3-7 (CONTROLS)<br>
This experiment demonstrates the use of different oxide compounds, an<br>
organometal compound, and TEA.<br>
Each of the oxide compounds described previously was added to the<br>
reactor, followed by the organometal compound and TEA solutions as used in the<br>
procedure discussed previously. These runs are shown in Table 1.<br>
Silica produced almost no polymer. Alumina, which is regarded as more<br>
acidic than the silica, produced more polymer, but still the activity was very low. This was<br>
true of all three different activation temperatures tested. The silica-alumina also exhibited<br>
only very low activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 (CONTROL AND INVENTIVE RUNS)<br>
The following catalyst compositions were produced to demonstrate this<br>
invention at different loadings of ammonium bi fluoride and at different calcination<br>
temperatures.<br>
A small amount of a silica-alumina, sold as MS 13-110 by W.R. Grace<br>
Company having a surface area of 400 m2/g and a pore volume of 1.2 cc/g, was<br>
impregnated with about twice its weight of water containing ammonium bifluoride<br>
dissolved in it to produce a fluorided silica-alumina. For example, fifty grams of the<br>
silica-alumina was impregnated with 100 milliliters of an aqueous solution containing 5<br>
grams of ammonium bifluoride for a 10 weight percent loading of ammonium bifluoride.<br>
This resulted in a wet sand consistency.<br>
The fluorided silica-alumina was then placed in a vacuum oven and dried<br>
overnight at 110°C under half an atmosphere of vacuum. The final step was to calcine 10<br>
grams of the fluorided silica-alumina in dry fluidizing air at the required temperature for<br>
three hours. The fluorided silica-alumina was then stored under nitrogen until a small<br>
quantity was charged to the reactor with an organometal compound and TEA as described<br>
previously in this disclosure.<br>
These runs are shown in Table 2, and they are plotted graphically in Figure<br>
1. Table 3 shows the most active run from each loading, regardless of its calcining<br>
temperature plotted against ammonium bifluoride loading. These results are plotted<br>
graphically in Figure 2.<br>
As can be seen from the data in Table 3, excellent catalyst activity was<br>
observed when the ammonium bifluoride loading was from about 5 to about 35% by<br>
weight with a calcining temperature of from about 300°C to about 600°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 (CONTROL)<br>
The procedure of example 8 was repeated, except that instead of a silica-<br>
alumina, a silica was used instead.<br>
A grade 952 silica obtained from W.R. Grace was impregnated with 10%<br>
ammonium bifluoride as described previously in this disclosure to produce a fluorided silica.<br>
The silica has a surface area of about 300 m2/g and a pore volume of about 1.6 cc/g. The<br>
fluorided silica was then calcined at 450°C for three hours in dry air and tested for<br>
polymerization activity. It exhibited no activity at all.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 (CONTROL)<br>
The procedure of example 8 was repeated, except that instead of silica-alumina, an<br>
alumina was used instead.<br>
An alumina called Ketjen grade B obtained from Akzo Nobel was impregnated<br>
with various loadings of ammonium bifluoride to produce a fluorided alumina as described<br>
previously. The alumina has a surface area of about 400 m2/g and a pore volume of about<br>
1.6 cc/g. The fluorided alumina samples were then calcined at 450°C or 500°C for three<br>
hours in dry air and tested for polymerization activity as described previously in this<br>
disclosure. These results are shown in Table 4. The activity of the fluorided alumina<br>
samples is considerably below the activity shown in the inventive runs using a fluorided<br>
silica-alumina.<br>
* Activity is in units of grams of polymer/gram of fluorided alumina charged per hour.<br>
While this invention has been described in detail for the purpose of<br>
illustration, it is not intended to be limited thereby but is intended to cover all changes and<br>
modifications within the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
