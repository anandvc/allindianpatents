				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
INK RIBBON WINDING CORE, INK RIBBON CASSETTE AND INK RIBBON<br>
CASSETTE HOLDING MECHANISM OF THERMAL TRANSFER PRINTER<br>
Technical _Fiel_d:_<br>
The present invention relates to an ink ribbon winding<br>
core and an ink ribbon cassette used in a thermal transfer<br>
printer .<br>
further, the invention relates to an ink ribbon cassette<br>
holding mechanism for strongly holding an ink ribbon cassette<br>
in a thermal transfer printer.<br>
Generally, in order to show a category or a function<br>
of an electric wire integrated to an electric equipment of<br>
a switchboard or the like, a character or a sign is indicated<br>
on the electric wire. In that case, since the character or<br>
the sign cannot be printed directly on the electric wire, the<br>
character or the sign is printed on a short tube and the electric<br>
wire is inserted through the tube to indicate the character<br>
or the sign. Further, a tape indicating a character or a content<br>
is labeled on a backbone of a book or a binder and also the<br>
tape is printed with a character of a title or the like on<br>
a surfact: thereof.<br>
In any of the cases, printing is carried out by a thermal<br>
transfer printer and according to the thermal transfer printer,<br>
the tube or the tape is pressed to a surface of a material<br>
to be printed of a platen roller or the like, an ink ribbon<br>
and a printing head are pressed thereon and a character or<br>
a sign is thermally transcribed to the tube or the tape by<br>
melting ink of the ink ribbon.<br>
Before mounting an ink ribbon cassette to the printer,<br>
a core for extracting the ink ribbon and a core of reeling<br>
the ink ribbon are brought into a free state and therefore,<br>
there is a case in which winding of the ribbon wound around<br>
the core is slackened and when the ink ribbon is set to the<br>
printer under the state, a drawback may be brought about in<br>
printing the character. Further, since the ink ribbon is an<br>
expendable item, the used ink ribbon needs to be removed and<br>
a new one thereof needs to charge, and according to a background<br>
art, there is adopted a cassette charging system previously<br>
containing the ink ribbon in the cassette and charging the<br>
ink ribbon to the printer along with the cassette.<br>
As an advantage of the cassette system, a thin ink<br>
ribbon is easy to handle and performance of charging the ink<br>
ribbon is excellent. On the other hand, as a disadvantage,<br>
when the ink ribbon is used up, a whole of the cassette is<br>
abandoned, the environment is deteriorated thereby and also<br>
a unit price thereof is high.<br>
In contrast to the cassette system, there is a core<br>
winding charging system of interchanging only the ink ribbon<br>
wound around the core. Although handling thereof differs from<br>
that, of 1 he cassette system, the unit price is inexpensive,<br>
abandoned parts are few and therefore, load on the environment<br>
is reduced.<br>
further, when the above-described ink ribbon cassette<br>
is mounted to the thermal transfer printer, the ink ribbon<br>
cassette needs to be held to be unmoved. Therefore, in the<br>
background art, the ink ribbon cassette is pressed or engaged<br>
to hold by elasticity of a member made of a synthetic resin.<br>
Meanwhile, there is an ink ribbon cassette formed with<br>
a detent for engaging with an ink ribbon shaft by forming a<br>
notch at a portion of a cassette vessel such that an ink ribbon<br>
at inside thereof is not rotated spontaneously when the ink<br>
ribbon cassette is not mounted thereto. The cassette having<br>
the detent of this kind is constructed by a constitution of<br>
releasing engagement of a tape reel by pushing up the detent<br>
by a tape reel rotating shaft provided at a main body of a<br>
printer by mounting the tape reel to the main body of the printer .<br>
According to the system, in releasing the engagement, a force<br>
of pushing up the detent exerted to the ink ribbon cassette<br>
is considerable and therefore, the ink ribbon cassette cannot<br>
sufficiently be held by the holding mechanism constituted by<br>
the synthetic resin material of the background art.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is a first problem of the invention to resolve the<br>
above-described problem and provide a thermal transfer ink<br>
ribbon cassette capable of eliminating slack in reeling when<br>
an ink ribbon is not mounted thereto by a minimum number of<br>
parts and capable of corresponding to a cassette system and<br>
a core winding system.<br>
Further, it is a second problem thereof to provide<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention:<br>
First, an explanation will be given particularly of<br>
an ink ribbon cassette holding mechanism and an ink ribbon<br>
cassette with regard to a constitution of a thermal transfer<br>
printer according to the invention in reference to Fig. I through<br>
Fig. 7.<br>
In Fig. 1, numeral 101 designates a main body of a<br>
thermal transfer printer. The thermal transfer printer main<br>
body 101 is provided with a platen roller 102 and a printing<br>
head 103. The platen roller 102 is fixed to a const ant position.<br>
The printing head 103 is provided to the printer main body<br>
pivotably in a horizontal direction and is urged to separate<br>
from the platen roller 102 by a spring, not illustrated. Further,<br>
the printing head 103 is engaged with an erecting piece 105<br>
of the first sliding member 104. Therefore, the printing head<br>
103 is made to be movable in a direction of pressing or separating<br>
from the platen roller 102 by sliding the first sliding member<br>
104 .<br>
The platen roller 102 and the printing head 103 may<br>
relatively be moved in the direction of pressing each other<br>
or separating from each other. Therefore, there may be<br>
constructed a constitution in which the platen roller 102 is<br>
moved cooperatively with the first sliding member 104 to thereby<br>
move the platen roller 102 in the direction of pressing or<br>
separating from the fixed printing head 103.<br>
Next, the thermal transfer printer main body 101 is<br>
provided with two pieces of rotating shafts 106, 107 and the<br>
ink ribbon cassette 108 is mounted to the rotating shafts 106,<br>
107. An ink ribbon 109 and a winding reel 110 thereof are<br>
arranged to contain at inside of the ink ribbon cassette 108.<br>
Further, as shown by Fig. 2, at vicinities of a bottom wall<br>
111 of the cassette 108, side walls at two end portions in<br>
correspondence with a line P traversing an interval between<br>
the ink ribbon 109 and the winding reel 110 are notched to<br>
form engagement receiving portions 112, 113 and one end portion<br>
thereof is formed with a through hole 114.<br>
Further, a lower portion of the ink ribbon cassette<br>
108 is arranged with the second sliding member 115 in a plate-like<br>
shape . The second sliding member 115 is preferably constituted<br>
by a material having a high strength of a metal or the like<br>
and as shown, by Fig. 3 (a), both ends of one side thereof are<br>
formed with a pair of the engaging portions 118, 119. Each<br>
of the engaging portions 118, 1119 comprises an erected erecting<br>
piece 116 and an engaging claw 117 formed to project from a<br>
front end of the erecting piece 116 in a horizontal direction<br>
and formed in an inverse L-like shape by the erecting piece<br>
116 and the engaging piece 117. An inner side of each engaging<br>
claw 117 is formed with an inclined portion 120 inclined from<br>
a base portion to a front end thereof. Further, the second<br>
sliding member 115 is urged to move to a side of the first<br>
sliding member 104 always by a tension spring 121.<br>
The engagement receiving portions 112, 113 at two ends<br>
of the ink ribbon cassette 108 are formed to be mounted to<br>
positions in correspondence with the engaging portions 118,<br>
119 of the second sliding member 115 in mounting.<br>
Further, as shown by Fig. 4, a front end side of the<br>
second sliding member 115 is formed with a hole 122 substantially<br>
in a triangular shape and triangular hole 122 is engaged with<br>
a projected shaft 123 formed at a front end of the first sliding<br>
member 104. Thereby, the second sliding member 115 is<br>
constituted to slide cooperatively with the first sliding member<br>
104 in a constant range. Further, an amount of sliding the<br>
first sliding member 104 is set to about twice of an amount<br>
of sliding the second sliding member 115.<br>
In the above-described constitution, in interchanging<br>
an ink ribbon, the first sliding member 104 is slid to the<br>
right side of the drawing by pertinent means and as shown by<br>
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, and the platen roller 102 and the printing<br>
head 103 are moved to separate from each other. When the first<br>
sliding member 104 is slid in this way, the projected shaft<br>
123 is disposed at an initial side of the triangular hole 122<br>
of the second sliding member 115, that is, on a side of the<br>
first sliding member 104 and at a position shown in Fig. 4<br>
and therefore, the projected shaft 123 is moved only on the<br>
inner side of the triangular hole 122 until sliding by about<br>
a half of the sliding amount and therefore, the second sliding<br>
member 115 remains unmoved. When the first sliding member<br>
104 exceeds the half of the sliding amount, the projected shaft<br>
123 is brought into contact with a wall at a depth side of<br>
the triangular hole 112 shown in Fig. 5 and therefore, when<br>
the projected shaft 123 is moved further, the projected shaft<br>
123 presses the second sliding member 115 and also the second<br>
sliding member 115 is moved cooperatively with the first sliding<br>
member 104 against a spring force of the tension spring 121<br>
to move to the position of Fig. 6.<br>
Next, the ink ribbon 109 is extracted from between<br>
the platen roller 102 and the printing head 103, a used one<br>
of the ink ribbon cassette 108 is removed and a new one of<br>
the ink ribbon cassette 108 is made to pass a rotating shaft<br>
of the thermal transfer printer main body 101 to mount. At<br>
this occasion, as shown by Fig . 3 (a) , one of the engaging portions<br>
118 of the second sliding member 115 is made to pass the through<br>
hole 114 of the bottom wall 111 of the ink ribbon cassette<br>
108 to a middle portion thereof. Further, after setting the<br>
material to be printed (not illustrated) between the printing<br>
head 103 and the platen roller 102 and thereafter, the first<br>
sliding member 104 is slid in a reverse direction to move the<br>
printing head 103 to press the platen roller 102.<br>
Although when the first sliding member 104 is slid,<br>
as shown by Fig. 6, the projected shaft 123 is disposed on<br>
the depth side of the triangular hole 122 of the second sliding<br>
member 115, as shown by Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 (b) , the second sliding<br>
member 115 is always urged to move to the side of the first<br>
sliding member 104 by the spring force of the tension spring<br>
121 and therefore, also the second sliding member 115 is moved<br>
cooperatively with the first sliding member 104. Although<br>
when the second sliding member 115 is moved by the spring force,<br>
also the engaging portions 118 and 119 are moved in the same<br>
direction and the inclined portions 120 of the engaging claws<br>
117 of the engaging portions 118, 119 are engaged with the<br>
engagement receiving portions 112 and 113 of the bottom wall<br>
111 of the ink ribbon cassette 108, since the bottom wall 111<br>
is pressed downwardlyby the inclined portions 120 of the engaging<br>
claws 117, the ink ribbon cassette 108 is held solidly.<br>
At a time point of engaging in this way, the second<br>
sliding member 115 is stopped at a position of Fig. 5 and is<br>
not moved further. Meanwhile, the first sliding member 104<br>
is further moved and therefore, the projected shaft 123 is<br>
moved to the initial side of the triangular hole 122 and the<br>
printing head 103 is pressed to the platen roller 102 as shown<br>
by Fig. 4. Thereby, printing can be carried out.<br>
As described above, the second sliding member 115 is<br>
moved along with the first sliding member 104 to engage with<br>
the ink ribbon cassette 108 and therefore, by constituting<br>
the second sliding member 115 by a material having a high strength<br>
of a meta.l or the like, the ink ribbon cassette 108 can firmly<br>
be held by the second sliding member 115 . Therefore, in mounting<br>
the ink ribbon cassette 108 to the printer main body, when<br>
the detent: is released by pushing up a detent 125 of the ink<br>
ribbon cassette 108 by the rotating shafts 106, 107 provided<br>
at the printer main body as shown by Fig. 3 (b) , the ink ribbon<br>
cassette 108 can be held sufficiently solidly.<br>
Further, the second sliding member 115 finishes to<br>
hold the ink ribbon cassette 108 at a former half of a stroke<br>
thereof, thereafter, mechanical contact thereof with the first<br>
sliding .member 104 is cut and therefore, the second sliding<br>
member 115 does not press the printing head 103 for holding<br>
the ink ribbon cassette 108, the printing head 103 is pressed<br>
to the platen roller 102 by a constant pressure and therefore,<br>
an adver,se influence is not effected on printing quality.<br>
Further, the above-described movement of the first<br>
sliding member 104 and the second sliding member 115 is carried<br>
out similarly in interchanging not only the ink ribbon cassette<br>
108 but also expendable items of a printing tube, a tape and<br>
the like.<br>
Further, positions of the engaging portion of the ink<br>
ribbon cassette and the second sliding member engaged with<br>
the engaging portion are not limited to the above-described<br>
example.<br>
Successively, an explanation will be given with regard<br>
to a constitution of a thermal transfer printer according to<br>
the invention, particularly of an ink ribbon winding core and<br>
an ink ribbon cassette in reference to Fig. 8(a) through Fig.<br>
14 .<br>
Fig. 8(a) and 8(b) are perspective views of an ink<br>
ribbon cassette, Fig. 9 is a bottom view of a state of removing<br>
a bottom wall and Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) are respectively a<br>
perspective view and a sectional of a core. In the<br>
above-mentioned drawings, notation A designates an ink ribbon<br>
cassette for thermal transcription. According to the ink ribbon<br>
cassette A, the core 202 wound with an ink ribbon 201 for thermal<br>
transcription and the core 203 for reeling the ink ribbon 201<br>
are contained in the cassette main body 204, the core 202 and<br>
the reeling core 203 comprise a synthetic resin, flanges b<br>
are provided at two upper and lower ends of a center cylindrical<br>
portion a, a center hole 206 is formed at inside of the cylindrical<br>
portion a, a recess portion 205 is formed at an upper end of<br>
the cylindrical portion a and the recess portion 205 is formed<br>
with a plurality of clutch portions 207 each in a shape of<br>
a proj ect ed pieces radially from the center hole 206 . Further,<br>
an inner face of the cylindrical portion a is formed with a<br>
projected portion 208 in a longitudinal direction thereof.<br>
F'igs, 10 (a) andlO(b) illustrate the corebyparticularly<br>
taking an example of the case of the reeling core 203. An<br>
outer face of the cylindrical portion a of the reeling core<br>
203 is provided with a small diameter portion 261 to form a<br>
stepped difference. There is a case in which the ink ribbon<br>
201 as printed by a printing head (not illustrated) is warped<br>
by an influence of a portion which is printed and at which<br>
ink is consumed. Therefore, when the ink ribbon 201 is reeled<br>
around the reeling core 203, there is a case in which an outer<br>
edge port ion in a length direction of the ink ribbon is difficult<br>
to be reeled smoothly. However, by providing the small diameter<br>
portion 761, the ink ribbon 201 as fed from the core 206 and<br>
printed by the printing head can smoothly be reeled to a final<br>
portion thereof.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown by Fig. 9, Fig. 13 and Fig. 14,<br>
it is not: necessary to provide the small diameter portion 261<br>
of the cylindrical portion a and the flange b at the core 202<br>
and the :i nk ribbon 201 may directly be reeled by the smooth<br>
cylindrical portion a. By not providing the small diameter<br>
portion 261 of the cylindrical portion a and the flange portion<br>
b, the core 202 and the reeling core 203 can be arranged to<br>
be further proximate to each other at inside of the cassette<br>
main body 204 to downsize the cassette main body.<br>
Further, arrangement of the core 202 and the reeling<br>
core 203 is s not particularly limited and an arrangement reverse<br>
to that .shown in Fig. 9 may be constituted.<br>
As shown by Fig. 10 (a) and Fig. 10 (b), the clutch portion<br>
207 of each of the core 202 and the reeling core 203 is provided<br>
with a taper face inclined to a vertical direction of the recess<br>
portion 205. As shown by Fig. 10(a), the taper face of the<br>
clutch portion 207 is formed by making a thickness of a front<br>
end portion thereof corresponding to a core upper end side<br>
thinner than that of a base end portion thereof on a side of<br>
the recess portion 205 and making a thickness of a portion<br>
on a core center side thinner than a thickness of a portion<br>
on a core outer peripheral side. Further, according to the<br>
clutch portion 207, in two side faces to be engaged with an<br>
engaging claw, mentioned later, only one side face (first side<br>
face 207a) is constituted by the taper face and other side<br>
face (second side face 207b) is constituted by a face<br>
substantially orthogonal to the recess portion 205.<br>
The cassette main body 204 is constituted in a shape<br>
of a case by the upper wall 209, a bottom 210 and a side wall<br>
211, provided with a containing portion 212 for rotatably<br>
containing the core 202 and the reeling core 203 of the ink<br>
ribbon 201 at inside thereof and provided with a pair of small<br>
ribbon pulleys 213 for exposing the ink ribbon 201 in the midst<br>
of reeling the ink ribbon 201 drawn out from the core 202 to<br>
the reeling core 203. The containing portion 212 is formed<br>
on an inner side of a projected edge 214 in a shape of a circular<br>
arc for positioning the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling<br>
core 203 on the bottom wall 210. A space is formed on inner<br>
sides of the small ribbon pulleys 213 and the printing head<br>
(not illustrated) of the thermal transfer printer is constituted<br>
to dispose in the space.<br>
Further, notches may be formed at side walls of two<br>
upper and lower end portions of Fig. 8 (a) as in the engagement<br>
receiving portions 112, 113 of the ink ribbon cassette 108<br>
shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, a through hole may be formed at<br>
the bottom wall 210 of the cassette main body 204 as in the<br>
through hole 1.14 of the ink ribbon cassette 108 shown in Fig.<br>
2 . By forming the engagement receiving portions and the through<br>
hole in this way to integrate to the above-described ink ribbon<br>
cassette holding mechanism, the ink ribbon cassette mounted<br>
to the thermal transfer printer can firmly be held.<br>
The two flaps 215 are formed at the upper wall 209<br>
of the cassette main body 204 at positions in correspondence<br>
with the core 202 and the reeling core 203. That is, by forming<br>
two long and short flat portions 217 and 218 substantially<br>
in a U-l j .Re shape at the upper wall 209 opposedly to each other,<br>
the flaps 215 are formed on inner sides of the cut portions<br>
217, 218 and connecting portions 219 in an L-like shape are<br>
formed between the two cut portions 217, 218. As shown by<br>
Fig. 11, the short shaft portions 220 are formed at portions<br>
of ends on one side of the flaps 215 in correspondence with<br>
respective centers of the core 202 and the reeling core 203,<br>
and the engaging claws 221 in a projected shape are formed<br>
at portions on further front ends of the short shaft portion<br>
220 in correspondence with the respective clutch portions 207<br>
of the core 202 and the reeling core 203. Further, pressing<br>
portions 222 which can be pressed from outside are formed at<br>
end portions thereof on sides opposed to the flaps 215. When<br>
the pressing portion 222 is pressed, the flap 215 is pivoted<br>
in an up arid down direction in a seesaw-like shape centering<br>
on the connecting portion 219.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, the<br>
short shaft portions 220 of the flaps 215 of the cassette main<br>
body 204 are inserted into upper portions of the center holes<br>
206 of the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203 at<br>
inside of the cassette main body 204 and therefore, as shown<br>
by Fig. 1 1 , the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203<br>
are made to be rotatable centering on the short shaft portions<br>
220. Further, the engaging claws 221 of the flaps 215 are<br>
engaged with the clutch portions 207 in the radial shape at<br>
surroundings of upper ends of the center holes 206 of the ink<br>
ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203 and therefore, both<br>
of the core 202 and the reeling core 203 are brought into a<br>
locked state and cannot be rotated. Therefore, when the ink<br>
ribbon cassette is not charged to the thermal transfer printer,<br>
the cores are not rotated spontaneously. When the ink ribbon<br>
1 is slackened, as shown by Fig. 12, after pivoting the flap<br>
115 by pressing the pressing portion 222 of the flap 215 and<br>
disengaging engagement between the engaging claw 221 and the<br>
clutch portion 207 of the ink ribbon core 202 or the reeling<br>
core 203, the core 202 or the reeling core 203 exposed to a<br>
through hole 216 (refer to Fig. 8) of the bottom wall 210 may<br>
be turned by the finger, a rod or the like.<br>
Further, the flap may not be formed integrally with<br>
the upper wa.11 of the cassette but may formed separately from<br>
the upper wall of the cassette.<br>
As shown by Fig. 12, when the ink ribbon cassette having<br>
the above-described constitution is charged to the thermal<br>
transfer printer, a rotating shaft 226 provided at the thermal<br>
transfer printer may be inserted into the through hole 216<br>
formed at the bottom wall 210 of the cassette main body 204.<br>
Further, when the ink ribbon cassette is inserted to fix to<br>
a predetermined position of the thermal transfer printer by<br>
means, not illustrated, an upper end of the rotating shaft<br>
226 pushes up the short shaft portion 220 of the flap 215 and<br>
therefore, the flap 215 is pivoted, the engaging claw 221 is<br>
floated up, the engagement with the clutch portion 207 is<br>
disengaged and the locked state is released... Projected portions<br>
223 are formed at an outer face-of the rotating shaft 226 along<br>
a longitudinal direction thereof. When the rotating shafts<br>
226 are jnserted from the through holes 216 of the ink ribbon<br>
cassette A into the respective center holes 206 of the ink<br>
ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203, the projected portions<br>
223 of the rotating shaft 226 and the projected portions 208<br>
of the center holes 206 are engaged with each other and therefore,<br>
when the rotating shafts 226 are rotated, the ink ribbon core<br>
202 and the reeling core 203 are also rotated.<br>
further, as described above, according to the embodiment,<br>
at the clutch portion 207, in the side faces engaged with the<br>
engaging claw 221, only the first side face 207a is constituted<br>
by the taper face and the second side face 207b is constituted<br>
by the face substantially orthogonal to the recess portion<br>
205. Therefore, a resistance against rotation in the locked<br>
states of the core 202 and the reeling core 203 can be changed<br>
in accordance with a direction of rotating the cores. That<br>
is, when the core is rotated in the direction of engaging the<br>
taper face (first side face 207a) of the clutch portion 207<br>
and the engaging claw 221, the core can more easily be rotated<br>
than in the case of rotating the core in a direction of engaging<br>
the side face 207b of the clutch portion 207 and the engaging<br>
claw 221 .<br>
When the ink ribbon is slackened in a state in which<br>
the ink ribbon cassette is not charged to the thermal transfer<br>
printer, the user per se needs to rotate the reeling core 203.<br>
Under such a situation, by adopting the above-described<br>
constitution of the clutch portions, slack of the ink ribbon<br>
201 can easily be resolved by urging the user to rotate the<br>
ink ribbon cassette only in one direction.<br>
Further, as shown by Fig. 8, an inclined face 216a<br>
is provided at an edge of the through hole 216 in correspondence<br>
with the reeling core 203. By the inclined face 216a, when<br>
the reel .ing core 203 is rotated in a state in which the ink<br>
ribbon cassette is not charged to the thermal transfer printer,<br>
a portion of the reeling core 203 exposed from the bottom wall<br>
210 of the cassette main body 204 can smoothly be touched by<br>
the finger of the user. Thereby, when the ink ribbon 201 is<br>
slackened, the reeling core 203 can easily be rotated.<br>
Further, although Fig. 8 shows an example of providing<br>
the inclined face 216a only to the through hole 216 in<br>
correspondence with the reeling core 203, the inclined face<br>
216 may be provided at the through hole 216 in correspondence<br>
with the core 202.<br>
Fig. 13 is the plane view of other ink ribbon cassette.<br>
As in a cassette main body 304 shown in the drawing, at two<br>
side portions of the cassette main body, opening portions 224<br>
may be formed by notching the side wall 211. The opening portions<br>
224 are formed by a size of capable of inserting and detaching<br>
the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203 at inside<br>
thereof. Therefore, the ink ribbon winding cassette comprising<br>
the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203 can freely<br>
be attached and detached. That is, when the ink ribbon winding<br>
core set is attached thereto, the pressing portion 212 of the<br>
flap 215 may strongly be pressed to float up the short shaft<br>
portion 220, the ink ribbon core 202 and the reeling core 203<br>
may be inserted from the opening portion 224 to contain in<br>
the containing portion 212 and the short shaft portion 222<br>
of the flat 215 may be moved down. In contrast thereto, when<br>
the ink ribbon 202 or the reeling core 203 at inside thereof<br>
is detached, similarly, the pressing portion 222 of the flat<br>
215 may strongly be pressed to float up the short shaft portion<br>
220 and the ink ribbon core 202 or the reeling core 203 may<br>
be drawn out from the opening portion.<br>
Fig. 14 is a plane view of still other ribbon cassette.<br>
A cassette main body 404 shown in Fig. 14 is provided with<br>
opening portions 224a, 224b similar to the cassette main body<br>
shown in Fig. 13 and formed with a projected portion 225 on<br>
a bottom wall at a vicinity of the opening portion 224a for<br>
inserting and detaching the core 202 . By providing the projected<br>
portion 225, contact resistance between the core and the bottom<br>
wall of the cassette main body in inserting and detaching the<br>
core can be reduced and the ink ribbon ribbon can further easily<br>
be i n t e r oh an g ed .<br>
The cassette main body 404 shown in Fig. 14 is similar<br>
to the cassette main bodies 204, 304 shown in Fig. 8 through<br>
Fig. 13 except the projected portion 225 and a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted. Further, although Fig.<br>
14 shows an example of providing three pieces of the projected<br>
portions 225 only on the side of the opening portion 224a,<br>
a shape, arrangement and a number of pieces of the projected<br>
portions are not: particularly limited. Further, the projected<br>
portions may be provided at a bottom wall of the opening portion<br>
224a on the side of the reeling core 203.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described<br>
embodiments but can variously be modified within the technical<br>
range of the invention and the invention naturally covers the<br>
mo d i fi c a t i on s.<br>
The application is based on Japanese Patent Application<br>
(Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-054824) filed on February<br>
28, 2002 arid Japanese Patent Application (Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2002-054825) filed on February 28, 2002 and<br>
contents thereof are incorporated here by reference.<br>
I n du s tr i a 1_ Applicability:<br>
As described above, according to the ink ribbon winding<br>
core and the ink ribbon cassette of the invention, since the<br>
ink ribbon 201 is charged to the cassette main body 204, in<br>
charging t.o the thermal transfer printer, the ink ribbon cassette<br>
may be charged thereto by inserting the rotating shaft 226<br>
provided at: the thermal transfer printer into the through hole<br>
216 formed at the bottom wall 210 of the cassette main body<br>
204 . Therefore, the ink ribbon 201 is easy to handle and also<br>
charging performance thereof is excellent.<br>
Further, when the flap is formed integrally with the<br>
upper wa .1.1 of. the cassette, slack in reeling the ink ribbon<br>
when the ink ribbon cassette is not charged thereto can be<br>
eliminated by a minimum number of parts.<br>
Further, when the opening portion is formed at the side<br>
portion of the cassette main body 204, only the ink ribbon<br>
201 reeled by the core 202 can be interchanged and therefore,<br>
the invention can be adopted as the core reeling charging system.<br>
Thereby, the cassette is simple to handle, the unit price<br>
is inexpensive, abandoned portions are few, the load on the<br>
environment is reduced and the invention can also deal with<br>
the cassette system and the core reeling system.<br>
Further, according to the ink ribbon cassette holding<br>
mechanism of the thermal transfer printer of the invention,<br>
the second sliding member is moved along with the first sliding<br>
member to be engaged with the ink ribbon cassette. Thereby,<br>
the ink ribbon cassette mounted to the thermal transfer printer<br>
can firmly be held by the second sliding member.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
