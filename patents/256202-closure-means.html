Substituted Benzoxazinones and Uses Thereof<br>
This invention relates to substituted benzoxazinone compounds, and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT2-selective and 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, mood disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and obesity, panic attacks, akathisia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B.L. Roth et al., /. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 1994,268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Mol Pharmacol, 1993, 43, 320-327, A J. Sleight et al., Neurotransmission, 1995,11,1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-8.<br>
While many 5-hydroxytryptamine modulators have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating 5-HT2, 5-HT6 and other 5-<br>
HT receptors.<br>

The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited toy filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br><br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature<br>
range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about<br>
125 °C&gt; and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature,<br>

Scheme A below illustrates the synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of Formula I wherein each A.independently is halo or other leaving group (such as triflate) and maybe the same or different in each occurrence, and R1, R2&gt; R3&gt; R4, R&gt;, R°, R7, R\ R*, R , Ra, RD, n, p, q, r and t are as defined herein.<br>
i<br><br>
SCHEME A<br>
In Step 1 of Scheme A, an ortho nitrophenol a is reduced to the corresponding aniline or aminophenol b. This reduction may be carried out under relatively mild, aqueous conditions, using sodium dithionite or like mild reducing agent.<br>
A cyclization is then carried out in Step 2 to provide the benzoxazinone compound d from the aminophenol b generated in Step 1. Where n is 1, for example, the benzoxazinone d is a 2H-l,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one&gt; and where n is 2 the compound d is a 2,3-dihydro-l,5-benzoxazepin-4(5H)-one. The cyclization may be achieved by reaction of the aminophenol b with a 2-halo acid halide c such as chloroacetyl chloride (to provide n= 1 and R3, R4 as hydrogen), 2-chloropropionyl chloride (which provides n = 1, R as methyl and R as hydrogen), 3-chloropropionyl chloride (providing n = 2 and R ,<br><br>
R as hydrogen), 2-chloroisobutyryl chloride (providing n = 1, R3 as isopropyl and R4 as hydrogen), 2~chloro-2-methylpropionyl chloride (providing n = 1 and R3 and R4 as methyl), and so on. Formation of benzoxazinones in this manner can be achieved under relatively mild polar conditions in the presence of a mild base, as described by Combs et al.; J. Med. Chem.; 33; 380-3861990. The cyclization may also be achieved by reacting b with a 2-hydroxyester under Mitsunobu reaction conditions, as described by Van Hes et al in WO 01/14330.<br>
In Step 3, an N-alkylation of the benzoxazinone compound d is carried out by treatment of compound d from Step 2 with a strong base under dry, polar aprotic conditions and reaction with an a-haloalkyl aryl compound e to provide the N-arylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound f. The haloalkyl aryl compound e may comprise, for example, benzyl halide (to provide r = 1 and Ra and R as hydrogen), 3-halo-3-phenylpropane (providing r = 2 and Ra, R as hydrogen), a-methylbenzyl halide (providing r = 1, Ra as hydrogen and R as methyl), or other a-haloalkylphenyl halides according to the desired Ra and R substituent configuration.<br>
The alkylation of Step 3 may also be carried out using a-haloalkyl napthyl compounds, a-haloalkylbiphenyl compounds or other a-haloalkylaryl compounds. In other embodiments Step 3 may be carried out using a-haloalkyl heteroaryl compounds such as a-haloalkylpyridines, a-haloalkylthiophenes, a-haloalkylmethylenedioxyphenyl compounds, a-haloalkylethylenedioxyphenyl compounds, and the like. In the case of a-haloalkyl heteroaryl compounds, suitable protection group strategies maybe employed to avoid unwanted heteroatom alkylation during this step. In certain embodiments, the alkylation of Step 3 maybe replaced by an aryl- or heteroaryl- sulfonylation wherein a suitable arylsulfonyl halide or heteroarylsulfonyl halide is reacted with the ring nitrogen of the benzoxazinone compound d.<br>
An amination reaction is then carried out in Step 4 wherein the N-arylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound e is reacted with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle fin the presence of a palladium catalyst to replace the leaving group A- with a heterocyclyl group and provide the heterocyclyl-N-arylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound Ie. In many embodiments q is 1 such that the heterocycle compound f is a piperazine compound of the formula h:<br><br><br>
and such that the heterocyclyl-N-arylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound of formula Id is of the formula Ie:<br><br>
which is discussed above. Several alkyl-substituted piperazine compounds are commercially available or easily prepared according to known procedures and may be used in this step. The animation of Step 4 may be effected at both the 8- and 6- positions under similar reaction conditions<br>
In instances where R9 is hydrogen, BOC protection or other suitable protection strategies may be used to protect the corresponding ring nitrogen of compound f. Where a BOC protection group is present, deprotection maybe carried out in this step by treatment of the heterocyclyl-N-arylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound Id with mild acid solution.<br>
Many variations on the above procedure may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. In some instances, amination maybe carried out prior to N-alkylation at the 1-position. The number, functionality and/or location of the R1 substituent groups maybe selected to activate particular positions (i.e., any of positions 5 through 8) of the benzoxazinone ring and thus facilitate amination at selected positions as desired for specific embodiments of the subject compounds.<br>

In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension: In the case of a spray, this maybe achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a<br><br>
form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatine or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules.* Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of the present invention are described in Examples 6-12.<br>
