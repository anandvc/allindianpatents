RETROSPECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIM CAPABILITIES IN A SECURITY MODULE<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for subsequently implementing a SIM<br>
functionality, with the help of which a mobile telephone is enabled to use a mobile<br>
radio network, in a security module.<br>
[0002] Mobile phones usually are provided with a telecommunication card, which is<br>
formed as a chip card inserted in the mobile telephone. Such a chip card has the format<br>
ID-1 or ID-000 according to the international standard ISO 7810. Here a combination<br>
of the stated formats is often used, namely by integrating a card body of the ID-000<br>
format as a break-off part into a card body of the ID-1 format and the chip being<br>
disposed in the area of the ID-000 card body.<br>
[0003] The telecommunication card in particular serves for furnishing proof towards<br>
a mobile telephone service provider of an access authorization to the mobile radio<br>
network and is also referred to as subscriber identity module, abbreviated SIM. A<br>
definite subscriber identity is stored in the telecommunication card which is also<br>
referred to as international mobile subscriber identity, abbreviated IMSI. The<br>
subscriber identity is written into the telecommunication card within the framework of<br>
a personalization, which is carried out in a secure surrounding, before the<br>
telecommunication card is handed out to the user.<br>
[0004] Based on the subscriber identity the mobile radio system can carry out an<br>
authentication and ascertain thereby, whether the mobile telephone is authorized to use<br>
the mobile radio system. In addition, the subscriber identity is necessary for allocating<br>
to the user of the mobile telephone, for example, the call charges charged for a<br>
telephone call.<br>
[0005] Furthermore, the telecommunication card is provided with a number of<br>
further functions. These functions permit, for example, the storage of short messages,<br>
the storage of the latest dialed telephone number for a last number redial, the storage<br>
of telephone numbers in a personal telephone directory or the storage of abbreviated<br><br>
2<br>
numbers with which the dialing operation is facilitated for frequently used telephone<br>
numbers etc.<br>
[0006] From EP 0 920 684 B1 a method for the read-out and read-in of data is<br>
known which are stored on a chip card that has a microprocessor, a memory and an<br>
additional memory. The additional memory can be read out and written into in a<br>
manner which bypasses the operating system.<br>
[0007] EP 0 981 803 Bl discloses a method for performing an electronic<br>
personalization and/or initialization of a chip card. The personalization and/or<br>
initialization is effected with the help of a first apparatus which contacts the chip card<br>
and a second apparatus which is in a data link with the chip card via the first<br>
apparatus.<br>
[0008] US 5,557,679 discloses a method for personalizing a SIM card. The card is<br>
introduced in a card reader, which via a communication network is connected with a<br>
central computer. The IMSI and an authentication key are transmitted in encrypted<br>
form from the central computer to the card reader. The card reader decrypts the<br>
received data and passes them on to the card in a manner which prevents a spy-out.<br>
This can be achieved, for example, by a double encryption of the data and performing<br>
a decryption within the card.<br>
[0009] The invention is based on the problem to permit a use of a mobile telephone<br>
as flexible and comfortable as possible.<br>
[0010] This problem is solved by a method having the feature combination of claim 1.<br>
[0011] With the method according to the invention a SIM functionality, with the<br>
help of which a mobile telephone is enabled to use a mobile radio network, is<br>
subsequently implemented in a security module. For this purpose the SIM<br>
functionality is realized in the form of an application, at least a first part of which is<br>
loaded into the security module. Furthermore, personalizing data required for a use of<br>
the mobile radio network by the mobile telephone, are transmitted from a provider to<br>
the security module in encrypted form on the direct or indirect way. The encrypted<br>
personalizing data are decrypted by the security module with the help of a secret key<br><br>
3<br>
of a user stored in the security module. With the help of the decrypted personalizing<br>
data the security module is personalized.<br>
[0012] The method according to the invention offers a high flexibility, since the<br>
SIM functionality can be subsequently implemented in any desired security module, as<br>
long as such security module meets certain minimum requirements in view of security<br>
and the resources required. Subsequently within the terms of the invention means that<br>
the SIM functionality is not implemented in the security module already within the<br>
framework of manufacturing or an initialization or personalization following the<br>
manufacturing. The implementation of the SIM functionality is not effected until a<br>
later point of time, at which the security module has already been delivered to a dealer<br>
or has been handed out to the user.<br>
[0013] A further advantage of the method according to the invention is that the<br>
implementation can be carried out at any time and the user is largely independent with<br>
respect to the provider he chooses. The effort for the implementation is small and the<br>
requirements of a high security standard are still met.<br>
[0014] Preferably, the first part of the application comprises security-relevant<br>
operations. With that a high security standard is achieved, because the security module<br>
is protected against manipulations. A second part of the application can be loaded into<br>
the mobile telephone. Thereby, the normally very limited resources of the security<br>
module can be saved. But it is also possible to completely load the application into the<br>
security module.<br>
[0015] The encrypted personalizing data can be transmitted upon a respective<br>
inquiry which the user directs to the provider. Here it is advantageous, when the<br>
inquiry contains the public key of the user and/or a user identification, which in<br>
particular is encrypted with a public key of the provider. With that the provider is in<br>
the position to encrypt security-relevant data in such a way that they can be decrypted<br>
only by the user. The inquiry can contain a further identification, on the basis of which<br>
a service contingent is allocated to the user.<br><br>
4<br>
[0016] The secret key of the user can already be stored in the security module on<br>
handing out the security module to the user. This has the advantage that measures, by<br>
which a key is generated or transmitted to the security module at a later point of time,<br>
are not required. Likewise, it is also possible, that the secret key of the user is<br>
generated and stored in the security module after the handing out of the security<br>
module to the user. With that the risk of a spy-out of the key is reduced. The secret key<br>
of the user in particular can be generated by the security module. In this way a very<br>
high security standard can be achieved, because the secret key at no time leaves the<br>
security module. It is especially advantageous, when the secret key of the user is<br>
generated together with the public key of the user as a key pair. It is possible to<br>
generate such key pairs with a comparatively low effort.<br>
[0017] The data transmission between the security module and the provider can be<br>
effected via an air interface of the mobile telephone or an online connection set up via<br>
any other device. Here the use of the air interface has the advantage, that an additional<br>
device is not necessary.<br>
[0018] As a security module preferably a data carrier different from a chip card of<br>
the format ID-1 or ID-000 of the standard ISO 7810 is used. These formats correspond<br>
to the telecommunication cards usually used in mobile phones, which are also referred<br>
to as SIM cards. Therefore, the invention primarily relates to a form of the security<br>
module that deviates from that what is usual with mobile phones. In particular, a<br>
trusted platform module or a secure multimedia card is used as a security module.<br>
[0019] In the following the invention is explained in detail with reference to the<br>
embodiments represented in the Figure.<br>
[0020] Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a first variant of the method<br>
according to the invention and<br>
[0021] Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of a second variant of the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
[0022] Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a first variant of the method<br>
according to the invention. There are displayed a mobile telephone 1 and a provider 2<br><br>
5<br>
that offers access to a mobile radio network. The mobile telephone 1 has a secure<br>
multimedia card (SMMC) 3, which is inserted in the mobile telephone 1. The<br>
construction of the mobile telephone 1 itself is known and not shown in more detail in<br>
Fig.l.<br>
[0023] The secure multimedia card 3 represents a compact electronic storage<br>
medium, which is formed in a card-shaped manner. A part of the storage capacity of<br>
the secure multimedia card 3 is realized in the form of a memory 4 safe from access.<br>
In the memory 4 are stored a public key and a secret key. The public key is<br>
abbreviated with PK. The secret key is abbreviated with SK. The public key PK and<br>
the secret key SK, for example, are generated as a key pair and stored in memory 4 of<br>
the secure multimedia card 3 before the handing out of the secure multimedia card 3 to<br>
a user. Likewise, it is also possible to generate such a key pair and to store it in<br>
memory 4 of the secure multimedia card 3 after the handing out of the secure<br>
multimedia card 3. In addition to the pure storage function the secure multimedia card<br>
3 is able to execute algorithms safe from manipulations. With that it is possible, for<br>
example, that the key pair is generated by the secure multimedia card 3 itself.<br>
[0024] In addition to the shown secure multimedia card 3 the mobile telephone 1<br>
can have a not figuratively shown telecommunication card, which is also referred to as<br>
subscriber identity module, abbreviated SIM. Such a telecommunication card is<br>
formed as a chip card of the format ID-1 or ID-000 predetermined by the international<br>
standard ISO 7810. The telecommunication card serves for proving an access<br>
authorization to a mobile radio network and to thereby provide the mobile telephone 1<br>
with an access to the mobile radio network. For this purpose in the telecommunication<br>
card is stored a definite user identification, which is referred to as international mobile<br>
subscriber identity, abbreviated IMSI. The mobile telephone 1 can also be operated<br>
without the telecommunication card, because within the scope of the invention the<br>
functionality of the telecommunication card is assumed by the secure multimedia card<br>
3. In the following the functionality of the telecommunication card is referred to as<br>
SIM functionality. For providing secure multimedia card 3 with the SIM functionality,<br>
the process is as follows:<br><br>
6<br>
[0025] At first in a transmission step S1 the SIM functionality is transmitted from<br>
provider 2 to secure multimedia card 3 in the form of an application, i.e. a software<br>
which emulates the mode of functioning of the telecommunication card, and the<br>
transmitted application is loaded into the secure multimedia card 3. The transmission<br>
of the application for example can be effected with the help of an online connection<br>
between a server of the provider 2 and a personal computer of the user. Likewise, the<br>
transmission can also be effected from the provider 2 to a dealer who then loads the<br>
application into the secure multimedia card 3 of the user. Furthermore, it is possible<br>
that the application is transmitted from provider 2 to mobile telephone 1, in which is<br>
located the secure multimedia card 3. For transmitting the application security<br>
measures are not required, because it does not contain any secret data.<br>
[0026] Subsequent to transmission step S1 a transmission step S2 is executed, in<br>
which the public key PK stored in the memory 4 of the secure multimedia card 3 and<br>
an identification number ID are transmitted from the secure multimedia card 3 to the<br>
provider 2. For the transmission the same transmission paths as for transmission step<br>
S1 are available. The identification number ID can also be stored in the memory 4 of<br>
the secure multimedia card 3 and preferably is transmitted in encrypted form. The<br>
encryption in particular is carried out by the secure multimedia card 3, wherein as a<br>
key a public key of provider 2 can be used. In a development of the method according<br>
to the invention in addition to the identification number ID a further number is<br>
transmitted to provider 2. This further number for example represents a certain number<br>
of short messages (SMS), which the user can send free of charge. The further number<br>
can be handed over to the user for example by means of a scratch card as an<br>
advertising gift.<br>
[0027] As a reaction to transmission step S2 in a transmission step S3 the provider 2<br>
transmits personalizing data to the secure multimedia card 3, which are encrypted with<br>
the public key PK of the user sent in transmission step S2. The personalizing data in<br>
particular contain an IMSI. For the transmission step S3, too, the already mentioned<br>
transmission paths are available. The execution of the transmission step S3 can be<br>
made conditional on that the provider 2 has received a corresponding request from the<br>
user.<br><br>
7<br>
[0028] The secure multimedia card 3 decrypts the received personalizing data and<br>
autonomously carries out a personalization. After the personalization has been<br>
properly carried out the secure multimedia card 3 can be used like a<br>
telecommunication card, i.e. it is provided with the already mentioned SIM<br>
functionality. For example, with mobile telephone 1 telephone calls can be made,<br>
without a telecommunication card being additionally required therefor. When the SIM<br>
functionality of the secure multimedia card 3 is used, the application loaded in<br>
transmission step S1 is executed by the secure multimedia card 3 itself, which herefor<br>
can access the data stored within the framework of the personalization. Alternatively,<br>
it is also possible, that the secure multimedia card 3 executes only security-relevant<br>
parts of the application and the rest of the application is executed by the mobile<br>
telephone 1. But herefor it is required that the implementation of the SIM functionality-<br>
is carried out in a modified form. This is explained with reference to Fig. 2 in more<br>
detail.<br>
[0029] In order to protect the application transmitted in transmission step S1 against<br>
being used by unauthorized third parties, it can be transmitted in a fashion encrypted<br>
with the public key PK of the user. In this case the transmission is effected not until<br>
after the receipt of this public key PK on the part of the provider 2.<br>
[0030] Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of a second variant of the method<br>
according to the invention. In the second variant the implementation of the SIM<br>
functionality is carried out in such a way that later, when the SIM functionality is used,<br>
the application is executed partly by mobile telephone 1 and partly by secure<br>
multimedia card 3. For the execution of the application the mobile telephone 1 has an<br>
application processor 5, which also executes other applications of the mobile<br>
telephone 1 and therefore is also provided in mobile telephone 1 according to Fig. 1.<br>
But therein the application processor 5 of the mobile telephone 1 is not important for<br>
the invention and thus not displayed. Between application processor 5 and secure<br>
multimedia card 3 there is a data link.<br>
[0031] In the second variant of the method according to the invention in a<br>
transmission step S4 the apnlication, which comprises the SIM functionality, is<br><br>
8<br>
transmitted from provider 2 to the application processor 5 of the mobile telephone 1.<br>
In application processor 5 those parts of the application are stored, which later are<br>
executed by application processor 5. The other parts of the application, which are to be<br>
executed by the secure multimedia card 3, are passed on to secure multimedia card 3<br>
by application processor 5 and stored there. For example, in the secure multimedia<br>
card 3 a GSM algorithm is stored, with the help of which the mobile telephone 1 logs<br>
itself on to the mobile radio network. GSM here stands for global system for mobile<br>
communications.<br>
[0032] Following the transmission step S4 a transmission step S5 is carried out, in<br>
which the public key PK and the identification number ID of the user are transmitted<br>
from the application processor 5 of the mobile telephone 1 to the provider 2. For this<br>
purpose these data are provided in a fashion already described with the first method<br>
variant. Thereafter a transmission step S6 is carried out, in which provider 2 transmits<br>
the personalizing data encrypted with the public key of the user to the application<br>
processor 5. Application processor 5 passes on the encrypted personalizing data to the<br>
secure multimedia card 3, which the secure multimedia card 3 decrypts and uses for<br>
carrying out a personalization.<br>
[0033] The transmission paths of the second method variant can be formed like in<br>
the first method variant, here, optionally, the application processor 5 additionally<br>
having to be taken into consideration. As for the rest, the explanations for the first<br>
method variant analogously apply to the second method variant, if nothing different is<br>
described.<br>
[0034] With the implementation of the SIM functionality according to the second<br>
method variant, too, the secure multimedia card 3 then can be used for enabling the<br>
mobile telephone 1 to access the mobile radio network. But, however, the secure<br>
multimedia card 3 does not provide the entire SIM functionality, but only its security-<br>
relevant parts. As for the rest, the SIM functionality is realized in the application<br>
processor 5 of the mobile telephone 1.<br>
[0035] The above explanations equally apply to the UMTS field. UMTS stands for<br>
universal mobile telecommunication system and refers to a special communication<br><br>
9<br>
standard. Instead of the SIM then a USIM (universal subscriber identity module) is<br>
used.<br>
[0036] The method according to the invention can also be used for data carriers<br>
different from a secure multimedia card 3. For example, other memory cards for<br>
electronic devices are possible, if they ensure a sufficient security and are able to<br>
execute an application. In particular, a trusted platform module is also suitable, whose<br>
primary task it is to prove the authenticity of an electronic device and which is<br>
available in different realization forms.<br><br>
