METHOD FOR PRODUCING COATED CARBON PARTICLES AND USE OF THE LATTER IN ANODE MATERIALS FOR LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing coated carbon particles, the coated carbon particles and their use for producing anode material for lithium ion batteries.<br>
Lithium ion batteries are industrially very important energy storing systems since they have the highest energy density of up to 180 Wh/kg among known chemical and electrochemical energy stores which can be used in practice. Lithium ion batteries are employed especially in the field of portable electronics, for example laptops or mobile telephones. The use of lithium ion batteries in the field of transport means, for example bicycles or automobiles, is also being discussed.<br>
The negative electrode material (anode) used is mostly graphitic carbon. Graphitic carbon has stable cycling properties and a quite high degree of handling safety compared to lithium metal which is used in "lithium batteries". An important argument for the use of graphitic carbon in negative electrode materials is the small volume changes of the host material associated with the intercalation and release of lithium, i.e. the electrode remains approximately stable. Thus, a volume increase of about 10% is measured for the intercalation of lithium in graphitic carbon in the case of the limiting stoichiometry of LiC6- However, a disadvantage of graphitic carbon is its relatively low electrochemical capacity of, theoretically, 372 mAh/g of graphite, which corresponds to only about a tenth of the electrochemical capacity which can be achieved theoretically using lithium metal of 3862 mAh/g of lithium.<br>
For this reason, alternative materials have long been sought, especially among alloys, for example binary alloys based on aluminum (Lindsay et al. in J. Power Sources 119 (2003), 84), tin (Winter et al. in Electrochim. Acta 45 (1999), 31; Tirado in Mater. Sci. Eng. R-Rep. 40 (2003), 103) or antimony (Tirado in Mater. Sci. Eng. R-Rep. 40 (2003), 103), ternary alloys based on copper-tin (Kepler et al. in Electrochem Solid-State Lett 2 (1999), 307) or copper-antimony (Yang et al. in Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 2 (1999), 161) or metal oxides based on tin oxide (Huggins in Solid State Ion. 152 (2002), 61). These materials have high theoretical specific capacities of, for example, 994 mAh/g in the case of tin. If these high<br><br><br>
Compared to metallic lithium, anode materials based on alloys have the advantage that dendrite formation does not occur during lithium deposition. In contrast to graphite materials, anode materials based on alloys are suitable for use together with electrolytes based on propylene carbonate. This makes it possible to use lithium ion batteries at low temperatures. However, a disadvantage of these alloys is the large volume expansion during cycling, i.e. during intercalation and release of lithium, which is above 200% and sometimes even up to 300% (Besenhard et al. in J. Power Sources 68 (1997), 87).<br>
Silicon has likewise been examined because, like tin, it forms binary compounds with lithium which are electrochemically active (Weydanz et al. in Journal of Power Sources 82 (1999), 237; Seefurth et al. in J. Electrochem. Soc. 124 (1977), 1207; Lai in J. Electrochem. Soc. 123 (1976), 1196). These binary compounds of lithium and silicon have a very high lithium content. The theoretical maximum lithium content corresponds to Li4Si which has a very high theoretical specific capacity of about 4400 mAh/g of silicon (Lupu et al. in Inorg. Chem. 42 (2003), 3765). These binary compounds are formed at a similarly low potential as the intercalation compounds of lithium in graphite of 
Various techniques have been used for improving the adhesion of silicon to the support material, for example intensive milling for a number of hours (Dimov et al. in Electrochim. Acta 48 (2003), 1579; Niu et al. in Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 5 (2002), A107), carbon coating from the gas phase (Wilson et al. in J. Electrochem. Soc. 142 (1995), 326), and pyrolysis of an intimate mixture of the respective precursors (Larcher et al. in Solid State Ion.<br><br><br>
Experiments using nanosize materials, i.e. materials having a particle size of about 100 nm, are described by Graetz et al. in Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 6 (2003), A194; Li et al. in Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 2 (1999), 547, Yang et al. in Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 6 (2003), A154 and Gao et al. in Adv. Mater. 13 (2001), 816. Graetz et al. describe the preparation of nanosize silicon films which display a reversible capacity of more than 2300 mAh/g (in the case of a film deposited by means of chemical vapor deposition) or 1100 mAh/g (in the case of the film which builds up on particles), but fading is relatively high. Li et al. utilize a mixture of nanosize silicon and carbon black which likewise displays a very high initial capacity of over 2000 mAh/g, but this drops significantly during cycling and less than 25 cycles are shown. Yang et al. utilize the pyrolysis of a starting mixture comprising nanosize silicon for producing their active materials and obtain reversible capacities of over 700 mAh/g during 30 cycles, but fading could not be avoided in this case either. Gao et al. describe the electrochemical reaction of silicon obtained by laser ablation with lithium, but obtain an initial reversible capacity of about 700 mAh/g.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an anode material for lithium ion batteries which displays increased mechanical stability during cycling and a high specific capacity.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that anode material comprising electrically conductive carbon particles coated with elemental silicon has a higher mechanical stability during cycling than silicon-containing anode material according to the prior art. The anode material of the invention displays a lower irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle. Furthermore, the anode material of the invention displays lower fading, as a result of which the cycle time is increased. This makes it possible to exploit the advantages of silicon, namely its very high specific capacity, without the degradation caused by mechanical destruction due to volume expansion which is usually observed. The use of the coated carbon particles of the invention enables the capacity of lithium ion batteries to be significantly increased. This makes it<br><br><br><br>
electricity. A further advantage is the opportunity of making the cells of the lithium ion battery smaller at a constant capacity, so as to obtain smaller electric appliances. This opens up fields of application which have hitherto not been possible for lithium ion batteries because of the size of the corresponding cells.<br>
The invention provides a process for producing coated carbon particles, which comprises coating electrically conductive carbon particles with elemental doped or undoped silicon by chemical vapor deposition from at least one gaseous silane in an oxygen-free gas atmosphere in a reaction space, with the electrically conductive carbon particles being in continual motion during the vapor deposition.<br>
The invention further provides coated carbon particles in which an electrically conductive carbon core has been coated with elemental doped or undoped silicon, and also provides for their use for producing anode material for lithium ion batteries.<br>
The invention also provides an anode material for lithium ion batteries which comprises coated carbon particles according to the invention, and also a lithium ion battery which comprises an anode comprising an anode material according to the invention.<br>
In the process of the invention for producing coated carbon particles, electrically conductive carbon particles are coated with elemental doped or undoped silicon by chemical vapor deposition from at least one gaseous silane in an oxygen-free gas atmosphere in a reaction space, with the electrically conductive carbon particles being in continual motion during the vapor deposition.<br>
In the process of the invention, the electrically conductive carbon particles in the reaction space are in continual motion so as to achieve uniform coating of these carbon particles. This can be achieved, for example, by means of the gas stream introduced into the reaction space. Here, the reactor geometry, in particular the arrangement of the inlet for the gas stream, and the volume flow of the gas stream introduced are selected so that movement of the electrically conductive carbon particles results. For example, the process of the invention can be carried<br><br><br>
The carbon particles to be coated can be fed either batchwise or continuously into the reaction space, and the coated carbon particles can be discharged from the reaction space either batchwise or continuously. Thus, the process of the invention can be carried out batchwise or continuously.<br>
The process of the invention is preferably carried out using electrically conductive carbon particles which are amorphous and/or crystalline in the form of graphite, but preference is given to using graphite particles.

It is also possible to use carbon black particles made up of primary particles associated to form aggregates and/or agglomerates as carbon particles in the process of the invention. In this case, the primary particles preferably have a mean particle diameter of from 20 to 60 nm.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, aggregates are made up of spherical or largely spherical primary particles as are initially formed in the reaction for producing the carbon black particles which have grown together to form aggregates in the further course of the reaction. The degree of growth of the aggregates can be influenced by the process parameters in the production of the carbon black particles. These aggregates can form agglomerates in the further course of the reaction. In contrast to the aggregates, which can generally not be broken up into primary particles, or can be broken up only partially into primary particles, the term agglomerates as used for the purposes of the present invention refers to only a loose clumping of aggregates which can easily disintegrate into the aggregates.<br><br><br>

This can be achieved, for example, by means of a plasma, by means of ozonization or by means of a wet chemical process.

In a particular embodiment of the process of the invention, the gas stream used comprises a mixture of a plurality of gaseous silanes. For the purposes of the present invention, the term silanes encompasses silicon-hydrogen compounds and also silicon-chlorine-hydrogen compounds and silicon-chlorine compounds. The gas<br><br><br>

In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a gas stream consisting of a silane, particularly preferably monosilane, and an inert gas, particularly preferably argon, is introduced into the reaction space. In a further embodiment, a gas stream comprising not only the silane and the inert gas but also a gaseous compound of a doping element is used.<br>
The residence time of the gas stream introduced into the reaction space is preferably selected so that virtually quantitative reaction of the silane occurs. The residence time in the process of the invention is therefore preferably from 0.1 to 10 seconds and more preferably from 1 to 5 seconds.<br>

The concentration of the electrolyte salt is preferably from 0.5 mol/1 to the solubility limit of the respective salt, but preferably 1 mol/1. In a particular embodiment of the lithium ion battery of the invention, this comprises an electrolyte comprising at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight, of an ionic liquid. This electrolyte particularly preferably contains from 0.5 to 10% by weight of a film former such as vinylene carbonate. For the purposes of the present invention, the term ionic liquid refers to salts which have a melting point of not more than 100°C.<br>
However, the lithium ion batteries of the invention can also comprise an electrolyte containing from 0.5 to 10% by weight, preferably from 2 to 5% by weight, of vinylene carbonate.<br>
The lithium ion batteries of the invention preferably comprise an electrolyte comprising from 20 to 70% by volume of ethylene carbonate and/or 20 to 70% by volume of dimethyl carbonate, from 0.5 to 2 mol/1 of LiPF6 and an addition of from 0.5 to 5% by weight of vinylene carbonate. The lithium ion battery of the invention particularly preferably comprises<br><br><br>
The cathodes present in the lithium ion batteries of the invention are cathodes according to the prior art.<br>
The following examples illustrate the coated carbon particles according to the invention and their use according to the invention in the anode material, without the invention being restricted to this embodiment.<br>
Example 1 - Production of coated carbon particles according to the invention 20 g of graphite (TIMREX KS6 from Timcal) were placed in a heatable rotary tube furnace. The furnace was heated to a temperature of 700°C. The tubular reaction space containing the initially charged graphite was rotated at a rotational speed of 5 revolutions per minute. A gas stream comprising argon as carrier gas and 10% by volume of monosilane (SiEU) was passed at a flow rate of 50 seem (standard cubic centimeters per minute; 1 seem corresponds to 1 cm3 of gas per minute, based on 0°C and atmospheric pressure) through the reaction space of the rotary tube furnace. After a reaction time of 4 hours, coated carbon particles having a coating of elemental silicon were obtained.<br>
Gravimetric analysis indicated that the coated carbon particles contain 7% by weight of silicon, based on the coated carbon particles. A scanning electron micrograph of a coated carbon particle is shown in fig. 1.<br>
Example 2 - Production of anode material according to the invention<br>
90 g of the coated carbon particles produced in example 1 and 10 g of the binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) were firstly mixed mechanically, subsequently mixed one more time in an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone suspension in which the PVdF is present as a 5% strength solution in N-methyl-2-pyrollidone by means of a high-speed stirrer and subsequently applied in a thickness of preferably 250 μm by means of a doctor blade to a 20 urn thick commercial copper foil which had been pretreated with a primer. The copper foil which has been coated in this way is subsequently dried at 80°C under reduced pressure and subsequently rolled at about 80°C. Circular electrodes were subsequently stamped from this coated copper foil.<br><br><br>
Example 3 - Electrochemical studies<br>
Electrochemical cycling took place in a half-cell arrangement. In the half-cell arrangement, the anode material according to the invention was measured as working electrode in a sandwich arrangement comprising working electrode - separator/electrolyte -counterelectrode/reference electrode, with a lithium disk being used as counterelectrode/reference electrode. As limits to the potential, 100 mV and 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+ were used. The cycling rate is reported together with the current density per unit active mass, which corresponds to the total mass of coated carbon particles, of the anode material.<br>
Charging was carried out with a drop in current on reaching the voltage limit to below a value corresponding to 10 mA/g. The use of this drop in current makes it possible to separate the performance of an electrode (proportion of current which flows in a constant current mode, or galvanostatic proportion) from any irreversible damage (reflected in a reduction in the total capacity, i.e. including the current flowing in the potentiostatic step) (on the subject, see H. Buqa et al. mITE Battery Letters, 4 (2003), 38).<br>
The electrochemical studies were carried out in a classical manner, i.e. using a switch-off mode based exclusively on the upper and lower limits to the potential for the individual half cycles. This is the mode employed in all customary batteries.<br>
The electrochemical studies were carried out using 0.5 ml of an electrolyte composed of<br>
98% by weight of a mixture of 50% by weight of ethylene carbonate and 50% by<br>
weight of dimethyl carbonate containing 1 mol/1 of LiPF6 based on the mixture,<br>
and<br>
2% by weight of vinylene carbonate.<br><br><br>
Fading is, for example, 1.6%o between cycle 11 and cycle 20. For the purposes of the present invention, fading is the decrease in the reversible (utilizable) capacity as the number of cycles increases. The irreversible capacity quickly assumes a value of 0.2-0.3%. The electrochemical capacity is about 2000mAh/g. The cumulated irreversible capacity losses over the first 10 cycles are only 29%. The use of the coated carbon particles of the invention in the anode material makes it possible to improve the cycling properties and the mechanical stability of the anode material after a large number of cycles is improved.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
