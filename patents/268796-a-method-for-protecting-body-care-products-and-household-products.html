				<td>stabilization of body-care and household products against degradation by UV radiation using merocvanine derivatives Stabilization of body-care and household products<br>
The present invention relates to the use of selected light stabilizers for protecting body-care and household products from hemolytic and oxidative degradation.<br>
The product trend of recent years towards increasing! Use of natural substances based on oil and fat in cosmetic formulations and household products also increases the problem of the oxidative degradation of fats and oils, resulting in rancidity. Natural oils or unsaturated fatty acids are hardly ever absent from emulsions. Oxidative changes may sometimes produce reactive metabolites, for example ketones, aldehydes, acids, epoxides and lip peroxides.<br>
As a result there is on the one hand an undesirable change in the smell of the products and on the other hand substances may be obtained which may alter the skin tolerance. The uncontrolled formation of free radicals on the skin contributes primarily to the initiation and progression of a multitude of pathophysical modulations, for example inflammation, canceroge-nesis and the like.<br>
However, oxidative degradation processes are not only found in the case of natural substances based on oil and fat. They are also found in a number of other cosmetic ingredients, such as fragrances and odoriferous substances, vitamins, colourants and the like.<br>
To prevent oxidative degradation processes (photooxidation, autooxidation), so-called antioxidants (AO) are therefore used in cosmetic and food products. These antioxidants may be classified into compounds which prevent oxidation (complex fonners, reducing agents and the like) and into compounds which interrupt the free radical chain reactions, for example butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), gallates, such as propyl-gallate (PG), or t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). However, the latter compounds often do not meet the requirements with respect to pH stability as well as to light and temperature stability.<br>
As a consequence the actives in such containers unadvantageously change their properties due to autoxidative processes. This results for example in a reduction of viscosity and changes in color or smell.<br><br>
Furthermore, the growing product trend in the recent years has also resulted in an increased use of transparent (glass, PET etc.) containers for cosmetic formulations and household products. Although both glass and ordinary plastics have a certain inherent absorption in the UV-B-range the absorption in the UV-A range is very low.<br>
Various stabilization techniques for clear package products by UV absorption are commonly used and well known. For example broad-band UV light stabilizers of the benzotriazole class enhance product stability and shelf live due to their very good UV-A and UV-B absorption properties compared to other absorbers such as benzophenones which mainly absorb UV-B. The most effective today known stabilizers for preventing or delaying light induced fading of transparent packaged products are e.g. benzotriazole derivativess known under the trade names Ciba TINOGARD HS or Ciba TINOGARD TL<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that specific light stabilizers based on merocyanine derivatives perform outstanding UV absorber properties and are therefore suitable for product protection.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the use of merocyanine derivatives of formula<br><br><br><br>

The stabilizer systems of the present invention are also used in household cleaning and treatment agents, for example in laundry products and fabric softeners, liquid cleansing and scouring agents, glass detergents, neutral cleaners (all-purpose cleaners), acid household cleaners (bath), bathroom cleaners, WC cleaners, for instance in washing, rinsing and dishwashing agents, kitchen and oven cleaners, clear rinsing agents, dishwasher detergents, shoe polishes, polishing waxes, floor detergents and polishes, metal, glass and ceramic cleaners, textile-care products, rug cleaners and carpet shampoos, agents for removing rust, color and stains (stain remover salt), furniture and multipurpose polishes and leather and vinyl dressing agents (leather and vinyl sprays) and air fresheners.<br>
Household cleaning agents are aqueous or alcoholic (ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) solutions of one or more of the following components:<br>
anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and/or cationic surfactants<br>
soaps, prepared by saponification of animal and vegetable greases<br>
organic acids, like hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, or sulfuric acid,<br>
for basic products inorganic (NaOH or KOH) or organic bases;<br>
abrasives for improved cleaning of surfaces,<br>
waxes and/or silicones for maintenance and protection of surfaces,<br>
polyphosphates,<br>
substances which eliminate hypochlorite or halogens;<br>
peroxides comprising bleaching activators like TAED, for example sodium perborate or<br>
H2O2;<br><br>
enzymes;<br>
in washing detergents discoloration inhibitors, soil-release compounds, grey scale<br>
inhibitors, foam inhibitors, fluorescent whitening agents;<br>
cleaning agents based on wax may comprise solvents selected from benzine, turpentine<br>
and/or paraffines and emulsifiers based on wax;<br>
filling agents like silicates, polyphosphates, Zeolithes for powdery cleaning agents;<br>
pigments, lakes or soluble dyes;<br>
perfumes; and<br>
light stabilizers, antioxidants and chelating agents.<br>
Colored cleaning agents and decorative cosmetic products can comprise the following dyes: inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide (Iron Oxide Red, Iron Oxide Yellow, Iron Oxide Black, etc.). Ultramarines, Chromium Oxide Green or Carbon Black; natural or synthetic orgnic pigments;<br>
disperse dyes which may be solubilzed in solvents like direct hair dyes of the HC type, for example HC Red No. 3, HC Blue No. 2 and all other hair dyes listed in International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, 7th edition 19997) or the dispersion dyes listed in Color Index International or Society of Dyers and Colourists; color varnishes (insoluble salts of soluble dyes, like many Ca-, Ba- or Al-salts of anionic ,    dyes);<br>
soluble anionic or cationic dyes, like acid dyes (anionic), basic dyes (cationic), direct dyes, reactive dyes or solvent dyes.<br>
Generally, for the coloration of household- and body care products all substances are suitable which have an absorption in the visible light of electromagnetic radiation (wave length of ca. 4000 to 700 nm). The absorption is often caused by the following chromophores:<br>
Azo- (mono-, di, tris-, or poly-)stilbene-, carotenoide-, diarylmethan-, triarylmethan-, xanthen-, acridin-, quinoline, methin- (also polymethin-), thiazol-, indamin-, indophenol-, azin-, oxazin, thiazin-, anthraquinone-, indigoid-, phtalocyanine- and further synthetic, natural and/or inorganic chromophores.<br>
The present invention also relates to home care and fabric care products such as drain cleaners, disinfectant solutions, upholstery cleaners, automotive care products (e.g., to clean<br><br>
and/or polish and protect paint, tires, chrome, vinyl, leather, fabric, rubber, plastic and fabric), degreasers, polishes (glass, wood, leather, plastic, marble, granite, and tile, etc.), and metal polishes and cleaners. Antioxidants are suitable to protect fragrances in above products as well as in dryer sheets. The present invention also relates to home care products such as candles, gel candles, air fresheners and fragrance oils (for the home).<br><br>
The stabilizers of formula (1) according to the present invention are for example incorporated by dissolution in an oil phase or alcoholic or water phase, where required at elevated temperature.<br>
The present body care products and household products have high stability towards color changes and chemical degradation of the ingredients present in these products. For example, present compositions that comprise a dye are found to have excellent color stability.<br>

The following stabilized and unstabilized samples were prepared for antioxidation testing:<br>
1.	pure linoleic acid<br>
2.	linoleic acid containing 0,05 % of compound of formula (104).<br>
The samples were placed in a RACIMAT and heated to 80 °C. An airflow of 15 L/min was adjusted. The airstream bubbles through each heated sample and aftenA/ards through a water reservoir. Thus all volatile organic compounds formed by the oxidation process are carried Into the water resen/oir by the airstream. The conductivity of the water reservoir is monitored online during the measurement. Once oxidation starts volatile organic compounds like formic acid are transported into the water reservoir which results in a rapid (exponential) increase of conductivity. The time until oxidation starts is called "induction time".<br><br><br>
Sample 2 comprising a stabilizer according to the present invention exhibits better oxidation stability compared to the unstabilized sample.<br><br>
