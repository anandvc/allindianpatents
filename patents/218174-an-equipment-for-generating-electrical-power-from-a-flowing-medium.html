				<td>The present invention relates to equipment for generating electrical power from a flowing medium.<br>
The present invention relates to equipment and a method for generating electrical power from a flowing medium, for example water, having a number of turbine generator units of which at least some are arranged one above another and/or beside one another and are connected to one another to form one or more modules. Furthermore, the invention relates to an installation for producing electrical power and a method of rebuilding such an installation.<br>
Equipment of the type mentioned above emerges,  for example, from US 4,804,855 and 4,755,690 (Obermeyer). These describe equipment having a  large  number of turbine generator units arranged one above another and beside one another and connected to form modules, which are arranged on a dam between two piers and can be raised and lowered by means of a crane. The turbine generator units are constructed in the form of so-called tube generators, in which a pear-shaped tube is provided  to  accommodate  the  generator,  at  whose tapering end a turbine is arranged which is connected firmly to the generator so as to rotate with it via a horizontal shaft, which is mounted in the tube. At its front, tapering end, the tube is supported by guide plates on an inlet tube surrounding the generator and the turbine.<br>
As compared with large tubular generators in conventional power stations, the arrangement of a plurality of comparatively substantially smaller turbine generator units beside one another and one above another has the advantage of a considerably shorter structural length and, associated with this, lower investment in the infrastructure sector, but also flexible operation. In the case of a large number of turbine generator units, there is the risk that high<br>
stresses will occur on a module as a result of the superimposition of oscillations of individual units. Furthermore, in the case of a large number of turbine generator units, a comparatively high weight of the module is to be expected, which results in an appropriately strengthened crane and a corresponding infrastructure.<br>
It is an object of the present invention further to improve the equipment already known from the prior art and, in particular, to specify turbine generator units which are simpler in constructional terms, more compact and more beneficial.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that at least one generator of a turbine generator unit is constructed as a synchronous generator, in which permanent magnetic poles are provided for excitation.<br>
Through the invention, a departure is made from the known, tried and tested concept of the electrically excited synchronous generators, and a new type of generator is used which has the advantage of a particularly compact, simple and beneficial structure. When this generator type is used in a module having turbine generator units arranged beside one another and/or one above another, however, the result is additionally the substantial advantage that the weight is reduced further, since the electrical excitation, that is to say the exciter windings with all the required electrical parts, can be omitted. As a result, an infrastructure of smaller dimensions can be used to install such modules, and a small crane can be used for raising and lowering the modules, which has a great effect on the structural costs of an installation. However, the lack of electrical excitation also substantially simplifies the design construction, which acts directly and positively on the required overall<br>
size and on the costs of a turbine generator unit and the cooling.<br>
An installation for generating electrical power with a dam structure, in the context of the present invention, is advantageously configured in such a way that a plurality of turbine generator units are arranged and supported beside one another, the generators of the turbine generator units being constructed as synchronous generators which have permanent magnetic poles for excitation.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is suitable to a particular extent for rebuilding existing installations which are predominantly provided for the at least temporary storage of water, such as sluices, in an installation for generating electrical power. In this case, the structure has at least one releasable element that can be used to store the medium, for example a weir, a module corresponding to the dimensions of the releasable element being produced within the context of the method of the invention, which module has a number of turbine generator units arranged beside one another and/or one above another, with synchronous generators with permanent magnetic excitation, if necessary a means of raising and lowering the releasable element is matched to the weight of the module or installed new, and the releasable element is removed from the structure with the aid of the means for raising and lowering, and the module with the turbine generator units is positioned in the structure, instead of or in addition to the releasable element, with the aid of the means for raising and lowering, the turbine generator units arranged in the module being connected to a power supply network via a line for carrying away the electrical power generated by the turbine generator units and, if required, given at least partial outflow of the stored medium through the turbine generator<br>
units of the module, electrical power being generated, and, if appropriate in order to reproduce the storage function of the structure, the module being removed and replaced by the releasable element.<br>
In operation, the turbine generator units connected to one another to form a module are flowed through by the medium at the same time, rotatably mounted turbine blades and rotors firmly connected to the latter so as to rotate with them and having permanent magnetic poles belonging to the module being set rotating. Electrical power is generated in interaction with stators arranged concentrically around the rotors, fixed against rotation in the module and belonging to the generators of the turbine generator units. In the event that the invention is used on a structure which is already present, the environmental aspect can be increased, since no infrastructure measures which impair the environment have to be put in place, instead the existing infrastructure can be used.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the present invention emerge from the dependent subclaims.<br>
The permanent magnetic excitation can now be arranged either on the rotor or alternatively on the stator. Depending on the constructional stipulations and requirements, the most beneficial variants can be used.<br>
A design variant of a turbine generator unit which can be used very advantageously is a tubular turbine generator unit. The fixing of these turbine generator units is advantageously carried out in a manner known per se such that the turbine generator units are supported on the associated frame or frame elements of the module in the area of the turbine rotor and/or in its substantially cylindrical area of the turbine housing.<br>
The guide vanes arranged upstream in the flow direction of the turbine rotors of the turbine generator units of a module can be used at the same time to hold the turbine generator units, which results in a further constructional simplification.<br>
Optimum efficiency is achieved by the turbine generator units being provided with intake pipes through which the medium driving the turbine generator units can flow.<br>
A further design variant of a turbine generator unit which can be used very advantageously is obtained if the turbine of a turbine generator unit has rotatably mounted turbine blades which, in the area of their outer ends, are connected by a force fit to an annular rotor of the generator of the turbine generator unit, and the stator of the generator of the turbine generator unit being arranged concentrically around the rotor, fixed against rotation in the module. As a result of the beneficial position of the center of gravity of such turbine generator units in relation to the fixing of the units themselves, but also in relation to anchoring the module and the load-holding means, oscillations and tilting moments are in particular avoided, so that the construction of the module itself, but also its guidance and mounting, can advantageously be designed to have smaller dimensions and therefore to be lighter. The central area of the turbine generator units, which is stressed by the tubular generator in conventional installations, is reduced in size in the solution according to the invention and can be used as an additional flow cross section, so that the efficiency of the turbine generator units may additionally be improved.<br>
Optimum utilization of the energy available in the<br>
medium with a small space requirement results from the fact that the opening defined by the rotor and stator of the generator can be flowed through by the medium that drives the turbine.<br>
Optimum efficiency of such turbine generator units is achieved by the turbine generator units being provided with inlet pipes which can be flowed through by the medium that drives the turbine generator units.<br>
An improvement in the space requirement of the turbine generator units in the module results if the stators of adjacent turbine generator units of a module are arranged immediately beside one another and/or one above another.<br>
The inflow area can be optimized further if the inlet pipes of adjacent turbine generator units are arranged immediately beside one another and/or one above another, the opening cross section of the inlet pipe in the area of the turbine being smaller than the opening cross section of the inlet pipe at the open end lying upstream of the turbine - in the flow direction - and the difference between these opening cross sections being greater than or equal to the sum of the cross section of the rotor and of the stator of the generator.<br>
A particularly simple construction results from the fact that the inlet pipe in the area of the turbine or the generator is constructed as a housing in which the stator is anchored. Furthermore, it is advantageous to arrange guide vanes in the inlet pipes of the turbine generator units, by means of which vanes the turbine and the rotor of the generator are held.<br>
Particularly simple and cost-effective equipment results from the fact that the annular space between<br>
rotor and stator of the generator is connected to a spatial section which is flowed through by the medium that flows through the turbine, and that this annular space can be flowed through by the medium. The annular space on both sides of the rotor or generator can preferably be flowed through over the entire circumference. In this case, the requirement for sealing is dispensed with, and the units or modules can be configured to be particularly cost-effective and largely maintenance-free and are additionally cooled by the medium flowing past. In this case, the stator and the rotor are intrinsically sealed against penetration of the medium flowing past and designed to be insulated electrically with respect to the medium.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the gap between rotor and stator of the generator is sealed with respect to the medium that drives the turbine, and the annular space between rotor and stator is filled with a gas, in particular air.. In this case, it is advantageous to arrange the seal along the rotor, to be specific the seal can be fixed optionally to the rotating part or to the stator.<br>
A further improvement with regard to the flexibility of such equipment results from the fact that the turbine is designed to be rotatable in both directions in order to generate power.<br>
Furthermore, the efficiency of a module can be improved further by the alignment of the turbine blades with respect to the flow direction of the medium being adjustable.<br>
In a preferred, particularly economic variant of the equipment according to the invention, the electrical output of the generator of an individual turbine generator  unit  is  between  100 kW  and  1000 kW,<br>
preferably between 200 kW and 700 kW.<br>
An installation can be produced and operated economically and efficiently in particular when the number of turbine generator units arranged one above another and/or beside one another is between 5 and 500, preferably between 50 and 250.<br>
A further improvement with regard to the dimensioning results if the turbine generator units or the modules can be connected to a device for raising and lowering.<br>
Likewise, it is quite particularly advantageous if the turbine generator units can be cooled, at least partially, by the medium flowing past, since then the cooling system can be designed to be smaller or, in the event of complete cooling by the medium flowing past, can even be dispensed with completely. The advantages associated with this with regard to construction, size, weight and costs, can be seen directly.<br>
Further advantages and features of the invention emerge from the folLowing, nonrestrictive description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the appended figures 1 to 3, which show the following:<br>
Figure 1  shows  a  section  through  an  exemplary<br>
embodiment of a turbine generator unit of so called<br>
Straflo design,<br>
Figure 2  shows  a  section  through  an  exemplary<br>
embodiment  of  a  turbine  generator  unit  of  tubular<br>
turbine design, and<br>
Figure 3  shows  a  section  through  a  hydroelectric<br>
installation having an arrangement of a plurality of<br>
turbine generator units.<br>
The turbine generator unit 1 according to figure 1 has<br>
a turbine 2 with turbine blades 11 which are connected by a force fit to one another and to a shaft 8 which is rotatably mounted by means of rolling-contact, sliding and/or ball bearings in a pear-shaped bearing housing 13 of the turbine generator unit 1 and is sealed against the medium, for example water, flowing around it. The bearing housing 13 is fixed to a conical inlet pipe 7 by means of guide vanes 6.<br>
Located in the area of the ends of the turbine blades 11 is the generator 3, which has an annular rotor 5 belonging to the generator 3 of the turbine generator unit 1 and which is connected by a force fit to the turbine blades 11. Arranged concentrically around the rotor 5 is the likewise annular stator 4 of the generator 3, which is arranged fixed against rotation in the module and, in the exemplary embodiment shown, is anchored m a section of the inlet pipe 7 constructed as a housing. The rotor 5 of the generator 3 has permanent magnet poles, not specifically illustrated here, which serve as excitation for the generator 3. The stator 4 comprises, in a manner sufficiently well known, of the lamination pack 10 and the windings 9.<br>
Between the rotor 5 and the stator 4 there is a likewise annular gap inter space 14 which, in the present exemplary embodiment, is filled with gas, for example air, and in which the rotor 5 is sealed off with respect to the medium flowing through the inlet pipe 7, for example by means of a seal between the end faces of the rotor 5 and the opposite end face of the housing formed by the inlet pipe 7. Alternatively, this gap interspace 14 can also be flowed through by the medium that flows through the inlet pipe 7, so that this gap 14 is continuously filled with the medium, for example water, in operation and may possibly be flowed through. For this purpose, it is of course necessary<br>
for the electrical parts of the generator 3 to be designed to be insulated with respect to the medium.<br>
Similar turbines with generators are already known for applications as individual stationary units with a comparatively high output class. Inter alia, a turbine generator set of this type is described in US 4,046,403, US 4,123,666 and US 4,464,580.<br>
Figure 2 now shows a further exemplary embodiment of a turbine generator unit 1 having a permanent-magnet excited generator 3. In this example, the generator 3 is arranged in a pear-shaped generator housing 12. The rotor 5 of the generator 3 is connected by a form fit to a shaft 8, which is rotatably mounted by means of rolling-contact, sliding and/or ball bearings in the generator housing 12 and which is driven by a turbine 2. For this purpose, a turbine 2 with turbine blades 11, which is set rotating by the medium flowing past, is arranged with a form fit at the end of the shaft 8 facing away from the generator 3 in the flow direction.<br>
The rotor 5 has permanent magnet poles, not specifically illustrated, which serve as excitation for the generator 3. The stator 4 is fixed in a fixed location directly on the inner wall of the generator housing 12. Here, the generator 3 is cooled exclusively via the medium flowing past.<br>
The generator housing 12 is sealed off against the medium, for example water, flowing around it, and is fixed to a conical intake pipe 15 by means of guide vanes 6.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an installation for generating electrical power from a flowing medium, specifically water, having a dam structure 20 by means of which an area with a<br>
higher water level (UPPER POOL) can be separated from an area with a lower water level (LOWER POOL) , in the present case by a weir 21 which can be raised and lowered by being pivoted about a horizontal axis, the water being able to flow from the area with the higher water level into the area with the lower water level when the weir 21 is in the raised position, and said flow being prevented when the weir 21 is in the lowered position.<br>
Furthermore, on both sides of the weir 21, the dam structure 20 has adjacent vertical lateral guides 22, which are used to guide and support turbine generator units 1 which, in the present case, are arranged beside one another and one above another and are combined in a matrix form to form a module 23 which, in the exemplary embodiment shown, is integrated in a frame 24 which is additionally equipped to accommodate further elements, such as a rake, service equipment and the like. In a departure from the present exemplary embodiment, however, the individual turbine generator units 1 can also be arranged in the form of a honeycomb or in any other desired structure, for example offset in the flow direction, etc. In this example, turbine generator units 1 in the so-called Straflo design, according to the description relating to fig. 1, are used, it being possible of course, without restricting the generality, for any other desired turbine generator unit, such as a tubular turbine, according to fig. 2, to be used.<br>
On its upper side, the module 23 has load lifting means 25 for a crane 26, which is arranged on the dam structure 20 and by means of which the module 23 can be raised and lowered, it being possible for all the turbine generators units 1 of a module 23 in the lowered state of the latter for generating electrical power from the water flowing through the turbines.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
