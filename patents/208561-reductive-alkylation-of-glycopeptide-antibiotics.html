The present invention is directed to improved methods for reductively alkylating glycopeptide antibiotics.  The invention provides increased regioselectivity of reaction among multiple sites and thereby results in increased yields of the preferred product.  In particular, the invention is directed to methods for preferentially conducting a reductive alkylation reaction on an amine on the saccharide of a glycopeptide antibiotic having one or more additional amines.<br>
The essence of the invention is the discovery that conducting the reaction in the presence of soluble copper favors preferential reaction with the amine on the saccharide position, and thereby improves the yields of the reductive alkylation at this site.  The initial step is the formation of a copper complex of the glycopeptide antibiotic, which subsequently undergoes the reductive alkylation.  This invention is also directed to these copper complexes of the starting glycopeptide antibiotics.  The alkylated glycopeptide antibiotic products are obtained as copper complexes, which are another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to reductive alkylation of glycopeptide antibiotics.<br>
The glycopeptide antibiotics are a large class of substances either produced by microorganisms, or produced by microorganisms and thereafter subsequently modified in part.<br><br>
Two of these, vancomycin and teicoplanin, are sold as antibacterial products, but many others have been discovered and are being considered for development, especially since the emergence in the late 1980s of resistance to various antibiotics, including the glycopeptides themselves.  The entire class of glycopeptide antibiotics is well described in "Glycopeptide Antibiotics", edited by Ramakrishnan Nagarajan (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1994).  Among the more recently discovered glycopeptides are those known as A82846A (also called ereomomycin), A82846B (also known as chloroorienticin A), A82846C (also known as orienticin C), and orienticin A.  The present invention is preferred for use with vancomycin type glycopeptide antibiotics, including vancomycin, A82846A, A82846B, A82846C, and orienticin A; the invention is especially preferred for use with A82846B.<br>
Many modifications of naturally-occurring glycopeptides have been made.  Among the modifications are reductive alkylations of reactive amine(s) in glycopeptides.  See, for example, U.S. 4,698,327 describing reductive alkylations of vancomycin, and EPO 435 503 Al and EPO 667 353 Al, both of which describe reductive alkylations of a variety of glycopeptides including vancomycin, A82846A, A82846B, A82846C, and orienticin A.  These references describe reductive alkylations which introduce into the parent glycopeptides a great variety of alkyl groups.<br>

The present invention can be utilised to make the alkylated glycopeptides described in these references. Preferred alkylated glycopeptides which can be prepared by the present process include the following:<br>
N4-n-octylA82 846B<br>
N4-n-decylA8284 6B<br>

-16-<br>
N4-{p-tert-butoxybenzyl)A82846B N4-(p-pentyloxyben2yl)A82846B N4-(p-hexyloxybenzyl)A82846B<br>
N4-(o-hexyloxybenzyl)A82 846B N4-(p-heptyloxybenzyl)A82846B N4-(p-octyloxybenzyl)A82846B N4-phenethylA8284 6B N4-(4-phenylbenzyl)A82846B N4-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzylA82846B N4-(4-(4-methylbenzyloxy)benzyl)A82846B N4-(4-(4-ethylbenzyloxy)benzyl)A82846B N4-(4-(4-chlorophenethyl)benzyl)A82846B N4-{4-(2~(4-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl)benzyl)A82846B. The references noted above describe the reductive alkylation as comprising a first step, in which the glycopeptide is reacted with the respective aldehyde or ketone to form a Schiff's base, which in a second step is reduced to the desired alkylated product.  In one variation of this procedure, EPO 667 353 Al describes a process in which the reducing agent is added simultaneously with the glycopeptide and aldehyde or ketone.  The references say that any chemical reducing agent can be employed, but the references also suggest a preference for sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
Essentially all glycopeptides contain multiple reactive sites.  Manipulation of these multiple sites is not uniformly advantageous.  It is sometimes desired to react<br><br>
-17-<br>
the glycopeptide regioselectivity, to have the reaction occur at only one of multiple sites.  This is equally true in the case of reductive alkylations of glycopeptides.  An example of this is A82846B.  While derivatives alkylated on the leucine amine (N1) and/or the monosaccharide (N6) are active as antibacterials, alkylation of the N4 (disaccharide) amine appears to be preferred.<br>
Pharmaceutical practices require a relatively pure form, and therefore preferential reaction of the N4 site is desirable in order to achieve a highly pure N4-alkylated product.<br>
The present invention provides a technique for obtaining reaction preferentially on the amine on a saccharide at the N4 position in the glycopeptide antibiotic.  In the case of vancomycin, A82846A, A82846B, A82846C, and orienticin A, the present process reduces reactivity at sites N1 and N6 and thereby increases reaction selectivity for the N4 (disaccharide) site.  The invention requires the initial preparation of a soluble copper complex of the glycopeptide, which is then reductively alkylated. The soluble copper complex is achieved by reacting the glycopeptide antibiotic with copper, typically by adding a source of soluble copper to a reaction mixture containing the glycopeptide antibiotic.  The identity of the copper source is not critical, so long as it is at least partially soluble and does not negatively impact the pH.  Such a copper salt can be used in anhydrous or hydrated form.  A preferred source of copper is copper (II) acetate, most conveniently employed as the hydrate.<br><br>
Supplying copper to the reaction mixture results in the initial production of a copper complex with the glycopeptide antibiotic starting material, typically in a 1:1 ratio. This copper complex of the glycopeptide antibiotic starting material is one of the features of the present invention.<br>
The reducing agent to be employed in the present invention is sodium cyanoborohydride or pyridine.borane complex.<br>
The identity of the solvent is important.  Straight methanol has given high yields, and it is expected that methanol somewhat diluted as with DMF or DMSO would provide acceptable yields.  Other solvents have not produced satisfactory results.  Therefore, the reaction solvent is at least predominantly methanol.<br>
The reaction should be conducted at a pH of 6-8, and preferably at a pH of 6.3-7.0.<br>
The amounts of reactants and reagents to be employed are not critical; amounts to maximize the yield of product will vary somewhat with the identity of the reactants.  The reaction consumes the glycopeptide antibiotic and the aldehyde or ketone in equimolar amounts.  A slight excess of the aldehyde or ketone, e.g., 1.3 to 1.7:1, is preferred. The amount of the glycopeptide antibiotic to be used must be corrected for its purity.  The reaction consumes an equimolar amount of the reducing agent.  At least that amount should be employed, and &amp; slight excess is preferred. The amount of soluble copper is not critical when employing sodium cyanoborohydride as reducing agent.  When employing<br><br>
pyridine.borane as reducing agent, the amount of soluble copper to be employed is more important, since excess copper will react with the pyridine.borane.  Regardless of the identity of the reducing agent, the present process first results in the formation of a 1:1 complex with the glycopeptide antibiotic; therefore, the copper is preferably present in an amount approximately equimolar with the glycopeptide antibiotic.  Amounts exceeding one molar equivalent (in the case of pyridine.borane} or two molar equivalents {in the case of sodium cyanoborohydride) are undesirable.<br>
Summarizing the foregoing, the ideal amounts to be employed are a ratio of:<br>
glycopeptide:aldehyde or ketone:reducing agent:copper salt of:<br>
1:1.3 to 1.5:1.3:1 with the exception that when using pyridine-borane complex as reducing agent, the preferred ratio is: 1:1.3 to 1.7:1.5:0.9 to 1.0. The concentration of the reactants in the solvent has some bearing on the process.  Methanol volume relative to mass of glycopeptide antibiotic can vary from 50:1 to 500:1; a 100:1 dilution appears to be a useful, practical ratio, although higher dilutions may give slightly higher yields.<br>
The temperature at which the process is carried out is not critical.  Reaction mixtures in methanol boil at about 67°C, thereby setting the maximum temperature when employing straight methanol as the solvent.  Higher<br><br>
temperatures are of course possible when employing mixtures of methanol or when operating under pressure.  Lower temperatures can be tolerated, but preferably not lower than about 450c.  The ideal condition for sodium cyanoborohydride as reducing agent is the use of straight methanol and conducting the reaction at reflux; the ideal condition for pyridine.borane as reducing agent is also the use of straight methanol but at temperatures of about 58-63°C.<br>
Some product is produced with even short reaction times.  Longer reaction times, such as from 6 hours to 48 hours, are preferred.  However, the ideal reaction time appears to be approximately 20 to 25 hours.  Longer times may increase the yield of products alkylated at undesired sites in the glycopeptide antibiotic.<br>
In carrying out the present invention, the glycopeptide antibiotic and copper are preferably mixed in a solvent, creating the soluble copper complex of the glycopeptide antibiotic, and the aldehyde and reducing agents are then added.  However, the precise order of addition is not critical.  Portionwise addition of the reducing agent is preferred, and is required for good results when employing pyridine.borane complex as reducing agent.  The reaction is continued for a period of time, after which the product is produced and can be separated from the reaction mixture.<br>
Upon the completion of the reaction period, the reaction mixture is preferably quenched, as by the addition of sodium borohydride.  This reagent consumes residual<br><br>
-20-aldehyde or ketone and thereby prevents further undesired reactions.<br>
The product is isolated from the reaction mixture as a copper complex of the alkylated glycopeptide.  Isolation is achieved by concentration of the reaction mixture and precipitation of the complex by addition of an antisolvent such as ethyl acetate, acetone, 1-propanol, isopropyl alcohol, or preferably acetonitrile.  The complex can be broken by aqueous treatment at pH 24, freeing the simple alkylated glycopeptide product, which can, if desired, be purified in conventional manner.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention and will enable those skilled in the art to practice the same.<br>

The foregoing examples illustrate several facets of the present invention.  First, copper must be supplied to the reaction mixture in a form which is at least partially soluble:  Copper salts such as CuF2 and Cu(OH)2, which are nearly insoluble in methanol, are not effective.  Further, the copper salt preferably should allow full solubility of the starting glycopeptide antibiotic, and ideally at the preferred pH.  The salts which work the best (Cu<oac cu and afford complete dissolution of nucleus solutions></oac><br>
33<br>
at about pH 6.7.  The salts which afford improvements over no additive but are not optimal (Cu (O2CCF3)2, CuCl2, CuBr2) either afford solubility of nucleus but at less than optimal pH (CuBr2 and Cu(02CCF3)2) or are at optimal pH but do not afford complete nucleus solubility (CuCl2).<br>
In summary, the copper must be in a form which is at least partially soluble, and should allow or maintain full solubility of the starting glycopeptide antibiotic at an acceptable pH, typically 6.3-7.  Also, these experiments were conducted with suboptimal amounts of the copper; further advantage from the present invention is obtained at higher copper concentration.<br>
