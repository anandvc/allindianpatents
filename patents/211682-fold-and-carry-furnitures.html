				<td>2 FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present  invention  relates to an  improved  portable folding furniture.     More  particularly   the  present   invention   relates   to manufacturing of portable fold and carry furnitures like chair, table, cot, charpoys by assembling only three iron or steel tubes on a common hinge.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chairs, table, cots and charpoys mostly remain indoor or at best can be carried to garden adjacent to house. One can not savor the luxury of sitting in his own chair really "outside", say in situations like standing in the que or public places like station or park. Likewise, if the person is on a motel, wherever he can find, or can settle for cramped inside of a car or simply stand.<br><br>
3<br>
Of course, one can rest in a chair outside, unless and until it is separately carted by the outside agencies to the site where public functions or get-together parties are taking place.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the above background it is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a manufacturing of a novel portable fold and carry furnitures by assembling only three iron or steel tubes on a common hinge.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a manufacturing of portable fold and carry furnitures, which is more handy and less costly.<br>
A further object of the present Invention is to propose a manufacturing of portable fold and carry furnitures by assembling only three iron or steel tubes on a common hinge which can be<br><br>
4<br>
mounted at any place and any where by using fastening tools and can be dismantled quickly.<br>
A still further object of the present Invention is to propose a<br>
manufacturing of portable fold and carry furnitures by assembling<br>
only three iron or steel tubes on a common hinge which occupies less<br>
space and transferable.<br>
An yet further object of he present invention is to propose a manufacturing of portable fold and carry furnitures by assembling only three iron or steel tubes on a common hinge which can be carried in a bag, dickey of car and back seat of a cycle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The manufacturing of a portable folding furniture comprising an assembly of three u shaped iron or steel tubes, which are fastened on a common hinge. Such tubes can be used to form various shapes like back-seat, hind-legs and seat of a chair only by changing the<br><br>
5<br>
orientation and locking the tubes at different zones by means of fastenable articles. The front legs are attached to the bend of such smallest tubing which again can unfold and be locked as the front leg of chair system.<br>
They all can fold into one structure and In once place two such chairs can be joined with the help of connecting rods to form a table and charpoy or even sofa-cum cot, divan-cum-bed etc.<br>
According to the invention there Is provided<br>
BRIEF DESCRITPION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig-1 shows a schematic diagram of a chair by assembling the three tubes,,<br>
Fig-2 shows a schematic diagram of a chair in folded condition.<br><br>
6<br>
Fig-3 shows a schematic diagram of a chair after canning with a flexible material.<br>
DETAILS DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present Invention relates to manufacturing of a portable,folding and carry furniture / chair comprising an assembly of three main parts of iron or steel U shaped tube (1, 2,3) as shown in Fig - 1.<br>
First U shaped tube part (1) constitutes the upper back part of the chair. Second U shaped tube part (2) constitutes the horizontal part of the chair. Third U shaped tube part (3) constitutes the lower back part of the chair. One common hinge (14) at R.H.S. where-the first end of U tube part 1,2,3 are fastened by a fastening means and one common hinge (15) at LH.S. where the second end of U tube parts 1,2,3 are fastened by a fastening means. One I shaped Tie-Connecting member (9) is fastened with In between second arm of U shaped part (2) and second arm of U shaped part (1) by a fastening means at 12 and 13 at the upper part.<br>
A second I shaped Tie-connecting member (8) is fastened in between a first arm of U shaped part (2) and a first arm of U shaped part (3)<br><br>
7<br>
by a fastening means at hinge (10,11). Two slideable rings (18,19) inserted into horizontal U shaped part (2) from both opening end and disposed at both side of middle arm of U shaped part (2) and fixed there by a fastening means. One end of first vertical tube part (4) and one end of second vertical tube part (5) are inserted into the hollow part of slideable ring (18) and the hollow part of slideable ring (19) and mounted there by fastening means.<br>
Fig-2 shows all the three U shaped members (1,2,3) are in closed condition and lying in one plane of dimension and in folded condition it looks like a U shaped article which is easily carriable.<br>
Fig-3 shows the open space (20) between the 1st arm and 3rd arm of U shaped part (2) and open space (21) of first arm and third arm of U shaped part (1) are canned with any commercial type canning of plastic rope or jute rope or cotton ribbon or any flexible material.<br>
As showing fig (2) for unfolding the chair, first put one hand at U shaped part (1) and put other hand at U shaped part (2) and pull them keeping part (2) In horizontal position and next pull the U shaped part (3) to place lower back part of the chair.<br><br>
