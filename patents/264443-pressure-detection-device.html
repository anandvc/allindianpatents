				<td>Description<br>
Pressure detection device<br>
The present invention relates to a pressure detection device<br>
for the detection of pressures in lines or containers which<br>
contain a pressure-transmitting fluid, and, in particular, also<br>
to a pressure detection device for use in motor vehicles.<br>
In the measurement of pressures, for example the oil pressure<br>
in internal combustion engines or the rail pressure in common-<br>
rail engines, the leaktightness between a device for detecting<br>
the pressure and the connection, for example, to the line or to<br>
the container having the fluid whose pressure is to be measured<br>
often has to satisfy stringent requirements. Pressure detection<br>
devices are therefore frequently used which have a metal<br>
connection piece as a junction piece for the connection. The<br>
use of a metal connection piece has the advantage, in<br>
particular, that high screw-on forces or screw-on torques can<br>
be employed during assembly and, inter alia, the stringent<br>
requirements to be met as regards pressure tightness of the<br>
junction can therefore also be fulfilled. In addition, such<br>
pressure detection devices may be used even at high<br>
temperatures.<br>
Conventionally, the actual pressure sensor element, for example<br>
a ceramic pressure sensor element or a special piezoresistive<br>
measuring cell, is then introduced into the metal connection<br>
piece. The pressure sensor element is connected to a circuit<br>
board, typically by wire bonding. Since the connection of the<br>
pressure detection device is to take place via a plug<br>
connection, such a pressure detection device comprises a plug<br>
connector part with contact elements. The plug connector part<br>
is usually connected to the metal connection piece by means of<br>
the flanging of a corresponding portion of the metal connection<br>
piece, and therefore<br><br>
it is not possible to have a simple junction of the contact<br>
elements with the connections of the circuit board. The contact<br>
elements are therefore connected to corresponding connections<br>
of the circuit board by means of flexible foils having<br>
conductor tracks and press tongs, or they are designed as knife<br>
contacts and are connected to the connections of the circuit<br>
board via corresponding lines.<br>
The production of such a pressure detection device is therefore<br>
comparatively complicated.<br>
The object on which the present invention is based, therefore,<br>
is to provide a pressure detection device which can be produced<br>
in a simple way.<br>
The object is achieved by means of a pressure detection device,<br>
with a base element for holding the pressure detection device,<br>
which base element has a connecting duct for the supply of a<br>
pressurized fluid, with an extended carrier body, which extends<br>
along a plugging direction, at one end has a plug connector<br>
portion for plugging together with a complementary plug<br>
connector in the plugging direction, at the other end is<br>
connected to the base element and has a pressure duct connected<br>
to the connecting duct, and possesses a reception orifice<br>
running transversely with respect to the plugging direction and<br>
communicating with the pressure duct, and with a pressure<br>
sensor element which is inserted, pressure-tight, into the<br>
reception orifice, so that one of the pressure-sensitive sensor<br>
surfaces of the pressure sensor element is exposed to pressure<br>
from the pressure duct, and which is connected to contact<br>
elements in the plug connector portion for the transmission of<br>
signals.<br>
A carrier body is understood, in particular, to mean a carrier<br><br>
body which, seen as a whole, is not developed. Preferably,<br>
although the length of the carrier body in the plugging<br>
direction<br><br>
is greater than the extent transversely to the plugging<br>
direction, this does not necessarily need to be the case.<br>
Such a pressure detection device can be produced very simply,<br>
since the mounting of the pressure sensor element can take<br>
place through the reception orifice of the carrier part which<br>
at the same time functions as a plug connector. This mounting<br>
may in this case take place before or after the connection of<br>
the carrier body to the base element which serves for holding<br>
the pressure detection device on, or for connecting the<br>
pressure detection device to, the line or the container or a<br>
connection of the line or container.<br>
Furthermore, due to the extended form of the pressure detection<br>
device, a particularly simple mounting of the latter on a line<br>
or a container is obtained, since both the fastening of the<br>
base element and that of a plug complementary to the plug<br>
connector portion can take place from the same direction and<br>
therefore occupy only a small amount of space. This is of<br>
considerable advantage particularly in motor vehicle<br>
construction.<br>
Further, by the pressure sensor element being arranged in the<br>
carrier part, a partially thermal decoupling from the base<br>
element can be obtained, which allows more accurate pressure<br>
measurements even in the case of varying temperatures of the<br>
line or of the container. Moreover, a thermal decoupling of the<br>
pressure-carrying fluid from the base element in the region of<br>
the pressure sensor element can occur, which may likewise lead<br>
to higher measuring accuracy. This is the case particularly<br>
when, as is preferred, the pressure duct ends in the reception<br>
orifice and, if appropriate, in the carrier body, and therefore<br>
no appreciable convection of the fluid in the pressure<br><br>
detection device occurs.<br>
The base element may, in principle, consist of any desired<br>
material suitable for holding. Preferably,<br><br>
it consists of metal. This has the advantage that high strength<br>
is afforded, along with a low price and simple production. In<br>
particular, it can be formed advantageously in a simple way by<br>
means of known methods.<br>
The base element may, in principle, be configured in any<br>
desired way for connection to a line or a container.<br>
Preferably, however, the base element has an external thread<br>
for fastening in an orifice of a line or of a container having<br>
a corresponding internal thread. The use of a thread not only<br>
allows reliable fastening, but also makes it possible to have a<br>
very good leaktightness of the connection.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment makes it possible for the carrier<br>
body to be connected to the base element by means of a flanged<br>
connection. For this purpose, the carrier body may have,<br>
particularly at the corresponding end, a peripheral flange<br>
which is surrounded, after flanging, by a corresponding portion<br>
of the base element.<br>
The base element does not necessarily need to have special<br>
structures in order to be mounted on a line or a container. For<br>
example, it could have a cylindrical surface area which, during<br>
mounting, is held by means of tongs. Preferably, however, the<br>
base element has at least one mounting structure, preferably on<br>
its outer surface, particularly preferably in the form of a<br>
hexagonal structure. Preferably, the largest diameter of the<br>
carrier body is smaller than the smallest diameter of the<br>
hexagonal structure. The advantage of this is that mounting can<br>
then take place from the plugging direction, for example by<br>
means of a socket wrench similar to a socket wrench for the<br>
tightening of spark plugs.<br>
The pressure duct may basically be connected to the connecting<br>
duct in any desired way. This is understood to mean that<br><br>
the pressure detection device is designed such that a fluid can<br>
transmit pressure from the connecting duct to a fluid in the<br>
pressure duct. In particular, the two ducts can communicate,<br>
that is to say allow an exchange of the fluid, that is to say<br>
of a gas or a liquid. For example, the connecting duct may be<br>
arranged with its mouth directly opposite the mouth of the<br>
pressure duct and consequently be connected to the latter.<br>
However, the connecting duct and the pressure duct may also be<br>
connected via a chamber, for example between the base element<br>
and carrier body.<br>
An embodiment of the pressure detection device which can be<br>
produced in a particularly simple way is obtained when the<br>
connecting duct and a portion of the pressure duct which is<br>
connected to said connecting duct run rectilinearly.<br>
The pressure duct may, in principle, run in any desired way. In<br>
a particularly preferred embodiment, in particular a<br>
development of the embodiment described in the above paragraph,<br>
the carrier body is designed such that the pressure duct leads,<br>
with an end portion running transversely or at an inclination<br>
with respect to the plugging direction, into the reception<br>
orifice. The advantage of this is that the pressure duct can be<br>
produced In a particularly simple way; in particular, it may<br>
then have only two rectilinear portions adjoining one another.<br>
An oblique run is in this case understood to mean that a<br>
longitudinal axis of the end portion forms with the plugging<br>
direction an angle greater than 1°, preferably greater than<br>
10°.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the carrier body is designed such<br>
that there lies between the pressure duct and the reception<br>
orifice a web on which the pressure sensor element or a carrier<br>
element for the pressure sensor element is held and/or lies. This<br><br>
embodiment has the advantage that, on the one hand, a compact<br>
set-up can be achieved and, on the other hand, a simple<br>
introduction of the pressure sensor element<br><br>
or of a carrier element having the pressure sensor element into<br>
the reception orifice and a simple fastening thereof in the<br>
latter become possible.<br>
In principle, the carrier body may be of multipart design.<br>
Preferably, however, it is designed in one piece. The carrier<br>
body can thus be highly stable, but at the same time can be<br>
produced in a simple way. Materials to be considered, from<br>
which the carrier body may be manufactured, are in this case<br>
not only metal, but, above all, ceramic materials and plastics,<br>
in particular plastics resistant to high temperatures.<br>
The carrier body basically needs merely to be designed in<br>
extended form. In this case, in particular, it may also have<br>
projections, for example the fastening flange already<br>
mentioned, or set-back regions, for example in the region of<br>
the plug connector portion. A particularly simple production of<br>
the carrier body is obtained if the carrier body is cylindrical<br>
at least with the exception of the plug connector portion and,<br>
if present, the fastening flange.<br>
In principle, the pressure sensor element may be arranged in<br>
the reception orifice in any desired orientation suitable for<br>
its functioning. It is preferable, however, if the pressure<br>
sensor element is arranged such that a perpendicular to a<br>
pressure-sensitive surface of the pressure sensor element runs<br>
orthogonally or obliquely with respect to the plugging<br>
direction. This orientation of the pressure sensor element has<br>
the advantage that this or a carrier element carrying this can<br>
separate, pressure-tight, the reception orifice from the<br>
pressure duct in said reception orifice.<br>
The signals from the pressure sensor element may, in principle,<br>
be processed outside the carrier body. Preferably, however,<br>
evaluation electronics for the evaluation and, if appropriate,<br><br>
activation of the pressure sensor element are arranged in the<br>
carrier body, thus reducing disturbances of the signals by the<br>
pressure sensor element and allowing a simple electrical<br>
connection.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the pressure detection device, the<br>
pressure sensor element and evaluation electronics for the<br>
activation and/or evaluation of signals from the pressure<br>
sensor element are integrated on a chip which is connected, in<br>
particular contacted, with the contact elements for signal<br>
transmission. Thus, only one component needs to be fastened in<br>
the carrier body, and the influence of noise fields on signal<br>
transmission between the pressure sensor element and evaluation<br>
electronics can be greatly reduced. The chip may also be<br>
interpreted as a carrier element for the pressure sensor<br>
element.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the pressure detection<br>
device, the pressure sensor element and evaluation electronics<br>
for the activation and/or evaluation of signals from the<br>
pressure sensor element are held on a carrier element, the<br>
evaluation electronics being connected to the contact elements<br>
for signal transmission. This embodiment, too, has the<br>
advantage that only one component needs to be inserted into the<br>
carrier body and fastened in the latter. In this case, in<br>
particular, a ceramic plate or a circuit board may serve as<br>
carrier element.<br>
A further advantage of the embodiments mentioned in the last<br>
two paragraphs is that the chip or connections of the carrier<br>
element can be contacted directly with the contact elements,<br>
for which purpose, in particular, bonding wires or wire bonds<br>
or other flexible conjunctions may be used. It is also<br>
possible, however, to select other contacting possibilities<br>
mentioned in the introduction.<br>
The fastening of the chip or of the carrier element to the<br>
carrier body may take place basically in any desired way. The<br>
advantage of particularly simple mounting arises when the chip<br>
or the carrier element is adhesively bonded to the carrier<br><br>
body. Preferably, an adhesive is used which gives an elastic<br>
adhesive bond, so that<br><br>
a compensation of mechanical stresses between the chip and the<br>
carrier element becomes possible.<br>
Particularly during use in the motor vehicle sector, the<br>
pressure detection device may be exposed to moisture and/or to<br>
other liquids or gases which may possibly impair the<br>
functioning of the device. To protect against such influences,<br>
preferably, the chip or the carrier element is covered with<br>
protective material. This protective material may be, in<br>
particular, a gel which fills the reception orifice over its<br>
cross section as completely as possible.<br>
Further, the pressure detection device may comprise a cover<br>
which closes the reception orifice. As a result, the pressure<br>
sensor element or the chip or the carrier element and also<br>
protective material, present if appropriate, are protected, in<br>
particular, against mechanical influences.<br>
However, the cover may also fulfill further functions. Thus, in<br>
a preferred embodiment of the pressure detection device, the<br>
cover closes the reception orifice, gas-tight, with the<br>
exception of a connecting orifice. This pressure detection<br>
device may then be used as a differential pressure detection<br>
device which detects the pressure difference between the<br>
pressure in the connecting duct and the pressure in the<br>
connecting orifice.<br>
The pressure detection device may, however, also be designed<br>
for the detection of absolute pressures. For this purpose, the<br>
pressure sensor element is then designed for measuring an<br>
absolute pressure. For this purpose, the pressure sensor<br>
element is then designed for measuring an absolute pressure.<br>
For this purpose, for example, it may have a reference vacuum<br>
cell which contains a gas of known pressure.<br><br>
Alternatively, the pressure sensor element may be fastened to a<br>
bottom surface of the reception orifice, and the pressure duct<br>
may issue into the reception orifice between the bottom surface<br>
and that surface of the carrier body which lies transversely<br>
with<br><br>
respect to the plugging direction. In this case, preferably, a<br>
cover which closes off, pressure-tight, the reception orifice<br>
may be provided.<br>
According to a preferred development, the pressure detection<br>
device preferably further has a temperature sensor arranged on<br>
the pressure duct. Such a pressure detection device<br>
advantageously makes it possible to detect not only the<br>
pressure in a fluid, but also the temperature. Particularly<br>
preferably, the connections of the temperature sensor are<br>
contacted directly with contact elements in the plug connector<br>
portion.<br>
The pressure detection device may be designed for the<br>
measurement of pressures in various ranges, for example up to<br>
100 bar.<br>
The invention is further explained below, by way of example,<br>
with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic sectional illustration of a<br>
pressure detection device according to a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic sectional illustration of a<br>
pressure detection device according to a second<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
fig. 3 shows a diagrammatic sectional illustration of a<br>
pressure detection device according to a third<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
fig. 4 shows a diagrammatic sectional illustration of a<br>
pressure detection device according to a fourth<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, and<br><br>
fig. 5 shows a diagrammatic sectional illustration of a<br>
pressure detection device according to a fifth<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
A pressure detection device according to a first preferred<br>
embodiment comprises a base element 1, an extended carrier body<br>
2 which is manufactured from plastic and which at one end<br>
comprises a plug connector portion 3 for plugging together with<br>
a complementary plug connector, not shown in the figures, in a<br>
plugging direction S and at the other end comprises a fastening<br>
flange 4, and also a chip 5 with an integrated pressure sensor<br>
element 6 and with evaluation electronics for the activation of<br>
the pressure sensor element 6 and for the evaluation of signals<br>
from the pressure sensor element 6.<br>
The base element 1 is manufactured from metal and, for<br>
fastening in an internal thread of a connection of a pressure<br>
container having a pressure-carrying fluid, has an external<br>
thread 7 and, as a mounting structure, an outer hexagonal<br>
portion. An inverted type of construction for an external<br>
thread is likewise possible. The same applies to the design for<br>
a plug connection.<br>
Arranged parallel to the axis of the external thread 7 in the<br>
base element 1 is a connecting duct 8 which leads through the<br>
base element 1 and which serves for carrying the pressure-<br>
carrying fluid from the pressure container into the pressure<br>
detection device.<br>
The carrier body 2, which extends linearly in the plugging<br>
direction S, has a pressure duct 9 of L-shaped design, the<br>
longer leg 10 running, at the end having the fastening flange<br>
4, linearly in the plugging direction S and coaxially with the<br>
connecting duct 8. The connecting duct 8 therefore also runs in<br>
the plugging direction S.<br><br>
The leg 10 is continued into an end portion 11 which runs<br>
orthogonally with respect to the plugging direction S and which<br>
issues into a reception orifice 11 which is formed in the<br>
carrier body 2 and which extends transversely with respect to<br>
the plugging direction S from the outer surface of the carrier<br>
body 2 into the interior of the latter and serves for receiving<br>
the chip 5.<br>
The plug connector portion 3 of the carrier body 2 possesses a<br>
receptacle 12 for the plug region of a complementary plug<br>
connector and contact element ducts in which contact elements<br>
13 for the plug connector portion 3 are arranged, which reach<br>
into the reception orifice 11.<br>
The chip 5 is arranged in the reception orifice 11 such that<br>
one of the pressure-sensitive sensor surfaces 14 is oriented<br>
with its perpendicular orthogonally with respect to the<br>
plugging direction S and parallel to the direction of the end<br>
portion of the pressure duct 9.<br>
The chip 5 is fastened, pressure-tight,	to the bottom of the<br>
carrier body 2 by means of an adhesive	15, a portion of the<br>
chip being fastened on a web 16 between	the reception orifice<br>
11 and the pressure duct 9.<br>
The chip 5 is directly contacted or electrically connected with<br>
the contact elements 12 in the plug connector portion 3 by<br>
means of bonding wires 17. For protection against interfering<br>
pulses, a protective capacitor 18 is arranged on the contact<br>
elements.<br>
The reception orifice 11 is filled above the chip 5 with<br>
a protective gel 19 which, on the one hand, covers the chip 5<br>
and the bonding wires 17 and protects them from moisture and,<br>
on the other hand, allows a transmission of pressure from the<br><br>
region of the reception orifice 11 to the chip 5 or the<br>
pressure sensor element 6.<br>
The reception orifice 11 is covered by a cover 20.<br><br>
The carrier body 2 is seated on the base element 1 and is<br>
connected to the base element 1 at the outer hexagon 21 by<br>
means of a flanged connection. The gap between the carrier body<br>
2 and the base element is sealed off, pressure-tight, by a<br>
sealing element, for example an O-ring 22, for sealing off<br>
between metal and plastic, so that no significant pressure<br>
loss, as compared with the detection accuracy of the pressure<br>
sensor element 6, can occur.<br>
Since the diameter of the carrier body 2 is smaller than the<br>
largest outside diameter of the outer hexagon 21, the pressure<br>
detection device can be fastened in a simple way by means of a<br>
corresponding socket wrench with inner hexagon from the<br>
plugging direction S. Then for complete mounting, the<br>
complementary plug connector merely needs to be plugged into<br>
the receptacle 12 from the same direction.<br>
A pressure detection device according to a second preferred<br>
embodiment in fig. 2 differs from the first exemplary<br>
embodiment in the design and fastening of the cover 20 and in<br>
the design of the carrier body. All the other parts of the<br>
device are unchanged, and therefore the explanations regarding<br>
the first exemplary embodiment also apply here and the same<br>
reference symbols are used.<br>
The carrier body 23 differs from the carrier body 2 only in<br>
that a groove 24 is provided which runs peripherally around the<br>
reception orifice. All the other features are unchanged, and<br>
the same reference symbols are used for the unchanged features<br>
as in the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
The cover 25 differs from the cover 20, on the one hand, in a<br>
peripheral wall 26 which engages into the groove 24 and, on the<br>
other hand, in a connecting orifice or pressure leadthrough 27,<br>
by means of which the region below the cover 25 can be<br>
connected to a further pressure container.<br><br>
A sealing-off material is located between the cover 25 and the<br>
carrier body 23, in order to avoid pressure losses through the<br>
gap between these elements.<br>
This pressure detection device can therefore be used as a<br>
differential pressure detection device, by means of which the<br>
difference between the pressure in the connecting duct 8 and<br>
the pressure in the pressure leadthrough 27, propagated through<br>
the protective gel 19, can be detected.<br>
A pressure detection device according to a third preferred<br>
embodiment in fig. 3 differs from the first exemplary<br>
embodiment in the fastening of the cover 20, in the design of<br>
the carrier body and in the type of chip 5. All the other parts<br>
of the device are unchanged, and therefore the explanations<br>
regarding the first exemplary embodiment also apply here and<br>
the same reference symbols are used.<br>
The carrier body 28 is designed in the same way as the carrier<br>
body of the second exemplary embodiment, although in this case<br>
the pressure duct 29, running parallel to the plugging<br>
direction, issues into the reception orifice 11 without a bend.<br>
Instead of the chip 5, in this case, a chip 30 suitable for<br>
absolute pressure measurements is used, which is glued to the<br>
bottom of the reception orifice 11. Otherwise, the chip 30 is<br>
contacted and covered with the protective gel 19 in the same<br>
way as the chip 5. Covering in this case takes place such that<br>
the pressure duct 29 issues into the reception orifice between<br>
the cover 20 and the surface of the protective gel.<br>
The cover 20 is in this case connected, pressure-tight, to the<br>
carrier body 28, in order to avoid pressure losses through the<br>
gap between the cover 20 and the carrier body 28.<br><br>
This pressure detection device is suitable as an absolute<br>
pressure detection device.<br><br>
A pressure detection device according to a fourth preferred<br>
embodiment in fig. 4 differs from the first exemplary<br>
embodiment in the type of chip. All the other parts of the<br>
device are unchanged, and therefore the explanations regarding<br>
the first exemplary embodiment also apply here and the same<br>
reference symbols are used.<br>
The chip 31 in this case has a vacuum-tight chip cover 32,<br>
fastened in a vacuum-tight manner, above the pressure sensor<br>
element 6, so as to form a reference vacuum cell in which a<br>
reference vacuum prevails.<br>
Absolute pressure detection is thereby possible.<br>
A pressure detection device according to a fifth preferred<br>
embodiment in fig. 5, which shows a sectional plane rotated<br>
through 90° with respect to fig. 1, differs from the first<br>
exemplary embodiment in the use of a temperature sensor 33 and<br>
in the design of the carrier body. All the other parts of the<br>
device are unchanged, and therefore the explanations regarding<br>
the first exemplary embodiment also apply here and the same<br>
reference symbols are used.<br>
The carrier body 34 differs from the carrier body 2 only in<br>
that two further ducts for contact elements 35 are provided, in<br>
which are arranged the contact elements 35 which extend from<br>
the plug connector region as far as the other end of the<br>
carrier body 34. All the other features are unchanged, and the<br>
same reference symbols are used for the unchanged features as<br>
in the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
In the region of the inlet of the pressure duct 9, the<br>
temperature sensor 33 is arranged, which is connected directly<br>
to the contact elements 35. The temperature sensor may, of<br>
course, also lie in or project into the connecting duct 8. This<br>
may also be developed such that the temperature sensor<br><br>
projects out of the connecting duct 8 at least partially from<br>
the base element 1. These variants shorten the response times<br>
for the temperature measurement.<br>
Thus, in parallel with pressure detection, a detection of the<br>
temperature of the fluid whose pressure is detected becomes<br>
possible.<br>
This reception of a temperature sensor is also possible<br>
correspondingly in other exemplary embodiments.<br>
In further exemplary embodiments, instead of the chip or chips,<br>
a circuit board with the evaluation electronics and a pressure<br>
sensor element are provided, and are held and contacted in the<br>
exemplary embodiments described in the same way as the chip.<br><br>
