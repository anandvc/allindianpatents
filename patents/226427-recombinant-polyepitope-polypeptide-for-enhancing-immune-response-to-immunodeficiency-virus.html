				<td>RECOMBINANT POLYEPITOPE POLYPEPTIDE FOR ENHANCING<br>
IMMUNE RESPONSE TO IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS<br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/458,880<br>
filed March 28,2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT<br>
This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of<br>
the United States Government. Therefore, the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention,<br>
FIELD<br>
This disclosure relates to compositions for induction of immune responses in vertebrates.<br>
More particularly, it relates to highly effective, broad spectrum multivalent constructs, both protein<br>
and nucleic acid, for inducing an immune response to an immunodeficiency virus, such as HIV-1.<br>
The disclosure further relates to vaccines comprising immunogenic compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Vertebrates have developed a sophisticated system to project themselves against a wide<br>
variety of hazards including various viruses and microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, as well<br>
as genetic diseases, neoplasia, and effects of a variety of toxins. The system has evolved based on the<br>
ability to recognize self as distinct from non-self or "foreign." A broad panoply of defense<br>
mechanisms are involved, including phagocytosis, lysis, such as complement mediated or perforin<br>
mediated lysis, and killer cells, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs; also known as<br>
cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells, Tc/s), natural killer cells, antibody dependent cytotoxic cells, and the<br>
like. Various cell types offer different mechanisms whereby the invader or endogenous diseased cell<br>
may be eliminated.<br>
A key to the immune defensive mechanism is the T-cell. For instance, it is well known that<br>
the adaptive immune system shows a much stronger response on second, as compared to first,<br>
encounter with an antigen. This phenomenon is exploited in vaccination, which works by inducing a<br>
state of lasting immunity known as immunological memory. Immunological memory requires<br>
activation of T-Iymphocytes specific for the vaccine antigen.<br>
T-cells have been found to be "restricted" in that they respond to an antigen in relation to<br>
one or a few specific molecules (now called major histocompatibility or MHC molecules) associated<br>
with their natural host. In vitro, T-cells from a host of one haplotype respond to an antigen in relation<br>
to an MHC molecule of a different haplotype host The T-cell receptor recognition repertoire appears<br>
to be narrower than the recognition repertoire of immunoglobulins produced by B-cells. In addition,<br>
rather than directly binding to an antigen as do antibodies and other immunoglobulins., the T-cell<br>
receptor appears to require concomitant binding to a foreign antigen and an MHC molecule.<br><br>
MHC molecules are divided into two classes, Class I and Class II. The former class is<br>
relatively ubiquitous on vertebrate cells, while the latter is generally limited to lymphocytes,<br>
macrophages, and dendritic cells. Functionally different T-cells appear to be activated in relation to<br>
one or the other class of MHC molecules. The nature of the activity of a T-cell varies with the Class<br>
of the MHC molecule to which it is complementary. A T-cell clone recognizes a specific antigen in<br>
conjunction with a specific MHC allele. Furthermore, variation in the antigen structure affects the<br>
nature of the response when the T-cell, antigen, and antigen presenting cell are brought together.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the structural change, three possibilities are encountered: no change,<br>
increased stimulation or decreased stimulation of an immune response to the antigen.<br>
T-lymphocytes detect foreign polypeptide antigens by recognizing - via the T-cell receptor<br>
("TCR") - peptide fragments derived from the antigen. Most T-lymphocytes, however, are MHC<br>
restricted, that is, they recognize only complexes of peptides bound to the highly polymorphic<br>
membrane proteins encoded by Class I and Class II MHC genes and presented (displayed) on the<br>
surface of an accessory cell (designated an antigen-presenting cell or "APC"), in which the antigen<br>
has been processed.<br>
Antigens can be processed by one of two pathways, depending on their origin, inside or<br>
outside the APC. In a first pathway, foreign material from outside a cell is engulfed by a specialized<br>
APC (often a macrophage or B-cell), which breaks down the material and complexes the processed<br>
antigen with Class II MHC molecules. In particular, MHC Class II molecules are synthesized in the<br>
endoplasmic reticulum with their antigenic peptide binding sites blocked by the invariant chain<br>
protein (Ii). These MHC Class II-Ii protein complexes are transported from the endoplasmic<br>
reticulum to a post-Golgi compartment where Ii is released by proteolysis and a specific antigenic<br>
peptide becomes bound to the MHC Class II molecule.<br>
Class II MHC molecules are expressed primarily on cells involved in initiating and<br>
sustaining immune responses, such as T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and macrophages. Complexes<br>
of Class II MHC molecules and immunogenic peptides are recognized by helper T-lymphocytes (also<br>
known as helper/accessory T-cells, "Th") and induce proliferation of Th lymphocytes. Class II MHC<br>
complexes also stimulate secretion of cytokines by Th cells, resulting in amplification of the immune<br>
response to the particular immunogenic peptide that is displayed. Th1 cells produce interferon- and<br>
other cytokines that stimulate CTLs, while other cytokines produced by Th2 cells help B-cells to<br>
produce antibodies.<br>
A second antigen processing pathway is generally involved with foreign or aberrant proteins<br>
made within cells, such as virus-infected or malignant cells. These proteins are subjected to partial<br>
proteolysis by the proteosome within such cells, so as to form peptide fragments that then associate<br>
with Class I MHC molecules and are transported to the cell surface for presentation to T-cells. Class<br>
I MHC molecules are expressed on almost all nucleated cells, and complexes of Class I MHC<br>
molecules and bound immunogenic peptides are recognized by CTLs, which then destroy the antigen-<br>
bearing cells. CTLs are particularly important in tumor rejection and in fighting viral infections.<br><br>
For a CTL to recognize an antigen in the form of a peptide fragment bound to the MHC<br>
class I molecule, that antigen must normally be endogenously synthesized by the cell and a portion<br>
degraded into small peptide fragments in the cytoplasm. Some of these small peptides translocate<br>
into a pre-Golgi compartment and interact with Class I heavy chains to facilitate proper folding and<br>
association with the subunit ß2 microglobulin. The peptide-MHC Class I complex is then routed to<br>
the cell surface for expression and potential recognition by specific CTLs.<br>
By these dual antigen processing pathways, appropriate defenses are generated against both<br>
exogenous and internally produced antigens. Thus, antigens taken up from the extracellular<br>
environment eventually elicit B-cells to produce antibodies that protect the organism against a<br>
subsequent challenge by an agent comprising the exogenous antigen. On the other hand, antigens<br>
comprised of abnormal structures made within an abnormal or errant cell (for example a virus-<br>
infected or malignant cell) activate an immune response that eventually leads to killing of the errant<br>
cell. There is considerable interest in methods for better stimulating immune responses to antigens<br>
that are processed by either of these two pathways and presented by either MHC Class I or Class n<br>
molecules.<br>
In view of the above knowledge, it is understandable that there has been substantial interest<br>
in using short peptides to affect an immune response in vivo and in vitro, to provide stimulation or<br>
inactivation of a particular response. Thus, appropriate immunogenic peptides might modulate a<br>
natural immune response to a particular event, either by activating particular lymphocytes to enhance<br>
a protective response or by deactivating particular lymphocytes to diminish or prevent an undesirable<br>
response.<br>
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, also referred to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-<br>
III/LAV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related<br>
disorders (see, for example, Barre-Sinoussi et al, Science 220:868-871,1983; Gallo et al, Science<br>
224:500-503,1984; Levy et al, Science 225:840-842,1984; Siegal et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 305:1439-<br>
1444,1981). AIDS patients usually have a long asymptomatic period followed by the progressive<br>
degeneration of the immune system and the central nervous system. Replication of the virus is highly<br>
regulated, and both latent and lytic infection of the CD4 positive helper subset of T-lymphocytes<br>
occur in tissue culture (Zagury et al, Science 231:850-853,1986). Molecular studies of HTV-1 show<br>
that it encodes a number of genes (Ratner et al, Nature 313:277-284,1985; Sanchez-Pescador et al,<br>
Science 227:484-492,1985), including three structural genes - gag, pol and env - that are common to<br>
all retroviruses. Nucleotide sequences from viral genomes of other retroviruses, particularly HIV-2<br>
and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV; previously referred to as STLV-III), also contain these<br>
structural genes (Guyader et al, Nature 326:662-669,1987; Chakrabarti et al., Nature 328:543-547,<br>
1987).<br>
Development of an effective HIV vaccine is a major challenge due to antigenic variation and<br>
immune escape mechanisms. Strategies that include the use of recombinant DHA technology and<br>
novel antigen delivery methods are being applied to the development of HTV vaccines. Most HTV-1<br><br>
vaccine constructs (DNA and recombinant protein vaccine) are subtype-specific and designed to<br>
prime only one arm of the immune system, that is, CTL responses or humoral B-cell responses.<br>
Emerging data suggest that broadly reactive T-cell responses, as well as neutralizing antibody<br>
responses are likely to be required for an effective immune response against HIV-1. Additionally,<br>
current human phase III vaccine trials using recombinant envelope proteins, suggest that immunity to<br>
HIV-l envelope proteins is probably not sufficient for complete protection against HIV-1. Thus the<br>
results from multiple studies suggest mat additional epitopes as well as activation of both arms of the<br>
immune system may be required for an effective HIV-1 vaccine.<br>
By way of one example of peptide immunogens, Peter et al. (Vaccine 19:4121-4129,2001)<br>
disclose induction of a CTL response against multiple CTL epitopes present in HIV proteins using<br>
short synthetic peptides. Four HLA-A2.1 restricted peptides (RT 476-484, pl7 77-85, gp41 814-823,<br>
RT 956-964) that showed stable binding to the HLA-A2.1 molecule in an in vitro binding assay were<br>
able to elicit a strong specific immune response in HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice when injected with a<br>
peptide ("P30") used as a universal T-cell helper epitope, in incomplete Freund adjuvant (IFA) or a<br>
nonionic emulsifier (Montanide™ ISA 720). The use of biodegradable poly-L-glutamic acid (PLGA)<br>
microspheres (MS) as adjuvant was also successfully tested for all peptides.<br>
Many studies of cross-clade recognition of HIV epitopes have been carried out (see, for<br>
example, Wilson et al, AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 14:925-937,1998; McAdam et al, AIDS<br>
12:571-579,1998; Lynched al., JInfectDis. 178:1040-1046,1998; Boyer et al. Dev. Biol Stand.<br>
95:147-53,1998; Cao et al, J. Virol 71:8615-8623, 1997; Durali etal, Virol 72:3547 3553, 1998).<br>
These studies often used whole-gene, vaccinia-expressed constructs to probe CTL lines from HTV-l<br>
infected or HIV-1 vaccinated volunteers for CTL responses. What appeared to be cross-clade<br>
recognition by CTLs in these experiments may have been recognition of CTL epitopes that are<br>
conserved within the large gene constructs cloned into the vaccinia constructs and into the vaccine<br>
strain (or the autologous strain). Where responses to specific peptides, and their altered sequences in<br>
other HIV strains, have been tested, and the peptides have been mapped, some studies have shown a<br>
lack of cross-strain recognition (Dorrel et al, HIV Vaccine Development Opportunities And<br>
Challenges Meeting, Abstract 109 (Keystone, Colo., January 1999)). Studies of virus escape from<br>
CTL recognition carried out on HTV-l infected individuals have also shown that viral variation at the<br>
amino acid level may abrogate effective CTL responses (Koup, J. Exp. Med. 180:779-782,1994; Dai<br>
etal, J. Virol. 66:3151-3154,1992; Johnson etal, J. Exp. Med. 175:961-971, 1992).<br>
Unfortunately, existing candidate HIV-l vaccines are subtype specific, and are expected not<br>
protect against diverse natural HIV-l infections. This is true of both DNA vaccine constructs as well<br>
as recombinant protein vaccines. Furthermore, many of the existing constructs have focused on<br>
priming only one arm of the immune system, that is, cell mediated T-cell responses or humoral B-cell<br>
responses. In addition, while some DNA constructs have shown promising results in lowering<br>
viremia in animal model systems, none has been able to confer sterilizing immunity. These data<br>
suggest that both B-cell and T-cell responses may be needed for a protective immune response<br><br>
against HIV-1. Additionally, current human phase 3 vaccine trials using recombinant envelope<br>
proteins, suggests that immunity to HIV-1 envelope proteins is probably not sufficient for complete<br>
protection against HIV-1. Prime-boost strategy using recombinant envelope from HIV-l subtype B<br>
also has not been successful in boosting the immune responses.<br>
As the HIV epidemic continues to spread world wide, the need for effective immune-<br>
stimulatory compositions and vaccines remains urgent<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
Multi-clade multivalent (MCMV) (polyepitope; multi-epitope) polypeptides and mixtures of<br>
polypeptides have been developed, which can be used to stimulate immune responses to HIV-1 in<br>
vertebrates. In various embodiments, these polypeptides and polypeptide mixtures include<br>
immunogenic CTL, T- and/or B-cell determinants that are capable of eliciting broad and effective<br>
immune responses against diverse subtypes of HTV-1. Immunogens described herein are designed to<br>
be subtype-independent and will provide both prime and boost reagents for worldwide use.<br>
Also described herein are recombinant MCMV constructs that can be used directly or<br>
indirectly to protect subjects against infection by multiple HIV-l subtypes. These constructs are<br>
designed to elicit T-cell, B-cell, or both T-cell and B-cell responses against highly conserved epitopes<br>
within multiple HIV-1 subtypes. The constructs, when integrated into a vector, can. be used as<br>
immunogens, can be used as DNA vaccines, and can be used as sources of recombinant protein for<br>
stimulation of immune responses in subjects, as well as for protein boosts to subjects who have<br>
received a nucleic acid construct previously.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the MCMV HTV-1 constructs and<br>
polypeptides provide universal immune stimulants and vaccines, capable of effective use in any part<br>
of the world affected by the HIV-1 epidemic.<br>
The construction and design of specific provided constructs are particularly useful in that<br>
they allow convenient addition/deletion of epitopes, and contain specific cellular targeting domains<br>
that optimize antigen processing and recognition.<br>
The provided constructs and proteins encoded thereby also can be combined with oiher<br>
epitope-based constructs to generate, for instance, multi-pathogen vaccines.<br>
The foregoing and other features and advantages will become more apparent from the<br>
following detailed description of several embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 is a series of schematic drawings of embodiments of specific multi-clade,<br>
multivalent gene constructs.<br>
FIG 1A shows one embodiment of a CTL-stimulating MCMV (MCMV-CTL) construct.<br>
Epitopes were chosen based on prior responses of HIV+ individuals, predicted HLA binding and<br><br>
sequence conservation among multiple HIV subtypes. In the Examples provided below, such a gene<br>
construct was assembled using synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides (100-130 mers) that contain<br>
strings of 3-6 CTL epitopes and linker amino acid sequences (exemplified by the tri-amino acid<br>
KAA), which were included to improve processing of epitopes. A modified human ubiquitin peptide<br>
is optionally added to the amino terminus of the molecule to further increase CTL epitope processing.<br>
FIG IB shows one embodiment of a MCMV-AB/Th construct. Antibody and T-helper<br>
epitopes conserved among multiple subtypes of HIV-1 were chosen and single stranded oligos (100-<br>
120 mers) for these epitopes were synthesized. The lysosomal integral membrane protein-II (LIMP-<br>
II) signal sequence is optionally included to enhance processing of T-helper epitopes.<br>
FIG 1C is a schematic illustration of a MCMV-CTL, illustrating that the same nucleic acid<br>
construct can be used to generate both ubiquitin+ and ubiquitin- sequences by differential placement<br>
of the forward primer used to amplify the sequence.<br>
FIG ID shows an alternative embodiment, in which both the CTL and the AB/Th epitopes<br>
are provided in the same recombinant construct In a combined construct such as this, the order of<br>
the different epitope sets can be rearranged.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of the assembly of representative MCMV construct. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment (FIG 2A), overlapping single stranded oligonucleotides (100-130 mers),<br>
spanning the full length of the MCMV-CTL-ubiquitin construct (1.5 kb) were synthesized (eight<br>
forward and eight reverse). Through a series of splicing overlap extension (SOE), polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) and cloning steps, a 1,553 base pair recombinant nucleic acid sequence was generated<br>
and then cloned into pVax-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (FIG 2B). Alternatively, the construct was<br>
also assembled without including ubiquitin (FIG 2C).<br>
Figure 3 is an schematic drawing of vector PTriex-4 (Novagen, Madison, WI), which<br>
contains a representative MCMV-CTL construct, which can be used for production of recombinant<br>
protein in either bacterial, mammalian or insect cells.<br>
Figure 4 is a western blot analysis showing expression of a MCMV-CTL-ubiquitin<br>
polypeptide fusion construct in E. coli. The fusion protein is predicted to be 64 kDa (57 kDa plus the<br>
7 kDa expression tag); expressed protein is indicated in the right hand most lane.<br>
Figure 5 is a western blot analysis of extract from HeLa cells transfected with pVax-1<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing the MCMV-CTL-ubiquitin sequence, using an anti-ubiquitin<br>
antibody for detection. Cells were transfected using various concentrations of GeneJuice reagent<br>
(Merck Biosciences, San Diego, CA) with 1 g of DNA. Cells were harvested 24 and 48 hours post<br>
transfection. A ubiquitinated protein of the correct predicted molecular weight (~56 kDa) of the<br>
synthetic MCMV-CTL-ubiquitin construct is clearly visible, as is normal cellular ubiquitin (-10<br>
kDa).<br>
Figure 6 is a series of bar graphs demonstrating breadth and magnitude of CTL responses<br>
observed to peptides contained in the MCMV-CTL construct with peripheral blood mononuclear cells<br><br>
(PBMCs) from individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 subtype B. The responses are reported as<br>
spot forming cells per 105 PBMCs.<br>
Figure 7 is a bar graph demonstrating percentage predicted epitope recognition based on<br>
subject HLA type. The percentage of predicted epitopes that were targeted by patients' CD8+ cells in<br>
the Elispot assay is shown.<br>

II.	Terms<br>
Unless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage.<br>
Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, Genes VII,<br>
published by Oxford University Press, 2000 (ISBN 019879276X); Kendrew et al. (eds.), The<br>
Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology, published by Blackwell Publishers, 1994 (ISBN 0632021829);<br>
and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: a Comprehensive Desk<br>
Reference, published by Wiley, John &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 0471186341); and other similar<br>
references.<br>
In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of the invention, the following<br>
explanations of specific terms are provided:<br>
Adjuvant: A substance that non-specifically enhances the immune response to an antigen.<br>
Development of vaccine adjuvants for use in humans is reviewed in Singh et al., Nat. Biotechnol.<br>
17:1075-1081,1999, which discloses that, at the time of its publication, aluminum salts and the<br>
MF59 microemulsion are the only vaccine adjuvants approved for human use.<br>
Binding or stable binding (of an oligonucleotide): An oligonucleotide binds or stably<br>
binds to a target nucleic acid if a sufficient amount of the oligonucleotide forms base pairs or is<br>
hybridized to its target nucleic acid, to permit detection of that binding. Binding can be detected by<br>
either physical or functional properties of the target:oligonucleotide complex. Binding between a<br>
target and an oligonucleotide can be detected by any procedure known to one skilled in the art,<br>
including both functional and physical binding assays. Binding may be detected functionally by<br>
determining whether binding has an observable effect upon a biosynthetic process such as expression<br>
of a gene, DNA replication, transcription, translation and the like.<br>
Physical methods of detecting the binding of complementary strands of DNA or RNA are<br>
well known in the art, and include such methods as DNase I or chemical footprinting, gel shift and<br><br>
affinity cleavage assays, Northern blotting, dot blotting and light absorption detection procedures.<br>
For example, one method that is widely used, because it is so simple and reliable., involves observing<br>
a change in light absorption of a solution containing an oligonucleotide (or an analog) and a target<br>
nucleic acid at 220 to 300 nm as the temperature is slowly increased. If the oligonucleotide or analog<br>
has bound to its target, there is a sudden increase in absorption at a characteristic temperature as the<br>
oligonucleotide (or analog) and target disassociate from each other, or melt<br>
The binding between an oligomer and its target nucleic acid is frequently characterized by<br>
the temperature (Tm) at which 50% of the oligomer is melted from its target. A higher (Tm) means a<br>
stronger or more stable complex relative to a complex with a lower (Tm).<br>
Complementarity and percentage complementarity: Molecules with complementary<br>
nucleic acids form a stable duplex or triplex when the strands bind, (hybridize), to each other by<br>
forming Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen base pairs. Stable binding occurs when an<br>
oligonucleotide remains detectably bound to a target nucleic acid sequence under the required<br>
conditions.<br>
Complementarity is the degree to which bases in one nucleic acid strand base pair with the<br>
bases in a second nucleic acid strand. Complementarity is conveniently described by percentage, that<br>
is, the proportion of nucleotides that form base pairs between two strands or within a specific region<br>
or domain of two strands. For example, if 10 nucleotides of a 15-nucleotide oligonucleotide form<br>
base pairs with a targeted region of a DNA molecule, that oligonucleotide is said to have 66.67%<br>
complementarity to the region of DNA targeted.<br>
A thorough treatment of the qualitative and quantitative considerations involved in<br>
establishing binding conditions that allow one skilled in the art to design appropriate oligonucleotides<br>
for use under the desired conditions is provided by Beltz et al., Methods Enzymol 100:266-285,<br>
1983, and by Sambrook et al. (ed), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., vol. 1-3,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989.<br>
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): DNA is a long chain polymer which comprises the genetic<br>
material of most living organisms (some viruses have genes comprising ribonucleic acid (RNA)).<br>
The repeating units in DNA polymers are four different nucleotides, each of which comprises one of<br>
the four bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine bound to a deoxyribose sugar to which a<br>
phosphate group is attached. Triplets of nucleotides (referred to as codons) code for each amino acid<br>
in a polypeptide, or for a stop signal. The term codon is also used for the corresponding (and<br>
complementary) sequences of three nucleotides in the mRNA into which the DNA sequence is<br>
transcribed.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a DNA molecule is intended to include the<br>
reverse complement of that DNA molecule. Except where single-strandedness is required by the text<br>
herein, DNA molecules, though written to depict only a single strand, encompass both strands of a<br>
double-stranded DNA molecule. Thus, a reference to the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a<br>
particular MCMV construct, or a fragment thereof, encompasses both the sense strand and its reverse<br><br>
complement. Thus, for instance, It is appropriate to generate probes or primers from the reverse<br>
complement sequence of the disclosed nucleic acid molecules.<br>
Deletion: The removal of a sequence of DNA, the regions on either side of the removed<br>
sequence being joined together. Similar, this term can refer to the removal (for example, though<br>
genetic engineering means) of an amino acid sequence within a protein, the regions on either side of<br>
the removed sequence being joined together.<br>
Epitope tags : Short stretches of amino acids to which a specific antibody can be raised,<br>
which in some embodiments allows one to specifically identify and track the tagged protein that has<br>
been added (for instance) to a living organism or to cultured cells. Detection of the tagged molecule<br>
can be achieved using a number of well known techniques. Examples of such techniques include (but<br>
are not limited to): immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry,<br>
immunofluorescence microscopy, ELISA, immunoblotting ("western" blotting), and affinity<br>
chromatography. Examples of well known epitope tags include FLAG, T7, HA (hemagglutinin) and<br>
myc. The FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) is beneficially used in some embodiments because high quality<br>
reagents are available to be used for its detection.<br>
Hybridization: Oligonucleotides and their analogs hybridize by hydrogen bonding, which<br>
includes Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between<br>
complementary bases. Generally, nucleic acid consists of nitrogenous bases that are either<br>
pyrimidines (cytosine (C), uracil (U), and thymine (T)) or purines (adenine (A) and guanine (G)).<br>
These nitrogenous bases form hydrogen bonds between a pyrimidine and a purine, and the bonding of<br>
the pyrimidine to the purine is referred to as "base pairing." More specifically, A will hydrogen bond<br>
to T or U, and G will bond to C. "Complementary" refers to the base pairing that occurs between to<br>
distinct nucleic acid sequences or two distinct regions of the same nucleic acid sequence.<br>
"Specifically hybridizable" and "specifically complementary" are terms that indicate a<br>
sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the<br>
oligonucleotide (or its analog) and the DNA or RNA target. The oligonucleotide or oligonucleotide<br>
analog need not be 100% complementary to its target sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An<br>
oligonucleotide or analog is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide or analog<br>
to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA,<br>
and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the<br>
oligonucleotide or analog to non-target sequences under conditions where specific binding is desired,<br>
for example under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or systems. Such binding is<br>
referred to as specific hybridization.<br>
Hybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary depending<br>
upon the nature of the hybridization method of choice and the composition and length of the<br>
hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally, the temperature of hybridization and the ionic<br>
strength (especially the Na+ concentration) of the hybridization buffer will determine the stringency<br>
of hybridization, though wash times also influence stringency. Calculations regarding hybridization<br><br>
conditions required for attaining particular degrees of stringency are discussed by Sambrook et al.<br>
(ed.), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989, chapters 9 and 11, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, "stringent conditions" encompass conditions under<br>
which hybridization will only occur if there is less than 25% mismatch between the hybridization<br>
molecule and the target sequence. "Stringent conditions" may be broken down into particular levels<br>
of stringency for more precise definition. Thus, as used herein, "moderate stringency" conditions are<br>
those under which molecules with more than 25% sequence mismatch will not hybridize; conditions<br>
of "medium stringency" are those under which molecules with more than 15% mismatch will not<br>
hybridize, and conditions of "high stringency" are those under which sequences with more than 10%<br>
mismatch will not hybridize. Conditions of "very high stringency" are those under which sequences<br>
with more than 6% mismatch will not hybridize.<br>
Isolated: An "isolated" biological component (such as a nucleic acid molecule, protein or<br>
organelle) has been substantially separated or purified away from other biological components in the<br>
cell of the organism in which the component naturally occurs, that is, other chromosomal and extra-<br>
chromosomal DNA and RNA, proteins and organelles. Nucleic acids and proteins that have been<br>
"isolated" include nucleic acids and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term<br>
also embraces nucleic acids and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as<br>
chemically synthesized nucleic acids.<br>
Lysosomal compartment: Membrane-bound acidic vacuoles containing lysosomal-<br>
associated membrane protein (LAMP) molecules in the membrane, hydrolytic enzymes that function<br>
in antigen processing, and MHC class II molecules for antigen recognition and presentation. This<br>
compartment functions as a site for degradation of foreign materials internalized from the cell surface<br>
by any of a variety of mechanisms including endocytosis, phagocytosis and pinocytosis, and of<br>
intracellular material delivered to this compartment by specialized autolytic phenomena (de Duve,<br>
Eur. J. Biochem. 137:391,1983).<br>
The biosynthesis and vacuolar targeting mechanisms of the hydrolytic enzymes present in<br>
the lysosomal compartment have been extensively studied (Kornfeld &amp; Mellman, Ann. Rev. Cell<br>
Biol., 5:483,1989). Newly synthesized hydrolases in the Golgi apparatus acquire mannose 6-<br>
phosphate groups that serve as specific recognition markers for the binding of these enzymes to<br>
mannose 6-phosphate receptors which are then targeted in some unknown manner to a prelysosomal<br>
vacuole. There the receptor-enzyme complex is dissociated by low pH, and the receptors recycle to<br>
the Golgi apparatus, while the enzyme-containing vacuole matures into a lysosome.<br>
Studies of the structure and function of the lysosomal membrane were initiated in 1981 by<br>
August and colleagues with the discovery of major cellular glycoproteins that were subsequently<br>
termed LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 due to their predominant localization in the lysosomal membrane.<br>
Analogous proteins were subsequently identified in rat, chicken and human cells. Typically, LAMP-<br>
1, as deduced from a cDNA clone (Chen et al, J. Biol. Chem., 263:8754, 1988) consists of a<br><br>
polypeptide core of about 382 amino acids (~42,000 Da) with a large (346-residue) intraluminal<br>
amino-terminal domain followed by a 24-residue hydrophobic transmembrane region and short (12-<br>
residue) carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The intraluminal domain is highly glycosylated, being<br>
substituted with about 20 asparagine linked complex-type oligosaccharides and consists of two -160-<br>
residue homology units that are separated by a proline/serine-rich region. Each of these homologous<br>
domains contains four uniformly spaced cysteine residues, disulfide bonded to form four 36-38-<br>
residue loops symmetrically placed within the two halves of the intraluminal domain (Arterburn et<br>
al, J. Biol. Chem., 265:7419,1990). The LAMP-2 molecule is highly similar to LAMP-1 in overall<br>
amino acid sequence (Cha et al, J. Biol. Chem., 265:5008, 1990).<br>
Another glycoprotein, described as CD63, MEA491 orLIMP-I, is also found in lysosomal<br>
membranes, as well as other in vacuolar structures (Azorza et al., Blood, 78:280, 1991). This<br>
molecule is distinctly different from the LAMPs, with a core polypeptide of about 25,000 Da and four<br>
transmembrane domains, but it has a cytoplasmic structure and sequence similar to the LAMP<br>
molecules. There is also extensive amino acid sequence similarity between this protein and a family<br>
of other molecules that also contain four membrane spanning domains, including the Schistosoma<br>
mansoni membrane protein SM23, CD37, the tumor-associated antigen CO-029, and the target of<br>
antiproliferative antibody-1.<br>
LIMP-II is an additional glycoprotein present in the membrane of lysosomes and secretory<br>
granules with lysosomal properties (Vega et al, J.Biol. Chem., 266:16818, 1991). A sequence near<br>
the amino-terminus with properties of an uncleavable signal peptide and a hydrophobic amine acid<br>
segment near the carboxyl end suggest that the protein is anchored in cell membranes at two sites by<br>
two short cytoplasmic tails at the amine and carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein. The molecule<br>
does not have sequence homology to any of the other described lysosomal membrane protein, but is<br>
highly similar to the cell surface protein CD36, which is involved in cell adhesion.<br>
Nucleotide: This term includes, but is not limited to, a monomer that includes a base linked<br>
to a sugar, such as a pyrimidine, purine or synthetic analogs thereof, or a base linked to an amino<br>
acid, as in a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). A nucleotide is one monomer in a polynucleotide. A<br>
nucleotide sequence refers to the sequence of bases in a polynucleotide.<br>
Oligonucleotide: An oligonucleotide is a plurality of joined nucleotides joined by native<br>
phosphodiester bonds, between about 6 and about 300 nucleotides in length. An oligonucleotide<br>
analog refers to moieties that function similarly to oligonucleotides but have non-naturally occurring<br>
portions. For example, oligonucleotide analogs can contain non-naturally occurring portions, such as<br>
altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages, such as a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide.<br>
Functional analogs of naturally occurring polynucleotides can bind to RNA or DNA, and include<br>
PNA molecules.<br>
Particular oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs can include linear sequences up to<br>
about 200 nucleotides in length, for example a sequence (such as DNA or RNA) that is at least 6<br><br>
bases, for example at least 8, 10, 15,20,25, 30, 35,40,45, 50, 100 or even 200 bases long, or from<br>
about 6 to about 50 bases, for example about 10-25 bases, such as 12, 15 or 20 bases.<br>
Operably linked: A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic<br>
acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the<br>
second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the<br>
promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably linked<br>
DNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same<br>
reading frame.<br>
Open reading frame: A series of nucleotide triplets (codons) coding for amino acids<br>
without any internal termination codons. These sequences are usually translatable into a<br>
peptide/polypeptide/protein.<br>
Parenteral: Administered outside of the intestine, for example, not via the alimentary tract.<br>
Generally, parenteral formulations are those that will be administered through any possible mode<br>
except ingestion. This term especially refers to injections, whether administered intravenously,<br>
intrathecally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously, and various surface applications<br>
including intranasal, intradermal, and topical application, for instance.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful<br>
with compositions described herein are conventional. Martin, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,<br>
published by Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 19th Edition, 1995, describes compositions and<br>
formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the nucleotides and proteins herein disclosed.<br>
In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration<br>
being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include<br>
pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced<br>
salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for<br>
example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for<br>
example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to<br>
biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor<br>
amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and<br>
pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.<br>
Probes and primers: A probe comprises an isolated nucleic acid attached to a detectable<br>
label or other reporter molecule. Typical labels include radioactive isotopes, enzyme substrates, co-<br>
factors, ligands, chemiluminescent or fluorescent agents, haptens, and enzymes. Methods for<br>
labeling and guidance in the choice of labels appropriate for various purposes are discussed, for<br>
example, in Sambrook et al. (ed.), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., vol. 1-3, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989 and Ausubel et al. Short Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, 4"' ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999.<br>
Primers are short nucleic acid molecules, for instance DNA oligonucleotides 10 nucleotides<br>
or more in length, for example that hybridize to contiguous complementary nucleotides or a sequence<br><br>
to be amplified. Longer DNA oligonucleotides may be about 15,20, 25,30 or 50 nucleotides or<br>
more in length. Primers can be annealed to a complementary target DNA strand by nucleic acid<br>
hybridization to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand, and then the primer<br>
extended along the target DNA strand by a DNA polymerase enzyme. Primer pairs can be used for<br>
amplification of a nucleic acid sequence, for example, by the PCR or other nucleic-acid amplification<br>
methods known in the art. Other examples of amplification include strand displacement<br>
amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,744,311; transcription-free isothermal amplification,<br>
as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,033,881; repair chain reaction amplification, as disclosed in WO<br>
90/01069; ligase chain reaction amplification, as disclosed in EP-A-320 308; gap filling ligase chain<br>
reaction amplification, as disclosed in 5,427,930; and NASBA™ RNA transcription-free<br>
amplification, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,025,134.<br>
Methods for preparing and using nucleic acid probes and primers are described, for example,<br>
in Sambrook et al. (ed.), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989; Ausubel et al. Short Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999; and Innis et al. PCR Protocols, A Guide<br>
to Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA, 1990. Amplification primer<br>
pairs can be derived from a known sequence, for example, by using computer programs intended for<br>
that purpose such as Primer (Version 0.5, © 1991, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research,<br>
Cambridge, MA). One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the specificity of a particular<br>
probe or primer increases with its length. Thus, in order to obtain greater specificity, probes and<br>
primers can be selected that comprise at least 20,25,30,35,40,45,50 or more consecutive<br>
nucleotides of a target nucleotide sequences.<br>
Protein: A biological molecule, particularly a polypeptide, expressed by a gene and<br>
comprised of amino acids.<br>
Purified: The term "purified" does not require absolute purity (for example, the absence of<br>
all other substances); rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, a purified protein<br>
preparation is one in which the protein referred to is more pure than the protein in its natural<br>
environment within a cell or within a production reaction chamber (as appropriate).<br>
Recombinant: A recombinant nucleic acid is one that has a sequence that is not naturally<br>
occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated<br>
segments of sequence. This artificial combination can be accomplished by chemical synthesis or,<br>
more commonly, by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, for example, by<br>
genetic engineering techniques.<br>
Specific binding agent: An agent that binds substantially only to a defined target. Thus a<br>
protein-specific binding agent binds substantially only the defined protein, or to a specific region<br>
within the protein. As used herein, a protein-specific binding agent includes antibodies and other<br>
agents that bind substantially to a specified polypeptide. The antibodies may be monoclonal or<br><br>
polyclonal antibodies that are specific for the polypeptide, as well as immunologically effective<br>
portions ("fragments") thereof.<br>
Antibodies may be produced using standard procedures described in a number of texts,<br>
including Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSHL, New York, 1999. The<br>
determination that a particular agent binds substantially only to the target protein may readily be<br>
made by using or adapting routine procedures. One suitable in vitro assay makes use of the Western<br>
blotting procedure (described in many standard texts, including Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies:<br>
A Laboratory Manual, CSHL, New York, 1999). Western blotting may be used to determine that a<br>
given target protein binding agent, such as a monoclonal antibody, binds substantially only to the<br>
specified target protein.<br>
Shorter fragments of antibodies can also serve as specific binding agents. For instance,<br>
Fabs, Fvs, and single-chain Fvs (SCFvs) that bind to target protein (or epitope within a protein or<br>
fusion protein) would also be specific binding agents for that protein (or epitope). These antibody<br>
fragments are defined as follows: (1) FAb, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-<br>
binding fragment of an antibody molecule produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme<br>
papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain; (2) FAb', the fragment of an<br>
antibody molecule obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield<br>
an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain; two FAb' fragments are obtained per antibody<br>
molecule; (3) (FAb')2, the fragment of the antibody obtained by treating whole antibody with the<br>
enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; (4) F(Ab')2, a dimer of two FAb' fragments held<br>
together by two disulfide bonds; (5) Fv, a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable<br>
region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and (6)<br>
single chain antibody ("SCA"), a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of<br>
the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a<br>
genetically fused single chain molecule. Methods of making these fragments are routine.<br>
Subject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes both human<br>
and non-human mammals.<br>
Transformed: A transformed cell is a cell into which has been introduced a nucleic acid<br>
molecule by molecular biology techniques. As used herein, the term transformation encompasses all<br>
techniques by which a nucleic acid molecule might be introduced into such a cell, including<br>
transfection with viral vectors, transformation with plasmid vectors, and introduction of naked DNA<br>
by electroporation, lipofection, and particle gun or other acceleration techniques (for example, air<br>
gun).<br>
Vaccine: A term used herein to mean a composition useful for stimulating a specific<br>
immune response (or immunogenic response) in a vertebrate. In some embodiments, the<br>
immunogenic response is protective or provides protective immunity, in that it enables the vertebrate<br>
animal to better resist infection with or disease progression from the organism against which the<br>
vaccine is directed. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that an immunogenic<br><br>
response may arise from the generation of neutralizing antibodies, T-helper, or cytotoxic cells of the<br>
immune system, or all of the above.<br>
In some embodiments, an "effective amount" or "immune-stimulatory amount" of a vaccine<br>
or vaccinating composition is an amount which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to<br>
engender a detectable immune response. Such a response may comprise, for instance, generation of<br>
an antibody specific to one or more of the epitopes provided in the vaccine. Alternatively, the<br>
response may comprise a T-helper or CTL-based response to one or more of the epitopes provided in<br>
the vaccine. All three of these responses may originate from naive or memory cells. In other<br>
embodiments, a "protective effective amount" of a vaccine or vaccinating composition is an amount<br>
which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to confer protective immunity upon the subject.<br>
Vector: A nucleic acid molecule as introduced into a host cell, thereby producing a<br>
transformed host cell. A vector may include nucleic acid sequences that permit it to replicate in a<br>
host cell, such as an origin of replication. A vector may also include one or more selectable marker<br>
genes and other genetic elements known in the art.<br>
Virus: Microscopic infectious organism that reproduces inside living cells. A virus<br>
typically consists essentially of a core of a single nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat, and has<br>
the ability to replicate only inside a living cell. "Viral replication" is the production of additional<br>
virus by the occurrence of at least one viral life cycle. A virus may subvert the host cells' normal<br>
functions, causing the cell to behave in a manner determined by the virus. For example, a viral<br>
infection may result in a cell producing a cytokine, or responding to a cytokine, when the uninfected<br>
cell does not normally do so.<br>
"Retroviruses" are RNA viruses wherein the viral genome is RNA. When a host cell is<br>
infected with a retrovirus, the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into a DNA intermediate which is<br>
integrated very efficiently into the chromosomal DNA of infected cells. The integrated DNA<br>
intermediate is referred to as a provirus. The term "lentivirus" is used in its conventional sense to<br>
describe a genus of viruses containing reverse transcriptase. The lentiviruses include the<br>
"immunodeficiency viruses" which include human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2, simian<br>
immunodeficiency virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus.<br>
HIV is a retrovirus that causes immunosuppression in humans (HIV disease), and leads to a<br>
disease complex known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. "HIV disease" refers to a<br>
well-recognized constellation of signs and symptoms (including the development of opportunistic<br>
infections) in persons who are infected by an HIV virus, as determined by antibody detection using<br>
ELISA or western blot studies. Alternatively, HIV infection can be detected by the presence of HIV<br>
RNA (for example, using RT-PCR) or HIV integrated DNA (for example, using PCR). Laboratory<br>
findings associated with this disease are a progressive decline in T-helper cells and a rise in viremia<br>
(viral load as determined by, for instance, RT-PCR).<br><br>
Unless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same<br>
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.<br>
The singular terms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless context clearly indicates<br>
otherwise. Similarly, the word "or" is intended to include "and" unless the context clearly indicates<br>
otherwise. Hence "comprising A or B" means including A, or B, or A and B. For example, the term<br>
"a cell" includes a plurality of cells, including mixtures of two or more types of cells. The term "a<br>
nucleic acid molecule" includes a plurality of nucleic acid molecules, or a mixture of different nucleic<br>
acid molecules. Similarly, the same holds for "a protein" or "a polypeptide."<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" shall mean that the compositions and methods<br>
include the recited elements, but do not exclude other elements. "Consisting essentially of shall<br>
mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination. Thus, a composition<br>
consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude trace contaminants from<br>
the isolation and purification method and/or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as phosphate<br>
buffered saline, preservatives, and the like. "Consisting of shall mean excluding more than trace<br>
elements of other ingredients and/or excluding substantial additional method steps. Embodiments<br>
defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope.<br>
It is further to be understood that all base sizes or amino acid sizes, and all molecular weight<br>
or molecular mass values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides, are approximate and are provided<br>
for description. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can<br>
be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are<br>
described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein<br>
are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including<br>
explanations of terms, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative<br>
only and not intended to be limiting.<br>
III. Overview of Several Embodiments<br>
Provided herein in various embodiments are multi-clade, multivalent recombinant<br>
polyepitope polypeptides, which are useful to induce immunogenic responses in vertebrate animals to<br>
HIV-1. These polypeptides include CTL-stimulatory epitopes, T-helper cell stimulatory epitopes, B-<br>
cell stimulatory epitopes, or combinations of two or more such types of epitopes. Epitopes in the<br>
polyepitope polypeptides are selected to provide multi-clade coverage. In particular, epitopes are<br>
selected to be at least 50% conserved across a plurality of HIV-1 subtypes, for instance, at least 2, 3,<br>
4, 5,6, or more HIV-1 subtypes. In particular embodiments, at least 30% of the epitopes included in<br>
a single polyepitope polypeptide are at least 60% conserved, at least 70% conserved, at least 80%<br>
conserved, or even more highly conserved across a plurality of HIV-1 subtypes.<br>
In specific embodiments there are provided isolated polyepitope polypeptides, wherein<br>
adjacent polypeptide segments are linked by a spacer peptide. In some examples, the spacer peptide<br><br>
links multiple groups of polypeptide segments. Specific, non-limiting examples of the spacer peptide<br>
include the tri-amino acid lysine - alanine - alanine, or proline - glycine - proline.<br>
In other examples, the isolated polyepitope polypeptides also include a targeting signal that<br>
targets the polyepitope polypeptides to a lysosome or to a proteosome. Specific, non-limiting,<br>
examples of the targeting signal include a targeting-competent fragment of lysosomal integral<br>
membrane protein-II or ubiquitin.<br>
In still other examples, the isolated polyepitope polypeptides also include a plurality of<br>
amino acid segments from one or more HIV-1 coreceptors. A specific, non-limiting, example of a<br>
HIV-1 coreceptor is CCR5.<br>
In further examples, the isolated polyepitope polypeptides include human cytotoxic T-<br>
lymphocyte stimulatory epitopes, human T-helper cell stimulatory epitopes, human B-cell stimulatory<br>
epitopes, or combinations of two or more epitopes thereof.<br>
In additional embodiments there are provided isolated polyepitope polypeptides, which<br>
polypeptides comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of sequences<br>
provided in SEQ ID NOs: 2,4,5, 6,8 and 10. Also provided are mixtures of two or more isolated<br>
polyepitope polypeptides, including (but not limited to) mixtures of the polypeptides having<br>
sequences as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 8,2 and 10,4 and 8,4 and 10, 5 and 8,5 and 10, 6 and 8,<br>
and 6 and 10.<br>
Other embodiments are isolated polynucleotides (nucleic acid molecules) which encode one<br>
of the polyepitope polypeptides described herein. Specific examples of such nucleic acid molecules<br>
comprise a sequence selected from the group consisting of sequences recited in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3,7,<br>
9 and complements thereof. Other specific examples of nucleic acid molecules are the portions of<br>
each of SEQ ID NOs: 1,3,7, and 9 which correspond to and encode the polyepitope polypeptides<br>
shown in SEQ ED NOs: 2,4, 8, and 10, respectively.<br>
Also provided herein are genetic constructs that comprise at least one nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding a polyepitope polypeptide, and host cells transformed with such a genetic construct.<br>
Yet another embodiment is a composition comprising at least one polyepitope polypeptide<br>
or at least one nucleic acid molecule encoding a polyepitope polypeptide, and at least one component<br>
selected from the group consisting of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants. This<br>
disclosure further provides methods for eliciting and/or enhancing an immune response in a subject,<br>
which methods involve administering to the subject such a composition. In one specific, non-limiting<br>
example, the subject is infected with HIV-1<br>
IV. Multi-Clade, Multivalent HIV-1 Constructs<br>
The current disclosure provides multi-clade multivalent HIV-1 constructs useful for<br>
inducing immune responses in HTV-1-infected populations with diverse HLA alleles and HIV<br>
subtypes.<br><br>
HIV-1 MCMV constructs comprise synthetic nucleic acid sequences to be used as HIV-1<br>
immune-stimulatory and/or vaccine constructs to protect against multiple HIV-1 subtypes. These<br>
synthetic nucleic acid molecules or mixtures of nucleic acid molecules are designed to elicit both T-<br>
cell and B-cell responses against highly conserved epitopes within multiple HIV-1 subtypes. In<br>
 specific embodiments, the synthetic genes are contained in plasmid constructs, which can be used as<br>
a DNA vaccine, as well as a source of recombinant protein for subsequent protein boosts.<br>
Provided herein in various embodiments are multi-clade, multivalent polyepitope<br>
polypeptides, which are useful to induce immunogenic responses in vertebrate animals to HIV-1.<br>
These polypeptides include CTL-stimulatory epitopes, T-helper cell stimulatory epitopes, B-cell<br>
 stimulatory epitopes, or combinations of two or more such types of epitopes. Epitopes in the<br>
polyepitope polypeptides are selected to provide multi-clade coverage. In particular, epitopes are<br>
selected to be at least 50% conserved across a plurality of HIV-1 subtypes, for instance, at least 2,3,<br>
4,5,6, or more HTV-1 subtypes. In particular embodiments, at least 30%of the epitopes included in<br>
a single polyepitope polypeptide are at least 60% conserved, at least 70% conserved, at least 80%<br>
 conserved, or even more highly conserved across a plurality of HIV-1 subtypes.<br>
One aspect of embodiments provided herein is that peptide sequences, each of which<br>
contains one or more antibody-binding or class I or class II MHC-binding epitopes, can be linked in<br>
tandem to form polyepitope polypeptides. These polyepitope polypeptides are proteolytically<br>
processed in cells to release the individual epitopes, and are useful for stimulating an immune<br>
 response in a vertebrate animal.<br>
When a MCMV polyepitope polypeptide is introduced into a cell, it is proteolytically<br>
processed into at least some of its constituent epitopes. At least some of the epitopes generated from<br>
the polypeptide can bind to MHC class I or MHC class II molecules present in the cell, though some<br>
of the epitopes may be specific for MHC class I or class II molecules present only on other cells.<br>
 Included epitopes also may be B-cell epitopes, which elicit antibody-mediated immune responses<br>
upon binding to antibody receptors on the surface of a B-cell.<br>
In one aspect, the disclosure features a nucleic acid encoding a polyepitope polypeptide that<br>
can include, in any order, a first, second, and third segment, each of which is at least nine amino acids<br>
in length. As used herein, a "segment" is an amino acid sequence which (a) corresponds to the<br>
30 sequence of a portion (that is, a fragment, less than all) of a naturally occurring protein, and (b)<br>
contains one or more epitopes. By "epitope" is meant a peptide which binds to the binding groove of<br>
an MHC class I or class II molecule, or to the antigen-binding region of an antibody. In addition, the<br>
polyepitope polypeptide can encode a targeting signal, for instance a peptide sequence that targets the<br>
protein to which it is fused to the lysosome or to the proteosome, as described in more detail herein.<br>
35	In some embodiments, a segment of the polyepitope polypeptide has the amino acid<br>
sequence of a portion of (1) a naturally occurring HIV-1 protein or (2) a naturally occurring<br>
coreceptor (collectively referred to as "naturally occurring proteins"), that is at least nine amino acids<br>
in length. A second segment has the amino acid sequence of a second portion of the same or a<br><br>
different naturally occurring protein, is at least nine amino acids in length, and includes at least one<br>
epitope which is different from the epitope(s) of the first segment. Optionally, a third segment is<br>
included in the polyepitope polypeptide, and has the amino acid sequence of a third portion of the<br>
same or a different naturally occurring protein, is at least nine amino acids in length, and includes at<br>
least one epitope which is different from the epitope(s) of the first and second segments.<br>
Alternatively, the first, second and third portions may be portions of two or three different naturally<br>
occurring proteins (for example, two or three different HTV-1 proteins). The polyepitope polypeptide<br>
may optionally include additional segments, for example, it can include at least 4,5,10,15,20,25,<br>
30,40, 50, 60,75,90 or even 100 or more segments, each being a portion of a naturally-occurring<br>
protein of a pathogenic agent and/or of a naturally occurring coreceptor which can be the same or<br>
different from the protein(s) from which the other segments are derived.<br>
Each of these segments is at least nine amino acids in length, and each contains at least one<br>
epitope different from the epitope(s) of other segments in the polyepitope polypeptide. At least one<br>
(and in some embodiments, more) of the segments in the polyepitope polypeptide may contain class I<br>
or class II MHC-binding epitopes. Two, three, or more of the segments can be contiguous in the<br>
polyepitope polypeptide: that is, they are joined end-to-end, with no spacer between them.<br>
Alternatively, any two adjacent segments can be linked by a spacer amino acid or spacer peptide. In<br>
particular embodiments, the spacer comprises three amino acids. Specific non-limiting examples of<br>
spacers are the tri-amino acid KAA and the tri-amino acid PGP. Additionally, a spacer amino acid or<br>
spacer peptide can be used to link multiple groups of two, three, or more contiguous segments in the<br>
polyepitope polypeptide: that is, a spacer amino acid or spacer peptide is inserted between every two,<br>
three, or more segments.<br>
A given segment of protein within the polyepitope polypeptide need not be any specified<br>
length, so long as it is sufficiently long to generate at least one epitope, for example, 2, 3,4, 5, or<br>
more epitopes, and is at least 9 amino acids in length. For example, a given segment can have a<br>
length of at least 10 amino acids, for example, at least 11,12,13,14,15,20,25,30,40, or 50 amino<br>
acids. A given segment corresponds to a particular naturally occurring protein if any 9 (or more)<br>
consecutive amino acids of the segment are found in exactly the same order in a portion of the<br>
naturally occurring protein. In exemplary embodiments, the segments included in a polyepitope<br>
polypeptide are obtained from one or more HTV-1 proteins and/or coreceptors (for example, CCR5).<br>
It is understood that the term "naturally occurring proteins" used above does not preclude<br>
modification of the sequence used in the polyepitope polypeptide, for instance by changing one or a<br>
few amino acids. In addition, it is understood that the nucleic acid molecule encoding the segment<br>
need not be identical to the "naturally occurring" sequence, as found in (for instance) the HTV-1<br>
genome. In particular, it is contemplated that the codon usage in the nucleic acid molecule can be<br>
modified, for instance to convert the encoding sequence to a codon optimized sequence. The codon<br>
optimization can be tailored for the host cell in which the construct will eventually be expressed.<br>
Thus, some constructs are engineered to be codon biased for expression in a prokaryotic cell, others<br><br>
to be expressed in a unicellular eukaryotic cell, and still others to be expressed in a cell of a<br>
multicellular eukaryote (for example, a vertebrate). Codon selection to take advantage of species<br>
biases is well known to those of ordinary skill.<br>
The discovery of the HIV-l coreceptors, together with, a greater understanding of the<br>
Envelope-receptor mediated conformational changes resulting in the membrane fusion process, has<br>
identified several promising vaccine targets. These epitopes as well as others in the transmembrane<br>
envelope glycoprotein (gp41) have been identified as HIV-l neutralizing epitopes. Likewise,<br>
epitopes in the CCR5 coreceptor have been identified as potential targets for interfering with<br>
receptor-env interactions. Any of these epitopes can be included in the polyepitope polypeptides<br>
described herein.<br>
Construction of HIV-MCMV Immunogens<br>
HIV-1-MCMV immunogen constructs comprised of a string of codon-optimized epitopes<br>
have been produced. The antigenic fragments/epitopes in examples of such constructs were selected<br>
using published studies including broad MHC allele recognition and were compiled from the Los	i<br>
Alamos sequence database. A representative pair of immunogen constructs (polyepitope<br>
polypeptides) contains multiple B-cell epitopes, CTL epitopes, and T-helper epitopes representing<br>
immunodominant regions for all subtypes of HIV-1 (see tables included in the examples, and Figures<br>
1,2, and 3). The epitopes chosen are &gt;80% homologous across diverse HIV-l subtypes. B-cell<br>
epitopes in the virus binding domain of the human HIV coreceptor CCR5 are also included.<br>
Without intending to be limited to a single interpretation, it is believed that antibodies to<br>
CCR5 together with neutralizing antibodies directed against the HIV-l envelope glycoprotein and<br>
strong T-cell immunity will interfere with the viral entry process and is expected to induce sterilizing<br>
immunity.<br>
Example immunogen constructs are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2,4, 5,6,8, and 10. The<br>
constructs shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2,4, 5, and 6 include CTL epitopes (and therefore can be referred<br>
to generally as MCMV-CTL constructs); those in SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 10 include B-cell and T-helper<br>
epitopes (and therefore can be referred to generally as MCMV-AB/Th constructs).<br>
Unique restriction enzyme digestion sites have been included in the nucleic acid constructs<br>
encoding the provided polyepitope polypeptides. These facilitate addition/deletion of epitopes, as<br>
well as the shuttling of the polyepitope cassette between a number of DNA vectors, including DNA<br>
vaccine constructs (for example, pVax-1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), eukaryotic yeast expression<br>
vectors (for example, pYes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and multi-cell type expression vectors (for<br>
example, pTriEX-4, Novagen, Madison, WI). This enables the production of both a DNA based<br>
immunogen and vaccine, and ready production recombinant polyepitope polypeptide, which can be<br>
used directly as an immunogen or as a boost. The synthetic genes (which encode one or more<br>
polyepitope polypeptides) also can be incorporated into attenuated viral vectors such as Modified<br>
Vaccinia or Adenovirus to serve as a boosting agent<br><br>
Delivery and immunogenicity by inclusion of targeting sequences<br>
Recent studies suggest that peptide spacers between epitopes and/or targeting sequences<br>
may increase the immunogenicity of certain epitopes. Targeting sequences such as the LIMP-II<br>
targeting sequence (which directs proteins to lysosomes and enhances class-II recognition), or<br>
targeting-competent fragments thereof, are used in certain provided embodiments to help enhance T-<br>
helper response. Likewise, proteosome targeting sequences (for example, ubiquitin or targeting-<br>
competent fragments thereof) that help induce class I recognition are included in specific<br>
embodiments, to provide improved CTL production. The chosen epitopes were back translated and<br>
human codon optimized for increased expression from the DNA construct.<br>
In any of the described nucleic acids encoding polyepitope polypeptides, a spacer amino<br>
acid or spacer peptide can be included between any two adjacent segments of the construct.<br>
Optionally, in some embodiments the spacer is included between each epitope; in other embodiments,<br>
a spacer is included between every two, every three, every four, every five epitopes, or even less<br>
often. In particular embodiments, the spacer comprises three amino acids. Specific non-limiting<br>
examples of spacers are the tri-amino acid KAA and the tri-amino acid PGP.<br>
Recognition of Epitopes contained in the Constructs<br>
Most vaccine constructs under development are subtype-specific. This has led to<br>
development of a number of country-specific subtype-specific HIV-1 vaccines, however, such<br>
vaccines will be difficult to implement due to emerging diversity and changing epidemic of HIV-1.<br>
In contrast, the constructs provided herein comprise highly conserved immunogenic regions<br>
of HIV-1 that result in cross-protective immune responses across HIV-1 subtypes. The immune<br>
responses to the immunogenic epitopes can be tested, for instance, in recently-infected HIV-1<br>
infected persons (Primary HIV-1 infection; PHI) or individuals that have a slow progression to<br>
disease.<br>
V.	Uses of MCMV Immvnogens<br>
In order to function effectively in vivo as a DNA-based immunogen, it is advantageous to<br>
include within the MCMV nucleic acid construct a control sequence that has the effect of enhancing<br>
or promoting the translation of the sequences encoding the antigens. Use of such promoters is well<br>
known to those of skill in the fields of molecular biology, cell biology, and viral immunology (See,<br>
"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", 2nd Ed., Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, MY, 1989; and "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology",<br>
Ausubel st al,, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1987 (updated quarterly)).<br>
In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid construct is intended for use as a vaccine in a<br>
mammalian host. Therefore it is advantageous to employ a promoter which operates effectively in<br>
mammalian cells. Particular embodiments relate to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells. Many<br><br>
promoter sequences are known that are useful in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells. A<br>
promoter is operably disposed with respect to the sequence(s) whose translation is to be promoted, so<br>
that it is capable of promoting translation. In certain embodiments, the promoter is the<br>
cytomegalovirus early promoter. In addition, in some embodiments, the sequences to be expressed<br>
are followed by a terminator sequence.<br>
Preparation of the nucleic acids is readily accomplished by methods well known to workers<br>
of skill in the field of molecular biology. Procedures involved are set forth, for example, in<br>
Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989, and<br>
"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology", Ausubel et ah, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1987<br>
(updated quarterly). Incorporation of promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus promoter, and of the<br>
polyadenylation signal, is likewise well known to skilled practitioners in molecular biology and<br>
recombinant DNA engineering.<br>
When a nucleic acid molecule harboring a MCMV epitope chain is prepared, it may be<br>
obtained in larger quantities by methods that amplify a nucleic acid fragment. Such methods are<br>
widely known to workers skilled in molecular biology and recombinant DNA engineering. Examples<br>
of these methods include incorporation of the nucleic acid fragment into a plasmid for replication by<br>
culturing in a cell (for example, a prokaryotic cell) and harvesting the plasmid after growth of the<br>
culture, as well as amplification of the nucleic acid fragment by nucleic acid amplification methods,<br>
such as the PCR. These methods are exemplary only, and not intended to limit the ways in which the<br>
nucleic acid construct may be obtained.<br>
The MCMV nucleic acid constructs may be introduced into appropriate host cells in many<br>
ways well known to those of ordinary skill in the fields of molecular biology and viral immunology.<br>
By way of example, these include, but are not limited to, incorporation into a plasmid or similar<br>
nucleic acid vector which is taken up by the host cells, or encapsulation within vesicular lipid<br>
structures such as liposomes, especially liposomes comprising cationic lipids, or adsorption to<br>
particles that are incorporated into the host cell by endocytosis.<br>
In general, a host cell is a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell harboring a MCMV nucleic acid, or<br>
into which such a MCMV molecule has been introduced. The constructs described herein induce the<br>
intracellular biosynthesis of the encoded multivalent HIV-1 antigens. A suitable host cell is one<br>
which has the capability for the biosynthesis of the gene products as a consequence of the<br>
introduction of the nucleic acid. In particular embodiments, a suitable host cell is one which responds<br>
to a control sequence and to a terminator sequence, if any, which may be included within the<br>
construct. In order to respond in this fashion, such a host cell contains within it components which<br>
interact with a control sequence and with a terminator, and act to carry out the respective promoting<br>
and terminating functions. When the host cell is cultured in vitro, it may be a prokaryote, a single-<br>
celled eukaryote or a vertebrate cell. In particular embodiments, the host cell is a mammalian cell<br><br>
VI.	Stimulation of Immunological Responses to HIV-1<br>
With the provision herein of polyepitope polypeptide antigens specific to HIV-1, methods<br>
are now enabled for the stimulation of immune responses to such antigens in subjects. In certain<br>
embodiments, such immune responses will be protective against HIV-1 infection in the subject.<br>
MCMV polyepitope polypeptides (singly or in combination) can be used, for instance, as<br>
immunogenic agents in the inhibition, treatment, or amelioration of HIV-1. Subjects selected for this<br>
type of treatment are those who are known to have, or are suspected of having or are at risk of<br>
suffering, a HTV-1 infection.<br>
The provided immunostimulatory MCMV polyepitope polypeptides, or constructs or vectors<br>
encoding such polypeptides, are combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle for<br>
administration as an immunostimulatory composition or a vaccine to human or animal subjects. In<br>
some embodiments, more than one polyepitope polypeptide may be combined to form a single<br>
preparation.<br>
The immunogenic formulations may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and<br>
prepared using conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing<br>
into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the<br>
formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient<br>
with liquid carriers. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes<br>
which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The<br>
formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules<br>
and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a<br>
sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous<br>
injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets<br>
commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In certain embodiments, unit dosage formulations are those containing a dose or unit, or an<br>
appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient. It should be understood that in addition<br>
to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, formulations encompassed herein may include other<br>
agents commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compositions provided herein, including those for use as immunostimulatory agents or<br>
vaccines, may be administered through different routes, such as oral, including buccal and sublingual,<br>
rectal, parenteral, aerosol, nasal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, and topical. They may be<br>
administered in different forms, including but not limited to solutions, emulsions and suspensions,<br>
microspheres, particles, microparticles, nanoparticles, and liposomes.<br>
The volume of administration will vary depending on the route of administration. By way of<br>
example, intramuscular injections may range from about 0.1 ml to about 1.0 ml. Those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will know appropriate volumes for different routes of administration.<br><br>
The amount of protein in each vaccine dose is selected as an amount that induces an<br>
immunostimulatory or immunoprotective response without significant, adverse side effects. Such<br>
amount will vary depending upon which specific immunogen is employed and how it is presented.<br>
Initial injections may range from about 1 ug to about 1 mg, with some embodiments having a range<br>
of about 10 g to about 800 g, and still other embodiments a range of from about 25 g to about 500<br>
g. Following an initial vaccination, subjects may receive one or several booster immunizations,<br>
adequately spaced. Booster injections may range from about 1 ug to about 1 mg, with other<br>
embodiments having a range of about 10 g to about 750 g, and still others a range of about 50 g to<br>
about 500 g. Periodic boosters at intervals of 1-5 years, for instance three years, may be desirable to<br>
maintain the desired levels of protective immunity.<br>
As described in WO 95/01441, the course of the immunization may be followed by in vitro<br>
proliferation assays of PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes) co-cultured with ESAT6 or ST-CF, and<br>
especially by measuring the levels of IFN-released from the primed lymphocytes. The assays are<br>
well known and are widely described in the literature, including in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,791,932;<br>
4,174,384 and 3,949,064.<br>
A relatively recent development in the field of immune stimulatory compounds (for<br>
example, vaccines) is the direct injection of nucleic acid molecules encoding peptide antigens<br>
(broadly described in Janeway &amp; Travers, Immunobiology: The Immune System In Health and<br>
Disease, page 13.25, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 1997; and McDonnell &amp; Askari, N. Engl.<br>
J. Med. 334:42-45,1996). Plasmids (vectors) that include nucleic acid molecules described herein, or<br>
that include a nucleic acid sequence encoding an immunogenic MCMV polyepitope polypeptide may<br>
be utilized in such DNA vaccination methods.<br>
Thus, the terms "immunostunulatory preparation" and "vaccine" as used herein also include<br>
nucleic acid vaccines in which a nucleic acid molecule encoding a MCMV polyepitope polypeptide is<br>
administered to a subject in a pharmaceutical composition. For genetic immunization, suitable<br>
delivery methods known to those skilled in the art include direct injection of plasmid DNA into<br>
muscles (Wolff et al, Hum. Mol. Genet. 1:363,1992), delivery of DNA complexed with specific<br>
protein carriers (Wu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:16985, 1989), co-precipitation of DNA with calcium<br>
phosphate (Benvenisty and Reshef, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 83:9551,1986), encapsulation of DNA in<br>
liposomes (Kaneda et al., Science 243:375,1989), particle bombardment (Tang et al., Nature<br>
356:152,1992; Eisenbraun et al., DNA Cell Biol. 12:791,1993), and in vivo infection using cloned<br>
retroviral vectors (Seeger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:5849, 1984).<br>
Similarly, nucleic acid vaccine preparations can be administered via viral carrier.<br>
It is also contemplated that the provided immunostimulatory molecules and preparations can<br>
be administered to a subject indirectly, by first stimulating a cell in vitro, which stimulated cell is<br>
thereafter administered to the subject to elicit an immune response.<br><br>
VII. Immunological and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Immunological compositions, including immunological elicitor compositions and vaccines,<br>
and other pharmaceutical compositions containing latency-specific polypeptides or antigenic<br>
fragments thereof are useful for reducing, ameliorating, treating, or possibly preventing HIV<br>
infection, particularly HIV-1 infection. One or more of the polypeptides are formulated and<br>
packaged, alone or in combination with adjuvants or other antigens, using methods and materials<br>
known to those skilled in the vaccine art An immunological response of a subject to such an<br>
immunological composition may be used therapeutically or prophylactically, and in certain<br>
embodiments provides antibody immunity and/or cellular immunity such as that produced by T-<br>
lymphocytes, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes or CD4+ T-lymphocytes.<br>
The MCMV polyepitope polypeptides may be administered with an adjuvant in an amount<br>
effective to enhance the immunogenic response against the conjugate. At this time, the only adjuvant<br>
widely used in humans has been alum (aluminum phosphate or aluminum hydroxide). Saponin and<br>
its purified component Quil A, Freund's complete adjuvant and other adjuvants used in research and<br>
veterinary applications have toxicities which limit their potential use in human vaccines. However,<br>
chemically defined preparations such as muramyl dipeptide, monophosphoryl lipid A, phospholipid<br>
conjugates such as those described by Goodman-Snitkoff et al. (J. Immunol. 147:410-415,1991),<br>
encapsulation of the conjugate within a proteoliposome as described by Miller et al. (J. Exp. Med.<br>
176:1739-1744,1992), and encapsulation of the protein in lipid vesicles may also be useful.<br>
The compositions provided herein, including those formulated to serve as vaccines, may be<br>
stored at temperatures of from about-100° C to about 4° C. They may also be stored in a lyophilized<br>
state at different temperatures, including higher temperatures such as room temperature. The<br>
preparation may be sterilized through conventional means known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Such means include, but are not limited to, filtration, radiation and heat. The preparations also may<br>
be combined with bacteriostatic agents, such as thimerosal (ethyl(2-mercaptobenzoate-S)mercury<br>
sodium salt) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), to inhibit bacterial growth.<br>
A variety of adjuvants known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be administered in<br>
conjunction with the protein(s) in the provided vaccine composition. Such adjuvants include but are<br>
not limited to the following: polymers, co-polymers such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene<br>
copolymers, including block co-polymers; polymer P1005; Freund's complete adjuvant (for animals);<br>
Freund's incomplete adjuvant; sorbitan monooleate; squalene; CRL-8300 adjuvant; alum; QS 21,<br>
muramyl dipeptide; CpG oligonucleotide motifs and combinations of CpG oligonucleotide motifs;<br>
trehalose; bacterial extracts, including mycobacterial extracts; detoxified endotoxins; membrane<br>
lipids; or combinations thereof.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a vaccine is packaged in a single dosage for immunization by<br>
parenteral (that is, intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous) administration or nasopharyngeal<br>
(that is, intranasal) administration. In certain embodiments, the vaccine is injected intramuscularly<br>
into the deltoid muscle. The vaccine may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to<br><br>
facilitate administration. The carrier is, for instance, water, or a buffered saline, with or without a<br>
preservative. The vaccine may be lyophilized for resuspension at the time of administration or in<br>
solution.<br>
The carrier to which the polypeptide may be conjugated may also be a polymeric delayed<br>
release system. Synthetic polymers are particularly useful in the formulation of a vaccine to affect<br>
the controlled release of antigens.<br>
Microencapsulation of the polypeptide will also give a controlled release. A number of<br>
factors contribute to the selection of a particular polymer for microencapsulation. The reproducibility<br>
of polymer synthesis and the microencapsulation process, the cost of the microencapsulation<br>
materials and process, the toxicological profile, the requirements for variable release; kinetics and the<br>
physicochemical compatibility of the polymer and the antigens are all factors that must be<br>
considered. Examples of useful polymers are polycarbonates, polyesters, polyurethanes,<br>
polyorthoesters, polyamides, poly-(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and other biodegradable<br>
polymers.<br>
Doses for human administration of a pharmaceutical composition or a vaccine may be from<br>
about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, for instance about 1 mg/kg. Based on this range, equivalent<br>
dosages for heavier (or lighter) body weights can be determined. The dose may be adjusted to suit<br>
the individual to whom the composition is administered, and may vary with age, weight, and<br>
metabolism of the individual, as well as the health of the subject. Such determinations are left to the<br>
attending physician or another familiar with the subject and/or the specific situation. The vaccine<br>
may additionally contain stabilizers or physiologically acceptable preservatives, such as thimerosal.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate certain particular features and/or<br>
embodiments. These examples should not be construed to limit the invention to the particular<br>
features or embodiments described.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Existing HIV-1 vaccine constructs are subtype specific. Though multiple sub-type specific<br>
candidate vaccines are under development, areas with high numbers of recombinant viruses would<br>
likely pose problems for subtype specific vaccines.<br>
While the high degree of HIV variability has made vaccine design difficult, the proximity of<br>
populations with varying subtypes and the ease of travel have made a vaccine that can provide<br>
protection from multiple subtypes desirable. To address the problem of subtype variability, these<br>
examples illustrate production of constructs containing conserved B, T-helper, and CTL epitopes,<br>
with and without targeting domains. The chosen epitopes are expected to generate immune responses<br>
to multiple HTV-1 subtypes.<br><br>
Selection of epitopes<br>
In order to assemble a set of CTL epitopes that were conserved across a wide range of HIV-<br>
1 subtypes and that would be recognized by a large percentage of the population, the following<br>
databases and sources of sequence were consulted: Los Alamos HIV Molecular Immunology<br>
Database, Described Epitopes, LTNPs, EU and the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. The<br>
literature was also consulted, to locate reported conserved epitopes.<br>
The epitopes were selected based on conserved epitopes previously shown to be recognized<br>
by HIV-l-infected persons from published reports or the Los Alamos Data base. These antigenic<br>
fragments/epitopes were selected using the results of in vitro and in vivo protection studies compiled<br>
. in the Los Alamos database, as well as using the MotifScan software program. The following table<br>
(Table 1) provides the list of the multiple epitopes in the highly conserved regions in gag (p17, p24)<br>
pol (Prt, RT and Int) as well as Nef, Vif, Vpr, and Env epitopes selected based on their MHC class I<br>
binding (CTLs).<br>
Epitopes were selected that were greater than 50% conserved across all the available<br>
sequences. Of these, the majority of epitopes were &gt;90% conserved for subtypes A/B/C/D/E/F/G.<br>
Also taken into consideration was the frequency of Class I alleles that would recognize each<br>
conserved epitope.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
CTL/Proteosome Constructs<br>
Figure 1A shows the schematic map of one synthetic construct prepared to encode the<br>
identified conserved CTL epitopes. Representative nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HIV-I-<br>
MCMV-CTL with and without ubiquitin are shown in the accompanying Sequence Listing.<br>
Using the 55 conserved CTL epitopes identified as described above, a synthetic gene was<br>
constructed using SOE followed by PCR. The synthesis is illustrated in Figure 2A. A tri-amino acid<br>
spacer (KAA) was inserted between every 3-5 epitopes, to enhance peptide processing. Two parallel<br>
constructs were constructed, one with and one without ubiquitin (included to provide proteosomal<br>
targeting and further enhance peptide processing). pVAXMCMV-CTL (Figure 2C) contains a 1.3<br><br>
KB fragment coding for 55 CTL epitopes. pVAXMCMV-CTL-ubiquitin (Figure 2B) contains a 1.5<br>
KB fragment coding for 55 CTL epitopes, covalently linked (5') to a modified ubiquitin molecule.<br>
Expression of Multivalent Polypeptide from a MCMV Construct<br>
Recombinant proteins encoded by the synthetic genes have been produced in E. coli (Figure<br>
4). The expressed protein is larger, because the fusion tag attached to the protein is large. The fusion<br>
is detected (for example, in Figure 4) with an anti-Histidine monoclonal antibody, which detects the<br>
fusion tag (poly-His) encoded by the vector.<br>
Protein expression of Ubiquitin-CTL gene also has been confirmed in HeLa cells. A typical<br>
western blot analysis of HeLa Cells transfected with 1 g of pVAX MCMV-CTL-ubiquitin is shown<br>
in Figure 5. An anti-ubiquitin antibody was used for detection. These results indicate expression of<br>
an ubiquitinated protein of the correct predicted molecular weight as the synthetic CTL-ubiquitin<br>
gene. A band representing the normal cellular ubiquitin protein is also present on the blot.<br>
Elispot Assays<br>
To determine the biological relevance of epitopes used in the MCMV-CTL construct,<br>
epitopes contained in the construct were tested for recognition with PBMCs from HIV-1 infected<br>
individuals by doing Elispot assays. This example demonstrates that people infected with genetically<br>
different viruses could recognize epitopes included in the construct. Also since the individuals being<br>
tested are from different geographic locations, they are expected to have differences in their MHC<br>
molecules.<br>
Epitope Testing (Elispot)<br>
Chronically HIV-l-infected individuals infected with subtype B were selected from the HIV<br>
outpatient clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD) for testing cellular immune responses to<br>
HTV-1 (Keating et al, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses 18:1067-1079,2002). Subject<br>
median age was 42 years, with a range of 25-58 years. Median viral load was 2,228 copies/ml with a<br>
range of less than 330 copies/ml to 37,716 copies/ml. Two of the subjects (Nos. 10 and 15) used in<br>
the analysis had viral loads of greater than 15,000 copies/ml, and were identified as non-responders to<br>
subtype B Gag peptides in the test of Keating et al. (AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses<br>
18:1067-1079,2002). The average number of years patients were HIV-1 infected was 9.46 years<br>
(range 5-17 years), and median CD4+ cell count was 534 cells/mm3 with a range of 294-1009<br>
cells/mm3. These data represent a unique cohort of patients with strong immunological control as<br>
they have high CD4 values and have been HIV-1 infected for an average of nine years.<br>
Peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture and collected in heparin (Sigma, St. Louis,<br>
MO). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia-Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) gradient<br>
centrifugation, frozen in fetal calf serum (FCS; Summit) with 10% DMSO (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)<br>
and stored at -140°C.<br><br>
A 9x9 matrix (shown below) representing the 55 epitopes contained in the construct plus 23<br>
control peptides from Flu, EBV and CMV was generated to study Elispot responses, using 1 x 105<br>
cryopreserved PMBCs per well and 5 g/ml peptide (below). Samples were run in duplicate, and the<br>
positive cutoff defined as wells that had 2x more spots than negative control wells and at least 10<br>
spots. Responses identified in the matrix testing were confirmed with individual peptide testing.<br>
Elispot was carried out essentially as described in Keating et ah, AIDS Research and Human<br>
Retroviruses 18:1067-1079,2002.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Results:<br>
Eleven individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 subtype B (the subtype found in the US)<br>
were tested. Preliminary testing of individuals form Ivory Coast, West Africa (subtype A/G viruses)<br>
was also conducted. These data indicate that the CTL epitopes contained in the construct are<br>
recognized by individuals infected with genetically distinct subtypes of HIV-1.<br>
The eleven patients had confirmed responses to multiple epitopes, in pl7, p24, pol, vpr,<br>
gp41, gpl20, and nef. Representative bar graphs demonstrating breadth and magnitude of CTL<br>
responses generated from PBMCs of six of the eleven individuals chronically infected with<br>
subtype/clade B HTV-1 are shown in Figure 6. These patient data are also summarized in the<br>
following table (which also includes data from the remaining five individuals), and indicate the viral<br>
load of the individual, their CD4 count, the known HLA type of the individual and the known HLA<br>
binding properties of the epitopes to which the individual responded.<br><br><br><br>
Ten of the eleven (10/11) patients (90.9 %) responded to one or more peptides; 8/11 (72.7%)<br>
responded to two or more peptides in the multivalent construct. A summary of the peptides<br>
recognized from each gene region by the 11 chronically infected individuals (Subtype B) is provided<br>
in Table 6.<br><br>
Of the seven chronically HIV-infected study subjects who responded to HIV-1 individual<br>
peptides and had HLA typing made available, HLA specificities of the CTL epitopes were compared<br>
with the patient HLA types. All seven individuals responded to at least one of the predicted CTL<br>
epitopes according to the restricting HLA allele of that epitope. There was great variability as to<br>
whether patient cells could target those CTL epitopes predicted. Figure 7 shows the percentage of<br>
predicted epitopes that were targeted by the patients' CD8+ cells in the Elispot assay. Patient number<br>
21 responded to only one of the 12 peptides predicted to be targeted according to the patient's HLA<br>
type, whereas patient number 22 recognized all three of the peptides predicted to elicit Elispot<br>
responses. All of the 7 subject studies were capable of targeting epitopes outside of their respective<br>
HLA type. For example, patient number 3 who had been characterized for A30, A33, B53, and B14<br><br>
HLA type, only recognized p24 peptide sequence TSTLQEQIGW, which is a B57 HLA restricted<br>
CTL epitope. Of the 7 peptides targeted by patient number 11, four were epitopes restricted to<br>
mismatched HLA haplotype. All five of the HLA restricted epitopes targeted by patient number 21<br>
were disparate for that individual's HLA type.<br>
Preliminary testing of individuals infected with other subtypes of virus (A from Kenya, C<br>
from India and A/E from Thailand) is underway.<br>
Additional testing was carried out using PBMCs from HIV-1 positive blood donors from<br>
Ivory Coast. The testing was done as described for the subtype B individuals, in that the same<br>
peptide pool matrix was tested as describe above. The four Ivorian samples tested were from<br>
"healthy" blood donors and thus were presumed to be incident HIV-1 infections. Due to the high<br>
prevalence of recombinant subtype A/G viruses in this region, it is presumed these individuals were<br>
infected with A/G viruses. The four individuals had broad responses based on the results of the<br>
peptide matrix screen.<br>
Individual 1 had predicted responses from the matrix to 46 peptides contained in MCMV.<br>
The gene regions represented by these peptides included p24, pol, nef, gpl20, vpr, and vif.<br>
Individual 2 had predicted responses to 15 peptides (in pol, nef, gp41, and vif). Individual 3 had<br>
predicted responses to 10 peptides (in p24, nef, vpr, and gpl20). Individual 4 had predicted<br>
responses to 47 epitopes contained in the following HIV-1 gene regions: pl7, p24, pol, nef, gpl20,<br>
gp41, vpr, and vif.<br>
Overall, good CTL responses were observed to chosen epitopes (in gag, pol, env, nef, vpr,<br>
and vif) in subtype B infected individuals from the United States and presumed subtype A/G infected<br>
individuals from Ivory Coast.<br>
Mouse studies<br>
Transgenic HLA mice studies can be carried out to detect immunologic: responses induced<br>
by each construct (with and without ubiquitin). A comparison of the with and without ubiquitin<br>
constructs will enable characterization of the effects of ubiquitin on epitope processing and<br>
immunogenicity.<br>
One HTV-1 epitope was included in the MCMV-CTL construct (located in the middle of the<br>
construct) which has previously been shown to be recognized by mice expressing MHC class IH-2D.<br>
The inclusion of this epitope allows limited immunogenicity studies with any mouse strain that<br>
expresses the H-2D allele. In addition, transgenic mice that express human MHC molecules (such as<br>
the C57BL/6-TgN(HLA-A2.1) strain) can be used to further look at all of the epitopes in the<br>
construct that are A2.1 restricted. By way of example, 1-3 doses of the DNA can be tested, likely 2-5<br>
g of DNA at a time, applying the DNA interdermally using a gene gun.<br>
Mice will be sacrificed and splenocytes will be harvested 7-10 days after the last injection.<br>
The splenocytes will then be used in Elispot assays to determine if the mice recognize specific<br>
peptides contained within the construct. Parallel studies can be done with the construct with and<br><br>
without ubiquitin to demonstrate that the ubiquitin fusion increases CTL responses (breadth, A2.1<br>
restricted epitopes, and magnitude).<br>
Primate Studies<br>
Due to the inclusion of the Mamu- A*01 restricted epitope, monkeys that have this HLA can<br>
be used to study the effects of adding the ubiquitin tag, and to characterize the resultant changes in<br>
the magnitude of the immunogenic responses.<br>
B-CELL/T-HELPER CELL/LYSOSOME CONSTRUCTS<br>
The B-cell (Table 7) and T-helper (Table 8) epitopes were chosen by literature searches and<br>
information and software contained in the Los Alamos HIV Molecular Immunology database.<br><br><br><br>
Construction of a MCMV construct containing these B-cell and T-helper epitopes was<br>
carried out essentially similarly to the procedures used to generate the MCMV-CTL construct.<br>
Representative sequences of MCMV-AB/Th construct are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 9; the<br>
encoded multivalent antigen polypeptides are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 8 and 10. A tri-amino acid<br>
spacer (GPG) was inserted between each of the Ab epitopes and between every 3-5 T-helper epitopes,<br><br>
to provide additional flexibility in the molecule, and to enhance peptide presentation. In addition, the<br>
LIMP-II lysosomal targeting sequence was included at the C-terminus in one construct (SEQ ID<br>
NOs: 7 and 8), to enhance processing of the epitopes.<br>
Synthetic peptides of the T-helper epitopes have been synthesized, using standard peptide<br>
synthesis protocols, for use in lymphocyte proliferation assays.<br>
Targeting to Lysosome<br>
Detection of targeting of a MCMV-AB/Th polypeptide to the lysosome can be accomplished<br>
using confocal microscopy. By way of example, HeLa cells can be transfected with the pVax-1<br>
MCMV constructs (with and without and ubiquitin) followed by staining protocols to detect the<br>
lysosome (detection of LAMP-1 using a LAMP-1-specific antibody) and the expressed MCMV<br>
protein (for example, using polyclonal antibody generated by injection of the recombinant MCMV<br>
protein into mice). A detailed protocol for the detection of lysosomal targeting is found in Rodriguez<br>
et al,, J. Virology 75:10421-10430,2001.<br>
Confirmation of Immunogenicity of Ab and T-helper construc(s)<br>
In order to confirm the immunogenicity of the epitopes in a MCMV-AB/Th construct, T-<br>
helper assays (Lymphocyte proliferation assays) can be performed using PBMCs from HIV-1<br>
infected individuals, using methods basically as described in Wilson et al. J. Virology 75:4195-4207,<br>
2001.<br>
For the antibody epitopes, sera/plasma from infected individuals can be used to test for the<br>
presence of antibodies that would react with the protein encoded by this construct. Additionally,<br>
mouse or monkey immunization studies with either the DNA construct or purified recombinant<br>
MCMV-AB/Th protein (practically any strain of mouse or primate routinely available) can be<br>
preformed to ascertain the production of antibodies. Animals would be injected with 1-3 doses of<br>
DNA (2-5 g DNA for mice and 1-2 mg DNA for rhesus macaques) or purified recombinant protein<br>
(20-50 g for mice or 50-500 ug for monkeys). Prior to the first injection and 1-2 weeks following<br>
each injection, blood will be drawn and tested for the presence of antibody specific to the MCMV-<br>
AB/Th epitopes by EUSA.<br>
Other methods for testing the immunogenicity of Ab and T-helper epitopes will be known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Determination of the optimal time frame for vaccination with the recombinant protein as an<br>
immunologic "boost"<br>
Recombinant protein produced from the MCMV constructs described herein can be utilized<br>
in conjunction with the DNA immunogen(s), or other currently available DNA vaccines, as an<br>
immunological "boost".<br><br>
Following the initial animal injections with the DNA construct(s) immune responses will be<br>
monitored (for instance, using CTLs, Elispot assays, T-helper/lymphocyte proliferation assays, and/or<br>
ELISA assays) to determine the peak of the immune response for each arm of the immune system (T-<br>
Cell and B-cell). Based on the observed responses, a series of boost injections of a MCMV<br>
polypeptide can be initiated. By studying the responses, the time frame to generate the maximum<br>
response from memory T or B-cells can be optimized. Systems for optimizing the boost effect will<br>
be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Clinical trials<br>
Following the production of the vaccine materials, Phase I safety trials can be performed in<br>
populations at risk for HIV. In the United States, target populations would include, for example, gay<br>
male cohorts or IV Drug using cohorts. In countries other than the United States, potential<br>
populations would include, for example, prenatal cohorts, IV drug use cohorts and prostitutes.<br>
