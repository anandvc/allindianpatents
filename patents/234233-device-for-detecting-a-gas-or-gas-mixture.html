				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A Device for Detecting a Gas or Gas Mixture<br>
The invention concerns a device consisting of at least one Lundstrom-FET gas sensor, for<br>
detecting a gas or a gas mixture.<br>
Such a device for detecting hydrogen gas is well known from DE 43 33 875 C2. As a gas sensor, it<br>
consists of a transistor called the Lundstrom Field Effect transistor. The Lundstrom-FET has a<br>
gas-sensitive coating which is capacitatively coupled between an electrical insulating coating and<br>
the channel domain of the FET. The Lundstrom-FET works on the basis of the principle that<br>
hydrogen atoms separated or adsorbed from the environment become polarized and bring about a<br>
change in the threshold voltage of the FET when they reach the boundary between the gas layer<br>
and the insulating layer. The disadvantage here, however, is that in order to reach the insulating<br>
layer, the hydrogen atom must be diffused through the gas-sensitive layer. For that reason, the<br>
Lundstrom-FET has a relatively slow response time. Admittedly, the response time can be<br>
reduced by heating the Lundstrom-FET, but this requires a not insignificant use of energy.<br>
Moreover, the Lundstrom-FET has a certain sensitivity to other gases besides hydrogen.<br>
A hydrogen detection device is well known from DE 43 33 875 C2, which is a gas-sensor based on<br>
the principle of the Suspended Gate Field Effect Transistors (SGFET), with a gas-sensitive coating<br>
that is capacitatively coupled across an air gap to a channel domain placed between a Source-<br>
and a Drajn domain. The gas-sensitive coating reacts when it comes into contact with hydrogen<br>
gas, by changing its output, which induces a voltage on the surface of the coating, which sends<br>
the current across the channel domain between the Source- and the Drain domain. The gas-<br>
sensitive coating, however, is also sensitive to other gases besides hydrogen. In environments in<br>
which such other gases might be found, the detection of hydrogen gas can become very<br>
imprecise. This is the case, for example, for detecting leaks in the hydrogen fuel lines for motor<br>
vehicles using hydrogen as a source of fuel.<br>
Because hydrogen gas is highly explosive when it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen,<br>
any leak must be detected as quickly as possible, in order to either block the delivery of hydrogen<br>
and/or to warn the user of the motor vehicle, before a critical concentration of hydrogen gas in the<br>
surrounding air is exceeded. However, false alarms which might occur because of the cross-<br>
sensitivity of the gas-sensor to other gases should be avoided in all circumstances, since such<br>
false alarms might lead to cutting off the supply of hydrogen fuel, and the stalling of the motor<br>
vehicle.<br>
The objective therefore is to make to make a device of the above-cited kind, which will make it<br>
possible to detect a gas with greater precision and reliability. The other objective is to create a<br>
device of the above-cited kind, which will make it possible to detect in a simple fashion, a gas<br>
mixture consisting of at least of two gases.<br>
The first cited objective is solved by means of building the device with at least one gas sensor<br>
consisting of a Lundstrom-FET, and another gas sensor consisting of an SGFET; where at least<br>
one Lundstrom-FET and one SGFET are connected to a processing device, which is configured in<br>
such a way that it can analyze the sensor signals of both kinds of gas-sensors for the detection of<br>
gases or gas mixtures.<br>
The knowledge underlying the invention is that the Lundstrom-FET and the SGFET have distinct<br>
characteristics for the detection of gases, and that through the apparently unnecessary<br>
combination of these two kinds of gas-sensors and the analysis of the different sensor signals,<br>
these gas sensors can detect gases with a significantly greater precision than could be done by a<br>
device outfitted with only one kind of gas-sensor. In particular, the device according to the<br>
invention makes it possible to have a much lower cross-sensitivity towards gases other than the<br>
one to be detected, since the SGFET and the Lundstrom-FET have different sensitivities, so that<br>
through the comparison of the sensor signals of the two kinds of gas-sensors, when leak-proofing<br>
tests are being done in a motor vehicle in actual testing, it is possible to detect in a given case,<br>
to what degree the sensor signal was caused by the motor vehicle's fuel gas, and/or at least one<br>
other gas.<br>
In a second functional embodiment of the invention, the Lundstrom-FET has a first Drain and a<br>
first Source located upon the substrate of a semiconductor chip, between which a first channel<br>
domain is to be found, which is provided with a first gas-sensitive coating, which reacts by<br>
changing its output when there is a change in the concentration of the gas to be detected, and is<br>
capacitatively coupled across a dielectric coating to the first channel domain, where the SGFET is<br>
located upon the substrate next to the Lundstrom-FET of a second Drain and a second Source,<br>
between which a second channel domain is to be found, which has a Suspended Gate with a<br>
second gas-sensitive coating, which reacts by changing its output when there is a change in the<br>
concentration of the gas to be detected, and/or of a gas different from the former, to which the<br>
Lundstrom-FET has a cross-sensitivity, and is capacitatively coupled across an air gap to a<br>
second channel domain. For this application, a processing device can be configured in such a way<br>
that it analyzes the sensor signals of both kinds of gas sensors, in order to compensate for cross-<br>
sensitivity. The dielectric coating preferably consists of SiO2, Si3N4, AI2O3, or a mixed oxide of<br>
these materials.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention would have at least a second Drain, a second Source, a<br>
second channel domain and a Gate-Electrode of at least one SGFET, of at least one Lundstrom-<br>
FET and, as the case may be, a processing device integrated on the same semi-conductor chip.<br>
On the one hand, this makes possible a compact and economical device, while on the other hand,<br>
the close-packed spatial arrangement of the gas-sensors ensures that the gas coming into contact<br>
with the individual gas sensors will have the same composition. Moreover, integrating the gas<br>
sensors on the semiconductor chip ensures that the gas sensors will have the same temperature.<br>
This device thus makes it possible to measure and detect gas with greater precision and reliability.<br>
Preferably the first gas-sensitive coating would consist of palladium and/or a palladium alloy, and<br>
the second gas-sensitive coating of palladium and/or platinum and/or at least an alloy containing<br>
one of these metals. These materials make it possible to attain particularly high detection<br>
sensitivities for hydrogen gas. Ammonia (NH3) also, and/or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can be<br>
measured with the device in accordance with the invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the Suspended Gate is lengthened on one side until it<br>
reaches the Lundstrom-FET, and preferably covers it completely. The device can then be<br>
produced simply and economically with the state-of-the-art materials for semiconductor<br>
preparation.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one electrical resistance element preferably<br>
integrated on the semiconductor chip is connected to a processing device, which element consists<br>
of a material whose electrical resistance value is dependent upon the concentration of hydrogen<br>
gas; while the processing device will be configured in such a way that it analyzes a sensor signal<br>
from the resistance element for the detection of hydrogen gas. For this, the resistance element<br>
consists preferentially of a palladium-nickel alloy, whose specific electrical resistance varies in<br>
proportion to the concentration of hydrogen gas surrounding the resistance element. The<br>
resistance element is preferably in the form of a thin coating. It can be configured as a Gate-<br>
Electrode in the channel domain of a Field Effect Transistor (FET). The resistance element makes<br>
it possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen gas in the environment from approximately<br>
0.5% to 100%. The processing device compares and analyzes the sensor signals from the<br>
SGFET, the Lundstrom-FET, and from the resistance element with one another, and thus it<br>
creates, from signals coming from three different kinds of hydrogen gas detecting sensors, one<br>
signal that measures hydrogen concentration.<br>
Preferably the semiconductor chip will be provided with an electrical heating element. This would<br>
allow for the Lundstrom-FET to be heated in order to accelerate the diffusion of the gas to be<br>
detected into the second gas-sensitive coating, and thereby reduce the reaction time of the<br>
Lundstrom-FET's sensor signal to a change in gas concentration.<br>
This heating can also be used to heat the resistance element.<br>
It would be advantageous for at least one grooved depression to be made in the substrate,<br>
preferably on the backside of its gas-sensitive coating, which is so located relative to the heating<br>
element, that it will reduce the conduction of heat in a lateral direction. The groove can be formed<br>
as a ring or a window surrounding the heating device, or the heated area around the<br>
semiconductor chip. It is however also conceivable, that the groove would be shallow, and if need<br>
be, extend to the entire area of the substrate. When the semiconductor chip is prepared, first at<br>
least one Lundstrom-FET, at least one SGFE, and the processing device are placed upon the<br>
substrate; then a part of the substrate can be removed from the backside, using state-of-the-art<br>
methods, for example an etching process. In the region of the groove, the thickness of the<br>
substrate can be less than 70 µm and preferably less than 50 µm. Thanks to this groove, the<br>
semiconductor chip will have a low heat conduction in a lateral direction, and moreover, the<br>
groove will reduce the semiconductor chip's heat capacity.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, a temperature sensor, connected to the<br>
processing device, is integrated into the semiconductor chip, while the processing device is so<br>
configured that the gas detection occurs as a function of the temperature sensor's signal. As a<br>
result, it is in particular possible to compensate for the temperature dependence of the Source-<br>
Drain current of the field effect transistors, which is particularly advantageous when at least one<br>
gas sensor consists of a MOSFET.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the processing device would be configured in such a<br>
way that it would generate a differential signal and/or a sum signal from the sensor signals for both<br>
kinds of gas sensors, while the gas detection would result depending upon the differential- and/or<br>
sum signal. Because these two kinds of gas sensors have a differential cross-sensitivity vis a vis<br>
the target gas, it will be possible to use the differential signal to identify components of the signal<br>
which are caused by gases other than the target gas.<br>
The processing device can be configured in such a way, that in detecting the gas, it will respond to<br>
the polarity and/or the quantity of the differential signal. From the polarity in particular,<br>
measurement signals or sections of measurement signals can be determined, which are induced<br>
by gases that bring about changes in sensor signal output in both kinds of sensors, which are<br>
oriented in opposite directions to each other.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the processing device is configured in such a way that it will<br>
produce a Quotient signal from the signals received from the two kinds of gas sensors, so that the<br>
detection of the gas depends upon the Quotient signal. The differential signal can then be<br>
compared to at least one given value or range of values, in order to detect the presence of a gas<br>
corresponding to a given value or range of values indicating cross-sensitivity. For detecting such<br>
a gas, the signals of the gas sensor which is characterized by cross-sensitivity can be ignored, or<br>
taken into consideration only in a weakened form, and the measurement of concentration of the<br>
relevant gas is performed primarily or exclusively by the other kind of gas sensor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the device can be switched, with the help of a<br>
switching device, from fully operational to powersaving, where in the powersaving mode, the<br>
heating, and if necessary, the Lundstrom-FET are switched off; and where the processing device<br>
is configured in such a way that in the powersaving mode, it preferentially processes only the<br>
sensor signal from the SGFET for the detection of gas. With a leak-detection device for the<br>
hydrogen fuel line of a motor vehicle, the switching between fully operational and powersaving<br>
modes can be set up as a function of the motor vehicle's operational status. In this process, the<br>
system would be switched to fully operational when the fuel cells are switched on, in order to<br>
achieve the most precise leak detection, while the powersaving mode would be activated when the<br>
fuel cells are switched off, in order to spare the motor vehicle's battery.<br>
In some cases it would be possible to design the switching device in such a way that it would<br>
switch from full operational to powersaving if the measured gas concentration exceeds a given<br>
standard value, so that the switching device if need be would likewise switch from powersaving to<br>
fully operational, if the gas concentration measured were to drop below the given standard value.<br>
In this case, the assumption is that the SGFET can measure a higher gas concentration than the<br>
Lundstrom-FET. The aforesaid standard value is preferably chosen in such a way that to some<br>
extent it will match the concentrations of the gases to be detected, which can be measured with<br>
the Lundstrom-FET when they are at maximum levels. In this way, whenever there are high<br>
concentrations of gas, mistaken readings due to the limits of the measurement range of the<br>
Lundstrom-FET, can be avoided and the energy demands of the device will be reduced.<br>
It would be advantageous for the processing device to stand connected in a controlling<br>
relationship to the switch, in such a way that the powersaving mode would be switched over to the<br>
fully operational, if the SGFET sensor signal should be of a cross-section typical for the presence<br>
of the gas; and, if necessary return to the powersaving mode when such a sensor signal is no<br>
longer detected. When the SGFET is in the powersaving mode and detects a sensor signal which<br>
might have been caused by the gas to be detected, then the heating element, and if need be, the<br>
Lundstrom-FET are turned on, and then with the help of both kinds of sensor signals, a more<br>
precise measurement of the gas concentration can be made. If the suspicion of the presence of a<br>
prohibited high concentration of gas is confirmed in the process, an alarm will be sounded and/or<br>
the fuel line can be blocked. Thus, in spite of a reduced energy consumption, the device enables a<br>
reliable and precise detection of gas, in particular hydrogen gas.<br>
The previously cited objective can also be solved by a device of the above-cited kind, where the<br>
Lundstrom-FET is located upon the substrate of a semiconductor chip of a first Drain and a first<br>
Source, between which a first channel domain is to be found, which is provided with a coating for<br>
detecting a second gas different from the first gas which is to be detected by the Lundstrom-FET,<br>
which reacts with a change in its output when there is a change in concentration of the target gas,<br>
and is capacitatively coupled across an air gap to a second channel domain; where the processing<br>
device is configured<br>
in such a way that for gas detection it analyzes the sensor signals relating to the presence of a gas<br>
mixture containing at least a first and a second gas, from both kinds of gas sensors.<br>
These two gases might be such as those released by a fire; thus the device can be used to detect<br>
fires. Here it is also possible that a number of spatially separated semiconductor chips, each<br>
consisting of at least one Lundstrom-FET and one SGFET, will be connected to a central<br>
processing device. This can be connected to a fire alarm. <br><br>
One example of an embodiment of the invention is given below, and explained in more detail by <br>
means of a diagram. The following accompanying diagrams are shown: <br>

have been integrated to function as a hydrogen sensor,<br>

as a function of the hydrogen gas concentration, where the abscissa gives the Time, t,<br>

the right, the concentration C of the hydrogen gas in ppm,<br>

hydrogen gas on the ordinate, the concentration of ammonia gas is given, and<br>
Fig. 4 An illustration similar to Fig. 2, where however, instead of the hydrogen gas<br>
concentration on the ordinate, the CH4 gas concentration is given.<br>
A device for detecting a gas, namely hydrogen, for example in a motor vehicle which uses<br>
hydrogen as a fuel, has two kinds of sensors, namely an SGFET 1 and a Lundstrom-FET 2. The<br>
SGFET 1 and the Lundstrom-FET 2 are connected to a processing device which is not illustrated<br>
in detail in the drawing, which is configured in such a way, that it allows for the processing of<br>
sensor signals from both kinds of gas sensors, regarding the concentration of the hydrogen gas<br>
present in the neighborhood of the gas sensors.<br>
In Fig. 1, it can be seen that the SGFET 1 and the Lundstrom-FET 2 are integrated on a substrate<br>
3 in a semiconductor chip designated in its entirety by 4. It can be seen clearly that hollow zones<br>
are to be found in the surface of Substrate 3, which can be filled with charge carriers; these zones<br>
are called wells 5,6.<br>
The left half of Fig. 1 shows a first well, 5, in which a first Drain 7 and a first Source 8, which are<br>
dedicated to the Lundstrom-FET 2, are located, and which are configured through areas which<br>
have the second type of charge carrier. Between the first Drain 7 and the first Source 8, a channel<br>
domain 9 is configured, which has been coated with a dielectric coating 10 , and upon that, a first<br>
gas-sensitive coating 11, which consists of palladium and/or a palladium alloy.<br>
The neighboring region 12 of the dielectric coating 10 of the first gas-sensitive coating 11, is<br>
capacitatively coupled between the dielectric coating 10 to the first channel domain 9. The first<br>
gas-sensitive coating 11 is electrically connected with the reference voltage junction. Hydrogen<br>
can be absorbed by an exposed surface 13 of the first gas-sensitive coating 11, and it can be<br>
diffused through coating 11 to reach the boundary surface 12.<br>
In the lateral direction, besides the first well 5, there is a second well 6 to be found in the surface<br>
of the substrate 3, in which a second Drain 14 and a second Source 15 have been placed for the<br>
SGFET. Between the second Drain 14 and the second Source 15, a channel domain 16 is<br>
configured, which is covered with a thin insulating coating and upon that, a Gate Electrode 17.<br>
On the side of the second channel domain 16 oriented away from the substrate 3, there is a<br>
second gas sensitive coating 19 oriented to the channel domain 16 on a bridge-like suspended<br>
gate 18 spanning the channel domain 16. The second gas-sensitive coating 19 consists of<br>
palladium, platinum and/or an alloy that contains at least one of these metals, and reacts in<br>
response to a change in the concentration of hydrogen with a change in its output.<br>
The gas-sensitive coating 19 is capacitatively coupled with its flat surface 20, dedicated to the<br>
second channel domain 16, to the second channel domain 16 across an air gap 21 open to the<br>
immediate environment . On the back side 22 facing away from surface 20, a gas-sensitive<br>
coating 19 is connected via a conducting path not presented in more detail in the drawing, to a<br>
reference voltage junction, which has a defined voltage.<br>
The Source-Drain zone of the SGFET is connected to a first sensor signal input; and the Source-<br>
Drain zone of the Lundstrbm-FET 2 to a second sensor signal input of the processing device. In<br>
the processing device, the sensor signals from the two different kinds of gas sensors are first<br>
calibrated with the help of characteristic values placed into the memory, in order to smooth out any<br>
eventual initial tolerances, specifically the geometric dimensions of the gas sensors. After being<br>
calibrated in this way, the sensor signals are compared to one another and to characteristic values<br>
in the memory, and based on the results of this comparison, an alarm signal might be generated at<br>
the output port of the processing device, which would indicate the presence of hydrogen gas in the<br>
environment of the gas sensors.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that when the gas sensors make contact with a hydrogen gas, the sensor signal 23<br>
of the Lundstrom-FET 2 is greater in magnitude than the sensor signal 24 of the SGFET 1. Here<br>
the Quotient of sensor signal 23 of the Lundstrom-FET and the sensor signal 24 of SGFET 1 is<br>
approximately 1:1.4. Moreover it can be seen that the sensor signals of both kinds of gas sensors<br>
have a similar response time. In Fig. 2 the dotted line shows the concentration of hydrogen gas. It<br>
is clear that over time the concentration of the hydrogen gas exhibits a number of right-angled<br>
pulses, which are separated form each other by pulse pauses, in which the hydrogen gas<br>
concentration is approximately zero. During the pulse pauses, each of the sensor signals 23, 24<br>
from the two kinds of gas sensors diminishes, where the rate of the decrease diminishes in each<br>
case from the beginning of the relevant pulse pause to the end of the pulse pause.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the evolution over time of the gas sensor signal, when it is brought into contact with<br>
ammonia gas. It is clear that the sensor signal 23 of the Lundstrbm-FET is smaller than the<br>
sensor signal 24 of the SGFET 1. The Quotient from the sensor signal 23 of the Lundstrom-FET 2<br>
and the sensor signal 24 of the SGFET 1 now lies approximately between 2:1 and 3.3:1. Thus it is<br>
now possible to determine, as a function of the quotient of the sensor signals 23, 24, whether or<br>
not the gas sensors have come into contact with hydrogen or with another gas.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the gas sensor signal when the sensor comes in contact with<br>
methane, namely CH4. Here it can be seen that the CH4 essentially only changes the sensor<br>
signal 23 of the Lundstrom-FET 2, while the sensor signal 24 of the SGFET 1 shows practically no<br>
reaction. Moreover, it can be seen that the sensor signal 23 of the Lundstrom-FET 2 at first shows<br>
a constant CH4 concentration within a given time frame, then rises to a maximum value, and then<br>
falls to a value which is greater than the value which the sensor signal showed before the<br>
Lundstrom-FET 2 came into contact with the CH4 gas. This example makes it possible to<br>
conclude on the basis of sensor signals 23, 24 of the gas sensors, that these are not in contact<br>
with hydrogen.<br>
The device for the gas detection thus consists at least of a first gas sensor consisting of an<br>
SGFET 1, and at least a second gas sensor consisting of an Lundstrom-FET 2. The gas sensors<br>
are connected to a processing device which is configured in such a way that it can process sensor<br>
signals 23, 24 of both kinds of gas detection sensors.<br>
