FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, in particular 4,4-disubstituted and 3,3-disubsiituted piperidine compounds, compositions containing them, and their use for treating medical disorders resulting from a deficiency in growth hormone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone is a hormone which stimulates growth of all tissues capable'uf growing. In addition, growth hormone is known to have a number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilisation and to cause a switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate to fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone can result in a number of severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism.<br>
Growth hormone is released from the pituitary. The release is under tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly. Growth hormone release can be stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the hypothalamus but their action is mediated primarily via specific receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds which stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary have also been described. For example arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenyiyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a synthetic hexapeptide, GHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide) release endogenous growth hormone either by a direct effect on the pituitary or by affecting the release of GHRH and/or somatostatin from the hypothalamus.<br>
In disorders or conditions where increased levels of growth hormone is desired, the protein nature of growth hormone makes anything but parenteral administration non-viable.<br><br>
Furthermore, other directly acting natural secretagogues, e.g., GHRH and PACAP, are longer polypeptides for which reason parenteral administration is preferred.<br>
The use of certain compounds for increasing the levels of growth hormone in mammals has previously been proposed, e.g. in EP 18 072, EP 83 864, WO 89/07110, WO 89/0*1711, WO 89/10933, WO 88/9780, WO 83/02272, WO 91/18016, WO 92/01711, WO 93/04081, WO 9517422, WO 9517423, WO 9514666, W09419367, W09534311, WO9602530, W09615148, W09613265, W09622997, W09635713, W09638471, W09632943, WO9700894, WO9706803, WO9709060, WO9707117, W09711697, WO9722620, WO9723508, W09724369, and WO9734604.<br>
The composition of growth hormone releasing compounds is important for their growth hor¬mone releasing potency as well as their bioavailability. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds with growth hormone releasing properties. Moreover, it is an object to provide novel growth hormone releasing compounds (growth hormone secre¬tagogues) which are specific and/or selective and have no or substantially no side-effects, such as e.g. release of LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, vasopressin, oxytocin, Cortisol and/or prolactin, it is also an object to provide compounds which have good oral bioavailability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided novel compounds which act directfy on the pituitary cells under normal experimental conditions in vitro to release growth hormone therefrom.<br>
These growth hormone releasing compounds can be utilized in vitro as unique research tools for understanding, inter alia, how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level.<br>
Moreover, the growth hormone releasing compounds of the present invention can also be administered in vivo to increase endogenous growth hormone release.<br><br>

The procedures used in this patent and illustrated in above scheme I are based on peptide couplings well known in the art, and should in no way be interpreted as limiting the invention in any way. In the first step an amine (1) and a carboxyiic acid is coupied to an amide by a coupling agent such as a carbodiimide and hydroxyazabenzoetriazole (HOAt). Prior to the next coupling a suitable protecting group such as tert butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) can be re¬moved with methods well known to those skilled in the art, thereby producing compound (2). It is also possible to avoid the use of protecting groups. Hereafter (2) is coupled to a carbox¬yiic acid of formula D-COOH by a coupling agent, thereby producing compound (3).<br><br><br>
Compounds of the general structure I containing a hydrazine in the C-term'tnal may be pre¬pared as illustrated above in scheme II. The procedures used in this patent and illustrated in above scheme It are based on peptide couplings well known in the art, and should in no way be interpreted as limiting the invention in any way. In the first step a mono-, di- or tri-substituted hydrazine or hydrazone (4) and an appropriate protected amino acid are coupled to form a compound (5) using a suitable coupling reagent such as 1 -ethy!-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or another cou¬pling reagent known in the art of peptide coupling in an appropriate solvent such as di-methylformamid or dichloromethane.. Hereafter, the amide (5) and a carboxyiic acid is cou¬pled by a coupling agent, thereby producing compound (6). Hereafter (6) is coupled to a car¬boxyiic acid of formula D-COOH by a coupling agent, thereby producing compound (7). In the procedure, prior to the next coupling a suitable protecting group such as tert butyloxy-carbonyl (Boc) can be removed with methods well known to those skilled in the art. It is also possible to avoid the use of protecting groups. The appropriate amino acids may be pro-<br><br>
tected and deprotected by methods known in the art and described by e.g. T.W. Green (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2. Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York 1991).<br>
The compounds of formula I exhibit an improved resistance to proteolytic degradation by enzymes because they are non-natural, in particular because the natural amide bonds are replaced by non-natural amide bond mimetics.

It has been demonstrated that compounds of the general formula I possess the ability to re¬lease endogenous growth hormone in vivo. The compounds may therefore be used in the treatment of conditions which require increased plasma growth hormone levels such as in growth hormone deficient humans or in elderly patients or livestock.<br>
Thus, in a particular aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier or diluent<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceuticaliy ac¬ceptable salt thereof.<br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary.<br>
To those skilled in the art, it is well known that the current and potential uses of growth hor¬mone in humans are varied and multitudinous. Thus, compounds of formula t can be adminis-<br><br>
tered for purposes stimulating release of growth hormone from the pituitary and would then have similar effects or uses as growth hormone itself. Compounds of formula I are useful for stimulation of growth hormone release in the elderly; prevention of catabolic side effects of glu¬cocorticoids, prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis, treatment of chronic fatigue syndrorr tCFS), treatment of acute fatigue syndrom and muscle loss following election surgery, stimula¬tion of the immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair, accelerating complicated fractures, e.g. disctraction osteogenesis, treatment of wasting secon¬dary to fractures, treatment of growth retardation, treating of growth retardation resulting from renal failure or insufficiency, treatment of cardiomyopathy, treatment of chronic liver disease, treatment of thrombocytopenia, treatment of Crohn's disease, treatment of short bowel syn¬drome, treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), treatment of complica¬tions associated with transplantation, treatment of physiological short stature including growth hormone deficient children and short stature associated with chronic illness, treatment of obe¬sity and growth retardation associated with obesity, treatment of anorexia, treating growth re¬tardation associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner's syndrome; increasing the growth rate of a patient having partial growth hormone insensitive syndrome, accelerating the recovery and reducing hospitalization of bum patients; treatment of intrauterine growth retarda¬tion, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisoiism and Cushing's syndrome; induction of pulsatile growth hormone release; replacement of growth hormone in stressed patients, treatment of osteo-chondrodysplasias, Noonan's syndrome, schizophrenia, depressions, Alzheimer's disease, delayed wound healing and psychosocial deprivation, treatment of pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency, treatment of cardiac failure or related vascular dysfunction, treatment of impaired cardiac function, treatment or prevention of myocardial infarction, lowering blood pressure, protection against ventricular dysfunction or prevention of reperfusion events, treat¬ment of adults in chronic dialysis, attenuation of protein catabolic responses after major sur¬gery, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; treat¬ment of hyperinsuiinemia including nesidioblastosis, adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction; to stimulate thymic development and prevent the age-related decline of thymic function, treat¬ment of immunosuppressed patients, treatment of sarcopenia, treatment of wasting in connec¬tion with AIDS, improvement in muscle strength, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis, renal homeostasis in the frail elderly, stimulation of osteoblasts, bone remodelling and cartilage growth, regulation of food intake, stimulation of the immune system in companion animals and treatment of disorder of aging in companion animals, promoting<br><br>
growth in livestock and stimulation of wool growth in sheep, treatment of metabolic syndrom (syndrom X), treatment of insulin resistance, including NIDDM, in mammals, e.g. humans, im¬provement of sleep quality and correction of the relative hyposomatotropism of senescence due to high increase in REM sleep and a decrease in REM latency, and treatment of hypo¬thermia. Treatment is also intended to include prophylactic treatment.<br>
For the above indications the dosage will vary depending an the compound of formula I em¬ployed, on the mode of administration and on the therapy desired. However, generally dosage levels between 0.0001 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily are administered to patients and ani¬mals to obtain effective release of endogenous growth hormone. Morever the compounds of formula I have no or substantially no side-effects, when administered in the above dosage lev¬els, such side-effects being e.g. release of LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, vasopressin, oxytocin, Corti¬sol and/or prolactin. Usually, dosage forms suitable for oral, nasal, pulmonat or transdermal administration comprise from about 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the compounds of formula I admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a compound of for¬mula I combined with one or more compounds exhibiting a different activity, e.g., an antibiotic or other pharmacologically active material.<br>
The route of administration may be any route which effectively transports the active compound to the appropriate or desired site of action, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal or par¬enteral, the oral route being preferred.<br>
Apart from the pharmaceutical use of the compounds of formula I, they may be useful in vitro tools for investigating the regulation of growth hormone release.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be useful in vivo tools for evaluating the growth hormone releasing capability of the pituitary. For example, serum samples taken before and after ad¬ministration of these compounds to humans can be assayed for growth hormone. Comparison of the growth hormone in each serum sample would directly determine the ability of the pa¬tients pituitary to release growth hormone.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I may be administered to commercially important animals to increase their rate and extent of growth, and to increase milk production.<br>
A further use of growth hormone secretagogue compounds of formula I is in combination with other secretagogues such as GHRP (2 or 6), GHRH and its analogues, growth hormone and its analogues or somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2.<br><br>
Pharmacological Methods<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated in vitro for their efficacy and potency to release growth hormone in rat pituitary primary cultures, and such evaluation may be performed as de¬scribed below.<br>
The isolation of rat pituitary cells is a modification of O. Sartor et al.. Endocrinology 116.1985, pp. 952-957. Mate albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250 +/- 25 grams) were purchased from Mellegaard, Lille Skensved, Denmark. The rats were housed in group cages (four ani¬mals/cage) and placed in rooms with 12 hour light cycle. The room temperature varied from 19-24"C and the humidity from 30 - 60%.<br>
The rats were decapitated and the pituitaries dissected. The neurointermediate lobes were re¬moved and the remaining tissue was immediately placed in icecold isolation buffer (Gey's me¬dium (Gibco 041-04030) supplemented with 0.25% D-glucose, 2% non-essential amino acids (Gibco 043-01140) and 1 % bovine serum albumine (BSA) (Sigma A-4503)). The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to isolation buffer supplemented with 3.8 mg/ml of trypsin (Worthington #3707 TRL-3) and 330 mg/ml of DNase (Sigma D-4527). This mixture was incu¬bated at 70 rotations/min for 35 min at 37"C in a 95/5% atmosphere of OJ/COJ. The tissue was then washed three times in the above buffer. Using a standard pasteur pipette, the tissue was then aspirated into single cells. After dispersion, cells were filtered through a nylon filter (160 mm) to remove undigested tissue. The cell suspension was washed 3 times with isolation buffer supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (0.75 mg/ml, Worthington #2829) and finally resu-spended in culture medium; DMEM (Gibco 041-01965) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco 043-05030H), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma S-8875), 0.1% non-essential amino acid. 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco 011-06290), 3% horse serum (Gibco 034-06050), 10% fresh rat serum, 1 nM T3 (Sigma T-2752) and 40 mg/l dexamethasone (Sigma D-4902) pH 7.3, to a density of 2 x 103 cells/ml. The cells were seeded into microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark), 200 ml/well, and cultured for 3 days at 37°C and 8%<br>
CO;.<br><br>
Compound testing<br>
After culturing, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solu¬tion (Gibco 041-04020) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma A-4503), 0.25% D-g!ucose (Sigma G-5250) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375) pH 7.3) and preincubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The buffer was exchanged with 90 ml stimulation buffer (37°C). Ten ml test compound solution was added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and 5% COj. The medium was de¬canted and analyzed for GH content in an rGH SPA test system.<br>
All compounds were tested in doses ranging from 10 pM to 100 mM. A dose-response relation was constructed using the Hill equation (Fig P, Biosoft). The efficacy (maximal GH released, E2 was expressed in % of the £„.,, of GHRP-6. The potency (ECR,) was determined as the concentration inducing half maximal stimulation of the GH release.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated for their metabolic stability using the procedure de¬scribed below:<br>
Compounds is dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. 25 ml of this solution is added to 175 ml of the respective enzyme-solution (resulting in an enzyme:substrate ratio (w/w) of approximately 1:5). The solution is left at 37°C overnight. 10 ml of the various degradation so¬lutions is analyzed against a corresponding zero-sample using flow injection eiectrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) with selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion. If the signal has de¬creased more than 20% compared to the zero-sample, the remainder of the solution is ana¬lyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry in order to identify the extent and site(s) of degradation precisely.<br>
Several standard peptides (ACTH 4-10, Angiotensin 1-14 and Glucagon) have been included in the stability tests in order to verify the ability of the various solutions to degrade peptides.<br>
Standard peptides (angiotensin 1-14, ACTH 4-10 and glucagon) were purchased from Sigma, MO, USA)<br><br>
Enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase aminopeptidase M ana carpoxypeptiaase Y ana u) were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany)<br>
Pancreatic enzyme mix: trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml).<br>
Carboxypeptidase mix: carboxypeptidase Y and B in 50 mM ammoniumacetate pH 4.5 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml).<br>
Aminopeptidase M solution: aminopeptidase M (0.025 mg/ml) in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbon¬ate pH 8.0<br>
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using two different mass spectrometers. A Sciex API IIJ triple quadrupole LC-MS instrument (Sciex instruments, Thomhill, Ontario) equipped with an electrospray ion-source and a Bio-ion 20 time-of-fiight Plasma Desorption instrument (Bio-Ion Nordic AS, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
Quantification of the compounds (before and after degradation) was done on the API III in¬strument using single ion monitoring of the molecular ion in question with flow injection of the analyte. The liquid flow (MeOH:water 1:1) of 100ml/min was controlled by an ABI 140BHPLC unit (Perkin-Bmer Applied Biosystems Divisions, Foster City, CA). The instrument parameters were set to standard operation conditions, and SIM monitoring was performed using the most intense molecular ion (in most cases this corresponded to the doubly charged molecular ion).<br>
Identification of degradation products furthermore involved the use of plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) with sample application on nitrocellulose coated targets and standard instrumental settings. The accuracy of the hereby determined masses is generally better than 0.1%.<br>
Separation and isolation of degradation products was done using a HY-TACH C-18 reverse phase 4.6x105 mm HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Aito, CA) with a standard acetonitril: TFA separation gradient. The HPLC system used was HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA).<br><br><br>
+: Stable (less than 20% decrease in SIM signal after 24 h in degradation solution) -: Unstable (more than 20% decrease in SIM signal after 24 h in degradation solution)<br>
Any novel feature or combination of features described herein is considered essential to this invention.<br>
