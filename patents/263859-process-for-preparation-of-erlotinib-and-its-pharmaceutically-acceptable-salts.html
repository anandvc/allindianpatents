ACCEPTABLE SALTS<br>
Technical field<br>
5 The present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of erlotinib and' its pharmaceuiicaliy acceptable salts.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Eriotinib is a Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 1/Epidermai Growth Factor 10  Receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor.<br>
Erlotinib is described chemically as N-(3-ethyny!phenyi)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazoiin-4-amine, and its hydrochloride salt is represented by the compound of Formula I.<br>
15<br><br>

The reaction mixture is cooled to 20-25°C and concentrated HCI is added to it. The resulting mixture is granulated at 20-25°C 5 to crystallize the product.<br>
Indian patent application 902/CHE/2006 discloses a process for preparation of N-(3-ethyny(phenyi}-6J-bis(2~methoxyethoxy)quinazo!in-4-arnine hydrochloride. The process involves reacting 3,4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde with substituted ethyimethy! ether in the<br>
10 presence of an inert solvent and base to obtain 3,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzaldehyde. This 3,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzaldehyde is converted to 3,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzaldoxime in the presence of a base and organic solvent and is further dehydrated to 3,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile. The benzonitrile so obtained is nitrated to obtain 4,5-bis{2-methoxyethoxy)-2-nitrobenzonitri!e which is further reduced to obtain 2-amino-<br>
15 4,5-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile. N'-(3-ethynylpheny!)-N,N-dimethyl formamidine obtained on formylation of 3-ethynyianiiine with N,N-dimethyl formamidine is coupled with 2-amino-4,5-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile to obtain erlotinib free base which on treatment with a polar solvent containing hydrochloric acid gives erlotinib hydrochloride.<br>
20 Indian patent application 904/CHE/2006 also discloses a process for preparation of N-(3-ethyny!phenyl)-6J-bis(2~methoxyethoxy)quinazoiin-4-amine hydrochloride. The process involves reacting 3,4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde with substituted ethyimethy! ether in the presence of an inert solvent and base to obtain 3,4-bis(2-methQxyethoxy) benzaldehyde. This 3,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzaldehyde is converted to 3(4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)<br>
25 benzaldoxime in the presence of a base and organic solvent and is further dehydrated to 3,4-bis{2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile. The benzonitrile so obtained is nitrated to obtain 4,5-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-2-nitrobenzonitriie which is further reduced to get 2-amino-4,5-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile. 2-amino-4,5-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) benzonitrile is formylated with a formylating agent in the presence of formic acid derivative to obtain N'-<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The first aspect of the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of N-(3-ethynylpheny!)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine and its pharmaceutical 15 acceptable salts. The process of the present invention is economical and commercially advantageous over the processes of the prior art.<br>
Generally the reaction of the amine and chloro compound is carried out in the presence of a base which promotes the reaction to completion. However, surprisingly it has been found<br>
20 that the reaction of the present invention can be carried out in the presence of an acid which forms another aspect of the invention wherein N-(3-ethynylpheny!)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazoiin-4-amine. is prepared by reacting a 4-halo-6,7~bis(2-methoxyethoxy) quinazoline with 3-arninopheny! acetylene or an acid salt thereof under acidic conditions.<br>
25<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a process which is carried out by reacting 4-ch!oro-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) quinazoline with 3-aminophenyl acetylene under acidic conditions.<br>
30 Yet another aspect of the present invention provides the preparation of N-(3-ethynyiphenyi)~6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine by reacting a 4-ha!o-6,7~bis<br><br>
WO 2008/122776<br><br>
PCT/GB2008/001186<br><br>
7 (2-methoxyethoxy) quinazoline with 3-aminophenyi acetylene or a sait thereof at a temperature below 40°C.<br>
Further,  the present invention provides preparation of N-{3-ethyny!phenyl)-6,7-bis(2-5 methoxyethoxy)quinazoIin-4-amine    by    reacting    a    4-halo-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy) quinazoline with 3-aminopheny! acetylene or a salt thereof in a suitable solvent.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the acidic conditions may be obtained by using an acid selected from the group consisting of a mineral acid, an organic acid or mixtures<br>
10 thereof. The acid may be selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, p-toiuene sulphonic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, benzene sulphonic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulphonic acid, phosphoric acid and mixtures thereof. Preferably the acid used is hydrochloric acid. The acid salt of erlotinib corresponds to the acidic conditions used, for example the use of<br>
15 hydrochloric acid will result in formation of the hydrochloride salt of erlotinib.<br>
The acid salt of erlotinib may be isolated and not converted to erlotinib base, or may be converted to erlotinib base.<br>
20 In an embodiment, the acid sait is purified before isolation, for example purified using a suitable solvent and dried. The solvent used for purification is preferably selected from Cr C4 alcohols, more preferably methanol.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt of 25 erlotinib is isolated. The salt may then be suspended in a suitable solvent and basified using a suitable base to obtain erlotinib. The base used may be selected from the group consisting of organic and inorganic bases. The base may be selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonia, pyridine, triethyl amine. The so-obtained erlotinib may then be 30 further converted to a second salt such as its hydrochloride salt, for example using hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride gas in a suitable organic solvent.   Other second<br><br>
WO 2008/122776<br><br>
PCT/GB2008/00US6<br><br>
s<br>
salts of eriotinib include the sulphate, oxalate, tosylate, phosphate, benzoate or mesylate • salts.<br>
One of the advantages of this reaction is that it does not require any heating as prior art 5 processes require. For example, the process described in EP0817775 involves adding 3-ethynylantline and 4-ch!oro-6,7-bis-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)quinazoIine to isopropanol containing pyridine and refluxing the mixture. In an embodiment, the process of the present invention is carried out at a temperature below the reflux temperature of the solvent used.<br>
10<br>
Furthermore, the reaction proceeds faster under the conditions of the present invention. The acid catalyses the reaction and also aids in formation of the salt. The presence of an acid catalyst increases the rate of reaction and leads to completion of reaction without the formation of any major impurities.<br>
15<br>
The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent which may be selected from the group consisting of water, C1-C4 alcohols, ketones, hydrocarbons or mixture thereof. The solvent used may be selected from the group consisting of water, dimethyl carbonate, special denatured spirit (SPDS), acetonitrile, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and mixtures<br>
20 thereof.<br>
A further advantage is that the reaction may be carried out under atmospheric conditions and it does not require any inert reaction conditions as required in the process disclosed in EP0817775. The prior art reactions are complicated and very lengthy while the reaction of 25 the present invention requires less time and is easy to carry out.<br>
In an embodiment, the process of the present invention can be represented as shown in the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
