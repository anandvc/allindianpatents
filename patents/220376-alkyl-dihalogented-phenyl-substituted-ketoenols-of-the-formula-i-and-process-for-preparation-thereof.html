				<td>The present invention relates to alkyl-dihalogented phenyl substituted ketoenols of the formula (I) and process for preparation thereof.<br>
The invention relates to new phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols, to a plurality of processes and intermediates for their preparation, and to their use as pesticides and herbicides.<br>
3-Acyl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones have already been described as having pharmaceutical properties (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones were synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985. 1095). A biological activity of these compounds has not been described.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds of a similar structure (3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones), which, however, have not been disclosed as having a herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action. Unsubstituted, bicyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) having a herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are known.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and IH-arylpyrrolidine-dione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 93/26954 and WO 95/01 358).<br>
It is known that certain substituted ∆3-dihydrofuran-2-one derivatives have herbicidal properties (cf. DE-A-4 014 420). The synthesis of the tetronic acid derivatives used as starting compounds (such as, for example, 3-(2-methyl-phenyl)-4-hydroxy-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-∆ 3-dihydrofuran-2-one) is also described in DE-A-4 014 420. Compounds of a similar structure are known from the publication Campbell et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1985, (8) 1567-76, but no mention is made of insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity. 3-Aryl-∆3-dihydrofuranone derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal<br>
Le A 31 023-Foreign countries<br><br>
and insecticidal properties are furthermore known from EP-A-528 156, but the action described in this publication is not always sufficient. Thiotetronic acids are known from WO 95/26345.<br>
Furthermore, certain 3H-pyrazole-3-one derivatives, such as, for example, 1,2-diethyl-1,2-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-phenyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one or {[5-oxo-l ,2-diphenyl-4-(p-sulphophenyl)-3-pyrazolin-3-yl]-oxy}-disodium salt or p-(3-hydroxy-5-oxo-l,2-diphenyl-3-pyrazolin-4-yl)-benzenesulphonic acid are known from the literature (cf. J. Heterocycl. Chem., 25(5), 1301-1305, 1988 or J. Heterocycl. Chem. 25(5), 1307-1310, 1988 or Zh. Obshch. Khim., 34(7), 2397-2402, 1964). However, a biological action of these compounds is not described.<br>
It is furthermore known that the trisodium salt of 4,4',4"-(5-hydroxy-3-oxo-lH-pyrazol-l,2,4(3H)-triyl)-tris-benzenesulphonic acid has pharmacological properties (cf. Farmakol. Toksikol. (Moscow), 38(2), 180-186, 1976). However, its use in plant protection is not known.<br>
Moreover, 4-arylpyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are described in EP-A-508 126 and in WO 92/16 510.<br>
Certain phenyl-pyrone derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been described (cf. A.M. Chirazi, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, Arch. Pharm. 309, 558 (1976) and K.-H. Boltze and K. Heidenbluth, Chem. Ber. 91., 2849), a potential use of these compounds as pesticides not being indicated. Phenyl-pyrone derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are described in EP-A-588 137.<br>
Certain 5-phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been described (cf. E. Ziegler and E. Steiner, Monatsh. 95, 147 (1964), R. Ketcham, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 10, 223 (1973)), a potential use of these compounds as pesticides not being indicated. 5-Phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have a herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal action are described in WO 94/14 785.<br><br>
However, the activity and spectrum of action of these compounds are not always entirely satisfactory, in particular at low application rates and concentrations. Furthermore, the tolerance, by plants, of the known compounds is not always sufficient.<br>
There have now been found new compounds of the formula (I)<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The compounds are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total combating of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths and squares with or without tree plantings. Equally, the compounds can be employed for combating weeds in perennial cultures, for example afforestations, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hopfields, in lawns, turf and pasture-land, and for the selective combating of weeds in annual cultures.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are highly suitable for selectively combating monocotyledon weeds in dicotyledon cultures by the pre- and post-<br><br>
emergence method. For example they can be employed very successfully for combating grass weeds in cotton or sugar beet.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents, and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as well as water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol<br><br>
ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates as well as albumen hydrolysis products; as dispersing agents there are suitable: for example lignin sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound according to the invention can be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances or herbicides.

bristletails, such as Lepisma saccharina.<br>
Industrial materials are to be listed as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and derived timber products, and paints.<br>
The material to be protected against attack by insects is very particularly preferably wood and derived timber products.<br><br>
Wood and derived timber products which can be protected by the agent according to the invention or by compositions comprising it are to be understood as meaning, for example, construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood laggings, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's work, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in construction or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The abovementioned formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellant, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers, and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments, and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount used can be determined in each case upon use by test series. However, in general it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound based on the material to be protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
The organochemical solvents employed are preferably oily or oil-like solvents with an<br><br>
evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-type solvents of low volatility which are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral-oil-comprising solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
It is advantageous to use mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling point of 250 to 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of a boiling range of 160 to 280°C, spirit of turpentine and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the substances used are liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably cc-monochloronaphthalene.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility with an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably 45°C, can be replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organo-chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
Organochemical binders which are used within the scope of the present invention are the binding drying oils and/or synthetic resins which are known per se, can be diluted with water and/or are soluble, dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or<br><br>
polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Substances which can also be used as binders are bitumen or bituminous substances in amounts of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellants, odoriferous substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives which are known per se can be employed, inter alia.<br>
The composition or concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Substances which are preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds or crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate, phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Another suitable solvent or diluent is, in particular, water, if appropriate in a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents,<br><br>
•emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
A particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by means of industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example vacuum, double-vaccum or pressure processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can comprise other insecticides and, if appropriate, one or more other fungicides.<br>

'Example 10<br>
Test with resistant Boophilus microplus / SP resistant Parkhurst strain<br>
Test animals:	Female adults which have sucked themselves full<br>
Solvent:	Dimethyl sulphoxide<br>
20 mg of active compound are dissolved in 1 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide, and lesser concentrations are prepared by dilution with the same solvent.<br>
The test is carried out in 5 applications. 1 ul of the solutions is injected into the abdomen, and the animals are transferred into dishes and kept in a controlled-environment cabinet. The activity is determined via the inhibition of oviposition. 100% means that no tick has produced eggs.<br>
In this test, an activity of 100% was shown, for example, by the compounds of Preparation Examples (I-2-b-5), (I-2-a-6), (I-l-b-3) and (I-l-a-5) at an exemplary active compound concentration of 20 jag/animal.<br>
Example 11<br>
Test with fly larvae /development-inhibitory action<br>
Test animals:	All larval stages of Lucilia cuprina (OP-resistant)<br>
[Pupae and adults (without contact with active compound)]<br>
Solvent:	35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
Emulsifier:	35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are mixed with 7 parts of the abovementioned solvent/emulsifier mixture, and the resulting emulsion concentrate is diluted with water to the concentration desired in each case.<br>
For each concentration, 30 to 50 larvae are transferred to horsemeat (1 cm3) located in glass tubes and 500 ul of the test dilution are pipetted onto the meat. The glass tubes are placed into plastic beakers whose bottom is covered with sea sand and kept in a control-environment cabinet (26°C ± 1.5°C, 70% relative humidity ± 10%). The activity is checked after 24 hours and 48 hours (larvicidal action). After the larvae have left the glass tubes (approximately 72 hours), the tubes are removed, and perforated plastic lids are placed on the beakers. After 1 '/z times the development period (hatching of the control flies), the hatched flies and the pupae/puparia are counted.<br>
The criterion for the action is death in the treated larvae after 48 hours (larvicidal effect) or inhibition of adults hatching from the pupae or inhibition of pupation. The criterion for the in-vitro action of a substance is the inhibition of fly development or a standstill of development prior to the adult stage. 100% larvicidal activity means that all larvae have died after 48 hours. 100% development-inhibitory activity means that no adult flies have hatched.<br>
In this test, an activity of 100% was shown, for example, by the compounds of Preparation Examples (I-2-b-5), (I-2-a-6), (I-l-b-3) and (I-l-a-5) at an exemplary active compound concentration of 1000 ppm.<br><br><br><br><br>
