				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[OOOl] The present invention relates to an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst.   More specifically,  it relates to an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst which is good in terms of the catalytic ignitability. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] As the concerns over the environmental issues have been growing recently, the measures against exhaust gases emitted from internal combustion engines such as automobile engines have been taken seriously. It is because problems such as pollution and environmental deterioration have occurred when exhaust gases emitted from internal combustion engines are emitted into the atmosphere as they are. Hence, the exhaust gases are emitted into the atmosphere after they are purified by exhaust-gas purifying catalysts .<br>
[0003] Exhaust-gas purifying systems using exhaust-gas purifying catalysts have been employed widely, because they can reduce the exhaust-gas emission remarkably, compared with the other measures, without applying so much load to internal combustion engines, such as automobile engines, which emit exhaust gases.<br>
[0004] In general, exhaust-gas purifying catalysts are made in the following manner. A porous loading layer is formed on a surface of a catalyst support substrate which exhibits heat resistance. The<br>
loading layer is composed of heat-resistant inorganic oxides, such &gt;<br>
as alumina.  A catalytic ingredient is loaded on the loading layer. The exhaust-gas purifying catalysts convert nitrogen oxides (NOX) ,<br>
hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO), which are contained in exhaust gases, into unharmful nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water, respectively, by the action of catalytic ingredients.<br>
[0005] It has been known that the exhaust-gas purifying performance of catalytic ingredients is affected strongly by temperature. In general, when purifying exhaust gases with catalytic ingredients, the purification has been carried out at a temperature of 300 °C or more. Accordingly, when the temperature of exhaust gases is low, such as immediately after starting automotive engines, the catalytic activity of catalytic ingredients is so low that it has been difficult to purify exhaust gases satisfactorily.<br>
[0006] As a method for improving the purifying performance and<br>
ignition performance of exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, it has been<br>
t known to increase the loading amount of catalytic ingredients.<br>
Moreover, as a method of upgrading the ignition performance of exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, a method is available which uses a plurality of catalyst support substrates. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 6-99,076 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 6-205,983 disclose such exhaust-gas purifying catalysts.<br>
[0007] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 6-99,076 discloses a metallic support catalyst. The metallic catalyst comprises two catalyst support substrates, a loading layer, and Pt and Rh. The catalyst support substrates are fastened so as to be separated at an interval. The loading layer is formed on a surface of the respective catalyst support substrates. The Pt and Rh are loaded on the loading layer in an amount of 1.0 g and 0.2 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the catalyst support<br>
substrates, respectively.<br>
[0008]  Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 6-205, 983 discloses an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst which comprises two catalyst support substrates, a loading layer, and Pt and Rh. Similarly, the catalyst support substrates are fastened so as to be separated at an interval. The loading layer is formed on a surface of the respective catalyst support substrates.  The Pt and Rh are loaded on the loading layer.  However, the exhaust-gas purifying catalyst is characterized in that one of the catalytic ingredients, Pt, is loaded in a greater loading amount on an upstream side of the respective loading layers.  For example, in the exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, the Pt and Rh are loaded on an upstream portion of the loading layer formed on the upstream-side catalyst support substrate in an amount of 10.0 g and 0.3 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the upstream-side catalyst support substrate, respectively; and the Pt and Rh are loaded on the other portion of the loading layer formed on the upstream-side catalyst support substrate in an amount of 1.5 g and 0.3 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the upstream-side catalyst support substrate, respectively. Moreover, the Pt and Rh are loaded on the loading layer formed on the downstream-side catalyst support substrate in an amount of 10.0 g and 0.3 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume  the  downstream-side  catalyst   support   substrate, respectively.<br>
[0009] Note that it has been required for conventional exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, involving the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts disclosed in the aforementioned patent publications, to exhibit furthermore enhanced performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THF. INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention has been developed in view of the aforementioned circumstances. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst which has such good ignition performance that it exhibits effective purifying activity even in a low temperature region, such as immediately after automotive engines are started.<br>
[OOll] The inventors of the present invention studied exhaust-gas purifying catalysts over and over again. As a result, they found out that it is possible to achieve the object when rhodium (Rh), one of catalytic ingredients, is loaded more on an inlet side of exhaust-gas purifying catalysts with respect to a flow of exhaust gases. Thus, they completed the present invention.<br>
[0012] For example, an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to the present invention comprises: a mantle;<br>
two or more honeycomb-shaped supports fastened in the mantle so as to be separated at intervals, and comprising a first honeycomb-shaped support disposed on a most upstream side of the mantle with respect to a flow of exhaust gases and a second honeycomb-shaped support disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support on a downstream side of the mantle with respect to the flow of exhaust gases; and<br>
a catalytic layer disposed on a surface of the respective honeycomb-shaped supports, and comprising a loading layer formed on a surface of the respective honeycomb-shaped supports and a catalytic ingredient loaded on the loading layer, the catalytic layer disposed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support<br>
including at least rhodium (Rh) as the catalytic ingredient in a loading amount of 0.8 g or more with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0013] The present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst comprises the catalytic layer which is disposed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support and which includes Rh loaded in an amount of 0.8 g or more with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support. Therefore, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst effects advantages that it exhibits not only good purifying performance but also upgraded ignition performance. Moreover, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can be produced with a reduced loading amount of catalytic ingredient, because Rh gives exhaust-gas purifying catalysts better ignition performance with a less loading amount than platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) do.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018] Having generally described the present invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to the specific preferred embodiments which are provided herein for the purpose of illustration only and not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims.<br>
[0019] The present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst comprises a mantle, two or more honeycomb-shaped supports, and a catalytic layer.<br>
[0020] In the mantle, that is, in the axial hollow of the mantle, the two or more honeycomb-shaped supports are fastened. Moreover, exhaust gases flow through the inside of the mantle. The mantel can be composed of metals. As for the metals forming the mantle, it is possible to use heat-resistant metals which have been used in conventionally known pipe-shaped catalysts.   As for the heat-resistant metals, it is possible to name stainless steel, for instance.<br>
[0021] The two or more honeycomb-shaped supports are fastened in the mantle so as to be separated at intervals. The honeycomb-shaped supports comprise a large number of cells which communicate one of the opposite ends of the honeycomb-shaped supports with the other one of them axially. The honeycomb-shaped supports are disposed in the mantle so that the extension direction of cells coincides<br>
with the axial direction of the mantle. The present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst comprises two or more independent component catalysts disposed in the mantle,  because the two or more honeycomb-shaped supports are fastened in the mantle so as to be separated at intervals.  As a result, one of the independent component catalysts, an independent component catalyst which is disposed on a most upstream side of the mantle with respect to a flow of exhaust gases, upgrades the ignition performance of the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst.  The honeycomb-shaped supports can be composed of metals. The honeycomb-shaped supports composed of metals enable the temperature of the respective independent component catalysts to rise quickly. As for the metals forming the honeycomb-shaped supports, it is possible to use heat-resistant metals.  As for the heat-resistant metals, it is possible to name stainless steel, for instance. [ 0022 ]  The catalytic layer is disposed on a surface of the respective honeycomb-shaped supports, and comprises a loading layer and a catalytic ingredient. The loading layer is formed on a surface of the respective honeycomb-shaped supports.   The catalytic ingredient is loaded on the loading layer.  The catalytic layer purifies exhaust gases upon contacting with them.  The catalytic layer can comprise the same loading layer and catalytic ingredient as those of conventionally known exhaust-gas purifying catalysts. For example, as for the loading layer, it is possible to use loading layers formed of heat-resistant inorganic oxides, such as alumina. Note that the loading layer can further comprise conventionally known additives, such as ceria and zirconia, dispersed therein. As for the catalytic ingredient, it is possible to use Pt, Pd or Rh.<br>
[0023] The two or more honeycomb-shaped supports comprise a first honeycomb-shaped support, and a second honeycomb-shaped support. The first honeycomb-shaped support is disposed on a most upstream side of the mantle with respect to a flow of exhaust gases. The second honeycomb-shaped support is disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support on a downstream side of the mantle with respect to the flow of exhaust gases.  In the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, the catalytic layer disposed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support (hereinafter referred to as "most-upstream-side  catalytic  layer"  wherever  appropriate) includes at least Rh as the catalytic ingredient in a loading amount of 0.8 g or more with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support. On the other hand, in conventional exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, the catalytic layer usually includes Rh in a loading amount of from 0.2 to 0.4 g approximately with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the support.  In the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, Rh is loaded in an amount of 0.8 g or more with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support, a loading amount far greater than the conventional loading amount.  In the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, a first independent component catalyst formed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support is upgraded in terms of the ignition performance and purifying performance, because the most-upstream-side catalytic layer includes Rh abundantly. Note that Rh produces better ignition performance with a less loading amount than Pt and Fd do. Thus, Rh gives the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst the advantage better with reduced noble metal consumption than both Pt and Pd are used.  The most-upstream-side<br>
catalytic layer can preferably includes Rh in a loading amount of from 1 to 5 g, further preferably from 1.5 to 3 g, with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0024] In the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, the two or more honeycomb-shaped supports are fastened in the mantle, and the catalytic layer is formed on the respective honeycomb-shaped supports. That is, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst comprises two or more independent component catalysts. Thus, in the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst, the quantity of independent component catalysts can be two or more. However, the quantity of independent component catalysts can preferably be no more than two, because the more the quantity of independent component catalysts is the higher the production cost goes up.<br>
[0025] The most-upstream-side catalytic layer can preferably further include one or more catalytic ingredients loaded thereon, in addition to Rh. The loading amount of catalytic ingredients other than Rh is not limited in particular. The loading amount can be arranged to such amounts that the catalytic ingredients other than Rh are loaded on conventional exhaust-gas purifying catalysts. For example, Pt and Pd can be loaded on the most-upstream-side catalytic layer in an amount of from 0.5 to 2.0 g and from 0.5 to 2.0 g, respectively, with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0026] The catalytic layer, disposed on a surface of each of the other honeycomb-shaped supports of the two or more honeycomb-shaped supports (i.e., the two or more honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support), can preferably include one or more catalytic ingredients loaded thereon. The loading amount of<br>
catalytic ingredients is not limited in particular. However, when loading Rh on the catalytic layer disposed on a surface of each of the honeycomb-shaped supports other than the first honeycomb-shaped support, the Rh loading amount can preferably be arranged so that it is less than the Rh loading amount on the catalytic layer disposed on the first honeycomb-shaped support.  For example, the catalytic layer disposed on the surface of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support can preferably include Rh as the catalytic ingredient in a loading amount less than that of the catalytic layer disposed on the first honeycomb-shaped support by a factor of from 0.1 to 0.7, further preferably from 0.4 to 0.6.  Moreover, when the quantity of the honeycomb-shaped catalysts excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support is more than two, it is possible to appropriately change the loading amount of the catalytic ingredient on each of the catalytic layers, disposed on  the  honeycomb-shaped  catalysts  excepting  the  first honeycomb-shaped support, respectively.  In addition, the loading amount of the catalytic ingredient on the catalytic layer, disposed on a surface of each of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support, can be arranged to such an amount that the catalytic ingredient is loaded on conventional exhaust-gas purifying catalysts.  For example, Pt, Pd and Rh can be loaded on the catalytic layer, disposed on a surface of each of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support, in an amount of from 0.5 to 2.0 g, from 0.5 to 2.0 g, and from 0.2 to 0.5 g, respectively, with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of each of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0027] In general, the more the catalytic ingredient is loaded the more the resulting catalyst is enhanced in terms of the exhaust-gas purifying performance. However, the production cost has gone up remarkably.<br>
[0028] The first honeycomb-shaped support can preferably have an axial length of from 10 to 30 mm. When the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support is 30 mm or less, the first independent component catalyst is upgraded in terms of the ignition performance. That is, the temperature increment rate of the first honeycomb support and that of the most-upstream-side catalytic layer surge when the first honeycomb-shaped support is shortened axially. On the other hand,  lengthening the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support results in a sharp increase in the production cost when loading Rh on the most-upstream-side catalytic layer. The shorter the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support the more preferable it is in view of the ignition performance. However, when the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support is less than 10 mm, the exhaust-gas blow-by (or exhaust-gas leakage) has occurred to degrade the ignition performance of resulting exhaust-gas purifying catalysts. Moreover, when the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support is less than 10 mm, it is difficult to manufacture such honeycomb-shaped supports.  Note that the axial length of the first honeycomb-shaped support can further preferably be from 15 to 25 mm.<br>
[0029] A summed axial length of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the first honeycomb-shaped support can preferably be longer than that of the first honeycori-shaped support. When a summed axial length of the honeycomb-shaped supports excepting the<br>
first honeycomb-shaped substrate is longer than that of the first honeycomb-shaped substrate, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst has a catalytic layer with a sufficient length as a whole so that it can secure satisfactory exhaust-gas purifying performance.<br>
[0030] An axial length of the second honeycomb-shaped support disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support can preferably be longer than that of the first honeycomb-shaped support. When the axial length of the second honeycomb-shaped support is longer than that of the first honeycomb-shaped support, the independent component catalyst formed on the second honeycomb-shaped support comprises the catalytic layer whose axial length is longer than that of the catalytic layer of the first independent component catalyst formed on the first honeycomb-shaped support. Thus, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can show enhanced exhaust-gas purifying performance. Note that the axial length of the second honeycomb-shaped support disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support can further preferably be longer than that of the first honeycomb-shaped support by from 20 to 150 mm, furthermore preferably from 40 to 120 mm.<br>
[0031] The interval between the first honeycomb-shaped support and the second honeycomb-shaped support disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support can preferably fall in a range of from 5 to 50 mm. When the interval between the first honeycomb-shaped support and the second honeycomb-shaped support falls in the range, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can show not only high ignition performance but also upgraded exhaust-gas purifying performance. When the interval between the first honeycomb-shaped<br>
support and the second honeycomb-shaped support is less than 5 nun, the two independent component catalysts formed on the two honeycomb-shaped supports are disposed so closely that the turbulence of exhaust gases are less likely to occur between the two independent component catalysts.  Accordingly, the overall exhaust-gas purifying efficiency might degrade. On the other hand, when the interval between the first honeycomb-shaped support and the second honeycomb-shaped support is more than 50 mm, the second independent component catalyst formed on the second honeycomb-shaped support is separated so away from the first independent component catalyst formed on the first honeycomb-shaped support that the second independent component catalyst might not utilize the enhanced ignition performance, the advantage produced by the first independent component catalyst, effectively.  Consequently, the effective performance as an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst might degrade as a whole. Moreover, when the interval between the first honeycomb-shaped support and the second honeycomb-shaped support is too long,  the resulting exhaust-gas purifying catalysts themselves become so long that their boardability onto vehicles might deteriorate.  The interval between the first honeycomb-shaped support and the second honeycomb-shaped support disposed next to the first honeycomb-shaped support can further preferably fall in a range of from 10 to 30 mm.<br>
[0032] The present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can be arranged in the same manner as conventionally known exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, except that two or more independent component catalysts are formed in a mantle; and that one of the independent component catalysts, disposed on a first honeycomb-shaped support positioned<br>
on a most upstream side of the mantle with respect to a flow of exhaust gases, includes Rh as a catalytic ingredient in a loading amount of 0.8 g or more with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0033] The production process of the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst is not limited in particular. However, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can be produced in the following manner, for example.<br>
[0034] A honeycomb-shaped support can be manufactured in the following manner, for instance. A corrugated sheet is formed by bending a strip-shaped metallic sheet. The resulting corrugated sheet is laminated with a strip-shaped flat metallic sheet. The laminated corrugated sheet and flat sheet are wound as a roll. The wound laminate is cut perpendicularly to the axial direction to a predetermined axial length.<br>
[0035] After manufacturing two or more of the honeycomb-shaped supports, the resultant honeycomb-shaped supports are fitted into a mantle. The mantle comprises a pipe which has been cut to a predetermined axial length in advance. Then, the honeycomb-shaped supports are fastened in the mantle by brazing.<br>
[0036] Thereafter, a slurry for forming a loading layer is coated on a surface of the honeycomb-shaped supports which are fastened in the mantle. After drying and calcining the slurry, a catalytic ingredient comprising Rh is loaded on the resulting loading layer in the same manner as conventional exhaust-gas purifying catalysts.<br>
[0037] Thus, in accordance with the above-described production<br>
process, it is possible to produce the present exhaust-gas purifying<br>
catalyst.	Examples<br>
[0038] Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to specific examples.<br>
[ 0039 ] As examples of the present invention, the following exhaust-gas purifying catalysts were produced as hereinafter described.<br>
(Example No. 1)<br>
[0040] First of all, a circle-shaped continuous pipe was prepared which was composed of SUS436L as per Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) . The pipe had a thickness of 1.5 mm, an inside diameter of 50.5 mm, and an outside diameter of 53.5 mm. The pipe was cut to an axial length of 140 mm to manufacture a mantle.<br>
[004l] Subsequently, a cylindrical upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was manufactured which was composed of a high heat-resistance stainless steel. The high heat-resistance stainless steel comprised 20% by weight of Cr, 5% by weight of Al, and the balance of Fe and inevitable impurities. The upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support comprised cells in an amount of 31 cells/cm2<br>
(or 200 cells/inch2 approximately), and had a diameter of 50.5 mm and an axial length of 20 mm. Note that the present first honeycomb-shaped support includes the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0042] Moreover, a cylindrical downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was likewise manufactured which was composed of the high heat-resistance stainless steel. The downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support comprised cells in an amount of 31 cells/cm2<br>
(or 200 cells/inch2 approximately), and had a diameter of 50.5 mm<br>
and an axial length of 100 mm.  Note that the present second<br>
honeycomb-shaped   support   includes   the   downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0043] Note that the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support and the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support were manufactured in the following manner. Two strip-shaped sheets were prepared whose thickness was 100 jum, and were processed into a flat sheet and a corrugated sheet, respectively. The flat sheet and the corrugated sheet were laminated. Then, the laminated flat sheet and corrugated sheet were wound as a roll to manufacture the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support and downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0044] Then, the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was fitted into the mantle through one of the opposite-end openings of the mantle (hereinafter referred to as a "front-end opposite opening") . Note that the front-end opposite surface of the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was flush with the front-end opposite surface of the mantle when completing the fitting of the upstream-side honeyccmb-shaped support into the mantle. Moreover, the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was fitted into the mantle through the other one of the opposite-end openings of the mantle (hereinafter referred to as a "rear-end opposite opening") . Note that the rear-end opposite surface of the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was flush with the rear-end opposite surface of the mantle when completing the fitting of the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support into the mantle.<br>
[0045] Thereafter, -he upstream-side and downstream honeycomb-shaped supports were fastened in the mantle by brazing in the following manner. The fastening by brazing was carried out using<br>
a heat-resistant Ni-based brazing alloy. After applying the heat-resistant Ni-brazing alloy onto an inner peripheral surface of the mantle and onto an outer peripheral surface of the upstream-side and downstream honeycomb-shaped supports, the mantle into which the upstream-side and downstream-side honeycomb-shaped supports were fitted was heated to a high temperature and held thereat in a vacuum atmosphere. Note that the used brazing alloy comprised Cr in an amount of 18% by weight, Si in an amount of 10% by weight, and the balance of Ni and inevitable impurities.<br>

50\ 5 mm, and an outside diameter of 53.5 mm. The pipe was cut to an axial length of 140 mm to manufacture a mantle.<br>
[0066] Subsequently, a cylindrical upstream-side honeycomb support was manufactured which was composed of the above-described high heat-resistance stainless steel. The upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support comprised cells in an amount of 31 cells/cm2 (or 200 cells/inch2 approximately), and had a diameter of 50.5 mm and an axial length of 20 mm. Note that the present first honeycomb-shaped support includes the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0067] Moreover, a cylindrical intermediate honeycomb-shaped support was likewise manufactured which was composed of the high heat-resistance stainless steel.

[0069] Then, the intermediate honeycomb-shaped support was fitted into the mantle through one of the opposite-end openings of the mantle (hereinafter referred to as a "front-end opposite opening") . Note that the intermediate honeycomb-shaped support was fitted into the mantle until the front-end opposite surface of the intermediate<br><br>
hdneycomb-shaped support was positioned away from the front-end opposite surface of the mantle by a distance of 40 mm. Moreover, the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support was fitted into the mantle through the front-end opposite opening.

of 1. 6 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support. That is, Pt was loaded on the upstream-side loading layer in a total loading amount of 2.4 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0098] In accordance with the above-described procedures, an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to Comparative Example No. 3 was produced.<br>
[0099] The exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to Comparative Example No. 3 comprised the mantle, the upstream-side catalyst, and the downstream-side catalyst.  The upstream-side catalyst was disposed in the mantle on an upstream side with respect to a flow of exhaust gases; and the downstream-side catalyst was disposed at a position where the upstream-end surface of the downstream-side catalyst was positioned away from the downstream-end surface of the upstream-side catalyst at an interval of 20 mm.  Note that the upstream-end surface of the upstream-side catalyst agreed with the upstream-end surface of the mantle; and the downstream-end surface of the downstream-side catalyst agreed with the downstream-end surface of the mantle.  Moreover, the upstream-side catalyst comprised the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support fastened to the mantle, and the upstream-side catalytic layer formed on a surface of  the  upstream-side  honeycomb-shaped  support;  and  the downstream-side   catalyst   comprised   the   downstream-side honeycomb-shaped  support  fastened  to  the  mantle,  and  the downstream-side catalytic layer formed on a surface of the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support.   In addition,  the upstream-side catalytic layer comprised the upstream-side loading<br><br>
layer formed on a surface of the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support, and Pt and Rh loaded on the upstream-side loading layer; and the downstream-side catalytic layer comprised the downstream-side loading layer formed on a surface of the downstream-side honeycomb-shaped support, and Pt and Rh loaded on the downstream-side loading layer. Note that Pt and Rh were loaded on the upstream-side loading layer in a loading amount of 2.4 g and 0.16 g with respect to 1 L of an apparent volume of the upstream-side honeycomb-shaped support, respectively.<br>
[OlOO] Table 1 above summarizes the arrangement of the exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to Comparative Example No. 3 as well.<br>
(Assessment)<br>
[OlOl] The exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 and Comparative Example Nos. 1 through 3 were examined for the ignition performance and the purifying performance.<br>
[0102] Firstly, the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 and Comparative Example Nos. 1 through 3 were assembled with an exhaust system of an automotive engine testing bench equipped with an engine whose displacement was 2,000 c.c., respectively. Then, the engine was started to subject the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts to a durability test for 100 hours while running the engine at a revolving speed of 5, 000 rpm and setting the inlet exhaust-gas temperature at 800 °C.<br>
[0103] The respective exhaust-gas purifying catalysts, which had been subjected to the durability test, were mounted on an exhaust system of an actual vehicle (e.g., a two-wheeled vehicle) equipped with a 4-stroke engine whose displacement was 0.4 L. The engine was driven under the running conditions prescribed in ECE40 (or<br>
[(06460), and exhaust gases emitted from the engine were passed through the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts. Simultaneously with starting the engine, the bag sampling was started in which the exhaust gases, which had passed through the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts and had been emitted therefrom, were collected. Note that the bag sampling was carried out in the following manner. The exhaust gases were collected with the first bag in the first and second cycles of the ECE40 mode; and they were collected with the second bag in the third through sixth cycles thereof. The CO contents of the exhaust gases, which were collected in the first and second bags, that is, the CO emission values were measured. Table 2 below and Fig. 3 show the measurement results.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0104] When comparing the CO emission values in the exhaust gases collected in the first bags, as can be appreciated from Table 2 and Fig. 3, the CO emission values in the exhaust gases emitted from the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 were remarkably smaller values than the CO emission values in the exhaust gases emitted from the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Comparative Example Nos. 1 through 3. Note that a smaller CO emission value in exhaust gases collected in the<br>
first bag indicates that an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst is better in terms of the ignition performance, because the first bag collects exhaust gases emitted from engines upon or immediately after starting the engines. Therefore, it is understood that the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 exhibited better ignition performance.<br>
[0105] Moreover, when comparing the CO emission values in the exhaust gases collected in the second bags, the comparison results were similar to those relating to the first bags. Specifically, the CO emission values in the exhaust gases emitted from the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 were remarkably smaller values than the CO emission values in the exhaust gases emitted from the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Comparative Example Nos. 1 through 3. Note that a small CO emission value in exhaust gases collected in the second bag indicates that an exhaust-gas purifying catalyst is better in terms of the purifying performance, because the second bag collects exhaust gases emitted from engines in the third through sixth cycles of the ECE40 mode, that is, after the ignition. Therefore, it is understood that the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 exhibited better exhaust-gas purifying performance.<br>
[0106] Note that the exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to Example No. 4 is an example which comprises two honeycomb-shaped supports in addition to the first honeycomb-shaped support recited in the accompanying claims according to the present invention. The exhaust-gas purifying catalyst according to Example No. 4 likewise exhibited enhanced ignition performance and purifying performance,<br>
Because the most-upstream-side catalytic layer, which was disposed on the most upstream side of the exhaust-gas purifying catalyst with respect to the flow of exhaust gases, comprised Rh in a sufficient loading amount. Note that the present catalytic layer, disposed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support, includes the most-upstream-side catalytic layer. The fact implies that, as far as an adequate amount of Rh is loaded on the catalytic layer disposed on a surface of the first honeycomb-shaped support, the present exhaust-gas purifying catalyst can show upgraded ignition performance and purifying performance even when it comprises two or more honeycomb-shaped supports in addition to the first honeycomb-shaped support.<br>
[0107] Thus, the exhaust-gas purifying catalysts according to Example Nos. 1 through 4 were good in terms of the ignition performance and purifying performance.<br>
[O108] Having now fully described the present invention, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as set forth herein including the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
