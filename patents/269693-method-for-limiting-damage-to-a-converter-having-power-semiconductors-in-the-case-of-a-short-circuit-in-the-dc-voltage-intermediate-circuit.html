				<td>Description<br>
Method for limiting damage to a converter having power<br>
semiconductors in the case of a short circuit in the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit.<br>
The invention relates to a device for converting an electric<br>
current comprising at least one phase module having an AC<br>
voltage connection and at least one DC voltage connection,<br>
connected to a DC voltage intermediate circuit, and comprising<br>
at least one energy store, wherein a phase module branch is<br>
formed between each DC voltage connection and each AC voltage<br>
connection, and wherein each phase module branch has a series<br>
circuit formed by submodules each having at least one power<br>
semiconductor, wherein semiconductor protective means connected<br>
in parallel with one of the power semiconductors of each<br>
submodule and a control unit for driving the semiconductor<br>
protective means are provided and the energy store or energy<br>
stores is/are designed for supplying energy to the control<br>
unit.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for limiting<br>
damage to a converter having power semiconductors, said<br>
converter being connected to at least one further converter or<br>
at least one electrical machine via a DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit affected by a short circuit.<br>
The device of the generic type is already known from DE 103 23<br>
220 Al, which discloses a so-called multiterminal converter for<br>
connection to an energy-feeding three-phase supply system. The<br>
previously known converter has phase modules, the number of<br>
which corresponds to the number of supply system phases to be<br>
connected. Each phase module has one AC voltage connection and<br>
two<br><br>
DC voltage connections, wherein the DC voltage connections of<br>
the phase modules are connected to a DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit. Phase module branches extend between each AC voltage<br>
connection and each DC voltage connection, wherein each phase<br>
module branch comprises a series circuit of submodules. Each<br>
submodule has a dedicated energy store connected in parallel<br>
with a power semiconductor circuit. The power semiconductor<br>
circuit has turn-off power semiconductors, such as IGBTs, GTOs<br>
or the like, with each of which a respective freewheeling diode<br>
is reverse-connected in parallel. If a short circuit is present<br>
in the DC voltage circuit, the energy stores of the respective<br>
submodule are discharged. In order to avoid destruction of the<br>
power semiconductors of the submodules, each power<br>
semiconductor jeopardized by a short circuit in the DC voltage<br>
circuit has connected in parallel with it a semiconductor<br>
protective means, e.g. a thyristor, which is triggered in the<br>
case of a short circuit and subsequently carries a large part<br>
of the short-circuit current. What is disadvantageous about the<br>
previously known solution is that the triggering unit that<br>
triggers the thyristor is supplied with energy by the energy<br>
store of the submodules. Although this obviates a separate<br>
energy supply of the triggering units, the energy stores of the<br>
submodules are not yet charged when the converter is connected<br>
to the three-phase system, with the result that a triggering of<br>
the thyristors is impossible. Consequently, when the supply<br>
system is connected in, destruction of the power semiconductors<br>
of the previously known converter cannot be ruled out if a<br>
short circuit is present in the DC voltage circuit.<br>
It is an object of the invention therefore, to disclose a<br>
device and a method of the type mentioned in the introduction<br>
wherein damage on account of a short circuit present<br><br>
on the DC voltage side is reliably prevented including when the<br>
supply system is connected in.<br>
Proceeding from the device mentioned in the introduction, the<br>
invention achieves this object in that at least one DC voltage<br>
connection of each phase module is connected to the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit via a DC voltage switch.<br>
The invention furthermore achieves said object by means of a<br>
method for limiting damage to a converter having power<br>
semiconductors, said converter being connected to other<br>
converters or other electrical machines via a DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit affected by a short circuit, wherein a<br>
drive unit is supplied with energy by an energy store of the<br>
converter or of the DC voltage intermediate circuit, the drive<br>
unit ascertains a short circuit and subsequently drives at<br>
least one semiconductor protective means connected in parallel<br>
with a power semiconductor, such that a short-circuit current<br>
flows both via the semiconductor protective means and via the<br>
power semiconductor connected in parallel therewith, wherein<br>
each energy store is charged before the converter is connected<br>
to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.<br>
According to the invention, each energy store of the device is<br>
firstly charged before the AC voltage system is switched on or<br>
connected in, and is connected to the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit only after the charging of the energy stores.<br>
In order to prevent the current flow in the case of a short<br>
circuit, the device according to the invention expediently has<br>
a DC voltage switch, via which at least one DC voltage<br>
connection of each phase module is connected to the<br><br>
DC voltage circuit. The DC voltage switch has a disconnected<br>
position, in which a current flow via the DC voltage switch is<br>
prevented, and a contact position, in which a current flow via<br>
the DC voltage switch is enabled. If the DC voltage switch is<br>
in its disconnected position, therefore, each energy store of<br>
the DC voltage intermediate circuit or each energy store of<br>
each submodule can firstly be charged. After the charging of<br>
the energy stores, the AC voltage system is disconnected again<br>
from the converter. Only then is the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit connected by means of a DC voltage switch being<br>
transferred to its contact position, wherein, in the case of a<br>
short circuit in the DC voltage intermediate circuit and after<br>
the AC voltage system has been connected in again, the charged<br>
energy stores provide the energy necessary for triggering the<br>
one or more semiconductor protective means. The DC voltage<br>
switch is advantageously a mechanical disconnecting switch.<br>
Advantageously, each AC voltage connection is connected to a<br>
supply system via an AC voltage switch. The AC voltage switch<br>
enables the supply system to be connected in particularly<br>
simply, wherein the AC voltage switch likewise has two switch<br>
positions, namely a disconnected position and a contact<br>
position. The supply system is connected to the converter by<br>
means of the AC voltage switch being transferred from its<br>
disconnected position to its contact position, such that the<br>
energy store or energy stores is or are charged with the DC<br>
voltage switch "open". The AC voltage switch is expediently a<br>
mechanical circuit-breaker.<br>
The semiconductor protective means expediently comprise at<br>
least one thyristor. Thyristors can be obtained<br><br>
cost-effectively and have a sufficiently high surge current<br>
strength, such that the affected thyristor, even in the case of<br>
rapidly rising and high short-circuit currents which occur when<br>
the AC voltage system is turned on, in response to a short<br>
circuit in the DC voltage circuit, until the AC voltage switch<br>
is opened again, is not destroyed by the resulting short-<br>
circuit current.<br>
Expediently, each submodule comprises a turn-off power<br>
semiconductor with a freewheeling diode connected in the<br>
opposite sense thereto, wherein each energy store is arranged<br>
in the DC voltage intermediate circuit. Converters having such<br>
a central energy store are used in the field of energy<br>
transmission and distribution. However, in general a high<br>
quantity of energy is stored in the central energy store, and<br>
is released in said case of a short circuit. In the context of<br>
the invention, the arrangement or interconnection of the<br>
central energy store with respect to the DC voltage switch is<br>
provided such that charging or discharging of the energy store<br>
is made possible even with the DC voltage switch open.<br>
Therefore, as viewed from the DC voltage connections of the<br>
phase modules, the DC voltage switch is consequently connected<br>
downstream of the connection terminal of the energy store. In<br>
other words, the central energy store is connected into the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit between the DC voltage connections<br>
of the phase modules and the DC voltage switch in parallel with<br>
the phase modules.<br>
In a departure from this, each submodule has an energy store<br>
and a power semiconductor circuit connected in parallel with<br>
the energy store. Such a device is also referred to as a so-<br>
called multilevel converter since, instead of one central large<br>
energy store, a plurality of smaller<br><br>
energy stores connected in series with one another are<br>
provided, which are in each case connected in parallel with a<br>
power semiconductor switch.<br>
In accordance with an expedient further development in this<br>
respect, the power semiconductor circuit is a full-bridge<br>
circuit. With the aid of the full-bridge circuit it is possible<br>
to impress the capacitor voltage, a so-called zero voltage or<br>
the inverted capacitor voltage on the two connection terminals<br>
of the bipolar submodules which are connected in series.<br>
In a departure from this, the power semiconductor circuit<br>
comprises two turn-off power semiconductors connected in series<br>
with one another, each power semiconductor having a respective<br>
freewheeling diode connected in parallel with it in the<br>
opposite sense. Such a power semiconductor circuit is also<br>
referred to as a so-called Marquardt circuit, which is<br>
disclosed in DE 101 03 031 A1 and which by this reference is<br>
intended to be part of the disclosure given here. In contrast<br>
to the full-bridge circuit, the power semiconductor circuit<br>
according to Marquardt has only two power semiconductors<br>
connected in series with one another, the latter being<br>
connected up to the energy store of the respective submodule in<br>
such a way that either the voltage dropped across the energy<br>
store of the respective submodule is dropped across the two<br>
connection terminals of the submodule, or a zero voltage. An<br>
inversion of the voltage dropped across the energy store at the<br>
submodule terminals is not made possible by the Marquardt<br>
circuit. However, the Marquardt circuit is more cost-effective<br>
than the full-bridge circuit.<br>
In accordance with	an expedient further development of the<br>
method according to	the invention, each power semiconductor is<br>
connected to the DC	voltage intermediate circuit by means of a<br>
DC voltage<br><br>
switch. In this way, by means of mechanical circuit-breakers,<br>
disconnecting switches or the like, or alternatively by means<br>
of electronic switches comprising semiconductors, such as, for<br>
example, thyristors, IGBTs or the like, it is possible to<br>
disconnect the DC voltage intermediate circuit from the<br>
converter. What is essential here is that all the energy stores<br>
are connected to the DC voltage intermediate circuit via the DC<br>
voltage switch.<br>
The converter, the energy stores and the DC voltage switch are<br>
advantageously arranged in a common housing.<br>
Expediently, each DC voltage switch is opened before the<br>
converter is connected to a supply system. With the DC voltage<br>
switch open, the energy stores can be charged in order to<br>
provide the energy necessary for triggering the semiconductor<br>
protective means.<br>
Advantageously, the converter is connected to a supply system<br>
by means of an AC voltage switch. As has already been<br>
explained, this further development of the invention opens up<br>
the highest possible flexibility when charging the energy<br>
stores, a cost-effective solution simultaneously being provided<br>
with the aid of a mechanical switch. However, here as well, an<br>
electronic switch comprising power semiconductors can be<br>
provided instead of a mechanical switch.<br>
Expediently, in order to connect the converter to the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit firstly all the AC voltage<br>
switches and all the DC voltage switches are opened, and<br>
afterward, in order to charge the energy stores, the AC voltage<br>
switch is closed, finally each AC<br><br>
voltage switch is opened after the charging of the energy<br>
stores, the DC voltage switch is closed in order to connect the<br>
converter to the DC voltage intermediate circuit, and, finally,<br>
each AC voltage switch is closed in order to connect the<br>
converter to the AC voltage system provided that no DC short<br>
circuit was able to be detected beforehand. On the basis of<br>
this simple switching sequence, a cost-effective possibility is<br>
provided for charging the energy stores of the device before a<br>
high short-circuit current owing to a short-circuit in the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit driven by the AC voltage system<br>
flows via the power semiconductors of the device, with the<br>
result that a necessary energy is provided for driving<br>
semiconductor protective means.<br>
Further expedient configurations and advantages of the<br>
invention are the subject matter of the following description<br>
of exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures of the drawing, wherein identical<br>
reference symbols refer to identically acting component parts,<br>
and wherein<br>
Figure 1 shows a device in accordance with the prior art,<br>

prior art,<br>

according to the invention,<br>

according to the invention,<br>
Figure 5 shows the device in accordance with figure 3 in<br>
a different switch position,<br><br>

a different switch position,<br>
Figure 7 shows the device in accordance with figures 3<br>
and 5 in a different switch position,<br>
Figure 8 shows the device in accordance with figures 4<br>
and 6 in a different switch position,<br>
Figure 9 shows a device in accordance with figures 4, 6<br>
and 8 in a further switch position.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device 1 in accordance with the prior art. The<br>
previously known device 1 comprises a converter 2 composed of<br>
three phase modules 3a, 3b and 3c. Each phase module 3a, 3b and<br>
3c has one AC voltage connection 31, 32 and 33, respectively,<br>
and two DC voltage connections, which are in each case<br>
designated by p and n. The DC voltage connections p and n<br>
respectively form the poles of a DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4, wherein a central capacitor 5 as an energy store<br>
extends between the two poles p and n in parallel connection.<br>
Phase module branches 6ap, 6bp, 6cp and respectively 6an, 6bn<br>
and 6cn extend between each AC voltage connection 31, 32 and 33<br>
and each DC voltage connection p and respectively n of a phase<br>
module 3a, 3b and respectively 3c. Each of said phase module<br>
branches is composed of a series circuit of submodules 7 which<br>
are constructed identically. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in figure 1, each submodule 7 has a turn-off power<br>
semiconductor 8, for example an IGBT, a GTO or the like, and a<br>
freewheeling diode 9 connected in parallel therewith in the<br>
opposite sense. Furthermore, a thyristor 10 that can be driven<br>
in the case of a short circuit is connected in parallel with<br>
the freewheeling diode 9<br><br>
in the same sense. If a short circuit is present in the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit 4, the short-circuit current<br>
indicated by dashed lines is formed. It can be seen that the<br>
short-circuit current is fed from a supply system 11 - only<br>
indicated schematically - via a transformer 12 for connecting<br>
the device 1 according to the invention to the supply system<br>
11. In this case, in the exemplary embodiment shown, the short-<br>
circuit current flows via the freewheeling diodes 9 of the<br>
submodules and also via the semiconductor protective means 10<br>
connected in parallel with the freewheeling diode 9, that is to<br>
say the triggered thyristor. However, a triggering energy is<br>
necessary for triggering the thyristor, said triggering energy<br>
being provided by the central capacitor 5. The central<br>
capacitor 5 is charged by the supply system 11. If a short<br>
circuit is present in the DC voltage intermediate circuit 4 as<br>
early as when the supply system 11 is connected in for the<br>
first time, the thyristor 10 cannot be transferred to its on-<br>
state position, as shown in figure 1, such that the short-<br>
circuit current established is distributed between both the<br>
freewheeling diode 9 and the thyristor 10. Rather, solely the<br>
freewheeling diode 9 then carries the short-circuit current,<br>
such that the destruction of the submodules 7 and possibly of<br>
the entire converter 2 can occur.<br>
Figure 2 shows a device 1 in accordance with the prior art,<br>
wherein the converter 2 is configured as a so-called multilevel<br>
converter, however. In contrast to the device in accordance<br>
with figure 1, the device in accordance with figure 2 no longer<br>
has a central energy store in the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4. Rather, each submodule 7 comprises a dedicated<br>
energy store 13 in the form of a unipolar capacitor. The<br>
capacitor 13 is connected in parallel with a power<br>
semiconductor circuit 14, which in this case comprises two<br>
turn-off power semiconductors 8, such as, for example, IGBTs,<br>
GTOs or the like, connected in series with one another.<br><br>
Each of said turn-off power semiconductors 8 has a freewheeling<br>
diode 9 connected in parallel with it in the opposite sense. If<br>
a short circuit is present in the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4, a short-circuit current fed from the supply system<br>
11 flows, the path of said short-circuit current being depicted<br>
by dashed lines in figure 2. It can be seen that the short-<br>
circuit current flows via one of the freewheeling diodes 9 of<br>
the power semiconductor circuit. A semiconductor protective<br>
means in the form of a thyristor 10 is connected in parallel<br>
only with this freewheeling diode 9. As a result of the<br>
triggering of the thyristor 10, the short-circuit current flows<br>
both via the thyristor 10 and via said freewheeling diode 9,<br>
wherein the thyristor 10 and the freewheeling diode 9 are<br>
dimensioned in such a way that a sufficiently high current-<br>
carrying capacity is provided in order to withstand the short-<br>
circuit currents that arise. What is disadvantageous here as<br>
well, however, is that the triggering electronics (not<br>
illustrated pictorially) are supplied with energy for<br>
triggering the thyristor 10 by the capacitor 13 of each<br>
submodule 7. Before the supply system 11 is connected, however,<br>
the capacitor 13 is not charged, such that the thyristor 10<br>
cannot be triggered while the supply system 11 is being<br>
connected in. Therefore, if a short circuit is present in the<br>
DC voltage intermediate circuit 4 when the supply system 11 is<br>
connected in, said short circuit flows solely via one of the<br>
freewheeling diodes 9 of the submodules 7, such that the<br>
destruction of said freewheeling diode 9 can occur. Said diode<br>
is generally combined with the turn-off power semiconductor 8<br>
to form a component, however, such that this leads to the<br>
destruction of the entire power semiconductor circuit 14.<br>
Figure 3 shows a device 14 according to the invention, which<br>
device is constructed in a manner corresponding to figure 1,<br><br>
wherein each submodule 7 comprises a turn-off power<br>
semiconductor 8 and a freewheeling diode 9 connected in<br>
parallel therewith in the opposite sense. Each freewheeling<br>
diode 9 has a thyristor 10 connected in parallel with it in the<br><br>
same sense. The DC voltage intermediate circuit 4 again has a<br>
central capacitor 5 between the positive pole p and the<br>
negative pole n of the DC voltage intermediate circuit 4. In<br>
contrast to the previously known device in accordance with<br>
figure 1, the exemplary embodiment according to the invention<br>
in accordance with figure 3 has a DC voltage switch and also an<br>
AC voltage switch 16, which is arranged between the supply<br>
system 11 and the transformer 12. What is furthermore essential<br>
is that that connection terminal of the capacitor 5 which is<br>
connected to the positive pole of the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4 is arranged between the DC voltage connections p of<br>
the phase modules 3a, 3b and 3c and the DC voltage switch 15.<br>
The DC voltage switch 15, the capacitor 5 and the phase modules<br>
3a, 3b and 3c are arranged in a valve hall 17, which is<br>
customary in the construction of a so-called high-voltage<br>
direct-current transmission installation.<br>
In figure 3, the DC voltage switch 15 is in its disconnected<br>
position, in which a current flow via the DC voltage switch 15<br>
is prevented. By contrast, the AC voltage switch 16 is in its<br>
contact position, such that the supply system 11 is<br>
electrically connected to the converter 2 arranged in the valve<br>
hall 17. However, the open DC voltage switch 15 prevents a<br>
current flow via the DC voltage intermediate circuit 4 affected<br>
by a short circuit. The central capacitor 5 can be charged,<br>
however, with the supply system 11 connected in. The current<br>
path for charging the capacitor 5 is illustrated by dashed<br>
lines in figure 3. It can be seen that the charging current<br>
flows via the freewheeling diodes 9 of the submodules 7.<br>
Figure 4 again shows a so-called multilevel converter 14, the<br>
construction of which corresponds to that of the converter in<br>
accordance with figure 2. However, the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to the invention<br><br>
furthermore again comprises a DC voltage switch 15, via which<br>
the DC voltage connections p of the phase modules 3a, 3b and<br>
respectively 3c are connected to the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4. Furthermore, the supply system 11 is again connected<br>
via an AC voltage switch 16 to the transformer and hence to the<br>
converter 2. As in figure 3, the DC voltage switch 15 is in its<br>
disconnected position, the AC voltage switch 16 being in its<br>
contact position. As in figure 3, in the case of a multilevel<br>
converter 14 in accordance with figure 4 as well, in the case<br>
' of this switch position, the charging of the capacitors 13 of<br>
each submodule 7 occurs, the charging current path again being<br>
illustrated by dashed lines. It can be seen that the charging<br>
current flows via that freewheeling diode 9 which has no<br>
thyristor 10 connected in parallel with it.<br>
Figure 5 shows the device in accordance with figure 3, but the<br>
AC voltage switch 16 has been transferred to its disconnected<br>
position. This is effected for example when the capacitor 5 has<br>
been charged with energy to such an extent that triggering of<br>
the thyristor 10 in the case of a fault, that is to say in the<br>
case of a short circuit in the DC voltage intermediate circuit<br>
4, is made possible.<br>
Figure 6 shows the exemplary embodiment in accordance with<br>
figure 2, the AC voltage switch 16 likewise having been<br>
transferred to its disconnected position. Here, too, the AC<br>
voltage switch 16 is transferred to its disconnected position<br>
only when the capacitors 13 of the submodules 7 have been<br>
sufficiently charged in order to be able to trigger the<br>
respective thyristor 10 as semiconductor protective means.<br>
Figure 7 shows the device in accordance with figure 5,	but the<br>
DC voltage switch 15 has been transferred to its	contact<br>
position. On account of the short circuit in the DC	voltage<br>
intermediate<br><br>
circuit 4, the central capacitor 5 connected into the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit 4 in parallel is discharged. In<br>
this case, once again high short-circuit currents flow, which<br>
allow a conclusion to be drawn about a short circuit in the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit 4 on the basis of suitable current<br>
measurement. In other words, the short circuit in the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit 4 is identified on the basis of<br>
the high discharge currents of the capacitor 5, such that<br>
suitable measures can be implemented.<br>
In the case of multilevel topology in accordance with figure 8,<br>
with the same switch position as in figure 7, that is to say<br>
with DC voltage switch 15 closed and AC voltage switch 16 open,<br>
the capacitors 13 are not discharged since the freewheeling<br>
diodes 9 of the submodules 7 prevent them from being<br>
discharged.<br>
Figure 9 shows the exemplary embodiment in accordance with<br>
figure 8, but the AC voltage switch 16 has been transferred to<br>
its contact position. On account of the short circuit in the DC<br>
voltage intermediate circuit 4, a short-circuit current fed<br>
from the supply system 11 flows, said current having been<br>
identified within a few microseconds by a suitable electronic<br>
detection unit or other detection device, which subsequently<br>
triggers the thyristor 10. In this case, the necessary<br>
triggering energy is provided by the previously charged<br>
capacitors 13 of the submodules 7. The short-circuit current,<br>
which is again illustrated by dashed lines in figure 10, thus<br>
passes via the freewheeling diode 9 and simultaneously via the<br>
thyristor 10 connected in parallel. The thyristor 10 has a<br>
sufficiently high surge current-carrying capacity in order to<br>
withstand the high current surge (di/dt). The current-carrying<br>
capacity of the freewheeling diode 9 and the thyristor 10<br>
connected in parallel is also high enough that the expected<br><br>
short-circuit currents do not lead to the destruction of the<br>
power semiconductors.<br><br>
An exemplary embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention is described below. Firstly, the entire device 1 is<br>
disconnected from the supply system 11. Both the AC voltage<br>
switch 16 and the DC voltage switch 15 are transferred to their<br>
disconnected positions. With DC voltage switch 15 still open,<br>
the AC voltage switch 16 is closed. On account of the open DC<br>
voltage switch 15, a possible short circuit in the DC voltage<br>
intermediate circuit 4 does not lead to a short-circuit current<br>
fed from the supply system 11 in the converter 2. On account of<br>
the closed AC voltage switch 16, however, the energy stores in<br>
the converter or in the DC voltage intermediate circuit 4 are<br>
charged by the supply system 11. The semiconductor protective<br>
means, that is to say the thyristors 10, can thus be driven<br>
over a certain time duration. Said time duration is in the<br>
minutes range in practice, since the discharging of the<br>
capacitors is associated with a corresponding time constant.<br>
After the charging of the energy stores 5, 13 by the supply<br>
system 11, the AC voltage switch 16 is opened again and the<br>
converter is thus disconnected from the supply system 11. With<br>
charged energy stores 5, 13 and with AC voltage switch 16 open,<br>
the DC voltage switch 15 is closed. In the case of a short<br>
circuit, with a central intermediate circuit capacitor 5, the<br>
latter is discharged via the DC voltage switch 15, whereby the<br>
fault can be identified. On account of the high discharge<br>
currents, the DC voltage switch 15, if it is advantageously<br>
embodied as a disconnecting switch, is damaged or destroyed. In<br>
the case of a multilevel converter topology with capacitances<br>
distributed between the submodules 7, the charge in the<br>
capacitors is maintained when the DC voltage intermediate<br>
circuit 4 is connected in, since the freewheeling diodes 9 do<br>
not permit any discharging. The DC voltage switch 15 thus<br>
switches without voltage and current,<br><br>
with the result that damage to the DC voltage switch 15 is<br>
avoided. Finally, the AC voltage switch 16 is closed. In the<br>
case of an intermediate voltage circuit 4 affected by a short<br>
circuit, the short-circuit currents driven by the supply system<br>
11 flow through the submodules 7. These are identified rapidly,<br>
that is to say in the range of microseconds, on the basis of a<br>
suitable current measurement, whereupon a triggering signal for<br>
triggering the semiconductor protective means, that is to say<br>
the thyristors 10, is transmitted. By virtue of the precharged<br>
energy stores 5, 13, the driving can initiate a triggering of<br>
the thyristors 10 and thus protect the parallel power<br>
semiconductors 8, 9.<br>
The DC voltage switch 15 is expediently a simple disconnecting<br>
switch. The AC voltage switch 16 is a circuit-breaker, however.<br>
Circuit-breakers can be transferred to their disconnected<br>
position even in the case of currents driven by a voltage, an<br>
arc that arises being extinguished. In other words, circuit-<br>
breakers are able to switch even high powers effectively. By<br>
contrast, disconnecting switches are provided for currentless<br>
opening, with arcing being avoided. Disconnecting switches can<br>
therefore be obtained significantly more cost-effectively.<br><br>
