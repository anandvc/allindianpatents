				<td>Adhesive propylene polymer composition suitable for extrusion coating of paper<br>
substrates<br>
The present invention relates to polypropylene-based adhesive compositions, which are<br>
suitable for extrusion coating especially of paper substrates.<br>
In general, extrusion coating of substrates such as paper, paperboard, fabrics and metal foils<br>
with a thin layer of plastic is practiced on a large scale. The polymer is extruded first whereby<br>
the flux of molten polymeric material passes through a fiat die to obtain a film a few microns<br>
thick, followed by a coating step, whereby the film is laid on a support and passes on a<br>
cooling cylinder. Upon cooling, the polymer adheres to its support.<br>
Low density polyethylene (LDPE) is mainly used in extrusion coating because of the ease in<br>
processing although stiffness, barrier properties and temperature resistance of LDPE are<br>
often not satisfactory.<br>
Polypropylene, also known as propylene polymer, is a well-known commercial polymer,<br>
which is used for a variety of products, such as packaging films and moulded shapes.<br>
Commercial propylene polymers exhibit several desirable properties, such as good heat<br>
tolerance and transparency, which make polypropylene polymers interesting in many<br>
application fields.<br>
However, since many polypropylene materials suffer from low melt strength and low melt<br>
extensibility, they show poor processibility in high speed extrusion coating.<br>
Further, the adhesion of polypropylene on substrates like paper is not satisfactory.<br>
For these reasons only a few polypropylene-based systems are available in the industry for<br>
extrusion coating at present.<br>
Many efforts have been undertaken to improve the processing properties of polypropylene<br>
polymers. The shortcomings during processing have partially been overcome by the class of<br>
high melt strength polypropylene. Such polymers are featured by the introduction of<br>
branchings in the linear polymer backbone. This can be achieved through post-reactor<br>
treatment, copolymerization with dienes, and through polymerization with specific catalysts at<br>
high temperatures.<br>
Although these branched polymer types have improved properties, there is still the desire to<br>
improve their adhesion to substrates such as paper.<br>
To improve the adhesion between the substrate and the plastic layer different methods are<br>
commonly known, such as ozone treatment of the molten polymer film, flame treatment and<br>
corona treatment of the substrate or the use of an adhesive layer.<br>
Various further proposals have been made to increase the adhesion of propylene polymer<br>
layers to different substrates.<br>
For example, US 4 394 485 discloses four component adhesive blends comprising modified<br>
polyolefin resins with improved adhesion to polar substrates such as metal, glass, paper,<br>
etc.. The blend consists of high density polyethylene (HOPE), LDPE, a polypropylene homo-<br>
or copolymer and a polyethylene polymer grafted with carboxylic acid or acid derivate and<br>
can be used in processes like lamination, coextrusion, powder and/or extrusion coating, blow<br>
molding, etc.. The presence of polyethylene components will necessarily limit the thermal<br>
stability of these compositions.<br>
According to US 4 394 485 adhesion tests have been done by heat sealing of compression<br>
molded films into substrates, which is not comparable to the extrusion coating process due<br>
the residence time, temperature and thickness of the coating. Nevertheless, an improved<br>
adhesion to rather unporous substrates like polypropylene (PP) and ethylene-vinyl alcohol<br>
(EVOH) films, and aluminium foil was observed.<br>
WO 00/69982 describes adhesive propylene polymer compositions suitable for coating<br>
substrates, which show improved adhesion to metals without the need for a primer coating or<br>
to polymeric substrates, with a primer coating without the need for post heating.<br>
This blend consists of three components comprising (a) 50 to 80 wt% of an unmodified<br>
propylene polymer, which may be a homo- or a copolymer, a heterophasic propylene<br>
polymer or mixtures thereof, (b) 10 to 30 wt% of a high melt strength propylene polymer and<br>
(c) 3 to 30 wt% of a modified propylene polymer grafted with an unsaturated compound<br>
having a polar group, wherein the total of (a), (b) and (c) is 100%.<br>
US 4 957 968 describes a three component adhesive thermoplastic elastomer blend, which<br>
is adherent to metal, glass, wood, polyolefins and polar polymers with no pretreatment or use<br>
of other adhesives.<br>
The three components are (a) a polyolefin modified by a chemically reactive functional group,<br>
(b) a polymer prepared from one or more of the following: ethylene, propylene, butylene,<br>
isobutylene, octene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, hexene-1 and (c) an olefinic elastomer. For<br>
example such a blend comprises (a) maleic anhydride modified polypropylene, (b)<br>
polypropylene and (c) ethylene propylene diene rubber.<br>
WO 00/31181 describes wettable polypropylene compositions comprising up to 85 wt% of<br>
unmodified polypropylene and up to 35 wt% of a hydrophilic, polar compound which includes<br>
functional sites selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether or ester<br>
moieties. For example maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP) can be used as<br>
polar compound. To provide permanent wettablity a mixture from unmodified polypropylene<br>
with e.g. MAPP is treated with hot potassium hydroxide. The composition can be used for<br>
example to achieve a wettable polypropylene extrusion coating on paper or paperboard for<br>
use in packaging applications where stiffness and printability is important.<br>
Although much development work has been done in the field of adhesive propylene polymer<br>
compositions, there is a continuous need for alternative or improved adhesive propylene<br>
polymer compositions, which can be used in extrusion coating for paper substrates and<br>
which show an improved adhesion to the substrate compared to known propylene polymer<br>
materials, high melt strength propylene polymers and blends thereof.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to provide polypropylene compositions, which are<br>
particularly suitable for extrusion coating on paper substrates, having high melt strength and<br>
improved adhesion to paper or paperboard without the need of surface treating methods or<br>
additional adhesion layers.<br>
A further object of the invention is the use of the polypropylene composition in extrusion<br>
coating processes using paper or paperboard as substrate.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate or article which has at least<br>
one layer of highly adherent propylene polymer composition on at least one surface.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Tine present invention relates to polypropylene compositions useable for extrusion coating of<br>
paper substrates and showing improved adhesion to the substrate, yielding extrusion coating<br>
products of high quality.<br>
Particularly, the present invention deals with two component adhesion compositions suitable<br>
for extension coating paper substrates comprising a blend of high melt strength<br>
polypropylene and one component selected from the group of<br>
(i) maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP)<br>
(ii) maieic anhydride-modified polypropylene wax<br>
(iii) polypropylene homopolymer with high melt flow rate or<br>
(iv) ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot melt adhesive<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has now been discovered that the problems and deficiencies relating to the compositions<br>
and blends according to the state of the art regarding insufficient adhesion to paper or<br>
paperboard substrates can be avoided or at least significantly decreased with a composition<br>
according to the present invention. It has been noted that certain combinations of high melt<br>
strength polypropylene with special polypropylenes or an ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot<br>
melt adhesive meet the objectives.<br>
The two component adhesion composition suitable for extrusion coating paper substrates<br>
according to the invention comprises:<br>
a) from 70 to 98 wt%, preferably 75 to 95 wt% of high melt strength polypropylene (A) with a<br>
branching index g' of 0.9 or less and<br>
b) from 2 to 30 wt%, preferably 5 to 25 wt% of a component (B) selected from the group of<br>
(i) maieic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP)<br>
(ii) maieic anhydride-modified polypropylene wax<br>
(iii) polypropylene homopolymer with high melt flow rate or<br>
(iv) ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot melt adhesive<br>
Thus the first mandatory component in the present invention is a polypropylene (A)<br>
characterized by a certain degree of branching. Possible polypropylenes (A) are so called<br>
Y/H-polypropylenes and are for instance described in EP 0 787 750, i.e. single branched<br>
polypropylene types (Y polypropylenes having a backbone with a single long side-chain and<br>
an architecture resembles a "Y") and polypropylene types in which polymer chains are<br>
coupled with a bridging group (an architecture resembles a "H"), as well as multi-branched<br>
polypropylenes, i.e. not only the polypropylene backbone is furnished with a larger number of<br>
side chains (branched polypropylene) but also some of the side chains themselves. Such<br>
polypropylenes are characterized by rather high melt strength.<br>
A parameter of the degree of branching is the branching index g'. The branching index g'<br>
correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The branching index g' is defined as<br>
g'=[IV]br/[IV]lin in which g' is the branching index, [IVbr] is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched<br>
polypropylene and [IV]lin is the intrinsic viscosity of the linear polypropylene having the same<br>
weight average molecular weight (within a range of ±10 %) as the branched polypropylene.<br>
Thereby, a low g'-value is an indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the<br>
g'-value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene increases. Reference is made in this<br>
context to B.H. Zimm and W.H. Stockmeyer. J. Chem. Rhys. 17,1301 (1949). This document<br>
is herewith included by reference.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity needed for determining the branching index g' is measured according<br>
to DIN ISO 1628/1, October 1999 (in Decalin at 135 °C).<br>
Thus it is preferred that the branching index g' of the polypropylene (A) shall be less than 0.9,<br>
more preferably equal or less than 0.8. In another preferred embodiment the branching<br>
index g' of the polypropylene (A) shall be preferably less than 0.7.<br>
The polypropylene (A) can be a propylene homopolymer or a propylene copolymer, wherein<br>
the homopolymer is preferred.<br>
Accordingly, the homopolymer as well as the copolymer can be a unimodal or multimodal<br>
polymer composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polypropylene is preferably unimodal. In another preferred<br>
embodiment the polypropylene is preferably multimodal, more preferably bimodal.<br>
"Multimodal" or "multimodal distribution" describes a frequency distribution that has several<br>
relative maxima. In particular, the expression "modality of a polymer" refers to the form of its<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD) curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer<br>
weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight. If the polymer is produced in the<br>
sequential step process, i.e. by utilizing reactors coupled in series, and using different<br>
conditions in each reactor, the different polymer fractions produced in the different reactors<br>
each have their own molecular weight distribution which may considerably differ from one<br>
another. The molecular weight distribution curve of the resulting final polymer can be seen at<br>
a super-imposing of the molecular weight distribution curves of the polymer fraction which<br>
will, accordingly, show a more distinct maxima, or at least be distinctively broadened<br>
compared with the curves for individual fractions.<br>
A polymer showing such molecular weight distribution curve is called bimodal or multimodal,<br>
respectively.<br>
The expression homopolymer used in the instant invention relates to a polypropylene that<br>
consists substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt%, preferably of at least 99 wt%, and most<br>
preferably of at least 99.8 wt% of propylene units. In a preferred embodiment only propylene<br>
units in the propylene homopolymer are detectable. The comonomer content can be<br>
determined with FT infrared spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
In case the polypropylene according to this invention is a propylene copolymer, it is preferred<br>
that the comonomer is ethylene. However, also other comonomers known in the art are<br>
suitable. Preferably, the total amount of comonomer, more preferably ethylene, in the<br>
propylene copolymer is up to 15 wt%, more preferably up to 10 wt%.<br>
It is also possible that the polypropylene is a propylene copolymer comprising a<br>
polypropylene matrix and an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR).<br>
The polypropylene matrix can be a homopolymer or a copolymer, more preferably<br>
multimodal, i.e. bimodal, homopolymer or a multimodal, i.e. bimodal, copolymer. In case the<br>
polypropylene matrix is a propylene copolymer, then it is preferred that the comonomer is<br>
ethylene or butene. However, also other comonomers known in the art are suitable. The<br>
preferred amount of comonomer, more preferably ethylene, in the polypropylene matrix is up<br>
to 8.00 mol%. In case the propylene copolymer matrix has ethylene as the comonomer<br>
component, it is in particular preferred that the amount of ethylene in the matrix is up to<br>
8.00 mol%, more preferably less than 6.00 mol%. In case the propylene copolymer matrix<br>
has butene as the comonomer component, it is in particular preferred that the amount of<br>
butene in the matrix is up to 6.00 mol%, more preferably less than 4.00 mol%.<br>
Preferably, the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) in the total propylene copolymer is up to<br>
60wt%. More preferably the amount of ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) in the total<br>
propylene copolymer is in the range of 15 to 60 wt%, still more preferably in the range of 20<br>
to 50 wt%.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the polypropylene being a copolymer comprising a<br>
polypropylene matrix and an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) has an ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber (EPR) with an ethylene-content of up to 65 wt%.<br>
The high degree of branching of the polypropylene (A) contributes also to its melt strength.<br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the polypropylene (A) is further characterized by a melt<br>
strength of at least 10 cN at a maximum speed of at least 200 mm/s, more preferably by a<br>
melt strength of at least 20 cN at a maximum speed of at least 200 mm/s, still more<br>
preferably by a melt strength of at least 25 cN at a maximum speed of at least 200 mm/s, yet<br>
more preferably by a melt strength of at least 25 cN at a maximum speed of at least<br>
250 mm/s. The measuring of the melt strength has been undertaken by a temperature of<br>
200 °C with an acceleration of the melt strand drawn down of 120 mm/sec2. The exact<br>
measuring method is defined in the example section.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the polypropylene has a melt flow rate (MFR) given in a<br>
specific range. The melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is<br>
due to the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short<br>
molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the MFR-value. The melt<br>
flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged through a defined die<br>
under specified temperature and pressure conditions and the measure of viscosity of the<br>
polymer which, in turn, for each type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight<br>
but also by its degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at<br>
230 °C (150 1133) is denoted as MFR2 (230 °C). Accordingly, it is preferred that in the<br>
present invention the polypropylene (A) has an MFR2 (230 °C) in a range of 0.01 to 100 g/10<br>
min, more preferably of 0.10 to 50 g/10 min, still more preferred of 1.00 to 25 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably the cross-linked fraction of the polypropylene (A) does not exceed 1.0 wt.-%, even<br>
more preferred does not exceed 0.8wt.-%, still more preferred does not exceed 0.5wt.-%<br>
determined as the relative amount of polymer insoluble in boiling xylene (xylene hot insoluble<br>
fraction, XHI).<br>
More preferably, the polypropylene of the instant invention is isotactic. Thus the<br>
polypropylene according to this invention shall have a rather high pentade concentration, i.e.<br>
higher than 90 %, more preferably higher than 92 % and most preferably higher than 93 %.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the pentade concentration is higher than 95 %. The<br>
pentade concentration is an indicator for the narrowness in the stereoregularity distribution of<br>
the polypropylene.<br>
The high melt strength polypropylene (A) can be preferably further defined by the way<br>
obtained.<br>
Accordingly the polypropylene (A) can be the result of treating an unmodified polypropylene<br>
(A') with thermally decomposing radical-fonning agents and/or with ionizing radiation, where<br>
both treatments may optionally be accompanied or followed by a treatment with bi- or<br>
multifunctionally unsaturated monomers, e.g. butadiene, isoprene, dimethylbutadiene or<br>
divinylbenzene. A suitable method to obtain the polypropylene (A) is for instance disclosed in<br>
EP 0 879 830 A1 and EP 0 890 612 A2. Both documents are herewith included by reference.<br>
The unmodified polypropylene (A') has preferably a MFR2 (230 °C) in a range of 0.05 to<br>
45.00 g/10 min. More preferably the MFR2 (230 °C) is in a range of 0.05 to 35.00 g/10 min in<br>
case the unmodified polypropylene (A') is a homopolymer. On the other hand the<br>
MFR2 (230 °C) is in a range of 0.05 to 45.00 g/10 min in case the unmodified polypropylene<br>
(A') is a copolymer.<br>
Preferably the unmodified polypropylene (A') comprises 85.0 to 99,9 wt.-% of propylene and<br>
0.1 to 15.0 wt% of one or more a-olefins with 2 or 4 to 18 carbon atoms, in particular<br>
ethylene.<br>
As stated above the unmodified polypropylene (A') is preferably multimodal, more preferably<br>
bimodal. Accordingly it is preferred that the unmodified polypropylene (A') has a molecular<br>
weight distribution (MWD) of 5 to 60, more preferably in the range of 15 to 35.<br>
Moreover the unmodified polypropylene (A') has preferably a weight average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) of 500,000 to 1,500,000 g/mol, more preferably in the range of 600,000 to<br>
1,000,000 g/mole. The number average molecular weight (Mn) preferably ranges of 25,000 to<br>
100,000 g/mol and more preferably of 30,000 to 100,000 g/mol.<br>
The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw)<br>
as well as the molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined in the instant invention by<br>
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument with<br>
online viscometer. The oven temperature is 140 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent<br>
(ISO 16014).<br>
The peroxide used for the manufacture of polypropylene (A) is preferably a thermally<br>
decomposing free radical-forming agent, more preferably selected from the group consisting<br>
of acyl peroxide, alkyl peroxide, hydroperoxide, perester and peroxycarbonate.<br>
The following listed peroxides are in particular preferred:<br>
Acyl peroxides: benzoyl peroxide, 4-chlorobenzoyl peroxide, 3-methoxybenzoyl peroxide<br>
and/or methyl benzoyl peroxide.<br>

or mixtures of these above listed free radical-forming agents.<br>
If present in the process for the manufacture of the polypropylene (A), the (volatile)<br>
bifunctional monomers are preferably ethylenically unsaturated, multifunctional monomers,<br>
like C4 to C10 dienes and/or C7 to C10 divinyl compounds. Especially preferred bifunctional<br>
monomers are butadiene, isoprene, dimethylbutadiene and divinylbenzene.<br>
The polypropylene (A) is preferably obtained by a process as described in EP 0 879 830 A1<br>
and EP 0 890 612 A2. Both documents are herewith included by reference. Accordingly the<br>
polypropylene is produced by<br>
(a) mixing<br>
(i) a unmodified propylene homopolymer and/or copolymer (A') as<br>
defined above, preferably a unmodified propylene homopolymer with a<br>

Preferred as cocatalysts for metallocenes and non-metallocenes, if desired, are the<br>

methylaluminoxane (MAO). Such aluminoxanes can be used as the sole cocatalyst or<br>
together with other cocatalyst(s). Thus besides or in addition to aluminoxanes, other cation<br>
complex forming catalysts activators can be used. Said activators are commercially available<br>
or can be prepared according to the prior art literature.<br>

example, with the boron activators, 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 2:1 to 1:2, such as 1:1, ratio of the<br>

known in the art and numerous commercially available graft modified maleic anhydride<br>
polymers are available.<br>
The graft-modified polypropylene (i) used in the present invention is a polypropylene<br>
modified by partially or wholly grafting with maleic anhydride.<br>

copolymer of propylene and an alpha-olefin containing constituent units derived from the<br>
alpha-olefin other than propylene in amounts of not more than 10% by mole based on<br>

reaction by adding the graft monomer maleic anhydride to a molten polymer or a method<br>
of performing graft reaction by dissolving a polymer in a solvent to make a solution to<br>
which the graft monomer is added may be employed.<br>

above processes, the graft monomer maleic anhydride can be efficiently graft<br>
polymerized, in this case, the radical initiator is used in an amount of usually 0.001 to 1<br>
part per weight based on 100 parts per weight of the polypropylene. The radical initiators<br>
used herein are, for example, an organic peroxide or an azo compound.<br>
Specific examples of the radical initiators include benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide,<br>
dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-<br>

graft polymerization using no radical initiator is set in the range of usually 60 to 350°C,<br>
preferably 150°C to 300°C.<br>
The content of the maleic anhydride can be easily controlled, for example, by suitable<br>
selection of the grafting conditions.<br>

invention is in the range of 0.001 to 10 wt%, preferably 0.01 to 5 wt%, more preferably<br>

from 1 to 60 mg KOH/g, more preferably from 2 to 40 mg KOH/g.<br>
The acid number is defined as the number of milligrams of KOH which are required to<br>
neutralize one gram of sample. Acid numbers were obtained by titrating weighed samples<br>
dissolved in refluxing -xylene with methanolic potassium hydroxide using phenolphthalein<br>
as an indicator. End points were taken when the pink color of the indicator remained 10<br>
seconds.<br>
The synthesis of the unmodified, i.e. nonpolar, starting waxes by means of catalysts of the<br>
Ziegler or metallocene type is known from numerous documents. Thus, for example, DE-<br>
A-2329641 discloses a process by means of which a-olefins can be polymerized in a<br>
direct polymerization reaction using Ziegler catalysts to give homopolymer or copolymer<br>
waxes. DE-A-3148229 describes the preparation of highly crystalline polypropylene waxes<br>
by polymerization likewise using titanium-containing catalysts; the same in EP-A480190.<br>
In addition, propylene homopolymer and copolymer waxes are also obtainable using<br>
metallocene catalysts (e.g. US 6,331,590, EP-A-321 852, EP-A-384 264, EP-A416 566 or<br>
EP 571 882).<br>
Suitable starting materials are low molecular weight propylene homopolymers prepared<br>
using Ziegler or metallocene catalysts and having melt viscosities, measured at a<br>
temperature 10°C above Ts, of from 20 to 50 000 mPa s. The softening points (ring/ball) of<br>
such waxes are generally from 90 to 165° C. Suitable waxes are both highly crystalline<br>
products having a high proportion of isotactic or syndiotactic structures and those having a<br>
low crystallinity and a predominantly atactic structure. The degree of crystallinity of<br>
propylene homopolymers can be varied within wide limits in a known manner by<br>
appropriate selection of the catalyst used for the polymerization and by means of the<br>
polymerization conditions. This applies particularly when using metallocene catalyst<br>
systems.<br>
Further suitable starting materials are propylene copolymer waxes which are prepared<br>
using Ziegler or metallocene catalysts and comprise not only propylene but also varying<br>
amounts of other olefins, for example ethylene or higher a-olefins having a chain length<br>
range of C4 -C30, where the comonomer units can be distributed either predominantly<br>
randomly or predominantly in blocks between isotactic, syndiotactic or partially atactic<br>
polypropylene sequences. Such waxes have softening points (ring/ball) of generally from<br>
about 90 to 165° C.<br>
Preferably unmodified polypropylene waxes prepared in the presence of a metallocene<br>
catalyst are used for being grafted with maleic acid.<br>
The grafting process can be performed as described for component (i), according to well-<br>
known processes. For example, grafting with maleic anhydride may be performed for<br>
example according to US 5,998,547, US 6,569,950 or EP 0 941 257.<br>
The reaction of the polypropylene wax with maleic anhydride can be carried out either<br>
continuously or batchwise. In the batchwise procedure, the wax is heated to a<br>
temperature above its softening point and maleic anhydride and a peroxide, as described<br>
above, are introduced into the melt while stirring, either continuously over an appropriate<br>
period of time or in one or more portions, if desired under a blanket of inert gas. The<br>
reaction temperature is above the softening point of the wax, preferably from 100 to 200°<br>
C, particularly preferably from 130 to 180° C. After metering-in is complete, the mixture<br>
can be left to react further at the same temperature or a different temperature, if desired<br>
after addition of a further amount of peroxide. Volatile components fomned during the<br>
reaction or excess volatile starting components can, for example, be distilled off under<br>
reduced pressure or be removed by stripping with inert gas.<br>
Examples of commercially available modified polypropylene products that can suitably be<br>
employed in the present invention are Licocene® PP MA 7452, Licocene® PP MA 6252<br>
TP, Licocene® PP MA 6452, Licocene® PP MA 1332 TP, Licocene® PP MA 1452 all by<br>
Clariant, Epolene E-43 by Eastman, and the like.<br>
(iii) polypropylene homopolymer with high melt flow rate<br>
According to the present invention polypropylene homopolymers with high melt flow rate<br>
can also be used as component B.<br>
The polymers that can be suitably be employed have a melt flow rate (MFR) measured<br>
according to ISO 1133 at 230°C under a load of 2.16 kg of from 50 to 3000 g/10 min,<br>
preferably from 100 to 2000 g/10 min, more preferably from 200 to 1500 g/10 min.<br>
The expression homopolymer used in the instant invention relates to a polypropylene that<br>
consists substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt%, preferably of at least 99 wt%, and most<br>
preferably of at least 99.8 wt% of propylene units. In a preferred embodiment only<br>
propylene units in the propylene homopolymer are detectable. The comonomer content<br>
can be determined with FT infrared spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
The high melt flow rate polypropylenes used according to the invention can be produced<br>
directly in a polymerization reactor by well known processes, described in several patent<br>
applications (for example in EP 0 320 150, EP 0 480 190. EP 0 622 380, EP 1 303 547,<br>
EP 1 538 167, EP 1 783 145, WO 2007/140019, etc.).<br>
Alternatively the high melt flow rate polypropylenes used according to the invention can be<br>
obtained by controlled rheology (CR) techniques, including, e.g., visbreaking, which<br>
means that a polymer, having low melt flow rate, is subjected to a post-reactor treatment,<br>
wherein the polymer molecules are subjected to controlled scission in molten state. The<br>
scission may be carried out by mechanical shearing, radiation and oxidation or chemically<br>
with peroxy compounds.<br>
Preferably controlled rheology treatments are carried out using organic peroxides.<br>
The process of visbreaking a propylene polymer material is well known to those skilled in<br>
the art and is described in several patent applications (for example in US 3 940 379, US 4<br>
951 589, US 4 282 076, US 5 250 631, EP 0 462 574, WO 02/096986, WO 2004/113438<br>
The polymer used as starting compound for the controlled rheology treatment may be<br>
produced by any polymerisation process known in the art.<br>
The polymerisation process may be a continuous process or a batch process utilising<br>
known methods and operating in liquid phase, optionally in the presence of an inert<br>
diluent, or in gas phase or by mixed liquid-gas techniques. The process is preferably<br>
carried out in the presence of a stereospecific catalyst system.<br>
As catalyst any ordinary stereospecific Ziegler-Natta catalysts or any metallocene catalyst<br>
capable of catalysing the formation of a propylene polymer can be used.<br>
In addition, examples of commercially available modified polypropylene products that can<br>
suitably be employed in the present invention are Borflow™ HL504FB, HL508FB or<br>
HL512FB all by Borealis, Metocene MF650 by Basell Polyolefins, Marlex® HGZ-1200 by<br>
Phillips Sumika Polypropylene Company, Escorene™ PP3505 and PP3746 all by<br>
ExxonMobile. EOD 96-36 and 3960X by Fina, Valtec grades like HH442H, HH441,<br>
PF008, PF017, etc. by LyondellBasell etc..<br>
(iv) ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot melt adhesive<br>
A hot melt adhesive is generally manufactured from a mixture of three components: a<br>
thermoplastic resin, a tackifying agent, and paraffin or a microcrystalline polymeric wax.<br>
The thermoplastic resins commonly used in compositions for the manufacture of hot melt<br>
adhesives have included copolymers of ethylene and vinyl esters, particularly vinyl<br>
acetate, or copolymers of ethylene and alkyl acrylates, particularly ethyl acrylate and butyl<br>
acrylate.<br>
According to the present invention hot melt adhesives based on ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymers can be used as component B<br>
Various formulations including ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers are known in the<br>
art.<br>
Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers are conventionally regarded as those<br>
copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate where the weight percentage of ethylene in the<br>
polymer molecule exceeds that of the vinyl acetate.<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA) useful herein are those containing at least<br>
about 15 to 45 wt% vinyl acetate and having a melt index (ISO 1133, 190°C, 2.16 kg) in<br>
the range of 2 to 2500 g/10 min. The EVA copolymers will preferably comprise less than<br>
40 weight percent vinyl acetate (VA), although EVA copolymers are nowadays available<br>
with a vinyl acetate content of above 50 wt%<br>
Useful commercially available ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are for example<br>
ATEVA® grades from AT Plastics Inc., Brampton, Ontario, Escruene® grades from<br>
ExxonMobile, Elvax® grades from Dupont, Evatane® grades, for example supplied by<br>
Atofina, and the like.<br>
Useful commercially available hot melt adhesives based on ethyiene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymers that can suitably be employed in the present invention are for example<br>
Sitomelt® grades like K 608/1 from Kiiito OY, Quicklock Hotmelt CH 155 supplied by<br>
Chemline India Ltd., 3M™ Jet-melt™ hot melt adhesive grades, etc..<br>
The two component adhesion compositions according to the present invention comprise a)<br>
70 to 98 wt% of component (A), described in detail above and b) 2 to 30 wt% of component<br>
(B), described in detail above.<br>
Preferably the two component adhesion compositions according to the present invention<br>
comprise a) 75 to 95 wt% of component (A) and b) 5 to 25 wt% of component (B).<br>
As component (B) preferably one compound selected from the group of<br>
(i) maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP)<br>
(ii) maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene wax or<br>
(iv) ethylene-vinylacetat based hot melt adhesive<br>
all described in detail above, is used.<br>
More preferably component (B) is (i) a maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP) or<br>
(ii) a maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene wax and still more preferably component (B)<br>
is a maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene wax.<br>
The adhesive composition in accordance with the present invention may furthermore<br>
comprise small amounts of additional, conventional components (additives), commonly used<br>
and well known in the adhesive art. The type and amount of such additives can be selected<br>
by the skilled person on the basis of the general knowledge in the art. Typically these<br>
additive do not amount to more than 5 wt.-% (in total), based on the adhesive composition.<br>
The adhesive composition may be prepared in a usual manner, including blending the<br>
individual components using appropriate devices, such as kneaders and extruders.<br>
Thus the highly adhesive composition of the present invention may be prepared by mixing<br>
the two components and optionally one ore more additives, as described above, to form a<br>
blend and then melt kneading the resulting mixture.<br>
The melt-kneading may be carried out using a kneading machine, such as a mixing roll, a<br>
Branbury mixer, a kneader, or a single-screw or twin-screw extruder.<br>
The adhesive composition according to the present invention has particular utility as a<br>
coating for paper substrates.<br>
Any types of papers conventionally known in the art for preparing coated papers can be<br>
used, such as but not limited to kraft paper, natural or synthetic pulp paper, paper board,<br>
liner board and the like. The paper may further be bleached and/or coated.<br>
The adhesive composition in accordance with the present invention is in particular suitable<br>
for coating by extrusion processes.<br>
The extrusion coating process may be carried out using conventional extrusion coating<br>
techniques.<br>
Hence, the adhesive composition according to the present invention is fed, typically in the<br>
form of pellets, optionally containing additives, to an extruding device. From the extruder the<br>
polymer melt is passed preferably through a flat die to the substrate to be coated. Due to the<br>
distance between the die lip and the nip, the molten plastic is oxidized in the air for a short<br>
period, usually leading to an improved adhesion between the coating and the substrate. The<br>
coated substrate is cooled on a chill roll, after which it is passed to edge trimmers and wound<br>
up. The width of the line may vary between, for example, 500 to 1500 mm, e. g. 800 to 1100<br>
mm, with a line speed of up to 1000 m/min, for instance 300 to 800 m/min. The temperature<br>
of the polymer melt is typically between 275 and 330 °C. The polypropylene of the invention<br>
can be extruded onto the substrate as a monolayer coating or as one layer in coextrusion. In<br>
a multilayer extrusion coating, the other layers may comprise any polymer resin having the<br>
desired properties and processability.<br>
Therefore, a further object of the invention is the use of the polypropylene composition in<br>
extrusion coating processes using paper, as defined above, as substrate.<br>
The composition of the present invention is highly adhesive and thus none of the methods<br>
commonly known in the art to improve adhesion between the paper substrate and the<br>
polypropylene layer produced from the composition according to the invention, such as<br>
ozone treatment of the molten polymer film, corona treatment of the substrate and use of a<br>
coextruded adhesion layer need to be applied.<br>
Nevertheless it is possible to perform ozone and/or corona treatment in a know way, if<br>
desired or necessary.<br>
The main end-uses for extrusion coated products obtained by using the adhesive<br>
composition according to the invention are in packaging applications, like liquid packaging for<br>
milk, juice, wine or other liquids, flexible packaging for meat, cheese and medical products,<br>
rigid packaging like detergent cartons, cup and plate boards for oven or microwave use or<br>
sterilizable food packaging, but also for photographic paper or industrial applications like<br>
paper reel and ream wraps.<br>
The present invention, as outlined above, therefore also provides a substrate, respectively<br>
article which has at least one layer of highly adherent propylene polymer composition<br>
according to the invention on at least one surface.<br>
Furthermore the present invention is also directed to the use of the inventive article as<br>
packaging material, in particular as a packaging material for food and/or medical products.<br>
In the following, the present invention is described by way of examples.<br>
Definitions/Measuring Methods<br>
The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the above general<br>
description of the invention as well as to the below examples unless othenwise defined.<br>
Number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined by size exclusion chromatography<br>
(SEC) using Waters Alliance GPCV2000 instrument with online viscometer. The oven<br>
temperature is 140 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent (ISO 16014).<br>
In detail: The number average molecular weight (Mn), the weight average molecular weight<br>
(Mw) and the molecular weight distribution (MWD) are measured by a method based on ISO<br>
16014-1:2003 and ISO 16014-4:2003. A Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instnjment, equipped<br>
with refractive index detector and online viscosimeter was used with 3 x TSK-gel columns<br>
(GMHXL-HT) from TosoHaas and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 200 mg/L 2,6-<br>
Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol) as solvent at 145 °C and at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min.<br>
216.5 |jL of sample solution were injected per analysis. The column set was calibrated using<br>
relative calibration with 19 narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 0.5<br>
kg/mol to 11 500 kg/mol and a set of well characterized broad polypropylene standards. All<br>
samples were prepared by dissolving 5 -10 mg of polymer in 10 mL (at 160 °C) of stabilized<br>
TCB (same as mobile phase) and keeping for 3 hours with continuous shaking prior sampling<br>
in into the GPC instrument.<br>
Melt strength and melt extensibility by Rheotens measurement:<br>
The strain hardening behaviour of polymers is analysed by Rheotens apparatus (product of<br>
Gottfert, Siemensstr. 2, 74711 Buchen, Germany) in which a melt strand is elongated by<br>
drawing down with a defined acceleration. The haul-off force F in dependence of draw-down<br>
velocity v is recorded.<br>
The test procedure is performed in a standard climatised room with controlled room<br>
temperature of T = 23 °C. The Rheotens apparatus is combined with an extruder/melt pump<br>
for continuous feeding of the melt strand. The extrusion temperature is 200 °C; a capillary die<br>
with a diameter of 2 mm and a length of 6 mm is used and the acceleration of the melt strand<br>
drawn down is 120 mm/s2. The maximum points (Fmax; Vmax) at failure of the strand are<br>
characteristic for the strength and the drawability of the melt.<br>
Intrinsic viscosity: is measured according to DIN ISO 1628/1, October 1999 (in Decalin at<br>
135 °C).<br>
The crosslinked fraction is assumed to be identical to the xylene hot insoluble (XHI)<br>
fraction, which is determined by extracting 1 g of finely cut polymer sample with 500 ml<br>
xylene in a Soxleth extractor for 48 hours at the boiling temperature. The remaining solid<br>
amount is dried at 90°C and weighed for determining the insolubles amount.<br>
Adhesion<br>
Peel resistance (adhesive bond strength) was determined with the T-Peel Test according to<br>
ASTM D 1876 - 01 using an Instron 4502 tensile tester.<br>
Test samples: extrusion coated UG kraft paper; 5 pieces, cut in machine direction, 25.4 x<br>
150 mm. Samples were conditioned for one day at a relative humidity of 50 ± 2 % at 23 ±<br>
1 °C.<br>
The layers were separated at the desired interface, placed to the arms of the tensile tester<br>
and the force required to pull the layers apart was measured. The result was the force<br>
needed for peeling given in N/cm (peel strength in terms of load per unit width of bond line)<br>
The peeling types are defined as "fiber-tear" (if the propylene composition film being<br>
extrusion coated onto the paper substrate is separated from that paper takes fibers with it,<br>
meaning extremely good adhesion; e.g. cohesive failure in paper) or "no fibers" (no fibers are<br>
taken; pure peeling)<br>
