				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This process relates to a process for the preparation of fermented and dehydrated batter useful for making Indian traditional products such as idli, dosa.<br>
Idli and dosa are traditional fermented products in India generally prepared from milled rice and black gram dhal which is consumed mainly at the breakfast time. Generally idli is prepared from parboiled rice and black gram dhal whereas dosa is from raw rice, parboiled rice and black gram dhal in a particular proportion.<br>
Idli is generally prepared by soaking parboiled rice as well as black gram dhal separately. Soaked rice is ground to the coarser particle size, while soaked black gram dhal is ground to a fine paste. Afterwards both are mixed thoroughly and fermented for about 18 hours as reported by Desikachar et. ai (1960). Afterwards the fermented batter is steamed for 15 minutes at atmospheric pressure for preparation of idli.<br>
Later Sowbhagya et. al (1991) reported that generally high amylose rice varieties (&gt; 22% amylose content or amylose equivalent) are best suited for preparation of idli. Susheelamma and Rao (1976) carried out studies on idli texture and concluded that the mucilageous principles present in the black gram dhal is responsible for the texture of idli. Best results in terms of idli spongy texture was obtained when rice and black gram dhal were taken in proportion of 2 :1 as observed by Desikachar et al (1960).<br>
Dosa is another fermented pancake type product prepared from a mixture of milled rice and black gram dhal. Generally raw rice, parboiled rice and black gram dhal is taken in 3 : 1 : 1 proportion and soaked together for 4 to 5 hours and ground to fine batter and left for fermentation overnight. Next day salt is mixed to fermented batter to the desired taste and the batter is poured on a<br>
heated pan and spread. The finished product texture is measured in terms of eye formation (small apertures on dosa).<br>
To overcome the drudgery in preparation of these products the Institute had come out earlier with ready mixes which needed just a step of reconstitution of the mix to batter and prepare the products in the traditional manner (CFTRI Annual Report, 1965). These ready mixes are generally prepared from a blend of cereal (rice) and black gram flours to which chemical leavening agents are added to obtain the texture of the finished product. These products generally lack the fermented flavour though texture of the traditional product is simulated through the addition of leavening agents since fermentation is not carried out during the above process. Requirement of the chemical leavening is fairly high which works out to be about 5% for ready mix of dosa/idli.<br>
Attempt has been made to use the dried fermented batter as a source of organisms to a blend of rice and black gram flour and allowed to ferment before the product is made. Here the product needs fermentation and does not offer convenience to the consumers. Recently (past about 15 years) a mechanical grinder has been developed for grinding of soaked rice black gram in wet condition to obtain the fermentable batter. Such units are commercially marked and used by large scale producers of idli and dosa. Though this offers a method for grinding soaked ingredients, the batter still needs to be fermented and hence does not offer convenience and facilitate instant preparation of the product. In another variation an attempt has been made to market the fermented ready to use batter in the retailed pouches with a shelf stability at ambient temperature (days at 28 - 32°C). This was achieved through the use of a consortium consisting of Lactobacillus brevis CFR 2134, Pediococus pentosaceus CFR 2123<br>
and Candida versatilis CFR 505. A patent has been filed for the same and limitation of this process is the requirement of desired consortium of cultures, which needs to be specially maintained and also shelf life of only 6 days for the batter and hence not suitable for wide commercial use (R &amp; D at CFTRI, 1950 -2000, p- 260). The present innovation, on the other hand, has achieved a dehydration process by which the product is offered as a "fermented dry mix." Even the requirement of additives like chemical leavening agents in the process has been used only in the case of idli mix at considerably reduced level while it is totally avoided in the case of dosa mix. The mixes so prepared could just be reconstituted at home and prepare the final product by steaming the batter (idli) or baking on the hot pan for dosa which is normally the traditional practice. Thus this process offers both convenience and advantages of the traditional fermentation.<br>
Idli and dosa are two very important and popular fermented dishes of South India. Ready mix formulations standardized earlier for these fermented products was based on addition of leavening agents for imparting proper texture of the product. Though the mixes so prepared yielded products of acceptable texture, they do not give the advantages of the traditional fermentation. In view of this it is desirable to develop such ready mixes based on the fermented batters which could be easily reconstituted to obtain the finished products at home. The product making quality of the dehydrated flour so obtained could be further improved by the addition of modified starches to prepare product like Uthappam . The main object of the present invention is to develop a process for the preparation  of fermented  and  dehydrated  batter  useful  for making   Indian<br>
traditional products idli, dosa and the like which obviates the drawbacks outlined above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to standardize a method to prepare rice soji of desired particle size to obtain proper texture (porous and fluffy) in the prepared idli.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to retain the fermented aroma in the dehydrated batter so as to resemble traditionally prepared product.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare a fermented and dehydrated batter for the preparation of dosa with the texture (with respect to eye formation) and proper sensory profile of the finished product (dosa).<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop a process which gives a fermented and dehydrated batters that could be used fro the preparation of idli as well as dosa in a short time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fermented and dehydrated batter useful for making Indian traditional products such as idli, dosa comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	grinding he parboiled rice by mechanical means to obtain a semolina of particle size ranging between 18 and 60 mesh (BSS-British sieve standards),to get rice soji<br>
b)	soaking the Black gram Dhal in water in a ratio of 1:3 to 1:4 (w/v) for a period ranging from 3 to 4 hours,<br>
c)	grinding the said soaked Dhal in a wet grinder with intermittently adding water to an extent of 450 ml for every 150 gm of Black gram Dhal,<br>
d)	adding rice soji obtained from step (a) to the above said wet ground batter of soaked Black gram Dhal obtained from step (c) in a ratio ranging between 1.5:1 and 2.5:1 to obtain the batter,<br>
e)	fermenting the above said batter of step(d) for a period ranging from 12 to 14 hours at a temperature in the range of 28-32°C,<br>
f)	dehydrating the above said fermented batter as such or after mixing about 1 part of fermented batter with 1.2-1.5 parts of water or with a blend of rice flour and Black gram Dhal flour,<br>
g)	grinding the said fermented and dehydrated batter to powder form and<br>
a) mixing the above said powder batter obtained from step (g) with 0.9% leavening agent consisting of a mixture of 0.4% sodium bicarbonate and 0.5% of tartaric acid or sodium potassium tartrate to obtain the desired product.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of rice flour to Black gram dhal in blend used may be selected as 1:1.35.<br>
The process described here is soaking of polished rice and black gram in water for a known period of time and grinding them together in a wet grinder followed by keeping them for fermentation at room temperature (30°±2°C) for a period of 12 to 14 hours. The fermented batter is then either mixed with a known amount of water or blended with mix of the flours of rice and black gram dhal and dried at a temperature of around 50°C for a period of 2 to 4 hours. This is powdered to a particular mesh size (about 60 BSS) and reconstituted to prepare dosa with a proportion of 1:2.5 to 1:2.8 of ready mix to water and addition of salt to taste (generally 2 to 2.5% on the basis of the ready mix). A brief flow chart for preparation of dosa is as follows:<br>
(Flow Chart Removed)<br>
In the case of idli, black gram is soaked for about 3 hours and ground in a wet grinder to a fine paste / smooth batter. Idli soji is prepared with parboiled rice by a mechanical disintegrator. This soji is processed further by washing and draining off excess water and held for 15 minutes. It is subsequently mixed thoroughly with the batter of black gram dhal prepared as described earlier. The<br>
batter so prepared is fermented for about 12 to 14 hours and dried. The dried material is powdered to a particular mesh size (-18 + 60 BSS) and reconstituted in water for preparation of idli as practiced normally at homes ( proportion of mix to water is 1:2 with addition of salt as per taste. A brief flow diagram of the idli mix preparation is as follows:<br>
(Flow Chart Removed)<br>
The novelty of the process are:<br>
1.	Traditional fermentation of rice and black gram components are carried out.<br>
2.	The fermented batter is allowed to dry after appropriate dilution rather than drying the original batter as such. This hastens the process of dehydation.<br>
3.	Another variation the batter is mixed with a particular proportion of blend of rice and black gram dhal flours and allowed to dry, which will hasten the process of drying and also improve the sensory attributes of the products.<br>
4.	The dehydrated product obtained after fermentation and drying as above is ground appropriately.<br>
5.	The fermented and dehydrated mixes so obtained can be rehydrated into appropriate batters and prepare the products (idli/dosa) as traditionally practiced within minutes.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be considered to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1 (dosa)<br>
Rice and black gram dhal are soaked for 4 to 5 hours, after which the excess water is decanted, collected and the same is used while wet grinding The soaked material is ground in a wet grinder with addition of decanted water obtained as above. The batter obtained is left for about 12 to 14 hrs (fermentation) at 30 ± 2° C. The batter so obtained is diluted with water in a proportion of 1:1.35 (water to batter ratio) and dried in a tray drier at around 50°<br>
C for a period of 3 to 4 hrs. The dried product so obtained is powdered by mechanical meansl to obtain a powder to pass through 60 BSS mesh sieve to yield fermented, dehydrated, ready to use dosa mix. This mix is reconstituted with 2.5 to 2.8 times water with addition of salt to taste. Dosa is prepared from this reconstituted batter in the usual way. The dosa so prepared has good 'eye' formation and texture properties and comparable to the traditional product.<br>
Example 2 (Idli)<br>
Black gram dhal is soaked in water for about 2 hours, ground in a wet grinder for about 20 min. Normal parboiled rice is ground by mechanical means and sieved to get a semolina / soji to pass through 18 mesh sieve and retained on 60 mesh sieve (-18 + 60 BSS mesh sieve). The soji is washed with water, decanted and kept for about 15 min. This soaked soji is mixed with the black gram batter. The batter is kept for fermentation for about 12 to 14 hrs at 30° C ± 2° C. This fermented batter is dried as such at 50° C for 2 to 3 hrs. Alternatively, fermented batter is mixed with soji in the proportion of 11.5 : 1 (batter to soji) and dried for 2 to 3 hours at 50° C. The dried batter is powdered by mechanical means to pass through 18 mesh sieve and retained on 60 mesh sieve (- 18 + 60 BSS mesh sieve). This is fermented and dehydrated idli mix. The dry mix so obtained is mixed with a mixture of leavening agents consisting of 0.4% of sodium bicarbonate and 0.5% of tartaric acid /sodium potassium tartrate. This fermented and dehydrated idli mix is reconstituted with water in the ratio of 1 : 2 (mix and water) and steamed for 15 minutes at atmospheric pressure to get the idli which is comparable to the traditional product.<br>
Example 3 (Idli)<br>
Rice and Black gram are soaked separately for about 4 to 5 hours. They are ground separately and mixed together for fermentation for about 12 to 14 hours at 30° ± 2° C. The fermented batter is dried at 50° C for about 5 to 6 hours. The dried batter is powdered by mechanical means. The product so obtained is called as fermented and dehydrated idli mix. Idli prepared from this mix is not good with respect to texture (without requisite porousness and also a sticky product) and also did not have good appearance.<br>
Example 4 (dosa)<br>
Rice and black gram dhal are soaked for 4 to 5 hours. Water decanted and ground in a wet grinder. The batter is centrifuged and supernatant discarded (lot of solubles have been lost). The residue is dried in tray drier, 5 to 6 hours duration, but drying takes still longer time. The dried batter is ground by mechanical means but after reconstitution, the dosa had lost the texture, flavour and sensory scores are not good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
