ARRESTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present: invention relates to an arrester which is<br>
provided with a stack (hereinafter called "arrester elements<br>
stack") of plurality of nonlinear resistance element<br>
(hereinafter called "arrester element") containing a zinc oxide<br>
as the main component. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to the arrester which is able to ensure an interfacial<br>
pressure between an insertion hole of a bushing and a molded<br>
rubber including the arrester element stack, and to prevent the<br>
generation of gap.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In general, in gas insulated switchgear installed in<br>
a power plant or a substation and so on, an arrester is arranged<br>
to protect electric equipments such as switchgears or<br>
transformers from abnormal voltage which invades through the<br>
power cable line when the thunderbolt and so on occurs.<br>
[0003]<br>
Heretofore, as the arrester of this type, as shown in<br>
Fig.4, the arrester that the arrester elements stack 100 is<br>
attached vertically on the bottom 110a of the tank 110 filling<br>
insulation gas, and which is supported through the insulation<br>
supporting tube 120 is known (for example, refer to non-patent<br>
document No.l) . Or as shown in Fig.5, the arrester that the<br>
bushing 220 is attached to the inner wall of the equipment case<br>
210 hermetically, and that the arrester elements stack 230 is<br><br><br>
provided removably in this bushing 220 is known (for example,<br>
refer to patent document No.l) . In Fig.4, the numeral 140 shows<br>
an eccentric shield of high-voltage side, the numeral 150 shows<br>
an insulation spacer, the numeral 160 shows an instrumentation<br>
box and the numeral 170 shows an adsorbent.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the former arrester, it is necessary to set<br>
large-scale shield 130 on a high-voltage side of the arrester<br>
elements stack 100 in order to equalize the voltage distribution<br>
of the arrester element which constitutes the arrester elements<br>
stack 100. Therefore, there is a difficult point that the<br>
equipment itself becomes large. And, when the withstand voltage<br>
test of the gas insulated switchgear (hereinafter called "GIS")<br>
having the arrester elements stack 100 is performed, because<br>
the arrester elements stack 100 must be separated from the main<br>
circuit conductor (not shown in the drawing), it is necessary<br>
to arrange the separating device (not shown in the drawing).<br>
Therefore, there is a difficult point that the structure of the<br>
equipment becomes complex.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the one hand, in the latter arrester, because it is<br>
not necessary to arrange the separating device, the structure<br>
of the equipment becomes simple. And, when the withstand voltage<br>
test of the GIS is performed, it is not necessary to perform<br>
the operation of collecting or filling insulation gas of the<br>
inside of the equipment case 210 . However, because the equipment<br>
case 210 as an earthed electrode exists in an outer circumference<br>
of a portion of the arrester elements stack 230, it is difficult<br>
to equalize the voltage distribution of the arrester element<br>
230a. Therefore, there is a difficult point that its application<br><br><br>
is restricted to the power cable line for the medium voltage<br>
of approximately 22/33kV.<br>
[0006]<br>
For this reason, previously, as shown in Fig.6, the<br>
present inventors developed the arrester (hereinafter called<br>
"gas tank type arrester in GIS") which is provided with the<br>
bushing 320 and the molded arrester elements stack 340, and filed<br>
(Patent application number 2004-357915). The bushing 320 is<br>
hermetically installed to the opened section 310 of the equipment<br>
case 300 which houses the electric equipment, and comprises the<br>
epoxy resin. The molded arrester elements stack 340 is removably<br>
installed into the insertion hole 330 of the bushing 320 from<br>
the outside of the equipment case 300.<br>
[0007]<br>
Here, the molded arrester elements stack 340 consists of<br>
the arrester elements stack 350 which stacks plurality of the<br>
arrester element 350a and the molded rubber 360 comprising the<br>
silicone rubber which is arranged at the outer circumference<br>
of the aforementioned arrester elements stack 350. And, the<br>
bushing 320 which houses the molded rubber 360 is provided with<br>
an upper-end-closed cylindrical portion (hereinafter called<br>
"cylindrical portion for tip") 321 having the insertion hole<br>
(hereinafter called "insertion hole for tip") 321a to house a<br>
column-shaped tip 340a of the molded arrester elements stack<br>
340, a cylindrical portion (hereinafter called "cylindrical<br>
portion for back-end") 322 having the insertion hole<br>
(hereinafter called "insertion hole for back-end") 322a to house<br>
a column-shaped back-end 340b of the molded arrester elements<br>
stack 340, and a cylindrical portion (hereinafter called<br>
"cylindrical portion for intermediate section") 323 having the<br><br><br>
tapered insertion hole (hereinafter called "tapered insertion<br>
hole") 323a to house a conically-shaped portion 340c which is<br>
arranged in the intermediate section of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 340.<br>
[0008]<br>
According to the gas tank type arrester in 6IS of such<br>
composition, because the whole of the molded arrester elements<br>
stack 340 is housed in the inside of the insertion hole 330 of<br>
the bushing 320, it is applicable to the power line of the voltage<br>
rank higher than the conventional arrester. And, because the<br>
molded rubber 360 is pressured toward the tip of the bushing<br>
320, the inter facial pressure between the tapered inner surface<br>
of the tapered insertion hole 323a of the bushing 320 and the<br>
tapered outer surface of the conically-shaped portion 340c which<br>
constitutes the molded rubber 360 is ensured, therefore, it is<br>
possible to prevent the dielectric breakdown in the interface.<br>
[0009]<br>
More concretely, a spring 370 is arranged at the<br>
back-end portion of the molded arrester elements stack 340 and<br>
the spring 370 is compressed to an axial direction by a sealing<br>
cover 390 arranged at the back-end portion of the bushing 320.<br>
Therefore, the tapered outer surface of the conically-shaped<br>
portion 340c which constitutes the molded rubber 360 is pressured<br>
to the tapered inner surface of the tapered insertion hole 323a<br>
of the bushing 320. Consequently, the insulating performance<br>
of the interface between the tapered outer surface of the<br>
conically-shaped portion 340c of the molded rubber 360 and the<br>
tapered inner surface of the tapered insertion hole 323a of the<br>
bushing 320 is ensured.<br>
[0010]<br><br><br>
On the one hand, an imperceptible gap tends to be made in<br>
a neighborhood of a consecutively-installed portion P between<br>
the conically-shaped portion 340c of the molded rubber 360 and<br>
the tip 340a of the molded rubber 360. Therefore, in the gas<br>
tank type arrester in 6IS of such composition, a triple junction<br>
on which the bushing 320 (epoxy resin) , air (the imperceptible<br>
gap in the neighborhood of the consecutively-installed portion<br>
P) and the molded rubber 360 (silicone rubber) abut is not<br>
shielded completely by a high voltage shielding electrode 380.<br>
Consequently, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, because an electric<br>
field goes around toward the triple junction P side, there was<br>
a difficult point that a partial discharge occurs in the air<br>
(gap) of the aforementioned triple junction.<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022]<br>
According to the arrester from first feature to ninth<br>
feature of this invention, there are following effects.<br>
[0023]<br>
First, because the molded arrester elements stack is<br>
removably installed to the bushing which is hermetically<br>
arranged at the opened section of the equipment case from the<br>
outside of the equipment case, it is not necessary to arrange<br>
the separation device as hitherto known gas insulated type<br>
arrester. Therefore, the simplification of the structure of the<br>
equipment is possible. And, the operation of collecting or<br>
filling the insulating gas of the inside of the equipment case<br>
can not be required when changing the arrester elements.<br>
[0024]<br>
Second, because the outer circumference of the tip of<br><br><br>
the molded arrester elements stack is covered by the high voltage<br>
shielding electrode, the equalization of the voltage<br>
distribution of the arrester elements is possible, and<br>
consequently, it is possible to provide the arrester which can<br>
apply to the high-voltage power cable line of the 66/77kV class.<br>
[0025]<br>
Third, because a part of the molded arrester elements<br>
stack is led to the outside of the equipment case, the<br>
miniaturization of the equipment can be attempted.<br>
[0026]<br>
Fourth, because the back-end of the bushing is led to<br>
the outside of the equipment case hermetically, the<br>
simplification, the downsizing, and the weight-saving of the<br>
structure of the equipment can be attempted.<br>
[0027]<br>
Fifth, because the tapered portion is arranged at the<br>
portion where the electric field of the insertion hole of the<br>
bushing concentrates, the interfacial pressure between the<br>
insertion hole of the bushing and the molded rubber can be ensured,<br>
and the generation of the gap can be prevented, and consequently,<br>
the occurrence of the partial discharge in the interface portion<br>
can be inhibited.<br>

[0041]<br>
The numeral F shows the sealing cover which is arranged to the<br>
back-end surface of the cylindrical portion for back-end 52 of the bushing<br>
2, and aforementioned sealing cover F is constituted by the circular<br>
plate-shaped metal fitting such as aluminum iretal fitting. Regarding the<br>
sealing cover F, a column-shaped boss portion Fa which is possible to<br>
connect by insetting into a large diameter concave groove portion 65e<br>
of tile pressure metal fitting 65 is provided so as to protrude at the<br>
center portion of the upper surface side (face-to-face side to bushing<br>
2) of itself. And, for example eight bolt insertion holes (not shown in<br>

at regular interval at the neighborhood of the outer edge of itself.<br>
Further, an annular concave groove (not shown in the drawing) to house<br>
an O-ring P2 is provided concentrically with the insertion hole for<br>
back-end 52a at the upper surface side. Besides, the annular concave groove<br>
(not shown in the drawing) is provided at the outer circumference of the<br>
boss portion Fa, and the tape-shaped electrical contact (not shown in<br>
the drawing) is fitted in this annular concave groove. The numeral V3<br>
shows the bolt for attaching an earthing conductor (not shown in the<br>
drawing) .<br>
[0042]<br>
Next, the method for installing the molded arrester elements stack<br>
6 removably in the bushing 2 is explained.<br>
[0043]<br>
First, the coiled high-voltage side spring 63 of the almost same<br>
17<br><br>
diameter as the inner diameter of the cylindrical portion 62b is installed<br>
in the inside of the cylindrical portion 62b of the joint conductor 62<br>
so that the upper half portion of the coiled high-voltage side spring<br>
63 protrudes. In this state, the tip (high-voltage side) of the molded<br>
arrester elements stack 6 is inserted into the inside of the bushing 2,<br>
and is pushed until the tip of the high-voltage side spring 63 abuts on<br>
an inner wall surface 43a of the main circuit connection terminal 43.<br>
Therefore, an individual piece (not shown in the drawing) which<br>
constitutes the electrical contact (multi-contact) which is arranged at<br>
the concave groove 62c contacts electrically to the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the joint conductor insertion portion 42. Besides, the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the tip 67a of the molded rubber 67 abuts on the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the insertion hole for tip 51a of the bushing<br>
2, and the outer peripheral surface of the conically-shaped portion 67b<br>
of the molded rubber 67 abuts on the inner peripheral surface of the tapered<br>
insertion hole 53a of the bushing 2, and the outer peripheral surface<br>
of the back-end 67c of the molded rubber 67 abuts on the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the insertion hole for back-end 52a.<br>
[0044]<br>
Next, the coiled low-voltage side spring 66 of the almost same<br>
diameter as the inner diameter of the concave groove portion 65c is<br>
installed in the concave groove portion 65c of the pressure metal fitting<br>
65	so that the lower half portion of the coiled low-voltage side spring<br>
66	protrudes, and the O-ring P2 comprising such as fluorine-containing<br>
rubber is arranged in a concave groove F2a. In this state, the sealing<br>
cover F is abutted on the lower surface of the cylindrical portion for<br>
back-end 52 of the bushing 2, and further, the tip of the bolts V2 which<br>
is inserted into the bolt insertion holes of the sealing cover F is screwed<br>
into an embedded matal fittings N which is embedded to the lower surface<br>
of the cylindrical portion for back-end 52. Therefore, the sealing cover<br><br><br>
F is attached to the lower surface of the cylindrical portion for back-end<br>
52.<br>
[0045]<br>
By abutting on and fixing of such the sealing cover F to the lower<br>
surface of the cylindrical portion for back-end 52, the insertion hole<br>
for back-end 52a of the bushing 2 is sealed by the 0-ring P2, and the<br>
low-voltage side spring 66 is pressured to the axial direction. Because<br>
a predetermined spring force is given to the low-voltage side spring 66,<br>
the molded rubber 67 is pressured toward the tip of the bushing 2, and<br>
a predetermined interfacial pressure is given to a fitting portion between<br>
the inner peripheral surface of the tapered insertion hole 53a of the<br>
bushing 2 and the outer peripheral surface of comically-shaped portion<br>
67b of the molded rubber 67.<br>
[0046]<br>
Besides, because the molded rubber 67 is pressured<br>
toward the tip of the bushing 2, the high-voltage side spring<br>
63 which is arranged at the tip of the molded rubber 67 is<br>
pressured to the axial direction, and the predetermined spring<br>
force is given to the aforementioned high-voltage side spring<br>
63. Therefore, the predetermined interf acial pressure is given<br>
between the arrester element 61a and the joint conductor 62,<br>
between the arrester elements 61a, and between the arrester<br>
element 61a and the pressure portion 65b. Consequently, these members<br>
contact certainly.<br>
[0047]<br>
As described above, according to the arrester of such<br>
composition, because the whole of the molded arrester elements<br>
stack 6 is housed in the inside of the insertion hole 3a of the<br>
bushing 2, as described later, it is possible to apply to the<br>
higher voltage power line than the hitherto known arrester.<br><br><br>
Besides, because the molded rubber is pressured toward the tip<br>
of the bushing, the interfacial pressure between the inner<br>
surface of the tapered insertion hole 53a of the bushing 2 and<br>
the outer surface of the conically-shaped portion 67b of the<br>
molded rubber 67 is ensured, and the dielectric breakdown of<br>
the interface can be prevented. More concretely, because the<br>
spring is arranged at the back-end of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack and the spring force is given to the<br>
aforementioned spring, the molded arrester elements stack can<br>
be pressured toward the tip of the bushing. And, because the<br>
inner surface of the tapered insertion hole 53a of the bushing<br>
2 and the outer surface of the conically-shaped portion 67b of<br>
the molded rubber 67 fit in, the press force of the axial<br>
direction can be operated effectively as the interfacial<br>
pressure. And further, because the tapered insertion hole 53a<br>
(conically-shaped portion 67b) that the surface pressure<br>
operates effectively to the inside of the end portion E of the<br>
low-voltage direction of the high voltage shielding electrode<br>
where the electric field concentrates is arranged, as described<br>
later, the occurrence of the partial discharge in the interface<br>
portion can be prevented.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig.2 shows the equipotential distribution drawing of<br>
the arrester in this embodiment. From this drawing, the tip of<br>
the molded arrester elements stack 6 is shielded by the high<br>
voltage shielding electrode 4, and the back-end of the molded<br>
arrester elements stack 6 is arranged at the outside of the<br>
equipment case 1 which is the earthed electrode, further, the<br>
electric field of the intermediate section of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 6 is controlled appropriately by adjusting the<br><br><br>
interval between the high voltage shielding electrode 4 and the<br>
equipment case 1 as the earthed electrode. Therefore, the voltage<br>
which is distributed by the arrester elements is equalized in<br>
the longer direction.<br>
[0049]<br>
Here, the influence that the shielding body 41 and the<br>
equipment case 1 which is the earthed electrode give to the molded<br>
arrester elements stack 6 is explained. First, when the interval<br>
between the end portion E of the low voltage direction of the<br>
shielding body 41 and the high voltage side surface of the<br>
equipment case 1 is short, there is a relation that the electric<br>
field in the intermediate section of the molded arrester elements<br>
stack 6 becomes dense by the influence of the shielding body<br>
41 and the equipment case 1, and, to the contrary, when the<br>
interval of both is long, there is a relation that the electric<br>
field in the aforementioned intermediate section becomes coarse.<br>
Therefore, in the structure which the interval of both only<br>
expands, it is difficult to equalize the voltage distribution<br>
of the arrester element 61a. On this point, in this embodiment,<br>
the tip (length of about one-third of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 6) of the molded arrester elements stack 6 and<br>
the intermediate section (length of about one-third of the molded<br>
arrester elements stack 6) of the molded arrester elements stack<br>
6 are located in the inside of the equipment case 1, and the<br>
back-end (length of about one-third of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 6) of the molded arrester elements stack 6 is<br>
located at the outside of the equipment case 1. Therefore, the<br>
interval between the high-voltage shielding electrode 4 and the<br>
equipment case 1 which is the earthed electrode is adjusted<br>
appropriately, and it is possible to control the electric field<br><br><br>
appropriately in the intermediate section of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 6. Consequently, the equalization of the voltage<br>
distribution of the arrester element 61a can be attempted.<br>
[0050]<br>
As described above, according to the arrester of this invention,<br>
because it is possible to install the molded arrester elements stack 6<br>
removably from the outside of the equipment case 1 into the bushing 2<br>
which is attached hermetically at the opened section la of the equipment<br>
case 1, it is not necessary to arrange the separation device as hitherto<br>
known gas insulated type arrester, and it is possible to simplify the<br>
structure of the equipment, besides, it is not necessary to perform the<br>
operation of collecting or filling the insulation gas of the inside of<br>
the equipment case 1 when the exchange of the arrester elements is<br>
performed. Further, because the outer circumference of the tip of the<br>
molded arrester elements stack 6 is covered by the high voltage shielding<br>
electrode 4, the equalization of the voltage distribution of the arrester<br>
element 61a can be performed, consequently, it is possible to provide<br>
the arrester which can apply to the high voltage power cable line of the<br>
66/77KV class. And, because the back-end side (low-voltage side) of the<br>
molded arrester elements stack 6 is led to the outside of the equipment<br>
case 1, the miniaturization of the equipment can be attempted. Further,<br>
the tapered insertion hole 53a is arranged in the insertion hole 3a of<br>
tiie bushing 2 for the section from the portion S' corresponding to the<br>
top S of the high voltage shielding electrode 4, that is, from the portion<br>
S' which is located at the high-voltage side (tip side) by looking from<br>
the portion E' corresponding to the end portion E of the low-voltage<br>
direction of the high voltage shielding electrode 4 to the portion 1'<br>
corresponding to the neighborhood of the high-voltage side of the<br>
equipment case 1, and the conically-shaped portion 67b which fits in the<br>
tapered insertion hole 53a is arranged in the molded rubber 67. Therefore,<br><br><br>
the interfacial pressure between the insertion hole of the bushing and<br>
the molded rubber in the region where the electric field concentrates<br>
can be ensured, and the generation of the gap can be prevented,<br>
consequently, the occurrence of the partial discharge in the interface<br>
of the both portion can be inhibited.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
Fig. 3 shows the partial sectional view of the arrester in the second<br>
embodiment of this invention. In this drawing, the same numerals are given<br>
to the portions which are common to Fig.l, and detailed explanation is<br>
omitted.<br>
[0051]<br>
In Fig.3, in this embodiment, instead of the insertion hole 3a<br>
of bushing shown in Fig. 1, the tapered insertion hole 53a' which extends<br>
comically from the high-voltage side toward the low-voltage side of the<br>
bushing for the section from the tip of the bushing 2 to the back-end<br>
of the bushing 2 is provided. And, a conieally-shaped portion 67b' which<br>
fits in the inner surface of the tapered insertion hole 53a' is provided<br>
in the molded rubber 67.<br>
[0052]<br>
Also in this embodiment as well as aforementioned embodiment, it<br>
is not necessary to arrange the separation device, and it is possible<br>
to simplify the structure of the equipment. Besides, it is not necessary<br>
to perform the operation of collecting or filling the insulating gas of<br>
the inside of the equipment case 1 when the exchange of the arrester<br>
elements is performed. Further, because the equalization of the voltage<br>
distribution of the arrester element 61a can be performed, it is possible<br>
to provide the arrester which can apply to the high voltage power cable<br>
line of 66/77kV class. And, because a part <low-voltage side of the molded></low-voltage>
arrester elements stack 6 is led to the outside of the equipment case<br>
1, the miniaturization of the equipment can be attempted. Besides, the<br><br><br>
tapered insertion hole 53a' is provided over all region from the tip of<br>
bushing to the back-end of bushing, and the <xaiically-shapedportion></xaiically-shapedportion>
of the molded arrester elements stack 6 is constituted so as to fit in<br>
the tapered insertixai hole 53a'. therefore, the interfacial pressure of<br>
the both can be ensured over the entire length of the molded arrester<br>
elements stack 6, and the generation of the gap can be prevented.<br>
Consequently, it is possible to provide the arrester which has more<br>
superior insulating performance than the aforementioned embodiment.<br>
