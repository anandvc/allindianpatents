				<td>Process for Preparing Particles Containing an Antiviral<br>
This invention concerns a process for preparing particles containing antiviral pyrimidines and triazines in the form of a co-precipitate, particles prepared by this process, and pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising these particles.<br>
An increasing number of active ingredients having interesting pharmacological activities are hard to formulate into standard oral formulations. This because increased structural complexity or the presence of lipophilic moieties results in a very limited solubility in aqueous media and concomitant reduced or even in some cases absent absorption of the active ingredient in the gastro-intestinal tract. This typically translates into an impaired or a very low bioavailability so that high doses of the active need to be administered to patients in order to achieve effective concentration levels. Therefore a single dose administration may be insufficient for the drug to be effective requiring a multi-dose administration either at once or by a multiple daily dosing, or both.<br>
Since long, formulations have been developed aimed at overcoming these problems. Among these, solid dispersions of active ingredients have been found to be particularly attractive in that they often provide considerable improvement in the solubility and concomitant bioavailability of the active ingredients formulated in this manner. Solid dispersions in general consist of an active ingredient that is dispersed in a hydrophilic medium, usually a polymer.<br>
Solid dispersions are usually obtained using two methods. On the one hand they can be obtained via evaporation of a solution consisting of the active ingredient and an inert polymeric material, and on the other via co-fusion of the aforementioned components, with subsequent solidification. In the former instance, the resulting product is referred to as co-precipitate, in the latter as co-melt. Depending on the preparation technique used, co-precipitates can be a solid mass, but they can also be made in particulate form. Solid dispersions in particulate form have become attractive formulation forms for active ingredients with problematic bioavailabilty.<br>
Solid dispersions in particulate form face a number of challenges. First of all they should allow the highest possible level of dissolution and release of the active ingredient in order to ensure sufficient and effective bioavailability thereof.<br>
Secondly, the particles preferably should have a narrow particle size distribution and be of a size that is appropriate for the preparation of dosage forms for oral administration, while containing sufficient high levels of the active ingredient.<br>
Thirdly, the particles should be sufficiently stable over time and able to withstand unfavorable temperature and humidity conditions, such as those commonly used in stability studies, for example storage for extended periods of time at 30°C/60% RH (Relative Humidity), or at 40°C/75% RH.<br>
In certain cases, a solid dispersion in itself is not sufficient to guarantee a sufficient level of bioavailability and of effectiveness of the active ingredient that needs to be administered. To that purpose a number of improvements have been proposed such as the addition of certain ingredients. International patent application WO 97/04749 concerns a preparation process for solid dispersions wherein the active ingredient(s) is/are dissolved in an organic solvent otherwise containing a highly hydrophilic cyclic amide, and advantageously a surface active agent, with the resulting organic solution subsequently evaporated dry, then milled and sieved. The cyclic amide is a polyvinylpyrrolidone with a molecular weight that varies between 10,000 and 50,000.<br>
Certain classes of pyrimidines and triazines have been disclosed in WO-99/50250, WO-99/50256, WO-00/27825 and WO-03/016306 as potent HIV-inhibiting agents. Many of these compounds, in particular those lacking solubilizing groups such as carboxyl or amino groups, have low to very low solubility and need to be formulated in specially adapted formulations in order to provide sufficient bioavailabilty. Providing formulations for oral dosage forms that deliver an effective amount of these active ingredients poses a particular challenge. This is even more critical given the fact that these active ingredients are HIV-inhibiting agents where it is an absolute requirement that blood plasma levels surpass a certain threshold, which marks the level under which the active no longer is effective amount so that the virus is adequately suppressed thereby avoiding mutations.<br>
WO-01/22938 is concerned with pharmaceutical compositions of pyrimidine and triazine antiviral compounds, in particular the pyrimidines and triazines mentioned above, comprising particles obtainable by melt-extruding a mixture comprising one or more antiviral compounds and one or more appropriate water-soluble polymers and subsequently milling said melt-extruded mixture. A disadvantage associated with melt-extrusion is that the components need to be heated to obtain a homogenous melt so that the active ingredient may be subject to degradation.<br>
The pyrimidine and triazine antivirals mentioned above need to be administered in unit doses containing relatively high amounts of active ingredient, for example amounts which are in the range of 100 mg to 800 mg per unit dose requiring relatively high<br>
amounts of solid dispersion forming polymer. Solid dispersions in particle form containing these active ingredients pose a particular challenge in that a lot of material has to be sprayed on an inert core of restricted size. Indeed, the size of the core is limited because otherwise too much of the core material is present in the end formulation giving rise to unpractically large dosage forms. Moreover particles on which a lot of material has been spayed on tend to agglomerate and therefore are much more difficult to further process.<br>
The present invention is aimed at overcoming these problems in that it provides processes for preparing formulations comprising particles wherein a co-precipitate is applied as a layer surrounding a neutral hydrophilic core and wherein the co-precipitate comprises, at least one HIV-inhibitory pyrimidine or triazine, one surface-active agent, and one hydrophilic polymer. These particles show improved bioavailability of active ingredients even when almost insoluble in aqueous media, and increase both the dissolution rate and the amount of active ingredient that is released in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The layer surrounding the neutral hydrophilic carrier is a solid dispersion comprising a co-precipitate, which is soluble in water or in physiological media, such as for example in gastric juice.<br>
The particles prepared according to the process of this invention have the additional advantage of improving the problem of particle agglomeration that is frequently faced when spraying large quantities of coating solutions, by grinding the particles not only after finalization of the spraying step, but also during this step.<br>
The size reduction resulting from grinding thus allows to continue spraying on particles of smaller size, that are less likely to agglomerate than particles obtained in a single spraying step with a continuous increase of particle size.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention concerns a process for preparing a particle comprising a co-precipitate surrounding a neutral hydrophilic carrier, said process comprising spraying an organic solution on a neutral hydrophilic carrier, said solution comprising at least one triazine or pyrimidine active ingredient having HIV inhibiting properties, one surface active agent, and one hydrophilic polymer, wherein the spraying of whole of the solution occurs in at least two separate steps, each of these steps followed by a grinding step of the product obtained at the end of the preceding step.<br>
In a particular aspect, the present invention concerns the preparation of particles comprising a co-precipitate surrounding a neutral hydrophilic carrier comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	preparing a solution comprising at least one triazine or pyrimidine active ingredient having HIV inhibiting properties, a hydrophilic polymer, and a surface active agent, in an organic solvent;<br>
b)	spraying part of the solution obtained in step a) on a neutral hydrophilic carrier;<br>
c)	grinding of the particles obtained in step b);<br>
d)	spraying of the remaining quantity of organic solution on the particles obtained in step c) carrier, and<br>
e)	final grinding of the particles obtained in step d).<br>
The spraying/grinding sequence (steps b to d) may be done once, or repeated several times, depending on the volume of the solution intended for spraying and the growth kinetics of the particle during the course of the spraying step.<br>
The carrier used in the process of the invention preferably takes the form of neutral hydrophilic particles, which function as a core on which the solution as specified herein containing the pyrimidine or triazine active ingredient, is sprayed.<br>
All of the organic solution may be prepared in a single step. However, in order to avoid excess evaporation of the organic solvents, it is preferable to prepare each fraction of the solution just prior to the spraying step.<br>
Spraying of the organic solution may be carried out in a conventional fluidized bed drier equipped with a spraying device using the top or bottom spraying process.In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, all the spraying steps are carried out in a fluidized bed, equipped with an anti-deflagration device.<br>
In certain embodiments, in particular in case of larger batches, the material obtained after grinding (as in step c)), may de partitioned in two or more parts, preferably of equal size. Each part may then be sprayed separately (as in step d)) and ground, whereupon all the resulting material is blended. In alternative embodiments, each of the parts, after spaying (as in step d)) may be ground with a different grinder. The selection of these variants can be done to optimize particle size and particle size distribution.<br>
The fluidized bed is equipped with a spraying nozzle, the position and orientation of which may be selected such that it enables control over the kinetics of the growth of the<br>
particles and avoids problems of sticking, linked to the type of active ingredient, to the qualitative and quantitative composition of the sprayed coating solution, and to various parameters of the procedure (e.g. temperature, air pressure, and the rate of spraying).<br>
The particles are dried after spraying of the organic solution. Drying may be carried out on trays, or directly inside the equipment used in the spraying step or in a tumble drier. Drying may be carried out either just after spraying of the organic solution, or immediately following the grinding of particles.<br>
Grinding may be carried out using any type of equipment designed for this particular purpose, and may include use of an oscillating or a blade type grinder. Examples are the FITZMILL rotation type grinder, or the FREWITT oscillating type grinder that are equipped with rotors that force particles through a grid with calibrated openings. The FORPLEX is stator rotor grinder type equipped with pins to which particles are projected at a certain feed rate. The type of grinder and the grinding parameters, e.g. speed of grinding, will define the final particle size and particle size distribution.<br>
Different grinders may be used after each spraying step. Moreover, grinding may be done partially on one type of grinder and finished on another type of grinder. All these variants are selected to determine the size and size distribution of the product after grinding.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly useful for active ingredients that are almost insoluble in water, that is for active ingredients where one part is soluble in 1000 parts of water, or more than 1000 parts of water, more in particular for active ingredients that are practically insoluble in water, that is for active ingredients of which one part is soluble in 10,000 parts of water, or more than 10,000 parts of water.<br>
The triazine or pyrimidine active ingredient having HIV inhibiting properties for use in the process of the present invention and in the products obtained therewith preferably is a triazine or pyrimidine derivative that has low solubility in water or aqueous media. Low solubility in this context refers to a compound having a solubility of less than 2 mg/ml or less than 1 mg/ml, or even lower, e.g. less than 0.5 mg/ml or 0.2 mg/ml or even 0.1 mg/ml. Low solubility of active ingredients moreover is meant to include active ingredients that are substantially insoluble, e.g. having a solubility below 0.05 mg/ml or even 0.01 mg/ml. Solubilities are in water or in usual aqueous media that are physiologically relevant (e.g. having a pH between 1 - 8). However, triazines or pyrimidines of higher solubility may be used as well, e.g. having solubilities up to 5 mg/ml or 10 mg/ml or even 20 mg/ml<br>
The triazine or pyrimidine active ingredients for use in the processes and resulting products of this invention in particular are those lacking ionizable groups, e.g. carboxyl or amine groups.<br>
Of interest are triazine or pyrimidine active ingredients disclosed in any of WO99/50250, WO99/50256, WO00/27825 or WO03/016306, either specifically or falling under any of the definitions specified in these patent applications, which applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
1.   Preparation of the particles<br>
Production was carried out on a GPCG1 fluidized bed in Bottom Spray mode.<br>
The spraying solution was prepared by dissolving TMC125 in a mixture of solvents 96% alcohol/methylene with HPMC 2910 5cPs (supplied by Dow Chemical) and polysorbate 20 (Montanox®20, supplied by SEPPIC).<br>
Lactose EFK (supplied by HMS) was introduced on the fluidized bed and the solution was sprayed in the bottom spray mode. The granules were dried on a fluidized bed and milled using a FITZMILL grinder with a 790-um grid .<br>
After the spraying step, the resulting granules were dried on the fluidized bed. Preparation of the spraying solution<br>
Composition of the spraying solutions<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Six batches of the spraying solutions (hereafter referred to as solutions 1 to 6) were made according to the following operating method:<br>
1.	Pour the alcohol and methylene chloride in the tank after weighing them in the<br>
same container<br>
2.	Put under stirring, add TMC125 and wait until complete dissolution<br>
3.	Dissolve Montanox 20 DF under stirring<br><br>
4.	Dissolve HPMC 2910 cPs under stirring until it is completely dissolved<br>
5.	Readjust the solution weight by adding methylene chloride to make up for the evaporation which occurred during the solution preparation.<br>
Solutions 1 &amp; 2 were prepared at first. Then, solutions 3 &amp; 4 and solutions 5 &amp; 6 were prepared respectively during the spraying of solutions 1 &amp; 2 and solutions 3 &amp; 4.<br>
Layering with solution 1 and 2<br>
1.	63 kg of Lactose EFK were introduced into the fluidized bed GPCG 120 and<br>
solutions 1 and 2 were sprayed. The granulates were then dried in the fluidized<br>
bed GPCG 120 for approximately fifteen minutes.<br>
2.	The granulates were sieved on a 1.60 mm screen after this first layering step.<br>
The undersized granulates were milled half part on a Fitzmill grinder equipped<br>
with a 790 urn screen and half part on a Forplex grinder to optimize the process<br>
time.<br>
3.	The oversized granulates were milled on a Fitzmill grinder equipped with a<br>
790 urn screen.<br>
4.	The resulting mass of granulates was then divided into two equivalent parts: Part<br>
A and Part B. Each part was composed of half of granulates milled with a<br>
Forplex grinder and half of granulates milled with a Fitzmill grinder to have an<br>
homogeneous particle size distribution.<br>
Lavering with solutions 3 and 4<br>
These two solutions were sprayed on part A. The resulting granulates were dried in the fluidized bed GPCG 120 for approximately one hour. They were then sieved on a 1.60 mm screen and the oversized were milled on a Fitzmill grinder equipped with a 790 µm screen and / or on a Forplex grinder.<br>
Layering with solutions 5 and 6<br>
These two solutions were sprayed on part B. The resulting granulates were dried in the fluidized bed GPCG 1120 for approximately one hour and sieved on a 1.60 mm screen. The oversized were milled on a Fitzmill grinder equipped with a 790 µm screen and / or on a Forplex grinder.<br>
Spraying rate for solutions 1 and 2 was set at about 3.00 kg/min, for solutions 3 and for (sprayed on part A) abourt 3.25 kg/min and for solutions 5 and 6 (sprayed on part B) also about 3.25 kg/min. Spraying pressure was 3.5 bar.<br>
Drying Step<br>
Parts A and B were dried at 80°C for about 72 hours.<br>
Milling Step<br>
The dry granulates were milled on a Forplex grinder. One cycle was sufficient to reach the desired particle size (between 150 to 300 µm).<br>
Final blend<br>
Blend all the milled granulates for 12 minutes at 10 rpm.<br>
Total Composition<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The resulting quantity of granulates was about 350 kg, yield about 95%.<br>
2. Results<br>
2.1 Granulometric distribution<br>
The granulometric distribution of various batches obtained by the above described<br>
procedures were in the following ranges :<br>
D,0%: 58-94 µm D50%: 229-267 µm D90%: 471-496 µm<br>
Example 2: Preparation of Tablets<br>
