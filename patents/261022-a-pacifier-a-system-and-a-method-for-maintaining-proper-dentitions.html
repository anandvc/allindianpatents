				<td>"A PACIFIER, A SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR MAINTAINING PROPER DENTITIONS"<br>
This application claims the benefit, of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.: 60/412,454, filed September 20, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pacifier, a system and a method for maintaining proper dentitions in a child. More specifically, the present invention relates to one or more pacifiers which may be used to prevent improper guidance of a developing dentition of a child and ease a pain associated with teething.<br>
It is generally known to provide a pacifier to a child. Pacifiers are used by infants and young children as a substitute for sucking instincts the child may develop. However, use of a pacifier often becomes a habit for a child. As a result, use of the pacifier may cause defects in a developing dentition, oral formation or facial appearance of the child.<br>
For example, a child sucking on a pacifier may cause constriction or narrowing of an upper jaw which often results in a cross-bite of the dentition. Another negative effect of pacifier usage may be protrusion cf the upper front teeth or a jaw discrepancy. An open bite, speech problems, swallowing problems or temporomandibular joint problems may also be negative effects of. pacifier usage.<br>
Passive use of a pacifier, such as, for example, during a period when the deciduous incisors are erupting, may also cause problems, such as, for example, an anterior open bite. If the deciduous anterior open bite is not prevented or treated, a child may also develop a permanent incisal open-bite at six to eight years of age and may  develop,  for  example,  abnormal permanent<br>
allowing, breathing and/or speech problems. For a c ild, a period between an age of eighteen months and six years of age is critical to developing dentitions. Often, a poor pattern of development established during this childhood period causes the child to have a defective adult dentition that is nearly impossible to correct at older ages.<br>
A second problem associated with the use of a pacifier is an occurrence of teething of the child. The child may be frustrated when wearing the pacifier. The pain may discourage the child from wearing the pacifier and may prevent the pacifier from providing a substitute for sucking instincts.<br>
A need, therefore, exists for a pacifier, a system and a method for developing and maintaining proper deciduous dentitions in a child wherein the pacifier guides the incoming deciduous teeth of a child intc a normal dentition and a normal pattern of jaw development to create an ideal environment for a later eruption of permanent teeth after six years of age. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pacifier, a system and a method for maintaining proper dentitions in a child. The present invention also relates to a method for relieving a pain associated with teething. The pacifier may have a bulb or false nipple that may be connected to an external shield. A child may suck on the bulb. An isthmus may be provided to connect the bulb and the external shield. The child may bite down on the connecting isthmus. The isthmus may be wider from sice-to-side and may extend laterally to encompass erupting deciduous lateral incisors. Moreover, the isthmus may be flat and may have a thickness which may be less thar. a thickness of connectors associated with known pacifiers. Because the isthmus extends from the external shield to<br>
the bulb or false nipple, the pacifier may prevent the child from developing, for example, an open bite or other malocclusion.<br>
The pacifier may have a thicker cushion at the rear of the isthmus to contact the gums of the child when the pacifier is worn. The isthmus may be sized from front to back to fit between the lips, and may have a cushion or pillow at the rear to put pressure against the gums to relieve the pain associated with teething.<br>

DETAITLED INSCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to a pacifier, a system and a method for maintaining proper dentitions in a child.  The pacifier may have a bulb which may be<br>
connlected to an external shield An isthmus, or connector, may be provided to connect the bulb and the external shield. A child may bite down on the bulb and the connector when the pacifier is worn in the mouth. Known pacifiers may have a rounded connector. However, the isthmus provided in the present invention may be flat and may have a thickness which may be less than a thickness of connectors associated with the known pacifiers. As a result, when a child uses the pacifier of the present invention, the reduced thickness of the isthmus may prevent the child from developing, for example, an open bite or other malocclusion.<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts, Figure 1 illustrates a known pacifier 2 which may be used by a child during a period between birth to approximately two to four years of age. The pacifier 2 has a bulb 8 which the child sucks on. The pacifier 2 also has an external shield 6 connected to the bulb 8 by a rounded connector 4 which the child often bites upon.<br>
The pacifier 2 may prevent a child from sucking habits, such as, for example, placing fingers or a thumb within the mouth. Between the age of six months and nine months, the first deciduous incisors of the child, specifically the upper and lower centrals, may begin to erupt. However, use of the pacifier 2 may stop the first deciduous incisors from fully erupting into the mouth due to a thickness 5 of the rounded connector 4. Upper lateral deciduous incisors and lower lateral deciduous incisors may erupt from a time period between the ages of nine month and twelve months. Use of the pacifier 2 may also stop the upper lateral deciduous incisors and the lower lateral deciduous incisors from erupting completely, and from assuming an upright position caused by the rounded connector 4.<br>
At a time when a child is eighteen months old, the upper deciduous canines and the lower deciduous canines and/or the first deciduous molars erupt and are allowed to erupt more completely without any interference because of an absence of the connector 4 present between the upper canines and the lower canines and molars. If the connector 4 is present in the pacifier 2, the connector may interfere with eruption of the upper incisors and the lower incisors. Therefore, the canines and the molars erupt more completely than the incisors which enhance an anterior open bite. As a result, a child using the pacifier 2 of Figure 1 may have an anterior open bite 52, such as that illustrated in Figure 5A. Prolonged use of the pacifier 2 may also prevent the lower jaw from developing in a forward direction. A child may then have a facial profile 141, illustrated in Figure 4A, wherein a jaw relation 142 may have a protrusion of the upper front teeth. Moreover, the jaw relation 142 may have a jaw discrepancy where the upper and lower jaws have a greater distance between them than should normally be present in a normal jaw relation 146, illustrated in Figure 4B. The discrepancy may be the result of a forward position of the upper jaw, or a rearward position of the lower jaw, or any combination of both.<br>
Use of the pacifier 2 may cause an abnormal relation between the upper jaw and the lower jaw at a time when the canines and/or the first deciduous molars of the child erupt into place. The abnormal jaw relation 142 may be referred to as a Class II jaw relation 142. The canines and/or first deciduous molars may erupt, settle into place and become intercuspated. As a result, the child may have a receded lower jaw relation with the upper jaw. The receded lower jaw relation remains consistent throughout the life of the child and through adulthood unless corrected by orthodontics or surgery.<br>
Use of the pacifier 2 may also cause constriction or a narrowing width 80 of the upper jaw, as shown by occlusion 81 in Figure 14B. Narrowing of the upper jaw may result in a cross-bite 84 of the dentition of the child. A normal bite 83 of molars 85 with a normal arch width 82 is illustrated in Figure 14A.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a pacifier 10 of the present invention. The pacifier 10 may be used by the child, for example, at the age of six months. The pacifier 10 may serve as a replacement for the pacifier 2 illustrated in Figure 1. The pacifier 10 may have a shelf 12 which may have a thickness 14. In an embodiment, the thickness 14 may be equal or thinner than the thickness 5 of the connector 4 of the pacifier 2 illustrated in Figure 1. Preferably, the thickness 14 of the shelf 12 is less than the thickness 5 of the connector 4. Figure 3 ilustrates a side perspective view of the pacifier 10. The shelf 12 may control eruption of the upper deciduous central incisors and the lateral incisors and/or the lower deciduous central incisors and the lateral incisors of the child from an age of, for example, six months to eighteen months.<br>
In an embodiment, an external shield 15 of the pacifier 10 may be identical in shape to the external shield 6 of the pacifier 2. In addition, a nipple or a bulb 16 of the pacifier 10 may be similar in shape, although not necessarily identical in shape, to the nipple or bulb 8 of the pacifier 2. As a result, the pacifier 10 may have a similar feel within the mouth of the child as the pacifier 2.<br>
In an embodiment, the shelf 12 may be connected to the external shield 15 and may extend distally into or to the rear of the mouth of the child. The shelf 12 may or may not cover erupting deciduous lateral incisors 32, 44 and/or central incisors 34, 42, as illustrated in Figure<br>
7. The shelf 12 may prevent the incisors 34, 42, 32, and 44 of child from erupting unequally into the mouth, providing a dentition 53 as illustrated in Figure 5A. The opan bite 52 of Figure 5A may develop as a result of preventing the incisors 34, 42, 32, 44 from fully erupting. When the shelf 12 is part of the improved design, the shelf 12 may allow all eight incisors 34, 42, 32, 44 to erupt equally with a normal relation, as illustrated by a dentition 55 in Figure 5B.<br>
The pacifier 10 may enable full and even eruption of the deciduous central incisors 34, 42 and the lateral incisors 32, 44. Moreover, the pacifier 10 may begin to advance the mandible, or lower jaw, into a more normal Class I jaw relation 146 with the upper jaw. Such a jaw relation 14 6 is generally illustrated in Figure 4B. An abnormal jaw relation 142 is illustrated in Figure 4A. The pacifier 10 may also enable incisors 34, 42, 32, 44 to erupt more normally, without being displaced. For example, the upper incisors 34, 32 may be guided forward and the lower incisors 42, 44 may be guided rearward, as illustrated by the facial profile 141 and abnormal dental relation 140. Moreover, use of the pacifier 10 may provide a normal width 82 with a normal width relation 85 of the molars of the upper jaw, as generally illustrated by occlusion 83 in Figure 14A.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a pacifier 20 which may be used by the child after the child reaches, for example, approximately eighteen months of age. At this time, upper deciduous canines 36 and lower deciduous canines 4 6 and/or first deciduous molars 38, 48 (illustrated in Figure 7) may begin to erupt into the mouth. The pacifier 20 may have an external shield 24 which may be similar in size and/or shape to the external shield 6 of the pacifier 2 and/or the external shield 15 of the pacifier 10.  The pacifier 20 may or may not have a<br>
nipple or bulb 26 which may or may not be similar in shape or size to the bulb 8 of the pacifier 2 and/or the bulb 16 of the pacifier 10. Figure 8 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pacifier 20. A shelf 22 may be shaped to extend distally to the rear of the mouth of the child when the pacifier 20 is worn. The shelf 22 may accommodate and control an extent of the eruption of the upper deciduous canines 36 and the lower deciduous canines 46 and/or the deciduous first molars 38, 48 as illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
The pacifier 20 of Figure 6 may have lower lingual tabs 29 to aid in maintaining the lower jaw, or mandible, in an advanced position while the deciduous canines and first molars erupt. The lingual tabs 29 may form an apex 31. The teeth of the child may then obtain an ideal intercuspation 30 as illustrated in Figure 7. Moreover, the pacifier 20 may assist in maintaining jaw advancement toward the Class I relation 146 and toward a normal tooth relation 144, both illustrated in Figure 4B. The lingual tabs 29 may or may not be present in pacifier 10 of Figure 2. The lingual tabs 29 are illustrated in Figure 8, which is a cross section along the line B-B.<br>
Figure 9A illustrates a pacifier 70 which may be used by the child when the child reaches an age of, for example, approximately 24 to 36 months of age. During this period, upper second deciduous molar 40 and/or lower second deciduous molar 50 (illustrated in Figure 7) may erupt into place. The pacifier 70 may have a shelf 72 which may be shaped to extend distally towards the rear of the mouth of the child when worn. As a result, the pacifier 70 may control the eruption of the upper second deciduous molar 40 and/or the lower second deciduous molar 50.<br>
The pacifier 70 may have a lingual shield 76 which may assist in guiding the posterior molars 38, 40, 48, 50<br>
into a proper occlusion and/or may assist in correcting a posterior cross-bite 81, such as that illustrated in Figure 14B. The posterior cross-bite 81 may be caused by prolonged sucking of the known pacifier 2 of Figure 1 which may draw the upper molars 38, 40 together and narrows the upper arch 80 to produce a molar cross-bite 84. The pacifier 70 may also have a shield 78 (at a buccal location of the pacifier 70 when the pacifier 70 is worn) tc control the eruption and/or position of the upper posterior d3ciduous teeth 38, 4 0 and the lower posterior deciduous teeth 48, 50.<br>
In an embodiment, the pacifier 70 may have lingual tabs 80. In addition, the pacifier 70 may or may not have a nipple or bulb 82 which may be similar in size and/or shape tc the bulb 8 of the pacifier 2, the bulb 16 of the pacifier 10, or the bulb 26 of the pacifier 20. The pacifier 70 may or may not have an exterior shield 84 which may be similar in size and/or shape to the exterior shield 6 of the pacifier 2, the exterior shield 15 of the pacifier 1C, or the exterior shield 24 of the pacifier 20.

The external shield 118 may be attached to the teething arch 120 and also to the retention ring 122, 123 by a hinge 121. The external shield 116, 118, 92, 24, 15, 84 may protect the child from gagging by preventing any pacifier and/or teething arch from slipping back into the throat and/or may help to maintain a position of the pacifier and/or teething arch 110 within the mouth. A first teething arch may be used by the child to relieve pain from teething. During use of the first teething arch, a second, duplicate or similar teething arch may be cooled. The second teething arch may be used by the child after the first teething arch has become warm.<br>
In an embodiment, the shelf 112 may be shaped to extend further into the mouth. The shelf 112 may allow the erupted deciduous central 34, 42 and lateral 32, 44 incisors, as well the deciduous canines 36, 46 and first deciduous molars 38, 48 to be in contact with the shelf 140. Further, the pillows 114 present in appliance 110 may be positioned further distally to cover the gum tissue in the area of the second deciduous molars 40, 50. The pillow 114 of appliance 110 of Figure 11 may be separated from the external shield 116, as illustrated in cross-section taken along line C-C in Figure 12B. As further illustrated in Figure 12B, the pillow 124 may cover the canines 36, 46 and the first molars 38, 48 may be separated from the external shield 126 by a space 138 to allow the lips and/or cheeks of the child to be present without interference.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a pacifier 150 having a pillow 142 which may be positioned further towards the rear of the mouth when the pacifier/teething appliance 150 is worn. As a result, the pillow 142 may allow the pain from the erupting second deciduous molars 40, 50 to be relieved. A shelf 140 may maintain the 'other teeth 34, 42, 32, 44, 36, 46, 38, 48 in their normal position. A flat isthmus 140 may be attached directly to an external shield 152 at the midline or directly to a retention ring 148 directly.<br>
The pacifiers 10, 20, 70, 90, 110, 150 may be used by a child as part of a pacifier system to coincide with development of different tooth groups in the mouth of the child and/or as teething appliances to relieve pain. The child may, for example, wear the pacifier 10 at any age after birth. A teething pad 94 may be incorporated into pacifier 10 to relieve pain and discomfort from the eruption of the incisors 34, 42, 32, 44 (not shown).<br>
Figure 15 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pacifier 90 of Figure 9B. In an embodiment, the pillow 94 may be shaped to receive the incisors 34, 42, 32, 44. In addition, the pillow 94 may be used as a combination pacifier and/or teething appliance and may have a bulb 162. The bulb 162 or any of the bulbs 16, 26, and 82 may be slanted downward to encourage the tongue to be elevated toward the palette to prevent a cross-bite 84 from developing in the patient. A top 164 of the bulb 162 may be flattened for the same effect, namely, preventing a cross-bite 84 from occuring. In an embodiment, the external shield 92 may be connected to the retention ring 93 by a hinge 172.<br>
The child may, for example, wear the pacifier 10 at an age of nine months, when the first deciduous incisors of the child may erupt. The child may then, for example, wear the pacifier 20 at an age of eighteen months, when<br>
the upper deciduous canines and the lower deciduous canines and/or the first deciduous molars may erupt. The child may then, for example, wear the pacifier 70 at an age of twenty-four to thirty-six months, when the upper second deciduous molar and/or the lower second deciduous molar may erupt.<br>
