HIGH VOLTAGE INTERLOCK CONNECTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to vehicular electrical<br>
systems and, more particularly, to a high voltage interlock connection<br>
particularly suited for use onboard a hybrid, electric, or fuel cell vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles generally employ a high<br>
voltage electrical system, which includes at least one high voltage power<br>
source, such as a battery, a fuel cell, a generator, or the like. Before a person<br>
(e.g., a technician) may make physical contact with a current-carrying<br>
component of the electrical system (e.g., the interlock connection terminals),<br>
the high voltage power source should be disconnected and any localized<br>
electrical energy discharged. For this reason, the high voltage electrical<br>
system may employ a high voltage interlock (HVIL) control circuit that<br>
initiates discharge (or disconnection) of the power source when attempted<br>
access to the interlock connection terminals is detected.<br>
[0003] After an HVIL control circuit has initiated discharge of the high<br>
voltage power source, a few seconds may elapse before the high voltage<br>
power source is sufficiently discharged. It thus becomes desirable to equip a<br>
high voltage electrical system with at least one mechanical barrier (referred to<br>
herein as a time-delay feature) that prevents a technician from accessing the<br>
interlock connection terminals until discharge is complete. For example, one<br>
high voltage connection system employs a threaded fastener, which secures an<br>
access cover to a high voltage device. The threaded fastener is covered by a<br>
shroud,  which  is  electrically coupled  to  an HVIL  control  circuit.     To<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
disconnect the threaded fastener and remove the access cover, a technician<br>
first moves the shroud to an open position. This is detected by the HVIL<br>
control circuit, which initiates disconnection and discharge of the high voltage<br>
power source. A few seconds elapse as the technician removes the threaded<br>
fastener thereby permitting the power source time to discharge to an<br>
acceptable level before the access cover is removed.<br>
[0004] Although high voltage connection systems employing conventional<br>
time-delay features are generally effective, they are still limited in certain<br>
respects. For example, high voltage connection systems of the type described<br>
above (i.e., systems employing a threaded fastener to secure an access cover)<br>
do not require reinstallation of the fastener to reconnect the high voltage<br>
interlock connection. As a result, a technician may not reinstall the threaded<br>
fastener after servicing, which may render the time-delay feature ineffective<br>
when the high voltage terminals are again accessed at a later time.<br>
[0005] It should thus be appreciated that it would be desirable to provide a<br>
high voltage connection system employing a time-delay feature that prevents<br>
access to the interlock connection terminals until the high voltage power<br>
source is substantially discharged. It would further be desirable if such a high<br>
voltage connection system required reinstallation of the time-delay feature to<br>
reconnect the interlock connection. Other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] An interlock connection is provided for use in conjunction with a<br>
high voltage electrical system. The interlock connection includes a male<br>
portion, a resilient member, and a female portion adapted to receive the male<br>
portion therein. The female portion includes an access hole through which the<br>
resilient member is accessible when the male portion is received in the female<br>
portion. The resilient member is coupled to the male portion and configured<br>
to engage the female portion to prevent disconnection of the male portion from<br>
the female portion until the resilient member is deformed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AT LEAST ONE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0010] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary, or the following detailed description.<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is an isometric view of a generalized high voltage<br>
connection system 10, which may be deployed on a vehicle (e.g., a hybrid,<br>
electric, or fuel cell vehicle) in accordance with a first exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention. High voltage connection system 10 includes a high<br>
voltage interlock (HVIL) circuit 14 and at least one interlock connection 18.<br>
High voltage connection system 10 electrically couples a high voltage power<br>
source 12 and to at least one high voltage device 16. By way of example, high<br>
voltage power source 12 may take the form of a battery, a fuel cell, a<br>
generator, or the like; and high voltage device 16 may take the form of an<br>
electric motor controller.<br>
[0012] Interlock connection 18 may include a male portion 20, a female<br>
portion 22, and a cover 24; however, it should be understood that interlock<br>
connection 18 may assume any form suitable for connecting high voltage<br>
terminals (e.g., a bulkhead connector). Interlock connection 18 is electrically<br>
coupled between high voltage power source 12 and high voltage device 16. In<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiment, male portion 20 is electrically<br>
connected to high voltage power source 12 by way of wires 26, and female<br>
portion 22 is electrically coupled to high voltage device 16 by way of wires<br>
28. Interlock connection 18 is also electrically coupled to HVIL circuit 14,<br>
which is, in turn, operatively coupled to high voltage power source 12 via<br>
control signal line (e.g., serial data line) 30. For example, a HVIL terminal 32<br>
may be mounted on female portion 22 and electrically coupled to HVIL circuit<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
14 via wire 34. In addition, a shorting plug 36 may be mounted on cover 24<br>
and engage terminal 32 when cover 24 is in the closed position (shown in FIG.<br>
1). HVIL circuit 14 electrically monitors terminal 32 to determine when<br>
shorting plug 36 has been disconnected from terminal 32 and, therefore, when<br>
cover 24 has been moved from the closed position to an open position as<br>
shown in FIG. 2 (described below). This example notwithstanding, HVIL<br>
circuit 14 may be coupled to interlock connection 18 in any manner suitable<br>
for determining when cover 24 is moved to an open position.<br>
[0013] Before servicing high voltage device 16 or another component of<br>
high voltage connection system 10, a technician first disconnects interlock<br>
connection 18. HVIL circuit 14 is configured to detect attempted access to<br>
interlock connection 18 by monitoring the position of cover 24 and to initiate<br>
the discharge (or disconnection) of high voltage power source 12 when cover<br>
24 is moved from the closed position. However, as explained previously,<br>
either the high voltage power source 12 or the high voltage device 16 may<br>
require a few seconds to disconnect or to discharge stored electrical energy.<br>
For this reason, interlock connection 18 is provided with at least one time-<br>
delay feature, which physically impedes the disconnection of interlock<br>
connection 18. In this manner, interlock connection 18 precludes physical<br>
contact with the high voltage terminals contained within interlock connection<br>
18 until high voltage power source 12 is sufficiently removed from the<br>
electrical circuit.<br>
[0014] When disconnecting interlock connection 18, a technician first<br>
moves cover 24 from the closed position to an open position. FIG. 2 is an<br>
isometric view of interlock connection 18 after cover 24 has been moved to an<br>
open position. This results in the disconnection of shorting plug 36 from<br>
HVIL terminal 32. The disconnection is detected by HVIL circuit 14 (FIG. 1),<br>
which commences  disconnection of high voltage power source  12  and<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
discharge of any significant stored electrical energy from the system. To<br>
move cover 24 to the open position, the technician may simply slide cover 24<br>
in the direction indicated by arrow 38. Cover 24 may be retained at an end<br>
portion of female portion 22 or, instead, removed and set aside.<br>
[0015] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of interlock connection 18 taken<br>
along line 2-2 (FIG. 2) and having cover 24 removed for clarity. In this view,<br>
it can be seen that female portion 22 comprises a housing 40 (e.g., plastic)<br>
having a cavity therein and an open end 42. Male portion 20 is inserted into<br>
the cavity of housing 40 through open end 42. At least one access hole is<br>
provided through a wall of housing 40. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, first<br>
and second access holes 44 and 46 may be provided through opposing walls<br>
48 and 50, respectively, of housing 40. Housing 40 also includes at least one<br>
retaining feature therein; e.g., housing 40 may include first and second<br>
retaining features (e.g., projections) 52 and 54, which are disposed on an<br>
interior surface of walls 48 and 50, respectively, proximate open end 42.<br>
Retaining features 52 and 54 are preferably disposed proximate access holes<br>
44 and 46, respectively.<br>
[0016] Male portion 20 of interlock connector 18 comprises a housing 56,<br>
which carries terminals 58. At least one resilient member is coupled to the<br>
exterior of housing 56. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, in particular,<br>
first and second spring clips 60 and 62 are mounted on opposite walls of<br>
housing 56. When male portion 20 is received within female portion 22 as<br>
shown in FIGs. 2 and 3, spring clips 60 and 62 protrude outwardly from<br>
housing 56. If a technician (or other person) attempts to pull male portion 20<br>
from female portion 22, springs clips 60 and 62 abuttingly engage retaining<br>
features 52 and 54, respectively, to prevent disconnection of interlock<br>
connection 18.<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
[0017] FIGs. 4-6 are cross-sectional views of interlock connection 18<br>
illustrating one manner in which connection 18 may be disconnected by a<br>
technician utilizing a disconnection tool 64 (FIGs. 4 and 5). Disconnection<br>
tool 64 is illustrated as an L-shaped body having an elongated handle portion;<br>
however, it should be appreciated that tool 64 may comprise any body suitable<br>
for insertion into access holes 44 and 46. Disconnection tool 64 may be<br>
specialized for use in disconnecting interlock connection 18. Alternatively,<br>
tool 64 may comprise a tool generally suited for other applications, such as a<br>
screw driver, Allen wrench, or the like. For convenience, tool 64 may be<br>
removably secured to cover 24 (FIGs. 1 and 2).<br>
[0018] Disconnection tool 64 includes a head portion adapted to be<br>
inserted into access holes 44 and 46, which provide access to spring clips 60<br>
and 62, respectively, when male portion 20 is received within female portion<br>
22. To this end, access holes 44 and 46 each have a diameter large enough to<br>
permit insertion of tool 64; however, the diameters of access holes 44 and 46<br>
are preferably small enough to prevent a technician (or other person) from<br>
reaching spring clips 60 and 62 with his or her finger. After moving cover 24<br>
to an open position (FIG. 2), the head portion of disconnection tool 64 is<br>
inserted into access hole 44 as indicated in FIG. 4 by arrow 66. Tool 64<br>
engages spring clip 60 and deforms spring clip 60 (e.g., compresses spring clip<br>
60 toward housing 56 of male portion 20). At the same time, male portion 20<br>
may be pulled or twisted away from female portion 22 as indicated by arrow<br>
68. These two movements permit the edge of spring clip 60 to move past<br>
retention feature 52 as shown in FIG. 4 at 70.<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
[0019] Referring now to FIG. 5, tool 64 may next be inserted into access<br>
hole 46 in the manner indicated by arrow 72. This deforms spring clip 62<br>
(e.g., compresses spring clip 62 toward housing 56 of male portion 28) and<br>
thereby permits spring clip 62 to move past retention feature 54 as male<br>
portion 20 is pulled or twisted away from female portion 22 (indicated by<br>
arrow 74). After this step has been completed, spring clips 60 and 62 no<br>
longer abuttingly engage retaining respective features 52 and 54; thus,<br>
interlock connection 18 may now be disconnected by simply pulling male<br>
portion 20 away from female portion 22 as indicated in FIG. 6 by arrows 76.<br>
[0020] It should thus be appreciated that multiple steps must be performed<br>
to disconnect interlock connection 18 after cover 24 (FIGs. 1 and 2) has been<br>
moved to an open position and the discharge of high voltage power source 12<br>
(FIG. 1) has been initiated. As a result, a technician must spend a period of<br>
time (e.g., several seconds) performing the steps described above to<br>
disconnect male portion 20 from female portion 22. This permits high voltage<br>
power source 12 to disconnect and/or discharge before the technician may<br>
come into physical contact with the terminals contained within interlock<br>
connection 18.<br>
[0021] After servicing, interlock connection 18 may be reconnected by<br>
simply plugging male portion 20 into female portion 22. When male portion<br>
20 is first inserted into open end 42 of female portion 22, spring clips 60 and<br>
62 are compressed against housing 56 of male portion 20 by retention features<br>
52 and 54, respectively. When male portion 20 is fully plugged into female<br>
portion 22 such that terminals 58 contact the terminals carried by female<br>
portion 22, spring clips 60 and 62 move past retention features 52 and 54 and,<br>
consequently, expand within female portion 22 to return to the position shown<br>
in FIG. 3. Therefore, in contrast to interlock connections employing<br>
conventional   threaded   fasteners   of the   type   described   above,   interlock<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
connection 18 requires that a technician reinstall or reset the time-delay<br>
feature to reconnect the connection's terminals.<br>
[0022] Although an exemplary embodiment of interlock connection 18 has<br>
been described above as employing spring clips to retain male portion 20<br>
within female portion 22, it should be understood that many other suitable<br>
resilient retentions means may be utilized. For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, housing 56 may be formed from a pliable material that may be<br>
compressed when male portion 20 is inserted into female portion 22.<br>
Alternatively, the resilient retention member may take the form of a spring-<br>
biased device, such as a ball plunger, that may be moved between a retracted<br>
and an extended position. Furthermore, while the interlock connection has<br>
been described above as employing two time-delay features (i.e., resilient<br>
members 60 and 62, retention features 52 and 54, and access holes 44 and 46),<br>
other embodiments of the inventive interlock connection may employ any<br>
number of time-delay features suitable for preventing the disconnection of<br>
interlock connection 18 for a time period sufficient to permit high voltage<br>
power source 12 to be sufficiently discharged.<br>
[0023] In view of the above, it should be appreciated that a high voltage<br>
connection system employing a time-delay feature has been provided that<br>
prevents access to the interlock connection terminals until the high voltage<br>
power source is substantially discharged. It should further be appreciated that<br>
the high voltage connection system requires reinstallation of the time-delay<br>
feature to reconnect the interlock connection. Although exemplary<br>
embodiments of the high voltage connection system have been discussed<br>
above in the vehicular context, it should be appreciated that other<br>
embodiments of the high voltage connection system may be employed in any<br>
context wherein it is desirable to provide electrical access protection.<br>
Furthermore, as used herein the term "high voltage" is intended in its broadest<br><br>
GP-308721-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
sense and includes any voltage at which access protection may be desirable<br>
(e.g., for DC, approximately 30 volts and higher; for AC, approximately 15<br>
volts and higher).<br>
[0024] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in<br>
any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled<br>
in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various<br>
changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims<br>
and the legal equivalents thereof.<br><br>
