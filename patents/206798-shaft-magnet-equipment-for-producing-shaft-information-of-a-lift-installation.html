Description:<br>
Shaft Magnet Equipment for producing Shaft Information of a Lift Installation<br>
The invention relates to a shaft magnet equipment for generating shaft information of a lift installation, wherein at least one shaft magnet arranged in a lift shaft changes the switching state of a magnet switch, which is arranged at a lift cage, during travel of the lift cage in the lift shaft.<br>
Magnets arranged in the lift shaft serve, together with magnet switches arranged at the lift cage, for the generation of shaft information. During travel of the lift cage in the lift shaft the magnet switches the magnet switch, which is usually constructed as a bistable switch, from one switching state into the other switching state, wherein the instantaneous position of the lift cage in the lift shaft is determined for the lift control from the position of the relevant magnets. The magnets arranged, for example, in the region of storeys are usually an'anged at fastening means, for example at rails with grooves, into which groove blocks are laid. The magnets are displaceable along the rails and are firmly screw-connected to the groove blocks of the rails by means of screws.<br>
A disadvantage of the known equipment consists in that expensive fastening means for the magnets is necessary in the region of each storey, which causes substantial cost and mounting time.<br>
Here the invention will create a remedy. The invention, as is characterised in claim 1, meets the object of avoiding the disadvantages of the known equipment and of bringing about a simplifying of the mounting of the shaft magnets.<br>
The advantages achieved by the invention are essentially to be seen in that the means for mounting the magnets are cheap in manufacture and simple in mounting. Further, it is advantageous that the magnets can be mounted without effort at any desired shaft height.<br>
The invention is more closely explained in the following by reference to drawings illustrating an embodiment, in which:<br><br>
Fig. 1   shows a schematic illustration of a guide rail with shaft magnets placed in<br>
position,<br>
Fig. 2  shows a holder. which is placed on the limb of the guide rail, with shaft magnet,<br>
Fig. 3  shows the holder, which is placed on the guide rail, with shaft magnet in side<br>
view,<br>
Fig. 4  shows a plan view of the holder. Fig. 5 shows a side view of the holder and<br>
Fig. 6  shows a three-dimensional illustration of the holder.<br>
i<br>
A shaft component in the form of a guide rail for guidance of a lift cage in a lift shaft is denoted by 1 in Figs. 1 to 6. The guide rail 1 has a guide limb 1.1 and two holding limbs 1.2. Arranged at one holding limb 1.2 are shaft magnets 2, which change the switching stage of magnet switches arranged at the lift cage. On the basis of the switching states of the magnet switches, the lift control recognises the position of the lift cage in the lift shaft and can, for example, con'espondingly control the drive. The lowermost shaft magnet 2 shown in Fig. 1 during upward travel of the lift cage triggers, for example, the switching over of travel speed to crawling speed. Then the lift cage travels further at crawling speed up to the next storey magnet 2, which, for example, causes switching-off of the drive. The lift cage now stands at a storey 3. In rational manner, the same switching sequence results with the two upper shaft magnets 2 during downward travel of the lift cage. <br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show the guide rail 1 arranged, for example, at a shaft wall 4, wherein the guide rail 1 is arranged at a spacing a from the shaft wall 4 due to fastening means, which are not illustrated. The spacing a allows pushing of a holder 5 with clip characteristics onto the holding limb 1.2 of the guide rail 1. The holder 5 can receive the shaft magnet 2 placeable on the guide rail 1.<br><br>
Figs. 4 to 6 show details of the holder 5, which serves as holder and caliper for positioning the shaft magnets 2. The holder 5 is approximately U-shaped. Another shaping is also possible. The one-piece holder 5 consist of a foot part 5.1, a back part 5.2 and a front part 5.3, at which a recess 5.4, for example a bore, for reception of the shaft magnet 2 is arranged. The shape of the recess 5.4 conforms with the shaft magnet 2 to be received. A shaft magnet 2 which is, for example, rectangular requires a rectangular recess 5.4. The foot part 5.1 of the holder 5 has a respective reinforcing rib 5.5 at each side and a first chamfer 5.6 at the free end. The front part 5.3 with the recess 5.4 has a second, chamfer 5.7. The chamfers 5.6 and 5.7 facilitate the pushing of the holder 5 onto the holding limb 1.2 of the guide rail 1. The foot part 5.1 and front part 5.3 in the rest state run slightly towards one another towards their free ends. On pushing of the holder 5 onto the holding limb 1.1 the parts 5.1 and 5.3 are lightly spread, whereby the holder 5 is firmly clipped to the holding limb 1.2 by means of the parts 5.1 and 5.3 due to the spring properties of the back part 5.2. The shaft magnet 2 can now be placed on the holding limb 1.2 through the recess 5.4. The shaft magnet 2 is firmly retained by its magnetic force at the holding limb 1.2 of the guide rail 1. The holder 5 and the shaft magnet 2 are firmly connected with the guide rail directly and without outside fastening means and can individually be easily released from the guide rail 1 and be arranged again wherever desired along the guide rail height. The holder 5 or the shaft magnet 2 can also be arranged at the guide rail 1 or at other components of the lift shaft by outside fastening means. <br>
In a further variant of embodiment, the shaft magnets 2 are arranged directly at the guide rail 1 without a holder 5.<br>
The holder 5 and/or shaft magnet 2 can be arranged at the guide rail 1 and/or at other<br>
I components of the lift shaft.<br>
The shaft magnet 2 can, without further measures, be removed against its magnetic force from the guide rail 1 and the holder 5 can be withdrawn from the holding limb 1.2 against the friction forces produced on the guide rail 1 by the foot part 5.1 and front part 5.3.<br><br><br><br>
