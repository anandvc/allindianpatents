				<td>REDUCTION OP THE CONTENT OF PROTEIN CONTAMINANTS IN COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A VITAMIN K-DEPENDENT PROTEIN OF INTEREST<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Vitamin K-dependent protein compositions having a very low, or negligible, content of protein contaminants. The present invention also relates to method applicable in the preparation of such Vitamin K-dependent protein compositions. Such methods may either be used alone or in sequential combination with the purpose of reducing the relative content of protein contaminants. The present invention is particularly relevant in the preparation of compositions of coagulation factors selected from Factor X polypeptides (FK/FXa), Factor IX polypeptldes (FIX/FIXa), Factor VII polypeptides (FVII/FVIIa), and the anticoagulant Protein C, in particular Factor VII polypeptides.<br>
BACKGROUND 0F THE INVENTION<br>
In the production of recomblnant proteins from cultures of microorganisms or cell lines, the final production? step is the recovery and optionally the concentration of the product of interest. Culture media in which the cells have been grown and which contain secreted proteins, and, in particular, cell lysates containing intracellular proteins of Interest also contain, to a greater or lesser extent, other proteins produced by the cells, apart from other contaminants, sjuch as media components, nucleic acids and the like. In order to obtain a purified protein product, it is therefore necessary to separate the protein of interest from other proteins ajnd polypeptides and other impurities in the crude material containing the protein of interest.<br>
It is often difficult to remove protein contaminant comprising domains of the same nature as the polypeptideiof interest.<br>
Vitamin K-dependent proteins are distinguished from other proteins by sharing a common structural featute In their amlno terminal part of the molecule. The N-terminal of these proteins, also referred to as the Gla-domain, Is rich In the unusual amlno acid Y-carboxy glutarnic acid which is synthesized from glutamate in a Vitamin K-dependent reaction catalysed by th« enzyme y-glutamyl carboxylase. Because of the presence of about 2 to 12 Gla residues, the Gla-domain is characterised by being capable of binding divalent cations such as Ca2+. Upon binding of metal ions, these proteins undergo conformational changes which can be measured by several techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence emission.<br><br>
The discovery of metal induced conformational changes of Gla- containing proteins (Nelsestuen et.al., J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251, 6886-6893) together with identification of conformation specific polyclonal antibodies (Furie et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253, 8980-8987) opened the way for the introduction of conformation specific immunoaffinity chromatography. These antibodies could recognise and bind the Gla-domain in the presence of Ca2+ ions but released the protein upon removal of Ca2+ ions using a Ca2+ chelator such as EDTA or citrate,<br>
In the 1980's conformation specific pseudoaffinity chromatography was developed making use of the unique property of Gla containing proteins to undergo metal induced changes in conformation. Pseudoaffinity chromatography differs from the conventional affinity chromatography in that there is no immobilized affinity ligand involved and it is performed on a conventional chromatographic matrix (Van S. B., J. Mol. Recog. 1996; 9, 211-218). The Gla protein can be adsorbed to an anion exchange material by eliminating divalent metal ions. Subsequently, elution is performed by adding Ca2+ to the elution buffer.<br>
In 1986, Bj0rn land Thim reported purification of recombinant Factor VII on an anion exchange material taking advantage of Ca2+-binding property of Gla-domaln of Factor VII (Bj0rn S. and Thim L, Research Dislosure, 1986, 26960-26962.). Adsorption was achieved in a buffer without Ca2+and elution of Factor VII was possible using a Ca2+ containing buffer with low ionic strength and under mild conditions.<br>
Van et al. have used the same principle for the purification of recombinant human Protein C (Van S. B. et all, Bio/technology. 1990; 8, 655-661).<br>
While the presence of Gla-domaln provides an advantage for separation of Gla containing proteins from other proteins, the inventors of present invention observed that similar properties and behaviour of the Gla containing proteins makes it difficult to separate them from each other. Several conformational specific antibodies raised against one Gla proteins show cross reactivity with other Gla proteiris (Furie B. and Furie B., J. Biol. Chem, 1979; 254, 9766-9771; Church et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263, 6259-6267.).<br>
Brown et al. (Brown et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275, 19795-19802.) have reported monoclonal antibodies specific for Gla residues. These antibodies could recognize all of the Gla proteins te$ted: Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor II, Protein C, Protein S, GAS-6, bone matrix Gia protein, conantokin G.<br>
Proteins with a GLA-domain comprises, but is not limited to, the following proteins: GAS-6, Protein S, Factor II (Prothrombin), thrombln, Factor X/Xa, Factor IX/IXa, Protein C, Factor VH/VIIa, Protein Z, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamlc acid protein 1, Transmembrane<br><br>
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 2, Transmembrane gamma carboxyglutamic acid protein 3, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4, Matrix Gla protein, and Osteocalcin.<br>
US 5,633,350 describes a method for the separation of Vitamin K dependent proteins from non-Vitamin K dependent accompanying proteins.<br>
The need for efficiently separating a Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest, such as a Gla-domaln containing polypeptide of interest, from protein contaminants is a particularly relevant issue when dealing with the purification of such polypeptides produced in cell cultures, because the host cell (which may not be a human cell line) may produce significant amounts of protein contaminants that can cause undesirable immunogenic reactions upon use of the polypeptide.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide suitable methods for the reduction or even removal of the content of protein contaminants in compositions comprising a Vitamin K-dependent protein of Interest. A further object of the present invention is to provide compositions comprising a Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest with a very low or even negligible content of protein contaminants.<br>

The expression "polypeptides" in connection with the terms "Factor X polypeptides" and "Factor IX polypeptides" is intended to encompass any protein comprising the arnino acid sequence of the wild-type human Factor X and Factor IX, respectively, as well as the respective "analogues", "variants", "related polypeptides", "derivatives" and "conjugates" thereof, where the expressions "variants", "related polypeptides", "derivatives" and "conjugates" are defined as for Factor VII, mutatis mutandis.<br>
Compositions<br>
When used herein, the expression "composition" is intended to mean a liquid composition, such as an aqueous liquid composition, i.e. a composition comprising less than 5% of non-aqueous solvents.<br>
The term "first composition" refers to a composition comprising a Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest prior to a treatment, such as a purification step, according to the present invention. The term is used to distinguish the "first composition" from "a second composition", which refers to the same composition, but after such treatment, such as a purification step.<br>
The Vitamin K-dependent protein of Interest Is most typically a recombinant protein produced under cell culture conditions, i.e. the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest is either obtained directly as a constituent of a cell culture supernatant, or obtained from a cell culture supernatant after one or more preceding process steps. In practising the present invention, the cells are eukaryote cells, such as an established eukaryote cell line, including, without limitation, CHO (e.g., ATCC CCL 61), COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK), and HEK293 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1573; Graham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977) cell lines. A preferred BHK cell line is the tk ts!3 BHK cell line (Waechter and Baserga, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sd.USA 79:1106-1110, 1982), hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk' ts!3 BHK cell line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632. A preferred CHO cell line is the CHO Kl cell line available from ATCC under accession number CCI61.<br>
Other suitable cell lines include, without limitation, Rat Hep I (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1600), Rat Hep II (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1548), TCMK (ATCC CCL 139), Human lung<br><br>
10<br>
(ATCC HB 8065), NCTC 1469 (ATCC CCL 9.1); DUKX cells (CHO cell line) (Uriaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, 1980) (DUKX cells also being referred to as DXB11 cells), and DG44 (CHO cell line) (Cell, 33: 405, 1983, and Somatic Cell and Molecular Genetics 12: 5§5, 1986). Also useful are 3T3 cells, Namalwa cells, myelomas and fusions of myelomas with other cells. In some embodiments, the cells may be mutant or recombinant cells, such as, «.g., cells that express a qualitatively or quantitatively different spectrum of enzymes that catalyze post-translational modification of proteins (e.g., glycosylation enzymes such as glycosyl transferases and/or glycosidases, or processing enzymes such as propeptides) than the cell type from which they were derived. Suitable insect cell lines also include, without limitation, Lepldoptera cell lines, such as Spodoptera frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia ni cells (see, e.g., US 5,077,214).<br>
Typically, the total content of protein contaminants in the first (such as an unpurified) composition is et least 200 ppm, such as at least 300 ppm, e.g. at least 400 ppm, or at least 500 ppm.<br>
Also typically, tjie total content of Protein S contaminants in the first (such as an unpurified) composition is at least 200 ppm, such as at least 300 ppm, e.g. at least 400 ppm, or at least 500 ppm.<br>
Typical protein contaminants<br>
When used herein, the terms "protein contaminant" and "protein contaminants" and the like are Intended to refer to protein or polypeptide constituents constituting Impurities in relation to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest. Thus, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest will obviously not be counted as a protein contaminant although the definitions of "Vitamin K-dependent protein" as such and "protein contaminants", respectively, are partly overlapping. In one embodiment the protein contaminant Is a Vitamin K-dependent protein (but not the Vitsamin K-dependent protein of Interest).<br>
As the Vitamin K-dependent proteins are typically produced in cell cultures, a particular groups of protein contaminants is host cell proteins. "Host cell proteins" are proteins produced by the host cell expressing the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest, and are typically considered as impurities. Host cell proteins can be human proteins if a human cell line is used for production of Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest or non-human proteins, If a non-human cell line is used for production of the protein of interest. Thus, in one aspect of the invention, the protein contaminant is a host cell protein, such as a Vitamin K-dependent protein.<br><br>
11<br>
A particularly relevant class of host cell proteins are Gla-domain containing proteins such as GAS-6, Protein S, Factor II (Prothrornbin), thrombin, Factor X/Xa, Factor IX/IXa, Protein C, Factor VH/VIIa, Protein Z, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 1, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 2, Transmembrane gamma carboxyglutamto acid protein 3, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4, Matrix Gla protein, and Osteocalcin. The number of Gla residue in these proteins is in the range of 2-12. Since the synthesis of Gla residues requires Vitamin K, proteins containing Gla residues are also referred to as Vitamin K-dependent proteins.<br>

In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for separation of non-human protein contaminants from human Vitamin K-dependent protein. In one aspect of the invention, the ition-hurnan protein contaminants are also Vitamin K-dependent proteins. In yet another aspect, the non-human protein contaminants are hamster proteins.<br>
This being said, the method of the Invention renders it possible to yield a level of protein contaminants) expressed as parts per million relative to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest which has been reduced by at least a factor of 10, or at least a factor of 25, or at least a factor of 50, such as by at least a factor of 100, or at least a factor of 250, or at least a factor of 500, or at least a factor of 750, or at least a factor of 1000, or at least a factor of 2000.<br>
In particular, the total content of protein contaminants in the resulting second (such as a purified) composition, such as a treated cell culture supernatant, is at the most 100 ppm, such as at the most 90 ppm, or at the most 80 ppm, or at the most 70 ppm, or at the most 60 ppm, or at the most 50 ppm, or at the most 40 ppm, or at the most 30 ppm, or at the most 20 ppm, or at the most 10 ppm or at the most 5 ppm; or the total content of Protein S contaminants in the resulting second (such as a purified) composition, such as a treated cell culture supernatant, is at the most 100 ppm, such as at the most 90 ppm, or at the most 80 ppm, or at the most 70 ppm, or at the most 60 ppm, or at the most 50 ppm, or at the most 40 ppm, or at tie most 30 ppm, or at the most 20 ppm, or at the most 10 ppm or at the most 5 ppm or at the most 1 ppm.<br><br>
Typical cell culture supernatants may have a significant amount of protein contaminants (in particular Protein S), thus, the total content of protein contaminants in the (such as an unpurified) cell culture supernatant is typically at least 500 ppm, such as at least 750 ppm, or at least 100® ppm, or at least 2000 ppm; or the total content of Protein S contaminants in the (such as an unpurified) cell culture supernatant is at least 500 ppm, such as at least 750 ppm, or at least 1000 ppm, or at least 2000 ppm.<br>

Solid phase materials useful herein are those typically used in chromatographic and affinity capture methods and processes and particular variants hereof, as will be evident.<br>
In one main variant of the above, the solid phase material binds a relatively higher amount of the protein contaminant compared to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest. In one aspect, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest does not bind to the solid phase and flows through the chromatographic column while the protein contaminant binds to the solid phase, resulting in the separation of the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest from the protein contaminant. In particular, the solid phase material specifically binds at least one of the contaminants, e.g. by strong affinity or by covalent binding of said contaminant(s), such as by formation of dlsulphide bonds to thiol moieties of said contamlnant(s).<br>
In one embodiment, the solid phase material is an ion exchange resin, such as anion exchange resin, Commonly used anlon exchange resins comprises Q-resin, a Quaternary amine, and DEAE resin, DIEthylAminoEthane. Anion exchange resins are commercially available, e.g. Mono Q (Arnersham Biosciences), Source 15Q or 30Q (Amersham Biosclences), Poros 20HQ or 50HQ (Perceptive Biosystems), Toyppearl Q650S (Toso Haas) and others.<br>
The elution from the anion exchange resin can be performed by increasing the conductivity of the elution buffer such as increasing the concentration of the salts in the elution buffer, or by decreasing the pH of the elution buffer. In one particular embodiment of the invention the elution is performed by increasing the concentration of CaCI2. In another particular embodiment the elution is performed by increasing the concentration of MgCI2. The elution can be carried out stepwise or by using a gradient elution.<br><br>
The most widely used cation exchange resin contains a carboxymethyl (CM) or sulfopropyl (SP) group. Examples of such cation exchangers include without limitationToyopearl CM-650 or Toyopearl SP-650 (Toso Haas), Source 15 S or 30 S, CM or SP Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) Obelix (Amersham Biosciences).<br>
In another embodiment, the solid phase material is a matrix substituted with hydrophobic ligands such as ethyl-, butyl-, phenyl or hexyl- groups. This type of chrornatography is referred to as hydrophobic interaction chrornatography (HIC) and takes advantage of the hydrophobic properties of the proteins. The adsorption is promoted by the hydrophobic interactions between non-polar regions on the protein and immobilised hydrophobic ligands on a solid support. Adsorption is achieved at high salt concentrations in the aqueous mobile phase and elutipn is facilitated by decreasing the salt concentration. In one particular embodiment, material is a matrix substituted with a butyl or a phenyl ligand.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the solid phase material carries affinity ligands. In one embodiment, the solid phase material is carrying monoclonal antibodies raised against at least one of the protein contarninant(s), in particular against Protein S. This is illustrated in the "Experimerttals" section. In another aspect, the solid phase material is carrying immobilized triazine ligands, such as a triazane ligand as described in WO 97/10887 (such as a triazane ligand as described on page 5 lines 21 to page 13 line 6) or in US 6,117,996 (such as paragraph 4*21) the content of which is hereby Incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Protein S circulates in plasma either free or in complex with C4bp. The B chain contains the interaction site for protein S. It is thus important for the present invention to use C4bp species containing the B chain. In one embodiment of the invention th entire C4bp molecule is used for immobilisation to the solid matrix. In another embodiment the B-chain or a sequence of B chain which is capable of binding protein S is used for immobilisation to the solid matrix.<br>
In another variant, the solid phase material is carrying immobilised Protein C . In another variant, the solid phase material Is carrying an Immobilised triazin ligand. In another variant, the solid phase material is carrying C4 binding protein. Protein S binds to Protein C and C4bp with much greater affinity than other Vitamin K-dependent proteins. It is therefore possible to reduce the content of Protein S by binding Protein S to immobilized Protein C or C4bp. Alternatively, selected sequences of Protein C and C4bp responsible for binding to Protein S can be used for immobilization to the solid phase.<br>
The C4b-binding protein (C4bp) is involved in the regulation of the complement system. It is a multimeric protein comprising 7 identical alpha chains and a single beta chain. The alpha and beta chains have molecular weights 70 kD and 45 kD, respectively. Both subunits belong<br><br>
to a superfamily of proteins composed predominantly of tandemly arranged short consensus repeats (SCR) approximately 60 arnino acid residues in length.<br>
In another embodiment, the solid phase mater'al binds at least one of the contaminant(s) by covalent capture. Protein S has one free cysteine moiety, whereas Factor VII has none. The free cysteine moiety can then be attached selectively to an activated thiolated substance or a matrix by thiol-disulphide exchange, with the formation of a mixed disulphide. Hereby it should be possible to reduce Protein S by for example covalent chromatography, size exclusion chromatography or membrane processes. It should be understood that a variant of this embodiment is the one where a solid phase material is not involved, i.e. where disulphide formation (e.g. by the formation of dimers) renders it possible to separate the protein contaminant from the Vitamin K-dependent protein of Interest by other means, e.g. by size exclusion chromatography or membrane processes.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest is a constituent of a cell culture supernatant, cf. the "Experlmentals" section.<br>
In another embodiment of the method defined further above, the solid phase material binds a relatively higher amount of the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest compared to the protein contamlnant(s). More particularly, the solid phase material specifically binds the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest.<br>
In one variant, the solid phase material is carrying monoclonal antibodies raised against the Vitamin K-dependent protein of Interest or an analogue thereof.<br>
In another variant, the solid phase material is carrying an inhibitor for said Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest, e.g. a benzamidine- or a guanidine-type inhibitor such as those comprising a -C(=N-Z'-R'J-NH-Z^R2 motif, wherein<br>
Z1 and Z2 independently are selected from the group consisting of -O-, -S-, -NRH- and a single bond, where RH Is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-4-alkyl, aryl and arylmethyl, and R1 and R2 independently are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen,, optionally substituted C1-6-alkyl, optionally substituted C2-6-alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, or<br>
Z2 and R2 are as defined above and -C=N-Z1-R1 forms part of a heterocyclic ring, or Z1 and R1 are as defined above and -C-NH-Z2-R2 forms part of a heterocyclic ring, or<br><br>
-C( = N-Z1-R1)-NH-Z2-R2 forms a hetercyclic ring wherein -Z1-R'-RZ2- is a biradical.<br>
In still other variants, the solid phase material is carrying a metal which is capable of chelating with said Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest (where subsequent elution can be performed by pH change or with a buffer like irnidazole), or is carrying immobilized tissue factor (thromboplastin) (in this instance it is found that Factor VII polypeptides binds to tissue factor with much greater affinity than protein contaminants like Protein S, for what reason it will b« possible to reduce the content of, e.g., Protein S by binding, e.g., a Factor VII polypeptide to immobilized tissue factor (see also US 6,573,056)), or is carrying immobilized heparin (see the "Experimentals" section), or is carrying phosphatidylserine (phosphatidylserine binds to the Gla-domain of Gla-domain comprising proteins like Vitamin K-dependent proteins only in the absence of calcium; in the presence of calcium, phosphatidylserine bind to the EGF-domain (Factor VII has 2 EGF-loops and Protein S has 4 EGF-loops), thus, it will be possible to separate Factor VII and protein contaminants like Protein S due tp different affinity for phosphatidylserine, especially in the presence of calcium).<br>
In another embodiment, the solid phase material is hydroxyapatite<br>
In another embodiment of the method defined further above, the solid phase material is a chromatograpHic material. Examples of suitable solid phase materials are, e.g., those selected from anion exchange materials, cation exchange materials, hydroxyapatite, hydrophobic soiid phase materials, etc., cf. the "Experimentals" section.<br>
Various particular aspects of the invention will be described in the following.<br>
Imrnunoaffinlt&gt;j using monoclonal antibody for protein contaminant<br>
According to this aspect of the present invention, at least one of the protein contaminant(s) is bound by a solid phase material carrying monoclonal antibodies. Thus, the composition may simply be contacted with said solid phase material and subsequently separated from the solid phase material so as to obtain an at least less contaminated composition.<br>
Coupling of monoclonal antibodies to a solid phase material can be performed via reactive groups placed on the solid phase material. The most typical used matrices are cyanogen bromide (CNBr) or N-hydroxy-succinlmide (NHS) activated supports (Wilchek M. et al., Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers. 1999, 41,263-268). Regarding the CNBr- and NHS activated supports the coupling occurs via primary amino-groups in the antibody leading to an Isourea-bond with the CNBr-group and an amide-bond with the NHS-group.<br><br>
The antibody solution is dissolved or dialysed into a suitable coupling buffer, for instance 0.2 M NaHC03, 0.5 M NaCI pH 8.3, buffers with primary amino-groups can not be used. The coupling pH defends on the antibody and the activated support but normally pH 6-9 can be used. In order to preserve the stability of the activated support before use it Is washed with 10-15 media volumes of ice cold 1 mM HCI. Immediately after the washed support is transferred to the antibody solution and gently mixed and adjusted to the desired pH level. The coupling mixture is left with gentle rotation either a few hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 ^C. After the coupling is completed, any non-reacted groups on the support are blocked by standing for instance in a Tris, ethanol amine or glycine buffer pH 8-9 for a few hours at room Hemperature. After blocking the support is washed using a method which alternates high and low pH with for instance the blocking buffer and an acetate buffer pH 3-4.<br>
One particular embodiment relates to a method for reducing the content of one or more protein contaminants in a first composition (such as a cell culture supernatant) comprising a Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest, said method comprising the step of (i) contacting a first (such as aiti unpurified) composition with a solid phase material carrying monoclonal antibodies raised against at least one of the protein contamlnant(s), and (ii) separating the thus resulting second composition from said solid phase material so as to obtain a composition wHereln the level of protein contaminant(s) expressed as parts per million relative to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest has been reduced by at least a factor of 5.<br>
Thus, It Is foun$ to be very beneficial to use a celfculture supernatant directly, i.e. without any preceding purification steps. This may be due to the fact that the protein contaminant(s) may be at least partly cleaved by the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest if the cell culture supernatant is processed prior to application of the present method whereby a more complex mixture of protein contaminants arises. It may, thus, be even more difficult to reduce the consent of protein contaminants when such a complex mixture exists.<br>
This being said, It should be understood that the present invention also provides an alternative method wherein the same steps are applied, but where the liquid composition comprising the Vitamin K-dependent protein of Interest is not necessarily a constituent of a cell culture supernatant obtained directly from a cell culture.<br>
The protein contaminant(s) is/are typically host cell proteins, and, thus, the monoclonal antibody is typically raised against a protein contaminant selected from host cell proteins, such as Gla-doitnain-containing protein contaminants, in particular a protein contaminant selected from GAS-6, Protein S, Factor II (Prothrombin), Factor X/Xa, Factor IX/IXa, Protein C, Factor Vila, Protein Z, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 1, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 2, Transmembrane gamma<br><br>
carboxyglutamic acid protein 3, Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4, Matrix Gla protein, and Osteocalcin, more particularly Protein S.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest is typically a Vitamin K-dependent cqagulation factor selected from F:actor VII polypeptides, Factor IX polypeptides, Factor X polypeptides and activated Protein C. In one more particular embodiment, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest Is a Factor IX polypeptide. In another more particular embodiment, the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest is a Factor VII polypeptide.<br>
In one embodiment, a predominant amount of protein contaminants are Gla-domain containing polypeptides, in particular Protein S, and the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest is a Factor VII polypeptide.<br>
This being said, the method renders It possible to yield a level of protein contaminant(s) expressed as parts per million relative to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest which has been reduced by at least a factor of 10, or at least a factor of 25, or at least a factor of 50, such as by at least a factor of 100, or at least a factor of 250, or at least a factor of 500, or at least a factor of 750, or at least a factor of 1000, or at least a factor of 2000.<br>
In particular, the total content of protein contaminants in the second (purified) composition is at the most 100 ppm, such as at the most 90 ppm, or at the most 80 ppm, or at the most 70 ppm, or at the most 60 ppm, or at the most 50 ppm, or at the most 40 ppm, or at the most 30 ppm, or at the most 20 ppm, or at the most 10 ppm or at the most 5 ppm; or the total content of Protein S contaminants in the second (purified) composition is at the most 100 ppm, such as at the most 90 ppm, or at the most 80 ppm, or at the most 70 ppm, or at the most 60 ppm, or at the most 50 ppm, or at the most 40 ppm, or at the most 30 ppm, or at the most 20 ppm, or at the most 10 ppm or at the most 5 ppm.<br>
Typical cell culture supernatants may have a significant amount of protein contaminants (in particular Protein S), thus, the total content of protein contaminants in a cell culture supernatant (such as an uhpurlfied cell culture supernatant) is typically at least 500 ppm, such as at least 750 ppm, or at least 1000 ppm, or at least 2000 ppm; or the total content of Protein S contaminants in the unpurified cell culture supernatant Is at least 500 ppm, such as. at least 750 ppm, or at least 1000 ppm, or at least 2000 ppm.<br>
A particular embodiment of this aspect of the present invention relates to a method for reducing the content of Protein S contaminants In a cell culture supernatant comprising a Factor VII polypeptide, said method comprising the step of (I) contacting a first composition, such as a cell culture supernatant with a solid phase material carrying monoclonal antibodies raised against the Protein S contaminant(s), and (il) separating the thus resulting second<br><br>
composition from said solid phase material so as to obtain a composition wherein the level of Protein S contaminant(s) expressed as parts per million relative to the Factor VII polypeptide of interest has feeen reduced by at least a factor of 50.<br>
Immobilised Protein C<br>
According to this aspect of the present invention, at least one of the protein contaminant(s) is bound by a solid phase material carrying immobilised Protein C. Thus, the composition may simply be contacted with said solid phase material and subsequently separated from the solid phase material so as to obtain an at least less contaminated composition.<br>
More particularly, the invention provides a method for reducing the content of protein contaminants in a composition comprising a Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest, said method comprising the step of (i) contacting a first composition with a solid phase material carrying immobilised Protein C, and (ii) separating the thus resulting second composition from said solid phase material so as to obtain a composition wherein the level of protein contamlnant(s);expressed as parts per million relative to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of. interest has been reduced by at least a factor of 5, such as a method for reducing the content of Protein S in a composition comprising a Factor VII polypeptide, said method comprising the step of (i) contacting a first composition with a solid phase material carrying immobilised Protein C, and (ii) separating the thus resulting second composition from said solid phase material so as to obtain a composition wherein the level of protein contaminant(s) expressed as parts per millon relative to the Vitamin K-dependent protein of interest has been reduced by at least a factor of 10.<br>
It should be understood that the above methods for the reduction of the content of protein contaminant(s) may be used alone or in combination, such as in combination. The individual chromatography steps may be carried out in any suitable order. Based on preliminary studies, it is believed that the following combinations provide an excellent overall reduction of the content of protein contaminant(s):<br>

Monoclonal antilhamstei" Protein S antibodies<br>
These antibodie$ have been developed using RBF mice immunised with a hamster Protein S pool isolated from SF-Factor Vila production, and by using a fusion technique involving FoxNy myelomas as fusion partner to the RBF splenocytes. The said monoclonal antibodies recognize any epitope outside the thrombin cleavage site as well as outside the C4BP binding area. Furthermore the said monoclonal antibodies can be Ca2+ independent as well as Ca2+ dependent. Theisald monoclonal antibody can be of any Ig class.<br>
The Ca2+ Independent monoclonal anti hamster protein S antibodies are intended to be used for the detection of hamster Protein S contamination in any drug produced from CHO cells. Furthermore, It is the Intention to use the Ca2+ dependent monodonal anti hamster Proteins antibodies for isolation and purification of hamster Protein S from the production of drugs produced by CHO cells, and In particular to reduce (such as eliminate) the content Protein S in Vitamin K-dependent protein compositions.<br>
RBF mice were Immunised with hamster Protein S isolated from the SF-Factor VIIa production (batch HW3-029 pool, contains 
either of the IgGl or the IgG2a isotype. A Sandwich ELJSA assay was developed using two (ProS-1 F18 and ProS-2 F32) of the four Ca2+ independent antibodies for determination of hamster Protein S contamination In Ca2+ dependency as these two antibodies showed good cooperation. The relative affinity of the four Ca2+ independent monoclonal antibodies was quite low. Furthermore, we have shown that there is not cross-reactivity to Factor Vila. One monoclonal, ProS-1 F22, was used in an ELISA for human Protein S detection. F22 did not recognize human Protein S at all. Most likely this is the case for the monoclonals as well. Furthermore we have developed three Ca2+ dependent antibodies, ProS-2 F15, ProS-2 F35 and ProS-2 F44 neither of which binds to any Protein S in the presence of 20 mM Citrate, i.e. when there is no Ca2+ present. The binding capacity of the three antibodies to Protein S varies with the concentration of Ca2+ (ranging form 2.5 mM to 35 mM Ca2+), but are all significantly different from when there is no Ca2+ present. The three antibodies has been frozen until further notice.<br>
