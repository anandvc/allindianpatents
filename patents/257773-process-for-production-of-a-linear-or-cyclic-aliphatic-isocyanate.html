PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF ISOCYANATE, ISOCYANATE PRODUCED BY THE PROCESS, AND USE OF THE ISOCYANATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate comprising a step of reacting a linear or cyclic aliphatic amine with hydrogen chloride (step for obtaining hydrochloride).  The present invention further relates to a linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate obtained by the production process and the use of the isocyanate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
An isocyanate compound is useful as a raw material for the production of a polyurethane material, a polyurea material, a polyisocyanurate material and the like used in the fields of chemical, resin and paint industries.<br>
[0003]<br>
In particular, since a plastic lens using a polyurethane material containing a sulfur atom or the like is lightweight and hardly broken as compared to an inorganic lens, and can be dyed, in late years, it has quickly come into wide use as an optical element of a spectacle lens, a camera lens and the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
In processes for preparing important isocyanates in the various applications including a raw material of resin for the aforementioned plastic lens, further rationalization of such processes has been in demand. So, various proposals have already been made.<br>
[0005]<br>
As the process for preparing isocyanates, a phosgene process comprising reacting a raw material amine with phosgene can be cited as a typical example. As the phosgene process, a direct process comprising directly reacting a raw material amine with phosgene, and a hydrochloride process comprising converting a raw material amine into hydrochloride and then reacting with phosgene have been widely known.<br>
[0006]<br>
The direct process is much simpler as compared to the hydrochloride process, but urea has been generated as a by-product by reacting carbamoyl chloride or isocyanate that is an intermediate with a raw material amine in many cases.  In case of the preparation of an aromatic isocyanate, since urea generated as a by-product is further reacted with phosgene to generate an isocyanate, products is obtained in relatively high yield and generation of urea is not usually a problem accordingly. However, when a linear or cyclic aliphatic amine is reacted with phosgene in the direct process, since the byproduced urea is reacted with phosgene, there has been known that a chlorine derivative is generated as a by-product (for example, refer to Patent Document 1) .  The chlorine derivative is usually byproduced in an amount<br>
of 3 to 10% and is sometimes byproduced as high as 20%. Hence the yield of the desired product might be decreased and the physical properties of the resin such as urethane or the like in use might be also adversely affected. So, the direct process is not usually adopted. Namely, in case of the preparation of a linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate, in order to suppress generation of urea as a by-product, the hydrochloride process comprising converting a raw material amine into hydrochloride and then reacting with phosgene to prepare an isocyanate has been employed (for example, refer to Patent Documents 2 to 5). [0007]<br>
Of these Patent Documents, in Patent Document 3 to 5, there have been described processes comprising preparing an isocyanate by converting a raw material amine into hydrochloride in an organic solvent or the like in advance and then reacting with phosgene.<br>
Patent Document 1: GB Patent No. 1086782<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Laid-open No, 1975-108239<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1999-310567<br>
Patent Document 4: GB Patent No. 1146664<br>
Patent Document 5: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-286241<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
However, in the hydrochloride process, the increased viscosity of the obtained hydrochloride slurry is accompanied by disadvantages of a decrease of the productivity and the like. So, it has been demanded to be solved.  For example, in the<br>
hydrochloride process, generally used is a process which comprises blowing hydrogen chloride gas into an organic solvent with a raw material amine dissolved therein for the production of hydrochloride. At this time, the concentration of the raw material amine is, for example, not less than 5 weight %, which is industrially favorable.  When the raw material amine is reacted with hydrogen chloride gas under a condition such a concentration, as the reaction is progressed, the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry is increased, for example, to 5,000 to 10,000 mPa-s, the fluidity of the hydrochloride slurry is decreased, and it is difficult to transfer the hydrochloride by a pump or the like in some cases.  A decrease of the productivity caused by the difficulties in transferring the liquid becomes particularly important when continuously carrying out the halogenation. [0009]<br>
In order to solve the above objects, the present inventors have conducted an extensive study and as a result, have found that the pressure at the time of the production of a hydrochloride of a linear or cyclic aliphatic amine is higher by 0.01 MPa or more than the atmospheric pressure, whereby it is possible to lower the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry. Thus, the present invention has been completed. If the fluidity is enhanced by the lowered viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry, a hydrochloride having an excellent liquid transfer property is obtained, which is particularly useful for the improvement of the productivity of the hydrochloride (particularly the improvement of the productivity when the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is continuously<br>
conducted). [0010]<br>
Furthermore, it was found that the pressure at the time of the production of a hydrochloride of a linear or cyclic aliphatic amine is in the aforementioned condition, whereby the increase of the particle diameter of the hydrochloride particle in the hydrochloride slurry can be suppressed and the increase of the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry can be suppressed.  It was also found that the yield of isocyanate is increased through the improvement of the conversion rate of hydrochloride at the phosgenation in some cases.<br>

So, the productivity of the hydrochloride is improved.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0032]<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in detail below. [0033]<br>
The process for producing a linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate of the present invention includes a step of reacting a linear or cyclic aliphatic amine with hydrogen chloride to yield a slurry containing a hydrochloride of a linear or cyclic aliphatic<br>
amine (hereinafter referred to as "reaction step for obtaining hydrochloride").  Furthermore, to produce the aforementioned isocyanate, a step of reacting the amine hydrochloride obtained by the aforementioned step with phosgene (hereinafter referred to as "phosgenation step") is involved, whereby the amine hydrochloride is phosgenated to produce an isocyanate.<br>
[0034]<br>
Reaction Step for obtaining Hydrochloride<br>
In the present invention, the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is carried out in a reactor under a pressure higher by 0.01 MPa or more than the atmospheric pressure, preferably 0.02 MPa or more, and more preferably 0.03 MPa or more.  Due to this, the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry obtained in the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride can be lowered, preferably to not more than 2,000 mPa•s.  Incidentally, the viscosity of the slurry is a value measured at 120 degree centigrade by using a Brookfield LVT viscometer.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the production process of the present invention comprising carrying out the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride under such a pressure, the fluidity and liquid transfer property are improved because of the lowered viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry, while a hydrochloride having excellent liquid transfer property which is particularly suitably applicable to the continuous reaction for obtaining hydrochloride can be produced. Accordingly, the productivity of the hydrochloride can be improved.<br>
[0036]<br>
Furthermore, according to the production process of the present invention, since the viscosity of the .hydrochloride slurry is in the above range, an unreacted raw material amine and a chlorine derivative generated from the unreacted raw material amine can be decreased in some cases because of the improvement of the mixing efficiency of the hydrochloride slurry.  As a result, the conversion rate of the raw material amine in the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is improved, and the yield of isocyanate is improved, and the like in some cases.  Furthermore, according to the production process of the present invention, the increase of the particle diameter of the hydrochloride particle contained in the hydrochloride slurry can be suppressed and the hydrochloride particle can be finer in some cases.  Due to this, the increase of the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry can be suppressed, and the yield of the isocyanate can be improved through the improvement of the conversion rate of hydrochloride at the phosgenation in some cases. [0037]<br>
In the present invention, the aforementioned linear or cyclic aliphatic amine is preferably a di- or higher functional linear or cyclic aliphatic amine.  When the aforementioned linear or cyclic aliphatic amine is a di- or higher functional linear or cyclic aliphatic amine, a hydrochloride of a di- or higher functional linear or cyclic aliphatic amine can be obtained by the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride.  Furthermore, the hydrochloride is phosgenated, whereby a di- or higher functional<br>
linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate can be obtained.  The di-or higher functional linear or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate is reacted with a compound having two or more active hydrogen containing groups, whereby a polymer compound such as polyurethane or the like can be obtained. Thus, it is of practically high value.<br>
[0038]<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the aforementioned reaction step for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably carried out in an organic solvent from the viewpoints of the stability of the reaction, the solubility of each component contributing to the reaction, and the like.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the present invention, the reactor used for the aforementioned reaction step for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably a tank reactor, and particularly a tank reactor equipped with a stirrer for stirring the inside. In the present invention, a tank reactor refers to a reactor equipped with a reaction vessel in which at least a part of a substance (reaction product, generated product, solvent or the like) involved in the reaction is present in a liquid phase thereinside, and a reactor satisfying the relations-hip of Dl/D2
whip shape for deteriorating the fluidity can be effectively suppressed.  When D/L is not more than 5.0, it is easy to stir uniformly.  As the result, the problem which unreacted amine is increased and the like can be effectively suppressed.  From the viewpoint of a balance of such effects, the reactor having the aforementioned ratio of D/L of not less than 0.5 and not more than 1.5 is further desirable.<br>
[0040]<br>
The reaction for obtaining hydrochloride can be carried out in various processes such as a process comprising introducing an organic solvent, preferably an organic aromatic solvent in a tank reactor, subjecting to a temperature elevation to a prescribed temperature and then adding a solvent with amine dissolved therein dropwise thereto and at the same time feeding hydrogen chloride gas, a process comprising heating the introduced solvent to a prescribed temperature, absorbing hydrogen chloride gas in advance and then adding an amine dissolved solution dropwise thereto and at the same time feeding hydrogen chloride gas, a process comprising heating a solvent with amine dissolved therein to a prescribed temperature and then feeding hydrogen chloride gas, or the like. The reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably carried out in any of the above-cited processes.  However, the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride carried out in processes other than the cited processes is not excluded.  In any of these processes, when hydrogen chloride gas is inserted, it is preferable that hydrogen chloride gas is blown into the organic solvent from the viewpoint of the reaction efficiency.<br>
[0041]<br>
The pressure in a tank reactor for carrying out the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride of the present invention is higher by 0.01 MPa or more than the atmospheric pressure from the viewpoint that the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry obtained in the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably not more than 2,000 mPa • s or the conversion rate of the raw material amine is preferably not less than 99 mole%. The pressure is more preferably higher by 0.02 MPa or more than the atmospheric pressure. The pressure is further preferably higher by 0.03 MPa or more than the atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0042]<br>
On the other hand, when the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is carried out under the atmospheric pressure, the particle diameter of the hydrochloride particle in the hydrochloride slurry becomes large or the viscosity of the hydrochloride slurry is increased so that the decrease of the mixing efficiency in the reactor is resulted due to the decrease of the liquid transfer property or the fluidity.  For that reason, the increase of unreacted amine or the increase of chloride generated in the reaction with phosgene might be resulted in some cases.<br>
[0043]<br>
In the present invention, when the upper limit of the pressure at the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is higher by 1.0 MPa or less than the atmospheric pressure, it is preferable that the solubility of hydrogen chloride gas in the hydrochloride slurry is increased so that the reaction speed at the reaction for<br>
obtaining hydrochloride is enhanced.  Furthermore, since the fluidity is improved, the liquid transfer property of the hydrochloride slurry preferably becomes excellent as well.  The pressure condition is more preferably 0.5 MPa or less than the atmospheric pressure, and further preferably 0.3 MPa or less than the atmospheric pressure.  When the pressure in the reactor for obtaining hydrochloride is extremely high, there occur some problems such that release of hydrogen chloride gas becomes worse, the hydrochloride slurry exhibits a whip shape, and the fluidity is adversely deteriorated in some cases.<br>
[0044]<br>
Incidentally, the lower limit and upper limit of the pressure at the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride can be in any combination. In the present invention, from the viewpoints of the above effects, the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably carried out under a pressure higher by not less than 0.01 MPa and not more than 1.0 MPa than the atmospheric pressure, and more preferably carried out under a pressure higher by not less than 0.01 MPa and not more than 0.5 MPa than the atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0045]<br>
According to the production process of the present invention, the conversion rate of the raw material amine can be not less than 99 mole% in some cases. When the conversion rate of the raw material amine is not less than 99 mole%, it is preferable that the yield of isocyanate is high and the influence of the by-product can be suppressed.<br>
[0046]<br>
The conversion rate of the raw material amine is measured in the following manner.  The amine remained in the slurry after the completion of the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is subjected to neutralization titration to calculate the mole number of the remained amine. From the mole number of the remained amine and the mole number of the introduced amine, the amine conversion rate is calculated according to the following formula.<br>
Formula: Amine conversion rate = ((mole number of introduced amine - mole number of remained amine) / mole number of introduced amine) x 100<br>
[0047]<br>
The total amine concentration in the present invention is preferably not less than 5 weight % and not more than 40 weight % in consideration of the industrial production efficiency.  The total amine concentration is a value calculated by dividing the amount of amine introduced into the reactor for obtaining hydrochloride by the total weight of the raw material introduced into the reactor for obtaining hydrochloride.<br>
[0048]<br>
When the concentration is not less than 5 weight %, it is preferable that the production efficiency is high.  When the concentration is not more than 40 weight %, problems of the deteriorated fluidity of the hydrochloride slurry, the reduced mixing efficiency due to the increase of the slurry viscosity, increased unreacted amine, decreased liquid transfer property, increased chloride at the reaction with phosgene and the like can<br>
be effectively suppressed.  For that reason, the total amine concentration is preferably not less than 5 weight % and not more than 35 weight %, and more preferably not less than 5 weight % and not more than 30 weight %.<br>
[0049]<br>
The temperature at the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride in the present invention is preferably not less than -20 degree centigrade and not more than 180 degree centigrade in consideration of the decrease of unreacted amine, prevention of a chlorine derivative generated as a by-product derived from the unreacted amine, fine particle diameter of generated hydrochloride, thermal balance at the time of shifting to the next reaction with phosgene or the like.<br>
[0050]<br>
When the temperature is not less than -20 degree centigrade, phenomena such that condensation of the hydrochloride particle is difficult and hydrochloride in the bulk state at the halogenation is generated can be effectively suppressed. When the temperature is not more than 180 degree centigrade, phenomena such that the generated hydrochloride exhibits a whip shape, the fluidity is damaged and it is difficult to transfer hydrochloride can be effectively suppressed.  The temperature at the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride is preferably not less than -20 degree centigrade and not more than 180 degree centigrade, more preferably not less than 60 degree centigrade and not more than 175 degree centigrade, and further preferably not less than 100 degree centigrade and not more than 170 degree centigrade.<br>
[0051]<br>
Phosgenation Step<br>
The reaction of a hydrochloride obtained by the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride with phosgene can also be carried out under a normal pressure or a pressure, but the phosgenation is preferably carried out under a normal pressure from the viewpoint of suppression of side reaction due to byproduced hydrogen chloride gas. Moreover, the temperature of the reaction with phosgene is not less than 120 degree centigrade and not more than 180 degree centigrade, preferably not less than 130 degree centigrade and not more than 175 degree centigrade, and further preferably not less than 150 degree centigrade and not more than 170 degree centigrade from the viewpoints of the reaction speed and suppression of converting generated isocyanate into tar.<br>
[0052]<br>
In the present invention, as the equivalent ratio of amine and hydrogen chloride gas at the reaction for obtaining hydrochloride, hydrogen chloride gas is not less than 1.0 and not more than 2.5 and preferably not less than 1.1 and not more than 2.0 based on 1.0 of amine. When it is not less than 1.0, the conversion rate of the raw material amine can be maintained high. When it is not more than 2.5, it is industrially more favorable from the viewpoint of the economical efficiency.<br>
[0053]<br>

The obtained hydrochloride slurry was in a liquid phase and excellent in the fluidity.  So, when the hydrochloride was transferred to the next step, the hydrochloride did not remain in the reactor and the liquid transfer property was excellent accordingly.<br>
Subsequently, the hydrochloride slurry transferred from the relay bath was heated to 160 degree centigrade in the reactor (phosgenation vessel) and then phosgene was blown at a rate of 1,129 kg/hr (11.4 kmole/hr) from the phosgene inlet tube. The reaction was carried out for 6 hours while maintaining the temperature. After the completion of the reaction, nitrogen in the system was purged to remove unreacted phosgene and hydrogen chloride gas. The reaction solution was filtered to remove 3.6 kg (dry weight) of unreacted hydrochloride. The obtained filtrate was desolvated to<br>
obtain 1, 603 kg (purity conversion yield: 98.50mole%) of m-xylene diisocyanate having a purity of 98.3% containing 0.4 weight % of CBi. The conversion rate of hydrochloride was 99.80 mole%. The results are shown in Table 1 to 3.<br>
