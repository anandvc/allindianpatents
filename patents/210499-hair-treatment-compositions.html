HAIR TREATMENT   COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
5<br>
The invention relates to hair treatment compositions.  More particularly the invention relates to hair treatment compositions comprising certain specific branched amine and/or hydroxy compounds.  The compositions are particularly 10  suitable for application to hair for repair and restoration of damaged hair.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
15  Hair can suffer damage from a number of sources.  The hair fibre can be damaged by environmental influences such as exposure to UV and chlorine; chemical influences such as bleaching, perming, overly frequent washing with harsh surfactant-based cleansing shampoo compositions; and<br>
20  mechanical influences such as prolonged use of heated styling appliances.<br>
r<br>
Damage to the hair typically manifests itself in cuticle and protein loss from the hair fibre, excessive fibre stiffness, 25  hair fibre brittleness and breakage and frayed or split ends.<br>
A wide array of ingredients are claimed to be effective in the treatment and prevention of hair damage, as can be seen 30  from the literature and from marketed products.<br><br>

Amino acids are commonly used to include protect and repair hair.  DE 3118882-A (Noronha RV), describes a tonic for hair which contains a mixture of amino acids.  In this mixture, a 5  1:4:12 histidine:lysine: arginine ratio is said to stimulate keratin formation.<br>
FR 2669224-A (Contier) describes a scalp treatment comprising amino-dicarboxylic acid complexed with a basic<br>
0  amino acid complex as the active ingredient.  The complex is said to prevent degradation of the hair root and improve the hydration of the hair keratin by neutralisation of scalp lactic acid.  US 4,201,235 (Mare Corp.) describes hair treatment with a "cocktail" of 20 different amino acids and<br>
5  vitamins to enhance softness, lustre and body.<br>
Amine oxides have also been used for the repair and protection of hair use is discussed in co-pending application number PCT/EP01/09275.<br>

thermotropic mesogenic material and with oily conditioning material prior to the incorporation of the conditioning material into the final hair conditioning composition<br>
5  Fatty Materials<br>
Conditioner compositions of the invention preferably additionally comprise fatty materials.  The combined use of fatty"materials and cationic surfactants in conditioning 10  compositions is believed to be especially advantageous,<br>
because this leads to the formation of a structured phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
By "fatty material" is meant a fatty alcohol, an alkoxylated 15  fatty alcohol, a fatty acid or a mixture thereof.<br>
Preferably, the alkyl chain of the fatty material is fully saturated.<br>
20  Representative fatty materials comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The  use of these materials is also advantageous in<br><br>
WO 2004/006874<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/006834<br><br>

that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
Alkoxylated, (e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated) fatty  5  alcohols having from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain can be used in place of, or in addition to, the fatty alcohols themselves.  Suitable examples include ethylene glycol cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (4) cetyl ether, and mixtures 10  thereof.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol material in conditioners of the invention is suitably from 0.01 to 15, preferably from 0.1 to 10, and more preferably from 0.1 to 5 wt%.  The weight ratio 15  of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 10:1 to 1:10, preferably from 4:1 to 1:8, optimally from 1:1 to 1:7, for example 1:3.<br><br>

Root end hair (as received from the supplier) was pre-cleaned<br>
by washing for 1 minute in Composition I followed by copious<br>
rinsing in double deionised water.  The hair was left to dry 10      naturally over 24 hrs.<br>
For each test, 4 g of hair was washed in 0.4 g of the test composition for 30 seconds, rinsed for 30 seconds, and the<br><br>

washing/rinsing cycle repeated.  The hair was left to dry naturally overnight.<br>
The hair was cut into 1 cm lengths, placed in a blender 5  bucket and 200 ml of double de-ionised water was added.  The blender was placed on full power for 1 minute.  The liquor was decanted off and transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,300 RPM.  The resulting clear liquor was decanted off leaving the cuticle sediment at 10  the bottom of the tube.<br>
The cuticle was transferred from the tube into a beaker with 3 x 5 ml washes and passed through a series of sieves (425 and 53 microns).  The sieves were washed with a further 2 x<br>
15  10 ml of water to ensure complete recovery of the cuticle. The sample was made up to 50 ml in a centrifuge tube, centrifuged for 15 minutes and the liquor decanted off. The cuticle was transferred with double deionised water (2 x 10 ml washes) to a beaker and freeze-dried.<br>
