				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL INTERMEDIATE FOR CARBAPENEM COMPOUND FOR ORAL<br>
ADMINISTRATION AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel ß-lactam<br>
compound which is extremely useful as a common intermediate<br>
for the synthesis of 1ß-methylcarbapenem compounds for oral<br>
administration and a process for producing the ß-lactam<br>
compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
1ß-Methylcarbapenem compounds exhibit excellent<br>
antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogenic<br>
microbes and have excellent stability in vivo. Thus, 1ß-<br>
methylcarbapenem compounds are one of the antimicrobial<br>
agents that are attracting most of the attention. Therefore,<br>
recently, energetical research and development has been<br>
conducted on drugs for oral administration. A currently<br>
commonly used process for producing a 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration will be described below.<br>
According to a production process described, for<br>
example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 8-53453 and the Journal of Antibiotics (J.<br>
Antibiot.), 429-439, 1997, a compound represented by general<br>
formula (7):<br><br>
is allowed to react with any of various thiol compounds (R-<br>
SH) to synthesize a compound represented by general formula<br><br>
(wherein R represents a thiol residue); the p-nitrobenzyl<br>
group, which is a protecting group, is eliminated, for<br>
example, by hydrogenolysis or by reduction using zinc dust<br>
to convert the compound (8) into a compound represented by<br>
general formula (9):<br><br>
(wherein R represents a thiol residue); and the carboxylic<br>
moiety of the resulting compound (9) is subjected, for<br>
example, to pivaloyloxymethylation to produce a compound<br>
represented by general formula (10):<br><br>
(wherein R represents a thiol residue, and But represents a<br>
tert-butyl group).<br>
Examples of the compound represented by general formula<br>
(10) include a compound represented by general formula (11):<br><br>
which is described in the Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 8-53453 and Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 10-195076; a compound<br>
represented by general formula (12):<br><br>
which is described in the Journal of Antibiotics (J.<br>
Antibiot.), 429-439, 1997, and Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 10-130270; and a compound<br>
represented by general formula (13):<br><br>
which is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 10-1524 91. All of these compounds are<br>
synthesized by the process described above.<br>
However, in order to synthesize a 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration by the process described<br>
above, replacement of a protecting group of carboxylic acid<br>
is required, and a multistep reaction must be carried out,<br>
thus being ineffective. Moreover, a relatively expensive<br>
Vthiol compound, which remains as a thiol residue in the end<br>
product, is used at the initial step of synthesis, thus<br>
being disadvantageous in terms of production cost and giving<br>
rise to a problem.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication Nos. 8-59663 and 2000-344774 each describe a<br>
process in which from a compound represented by general<br>
formula (14):<br><br>
(wherein R4 represents a protecting group of the hydroxyl<br>
group, R5 represents a thiol residue contained in the<br>
reaction product 1ß-methylcarbapenem compound, and R6<br>
represents an organic group), a compound represented by<br>
general formula (15):<br><br>
(wherein R4, R5, and R6 are the same as above; and R7, R8,<br>
and R9 each represent a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms; or one of R7, R8, and R9 represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the remaining two of R7,<br>
R8, and R9 each represent a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms) is synthesized, and the compound (15) is<br>
cyclized to produce a compound represented by general<br>
formula (16):<br><br>
(wherein R4, R5, and R6 are the same as above).<br>
However, in this production process, as in the process<br>
previously described, a relatively expensive thiol compound,<br>
which remains as a thiol residue in the end product, is used<br>
at the initial step of synthesis, thus being disadvantageous<br>
in terms of production cost and giving rise to a problem.<br>
The Journal of Organic Chemistry (J. Org. Chem), 61,<br>
7889-7894, 1996, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 5-279367 each describe a compound<br>
represented by formula (17):<br><br>
(wherein Me represents a methyl group, and But is the same<br>
as above). It can be conceived that a 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound may be derived from this compound through reaction<br>
with any of various thiol compounds and deprotection of the<br>
hydroxyl group. However, in the compound (17), since the<br>
protecting group of the hydroxyl group is a tert-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl group, a reaction reagent that may affect<br>
the other functional groups must be used for the<br>
deprotection of the hydroxyl moiety, as exemplified in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New<br>
York), 44-46, 1981. Thus, there is a problem in terms of<br>
yield, etc. Although the present inventors have examined<br>
various methods for deprotection, it has not been possible<br>
to perform the deprotection easily and efficiently.<br>
Under these circumstances, it has been desired to<br>
develop a common intermediate capable of producina 1ß-<br>
methylcarbapenem compounds efficiently and advantageously in<br>
terms of production cost.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have conducted energetical<br>
research on the development of a novel ß-lactam compound and<br>
a process for producing the ß-lactam compound which allows a<br>
thiol compound to be introduced in one step at, the final<br>
stage in the synthesis of a ßP-methylcarbapenem compound for<br>
oral administration, and as a result, the present invention<br>
has been achieved.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a process for<br>
producing a ß-lactam compound including protecting the<br>
hydroxyl group of a compound represented by general formula<br><br>

and R3 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms), to<br>
produce a compound represented by general formula (2):<br><br>
(wherein R1 represents a trimethylsilyl group or a<br>
triethylsilyl group; and R2 and R3 are the same as above);<br>
cyclizing the compound (2) in the presence of a strong base;<br>
and subsequently allowing the cyclized compound to react<br>
with diphenylphosphoryl chloride to produce a compound<br>
represented by general formula (3):<br><br>
(wherein R1 and R3 are the same as above).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a process<br>
for producing a ß-lactam compound represented by general<br>
formula (4):<br><br>
(wherein R3 is the same as above), the process including<br>
deprotecting the hydroxyl moiety of the compound (3)<br>
produced by the process described above.<br>

(wherein R1 and R3 are the same as above) .<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a compound<br>
represented by general formula (4):<br><br>
(wherein R3 is the same as above).<br>
Detailed Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing<br>
a ß-lactam compound, the process including protecting the<br>
hydroxyl group of a compound represented by general formula<br>
(1):<br><br>
to produce a compound represented by general formula (2):<br><br>
cyclizing the compound (2) in the presence of a strong base-,<br>
and subsequently allowing the cyclized compound to react<br>
with diphenylphosphoryl chloride to produce a compound<br>
represented by general formula (3):<br><br>
In the present invention, preferably, the compound<br>
represented by general formula (1) is produced by allowing a<br>
compound represented by general formula (5):<br><br>
to react with a compound represented by general formula (6):<br><br>
in the presence of a base.<br>
In the present invention, the compound represented by<br>
general formula (3) produced by the process for producing<br>
the ß-lactam compound may be converted into a ß-lactam<br>
compound represented by general formula (4):<br><br>
through deprotection of the hydroxyl moiety.<br>
First, the substituents in the compounds will be<br>
described. In formulae (2) and (3), the protecting group R1<br>
of the hydroxyl group is a trimethylsilyl group or a<br>
triethylsilyl group, and particularly preferably a<br>
trimethylsilyl group. The present inventors have found,<br>
through energetical research, that these substituents can be<br>
eliminated under mild reaction conditions with minimum<br>
decomposition of the other functional group moieties during<br>
deprotection reaction of the protecting group R1 of the<br>
compound (3) used in the production process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In formulae (1), (2), and (5), R2, which is a thiol<br>
residue, represents an aryl group or a heteroaryl group that<br>
may be substituted with a halogen atom, such as chlorine,<br>
bromine, or iodine, a nitro group, an alkyl group having 1<br>
to 3 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
Examples of the aryl group include a phenyl group, a<br>
halogenophenyl group substituted with one to three halogen<br>
atoms, such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, a p-nitrophenyl<br>
group, an o-nitrophenyl group, a p-methoxyphenyl group, a 1-<br>
naphthyl group, and a 2-naphthyl group.<br>
Examples of the heteroaryl group include a 2-pyridyl<br>
group, a 3-pyridyl group, a 4-pyridyl group, a 2-pyrimidyl<br>
group, a 2-(4,6-dimethyl)pyrimidyl group, a 2-benzothiazolyl<br>
group, a 2-benzimidazolyl group, a 2-benzoxazolyl group, and<br>
a 2-thienyl group.<br>
As R2, an aryl group is preferable, and a phenyl group<br>
and a halogenophenyl group are more preferable in view of<br>
ease of availability, economics, reactivity, etc. As the<br>
halogenophenyl group, a p-chlorophenyl group is preferable.<br>
In formulae (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6), the<br>
substituent R3, which is ultimately contained in the<br>
alkanoyloxymethyl moiety of the carboxylate residue in a<br>
compound that can be developed as a 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration, represents an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3<br>
to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-propyl, an<br>
isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a sec-<br>
butyl group, a tert-butyl group, a n-octyl group, and a n-<br>
decanyl group.<br>
The cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms may<br>
have a substituent, and as the substituent, an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as a methyl group or an<br>
ethyl group, may be mentioned. Examples of the cycloalkyl<br>
group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms include a cyclopropyl<br>
group, a cyclohexyl group, a 1-methylcyclohexyl group, and a<br>
4-methylcyclohexyl group.<br>
As the substituent R3, a tert-butyl group, which is<br>
often used in the development of carbapenem compounds for<br>
oral administration, is particularly preferable.<br>
In formula (6), the substituent X represents a halogen<br>
atom, such as a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine<br>
atom, or an iodine atom. In view of ease of availability,<br>
reactivity, stability, etc. of the compound (6), a chlorine<br>
atom is particularly preferable.<br>
Production processes of the present invention will now<br>
be described below.<br>
The compound represented by general formula (5), which<br>
is preferably used as a starting material in the present<br>
invention, can be easily produced, for example, by a process<br>
described in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin (Chem.<br>
Pharm. Bull.), 42, 1381-1387, 1994. This compound can be<br>
easily synthesized in the form of a desired optically active<br>
substance as a material for synthesis of a 1ß-<br>
methylcarbapenem compound.<br>
By allowing the compound (5) to react with an<br>
alkanoyloxymethyl halide represented by formula (6) in the<br>
presence of a base, a ß-lactam compound represented by<br>
formula (1) can be derived.<br>
The reaction is carried out using an inert solvent that<br>
does not decompose the compound (5) and the compound (6).<br>
The inert solvent is not particularly limited. Examples<br>
thereof include ether solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, and diethyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents,<br>
such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; amide solvents, such<br>
as N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide; dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone, methylene chloride, and<br>
mixed solvents of these. From the standpoint of reaction<br>
rate, N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide are<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
The amount of the alkanoyloxymethyl halide (6) used for<br>
the reaction must be 1.0 or more molar times and is<br>
preferably 1.1 to 3.0 molar times the amount of the compound<br>
(5).<br>
Furthermore, as the base, any base that is generally<br>
used in the reaction for forming an ester using a carboxylic<br>
acid and an alkyl halide can be used. Examples thereof<br>
include organic amines and alkali metal salts.<br>
Examples of the organic amines include triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, 1,8-<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and morpholine. The<br>
amount of use thereof must be 1.0 or more molar times and is<br>
preferably 1.1 to 2.0 molar times the amount of the compound<br>
(5).<br>
Furthermore, examples of the alkali metal salts include<br>
alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, and cesium carbonate; and alkali metal<br>
bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium<br>
bicarbonate. When an alkali metal carbonate is used, the<br>
amount of use thereof must be 0.5 or more molar times and is<br>
preferably 1.1 to 2.0 molar times the amount of the compound<br>
(5). When an alkali metal bicarbonate is used, the amount<br>
of use thereof must be 1.0 or more molar times and is<br>
preferably 1.1 to 2.0 molar times the amount of the compound<br>
(5).<br>
Furthermore, an additive, as a reaction promoter, may<br>
be added to the reaction described above if necessary.<br>
Examples of the additive include alkali metal halides, such<br>
as sodium iodide and lithium bromide; and quaternary<br>
ammonium halides, such as tetrabutylammonium bromide and<br>
benzyltriethylammonium chloride. The amount of use thereof<br>
is preferably 1.0 or more molar times and most preferably<br>
1.0 to 1.5 molar times the amount of the compound (6).<br>
The reaction described above is usually carried out at<br>
0°C to 80°C. From the standpoint of inhibiting<br>
decomposition of the reactants and product, the reaction is<br>
preferably carried out at 10°C to 40°C.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction time is usually 1 to 50 hours<br>
and preferably 2 to 30 hours from the same standpoint.<br>
Of course, the progress of reaction can be determined<br>
by analytical means, such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC)<br>
or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The target compound (1) can be isolated from the<br>
reaction mixture by means of pH adjustment, extraction,<br>
liquids separation, washing, concentration, purification,<br>
and others, which are often commonly performed in organic<br>
reactions.<br>
Additionally, the compound (1) obtained by the reaction<br>
described above is a novel compound, of which application as<br>
a useful precursor for producing a common intermediate for<br>
the synthesis of 1ß-methylcarbapenem compounds for oral<br>
administration has been confirmed by the present inventors.<br>
The compound (1) obtained by the reaction described<br>
above is subsequently converted into the compound (2) by the<br>
protection of the hydroxyl group.<br>
This is a reaction in which a silyl protecting group is<br>
introduced into the hydroxyl group, and general conditions<br>
for introducing the silyl protecting group, for example,<br>
those described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (J.<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, New York), 39-50, 1981, may be employed. In<br>
the present invention, a trimethylsilyl group or a<br>
triethylsilyl group is introduced. The compound (2) can be<br>
derived by allowing the compound (1) to react with<br>
chlorotrimethylsilane or chlorotriethylsilane in an inert<br>
solvent in the presence of a base, such as an amine. This<br>
method is most commonly used and is most suitable for the<br>
production of the compound (2).<br>
The amount of chlorotrimethylsilane or<br>
chlorotriethylsilane used in this stage must be 1.0 or more<br>
molar times and is preferably 1.1 to 3.0 molar times the<br>
amount of the compound (1).<br>
Furthermore, examples of the amine used as the base<br>
include triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, and<br>
imidazole. The amount of use thereof must be 1.0 or more<br>
molar times and is preferably 1.1 to 3.0 molar times the<br>
amount of the compound (1).<br>
As the inert solvent, any solvent that is inert so as<br>
not to decompose the chlorotrialkylsilane described above<br>
may be used without limitation. Examples thereof include<br>
ether solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and<br>
diethyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, such as<br>
benzene, toluene, and xylene; amide solvents, such as N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide; dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone, methylene chloride, and<br>
mixed solvents of these.<br>
The reaction described above is usually carried out at<br>
0°C to 100°C. From the standpoint of inhibiting<br>
decomposition of the reactants and product, the reaction is<br>
preferably carried out at 10°C to 60°C.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction time is usually 0.5 to 50<br>
hours and preferably 1 to 30 hours from the same standpoint.<br>
Additionally, as described above, the progress of<br>
reaction can be followed by analytical means.<br>
The compound (2) can be isolated from the reaction<br>
mixture by means of pH adjustment, extraction, liquids<br>
separation, washing, concentration, purification, and others,<br>
which are often commonly performed in organic reactions.<br>
During this stage, if the compound (2) is subjected to<br>
acidic conditions, the protecting group on the hydroxyl<br>
group is eliminated and the compound (2) reverts back to the<br>
starting compound (1) . Therefore, sufficient care must be<br>
taken not to cause acidic conditions.<br>
The compound (2) obtained by the reaction described<br>
above is converted into the compound (3) by cyclization in<br>
the presence of a strong base and subsequent treatment with<br>
diphenylphosphoryl chloride.<br>
Examples of the strong base which may be preferably<br>
used in the cyclization reaction of the compound (2) include<br>
alkali metal alkoxides, such as potassium tert-butoxide and<br>
sodium tert-butoxide; alkali metal amides, such as lithium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide,<br>
and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide; and alkali metal<br>
hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride. In<br>
this reaction, since the thioester group and the<br>
alkanoyloxymethyl group are present in the compound (2) , a<br>
base that minimizes the decomposition of these functional<br>
groups is desired, and potassium tert-butoxide, sodium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, and sodium hydride are<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
Furthermore, the strong base is used desirably in an<br>
amount that allows the cyclization reaction to proceed<br>
sufficiently. Preferably, the amount of use is 2 to 3 molar<br>
times the amount of the compound (2).<br>
In the cyclization reaction, as cyclization progresses,<br>
formation of a metal thiolate as a by-product occurs. In<br>
order to convert the metal thiolate into a compound in a<br>
form that does not adversely affect the subsequent reaction,<br>
a scavenger is preferably used.<br>
Examples of the scavenger which may be used include<br>
alkylating agents, such as methyl iodide, propyl iodide,<br>
allyl bromide, benzyl bromide, and methyl p-<br>
toluenesulphonate; sulfonylating agents, such as p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride and methanesulfoayl chloride; and<br>
phosphorylating agents, such as diphenylphosphoryl chloride.<br>
The scavenger is used desirably in an amount equal to the<br>
amount of the metal thiolate formed from the compound (2) as<br>
a by-product. Preferably, the amount of use is 1.0 to 1.5<br>
molar times the amount of the compound (2).<br>
Subsequently, the compound (3) is produced by reaction<br>
between the reaction intermediate obtained by cyclizing the<br>
compound (2) and diphenylphosphoryl chloride. This reaction<br>
is usually carried out in the same reactor vessel as that<br>
used for the cyclization reaction.<br>
Diphenylphosphoryl chloride must be used in an amount<br>
that allows the reaction to proceed sufficiently. The<br>
amount of use is preferably 1.0 to 1.5 molar times the<br>
amount of the compound (2). Since diphenylphosphoryl<br>
chloride can also act as a scavenger as described above, in<br>
such a case, diphenylphosphoryl chloride is used in an<br>
amount of 2 or more molar times the amount of the compound<br>
(2) so that the metal thiolate is trapped and so as to also<br>
serve as a phosphorylating agent.<br>
The cyclization and phosphorylation reactions described<br>
above are carried out in an inert solvent. The inert<br>
solvent is not particularly limited. Preferred examples<br>
thereof include ether solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, and diethyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents,<br>
such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; amide solvents, such<br>
as N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide; dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone, methylene chloride, and<br>
mixed solvents of these. From the standpoints of<br>
solubilities of the base and the compound (2),<br>
tetrahydrofuran or a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and<br>
toluene are most preferable. The mixing ratio is not<br>
particularly limited as long as the reaction reagent is<br>
dissolved.<br>
The cyclization and phosphorylation reactions described<br>
above are usually carried out at -78°C to 60°C. From the<br>
standpoint of inhibiting decomposition of the reactants and<br>
product, the reactions are preferably carried out at -78°C<br>
to 10°C.<br>
Furthermore, the cyclization reaction time is usually 1<br>
minute to 20 hours, and preferably 5 minutes to 5 hours.<br>
Furthermore, the phosphorylation reaction time is<br>
usually 5 minutes to 30 hours, and preferably 30 minutes to<br>
10 hours.<br>
Additionally, as described above, the progress of<br>
reactions can be followed by analytical means.<br>
The compound (3) can be isolated from the reaction<br>
mixture by means of pH adjustment, extraction, liquids<br>
separation, washing, concentration, purification, and others,<br>
which are often commonly performed in organic reactions.<br>
Additionally, the compound (3) obtained by the<br>
reactions described above is a novel compound, of which<br>
application as a useful precursor for producing a common<br>
intermediate for the synthesis of 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compounds for oral administration has been confirmed by the<br>
present inventors.<br>
Subsequently, the compound (4) can be derived from the<br>
compound (3) by eliminating Rl, i.e., the protecting group<br>
of the hydroxyl group<br>
As the method for deprotection, general deprotection<br>
conditions for eliminating the silyl protecting group, for<br>
example, those described in Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis (J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York), 39-50, 1981, may be<br>
employed.<br>
In order to eliminate the protecting group under mild<br>
reaction conditions with minimum decomposition of the other<br>
functional group moieties in the compound during the<br>
deprotection reaction, a method is preferably used in which<br>
the pH of the reaction mixture after the cyclization and<br>
phosphorylation of the compound (2) is adjusted so as to<br>
achieve acidic conditions, and thus the hydroxyl moiety is<br>
deprotected. However, the compound (4) may be derived from<br>
the compound (3) after the compound (3) has been recovered.<br>
The acidic conditions used in this stage are not<br>
particularly limited as long as the pH is 7 or less.<br>
Preferably, the pH is 2 to 6. Thereby, the silyl protecting<br>
group can be extremely easily eliminated. Furthermore, in<br>
order to create the acidic conditions, for example,<br>
phosphoric acid, aqueous citric acid, hydrochloric acid, or<br>
the like may be added to the mixture.<br>
The compound (4) is a novel compound, and as will be<br>
described below, useful application of the compound (4) as a<br>
common intermediate for the synthesis of 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compounds for oral administration has been confirmed by the<br>
present inventors for the first time.<br>
By allowing the compound (4) thus obtained to react<br>
with a thiol compound (R'-SH) in the presence of a base, any<br>
of 1ß-methylcarbapenem compounds represented by general<br>
formula (20):<br><br>
(wherein R' represents a thiol residue; and R3 is the same<br>
as above) can be derived by one step.<br>
Furthermore, by allowing the compound (3) before the<br>
deprotection to react with a thiol compound in the presence<br>
with a base, a 1ß-methylcarbapenem compound represented by<br>
general formula (21):<br><br>
(wherein R', R1, and R3 are the same as above) is obtained,<br>
and then by deprotecting the hydroxyl moiety, any of 1ß-<br>
methylcarbapenem compounds for oral administration may be<br>
derived. Without isolating the compound (3) or (4), a<br>
desired lP-methylcarbapenem compound can be derived directly.<br>
In such a case, first, as described above, the compound<br>
(2) is cyclized and then a phosphorylation reaction with<br>
diphenylphosphoryl chloride is carried out to produce the<br>
compound (3). Subsequently, the compound (3) is allowed to<br>
react with a thiol compound (R'-SH) in the presence of a<br>
base.<br>
Here, the base used in the reaction with the thiol<br>
compound may be the same as or different from the strong<br>
base used in the cyclization reaction described above.<br>
As the base other than the strong base used in the<br>
cyclization of the compound (2) described above, an organic<br>
amine or an alkali metal salt can be used. Examples of the<br>
organic amine include triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine,<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[ 5.4.0]-undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU), 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene (DBN), and 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo[ 2.2.2] octane (DABCO). Examples of the alkali<br>
metal salt include alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, and cesium carbonate; and<br>
alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and<br>
potassium bicarbonate.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction may be accelerated by the<br>
addition of a different inert solvent from the one used in<br>
the cyclization reaction.<br>
Preferred examples of the inert solvent which is<br>
further added to accelerate the reaction include<br>
acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide.<br>
The 1P-methylcarbapenem compound produced as described<br>
above can be converted into a desired 1ß-methylcarbapenem<br>
compound for oral administration by the above-described<br>
common method in which deprotection of the hydroxyl group is<br>
performed, and preferably by a deprotection method in which<br>
the conditions are set to be the same as those described<br>
above to minimize the decomposition of the other functional<br>
group moieties.<br>

The reaction solution was diluted with 5 ml of toluene, and<br>
washing was performed several times with water. The<br>
resulting toluene solution was dried over sodium sulfate,<br>
and then the solvent was removed by distillation.<br>
The resulting oily residue was dissolved in 8 ml of<br>

detection was made at the same retention time as that for<br>
the product produced in Example 5, which will be described<br>

i.e., the protecting group of the hydroxyl group, was easily<br>
eliminated.<br>

pivaloyloxymethyl ester synthesized as in Example 4 in 15 ml<br>
of acetonitrile, and 0.57 g (4.9 mmol) of a compound<br>
represented by formula (19):<br><br>
was added thereto. Subsequently, 0.7 9 g (6.1 mmol) of<br>
diisopropylethylamine was added dropwise thereto at 5°C, and<br>
stirring was performed at the same temperature for 70<br>
minutes. After the reaction was completed, acetonitrile was<br>
removed by distillation. The residue was dissolved in 40 ml<br>
of ethyl acetate, and washing was performed several times<br>
with aqueous sodium bicarbonate to remove diphenylphosphoric<br>
acid which was formed as a by-product. Water was added to<br>
the resulting ethyl acetate solution, and 1 N aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid was added thereto to achieve pH 3. The<br>
ethyl acetate solution obtained by a separation process was<br>
washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate and water, and then<br>
dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed by<br>
distillation, and the residue was dissolved in 20 mL of<br>
acetone. Toluene (30 mL) was added to the resulting<br>
solution, and the acetone solvent was gradually removed by<br>
distillation. Formation of a white, turbid solution was<br>
confirmed. The white, turbid solution was stirred at 0°C to<br>
5°C for 1 hour, and white crystals were obtained by<br>
filtration and washing. The white crystals were dissolved<br>
in acetone again, and as in the above process, through<br>
addition of toluene, removal of the solvent by distillation,<br>
stirring, filtration, and washing, 0.70 g of white crystals<br>
containing the target compound was obtained.<br>
