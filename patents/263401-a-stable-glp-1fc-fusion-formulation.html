				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to formulations of glucagon-like peptide analogs<br>
fused to proteins that have the effect of stabilizing the fusion proteins. These<br>
formulations can be used to treat diabetes as well as a variety of other conditions or<br>
disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs and derivatives show promise in clinical<br>
trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 induces numerous biological effects<br>
such as stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, inhibiting gastric<br>
emptying, inhibiting gastric molility or intestinal motility, and inducing weight loss. A<br>
significant characteristic of GLP-1 is its ability to stimulate insulin secretion without the<br>
associated risk of hypoglycemia that is seen when using insulin therapy or some types of<br>
oral therapies that act by increasing insulin expression.<br>
The usefulness of therapy involving GLP-1 peptides has been limited by the fact<br>
that GLP-l(l-37) is poorly active, and the two naturally occurring truncated peptides,<br>
GLP-1 (7-37)OH and GLP-1 (7-36)NH2, are rapidly cleared in vivo and have extremely<br>
short in vivo half lives. It is known that endogenously produced dipeptidyl-peptidase IV<br>
(DPP-IV) inactivates circulating GLP-1 peptides by removing the N-terminal histidine<br>
and alanine residues and is a major reason for the short in vivo half-life.<br>
Various approaches have been undertaken to extend the elimination half-life of a<br>
GLP-1 peptide or reduce clearance of the peptide from the body while maintaining<br>
biological activity. One approach involves fusing a GLP-1 peptide to the Fc portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulins typically have long circulating half-lives in vivo.<br>
For example, IgG molecules can have a half-life in humans of up to 23 days. The<br>
Fc portion of the immunoglobulin is responsible, in part, for this in vivo stability. GLP-1 -<br>
Fc fusion proteins take advantage of the stability provided by the Fc portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin while preserving the biological activity of the GLP-1 molecule.<br>
Although this approach is feasible for GLP-1 therapeutics (See WO 02/46227),<br>
there is a general concern regarding the antigenicity of various fusion proteins when<br>
administered repeatedly over prolonged periods of time. This is especially a concern for<br>
-2-<br><br>
GLP-l-Fc fusion therapeutics as a patient with diabetes must be treated for her entire life<br>
once diagnosed with the disease. In addition, Fc fusion protein therapeutics can be a<br>
concern if the Fc portion retains unwanted effector functions. This approach is the focus<br>
of PCT/US 04/15595 (WO2005/000892), in which problems associated with the potential<br>
immunogenicity and effector activity associated with administration of GLP-l-Fc fusions<br>
are overcome by identifying specific GLP-l-Fc fusion proteins that have a reduced risk of<br>
inducing an immune response after repeated and prolonged administration and no longer<br>
have effector function.<br>
The fusion proteins of this nature are technically too large and complex to produce<br>
synthetically or recombinantly in bacterial cells. These fusion proteins are typically<br>
produced in mammalian cells, such as CHO, 293, or NSO. It was observed that the fusion<br>
proteins produced in mammalian cells where more readily susceptible to degradation by<br>
endogenous proteases and chemical alteration than non-fusion proteins produced in<br>
bacterial cells. This problem was sought to be overcome in the present invention. It is<br>
discovered that a formulation comprising a GLP-l-Fc fusion buffered between about pH<br>
6 and about pH 8.5 provided increased chemical stability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to overcome the problem of chemical stability of GLP-l-Fc fusions, the<br>
present inventors have developed a stable solution formulation. In particular, the<br>
inventors have discovered that a formulation comprising a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a GLP-l-Fc fusion at a pH between about pH 6 and about pH 8.5, preferably<br>
between about pH 6 and about pH 7.5, between about pH 6 and about pH 7, between<br>
about pH 6.5 and about pH 7.5, or between about pH 6 and about pH 6.5, and even more<br>
preferably, about pH 6 or about 6.5, provided unexpectedly and considerably greater<br>
chemical stability than when compared to GLP-l-Fc fusions at a pH outside the described<br>
ranges.<br>
The present invention also includes methods of treating patients suffering from<br>
non-insulin dependent as well as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, and various<br>
other disorders and conditions comprising administering the formulations of GLP-l-Fc<br>
fusions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The fusion proteins comprise a GLP-1 compound fused to an Fc portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin, an analog of an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, or a fragment of an<br>
Fc portion of an immunoglobulin. The C-terminus of the GLP-1 compound may be fused<br>
directly, or fused via a peptide linker, to the N-terminus of an Fc protein. These fusion<br>
proteins are biologically active and have an increased half-life compared to native GLP-1.<br>
The GLP-1 compounds that make up part of the fusion protein encompass polypeptides<br>
having from about twenty-five to about thirty-nine naturally occurring or non-naturally<br>
occurring amino acids that have sufficient homology to native GLP-1 (7-37)OH such that<br>
they exhibit insulinotropic activity by binding to the GLP-1 receptor on P-cells in the<br>
pancreas. A GLP-1 compound typically comprises a polypeptide having the amino acid<br>
sequence of GLP-1 (7-37)OH, an analog of GLP-1 (7-37)OH, a fragment of GLP-1 (7-<br>
37)OH or a fragment of a GLP-1 (7-37)OH analog.<br>
Examples of fusion proteins useful in the formulations include fusion proteins<br>

The C-terminus of the GLP-1 analog portion and the N-terminus of the Fc portion<br>
of the fusion proteins are preferably fused together via 1, 1.5 or 2 repeats of a G-rich<br>
peptide linker having the sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-<br>
Gly-Gly-Ser (SEQ ID NO:8).<br>
The fusion proteins useful in the formulations of the present invention<br>
comprise a GLP-1 analog portion and an Fc portion. The GLP-1 analog portion<br>
and the Fc portion comprise substitutions to the native GLP-1 sequence and the<br>
human IgG4 sequence respectively that provide the protein with increased<br>
potency and in vivo stability compared to native GLP-1 or GLP-1 analogs not<br>
fused to an Fc sequence while decreasing the potential for inducing antibody<br>
formation after prolonged and repeated administration in humans.<br>
Native GLP-1 is processed in vivo such that the first 6 amino acids are cleaved<br>
from the molecule. Thus, by custom in the art, the amino terminus of GLP-1 has been<br>
assigned the number 7 and the carboxy-terminus, number 37. The other amino acids in<br>
the polypeptide are numbered consecutively as shown in SEQ ID NO:9. For example,<br>
position 8 is alanine and position 22 is glycine. The processed peptide may be further<br>
modified in vivo such that the C-terminal glycine residue is removed and replaced with an<br>
amide group. Thus, GLP-1(7-37)QH and GLP-1 (7-36)amide represent the two native<br>
forms of the molecule. GLP-1 (7-37)OH has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9:<br>
7His-Ala-Glu-10Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-l5Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-20Leu-Glu-Gly-<br>
Gln-Ala-25Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-De-3OAla-Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-35Gly-Arg-37Gly<br>
(SEQ ID NO:9)<br>
The GLP-1 analog portion of the fusion protein comprises three primary<br>
substitutions at positions 8, 22, and 36 relative to native GLP-1 (7-37). The<br>
substitution at position 8 reduces the rate at which the endogenous enzyme<br>
dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inactivates the analog. DPP-IV cleaves native<br>
GLP-1 between the 2nd and 3rd amino acids (between position 8 and 9) and the<br>
resulting molecule is less active. Thus, the fusion proteins useful in the<br>
formulations of the present invention are DPP-IV resistant. The substitution at<br>
position 22 reduces the potential of the molecule to aggregate and increases the<br>
-6-<br><br>
potency of the molecule. The substitution at position 36 in the context of the<br>
analog with changes at 8 and 22 as well as in the context of the entire fusion<br>
protein reduces the risk that the fusion protein will induce a neutralizing immune<br>
response after repeated and prolonged administration in humans.<br>
The GLP-1 analog C-terminus is preferably one of the following<br>
sequences: Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-Gly-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO: 10); Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-<br>
Gly-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:11); Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-Gly-Gly-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 12);<br>
Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 13); Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-Gly-Gly<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 14); and Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO: 15).<br>
The fusion proteins useful in the formulations of the present invention<br>
contain an Fc portion which is derived from human IgG4, but comprises one or<br>
more substitutions compared to the wild-type human sequence. As used herein,<br>
the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin has the meaning commonly given to the<br>
term in the field of immunology. Specifically, this term refers to an antibody<br>
fragment which does not contain the two antigen binding regions (the Fab<br>
fragments) from the antibody. The Fc portion consists of the constant region of<br>
an antibody from both heavy chains, which associate through non-covalent<br>
interactions and disulfide bonds. The Fc portion can include the hinge regions<br>
and extend through the CH2 and CH3 domains to the c-terminus of the antibody.<br>
The Fc portion can further include one or more glycosylation sites.<br>
There are five types of human immunoglobulins with different effector<br>
functions and pharmcokinetic properties. IgG is the most stable of the five types<br>
having a serum half-life in humans of about 23 days. There are four IgG<br>
subclasses (Gl, G2, G3, and G4) each of which have different biological<br>
functions known as effector functions. These effector functions are generally<br>
mediated through interaction with the Fc receptor (FcyR) or by binding Clq and<br>
fixing complement. Binding to FcyR can lead to antibody dependent cell<br>
mediated cytolysis, whereas binding to complement factors can lead to<br>
complement mediated cell lysis. In designing Fc fusion proteins wherein the Fc<br>
portion is being utilized solely for its ability to extend half-life, it is important to<br>
minimize any effector function. Thus, the fusion proteins useful in the<br>
formulations of the present invention are derived from the human IgG4 Fc region<br><br>
because of its reduced ability to bind FeyR and complement factors compared to<br>
other IgG sub-types. IgG4, however, has been shown to deplete target cells in<br>
humans [Issacs et al., (1996) CHn. Exp. Immunol. 106:427-433]. Because the<br>
fusion proteins target beta cells in the pancreas to induce insuJin expression,<br>
using an IgG4 derived region in an Fc fusion protein could initiate an immune<br>
response against the pancreateic beta cell through interaction of the fusion<br>
protein with the GLP-1 receptor present on pancreatic beta cells. Thus, the IgG4<br>
Fc region which is part of the fusion proteins contains substitutions that eliminate<br>
effector function. The lgG4 Fc portion of the fusion proteins may contain one or<br>
more of the following substitutions: substitution of proline for glutamate at<br>
residue 233, alanine or valine for phenylalanine at residue 234 and alanine or<br>
glutamate for leucine at residue 235 (EU numbering, Kabat, E.A. et al. (1991)<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5' Ed. U.S. Dept. of Health<br>
and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, NIH Publication no. 91-3242). These<br>
residues corresponds to positions 16, 17 and 18 in SEQ ID NO:7. Further,<br>
removing the N-linked glycosylation site in the IgG4 Fc region by substituting<br>
Ala for Asn at residue 297 (EU numbering) which corresponds to position 80 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:7 is another way to ensure that residual effector activity is<br>
eliminated in the context of a fusion protein.<br>
In addition, the IgG4 Fc portion of the fusion proteins contain a<br>
substitution that stabilizes heavy chain dimer formation and prevents the<br>
formation of half-IgG4 Fc chains. The fusion proteins preferably exist as dimers<br>
joined together by disulfide bonds and various non-covalent interactions. Wild-<br>
type IgG4 contains a Pro-Pro-Cys-Pro-Ser-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 16) motif beginning<br>
at residue 224 (EU numbering). This motif in a single GLP-1 analog-Fc chain<br>
forms disulfide bonds with the corresponding motif in another GLP-1 analog-Fc<br>
chain. However, the presence of serine in the motif causes the formation of<br>
single chain fusion proteins. The present invention encompasses Fc fusion<br>
proteins wherein the IgG4 sequence is further modified such that serine at<br>
position at 228 (EU numbering) is substituted with proline (amino acid residue<br>
llinSEQIDNO:7).<br>
The C-termina] lysine residue present in the native molecule may be<br>
-8-<br><br>
deleted in the IgG4 derivative Fc portion of the fusion proteins discussed herein<br>
(position 230 of SEQ ID NO:7; deleted lysine referred to as des-K). Fusion<br>
proteins expressed in some cell types (such as NSO cells) wherein lysine is<br>
encoded by the C-terminal codon are heterogeneous in that a portion of the<br>
molecules have lysine as the C-terminal amino acid and a portion have lysine<br>
deleted. The deletion is due to protease action during expression in some types<br>
of mammalian cells. Thus, to avoid this heterogeneity, it is preferred that Fc<br>
fusion expression constructs lack a C-terminal codon for lysine.<br>
It is preferred that the C-terminal amino acid of the GLP-1 analog portion<br>
discussed herein is fused to the N-terminus of the IgG4 Fc analog portion via a<br>
glycine-rich linker. The in vivo function and stability of the fusion proteins can<br>
be optimized by adding small peptide linkers to prevent potentially unwanted<br>
domain interactions. Further, a glycine-rich linker provides some structural<br>
flexibility such that the GLP-1 analog portion can interact productively with the<br>
GLP-1 receptor on target cells such as the beta cells of the pancreas. These<br>
linkers, however, can significantly increase the risk that the fusion protein will be<br>
immunogenic in vivo. Thus, it is preferred that the length be no longer than<br>
necessary to prevent unwanted domain interactions and/or optimize biological<br>
activity and/or stability. The preferred glycine-rich linker comprises the<br>
sequence: Gly-Gly-GJy-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser<br>
(SEQ ID NO:8). Although more copies of this linker may be used in the fusion<br>
proteins, it is preferred that a single copy of this linker be used to minimize the<br>
risk of immunogenicity associated with prolonged and repeated administration.<br>
Preferred GLP-1-Fc fusions include the following proteins: Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-<br>
GLP-l(7-37)-lL-IgG4 (S228P), Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-lL-IgG4 (S228P, F234A,<br>

(SEQ ID NO: 17). IgG4 refers to an analog of the human IgG4 Fc sequence specified as<br>
SEQ ED NO:7. Substitutions in the lgG4 Fc portion of the fusion protein are indicated in<br>
parenthesis. The wild-type amino acid is specified by its common abbreviation followed<br>
by the position number in the context of the entire IgG4 sequence using the EU<br>
numbering system followed by the amino acid being substituted at that position specified<br>
by its common abbreviation.<br>
The fusion proteins have biological activity. Biological activity refers to the ability cf<br>
the fusion protein to bind to and activate the GLP-1 receptor in vivo and elicit a response.<br>
Responses include, but are not limited to, secretion of insulin, suppression of glucagon,<br>
inhibition of appetite, weight loss, induction of satiety, inhibition of apoptosis, induction of<br>
pancreatic beta cell proliferation, and differentiation of pancreatic beta cells. A<br>
representative number of GLP-1 fusion proteins were tested for in vitro as well as in vivo<br>
activity. In vitro activity based on the ability of the fusion protein to interact with and<br>
activate the human GLP-1 receptor have been shown. (See PCTAJS 04/15595<br>
(WO2005/000892)). HEK293 cells over-expressing the human GLP-1 receptor are used.<br>
Activation of the GLP-1 receptor in these cells causes adenylyl cyclase activation which in<br>
turn induces expression of a reporter gene driven by a cyclic AMP response element (CRE).<br>
The pH of the GLP-1-Fc fusion formulations is adjusted to provide acceptable<br>
stability, to maintain the solubility and insulinotropic activity of the GLP-1-Fc fusion and<br>
be acceptable for parenteral administration. The pH of the GLP-1 -Fc fusion formulations<br>
is preferably adjusted to between about pH 6 and about pH 8.5, preferably between about<br>
-10-<br><br>
pH 6 and about pH 7.5, between about pH 6 and about pH 7, between about pH 6.5 and<br>
about pH 7.5, or between about pH 6 and about pH 6.5, and even more preferably, about<br>
pH 6 or about 6.5.<br>
The formulations comprising a GLP-l-Fc fusion of the present invention may<br>
optionally encompass a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer. However, the selection and<br>
concentration of the buffer shall be such that the formulation can be adjusted to the<br>
described ranges that provide acceptable stability and insulinotropic activity. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable buffers include phosphate buffers like dibasic sodium<br>
phosphate, TRIS, acetate, such as sodium acetate, citrate, such as sodium citrate, sodium<br>
tartarate, basic amino acids such as histidine, lysine or arginine, or neutral amino acids<br>
such as glycine and glycyl-glycine. Other pharmaceutically acceptable buffers are known<br>
in the art. Preferably, the buffer is selected from the group consisting of citrate,<br>
phosphate and TRIS. The skilled artisan will recognize that the selection of the buffer is<br>
dependent upon the described pH ranges and the pKa of the buffer. Preferably, the<br>
concentration of a buffer is between about 1 mM and 30 mM. Even more preferably, the<br>
concentration is between about 4 mM and 14 mM or between about 5 mM and 20 mM.<br>
Even more preferably, the concentration is between about 10 mM and 20 mM. Even<br>
more preferably, the concentration is about 10 mM or about 20 mM.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may optionally encompass a<br>
preservative. However, the selection and concentration of the preservative shall be such<br>
that the formulation can be adjusted to the described ranges that provide acceptable<br>
stability and insulinotropic activity. Preservative refers to a compound that is added to a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation to act as an anti-microbial agent. A parenteral formulation<br>
must meet guidelines for preservative effectiveness to be a commercially viable multi-use<br>
product. Among preservatives known in the art as being effective and acceptable in<br>
parenteral formulations are phenolic preservatives, alkylparabens, benzyl alcohol,<br>
chlorobutanol, resorcinol, and other similar preservatives, and various mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of phenolic derivatives include cresols and phenol or a mixture of cresols and<br>
phenol. Examples of cresols include meta-cresol, ortho-cresol, para-cresol, chloro-cresol,<br>
or mixtures thereof. Alkylparaben refers to a Ci to C4 alkyl paraben, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of alkylparabens include methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, or<br>
butylparaben. The concentration of the preservative is known to one skilled in the art.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The concentrations must be sufficient to maintain preservative effectiveness by retarding<br>
microbial growth.<br>
The preferred preservative is meta-cresol or phenol. In general, the concentration<br>
of meta-cresol is between about 2.0 to about 8.0 mg/mL, about 2.5 mg/mL to about 4.5<br>
mg/mL, and about 2.0 mg/mL to about 4.0 mg/mL. A most preferred concentration of<br>
preservative in the formulation is about 2.7 mg/mL. In another embodiment, the<br>
concentration of phenol is between about 2.0 to about 10.0 mg/mL, and about 4.0 to about<br>
8.0 mg/mL. A most preferred concentration of preservative in the formulation is about<br>
5.0 mg/mL.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may optionally encompass an<br>
isotonicity agent. However, the selection and concentration of the isotonicity agent shall<br>
be such that the formulation can be adjusted to the described ranges that provide<br>
acceptable stability and insulinotropic activity. Isotonicity agents refer to compounds that<br>
are tolerated physiologically and impart a suitable tonicity to the formulation to prevent<br>
the net flow of water across cell membranes. Examples of such compounds include<br>
glycerin (or glycerol), salts, e.g., NaCl, and sugars, e.g., dextrose, mannitol, and sucrose.<br>
These compounds are commonly used for such purposes at known concentrations. One<br>
or more isotonicity agents may be added to adjust the ionic strength or tonicity.<br>
The preferred isotonicity agent is NaCl. The concentration of NaCl is preferably<br>
between about 10 mM and 500 mM, more preferred is between about 50 mM and 200<br>
mM, and most preferred is about 150 mM. In another embodiment, the preferred<br>
isotonicity agent is mannitol. The concentration of the mannitol is preferably between<br>
about 1% (weight (w)/volume (v)) and 10% (w/v), and more preferred is between about<br>
2% (w/v) and 8% (w/v). In another embodiment, the preferred isotonicity agent is<br>
glycerin. The concentration of the glycerin is preferably between about 12 mg/mL and 25<br>
mg/ml, preferably between about 12 mg/mL and 20 mg/ml, and more preferred is about<br>
17 mg/ml.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may optionally encompass a solubility<br>
enhancer. However, the selection and concentration of the solubility enhancer shall be<br>
such that the formulation can be adjusted to the described ranges that provide acceptable<br>
stability and insulinotropic activity. Solubility enhancers provide stability such that the<br>
GLP-l-Fc fusion remains soluble for an extended period of time under the conditions of<br>
-12-<br><br>
storage. Preferably the solubility enhancer is nicotinamide. In general, the concentration<br>
of nicotinamide is between 0.01 and 2 molar. Other preferred ranges of nicotinamide<br>
concentration are: between 0.05 molar and 1.5 molar; between 0.1 molar and 1.0 molar;<br>
between 0.1 molar and 0.5 molar; between 0.5 molar and 1.0 molar; and between 0.15<br>
 molar and 0.25 molar.<br>
Other additives, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizers like Tween<br>
20® (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate), Tween 40® (polyoxyethylene (20)<br>
sorbitan monopalmitate), Tween 80® (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate),<br>
Pluronic F68® (polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers), and PEG<br>
(polyethylene glycol) may optionally be added to the formulation. Preferably the<br>
solubilizer is Tween 20® or TweenSO®. In general, the concentration of Tween 20® or<br>
Tween80® is between 0.001% and 0.05%. Other preferred ranges of Tween 20® or<br>
Tween80® concentrations are: between 0.005% and 0.05%; between 0.0075% and 0.05%;<br>
and between 0.01% and 0.05%.<br>
Administration of the formulations may be via any route known to be effective by the<br>
physician of ordinary skill. Peripheral parenteral is one such method. Parenteral<br>
administration is commonly understood in the medical literature as the injection of a dosage<br>
form into the body by a sterile syringe or some other mechanical device such as an infusion<br>
pump. Peripheral parenteral routes can include intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,<br>
and intraperitoneal routes of administration.<br>
The formulations may also be amenable to administration by oral, rectal, nasal, or<br>
lower respiratory routes, which are non-parenteral routes. Of these non-parenteral routes, the<br>
lower respiratory route and the oral route are preferred.<br>
The formulations comprising a GLP-l-Fc fusion can be used to treat a wide variety of<br>
diseases and conditions. The GLP-l-Fc fusions primarily exert their biological effects by<br>
acting at a receptor referred to as the "GLP-1 receptor." Subjects with diseases and/or<br>
conditions that respond favorably to GLP-1 receptor stimulation or to the administration of<br>
GLP-1 compounds can therefore be treated with the GLP-l-Fc fusions. These subjects are<br>
said to "be in need of treatment with GLP-1 compounds" or "in need of GLP-1 receptor<br>
stimulation". Included are subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes, insulin dependent<br>
diabetes, stroke (see WO 00/16797), myocardial infarction (see WO 98/08531), obesity (see<br>
WO 98/19698), catabolic changes after surgery (see U.S. Patent No. 6,006,753), functional<br>
-13-<br><br>
dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (see WO 99/64060). Also included are subjects<br>
requiring prophylactic treatment with a GLP-1 compound, e.g., subjects at risk for<br>
developing non-insulin dependent diabetes (see WO 00/07617). Subjects with impaired<br>
glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, subjects whose body weight is about 25%<br>
 above normal body weight for the subject's height and body build, subjects with a partial<br>
pancreatectomy, subjects having one or more parents with non-insulin dependent diabetes,<br>
subjects who have had gestational diabetes and subjects who have had acute or chronic<br>
pancreatitis are at risk for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes.<br>
An effective amount of the GLP-1-Fc fusions in the context of the described<br>
 formulations is the quantity which results in a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic<br>
effect without causing unacceptable side-effects when administered to a subject in need of<br>
GLP-1 receptor stimulation. A "desired therapeutic effect" includes one or more of the<br>
following: 1) an amelioration of the symptom(s) associated with the disease or condition;<br>
2) a delay in the onset of symptoms associated with the disease or condition; 3) increased<br>
longevity compared with the absence of the treatment; and 4) greater quality of life<br>
compared with the absence of the treatment. For example, an "effective amount" of a<br>
GLP-l-Fc fusion for the treatment of diabetes is the quantity that would result in greater<br>
control of blood glucose concentration than in the absence of treatment, thereby resulting<br>
in a delay in the onset of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy or<br>
kidney disease. An "effective amount" of a GLP-1-Fc fusion for the prevention of<br>
diabetes is the quantity that would delay, compared with the absence of treatment, the<br>
onset of elevated blood glucose levels that require treatment with anti-hypoglycaemic<br>
drugs such as sulfonyl ureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin and/or bisguanidines.<br>
The dose of fusion protein effective to normalize a patient's blood glucose will<br>
depend on a number of factors, among which are included, without limitation, the subject's<br>
sex, weight and age, the severity of inability to regulate blood glucose, the route of<br>
administration and bioavailability, the pharmacokinetic profile of the fusion protein, the<br>
potency, and the formulation. Doses may be in the range of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg body weight,<br>
preferably in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight.<br>
It is preferable that the fusion proteins be administered either once every two<br>
weeks or once a week. Depending on the disease being treated, it may be necessary to<br>
administer the fusion protein more frequently such as two to three time per week.<br><br>
The present invention will now be described only by way of non-limiting example<br>
with reference to the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In vitro GLP-1 receptor activation assay:<br>
HEK-293 cells expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using a CRE-BLAM<br>
system, are seeded at 20,000 to 40,000 cells/well/100 fxl DMEM medium with 10%FBS<br>
into a poly-d-lysine coated 96 well black, clear-bottom plate. The day after seeding, the<br>
medium is flicked off and 80 jil plasma-free DMEM medium is added. On the third day<br>
after seeding, 20 \l\ of plasma-free DMEM medium with 0.5% BSA containing different<br>
concentrations of various GLP-1 -Fc fusion protein is added to each well to generate a<br>
dose response curve. Generally, fourteen dilutions containing from 3 nanomolar to 30<br>
nanomolar or GLP-1 Fc fusion protein are used to generate a dose response curve from<br>
which EC50 values can be determined. After 5 hours of incubation with the fusion protein,<br>
20 Μ1 of P-lactamase substrate (CCF2/AM, PanVera LLC) is added and incubation<br>
continued for 1 hour at which time fluorescence is determined on a cytofluor. The assay<br>
is further described in Zlokarnik, et al. (1998), Science, 278:84-88.<br>
In vitro GLP-1 receptor activation assay:<br>
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using a CRE-<br>
Luciferase system, are seeded at 30,000 cells/well/80 fil low serum DMEM F12 medium<br>

BSA are mixed and incubated with the cells for 5 hours. Generally 12 dilutions<br>
containing from 3 pM to 3 nM are prepared at a 5X concentration for each test protein<br>
before addition to the cells to generate a dose response curve from which EC50 values are<br>
determined. After incubation, 100 p.1 of Luciferase reagent is added directly to each plate<br>
and mixed gently for 2 minutes. Plates are placed in a Tri-lux luminometer and light<br>
output resulting from luciferase expression is calculated.<br>

Solubility of Glv8-Glu"-GLP-1(7-37)- !L-IgG4 (S228P. F234A. L235A) as a function of<br>
solution pH:<br>
Solubility of Gly8-Glu22-GLP-1(7-37)-lL-IgG4 (S228P, F234A, L235A) as a<br>
function of pH is determined by diluting a stock solution with various buffered solution at<br>
differ pH values, allowing the solution to equilibrate, centrifugating away any<br>
precipitated material, then analyzing the supernant for remaining soluble protein<br>
concentration. Stock protein frozen in PBS, is dialyzed against water at approximately pH<br>
8. After dialysis the protein stock was filtered through a 0.22micron Millex-GV filter and<br>
concentrated to ~12mg/mL using a rinsed Ultrafree centrifugal device (4ml, 5000 dalton<br>
MWCO, at 7000xG). This concentrated solution is diluted 1:1 with 2x stock buffer<br>
solutions (final volume of 50uL in 0.5mL eppendorf tubes) and is allowed to equilibrate<br>
for 15-30 minutes at room temperature. The solution is centrifuged (14,000xG for 5<br>
minutes) to pellet any insoluble material. lOuL of the supernant is removed and<br>
combined with 40uL of the pH 8 water. Two replicates are performed for each sample.<br>
The concentration of soluble GLP-Fc is determined by reversed-phase HPLC against a<br>
standard curve.<br>

The invention provides a stable solution formulation comprising a GLP-1-Fc fusion at a pH between about pH 6 and about pH 8.5 analogs fused to specific IgG4-Fc derivatives. These formulations provide unexpected and considerably greater chemical stability than when compared to GLP-1-Fc fusions at a pH outside the described ranges. The formulations comprising a GLP-1-Fc fusion are useful in treating diabetes, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome and other conditions that would be benefited by lowering plasma glucose, inhibiting gastric and/or intestinal motility and inhibiting gastric and/or intestinal emptying, or inhibiting food intake. <br><br></td>
