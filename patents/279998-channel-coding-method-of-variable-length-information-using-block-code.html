[Invention Title]<br>
CHANNEL CODING METHOD OF VARIABLE LENGTH INFORMATION<br>
USING BLOCK CODE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a coding method for<br>
a mobile communication system, and more particularly to a<br>
method for effectively performing a channel-coding process<br>
on variable length information using a block code.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, some concepts<br>
requisite for the present invention from among several<br>
basic coding theories will hereinafter be described in<br>
detail.<br>
Generally, a general binary error correction code<br>
is denoted by [n, k, d] , where "n" is the number of bits<br>
of coded codewords, "k" is the number of information bits<br>
created prior to the coding process, and "d" is a minimum<br>
distance between codewords. In this case, only the binary<br>
code has been considered for the above-mentioned binary<br>
error correction code, such that a number of possible<br>
codeword points in code space is denoted by 2", and a<br>
total number of coded codewords is denoted by 2". Also,<br>
if the minimum distance is not substantially considered<br>
to be important, the aforementioned binary error<br>
correction code may also be denoted by [n, k] . If there<br>
is no mention of the above error correction code in this<br>
application, it should be noted that individual values of<br>
"n", "k", and "d" be set to the above-mentioned values.<br>
In this case, the above-mentioned error correction<br>
code should not be confused with a matrix-type block code<br>
composed of X number of rows (i.e., X rows) and Y number<br>
of columns (i.e., Y columns).<br>
In the meantime, the coding rate R is defined as a<br>
specific value acquired when the number of information<br>
bits is divided by the number of bits of each codeword.<br>
In other words, the coding rate R is denoted by "k/n",<br>
i.e., R = k/n.<br>
Next, the Hamming distance will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
If two binary codes having the same number of bits<br>
include some bits having different bit values, the above-<br>
mentioned Hamming distance is indicative of the number of<br>
the above bits having the different bit values. Generally,<br>
if the Hamming distance "d" is denoted by d=2a+l, "a"<br>
number of errors can be corrected. For example, if one of<br>
two codewords is 101011 and the other one is 110010, the<br>
Hamming distance between the two codewords is 3.<br>
In the meantime, the term "minimum distance" for<br>
use in the coding theory is indicative of a minimum value<br>
between two arbitrary codewords contained in a code. The<br>
minimum distance is considered to be one of criteria to<br>
evaluate the performance of a code. The longer the<br>
distance between the codewords generated by the coding<br>
process, the lower the probability of misdetecting a<br>
corresponding codeword to be another codeword; as a<br>
result, the coding performance becomes better.<br>
Performance of a total code is estimated by a minimum<br>
distance between codewords having the worst performance.<br>
In conclusion, if a minimum distance of a specific code<br>
is maximized, this specific code may have a superior<br>
performance.<br>
In the next-generation mobile communication system,<br>
control information transmits system constituent<br>
information and transmission channel information, such<br>
that it is considered to be very important information to<br>
determine a system performance. Generally, this control<br>
information has a short length to use a relatively small<br>
amount of system resources. The above-mentioned control<br>
information is coded by the coding technique having very<br>
resistant to a channel error, and is then transmitted. A<br>
variety of coding schemes for the above control<br>
information have been considered in the 3GPP mobile<br>
communication system, for example, a short-length block<br>
code based on a Reed-Muller (RM) code, a tail-biting<br>
convolution code, and a repetition code of a complex code.<br>
In the meantime, the control information for use in<br>
the 3GPP LTE system acting as an improved format of the<br>
above-mentioned mobile communication system is coded by<br>
means of block codes, such that the block-coded control<br>
information is then transmitted. In more detail, if the<br>
length of a transmission (Tx) information bit is "A", the<br>
channel-coding process is performed by a block code<br>
composed of 20 rows and A columns (i.e., (20,A) block<br>
code) during the transmission of a specific channel (e.g..<br>
Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)), and the<br>
channel-coding result is then transmitted. In the 3GPP<br>
LTE system, uplink control information is transmitted<br>
over the PUCCH and a PUSCH (i.e., a physical uplink<br>
shared channel). The control information transmitted over<br>
the PUSCH is channel-coded by a block code composed of 32<br>
rows and A columns (i.e., (32, A) block code), such that<br>
the channel-coded control information is then transmitted.<br>
In the meantime, the (32, A) block code may have<br>
various formats. It is difficult for the user to search<br>
for an optimum format after checking individual coding<br>
performances of the variable-length information bits<br>
associated with all block codes.<br>
iDisclosurel<br>
[Technical Problem!<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
channel coding method of variable-length information using<br>
a block code that substantially obviates one or more<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
effective (32,A) block coding method of variable-length<br>
information. In other words, under the condition that the<br>
length of an information bit is changed in various ways and<br>
the bit length of a coded codeword is also changed in<br>
various ways, the present invention provides the (32,A)<br>
block coding method for effectively supporting the<br>
combination of variable bit lengths.<br>
In the meantime, the number of coded bits may be<br>
equal to or less than 32, and the number of information<br>
bits may be changed in various ways. Therefore, according<br>
to the following embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
present invention provides a method for effectively using<br>
only some necessary parts of all the proposed block codes<br>
associated with the number of specific-length information<br>
bits or the number of specific-length coding bits. On the<br>
contrary, if the coding with a length longer than the above<br>
specific length is needed, the present invention allows the<br>
block code based on the above specific length to be<br>
repeated, such that it performs a long-length coding.<br>

[Advantageous Effects]<br>
According to the above-mentioned embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the present invention reuses a code<br>
generation matrix used for TFCI (Transport Format<br>
Combination Indicator) information coding of a conventional<br>
3GPP system and/or the (20,A) code generation matrix for<br>
PUCCH transmission, such that it can easily implement the<br>
(32,k) block coding. As a result, a minimum- distance<br>
between the generated codewords increases, resulting in an<br>
increased system performance.<br>
[Description of Drawings]<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are included to<br>

invention.<br>

[Best Mode]<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of<br>
which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
Prior to describing the present invention, it should<br>
be noted that most terras disclosed in the present invention<br>
correspond to general terms well known in the art, but some<br>
terms have been selected by the applicant as necessary and<br>
will hereinafter be disclosed in the following description<br>
of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that<br>
the terms defined by the applicant be understood on the<br>
basis of their meanings in the present invention. For<br>
example, although the following description relates to a<br>
detailed example applied to the 3GPP LTE (3rd Generation<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
17<br>
Partnership Project Long Term Evolution) system, the<br>
present invention can also be applied to not only the above<br>
3GPP LTE system but also other arbitrary communication<br>
systems which need to perform the channel coding process on<br>
variable-length control information using the block code.<br>
For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, general structures<br>
and devices well known in the art will be omitted or be<br>
denoted by a block diagram or a flow chart. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
Firstly, items to be commonly considered by the<br>
present invention will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
The [n,k] code is a specific code in which the<br>
number of coding bits is "n" and the number of information<br>
bits is "k".<br>
In this case, if there is no mention in a generation<br>
matrix of each code, this generation matrix is represented<br>
by a basic-sequence-type table. In fact, the coding method<br>
is similar to that of a TFCI code of the 3GPP release 99.<br>
In other words, the information bits are sequentially<br>
allocated to the left-sided basis sequence, and a sequence<br>
corresponding to the product of the basis sequence and the<br>
information bit is added by binary operations (i.e..<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
18<br>
Exclusive OR sum) corresponding to the number of<br>
information bits, such that a coding bit is generated.<br>
If the code is represented according to the above-<br>
mentioned method, although the number of information bits<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "information bit number") is<br>
variable, the present invention has an advantage in that it<br>
can perform the coding process of data on the basis of a<br>
matrix-type basis sequence table. The present invention is<br>
able to support a variety of information bit numbers using<br>
the above-mentioned advantages. Therefore, a basis<br>
sequence table or a code generation matrix is represented<br>
in consideration of a maximum-sized information bit number.<br>
If the maximum number of information bits needed for the<br>
actual application is less than the following proposed size,<br>
it is preferable that a table having no basis sequence for<br>
at least a corresponding maximum bit number (i.e., a<br>
corresponding maximum number of bits) be used.<br>
In the meantime, the operation of replacing a<br>
generation code of "0" with another generation code of "1"<br>
according to the coding theory has no influence on the code<br>
characteristics. Therefore, although the value of "0" is<br>
replaced with the other value of "1" in the basis sequence<br>
table, the replaced result may indicate the same code<br>
feature. Also, although the order of coding bits is<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
19<br>
replaced with another order according to the coding theory,<br>
the replaced result may also indicate the same code feature.<br>
Therefore, although the row location is replaced with<br>
another row location in the basis sequence table, the<br>
replaced result may also indicate the same code feature.<br>
The basis sequence proposed by the following<br>
embodiments is designed to have a variable number of<br>
information bits (i.e., a variable information-bit number),<br>
and is also designed to have a variable number of coding<br>
bits (i.e., a variable coding bit number). Therefore, in<br>
the case of devising the inventive concept of the present<br>
invention, a specific code in which a specific column is<br>
deleted from a specific basis sequence table was pre-<br>
considered. For example, if a basis sequence table is<br>
denoted by a specific format such as (32,14), the (20,11)-<br>
format basis sequence table is one of application examples<br>
of the above (32,14)-format basis sequence table. In more<br>
detail, if 12 columns are successively deleted from the<br>
bottom of the (32,14)-format basis sequence table, and 3<br>
rows are deleted from the right of the (32,14)-format basis<br>
sequence table, the above-mentioned (20,11)- format basis<br>
sequence table can be acquired. In brief, the row and<br>
column of the basis sequence table according to the present<br>
invention have been decided on the basis of the largest<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
20<br>
size. In the case of the small-sized row and column, the<br>
rows and columns of the largest-sized basis sequence table<br>
are sequentially deleted from the right or the bottom of<br>
the above table, such that the deleted result is used.<br>
Needless to say, as previously stated above, although the<br>
row location may be replaced with the column location in<br>
the smaller-sized basis sequence table, or although the<br>
location of "0" is replaced with the other location of "1"<br>
in the basis sequence table, the above replaced results may<br>
have the same codes.<br>
For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, in the case of<br>
indicating the order of any data of the present invention,<br>
the information bits sequentially proceed in the direction<br>
from the left column to the right column in the above basis<br>
sequence table. The coding bits sequentially proceed in<br>
the direction from the uppermost row to the lowermost row<br>
in the above basis sequence table. The term "basis<br>
sequence table" may also be called "Code generation matrix"<br>
or other terms as necessary.<br>
In the meantime, it is preferable that a specific-<br>
pattern basis sequence for use in a specific channel<br>
estimation method be unavailable. In this case, a specific<br>
table, from which a specific basis sequence based on a<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
21<br>
system type is removed, may be selected from various tables<br>
proposed by the following embodiments. From the viewpoint<br>
of the coding process, a corresponding basis sequence may<br>
always be considered to be "0", such that the same coding<br>
performance is made, but only the number of information<br>
bits is reduced.<br>
Therefore, according to the basis sequence table<br>
proposed by the following embodiments, a specific basis<br>
sequence table having no specific basis sequence or a code<br>
generation matrix has already been considered in the case<br>
of designing the present invention.<br>
According to the above-mentioned one aspect of the<br>
present invention, the present invention provides the<br>
(32,A)-format block coding method. In more detail, the<br>
present invention provides the (32,14)-format block coding<br>
method in consideration of the maximum length (i.e., 14<br>
bits) of information bits. However, it should be noted<br>
that only some basis sequences from among the (32,14)-<br>
format code generation matrix be used according to the<br>
information-bit length as previously stated above.<br>
Although a variety of methods can be used for the<br>
above-mentioned purposes, the following embodiments provide<br>
a code design method capable of maintaining a maximum<br>
common point with conventional codes using the conventional<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
22<br>
block codes. In more detail, the conventional codes<br>
provide a first method of using the (32,10)-format block<br>
code for the TFCI-information coding used in the 3GPP<br>
release 99 and a second method of using the (20,14)-format<br>
block code for PUCCH transmission. In this case, the<br>
above-mentioned (20,14)-format block code has been<br>
disclosed in United States Provisional Application No.<br>
51/016,492 used as priority of the present invention,<br>
entitled "GENERATION METHOD OF VARIOUS SHORT LENGTH BLOCK<br>
CODES WITH NESTED STRUCTURE BY PUNCTURING A BASE CODE"<br>
filed by the same applicant as the present invention, which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference. Detailed descriptions<br>
of the (32,10)-foinmat block code and the (20,14)-format<br>
block code will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
The (32,10)-format block code for the TFCI<br>
information coding and the (20,14)-format block code for<br>
PUCCH transmission will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
(32,10) TFCI Block Code and (20,14) Block Code<br>
The (20,14) block code for use in this embodiment<br>
will be generated as follows. Firstly, (20,10) block code<br>
is generated from the (32,10)-structured TFCI code<br>
generation matrix, and 4 basis sequences are added to the<br>
(20,10) block code, such that the (20,14) block code is<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
23<br>
generated.<br>
The (20,10) block code is based on the (32,10)-code<br>
generation matrix used for the channel coding of TFCI<br>
(Transport Format Combination Indicator) information in the<br>
3GPP Rel' 99. As a result, the (20,10) bloc}c code can be<br>
designed to be punctured according to the length of a<br>
codeword to be coded.<br>
The reuse of the (32,10) TFCI information code has a<br>
variety of advantages. For example, the TFCI information<br>
code has been designed on the basis of the Reed-Muller (RM)<br>
code, such that the punctured TFCI code may have a modified<br>
Reed-Muller (RM) code structure. This Reed-Muller (RM) -<br>
based code has an advantage in that it can be quickly<br>
decoded by a fast Hadamard transform method during the<br>
decoding process. For another example, the TFCI coding<br>
method supports a variable-length information bit and a<br>
variable-length coding bit. In this way, the information-<br>
bit length or the coding-bit length can be changed in<br>
various ways, such that requirements for CQI transmission<br>
of the 3GPP LTE can be well satisfied.<br>
The following Table 1 shows the (32,10)-code<br>
generation matrix used for the channel coding of TFCI<br>
information in the 3GPP Rel' 99. In this case, the<br>
(32,10)-code generation matrix generates a specific<br>
24<br>
codeword which has the length of 32 bits and the value of<br>
dniin=12.<br>
[Table 1]<br>
5 Generally, as well known in the art, although the<br>
inter-row location or the inter-column location is replaced<br>
with other locations in the block code, there is no<br>
25<br>
difference in performance between the generated codewords.<br>
The following Table 2 shows a specific block code, which is<br>
equivalent to the (32,10) block code used for the<br>
aforementioned TFCI-information coding using the above-<br>
mentioned advantage.<br>
[Table 2]<br>
As can be seen from the block code shown in Table 2,<br>
the row- and column- locations of the (32,10) code used for<br>
the TFCI coding are changed to other locations, and<br>
locations between some columns (or locations between some<br>
rows on the basis of the TFCI information code) are<br>
exchanged with each other.<br>
In other words, according to this embodiment of the<br>
present invention, 12 rows in either the (32,10)-format<br>
TFCI information code (Table 1) or its equivalent matrix<br>
(Table 2) may be punctured, or 2 0 rows are selected from<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
26<br>
the the (32,10)-format TFCI information code (Table 1) or<br>
its equivalent matrix (Table 2), such that the (20,10)<br>
block code is configured. In this case, from the viewpoint<br>
of the block code of Table 2, 12 columns may be punctured,<br>
and 20 columns may be selected. There is no difference in<br>
mode performance between the first case of using Table 1<br>
and the second case of using Table 2. For the convenience<br>
of description and better understanding of the present<br>
invention, it is assumed that the present invention uses<br>
the equivalent format (See Table 2) of the TFCI information<br>
code if there is no mention in the above-mentioned<br>
description.<br>
In the meantime, the (32,10) code used for coding<br>
the TFCI information has been generated on the basis of the<br>
Reed-Muller (RM) code. In this case, in order to implement<br>
an error correction performance, it is very important for<br>
the above (32,10) code to search for a puncturing pattern<br>
which enables a codeword to have the longest distance (c/^„) .<br>
Compared with this embodiment, an exhaustive search<br>
capable of searching for an optimum puncturing pattern in a<br>
generation matrix of the (32,10) code used for TFCI coding<br>
will hereinafter be described in detail. Provided that the<br>
number of columns of a generation matrix to be punctured in<br>
the (32x10) matrix (also denoted by (32*10) matrix) is set<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
27<br>
to "p", the number of all available puncturing patterns is<br>
denoted by . In this case, is indicative of the<br>
number of cases, each of which selects the p columns from<br>
among 32 columns.<br>
For example, if the value of "p" is 12 (p&gt;=12), there<br>
are different (10x20) generation matrixes (i.e.,<br>
= 225,792,840 number of (10x20) generation matrixes), 10-bit<br>
information (i.e., 2"' = 1,024 number of information segments)<br>
is coded into a codeword of 20 bits. A minimum Hamming<br>
distance ( d^„ ) between codewords generated by individual<br>
matrixes is calculated, such that a generation matrix<br>
having the highest value is found in the above minimum<br>
Hamming distance {d^^). If a puncturing pattern is used to<br>
make the generation matrix having the maximum ( d„„ ] value,<br>
this puncturing pattern is considered to be the last<br>
pattern to be finally found. However, the generation of<br>
the optimum (20,10) block code on the basis of the above<br>
steps requires a large number of calculations, resulting in<br>
greater inconvenience of use.<br>
Therefore, this embodiment of the present invention<br>
adds specific restriction conditions to the process for<br>
deciding the puncturing pattern, such that it reduces the<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
28<br>
range of a searching space for acquiring an optimum ( „„ )<br>
value.<br>
Next, a method for more effectively searching for a<br>
generation matrix of the (20,10) code which generates a<br>
codeword having d^=cl will hereinafter be described in<br>
detail. Provided that a target { rf„, ) value is denoted by d,<br>
the Hamming weight »v(g|(Hj,.ji,[/]) of each row vector<br>
gioty2o[i] (I^'^IO) of the (20,10)-code generation matrix has<br>
some requirements shown in the following Equation 1.<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
f=0,l,--,10<br>
;¦ * 6(There are all ones in this row vector)<br>
For example, if the value of d is 6 (d=5) , Equation<br>
1 can be represented by the following Equation 2.<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
Therefore, if the above restriction of Equation 2 is<br>
added to individual row vectors gioby2o\i] of the (10*20)<br>
matrix generated from the above-mentioned exhaustive search<br>
process, the added result can reduce the number (N« )<br>
of searching spaces capable of searching for a generation<br>
matrix generating a codeword having d^„=6 . Generally,<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
29<br>
based on various cited references, it is well known in the<br>
art that a maximum { d^„ ) value of the (20,10) code is 6,<br>
and its detailed description has been disclosed in "The<br>
Theory of Error-Correcting Codes (by F.J. MacWilliams and<br>
N.J.A. Sloane)". Therefore, the condition of d^=6 is<br>
applied to the condition of Equation 1, such that 360<br>
patterns indicating an optimum performance can be found.<br>
The above 360 puncturing patterns have been<br>
disclosed in Appendix "A" of United States Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/016,492, entitled "GENERATION METHOD OF<br>
VARIOUS SHORT LENGTH BLOCK CODES WITH NESTED STRUCTURE BY<br>
PUNCTURING A BASE CODE" filed by the same applicant as the<br>
present invention. Specifically, indexes of punctured<br>
columns based on Table 2 have been disclosed in the<br>
Appendix "A" . For the convenience of description, the<br>
above-mentioned indexes will herein be omitted.<br>
The following pattern from among the above 360<br>
puncturing patterns will hereinafter be described as an<br>
example.<br>
The following Table 3 shows a specific pattern,<br>
which indicates the distribution of a specific Hamming<br>
weight from among the 360 patterns.<br>
[Table 3]<br>
The puncturing patterns shown in Table 3 correspond<br>
to the sixth index of Table A. 2 of the Appendix "A" of<br>
United States Provisional Application No. 61/015,492. In<br>
this case, the value "0" of Table 3 indicates that a column<br>
corresponding to the location of "0" is punctured. The<br>
value "1" of Table 3 indicates that a column corresponding<br>
to the location of "1" is not punctured but selected for<br>
the (20,10) block code.<br>
In the case where the puncturing pattern of Table 3<br>
is applied to Table 2, the result is shown as the following<br>
Table 4.<br>
[Table 4]<br>
In this case, compared with Table 2, row- and<br>
column- directions of Table 4 are changed, but Table 4 has<br>
the same meaning as Table 2. 12 punctured rows from among<br>
individual row- directional sequences are shown at the<br>
right side of Table 4. As a result, the generated (20,10)<br>
block code can be represented by Table 4.<br>
[Table 5]<br>
In the meantime, there is a little difference<br>
between the order of rows of Table 4 or Table 5 and the<br>
matrix order of the 3GPP-based TFCI coding. As described<br>
above, although the location of each row is changed to<br>
another location according to the above-mentioned coding<br>
theory, there is no difference in performance between<br>
generated codewords. If the row order of Table 4 or Table<br>
5 is adjusted in the same manner as in the TFCI code matrix,<br>
the following Table 6 is acquired.<br>
[Table 6]<br>
As described above, only the row order of Table 6 is<br>
different from that of Table 4, but the remaining features<br>
of Table 6 are exactly equal to those of Table 4. The<br>
representation method of Table 6 has an advantage in that<br>
the last 2-bits be punctured during the puncturing time<br>
from the (20,10) code to the (18,10) code.<br>
Next, a method for extending the above-mentioned<br>
(20,10) code to a maximum of the (20,14) code will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
As for the (20, A) block code according to this<br>
embodiment, it is assumed that a CQl value indicating<br>
channel quality information (CQI) of the 3GPP LTE system be<br>
applied to the channel coding method for PUCCH transmission.<br>
Also, in the case of generating the (20,10) code, the bit<br>
number of the CQI information of the 3GPP LTE system can be<br>
decided in the range from 4 bits to 10 bits, such that it<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
34<br>
can be maximally extended to the (20,10) block code.<br>
However, in the case of the MIMO system, the bit number of<br>
the CQI information may be higher than 10 bits as necessary.<br>
However, a transmission (Tx) amount of actual CQI is<br>
decided according to a CQI generation method. For the<br>
coding process, the present invention may consider a method<br>
for supporting all the information bit numbers ranging from<br>
4 bits to 14 bits.<br>
Therefore, the (20,14) block coding method will<br>
hereinafter be described, which is capable of supporting a<br>
maximum of 14 bits by adding a column corresponding to the<br>
information bit number to the above (20,10) block code.<br>
In order to search for the added column during the<br>
exhaustive search, a large number of calculations must be<br>
carried out. Therefore, the execution of the exhaustive<br>
search in all the cases may be ineffective or undesirable.<br>
In this step, it should be noted that the sixth<br>
column of Table 6 is set to "1" and is used as a basis<br>
sequence. Therefore, if the added column must satisfy the<br>
minimum distance "d", a minimum number of "0" must be equal<br>
to or higher than "d". In this example, the number of "0"<br>
is equal to a minimum distance between codewords. In more<br>
detail, a difference between the added column and the old<br>
sixth column composed of "1" is indicative of a distance<br>
35<br>
between two codewords, such that the number of "0"<br>
contained in the added column is equal to the distance<br>
between codewords.<br>
Generally, a maximum of a minimum distance available<br>
for the (20,10) code is 6. In the present invention, a<br>
minimum of a maximum distance available for the (20,11)<br>
code corresponding to an extended version of the (20,10)<br>
code is 4. In more detail, the maximum-/minimum- distance<br>
characteristics based on various information bit numbers of<br>
the 20-bit codeword can be represented by Table 7.<br>
[Table 7]<br>
Therefore, this embodiment of the present invention<br>
provides a column adding method, which allows the maximum-<br>
/minimum- distance of the added column to be "4" .<br>
According to this column adding method, a column having at<br>
least four "0" values is added to the added column.<br>
In order to minimize the number of searching times,<br>
it is assumed that the added column of this embodiment<br>
includes 4 number of "0" values (i.e., four "0" values).<br>
In this way, if the added column includes the four "O"<br>
values and 16 number of "1" values, this added column can<br>
be configured in various ways. A representative example of<br>
36<br>
the added column is shovm in the following Table 8. If the<br>
(20,10) code of Table 6 is extended to the (20,14) code.<br>
Table 8 can be acquired.<br>
[Table 8]<br>
With reference to Table 8, the four added columns<br>
are indicative of four columns located at the right side.<br>
In each added column, "0" is denoted by a bold line.<br>
Based on the above-mentioned facts, a method for<br>
modifying or optimizing Table 8 will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
According to this embodiment, the sixth column of<br>
Table 8, i.e., all bits of the column Mj.,5, is set to "1",<br>
such that the sixth column is considered to be a basis<br>
sequence. This basis sequence greatly contributes to all<br>
codewords of a corresponding bit. Therefore, from the<br>
viewpoint of the corresponding bit, the use of the basis<br>
sequence having many weights may be desirable.<br>
However, several bits in all codewords are<br>
exclusive-OR (XOR) operated, such that their combination<br>
result must be considered. Thus, in order to reduce the<br>
number of the combination cases, the basis sequence in<br>
which each of all bits has the value of "1" moves to the<br>
frontmost column, resulting in the increase of a<br>
contribution rate. In this way, if data is coded under a<br>
small number of bits {i.e., a small bit number), the<br>
present invention may consider the above method for moving<br>
the basis sequence in which each of all bits is "1" to the<br>
frontmost column, and the moved result is represented by<br>
the following Table 9.<br>
[Table 9]<br>
with reference to Table 9, a sixth sequence (i.e.,<br>
each bit of the sixth sequence has the value of "1") from<br>
among the original column- directional basis secjuence moves<br>
to the location of a first basis sequence, and the order of<br>
other sequences is not changed to another order.<br>
In the following description, it is assumed that the<br>
(20,14) block code structure for PUCCH transmission uses<br>
the block code of Table 9. If the number of information<br>
bits for PUCCH transmission is limited to a maximum of 13<br>
bits or less, the basis sequence located at the rightmost<br>
part of Table 9 may be omitted as necessary, and the<br>
omitted result can be represented by the following Table 10.<br>
[Table 10]<br>
Next, based on the above-mentioned description, a<br>
method for generating the (n,)c) block code (where n^32 and<br>
k^l4) will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
(n, k) BLOCK CODE (n
A block code having a maximum size of (32,14) will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail. In other words,<br>
according to this embodiment, a maximum size of the coding<br>
bit number is 32, and a maximum size of the information bit<br>
number is 14. The coding design can be implemented in<br>
various ways, but a coding method according to this<br>
embodiment must be designed to search for a maximum number<br>
of common points with conventional codes.<br>
In order to generate the (32,14) block code, the<br>
present invention considers the (20,14) block code {See<br>
Table 9) acquired from the (32,10) TFCI block code of the<br>
3GPP Release 99, and at the same time considers the above-<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
40<br>
mentioned (32,10) TFCI block code. In order to generate<br>
the (32,14) block code using the (20,14) block code and the<br>
(32,10) TFCI block code, a »TBD" (To be defined) part of<br>
FIG. 1 needs to be additionally defined.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for generating the (32,14) block code using the<br>
(32,10) block code used for a conventional TFCI<br>
information coding and the (20,14) code used for PUCCH<br>
transmission according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, if the (32,10) block code 101<br>
used for the TFCI information coding and the (20,14)<br>
block code 102 are used to generate the (32,14) block<br>
code 104, the TBD part 103 must be additionally defined.<br>
In one aspect of any one of block codes, the above-<br>
mentioned definition can be analyzed in various ways.<br>
Namely, the (32,14) block code 104 according to this<br>
embodiment is generated when four basis sequences<br>
(corresponding to the combination part between the 102a<br>
part and the 103 part of FIG. 1) is added to the right<br>
side of the conventional (32,10) block code. In another<br>
aspect of the above block codes, 12 row-directional<br>
sequences (corresponding to the combination part between<br>
the 101a part and the 103 part of FIG. 1) are added to<br>
either the block code of Table 9 or its equivalent<br>
41<br>
(20,14) block code 102, such that the (32,14) block code<br>
104 may also be generated.<br>
In this case, the conventional TFCI information<br>
code shown in Table 1 and its equivalent code can also be<br>
used as the (32,10) block code 101. The block code of<br>
Table 9 and its equivalent code can also be used as the<br>
(20,14) block code 102. In this case, if the inter-row<br>
location and/or the inter-column location of the<br>
conventional block code are/is changed to others, the<br>
above equivalent code is made.<br>
Preferably, if the code is designed, the designed<br>
code must allow the TBD 103 to have the best performance<br>
at a minimum distance. Generally, according to various<br>
information-bit lengths and various coding-bit lengths,<br>
the following minimum-distance performances are acquired<br>
as shown in Table 11.<br>
[Table 11)<br>
With reference to Table 11, in the case of the<br>
(32,A) block coding, if "A" is higher than "10", a<br>
maximum value of a minimum Hamming distance of the basis<br>
sequence is limited to "10".<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
42<br>
Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the TBD part 103 of FIG. 1 along<br>
with the 102a part of the (20,14) block code 102 must<br>
allow a maximum value of the minimum Hamming distance of<br>
each basis sequence (corresponding to the combination<br>
part between the 102a part and the 103 part of FIG. 1) to<br>
be "10". In this case, the 102a part corresponds to the<br>
information bits of more than 10 bits. In more detail, if<br>
the number of additional basis sequences is 1 or 2 (i.e.,<br>
if if "A" is 11 or 12), this means that one or two basis<br>
sequences are added to allow a minimum Hamming distance<br>
of each basis sequence to be "10". If the number of<br>
additional basis sequences is 3 or 4 (i.e., if "A" is 13<br>
or 14), this means that three or four basis sequences are<br>
added to allow a minimum Hamming distance of each basis<br>
sequence to be "8". The (32,10) block code for TFCI<br>
information coding includes a basis sequence in which<br>
each of all components is "1", such that each of the<br>
additional basis sequences may include 10 number of "0"<br>
values. In other words, if the (20,14) block code is used<br>
as the block code of Table 9, individual basis sequences<br>
corresponding to the 102a part of FIG. 1 include 4 number<br>
of "0" values, such that the basis sequence part<br>
43<br>
corresponding to the TBD part may include 6 number of "0"<br>
values.<br>
An example for satisfying the above-mentioned<br>
condition is shown in the following Table 12.<br>
[Table 12]<br>
As can be seen from Table 12, if 12 rows from the<br>
bottom of Table 12 are deleted, the (20,14) code for<br>
PUCCH transmission is formed. If 14 rows from the bottom<br>
of Table 12 are deleted, the (18,14) code is formed.<br>
Variable application of the information bit can be easily<br>
implemented, and as many basis sequences of Table 12 as<br>
the number of corresponding information bits are acquired<br>
from Table 12, such that the acquired basis sequences are<br>
used for the coding process. If a maximum number of<br>
information bits (i.e., a maximum information-bit number)<br>
of FIG. 12 is less than 14 (i.e., 14 bits), basis<br>
sequences as many as the predetermined number unnecessary<br>
for the basis-sequence table such as Table 9 may be<br>
deleted from the right column. This means that basis<br>
sequences as many as the number of information bits<br>
required for the (32,10) block code may be added.<br>
For example, provided that a maximum information-<br>
bit number is limited to 11 bits, the following (32,11)<br>
block code of Table 13 can be used.<br>
[Table 13]<br>
In the meantime, a method for arranging the (32,k)<br>
block code in consideration of the (16,k) block code will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
A method for generating an optimum code of the<br>
(32, k) block code of Table 12 or Table 13 is as follows.<br>
In the case of generating the (20,k) or (18,k) block code,<br>
if the remaining rows from the lowest row are deleted,<br>
the above optimum code of the (32, k) block code can be<br>
generated. However, if the (16,k) block code is needed,<br>
much consideration is needed. Therefore, according to<br>
this embodiment of the present invention, the row order<br>
of the above (32, k) block code is changed in<br>
consideration of the (16, k) block code. If the (16,k)<br>
block code is needed, although some rows from the lowest<br>
row of the (32, k) block code are deleted and used, the<br>
46<br>
present invention is able to generate a necessary code. A<br>
representative example is shown in the following Table 14.<br>
[Table 14]<br>
In Table 14, during the code conversion from the<br>
(32, k) code to the (20, k) code, if 12 rows are deleted<br>
from Table 14 on the basis of the lowest row, an optimum<br>
code is generated. If 14 rows are deleted from Table 14<br>
on the basis of the lowest row, the (18, k) code is<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR20O8/007576<br>
47<br>
generated. If 16 rows are deleted from Table 14 on the<br>
basis of the lowest row, the (16,k) code is generated.<br>
In the meantime, based on the above-mentioned<br>
description, if a codeword of more than 32 bits is needed,<br>
the following channel coding method can be carried out.<br>
IF CODEWORD OF MORE THAN 32 BITS IS NEEDED:<br>
If the codeword of more than 32 bits is needed, the<br>
present invention provides a method for generating the<br>
long-length (n,k) code by repeating the above basis<br>
sequence on the basis of the (32, k) or (20, k) code used<br>
as a base code.<br>
The (32,k) or (20,k) code can be easily generated<br>
on the basis of Table 12 or Table 14. In the meantime, in<br>
order to assign a stronger or higher error correction<br>
capability to a transmission (Tx) bit, the present<br>
invention may increase the number of coding bits (i.e.,<br>
the coding bit number) . In this case, it is preferable<br>
that a new code corresponding to the increased number of<br>
coding bits be generated, but it is very difficult for a<br>
code designer to design a new code whenever the number of<br>
coding bits increases. Therefore, one of simple<br>
generation methods is to repeat the base code by a<br>
desired length. If the desired length is not accurately<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
48<br>
represented by an integer multiple of the base code, the<br>
base code is repeated by at least the desired length, and<br>
as many base codes as the number of excessive bits may be<br>
removed. In this case, although the present invention is<br>
able to search for an optimum puncturing pattern every<br>
time, the present invention can substantially consider a<br>
simple puncturing method based on a rate matching block.<br>
In this case, the present invention may consider<br>
the (32, k) or (20, k) code as the base code. For the<br>
convenience of description, the present invention<br>
considers only a specific case in which a desired length<br>
has the size of an integer multiple of the base code. In<br>
the remaining cases, it is assumed that the present<br>
invention is able to acquire a necessary code using the<br>
puncturing method. Also, the present invention is able to<br>
use a variety of "k" values. In this case, for the<br>
convenience of description, it is assumed that a maximum<br>
size of 'k" is set to 14. Although there is no mention of<br>
the smaller size of less than 14 in the present invention,<br>
it is well known to those skilled in the art that a basis<br>
sequence corresponding to a corresponding length be<br>
selected and used.<br>
For example, if the (64,14) code is needed, the<br>
(32,14) code can be repeated only two times. If the<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
49<br>
(40,14) code is needed, the (20,14) code can be repeated<br>
only two times. Also, the (32,14) code and the (20,14)<br>
code are simultaneously considered as the base code, such<br>
that the (32,14) code and the (20,14) code are<br>
sequentially attached to configure the (52,14) code.<br>
In conclusion, the combination of available codes<br>
may be determined to be the {a*32+b*20,14) code (where '*a"<br>
or "b" is an integer number of at least "0".<br>
If the last necessary coding bit number is not<br>
denoted by an integer multiple of the base code, the base<br>
code is repeated to be longer than the desired length,<br>
unnecessary parts may be severed from the end part of the<br>
longer-sized code or may be punctured using the rate<br>
matching blocks.<br>
In the meantime, according to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, after the order of information bits<br>
has been reversed, the base code may then be repeated.<br>
As described above, if the base code is<br>
continuously repeated, minimum-distance characteristics<br>
of the base code are maintained without any change, such<br>
that the resultant minimum-distance characteristics are<br>
repeated. Therefore, if the code having an original<br>
minimum distance of 4 is repeated two times, the minimum<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
50<br>
distance is increased by two times, such that the minimum<br>
distance of the resultant code reaches "8".<br>
However, provided that any variation is applied to<br>
the information bit during the above repetition, although<br>
the information bit which forms a codeword having a<br>
minimum distance is used, a codeword generated by another<br>
information bit changed by the above repetition is able<br>
to form another codeword having the distance longer than<br>
the above-mentioned minimum distance. If the minimum<br>
distance is not repeated according to the above-mentioned<br>
principles, a code can be designed such that the minimum-<br>
distance characteristics can be larger than those of a<br>
simple multiple.<br>
The present invention can consider a variety of<br>
methods for changing the information bit. For example, in<br>
order to change the above-mentioned information bit, a<br>
method for using a reverse version of a bit unit, and a<br>
method for allowing the information bit to pass through a<br>
random sequence such as a PN sequence can be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
Also, the present invention may assign different<br>
information-bit variations to individual repetition times,<br>
such that the information bit is differently changed<br>
whenever the repetition occurs. However, in this case.<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
51<br>
the complexity of a transmission/reception end increases.<br>
If the repetition is performed several times, the present<br>
invention may not change the information bit in the first<br>
time, and may change the information bit in the next time.<br>
In more detail, in the case of repeating the code<br>
according to this embodiment, the information bit is not<br>
changed at the even-th repetition, but is changed at the<br>
odd-th repetition. In other words, the present invention<br>
controls the information-bit variation to be toggled<br>
whenever the repetition occurs.<br>
For example, under the condition that the (20,k)<br>
code and the (32, k) code are used as the base codes, the<br>
(40, k) code, the (52, k) code, and the (64, k) code can be<br>
generated according to the present invention. A detailed<br>
description thereof will hereinafter be described.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating minimum-distance<br>
performances acquired when the (40,k) block code, the<br>
(52,k) block code, and the (64,k) block code are<br>
generated on the condition that the (20,k) block code and<br>
the (32, k) block code are used as base codes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, " (40,k)_20+20" indicates that<br>
the (2 0, k) code acting as the base code is repeated two<br>
times. "(20,k)_20rev" indicates that the information bit is<br>
reversed from the (2 0, k) code acting as the base code.<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KI12008/007576<br>
52<br>
" (32, k)_32rev" can be analyzed in the same method as the<br>
above-mentioned method.<br>
"(40,k)_20+20rev" indicates that the (20,k) code<br>
used as the base code was repeated two times, an<br>
information bit was changed according to the toggle method<br>
at the first repetition time, and the information bit was<br>
then reversed at the second repetition time. In this way,<br>
" (64, k)_32+32rev" can also be analyzed in the same method<br>
as the above. In the meantime, "(52,k)_20+32rev" indicates<br>
that the (32, k) and (20, k) codes were selected as base<br>
codes, each of the selected base codes was repeated only<br>
once, and the (32,k) code acting as the second base code<br>
was bit-reversed and the information bit was then applied<br>
to the bit-reverse result.<br>
In FIG. 2, if the value of k is denoted by k^4, the<br>
"(40,k)_20" code has a low performance less than that of<br>
the (32, k) code. Therefore, it can be recognized that the<br>
operation of using the (3 2,k) code with less number of<br>
coding bits has a good performance higher than that of the<br>
operation of repeating the (20, k) code two times. In other<br>
words, the repetition of (32, k) code with less number of<br>
coding bits has a high performance superior to that of the<br>
repetition of (20,k) code. Therefore, the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention provides a method for<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
53<br>
repeatedly using the (32,k) code during the coding process<br>
for a long-length coding bit. In other words, according to<br>
this embodiment of the present invention, provided that the<br>
(32,k) code was selected as the base code, the bit number<br>
(i.e., the number of bits) of the last output sequence was<br>
equal to or higher than 32 (i.e., 32 bits), and an integer<br>
multiple of the base code was not implemented, the (3 2, k)<br>
code is repeated to be longer than a desired length, and<br>
unnecessary parts (i.e., corresponding to the bit number of<br>
the needed output sequence) are severed from the end of the<br>
repeated result.<br>
The above-mentioned embodiment can be analyzed as<br>
follows. In more detail, if the length of the needed<br>
output sequence is at least 32 bits, it can be recognized<br>
that the coded result of the (32,k) block code was<br>
cyclically repeated to acquire the above output sequence.<br>
Namely, provided that the 32-bit-length codeword, which has<br>
been channel-coded by the (32,k) block code, is represented<br>
by /bo,A|,(!'2.^3'--&gt;^B-i (where B=32) , and the output sequence<br>
longer than the length of 32 bits (e.g., the bit length of<br>
"Q") is represented by <jo the following></jo>
relationship between the output sequence and the channel-<br>
coded 32-bit-length codeword can be represented by the<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
54<br>
following Equation 3.<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
9/=^((modfi) where i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 0-1<br>
As can be seen from Equation 3, the output sequence<br>
component having the index "i" corresponds to a codeword<br>
component which has an index corresponding to the modulo-<br>
operation result value. In this case, the modulo-operation<br>
result value is acquired when the index "i" was modulo-<br>
operated with the "B" value of 32. If the Q value is<br>
higher than 32, the output sequence is acquired when the<br>
channel-coded sequence was cyclically repeated. This also<br>
means that the (32, k) code was repeated a predetermined<br>
number of times and the part corresponding to the length of<br>
a necessary codeword was selected and used. As well known<br>
to those skilled in the art, the above-mentioned operation<br>
results have been substantially equal to each other, but<br>
they have been analyzed in different ways.<br>
In the meantime, as can be seen from FIG. 2, the<br>
performance of the " (52,k)_20+32rev" code is equal to or<br>
higher than that of the " (52, k)_20+32" code, and the<br>
performance of the (40, k)_20+20rev" code is equal to or<br>
higher than that of " (40,k)_20+20". Therefore, in order to<br>
improve the minimum-distance characteristics, the<br>
wo 2009/082147 PCT/KR2008/007576<br>
55<br>
information bit is repeated without any change at the first<br>
repetition time, and is then reversed at the next<br>
repetition time.<br>
Finally, if the last information bit number is not<br>
denoted by an integer multiple of the base code, the base<br>
code is repeated to be longer than a desired length, and<br>
unnecessary parts can be severed from the end part of the<br>
repeated result, or can be punctured by the rate matching<br>
block method.<br>
In the meantime, the above-mentioned method for<br>
performing the bit reversion of the information bit<br>
according to the toggle scheme can also be applied to not<br>
only the repetition of the above-mentioned base code but<br>
also other repetitions of various base codes. For example,<br>
when the repetitive coding of the simplex code of ACK/NACK<br>
control information is performed, the information bit is<br>
coded without any change at the first repetition time, and<br>
the bit-reversion information bit of the ACK/NACK control<br>
information is then coded at the second repetition time.<br>
It should be noted that most terminology disclosed<br>
in the present invention is defined in consideration of<br>
functions of the present invention, and can be differently<br>
determined according to intention of those skilled in the<br>
