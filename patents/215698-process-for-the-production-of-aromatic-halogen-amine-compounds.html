				<td>Process For the Production of aromatic halogen amino Compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrogenation process for the production of aromatic halo-gen-amino compounds. Production is effected by means of catalytic hydrogenation of the cor¬responding aromatic halonitro compounds in the presence of a modified noble metal catalyst and a vanadium compound. The invention also relates to catalyst systems consisting of a mo¬dified noble metal catalyst and a vanadium compound, as well as the use thereof in the hydro¬genation of aromatic halonitro compounds.<br>
It is known that aromatic nitro compounds may be reduced to aromatic amines in very good yields in the presence of noble metal catalysts and hydrogen. When further hydrogenatable groups are present simultaneously, for example halogen substituents (halonitro aromatic sub¬stances), special measures are necessary to prevent the formation of undesired by-products, which otherwise can often only be separated from the desired product at great expense or, in particularly unfavourable cases, not at all. What is particularly difficult is selective reduction, if several hydrogenatable groups are present in a compound.<br>
Catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding aromatic amines takes place via several intermediate steps. The corresponding nitroso compounds, and in par¬ticular the hydroxylamine intermediate step, are important. In practice, the formation of hydro-xylamines is a special problem, since it can accumulate in large quantities in the reaction solu¬tion under certain conditions. This applies in particular to aromatic nitro compounds, the hydro¬genation of which yields relatively stable arylhydroxylamines. This is especially critical if hydro¬genation is carried out in a slurry-batch reactor. In extreme cases, several tons of arylhydro-xylamine may be formed in the interim.<br>
In US-A-4 020 107, phosphorous acid, hypophosphorous acid or derivatives thereof are pro¬posed as an additive in the hydrogenation of nitro-aromatic substances, which are substituted by halogen on the aromatic substance, using Pt or Pd on activated carbon and hydrogen. These systems are selective towards the halogen substituents present in the molecule. How¬ever, they have too little reactivity, which in many cases leads to the formation of considerable quantities of undesired arylhydroxylamines [J. R. Kosak, in Catalysis of Organic Reactions, Vol 18, (1988), 135-147); idem, in Catalysis in Organic Synthesis, 1980,107-117].<br><br>
The accumulation of arylhydroxylamines is undesired for the following reasons. On the one hand, it is known that such compounds are thermally unstable, and upon heating with or without H2 may disproportionate whilst giving off heat. Further decomposition reactions may be initiated by the heat being released, and these then may consequently give rise to occurrences of severe explosions. W.R. Tong et al, AICHE Loss Prev. 1977, (11), 71-75 describe such an occurrence during the reduction of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene to 3,4-dichloroaniline.<br>
In addition, arylhydroxylamines are known as strong carcinogens and represent a certain po¬tential danger. Larger quantities formed have to be disposed of at great expense.<br>
A third range of problems is the production of the desired pure aromatic amine. If, during hy-drogenation or at the end of the reaction, significant quantities of arylhydroxylamine are pre¬sent, this may lead to condensation, thus forming undesired, dyed azo or azoxy products or higher molecular weight, deeply dyed condensation products. Since the quantity of arylhydro¬xylamine may change from batch to batch, the product quality obtained varies in purity and appearance. Thus, complicated purifying operations are necessary, with corresponding losses in yield and problems relating to disposal of the residue.<br>
The above-mentioned problems are intensified in such a way that the concentrations occurring or even the maximum possible concentrations of this hydroxylamine intermediate step cannot be predicted even in the case of known processes which have been studied thoroughly. The presence of traces of impurities may unpredictably initiate the spontaneous accumulation of hydroxylamine intermediate steps. For example, J.R. Kosak, in Catalysis of Organic Reactions, Vol. 18, (1988), 135, describes that the simple addition of 1% NaNO3 increases accumulation during hydrogenation of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene from an original 
It has now surprisingly been found that the catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic halonitro com¬pounds is effected with very high selectivity, with high yields and short reaction times, if rho¬dium, iruthenium, ridium, platinum or palladium catalysts, which are modified with inorganic or organic phosphorus compounds with a degree of oxidation of less than 5, are used in the pre¬sence of a vanadium compound.<br>
Surprisingly, in many cases, only small concentrations of hydroxylamine occur. Normally, the hydroxylamine concentrations observed during the entire reaction are less than 1%. In this way, it is possible to use higher concentrations or quantities of halonitro aromatic substances, which contributes towards providing an extremely economical process without endangering the<br><br>
required safety measures. In addition, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst systems is high.<br>
The catalyst systems may be easily produced for example from well known, commercially available standard noble metal catalysts, for example standard Pt, Pd or Ir hydrogenation cata¬lysts, so that a constant quality of catalyst is assured, which is of importance for large-scale production.<br>
Frequently, in hydrogenation, a lower pressure (ca. 5 bar) and a comparatively low tempe¬rature (ca. 100°) may even be used.<br>
A further advantage of the process also over known reduction methods, such as Bechamp re¬duction or sulphide reduction, is that only small quantities of product residues are obtained, which have to be disposed of. The product is obtained in high purity, since practically no azo or azoxy compounds result, and the reaction may be carried out in a highly economic manner in current reactors without having to resort to special safety measures. Hydrogenation, especially the latter phase, is quick. The outcome of this is considerable advantages as regards' constant quality.<br>
The subject matter of the invention is a process for the production of aromatic halogen-amino compounds by means of catalytic hydrogenation of corresponding aromatic halonitro com¬pounds on noble metal catalysts, characterised in that hydrogenation is carried out in the pre¬sence of a rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, platinum or palladium catalyst, which is modified with an inorganic or organic phosphorus compound with a degree of oxidation of less than 5, and in the presence of a vanadium compound.<br>
Preferably, the noble metal catalyst employed is a platinum or iridium catalyst, most preferably a platinum catalyst.<br>
The noble metal catalyst is preferably employed in a quantity of 0.1 to 10% by weight, most preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the aromatic halonitro compound employed.<br>
It is preferable to use a noble metal catalyst which contains 1 to 10% by weight platinum. The platinum employed may be applied to a carrier as platinum black, platinum oxide or preferably in metallised or oxidised form. Especially good carriers are activated carbon, silicon dioxide in<br><br>
the form of silicic acid or silica gel, aluminium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium sulphate, barium sulphate, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide or iron oxide, most prefe¬rably activated carbon, aluminium oxide or silicon dioxide. Platinum applied to the above-men¬tioned carrier material is available commercially, or may be produced by methods which are familiar to a person skilled in the art, as disclosed for example in DE-OS 2 042 368.<br>
Phosphorus compounds as modifiers may be in principle any inorganic or organic phosphorus compounds, in which the phosphorus has a degree of oxidation of less than 5. Examples are most preferably phosphorous acid and derivatives of phosphorous acid, as named for example inUS-A4020 107.<br>
Examples of further phosphorus compounds that are suitable according to the invention are phosphines P(Ra)3-n(H)n, phosphites P(ORa)3, phosphinous acids HO-P(H)m(Ra)2.m , phosphine<br>
oxides O=P(Ra)3.n(H)n , hypophosphonous acids(Formula Removed) P—H , P—Ra , hypophosphorous acids<br>
O=P(OH)(H)m(Ra)2-m and phosphorous acids O=P(OH)2H or O=P(OH)2Ra, wherein Ra signifies linear or branched C1-C12-alkyl or C6-C16-aryl, m is 0, 1 or 2, and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3, as well as the salts, esters and amides of the acids.<br>
Examples of C1-C12-alkyl are methyl, ethyl, the various isomers of propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl and dodecyl.<br>
C6-C16-aryl may be unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, tetralin, indene, azuline or biphenyl.<br>
Ra is preferably C1-C6-alkyl or unsubstituted phenyl, or phenyl substituted by C1-C6-alkyl or d-C6-alkoxy.<br>
The phosphorus compounds, where they are acids, may exist as free acids, salts, esters or amides.<br>
Preference is given to diphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine, phosphinous acid and its salts, amides and esters, diphenylphosphinic acid, diphenylphosphite, phosphine oxides, phospho-<br><br>
rous acid and its salts or esters, as well as hypophosphorous acid and its salts, amides and esters.<br>
Especially preferred are phosphorous acid and its salts, amides and esters, as well as hypo-phosphorous acid and its salts, amides and esters.<br>
The salts which may be mentioned are preferably those with cations from the group of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, or the ammonium cation. Preferred alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are Li, Na, K, Ca or Mg.<br>
The ammonium cation may be NH/, (C1-C6-alkyl)4N+ or an ammonium cation substituted with a mixture of H and C1-C6-alkyl.<br>
Examples of C1-C6-alkyI are methyl, ethyl, the various isomers of propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl.<br>
Modification of the noble metal catalysts may basically take place during or following the preparation process for the hydrogenation catalyst. However, it is preferably undertaken prior to adding the catalyst to the reaction mixture, or it is effected directly in the reaction mixture, for example whereby a phosphorus compound is added separately in either dissolved or dis¬persed form, and both are stirred together with the solution to be hydrogenated. It is also pos¬sible to set the pH value of the catalyst mixture to a certain value during modification, by ad¬ding acids or bases. It is similarly possible to first of all modify the noble metal catalyst with the phosphorus compound by mixing both together as solids, or by dissolving the phosphorus compound in a solvent and suspending the noble metal catalyst in the solution, and subse¬quently filtering. The modified catalyst may be stored and added to the solution to be hydro¬genated as required.<br>
Modification of the noble metal catalyst with the phosphorus compound is preferably effected prior to catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
The phosphorus compound may be dissolved or dispersed in the reaction medium to be hydro¬genated.<br>
The ratio of noble metal in the noble metal catalyst to the modifying phosphorus compound is preferably 1 : 0.1 to 1 :1000, most preferably 1 :1 to 1 :100 molar parts.<br><br>
Vanadium compounds in terms of this invention are elementary vanadium or vanadium com¬pounds in which the vanadium has a degree of oxidation of 0, II, III, IV or V.<br>
The vanadium compounds may be dissolved or dispersed in the reaction medium in catalytic quantities.<br>
Another variant of the process is obtained if the vanadium compound is mixed with the noble metal catalyst or applied to it. The noble metal catalyst may already be modified with the phos¬phorus compound or may be modified only afterwards. In principle, the vanadium compound may also be applied to the hydrogenation catalyst in the course of the preparation process of the hydrogen catalyst, before or after it is modified with a phosphorus compound.<br>
One preferred variant is for the vanadium compound to be firstly applied to a suitable carrier material, and then dispersed in the reaction medium in this form together with the modified noble metal catalyst. Suitable carrier materials are for example all carrier materials that are used for the production of commercial powdered hydrogenation catalysts, as mentioned above. Activated carbon is especially suitable.<br>
The vanadium compound is applied to the catalyst or the carrier material in a simple manner, for example by dissolving it, suspending the catalyst or the carrier material in the solution, and subsequently filtering.<br>
If desired, while the vanadium compound is being applied, the pH value of the suspension may be set at the desired value by adding acids or bases.<br>
If the vanadium compounds are not soluble in the reaction medium, they may also be mixed in dispersed, suspended form with the suspended catalyst, and filtered off together.<br>
The vanadium compounds with the degree of oxidation 0, II, III, IV or V may be elementary va¬nadium and also purely inorganic compounds, however organic complexes with for example oxalate or acetyl acetonate are also possible.<br>
Preference is given to vanadium compounds, such as V2O5, V2O4, vanadium(lll)acetyl ace¬tonate, vanadium(IV)oxyacetyl acetonate or those which represent the purely inorganic salt, oxo salt, or the hydrate of a purely inorganic salt or oxo salt. Examples are VOCIs, VCIe" , [VO(SCN)4 ]2", VOSO4, NH4VO3, VCI3, VOCI, VCI2 or the corresponding halides with F or Br.<br><br>
Depending on the pH value, the compounds may be present in aqueous solution in various hy¬drate forms.<br>
The vanadates with a degree of oxidation V, or the hydrates of these vanadates, as well as va-nadium(lll) acetyl acetonate, vanadium(IV)oxyacetyl acetonate are especially preferred, and vanadium(lll) acetyl acetonate, vanadium(IV)oxyacetyl acetonate are preferred in particular.<br>
Of the vanadates, ammonium, Li, Na or K vanadates, or the hydrates of these vanadates are preferred.<br>
The molar ratio of noble metal in the noble metal catalyst to vanadium compound is preferably 1 : 0.1 to 1 :1000, most preferably 1 :1 to 1 : 50.<br>

The present invention relates to process for the production of aromatic halogen-amino compounds by means of catalytic hydrogenation on noble metal catalysts of corresponding aromatic halonitro compounds, characterized in that hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, platinum or palladium catalyst which is modified with an inorganic or organic phosphorus compound having an oxidation state of less than 5, or organic phosphorus compound of formulae O=P(Ra)3, O=P(OH)(Ra)2, and O=P(OH)2Ra, wherein Ra is linear or branched C1-C12alkyl, C6-C16aryl or C4-C16 heteroaryl, and in the presence of a vanadium compound having a degree of oxidation of 0, II, III, IV or V, where by the molar ratio of noble metal in the noble metal catalyst to vanadium compound is  from 1: 0.1 to 1:1000,  said process is carried out at a pressure of 1 to 100 bar and  at a temperature of 0°C to +160°C,' with  the proviso  that the optional substituents of the aromatic halonitro compounds contain no carbon/carbon and carbon/hetero atom multiple bonds.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example Ai: Impregnation of activated carbon with ammonium vanadate 300 mg of ammonium vanadate and 600 ml of deionised water are placed in an agitator ves¬sel. Afterwards, 20 g of activated carbon are added and stirred for 30 minutes. The impreg¬nated activated carbon is subsequently filtered off and washed in portions with 600 ml of de-ionised water. Finally, the vanadium-containing carbon is dried in a vacuum drying chamber at 60°C until reaching a constant weight. 18.8 g of modified carbon with a vanadium content of 13.6 mg/g are obtained.<br>
Example B1:   Preparation of para-chloraniline<br>
48 g of p-chloronitrobenzene and 20 mg of a vanadium-containing activated carbon produced according to example A1 are mixed in an agitator autoclave.<br>
300 mg of Pt-carbon catalyst (1% platinum on activated carbon carrier) and 50 ml of methanol are placed in a separate glass container, and 3 ml of an aqueous stock solution containing 825 mg of hypophosphorous acid (content 50%) are added dropwise whilst stirring. After stirring for 15 minutes, the catalyst suspension is flushed into the autoclave with an additional 50 ml of methanol. Hydrogenation takes place at 80°C and 40 bar hydrogen pressure. The reaction is complete after ca. 1 hour. After 50% of the theoretical hydrogen has reacted, a sample is ta¬ken. In thin-layer chromatography, less than 1% of the hydroxylamine stage is detected. After cooling and rendering the autoclave inert with argon, the catalyst is filtered off and washed with a little methanol. After evaporating the solvent and subsequently drying, 37.6 g of p-chlo-roaniline (crude yield 99.6% of theory) are obtained.<br>
