				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of controlling a wind power installation for carrying out the method.<br>
Wind power installations using more modem technology have long been known. Such wind power installations have rotors comprising at least one or more rotor blades. The rotors and accordingly the rotor blades carried thereby of wind power installations are subjected to a particular degree to the ambient environmental influences such as for example rain, snow, hail or also insects. In particular the leading edges of the rotor blades are heavily loaded in that respect. In that situation it can happen that the rotor blades and in particular the leading edges thereof, after some time, suffer from (mechanical) damage, for which cost-intensive repair is necessary, especially as a crane is frequently required for that purpose and the entire wind power installation is also stopped for a prolonged period due to the repair and under some circumstances even individual rotor blades have to be transported away to the repair location.<br>
Such damage is to be attributed to erosion which damage the surface-the so-called gel coat-of the rotor blades, which as the counterpart results in a worsening of the aerodynamic properties of the blades.<br>
The object of the present invention is to reduce the erosion damage at the rotor blades and to avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of controlling a wind power installation having at least one sensor for providing a particle measurement value by detecting the number, the speed or the impulse of<br><br>
particles which impinge on the at least one sensor, with a data processing and control device for processing the measurement data detected by the at least one sensor, wherein the rotary speed of the rotor of the wind power installation is reduced by means of the data processing and control device or the rotor of the wind power installation is stopped if said particle measurement value measured by the at least oi&gt;e sensor exceeds a predetermined value, wherein the at least one sensor is arranged on the outside of the rotor of the wind power installation.<br>
The present invention also provides a wind power installing for carrying out the method as herein above described wherein; at least one sensor for providing a particle measurement value by detecting the number, the energy or the impulse of particles which impinge on the at least one sensor, wherein the at least one sensor is connected to a data processing and the control device for processing measurement data detected by the at least one sensor and for reducing the rotary speed of the rotor of the wind power installation or for stopping the rotor of the wind power installation if a particle measurement value measured by the at least one sensor exceeds a predetermined value, wherein the at least one sensor is arranged on the outside of the rotor of the wind power installation.<br>
The strength of the influence of weather conditions such as rain, snow, hail or also insects on  the rotor blade leading edge is substantially<br><br>
dependent on the rotary speed of/the wind power installation. The faster the blades are rotating, the correspondingly higher is the speed of the rotor blade tip and the correspondingly greater is the impingement speed of particles such as for example raindrops, hailstones, snowflakes, insects or even grains of dust - referred to hereinafter generally as particles - against the rotor blade.<br>
Wind power installations in accordance with the state of the art are generally operated with given operating characteristics, irrespective of the weather. In the case of installations with a variable rotary speed - such as for example the wind power installations from Enercon of type E-40 or E-66 et al - that signifies for example a given installation-typical rotary speed-power characteristic.<br>
In the case of the wind power installations nowadays - of the above-mentioned type - of the order of magnitude of between 500 kW and 1.5 MW, the maximum blade tip speeds are in the range of 65 - 75 m/s or corresponding to 234 - 270 kph.<br>
The invention is based on the realisation that the greatest erosion damage is caused at the rotor blade leading edge by particles which impact against the rotor blade leading edge.<br>
In accordance with the invention it is now proposed that a wind power installation be equipped with one or more sensors which can detect the respective (wind-independent) weather conditions and give corresponding signals to the wind power installation control system which suitably reacts thereto by reducing the rotary speed of the rotor of the installation for example in heavy rain - that is to say with a high number of particles within a predetermined unit of time (for example within a minute).<br>
The method according to the invention and the wind power installation according to the invention make it possible to avoid or drastically reduce weather-induced erosion damage to the wind power installation. That in turn results in a reduction in expensive rotor blade repairs and in addition the fact of keeping the surfaces of the rotor blades intact can afford a uniform level of efficiency of the wind power installation.<br><br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter by means of an embodiment.<br>
The Figure is a diagrammatic view showing a wind power installation 3 having a rotor 4 which comprises three rotor blades 5. Mounted on the rotor blade hub 4 and/or at the rotor blades 5 (the leading edge) are sensors 1, 2 which measure there the incidence against the sensor of particles which are borne on the wind to the wind power installation. The sensor or sensors are connected to a data processing device 6 (PC) of the wind power installation, which evaluates the measured data and sets for example a suitable amount/time ratio, that is to say, detects the number of particles over a given period of time. If more than a predetermined number of particles, for example 10 - 20 particles (raindrops) impinge on a sensor within a given unit of time, for example 5 - 10 seconds, the rotary speed of the wind power installation is reduced by means of a program stored in the data processing device. That admittedly also results in a reduction in the total power which the wind power installation produces. As however the rainy times are usually relatively short in comparison with the periods which are free from precipitation, that is scarcely significant and it is possible to provide for effective protection for the rotor blades if the rotary speed thereof is reduced, for example halved, during the precipitation periods.<br>
It will be appreciated that the data processing device also processes as usual the measured wind data which are measured with other sensors and causes a reduction in the rotary speed of the rotor only when the wind speed exceeds a predetermined value.<br>
It is also possible by means of the data processing device to effect measurement of the particle amount, particle speed and/or particle impulses (the so-called precipitation energy), that is to say the precipitation power (amount of precipitation (particles), speed of the precipitation) can be detected (integrated) over a given period of time and the reduction in the rotary speed is initiated when the precipitation energy or precipitation power exceeds a predetermined value.<br><br>
It is also possible by means d"f the sensors to measure an addition or integration of the impulses (mass of a particle multiplied by the impingement speed of the particle).<br>
If the impulses caused by particles exceed a predetermined value in respect of their magnitude, a reduction in rotary speed is automatically effected so that this also automatically results in a reduction in the impulse forces on the rotor blades, caused by the precipitations.<br><br><br>
