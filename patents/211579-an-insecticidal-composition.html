ORGANOPHOSPHOROUS COMPOSITIONS<br>
Pesticides; especially organophosphate insecticides, have come under increased scrutiny.  Specifically, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) mandates that the EPA reassess all pesticide tolerances and exemptions from tolerances by 2006. There is a need for insecticidal compositions which are more ef¬ficacious or which retain their efficacy at lower doses.<br>
As discussed in U.S. 5,326,560 to Henderson, the art has attemp¬ted to manage the problem of insecticide toxicity in the environ¬ment through careful selection and application of herbicides and pesticides. As described therein, ideal application of insectici-des to crops might involve applying minimal quantities of insec¬ticides which maintain effectiveness over a longer period of time. Many insecticides currently available, such as pyrethrum, the pyrethroids, organophosphates, and biologicals, rapidly de¬grade after exposure to ultraviolet radiation and/or through hy¬drolysis and oxidation. Unfortunately, these active ingredients may degrade well before they have accomplished their purpose. To address these problems, Henderson discloses an insecticide carrier that is a mixture of petrolatum (preferably white petro¬latum) , diatomaceous earth, and preferably a diluent, such as "crop oil." Henderson reports that low rates of the insecticidal toxicant (a bacterial insecticide) are more effective when used in combination with the proper carrier/adjuvant, It should be considered, however, that increased persistence of pesticidal re¬sidues may not be advantageous in all cases because, for example, they might be ingested by the consumer of the produce.<br>
JP 58-172304 discloses an ant control agent comprising organo-phosphorus insecticides plus anionic and nonionic surfactants which is applied to wood surfaces. The anionic surfactant is pre- ferably dodecylbenzene calcium sulfonate. The non-ionic surfactant is polyoxyethylene alkylphenol-ether. The ant control agent reportedly permeates the wood and adheres to the wood surface better than the prior art materials.<br>
JP 9-268108A discloses a low dose organophosphorus compound (e.g., acephate), non™ionic and/or anionic surfactants and a so¬lid carrier having a specified degree of whiteness. The working examples in JP 9-268108A teach the use of non-ionic or anionic surfactants. Both types of surfactants in one formulation are not taught.<br><br>
At col. 8, lines 45-47, U.S. 5,108,488 teaches that when the herbicidal composition described therein is to be used as a pre-emergent treatment for weed control. A fertilizer, an insecti¬cide, a fungicide, or another herbicide may be included in the formulation.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,399,542 is also directed to herbicidal composi¬tions which may further contain an adjuvant, including a mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons, alkyl esters and acids, anionic surfactants and inert materials, e.g,, DASH® adjuvant available from BASF Corporation,<br>
U.S. Patents No. 4,966,728 and 5,084,087 describe adjuvants that are useful for herbicide formulations <br>
Organophosphorus compounds, such as organophosphates, are anti¬cholinesterase chemicals which damage or destroy cholinesterase, the enzyme required for nerve function in the living body. Various alkoxy groups (X) are often attached to the phosphorus as follows:<br><br>
The term "necessary effective dose", as used herein, means the dose at which a desired pesticidal activity is achieved.<br>
The term "effective", as used herein, means the typical amount, dosage or concentration or percentage of an active ingredient necessary to achieve a desired result.<br>
The term "carrier", as used herein, means an inert material added to a technical toxicant to facilitate later dilution to field strength.<br>
The term "diluent", as used herein, means a material, liquid or solid, serving to dilute the technical toxicant to field strength for adequate plant coverage, maximum effectiveness and economy.<br>
The term "HLB", as used herein, means hydrophilic/lipophilic ba¬lance. For example, emulsifiers typically involve a molecule that combines hydrophilic and lipophilic groups. The hydrophilic/lipo¬philic balance (HLB) is a major factor in determining the emulsi-fication characteristics of a non-ionic surfactant. Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic, while surfactants with<br><br>
higher HLB values are more hydrophilic These HLB values assist formulators by reducing the number of surfactants to be evaluated for a given application. In general, surfactant function falls within specific HLB ranges, noted below:<br><br>
In the present application, all percentages are weight percent unless otherwise indicated.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide more effica¬cious organophosphorus insecticidal compositions containing an organophosphorus insecticide, an adjuvant and, optionally, a di¬luent.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide organo¬phosphorus insecticidal compositions that demonstrate substan¬tially equivalent efficacy at reduced application rates.<br>
In accordance with these objects, it has been discovered that blending an organophosphorus insecticidal composition with a cer¬tain class of adjuvant enables the use of lower levels of said insecticide while maintaining the active ingredient's effective¬ness.  Also, such blending improves the efficacy of certain orga¬nophosphorus insecticides at equivalent application rates.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment the present invention is an insecticidal composition composed of from 0,015% to 3.6% of one or more organophosphate insecticidal compounds; from 0,5% to 99.5% of an adjuvant composition comprising, based on the weight of the adjuvant:<br>
(a)	from 20 to 90 weight percent of a C1-C6-alkanol ester of a fatty acid containing from 4-22 carbon atoms;<br>
(b)	from 4 to 40 weight percent of an anionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of partial sulfate and phosphate esters and carboxylates of monohydroxyfunctional polyoxy-alkylene ethers;<br>
(c)	from 2 to 20 weight percent of a long chain carboxylic acid containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms; and<br>
(d)	optionally, a hydrocarbon;<br>
and diluent.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the insecticidal composition is composed of  0,5% - 99.5% of an adjuvant composition comprising, based on the weight of the adjuvant:<br>
(a)	from 30 to 80 percent of a C1-C6-alkanol ester of a fatty acid containing from 10 to 20 carbon atoms;<br>
(b)	from 4 to 20 percent of an anionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of the partial sulfate and phosphate esters and carboxylates of monohydroxyl-functional polyoxy-alkylene ethers having an average molecular weight of from 600 to 1200 Daltons; and<br>
(c)	from 4 to 6 percent of a long chain carboxylic acid having from 10 to about 20 carbon atoms;<br>
0,015% to 3.6% of one or more organophosphate insecticidal compound; and diluent.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an insecticidal composition composed of 0.5% - 99,5% of an adjuvant composition comprising, based on the weight of the adjuvant:<br>
(a)	from 2 to 30 percent of an anionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of the partial sulfate and phosphate esters and carboxylates of monohydroxyl-functional polyoxy-alkylene ethers and their alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts;<br>
(b)	one of the following fatty acid components;<br>
(i) from 1 to 20 percent of a fatty acid having from 10 to 22<br>
carbon atoms; and (ii) from 10 to 96 percent of a C1-C6-alkanol ester of a fatty<br>
acid having form 10 to 22 carbon atoms; and<br>
(c)	a hydrocarbon component with is<br>
(i) from 90 to 10 percent when the fatty acid component is<br>
(b) (i); and (ii) up to about 70 percent when the fatty acid component is<br>
(b) (ii);<br>
0,015% - 3.6% of one or more organophospate insecticidal compounds; and diluent.<br>
Another aspect of the present inventon is a method for controlling insect populations in crops.  The method involves applying to said crop an eff ective amount of one of the insecti* cidal compositions described above.  It is method is especially<br><br>
efficacious when used to control insect populations or the lepidopteran order.<br>

The preferred organophosphorus insecticides are chlorpyrifos, parathion, ethylmethyl parathion, methyl parathion, dimethoate, azinphosmethyl, acephate, diazinon, malathion, ethion, and fono-fos.  The more preferred of these organophosphorus compounds are chlorpyrifos, parathion, ethyl-methyl parathion, methyl para¬thion, dimethoate, azinphosmethyl, acephate, diazinon and mala¬thion.  Especially chlorpyrifos, oxydementon-methyl, dimethoate, methyl parathion, azinphpsmethyl, parathion, ethyl-methyl para -thion and certain combinations of these.<br>
Particulary preferred are compositions containing only one orga¬nophosphorus compound selected from the group methyl parathion, oxydementon-methyl, dimethoate, acephate, dicrotophos and azino-phosmethyl, and optionally a second compound selected from the group of the aforementioned preferred organophosphorus insectici¬des.<br>
The concentration of insecticidal compound in the insecticidal composition of the present invention will depend on the specific insecticide used and the specific adjuvant composition.  Gene¬rally, the insecticidal compound will be present at from 0.015 % to 3.6 % of the composition as applied to the substrate, e.g., the plant.  More preferably, the insecticidal compound will be present at from 0.015% to 1.8% of the composition as applied to the substrate.<br>
Adjuvant compositions useful in the practice of the present in¬vention include those based on methylated seed oils such as des¬cribed in US Patents No, 4,834,908; 5,102,442 and 5,238,604, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for<br><br>
the adjuvants described therein. Representative preferred adjuvants are described in U.S. Patent No, 4,834,908 as a mixture of:<br>
(a)	an anionic surfactant derived from esterification of a poly-oxyalkylene nonionic surfactant with a dihydric or trihydric inorganic acid or by carboxylation with an organic acid derivative;<br>
(b)	(i) a long chain carboxylic acid and/or (ii) lower alkanol ester thereof; and	.   '" "<br>
(c)	a hydrocarbon.<br>
The anionic surfactants of (a) are preferably the partial sulfate and phosphate esters of polyoxyalkylene ethers. These partial esteers are prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example, by reacting on of the well known and commer¬cially available monohydric polyoxyalkylene ethers with sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid or their chemical equivalents. The sul¬fate esters so obtained consist predominantly of the half ester (monoester) while the phosphate esters generally contain both mono- and diesters. Also useful, are the carboxylate surfactants, as are also the simple salts of these surfactants, for example the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts, parti¬cularly the latter- The preferred nonionic, monofunctional ethers used to prepare the esters are available commercially. The pre¬ferred ethers have molecular weights of from 400 to 3000 Daltons, more preferably, from 600 to 1200 Dal tons. An exemplary anionic surfactant is KLEARFAC® AA-270, a phosphate ester product of BASF Corporation, Mt. Olive, NJ, USA.<br>
The long chain carboxylic acid component (b) (i) may have a chain length of from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Preferably, the carboxylic acid component is selected from the group of naturally occurring fatty aids such as stearic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid and the like and mixtures thereof. The unsaturated fatty acids are preferred.  The long chain carboxylic acid ester component (b) (ii) may be considered as derived from a lower alkanol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol or butyl alcohol and a long chain carboxylic acid.  The methyl and ethyl esters are preferred. Most particularly, the methyl esters are utilized.  The long chain carboxylic acid generally contains from 10-22 carbon atoms, preferably from 14-18 carbon atoms.  Preferred are those carboxylic acids obtainable form natural sources such as fats and oils, for example, lauric, myristic, stearic, linoleic, linole-<br><br>
nic, palmiciic and oleic acids.  Mixtures of these acids ars also useful.  Preferred are methyl esters of oleic and palmitic acids,<br>
The hydrocarbon component (c) may be derived principally from vegetable or petroleun sources.  Hydrocarbon components derived from petroleum sources may be predominately aliphatic or aro¬matic.  Preferred are the aromatic solvents particularly those containing alkylated benzenes and naphthalenes.<br>
The adjuvants generally contain, in percent by weight relative to the total weight of the adjuvant, from 2- to 30 percent anionic surfactant (a) ; from 1 to 20 percent fatty acid (b) (i) or from 10 to 96  percent lower alkanol ester (b) (ii); and from 90 to 10 percent hydrocarbon component (c).  More preferably, the adjuvant contains from 2 to 10 percent anionic surfactant '(a)%  from 4 to 10 percent farry acid (b) (i) or form 10 to 50 percenz lower alkanol ester (b) (ii); and from S8 to 40 percent hydrocarbon component (c).  The hydrocarbon component is optional when the (b) component is a fatty acid ester.<br><br><br>
(d) 35% Aromatic 150 solvent (mixed aromatic solvent) (available from Exxon Chemical Corporation).<br>
The final concentration of adjuvant applied will depend upon the specific application (crop, pest, etc.) as well as the activity of the insecticide but it will typically be in the range of  0.5 to 99,5%. Preferably, the amount of adjuvant will be 0.25% to 7% of the spray mix. More preferably, the amount of adjuvant will be 0,25% to 4.0% of the spray mix. Most preferably, the amount of adjuvant will be 0.25 to 1,0% of the spray mix. It is contempla¬ted that the adjuvant can make up as high as 99% of the applied mixture when a highly concentrated insecticidal compound is used, such as in ultra low volume application in which the adjuvant and carrier may be one and the same.<br>
The adjuvant is typically applied at a rate of from 0,5 1/ha to 2 1/ha, with the preferred rate being about 1 1/ha.<br>

An untreated plot for comparison of aphid control.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As demonstrated by the above data, cotton aphid control by methyl parathion and a tank mix of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate at rates below the recommended maximum rate for aphid control was much higher when tank-mixed with the adjuvant than when applied alone, at the application rates tested.  Improvement in aphid control was observed by tank-mixing oxydemeton-methyl, dimethoate and blends of dimethoate with chlorpyrifos at the full rate with the adjuvant.  These results indicate that the use of the adjuvant in combination with certain organophosphate insecticides increases the efficacy of control of these insecticides against cotton aphid, even at less than the maximum recommended application rate, as compared to the same insecticides- alone.<br>
Example 2 - Control of Whiteflies<br>
Test plot areas were monitored for the presence of significant naturally occurring populations of the target pest(s).  At the critical pest population threshold, treatments were applied to crops using a CO2 pressurized backpack sprayer.

One plot (E) was left untreated as a control.  Each test plot consisted of a 10-ft long row of crop and each treatment was replicated four ti¬mes in a randomized complete block design.  A natural infestation of whitefly adults was counted 1 and 3 days after treatment by searching 10 leaves per each treatment plot.  To determine con¬trol over immatures, 3 plants were shaken so that adults flew away.  The shaken plants were then covered with a bag.  At 7 days after treatment, the plants were cut down and frozen.  The adults inside the bags were brushed onto a petri dish and counted.  The whitefly counts are presented in Table 3.<br>
Treatments F - I were applied to green beans at the 3-4th leaf growth stage with the sprayer calibrated to deliver 340 1/ha at 275 kPa pressure through 12 SX hollow cone nozzles.

The ratio of the insecticides and the water resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0*16%.<br><br><br>
E,	Acephate Plus Adjuvant:<br>
A mixture as in I was prepared, except that the adjuvant DASH® . was added to the insecticide mix at a rate of 2,35 1 ai/ha. With the 340 1 of water used to deliver the mix the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0,69%,<br>

A mixture of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate were used at a rate of 0,28 and 0,225 kg ai/ha, respectively, for a total of 0,5 kg ai/ha. The tankmix rate of 0.5 kg ai represents half of the mini¬mum labeled rate for whitefly control for each active ingre¬dients. The insecticide mixture was combined with water at a rate of 340 1 of water/ha for delivery in the field* The ratio of the insecticides and the water resulted in an insecticide concentra¬tion of 0,15%,<br>

A mixture as in G was prepared, except that the adjuvant DASH® was added to the insecticide mix at a rate of 2,35 1 ai/ha. With the 340 1 of water used to deliver the mix the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0,59%*<br>
I. Acephate:<br>
Acephate (Orthene® 90 S) was applied at a rate of 1.12 kg of active ingredient (ai) per hectare (ha). The 1.12 kg ai rate of acephate represents the full (maximum) recommended rate for whi¬tefly control. The insecticide was combined with water at a rate of 340 1 of water/ha for delivery in the field. The ratio of the insecticides and the water resulted in an insecticide concentra¬tion of 0,33%,<br>
J.Control:<br>
An untreated plot for comparison.<br><br><br><br>
These data show that the addition of the adjuvant to tankmixes of chlorpyrifos +dimethoate at the minimum labeled rate or half the minimum labeled rate for whitefly control resulted in better knockdown and residual control of bandedwinged whitefly as compa¬red to the insecticide tankmix at the same rates alone. Further¬more, the above insecticides plus Dash had comparable control to acephate at the full rate, but were weaker than acephate when applied alone. These results indicate that the use of Dash can result in a reduction of the rates needed for effective whitefly control by the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and di-methoate.<br>

The adjuvant DASH® was mixed with the 138 1 of water used to, de¬liver the mix resulted in an adjuvant concentration of 1,67%,<br><br><br><br>
Example 5 -  Control of Colorado Potato Beetle<br>
» The efficacy of Guthion™ (azinphosmethyl) alone and in combina¬tion with Dash HC® against the Colorado Potato Beetle (Leptino-tarsa decemlineata) on potatoes.<br>
The test plot area was monitored for the presence of significant naturally occurring populations of the target pest, Colorado potato beetle (CPB), At the critical pest population threshold, treatments were applied to 6 meter, single row plots of the crop using a CO2 pressurized backpack sprayer.<br>
Treatments were sprayed on potatoes in the early bloom stage to a mature population of the Colorado potato beetle. Larvae were evaluated in two classes: class one = first and second instar larvae, class two = third and fourth instar. Population counts were taken at 3 and 7 days after treatment. Trial results can be seen in Table 8.<br>
A. Untreated Control<br>
An untreated plot for comparison of beetle control.<br>
B. Azinphosmethyl at full rate per acre<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate of 0.42 kg ai/ha. The recom¬mended rate for CPB control. The insecticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 1/ha. This resulted in an insecticide con¬centration of 0,07%,<br>
C.	Azinphosmethyl at 20% reduced rate<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate of 0.335 kg ai/ha. This is a 20% reduction below the recommended rate for CPB control. The in¬secticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 1/ha.  This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0.056%.<br>
D,	Azinphosmethyl at Vz  full rate<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate of 0,21 kg al/ha. This is Vz of the recommended label rate for CPB control. The insecticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 1/ha, This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0,035%.<br><br>
E• Azinphosmethyl at full rate plus adjuvant<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate-of 0,42 kg ai/ha. The recom¬mended rate for CPB control* The insecticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 l/ha. This resulted in an insecticide con¬centration of 0,07% With the 600 1 of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0,383%,<br>
F,	Azinphosmethyl at 20% reduced rate plus adjuvant<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate of 0.335 kg al/ha. This is a 20% reduction below the recommended rate for CPB control. The in¬secticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 l/ha. This re¬sulted in an insecticide concentration of 0.056%, With the 600 l/ha of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0.383%.<br>
G.	Azinphosmethyl at Vz  full rate plus adjuvant<br>
Azinphosmethyl was applied at a rate of 0.21 kg ai/ha. This is V: of the recommended label rate for CPB control. The insecticide was combined with water at a rate of 600 l/ha. This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0,035%. With the 600 1 of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0,383%,<br><br><br><br>
As demonstrated by the above data, in 12 possible paired compari¬sons between insecticide performance with and without the adjuvant, the insecticide/adjuvant combination performed better in 8 comparisons (57% of the time). Equivalent in one comparison (8%)/ and worse than the insecticide alone in 3 comparisons (25%).<br>
Example 6 - Control of Cabbage Pests<br>
The efficacy of chlorpyrifos plus Dash® adjuvant against the cab¬bage pests:  cabbage looper (Trichoplasia ni), diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), and imported cabbageworm (Pieris rapae) is assessed in this example.<br><br><br>
D,	Chlorpyrifos at V2 label rate<br>
Chlorpyrifos was applied at a rate of 0.7 kg ai/ha, a 50% reduction of the recommended label rate. The insecticide was com¬bined with water at 403 1/ha. This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0,173%.<br>
E,	Chlorpyrifos at full rate plus adjuvant<br>
Chlorpyrifos was applied at a rate of 1,4 kg ai/ha, the recommen¬ded label rate. The insecticide was combined with water at 403 1/ha. This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0.35%. With the 403 1 of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0.26%,<br>
F,	Chlorpyrifos at 80% label rate plus adjuvant<br>
Chlorpyrifos was applied at a rate of 1.12 kg ai/ha, a 20% reduction of the recommended label rate* The insecticide was com¬bined with water at 403 1/ha, This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0*28%, With the 403 1 of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0.26%.<br>
G,	Chlorpyrifos at Vz  label rate plus adjuvant<br>
Chlorpyrifos was applied at a rate of 0,7 kg ai/ha, a 50% reduction of the recommended label rate. The insecticide was com¬bined with water at 403 1/ha. This resulted in an insecticide concentration of 0*173%* With the 403 1 of water used to deliver the mix, the resultant adjuvant concentration was 0.26%.<br><br><br><br>
Example 7 - Airblast Application<br>
An air blast sprayer utilizes a fan or pump to create a high speed air stream that transports and deposits pesticide solutions in orchard and vine crops to control sucking pests in tree fruits such as aphids, scale crawlers, lygus bug, pear psylla, peach twig borer and leafhoppers.<br>
The addition of the adjuvant DASH improves the performance of chlorpyrifos by enhancing coverage on both target pests and foliage. The organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos is applied at a rate of, 0.3 g ai/1 of water/ha, DASH adjuvant is included at" the rate of 5 ml .per liter. The rate range of chlorpyrifos is from 0,3-0 .6 g ai/1.<br>
Treatments are applied with conventional air blast spray rigs to control sucking pests. This method is representative of a commer¬cial ground application of crop protection products utilized in tree fruits.<br>
Example 8 - Aerial Application of Organophospate Insecticide<br>
The organophosphate insecticide profenofos (CuracronTM) is aerially applied at 1.12 kg ai/ha in combination with DASH adjuvant at 2*3 1/ha. The insecticide is combined with water at 11-38 liter. The volume of water/ha is determined by crop growth stage and application equipment. The concentration of active in¬gredient rate of profenofos when sprayed at the above water volu¬mes would be 1,2-4.0%. The addition of adjuvant improves the per¬formance of profenofos by enhancing coverage on both target pests and foliage. The concentration of the adjuvant Dash when sprayed at the above water volumes would be 2.4-8-0%.<br>
Treatments are aerially applied to control lepidopterous pests such as armyworms and Helicoverpa spp. This application method is representative of commercial aerial applications of crop protection products utilized in cotton.<br>
Example 9 - Ultra Low Volume Aerial Application<br>
Area-wide control of migratory locusts in Northern Africa and the Middle East, as well as control of mosquitoes, which vector mala¬ria, yellow fever, and other tropical diseases, requires wides¬pread ultra low volume (ULV) aerial sprays of less than one gal¬lon per acre.  In such applications, the adjuvant is combined with malathion, chlorpyrifos, or another insecticide, with no<br><br>
additional water, other carriers, or additives. Malathion is used at a rate of 0.56 kg ai/ha and is mixed with DASH adjuvant with no additional water, other carriers or additives. The adjuvant-malathion mix is applied at a volume of 9.4 1/ha, and is delivered in the field using an aerial ULV sprayer. The concen¬tration of malathion and adjuvant is 6% for malathion and 94% for adjuvant.<br>
This type of ULV application is common in the tropics where the area to be treated is extensive, and the ground is rugged. The addition of DASH improves the performance of malathion (and other insecticides) by enhancing coverage on both target pests and the surfaces on which they alight.<br><br><br><br>
