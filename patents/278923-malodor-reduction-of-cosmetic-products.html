MALODOR REDUCTION OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS<br>
The present invention is directed to a skin care composition and a method for reducing malodor in skin care compositions. More particularly, the invention is directed to skin 5 care compositions comprising an insoluble particle that is suitable to adsorb compounds that have been proven to yield offensively unpleasant odors in compositions, like lotions, creams and body washes. The insoluble particle is preferably used with the adsorbable solvent suitable to be adsorbed on to the insoluble particles whereby compositions that contain an insoluble particle and the adsorbable solvent surprisingly show a reduction in<br>
10 malodor, and especially, a reduction in malodor originating from compounds suitable to, for example, hydrogen bond to the insoluble particle and/or be scavenged by the adsorbable solvent which is part of an adsorbable solvent-insoluble particle complex. Furthermore the compositions of the present invention, which comprise an adsorbable solvent-insoluble particle complex, unexpectedly show a reduction in malodor that is<br>
15 greater than the sum of malodor reduction for compositions that only contain insoluble particle and only contain adsorbable solvent.<br>
A wide variety of skin care compositions tend to generate malodors after coming into contact with air, bacteria, skin or combinations of the same for prolonged periods of time. 20     In fact many skin care compositions comprise actives that, for example, oxidize, thereby generating volatile components that result in malodor.<br>
Attempts at reducing malodor in skin care compositions have been made. For example, fragrances have been used in skin care compositions to mask malodors. Use of 25 fragrances, however, is not always desirable since many consumers wish to use skin care compositions that are free of fragrances due to various skin sensitivities and allergies. Also, fragrances within a product tend to have a shorter life than the product itself. Therefore malodor masking may not be achieved during an entire product life.<br>
30 There is increasing interest to develop skin care compositions that are free of malodor, and especially, skin care compositions that are free of malodor and that are suitable to yield the characteristic benefit they are known to produce. This invention is directed to a skin care composition comprising insoluble particles and preferably an adsorbable solvent.   The skin care compositions made according to this invention are surprisingly<br>
35     free of malodor originating from compounds that, for example, are suitable to hydrogen<br>

Skin, as used herein, is meant to include all skin on the face and body. Skin care composition is meant to mean a composition that may be applied to skin and/or hair as a leave on and/or rinse off composition. Such a skin care composition is not limited with respect to the form it takes and therefore can be, for example, a bar, liquid, gel, stick, roll-<br>
15 on formulation, cream, aerosol or non-aerosol spray, fabric (e.g. non-woven textile) -applied formulation, mousse, lotion, ointment, cosmetic, cosmetic remover, foundation, conditioner or shampoo. The skin care composition is not limited in use and can, for example, lighten, moisturize, clean, nourish, or reduce wrinkles or oil on skin as well as clean, condition or be used to sculpt hair.<br>
20<br>
Ingredients that can degrade to yield a component with malodor, as used herein, is meant to mean any ingredient that is often used in a topical composition like those that provide a benefit to hair or skin when, for example, being topically applied. Component with a malodor is meant to include, for example, heterocompounds like low molecular weight<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is no limitation with respect to the ingredient (that can degrade to yield a component with malodor) that may be used in this invention as long the ingredient is one that can be applied to skin and/or hair and provide a benefit.<br>
20<br>
Illustrative and non-limiting examples of the type of ingredients (including active ingredients) that can degrade to yield a component with malodor and that may be used in this invention include unsaturated fatty acids, and especially, polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic, eicosapolyenoic, docosapolyenoic and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).   CLA<br>
25 can comprise a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid in which various configurations of cis and trans double bonds at positions (6,8), (7,9), (8,10), (9,11), (10,12), (11,13), or mixtures thereof are possible. Therefore, many individual isomers and combinations of isomers may be used as the active ingredient (that yields malodor) in this invention.<br>
30<br>
A preferred CLA suitable for use in the compositions made in accordance with the present invention is the cis 9, trans 11 (hereinafter referred to as c9, t11) isomer. This particular isomer of the free acid has the structure shown below:<br>
 <br>
WO 2008/101852	PCT/EP2008/051778<br>
-5-<br>
 <br>
The invention also includes for use as actives derivatives of the free acid (which often 5 comprise conjugated linoleic acid moieties) that can generate a compound with malodor. Preferable derivatives include those derived from substitution of the carboxyl group of the acid, such as esters (e.g. retinyl esters, triglyceride esters, monoglycerides esters diglyceride esters and phosphoesters), amides (e.g. ceramide derivatives), salts (e.g. alkali metal and alkali earth metal salts and ammonium salts); and/or those derived from 10 substitution of the C18 carbon chain, such as alpha and/or beta alkoxy and/or hydroxy derivatives.<br>
In the case of triglyceride ester derivatives, all positional isomers of CLA substituents on the glycerol backbone are included. The triglycerides should contain at least one CLA 15 moiety. For example, of the three esterifiable positions on the glycerol backbone, the 1 and 2 positions may be esterified with CLA and by another lipid at position 3 or as an alternative, the glycerol backbone could be esterified by CLA at the 1 and 3 positions with another lipid at position 2.<br>
20     "CLA moieties" are also included.  "CLA moieties" refer to CLA fatty acyl portion(s) of a CLA derivative.<br>
By "c9, t11 isomer enriched CLA" is meant that at least about 30% by weight of the total CLA and/or CLA moieties present in the composition is in the form of the cis 9, trans 11 25 isomer. Preferably, at least about 35%, and most preferably, at least 40% to 90% by weight of the total CLA and/or CLA moieties present in the composition, are in the form of the c9, t11 isomer, including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
However in one particular preferred embodiment, cis 9, trans 11 isomer and trans 10, cis 30 12 isomer (or any derivatives thereof) are present as the active at a weight ratio from 40:60 to 60:40, and preferably, at a weight ratio from 45:55 to 55:45, including all ratios subsumed therein. CLA type products suitable for use in this invention are available from suppliers like Stepan under the name Neobee® and Loders Croklaan under the name Clarinol™.<br>

The CLA and/or derivatives thereof comprising CLA moieties according to the present invention may be prepared, for example, according to the method disclosed in WO 97/18320, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
5 The CLA to be employed in accordance with the present invention is typically present in the skin care composition in an effective amount. Normally, the total amount of the ingredient that can degrade to yield a component with malodor is present in an amount from 0.00001% to 50% by weight of the composition. More preferably, the amount is from 0.01% to 10%, and most preferably, from 0.1% to 5% by weight of the composition,<br>
10     including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
Another ingredient that can degrade to yield a component with a malodor and that is suitable for use in this invention is a monoenoic fatty acid (i.e. monounsaturated fatty acid) like cis-4-decenoic, cis-9-decenoic, cis-5-lauroleic, cis-4-dodecenoic, cis-9-15 tetradecenoic, cis-5-teradecenoic, cis-4-tetradecenoic, cis-9-hexadecenoic, cis-6-octadecenoic, cis-9-octadecenoic, tr-9-octadecenoic, cis-11-octadecenoic, cis-9-eicosenoic, cis-11-eicosenoic, cis-11-docosenoic, cis-13-docosenoic, cis-15-tetracosenoic acid, derivatives thereof or mixtures thereof.<br>
20 The preferred monoenoic fatty acid suitable for use in this invention is cis-6-octadecenoic acid (i.e. petroselinic acid) whereby the same may be used alone, in combination with other monoenoic fatty acids and/or in combination with CLA and/or in combination with other active ingredients defined herein.<br>
25 If desired for use, the amount of monoenoic acid employed in the skin care composition of this invention is often from 0.005 to 35%, and preferably, from 0.01 to 25%, and most preferably, from 0.5 to 6% by weight, including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
As to component with malodor originally formulated in the skin care composition of this 30      invention,  such  a component is  not limited  and  often  is one which  comprises  a heteroatom, and especially, nitrogen.<br>
The only limitations with respect to the adsorbable solvent that may be used in this<br>
invention in that the same is suitable for use in a skin care composition, is not classified<br>
35      as a solvent with malodor (e.g. does not possess an aroma that is similar to hexanal) and<br>

Regarding the adsorbable solvent, the same typically has an Ra of less than 20, and preferably, less than 18, and most preferably, from 1 to 15, including all ranges subsumed therein. Ra was determined using Molecular Modelling 5 Pro (MMP) software available from ChemSW® (420-F Executive Court North, Fairfield, CA 94585, US).<br>
Illustrative and non-limiting examples of the types of adsorbable solvent that may be used in this invention include those comprising dimethicone, caprylyl methicone, wickenol,<br>
10 triolein, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, dipropylene glycol, mixtures thereof, or the like. Still others include propylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerin, sorbitol, any mixtures thereof or the like. In a most preferred embodiment, the adsorbable solvent is not an aldehyde, and especially, not a linear aldehyde which has 10 carbons or less.   In yet another preferred<br>
15     embodiment, the adsorbable solvent is dipropylene glycol (DPG).<br>
Typically, the adsorbable solvent makes up from 0.01 to 35%, and preferably, from 0.05 to 20%, and most preferably, from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the skin care composition, including all ranges subsumed therein. Often, the amount of adsorbable solvent 20 employed in the skin care composition of this invention is from 0.1 to 25%, and preferably, from 1 to 12%, and most preferably, from 1 to 5% by weight, based on total weight of the skin care composition and including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
As to the insoluble particle that may be used, the same is only limited to the extent that it 25 can be used in a skin care composition and has a surface area from 75 to 3500 m2/g. The surface area referred to is the specific surface area (SSA) which is defined as the total area of the particles divided by the total weight of the particles (m2/g). Values are obtained from a dry powder at room temperature using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 assuming the particles are spherical and non-porous. Illustrative examples of the types of 30 insoluble particles that may be used in this invention include those that comprise clays such as synthetic layered silicates, smectite minerals, fumed silicas and zeolites.<br>

Example 1<br>
Emulsions (i.e. skincare compositions) comprising CLA {50% cis 9, trans 11 and 50%<br>
trans 10, cis 12} were prepared by mixing CLA, sodium dodecyl sulfate (about 0.6%) and<br>
15 water. The resulting mixture was stirred on a stirring plate for about 20 minutes in order to dissolve the SDS into solution. The SDS solution with dispersed CLA was sonicated for about 2 minutes using an Ulbra Cell™ sonicator to yield stable emulsions. A first stable emulsion was completed by adding 2% DPG, a second was completed by adding 2.5% clay (Laponite® grade XLG) and a third was completed by adding 2% DPG and<br>
20 2.5% clay (Laponite® grade XLG). All completed emulsions were subjected to an additional two minutes of sonication. 3% CLA was present in each emulsion, water was added to balance and all percents are percents by weight based on total weight of the emulsion.<br>
25     Example 2<br>
Headspace analysis was performed on the CLA emulsions prepared in example 1. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) - gas chromatography (GC) 6890 / mass spectrometry (MS) 5973 / flame ionization detector (FID) from Agilent was used to identify the chemical composition of the vapor (i.e. aldehydes resulting from, for example, the oxidation of CLA)<br>
30 over aged (i.e. greater than 3 months old and stored at 60°C) emulsions. One gram of each of the above-described emulsions was filled in 20ml GC headspace sampling vials sealed with caps and septum. The GC column used was an HP-5MS column from Agilent (inner diameter 0.25mm, length 30m, stationary phase thickness 0.25um). GC conditions were such that the injector was in the splitless mode with helium gas as the<br>
35     carrier gas. The injection port was heated to 250°C, with purge flow at split vent 50ml/min<br>
 <br>

for 2 minutes. The column was set at a constant flow mode of 1.3 ml/min. Oven temperature ramp was held at 75°C for 2 minutes, and increased at a rate of 6°C/min to 100°C, 1.5°C/min to 15Q°C, 3°C/min to 190°C, 30°C/min to 300°C and held for two minutes. MS conditions were such that solvent delay was for 0.5 minutes and the scan 5 started from low mass 35 to high mass 300. The autosampler conditions were such that the samples were incubated at 35°C for 25 minutes with no agitation. SPME fiber was inserted into the sample headspace for a 5 minutes extraction and subsequently injected into the injector for a 15 minute desorption.<br>
10 The results in the table below demonstrate that the use of an insoluble particle and adsorbable solvent unexpectedly show a reduction in malodor that is greater than the sum of malodor reduction for compositions that only contain an insoluble particle and only contain adsorbable solvent.<br>
