				<td>A transmit circuit reduces undesired amplitude modulation (AM) in transmit signal pulses by substituting predetermined amplitude information for actual pulse amplitude information during portions of the pulse corresponding to nominally constant amplitudes. For example, GMSK and certain other modulation formats use a desired transmit pulse shape that includes a nominally flat middle portion. An exemplary AM reduction circuit detects generated pulse values corresponding to the nominally constant-amplitude portions of the transmit pulse and substitutes predetermined, preferably constant, amplitude values in their place. As such, the circuit may include a comparator used to detect the pulse values corresponding to variable amplitude portions of the pulse, which it passes through, and to detect those amplitude values corresponding to constant-amplitude portions of the pulse, which it replaces with substituted values. Such operation may include amplitude value filtering, and such operations may be modal, e.g., performed in dependence on modulation mode, etc.</td>

A METHOD AND APPARATUS TO REDUCE<br>
UNDESIRED AMPLITUDE MODULATION	 13.  03.  2006<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION		41<br>
5	The present invention generally relates to communication signal processing, and in<br>
particular relates to reducing undesired amplitude modulation in generated signal pulses.<br>
Communication signal transmitters, such as the transmitters in cellular radiotelephones or other   type of mobile communication device, generate transmit signal information in accordance with one or more defined communication standards or protocols.   For example, the <br>
10       ubiquitous Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard defines a Gaussian<br>
Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) transmit signal modulation format. GMSK is a form of non-linear continuous phase MSK modulation wherein a Gaussian filter is used to restrict the signal bandwidth.<br>
Although the modulation format is inherently nonlinear, GMSK signals can be<br>
15      approximated as a superposition of amplitude modulated pulses. Thus, “linearized" GMSK signals may be generated using Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) or, equivalently, Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK), based on an in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal pair. One advantage of generating linearized GMSK signals lies with the resultant efficiencies gained by reusing linear modulation signal processing elements.<br>
20	For example, the Enhanced Data rates through GSM Evolution (EDGE) standard<br>
provides a mechanism for increasing data rates in GSM-based networks via the adoption of an 8PSK modulation format. Thus, a GSM/EDGE terminal is required to generate both GMSK and 8PSK signals depending on its mode of operation. Since 8PSK modulation is inherently linear, such terminals must include linear signal processing elements and, thus, adopting a linearized<br>
25      GMSK signal format allows reuse of at least some of these processing elements.<br>
However, the adoption of linearized GMSK signal generation is not without its drawbacks.  For example, a certain amount of "ringing" is a common side effect of passing the l/Q components of linearized GMSK through the required pulse-shaping filter, i.e., the pulse mask that limits the spectral content of linearized GMSK pulses. That is, the nominally<br>
30      constant-amplitude portions of the generated linearized GMSK pulses in fact have a certain amount of undesired amplitude modulation that represent pulse shaping filter artifacts. These artifacts may or may not be harmful, depending on the limitations of the particular transmitter architecture, and on their magnitude.<br>
More generally, those skilled in the art will appreciate that transmit signal pulse<br>
35      generation, GMSK or otherwise, often yields imperfectly generated pulses that are subject to overshoot, undershoot, ringing, and other pulse generation artifacts. These artifacts may cause any number of problems with respect to transmit signal generation.<br><br>
1134 W01<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus to reduce undesired amplitude     modulation in generated transmit signal pulses. While the invention may have <br>
5      particular benefits in the context of compensating linearized GMSK pulses, it is not limited to<br>
such applications.  Indeed, the present invention broadly comprises a method of reducing undesired amplitude modulation in transmit signal pulses based on generating a transmit pulse according to a desired pulse shape, e.g., amplitude profile, and smoothing a section of the transmit pulse corresponding to a constant-amplitude portion of that shape. Exemplary<br>
10     smoothing comprises substituting pre-determined amplitude values, e.g., a constant (flat) value, for actual amplitude values of the generated pulse within the portion or portions of the pulse that are nominally flat.<br>
With the above in mind then, one embodiment of the present invention comprises a method of reducing undesired amplitude modulation in transmit signal pulses based on passing<br>
15     a data signal through a pulse shaping filter to obtain filtered pulse values that correspond to a desired transmit pulse shape, and obtaining modified pulse values having a reduction in undesired amplitude modulation for transmit signal generation. An exemplary method of obtaining the modified pulses is based on identifying the pulse values that correspond to a constant-amplitude portion of the desired transmit pulse shape, and substituting predetermined<br>
20      amplitude information for actual amplitude information in the identified pulse values. Complementing the above method, an exemplary transmit circuit comprises a processing circuit configured to receive filtered pulse values from a pulse shaping filter configured to output the pulse values according to a desired transmit pulse shape. The exemplary processing circuit is further configured to obtain modified pulse values having a<br>
25      reduction in undesired amplitude modulation for transmit signal generation by identifying the pulse values that correspond to a constant-amplitude portion of the desired transmit pulse shape, and substituting predetermined amplitude information for actual amplitude information in the identified pulse values.<br>
Thus, an exemplary mobile station, such as a cellular radiotelephone, or other type of<br>
30      mobile communication device, comprises a transceiver configured to transmit communication signals to the network and receive communication signals from the network. In accordance with the present invention, the exemplary transceiver includes a transmit circuit configured to reduce undesired amplitude modulation in transmitted signal pulses based on selectively substituting predetermined amplitude information for actual amplitude information in pulse values used to<br>
35      generate the transmitted signal pulses.<br>
-3-<br><br>
P19134W01<br>
The transmit signal pulses of interest may comprise linearized GMSK pulses, in which case, predetermined amplitude information can be substituted for the actual filter-generated pulse amplitude values that correspond to the nominally constant-amplitude "middle" portion of GMSK pulses. An exemplary transmit circuit can be configured to provide GMSK pulse values <br>
5      for transmit signal generation based on passing actual generated pulse amplitude values along for signal generation for the beginning and ending ramp portions of each pulse, but substituting a predetermined (constant) amplitude value for the middle portion of such pulses.<br>
More generally, however, the present invention comprises a method of reducing undesired amplitude variations in transmit signal pulses based on passing a data signal through <br>
10      a pulse shaping filter to obtain input pulse values that correspond to a desired transmit pulse shape, and generating output pulse values for transmit signal generation based on selectively substituting predetermined amplitude information for actual amplitude information in one or more of the input pulse values.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary AM reduction circuit 10 that is configured in accordance with one or more exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Circuit 10 is associated with<br>
30      a pulse-shaping filter 12 and various transmit signal generation circuits 14. In operation, circuit 10 receives input pulse values 16 from pulse shaping filter 12 representing a set of values generated according to a desired transmit pulse shape. As will be explained later herein, passing transmit symbol values through pulse shaping filter 12 may result in undesirable amplitude modulation artifacts, e.g., unwanted amplitude modulation.<br>
35	In exemplary operation, circuit 10 generates output pulse values 18 by eliminating or at<br>
least reducing the unwanted amplitude modulation in the input pulse values 16. The output<br>
-4-<br><br>
P19134W01<br>
pulse values 18 are then used in subsequent transmit signal generation by the transmit signal generation circuits 14. In reducing undesired amplitude modulations in transmit signal pulses, circuit 10 may receive amplitude threshold and/or desired amplitude information, which it may use to establish a threshold or baseline for flattening a nominally constant portion of the transmit <br>
5     pulse, for example.<br>
Exemplary operation of circuit 10 is depicted by Figs. 2A and 2B. In particular, Fig. 2A illustrates a desired transmit pulse shape (mask) that is imposed by pulse shaping filter 12, and illustrates that pulse values 16 may include undesirable amplitude modulation within a portion of the desired pulse shape that is intended to be a constant amplitude. As those skilled in the art<br>
10     will appreciate, such artifacts represent ringing or other digital filtering artifacts.<br>
Notably, pulse shaping filter 12 itself may be tailored to minimize undesired amplitude modulations in the pulse values 16, but that may result in overly complex filter structure and/or may compromise its performance in other applications, such as where it is used in different transmit modes to shape both linearized GMSK pulses and 8PSK pulses. In any case, in at<br>
15      least one mode of operation, circuit 10 receives input pulse values 16 that correspond<br>
imperfectly to a desired transmit pulse shape. In particular, circuit 10 receives a sequence of preferably digital values representing a transmit signal pulse that include amplitude modulations occurring within a nominally constant-amplitude portion of the desired transmit pulse shape. As shown in Fig. 2B, circuit 10 reduces these undesired amplitude modulations in the<br>
20      input pulse values 16 by generating output pulse values 18 that are used in actual transmit<br>
signal generation based on selectively substituting predetermined amplitude information for the actual amplitude information in selected ones of the input pulse values 16. In this specific embodiment, circuit 10 detects or otherwise identifies the particular input pulse values 16 that correspond to a nominally constant amplitude portion of the desired transmit pulse shape, and<br>
25     replaces actual amplitude information in those identified pulse values 16 with substituted values representing predetermined amplitude information.<br>
Thus, the output pulse values 18 provided by circuit 10 for use in actual transmit signal generation represent a selected combination of the originally generated pulse values 16 as provided by pulse shaping filter 12 and substituted pulse values as determined by or provided to<br>
30      circuit 10. In simple terms, circuit 10 thus reduces undesired amplitude modulation by<br>
recognizing the input pulse values that correspond to nominally constant amplitude portions of the desired transmit pulse shape and cleanly replacing them with appropriate predetermined pulse values that may, for example, correspond to a desired constant amplitude value.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates exemplary processing logic that may be implemented by circuit 10 for<br>
35      carrying out the above described amplitude information replacement. In this regard, it should be noted that circuit 10 may comprise hardware, software, or any combination thereof. As such,<br>
-5-<br><br>
P19134 W01<br>
circuit 10 may comprise all or a portion of a programmable microprocessor circuit, a Field ' Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), or other type of digital processing circuit. In an exemplary embodiment, amplitude modulation reduction is performed in the digital domain based on operating upon a series of digital sample values<br>
 5     representing the generated transmit pulse as output by (digital) pulse shaping filter 12, wherein<br>
digitally represented amplitude values of the generated pulses are selectively replaced with predetermined digital amplitude information.<br>
In any case, exemplary processing begins with mapping transmit data into corresponding transmit symbols. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this process<br>
10     broadly represents the mapping of information bits to be transmitted into corresponding<br>
modulation values (Step 100). The transmit symbols are passed through pulse shaping filter 12 to generate transmit pulse sample values in accordance with the desired transmit pulse shape (Step 102).<br>
Circuit 10 identifies the generated pulse values that correspond to a constant amplitude<br>
15      portion of the desired transmit pulse shape (Step 104). The actual amplitude information as generated via pulse shaping filter 12 in each of the identified input pulse values is replaced with predetermined (e.g., constant) pulse amplitude information (Step 106). Thus, actual transmit signal generation is performed based on a mix of actual amplitude information from the generated transmit pulse and substituted preferably constant-valued amplitude information for at<br>
20      least a portion of the generated pulse.<br>
Although the present invention has broad applicability, Fig. 4 illustrates its implementation in the context of a mobile communication device 30, which may be, but is not limited to, cellular radiotelephones, portable digital assistants (PDAs), palmtop/laptop computers, pagers, and other types of portable wireless electronic devices. Exemplary mobile<br>
25     terminal 30 comprises an antenna 32, a switch/duplexer 34, a receiver 36, a transmitter 38, a system controller or processor 40, and a user interface 42, which may comprise a display, a keyboard, a speaker, and a microphone.<br>
The exemplary transmitter 38 comprises a processor circuit 44 that includes exemplary implementations of the aforementioned AM reduction circuit 10 and pulse shaping filter 12.<br>
30      Here, the transmit signal generation circuits 14 are configured for polar modulation wherein the information to be transmitted is separated into corresponding phase and amplitude information signals. As such, transmit signal generation circuits 14 comprise a phase modulator 46, a power amplifier (PA) 48, and an amplitude modulator 50.<br>
In this configuration, processing circuit 44 provides a phase information signal to phase<br>
35      modulator 46, which in turn provides a constant envelope phase-modulated input signal to PA 48. Processing circuit 44 further provides an amplitude modulation information signal to<br><br><br>
P19134W01<br>
amplitude modulator 50, which imparts amplitude modulations in the radio frequency (RF) output signal of PA 48 that are synchronized with the phase modulation information input to PA 48 by phase modulator 46. In exemplary embodiments, the amplitude modulator 50 modulates the input supply voltage and/or input supply current to PA 48 to impart the desired amplitude<br>
 5     modulation to the PA's RF output signal. The general operation of polar modulation, also referred to as "envelope elimination and restoration" (EER) transmit signal generation is well known to those skilled in the art and is not further described herein.<br>
In operation, transmitter circuit 38 generates transmit signal pulses based on receiving transmit data from system controller 40, for example. Processing circuit 44 also may originate<br>
10     certain data for transmission. Regardless, in at least one mode of operation, the transmit data is used to form transmit signal pulses that are passed through pulse shaping filter 12 and which, as a result, may include undesired amplitude modulation that is removed or reduced by circuit 10. As alluded to earlier herein, such circumstances may arise where mobile terminal 30 is configured for GSM/EDGE operation, such that pulse shaping filter 12 is configured in terms of<br>
15      bandwidth, etc., to filter both linearized GMSK pulses as well as 8PSK pulses, in which case the linearized GMSK pulses may include ringing or other AM artifacts during portions of the generated pulses that nominally are constant-amplitude.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of processor circuit 44 in a polar modulation configuration. Transmit data is passed through a symbol mapper 52 that creates in-phase and<br>
20      quadrature modulation symbol values (ISYM and QSYM) that are passed through up-sampler 54 to produce up-sampled in-phase and quadrature symbol values(lSYM' and QSYM’)- (Here, up-sampling aids subsequent filtering operations.)<br>
In turn, these up-sampled values are passed through pulse shaping filter 12 to produce generated pulse values corresponding to a desired transmit signal pulse shape. These<br>
25     generated pulse values are input to circuit 10, which here comprises a control circuit 60, and a comparator 62. Circuit 10 further includes, or is associated with, a polar converter 64, a digital filter 66, and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) 68.<br>
Polar converter 64 separates the incoming pulse values into corresponding phase and amplitude values, which may be normalized phase and amplitude values. Digital filter 66<br>
30     receives the separated phase and amplitude values, filters them and passes them along for<br>
subsequent transmit signal generation. Generally, the phase values operated on by digital filter 66 are the actual phase values as output by pulse shaping filter 12, whereas the amplitude values operated on by digital filter 66 either comprise actual phase values from pulse shaping filter 12 as passed through by circuit 10, or predetermined amplitude values as substituted by<br>
35      circuit 10.<br>
-7- <br>
P19134W01<br>
For example, assume that mobile terminal 30 is configured for at least two modes of communication, each having a different modulation format. By way of non-limiting example, mobile terminal 30 may be configured to operate in a first mode wherein it uses GMSK modulation, and in a second mode wherein it uses 8PSK modulation. (This type of modal<br>
5     operation would be found in a GSM/EDGE terminal, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to such examples.) For operation in GMSK mode, terminal 30 uses processor circuit 44 in its transmitter 38 to generate linearized GMSK pulses via pulse shaping filter 12.<br>
The pulse values generated by pulse shaping filter 12 are "monitored" by comparator 62<br>
10      such that control circuit 10 can identify which generated pulse values correspond to the<br>
nominally-constant amplitude portion of the desired transmit pulse shape. In the context of linearized GMSK, for example, one may refer to Figs. 2A and 2B to see that a nominal transmit pulse shape includes a rising amplitude beginning portion, a nominally constant-amplitude<br>
middle portion, and a falling amplitude ending portion.<br>
15	Thus, comparator 62 may be configured to receive (or store) amplitude threshold<br>
information, which can be set at a level corresponding to a desired amplitude value for the middle portion of the desired transmit pulse shape. With that configuration, then, the separated (actual) amplitude values provided by polar converter 64 are input to comparator 62 for comparison to the defined amplitude threshold. The actual amplitude values below the<br>
20      threshold, i.e., those amplitude values corresponding to the rising and falling portions of the pulse, are passed through control circuit 60 as output amplitude values to be used in transmit signal generation (after filtering via digital filter 66). However, the actual amplitude values detected by comparator 62 as being above the desired amplitude threshold are blocked by control circuit 60, which outputs substituted predetermined amplitude values in their place for<br>
25     use in transmit signal generation (after filtering via digital filter 66).<br>
Note that comparator 62 can be configured with a desired amount of hysteresis, so that it more reliably detects the rising edge-to-middle and middle-to-falling edge pulse transitions and does not respond to ringing within the actual amplitude values of the middle pulse portion. Alternatively, the defined amplitude threshold can be set low enough such that even the lowest-<br>
30      valued actual amplitude values output by pulse shaping filter 12 over the middle pulse portion are above the comparator threshold. Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations are possible and that the aim is to achieve reliable detection of those amplitude values that should be passed through and those amplitude values that should be replaced by substituted information. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that such detection<br>
35      operation will be modified as needed for other transmit pulse shapes.<br><br><br>
P19134W01<br>
Of further note, it will be understood that control circuit 60 and comparator 62 preferably operate in the digital domain. By way of non-limiting example, pulse amplitude information may be generated using twelve-bit digital values for a signed range of -2048 to +2047. Assuming that a value of 1500 represents a nominal amplitude for the constant amplitude portion of the <br>
5     linearized GMSK pulses, comparator 62 may be configured to detect when the actual amplitude<br>
values from polar converter 64 are below this value, and to signal control circuit 60 in response thereto. In turn, control circuit 60 may substitute a constant value of 1500 (or some other value as desired) in place of any actual amplitude values detected as above that threshold. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize that such numeric ranges and operational details<br>
10      are a matter of implementation to be varied as needed or desired for a particular design. Additionally, it may be seen from Fig. 5 that control circuit 60 may receive a mode control signal or other type of indicator that is used to control its operation. For example, control circuit 60 can be configured such that it performs its selective substitution of amplitude information in one mode but not in another mode (i.e., for GMSK modulation mode but not for<br>
15      non-GMSK modulation mode). Similarly, digital filter 66 can be configured for modal operation such that low-pass filtering is applied to the outgoing amplitude values in one mode but not in another mode. That is, filter 66 may be configured to filter the amplitude values in modes where control circuit 60 performs its selective amplitude substitution but not to filter the amplitude values where control circuit 60 simply passes through the actual amplitude values.<br>
20	Filtering of the outgoing amplitude values, i.e., the amplitude values to be used in<br>
transmit signal generation by transmit signal generation circuits 14, is particularly beneficial where the amplitude substitution operations of control circuit 60 are active. That is, substituting predetermined amplitude values in place of a portion of the generated (actual) amplitude values for a given transmit signal pulse introduces a functional discontinuity in the pulse amplitude<br>
25     information with attendant increases in higher frequency spectral content. Thus, amplitude<br>
value filtering is desirable. The exemplary digital filter 66 further includes low-pass filters to filter the phase values in advance of transmit signal generation for further spectral control, and such filtering may or may not be modal.<br>
In general, then, comparator 62 may be configured with one or more defined amplitude<br>
30      thresholds, which may be digital magnitude values, that it uses to identify which generated amplitude values correspond to nominally constant-amplitude portions of a desired transmit signal pulse shape. Comparator 62 signals control circuit 60 responsive to such identification, such that control circuit 60 performs selective substitution of predetermined amplitude information. That is, control circuit 60 passes through the actual amplitude information from<br>
35      polar converter 64 (or from pulse shaping filter 12 in non-polar modulation configurations) for pulse values corresponding to non-constant amplitude portions of a transmit pulse, and<br><br><br>
P19134W01<br>
substitutes predetermined, preferably flat, amplitude information for pulse values corresponding to constant-amplitude portions of the transmit pulse.<br>
The exemplary AM reduction circuit 10 may be configured to operate modally, wherein it performs its selective substitution of amplitude operation in one mode but not in another mode. <br>
5     Further, such operations preferably are carried out in the digital domain, but it should be<br>
understood that all or a portion of such operations can be carried out in the analog domain, e.g., control circuit 60, comparator 62, and selected other circuit elements may be analog circuits. In general, then, the foregoing discussion does not limit the present invention. Indeed, the present invention is limited only by the following claims and their reasonable equivalents.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A METHOD AND APPARATUS TO REDUCE UNDESIRED AMPLITUDE MODULATION<br>
A transmit circuit reduces undesired amplitude modulation (AM) in transmit signal pulses by substituting predetermined amplitude information for actual pulse amplitude information during portions of the pulse corresponding to nominally constant amplitudes. For example, GMSK and certain other modulation formats use a desired transmit pulse shape that includes a nominally flat middle portion. An exemplary AM reduction circuit detects generated pulse values corresponding to the nominally constant-amplitude portions of the transmit pulse and substitutes predetermined, preferably constant, amplitude values in their place. As such, the circuit may include a comparator used to detect the pulse values corresponding to variable amplitude portions of the pulse, which it passes through, and to detect those amplitude values<br>
corresponding to constant-amplitude portions of the pulse, which it replaces with substituted values. Such operation may include amplitude value filtering, and such operations may be modal, e.g., performed in dependence on modulation mode, etc.<br></td>
