Ref.20'012<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of trans-(R,R)-actinol by diastereoselective transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an amino-amide-ruthenium complex as the catalyst.<br>
Optically active actinol is known inter alia as an important building block for the synthesis of carotenoidssuch as, for example, ofzeaxanthin [Pure &amp; Appj. Chem. 5], 535-564 (1979)]. In known processes actinol is manufactured from the trimethylcyclohexadione levodione. One such process is based, for example, on the catalytic hydrogenation of levodione in the presence of Raney nickel with a low base content [Helv. Chim. Acta^, 1832 (1976)]. Thepoordiastereoselectivity of the heterogeneous hydrogenation, which leads to a 3-4:1 mixture of trans-and cis-actinol, results, however, in a loss in yield by virtue of the complicateted purification; moreover there is a danger of a racemization of the levodione under the reaction conditions used in the heterogeneous catalysis. An alternative purification using a suitable distillation column is described in EP-A 0 775 685, but the yields are modest. The interest in manufacturing methods which yield actinol with high enantiomeric and diastereomeric purity is as great now as it always has been.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that (R)-levodione can be converted into (R,R)-actinol in good chemical yield and in high optical yield by transfer hydrogenation in the presence of an amino-amide-ruthenium complex.<br>
The invention is accordingly concerned with a process for the manufacture of trans-(R,R)-actinol (1)<br>
  1<br>
by the diastereoselective transfer hydrogenation of levodione, which process comprises hydrogenating (R)-levodione (2)<br>
PaySo 16.9.98<br><br>
  2<br>
in the presence of a hydrogen donor, which simultaneously can be used as the solvent, and an amino-amide-ruthenium complex.<br>
Processes for the manufacture of alcohols from ketones by transfer hydrogenation are known. Thus, for example, R. Noyori et al. [Ace. Chem. Res. 30, 97-102 (1997)] have investigated the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aryl alkyl ketones, such as, for example, acetophenone, which can be hydrogenated v^fith high optical and chemical yield in the presence of a hydrogen donor, e.g. isopropanol/potassium hydroxide or acetic acid/triethylamine, and a ruthenium complex. However, not only the chemical yields, hut also the optical yields diminish considerable when, for example, dialkyl ketones are used as substrates.<br>
For the process in accordance with the invention there is preferably used an amino-amide-ruthenium complex of the general formula<br>
RuH(L{-H})(Y)	I<br><br><br>
R^ and R^	each independently signify hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or optionally<br>
mono- or multiply-substituted aryl, or R" and R^ together with the associated grouping -CH-(CH2)n-CH' form a carbocycle with 4 to S carbon atoms,<br>
R^	signifies hydrogen or alkyl, and<br>
n	signifies 0, 1, 2 or 3.<br>
The monosulphonylated diamine is present in the complex as a monoanion and is accordingly denoted in formula I as "L{-H|".<br>
In thescopeof the present invention the term "alkyJ" embraces straight-chain or branched optionally chiral alky! groups with 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably with 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Methyl, ethyJ, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyJ, isobuty], tert.butyl, n-pentyJ and isopentyl are examples of such groups. Trifluromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl and penlafluoroethy] are examples of mono- or mulliply-fluorinated alkyl groups.<br>
The term "alkenyl" embraces straight-chain or branched alkenyl groups with 3 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. allyl, 2-butenyl and 3-butenyl.<br>
The term "alkynyl" signifies a straight-chain or branched alkynyl group with one triple bond and 3 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. propynyl and butynyl,<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" signifies a 3- to 7-membered alicyclic group, namely cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopent)'l, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl, of which cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl are preferred.<br>
The term "optionally mono- or multiply-substituted aryl" embraces a phenyl or naphthyl group, which can be unsubstituted, mono-substituted or multiply-substituted. As substitutents there come into consideration e.g. phenyl, halogen and straight-chain and branched alkyl and alkox&gt;' groups with in each case 1 to 5 carbon atoms, whereby the multiply-substituted phenyl or naphthyl groups can have the same or different subsitutents. Of the alkyl and alkox)' groups the methyl and, respectively, methoxy group is preferred. Examples of optionally substituted aryl groups are phenyl, chloro-, bromo-and fluorophenyi, tolyl, anisy!, 2,4-dimethylphenyI as well as naphthyl.<br><br>
The term "heteroaryl" embraces 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic groups featuring O, S or N such as, for example, furyl, thienyl, benzofuryl, dibenzofuryl, xanthenyl, pyrrolyl and pyridinyl. The heterocychc groups featuring O are especially preferred.<br>
Under the term "neutral ligand" there is to be understood in the scope of the present invention an arene, especially benzene, naphthalene or tetralin, which in the case of benzene can be mono- or muhiply-substituted with straight-chain or branched alkyl and/or alkoxy groups with in each case 1 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably methyl or methoxy groups, and/or with cycloalkyl groups. Examples of such hgands are benzene, p-cymene, toluene, anisole, xylene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, p-dicyclohexylbenzene, naphthalene and tetralin.<br>
The (R)-levodione used as the starting material in the process in accordance with the invention can be obtained, as is known, inter alia by fermentation and is commercially available.<br>
A particular class of amino-amide-ruthenium complexes used in process in accordance with the invention consists of those of formula I which have a ligand of formula II in which R' and R each independendy signify hydrogen, alky!, cycloalkyl or optionally mono- or multiply-substititued aryl, or R^ and R' together with the associated grouping -CH-(CH2)n-CH- signifies a carbocycle with 4-6 carbon atoms, n signifies 0 or 1 and R' and R'* have the significances given above.<br>
Preferred monosulphonylated diamine ligands L are those of formula II in which R' and R^ have the same significance and signify either hydrogen or phenyl. Likewise preferred are the ligands L in which R' and R^ together with the associated grouping -CH-{CH2)n-CH-form a carbocycle with 4 to 8 carbon atoms. In both cases R* preferably signifies hydrogen. Of these preferred hgands L there are especially preferred those in which n signifies 0.<br>
Particularly preferred ligands L are the optically active monosulphonylated diamine ligands of formula II in which both R^ and R have a sigificance other than hydrogen.<br>
Irrespective of whether the monosulphonylated diamine ligands L are optically active or not, there are preferred those ligands L of formula II in which R signifies a tolyl, anisyl or naphthyl group.<br><br>
Examples of the particularly preferred monosulphonylated diamine ligands L are: (lS,2S)-N-(2-Amino-l,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide, (lR,2R)-N-(2-amino-l,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide, (lRS,2RS)'N-(2-amino-l,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide (racemic), (lS,2S)-N-(2-amino-l,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-4-methoxy-benzenesulphonamide, naphthalene-1-sulphonic acid f{lS,2S)-(2-amino-l,2-dipheny!-ethyl)-amide], {lR,2R)-N-(2-amino-cyclohexyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide, (lRS,2RS)-N--(2-amino-cyclohexyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide (racemic), N-(2-amino-ethyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide and N-(3-amino-propyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide.<br>
While the first seven compounds are chiral, the eighth- and ninth-mentioned compounds are not chiral compounds.<br>
The process in accordance with the invention (the transfer hydrogenation) is conveniently effected in a solvent, which simultaneously serves as the hydrogen donor, or in a mixture of a hydrogen donor with a suitable inert solvent. As the hydrogen donor and at the same time the solvent there can be used especially alcohols, preferably secondary alcohols, e.g. isopropanol. As mixtures of hydrogen donors with an inert solvent there are conveniently used mixtures of alcohols with inert solvents, preferably a mixture of an alcohol with a lower aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride or ethylene chloride. Other suitable hydrogen donor/solvent mixtures are mixtures of formic acid or a salt thereof with an inert solvent, e.g. tri ethyl amine. Isopropanol is particularly preferred as the hydrogen donor/solvent. In this case acetone is formed and this can, if desired, be removed continuously from the reaction system. WTien formic acid or a salt thereof in an inert solvent is used as the reducing agent, an about stoichometric amount of formic acid or a salt thereof based on the amount of (R)-levodione is as a rule employed.<br>
When mixtures of hydrogen donors with inert solvents are used, in principle all mixture ratios apply.<br>
The ratio of catalyst (ammo-amide-ruthenium complex) to (R)-levodione is conveniently about 1:20 to about 1:10 000 mol:mol, preferably about 1:200 to about 1:2000.<br>
The diasteroselective transfer hydrogenation in accordance with the inventiori is conveniently effected at a temperature of about 0"C to about 100°C, preferably of about<br><br>
20°C to about 50°C, and, if desired, under a protective gas, preferably argon. Moreover, as a rule it is performed under normal pressure or under a slight vacuum (in order, for example, to facilitate the removal of acetone formed from isopropanol).<br>
Conventional methods ot organic chemistry, e.g. distillation and crystallization, can he used for the isolation and purification of the thus-manufactured trans-(R,R)-actinol.<br>
The amino-amide-ruthenium complex of formula I used as the catalyst for the diastereoselective transfer hydrogenation in accordance with the invention need not necessarily be employed as such. Thus, it has been found practicable to generate the catalyst in situ in the reaction system, which is effected according to the production processes described below.<br>
The amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I used as catalysts in accordance with the invention can be produced as outlined in Scheme 1<br><br>
In Scheme I the symbols other than X have the aforementioned significances; X stands for chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially for chlorine.<br>
In accordance with Route A the ruthenium catalysts of formula I are generated by reaction of the ruthenium-halogen complex of type 4 with a hydride donor, such as, for example, sodium formate or sodium methylate, in a solvent, e.g. in a lower alcohol or especially in<br><br>
the two-phase system methylene chloride/water. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature. The complex formation has normally finished already after about 30 minutes. This is a method known per se for the conversion of Ru(II)-halogen complexes into Ru(I!)-hydride complexes [see, for example, Principles and Applications of Organotransition Metal Chemistry, J,P. Collman et al., University Science Books (1987) and Organometallics 4, 1202 et seq. (1985)]. It is especially suitable for the in situ production of the amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I.<br>
The ruthenium catalysts of formula I can also be obtained (Route B) by converting a ruthenium-halogen complex of type 4 with a base, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide or thallium ethylate, into the ruthenium-diamide complex of type 5 and subsequent reaction of the latter complex with an alcohol, e.g. isopropanol which simultaneously serves as the solvent. Mixtures of alcohols and/or water with an inert solvent, such as, for example, methylene chloride, can also be used as the solvent in this case. Also in this case, the reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature and the complex formation is normally completed within 30 minutes.<br>
Further references to these known methods are described in R. Noyori et al., J. Am. Chem, Soc. US, 2521 (1996) and R. Noyori et al, Angew. Chemie i09 (3), 297 (1997). In these and other literature references, e.g. in PCT Patent Publication WO 97/20789, there are described some amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I in which R^ and R^ each have a significance other than hydrogen (which accordingly have chiral centres) and their production in the above manner. The novel complexes of this class can be produced in an analogous manner.<br>
A further method for the production of the amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I used as catalysts in accordance with the invention is set forth in Scheme II hereinafter:<br>
Scheme II: Route C<br>
[RuX2(Y)];      +	II	+	HCOONa        +	KOH    -*	I<br>
In this Scheme X signifies chlorine, bromine or iodine. Y has the significance given above and II stands for the optionally optically active, monosulphonylated diamine of formula II<br><br>
(ligand L) given above. The reaction conditions (solvent, reaction temperature and reaction period), correspond to those for Route A and Route B.<br>
The ligands L (of formula II} present in the above-described complexes are in part known compounds [see, for example, J.A.C.S. 62, 2811-2812 (1940)], and some of them are commercially available. Optically active diamines which are not commercially available can be obtained by resolution of the corresponding racemic diamines. The remaining (novel) ligands L can be produced analgously to the known ligands L.<br>
Especially preferred amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I are those in which the ligand L is N-(2-amino-ethyl)-4-methyl-benzenesuiphonamide, N-(3-amino-propyl)-4-methyi-benzenesuIphonamide, N-(2-amino-l,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-4-methyi-benzene-sulphonamide or N-(2-amino-cyc!ohexyl)-4-methyl-benzenesulphonamide.<br>
Those amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of formula I in which L signifies a monosulphonylated diamine of the genera! formula<br>
R' SOrHN-CH2-(CH,)n-CH2-NHR^	II'<br>
(i.e. of formula II wherein R' and R' are both hydrogen) in which R' , R"* and n have the significances given above, are novel and are likewise an object of the present invention. Because the two carbon atoms which carry the group NH-SO;R' and, respectively, NHR' are not chiral, the diamine ligands of formula 11' differ from those diamine ligands of formula 11 which have a substiutent at these positions (R' and R' each have a significance other than hydrogen).<br>
The corresponding amino-amide-ruthenium complexes of the formula RuX{L'{-H|)(Y), wherein X signifies chlorine, bromine or iodine, L' signifies a monosulphonylated diamine of formula 11' and Y signifies a neutral ligand, are also novel and represent a further aspect of the present invention.<br><br>
Accordingly the  present  invention  provides  a     process  for the manufacture of trans-(R,R)-actinol of formula (1)<br><br><br><br>
