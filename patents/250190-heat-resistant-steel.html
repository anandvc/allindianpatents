				<td>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to a steel product, which at<br>
high temperatures forms an oxide scale with good surface conductivity and<br>
an excellent adhesion to the underlying steel. In particular, it relates to a<br>
ferritic chromium steel suitable for the use as interconnects or bipolar plates<br>
in solid oxide fuel cells or other high temperature applications such as<br>
catalytic converters in cars and trucks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Ferritic chromium steels are used for applications with high<br>
requirements on heat resistance, such as for example interconnect materials<br>
in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) or if alloyed with Al, as a material for<br>
catalytic converters. They are very suitable materials for use in SOFC<br>
applications since the Thermal Expansion Coefficients (TEC) of ferritic steels<br>
are close to the TECs of the electro-active ceramic materials used in the<br>
SOFC stack, such as yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which is the common<br>
material used as electrolyte in the fuel cell. This has/for instance, been<br>
studied by Linderoth et al. in "Investigation of Fe-Cr ferritic steels as SOFC<br>
interconnect material", Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proa, Vol. 575, (1999), pp.<br>
325-330.<br>
It is desired that the oxide scale formed on the steel interconnect<br>
material does not spall off or crack due to thermal cycling, i.e., the oxide<br>
scale should have good adhesion. The formed oxide scale should also have<br>
good electrical conductivity and not grow too thick during the life time of the<br>
fuel cell, since thicker oxide scales will lead to an increased electrical<br>
resistance. The formed oxide should also be chemically resistant to the<br>
gases used as fuels in an SOFC, i.e., no volatile metal-containing species<br>
such as chromium oxyhydroxides should be formed. Volatile species such<br>
as chromium oxyhydroxide will contaminate the electro-active ceramic<br>
materials in a SOFC stack, which will lead to a decrease in the efficiency of<br>
the fuel cell.<br>
One disadvantage with the use of commercial ferritic chromium steel<br>
is that they are usually alloyed with aluminum and/or silicon, which form<br>
AI2O3 and/or SiO2 at the working temperature of the SOFC. Both these<br>
oxides are good electrical insulating oxides, which will increase the electrical<br>
resistance of the cell and lower the fuel cell efficiency.<br>
This has led to the development of ferritic steels with low Al and Si<br>
contents, to ensure good conductivity of the formed oxide scales. These<br>
newly developed steels are usually also alloyed with manganese. The<br>
addition of Mn in the steel will induce the formation of chromium oxide based<br>
spinell structures in the formed oxide scale. However, Mn in general has a<br>
poor effect on the corrosion resistance of the steel; it is therefore desired that<br>
the Mn content in the steel be monitored carefully at low levels. Too high a<br>
concentration of Mn in the steel will lead to the growth of thick oxide scales<br>
due to severe high temperature corrosion.<br>
In addition to Mn, several of these new developed steels are alloyed<br>
with group III elements, i.e., Sc, La and Y and/or other rare earth elements<br>
(REM). The addition of La, Y or REM is made to increase the lifetime of the<br>
material at high temperatures. Strong oxide formers such as La, Y and REM<br>
are said to decreases the oxygen ion mobility in the formed Cr2O3 scale,<br>
which will lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the oxide scale. The<br>
amount of added REM to the'steel has to be carefully monitored, since too<br>
high a concentration of REM will lead to production process difficulties, as<br>
well as undesired corrosion properties of the steel.<br>
In patent application US 2003/0059335, the steel is alloyed with a<br>
small amount of La (0.01 - 0.4% by weight) and optionally also with small<br>
amounts of Y and Ce (0.1 to 0.4% by weight).<br>
In patent application EP 1 298 228 A2, the steel is also alloyed with<br>
either Y (= 0.5% by weight) or REM (= 0.2% by weight) or La (0.005 - 0.1%<br>
by weight).<br>
In US 6,294,131 B1, the steel is also alloyed with REM (0.005 to 0.5<br>
% by weight) and in patent application US 2002/0192468 A1 the final steel is<br>
alloyed with 0.01 - 1.5% yttrium, rare earth metals, and oxides thereof.<br>
In addition to these above-mentioned patents, there are some<br>
commercially available ferritic steel for interconnects in SOFC. Two of these<br>
are the steel sorts A and B (see further details of A and B in Example 3<br>
below), A being alloyed with 0.04% La, and B with a La content of max 0.2%<br>
by weight. All the above mentioned patents and commercially available<br>
steels are alloyed with small amounts of rare earth metals such as Y, La and<br>
Ce. The addition of reactive rare earth metals will lead to a decrease in<br>
corrosion resistance compared with the steel alloy of this invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a steel alloy with<br>
excellent high temperature corrosion resistance. Another object of the<br>
present invention is that the oxide scale on said steel alloy has a good<br>
adherence and a low surface resistivity. A further object of the present<br>
invention is that the above mentioned properties are so good that said alloy<br>
does not need alloying with any REM or group'III metals, which in turn will<br>
lead to a simpler and more cost-effective steel production process. Yet<br>
another object of the present invention is to provide a steel alloy for the<br>
manufacturing of interconnects and/or bi-polar plates to Solid Oxide Fuel<br>
Cells. A further object of the present invention is to provide a steel alloy for<br>
the manufacturing of catalytic converters in automobile applications.<br>
The above objects and further advantages are achieved by carefully<br>
monitoring the contents of different alloying elements of the steel alloy, in<br>
accordance with claim 1. This is done by alloying the steel with 20 to 25%<br>
by weight of chromium and monitoring the content of oxide formers such as<br>
silicon, aluminum and manganese at low levels. In addition to this,<br>
elements, such as Ni, Mo and group IV (titanium group) and group V<br>
elements (vanadium group) of the periodic table of elements, are added to<br>
the alloy. Said alloy is produced in a conventional steel production process.<br>
The final product of said alloy can have the form of a strip, foil, wire, tube,<br>
bar or even as a powder, preferably as strip or a foil.<br>
One factor is that said alloy is heat resistant at temperatures up to<br>
900°C and that the oxide scale formed does not grow too thick. Therefore,<br>
the mass gain per unit area of said alloy is less than 1.5 mg/cm2, when the<br>
steel alloy has been oxidized in air or in air +1% H2O mixture for 1000 hours<br>
at 850°C or any environment similar to the gases used in a Solid Oxide Fuel<br>
Cell. A further aspect is that the grown oxide scale does not spall off, i.e.,<br>
has a good adhesion to the underlying alloy.<br>
To be able to use the steel alloy as interconnect or bipolar plate in<br>
SOFC, the thermal expansion of said alloy should not deviate considerably<br>
from the thermal expansions of the anode material or the electrolyte material<br>
used in the fuel cell. Therefore, said alloy has a thermal expansion<br>
coefficient of 10 to 15-10-6oC -1 in the temperature range 0 to 900°C, or even<br>
more preferably 11 to 14 10-6oC -1 and most preferably 11.5 to 13-10-6 °C-1.<br>
As a consequence thereof, the thermal expansion mismatch (TEM) between<br>
the electro-active ceramic materials in the fuel cell and the thermal<br>
expansion of said alloy is not greater than ± 25%, or preferably less than ±<br>
20%, or most preferred lower than ± 15%. Here the thermal expansion<br>
mismatch (TEM) is defined as (TECSS - TECce)/TECSs, where the TECSS is the<br>
thermal expansion of the steel alloy and TECce is the thermal expansion of<br>
the electro-active ceramic materials used in anode-supported fuel cells.<br>
Yet another important object is that said alloy has a good conductivity.<br>
The bipolar plate works as a current collector in a fuel cell. To avoid<br>
degradation of the fuel cell efficiency, the contact resistance of the steel alloy<br>
is kept as low as possible throughout the lifetime of the fuel cell. The area<br>
specific resistance (ASR) of said alloy in a SOFC setup should be kept low<br>
but also the increment of ASR with time is kept as low as possible. If the<br>
increment of the ASR is large, this can lead to a decrease of the fuel cell<br>
efficiency.<br>

and balance of Fe and naturally occurring impurities, but not more<br>
than 0.010% of S impurity. Said alloy is produced in an ordinary steel<br>
production process.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the disclosed steel alloy, the<br>
chemical composition comprises the following elements (by weight-%):<br>
C = 0.1% but more than zero, preferably 0.001 = C = 0.1%<br>
N = 0.1% but more than zero, preferably 0.001 = N = 0.1%<br>
O = 0.1% but more than zero, preferably 0.001 = O = 0.1%<br>

Cr 20 to 25%<br>
Ni = 1.0 % but more than zero, preferably 0.01 = Ni = 1.0%<br>
Zr = 0.1% but more than zero, preferably 0.001 = Zr = 0.1%<br>
Ti = 0.5% but more than zero, preferably 0.01 = Ti = 0.4%<br>
Mo = 2.5% but more than zero, preferably 0.01 = Mo = 2.5% or even<br>
more preferably 0.1 = Mo = 2.0%<br>
Nb = 1.25% but more than zero, preferably 0.01 = Nb = 1.25%<br>
V = 0.1 % but more than zero, preferably 0.01 = V = 0.1%<br>
and balance of Fe and naturally occurring impurities, but not more<br>
than 0.010 % of S impurity. Said alloy is produced in an ordinary steel<br>
production process.<br>
High Temperature Corrosion Resistance: The disclosed alloy is heat<br>
resistant at temperatures up to 900°C and the oxide scale formed upon<br>
oxidization does not grow too thick. In Table 1, the theoretical mass gain per<br>
area unit for a chromium oxide scale with different thicknesses is calculated.<br>
The calculations assume that a dense and pure Cr2O3 scale.is formed on the<br>
surface of the steel. The Cr2O3 has a density of 5300 mg/cm3 and the mass<br>
percent of oxygen in the Cr2O3 is 31.6%. This will gjve a mass gain per unit<br>
area of 0.16 mg/cm2 for a 1 µm thick pure and dense chromium oxide scale,<br>
and 0.82 mg/cm2 for 5 µm thick oxide scale.<br>
Noted here should be that these values of mass gain of the formation<br>
of pure Cr2O3 are theoretical. When a ferritic chromium steel alloy is<br>
oxidized, usually mixed oxides are formed and the weight gain depends on<br>
the added alloying elements. However, a low weight gain is important since<br>
higher weight gains will lead to thicker oxide scale formations, which in turn<br>
will increase the resistance of the steel. The disclosed steel alloy therefore<br>
has a weight gain of less than 1.5 mg/cm2 after 1000 hours of exposure to<br>
air and/or air + 1% H2O at 850°C.<br>
A further feature is that the grown oxide scale does not spall off, i.e.,<br>
has a good adhesion to the underlying alloy.<br>
Thermal Expansion: To be able to use steel as interconnects or bipolar<br>
plates in SOFC, the thermal expansion of the alloy should not deviate greatly<br>
from the thermal expansion of the anode material or the electrolyte material<br>
used in the fuel cell. Therefore, the steel alloy has a thermal expansion<br>
coefficient of 10 to 15-10-6 °C-1 in the temperature range 0 to 900°C, or even<br>
more preferably 11 to 1410-6 °C-1, and most preferably 11.5 to 13-10-6 °C-1.<br>
Further, the thermal expansion mismatch (TEM) between the electro-active<br>
ceramic materials in the fuel cell and the thermal expansion of said alloy is<br>
not greater than ± 25%, preferably less than ± 20%, and most preferably<br>
lower than ±15%.<br>
Here the thermal expansion mismatch (TEM) is defined as (TECSS-<br>
TECce)/TECSs, where the TECSS is the thermal expansion of the alloy and<br>
TECce is the thermal expansion of the electro-active ceramic materials. The<br>
thermal expansion of said steel alloy can be tuned to match the thermal<br>
expansion of the electro-active ceramic materials in the fuel cell by carefully<br>
monitoring the amount of alloying elements, such as nickel, in the steel alloy.<br>
Conductivity: The disclosed steel alloy has a good conductivity and, in a<br>
SOFC setup, have an ASR of less than 50 m? cm2 after 1000 hours,<br>
preferably an ASR even lower that 25 m? cm2 after 1000 hours, on both<br>
anode and cathode side of the interconnect. Moreover, the increment of the<br>
ASR is not greater than 10 m? cm2 per 1000 hours, preferably even lower<br>
than 5 m? cm2 per 1000 hours on both the anode and the cathode side of<br>
the interconnect. This factor promotes a good efficiency of the fuel cell<br>
throughout the life time of the fuel cell, which might be as long as 40 000<br>
hours.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the disclosed steel alloy will now be<br>
described in more detail. First, the steel alloy is produced by ordinary<br>
metallurgical steel making routines to the chemical composition as<br>
described, for example, in the following Examples. Then said steel alloy is<br>
hot-rolled down to an intermediate size, and thereafter cold-rolled in several<br>
steps with a number of recrystallization steps, until a final specific thickness<br>
of normally less than 3 mm, and a width of maximally 400 mm. The linear<br>
thermal expansion of said steel alloy was determined by dilatometer<br>
measurement and was found to be 12.3-10-6 °C-1 for the temperature range<br>
30 to 900°C.<br>
Example 1: A 0.2 mm thick steel alloy strip with a nominal composition (by<br>
weight) of max 0.2 % C, max 0.1 % N, max 0.1 % O, max 0.4 % Si, max 0.5<br>
% Al, max 0.5 % Mn, 20 to 25 % Cr, max 2.0 % Ni, 0,001 to 0.1 % Zr + Hf,<br>
max 0.5 % Ti, max 2.5 % Mo +W, max 0.5 % V, max 1.25 % Nb +Ta and<br>
balance of Fe (with naturally occurring impurities) was produced by an<br>
ordinary steel making process, followed by hot-rolling down to a thickness of<br>
less than 4 mm. Thereafter, it was cold-rolled in several steps with a number<br>
of recrystallization steps down to a final thickness of 0.2 mm. Strips of four<br>
other steel alloys were produced in the same way for comparison with the<br>
steel alloy of Example 1. The compositions of these additional steel alloys<br>
and their Sandvik identity numbers are given in Table 2.<br>
Coupons of the five steel alloy strips with the size 70 x 30 x 0.2 mm<br>
were oxidized in air at 850°C for 336, 672 and 1008 hours, respectively. In<br>
Figure 1, the mass gain per unit area is plotted as a function of time for the<br>
five steel alloys. According to Figure 1, a mass gain of less than 1.1 mg/cm2<br>
per 1000 hours is obtained for the steel alloy of Example 1, insuring a good<br>
high temperature corrosion resistance and a lower growth rate of the formed<br>
oxide scale. However, for the steel alloys made for comparison (Sandvik ID<br>
numbers 433, 436 and 437) with a Mn content of 0.5% (by weight) and the<br>
addition of rare earth metals in the form of Ce, all showed a mass gain of<br>
more than 1.8 mg/cm2 per 1000 hours, and the steel alloy with a Mn content<br>
of 5% (by weight) had a mass gain of almost 5 mg/cm2 per 1000 hours. The<br>
extreme large weight gain for steel alloy with 5% Mn (Sandvik ID number<br>
434) shows the importance of good monitoring of the Mn content in the alloy<br>
to avoid high temperature corrosion. A conclusion to be drawn from this is<br>
that the Mn content in the steel alloy should be carefully monitored and low<br>
amounts of Mn as alloying element is preferred if good high temperature<br>
corrosion resistance is to be obtained.<br>
In Figure 2, a cross sectional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)<br>
micrograph of the formed oxide scale after 336 hours at 850°C in air on the<br>
steel alloy of Example 1 is shown. In Figure 2, it can be seen that the<br>
formed oxide scale is also well adherent to the underlying steel alloy and that<br>
the oxide scale thickness is less than 3 urn.<br>
The chemical composition of the formed oxide scale after oxidization<br>
in air for 336 hours at 850°C was determined by Glow Discharge Optical<br>
Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES). In Figure 3, the GDOES depth profile for<br>
the formed oxide scale is shown. The different scales for different elements<br>
should be noted. In Figure 3, it can be seen that the manganese content in<br>
the formed oxide scale increases at the surface to about 12% by weight.<br>
The thickness of this manganese-rich oxide scale is about 0.5 µm, followed<br>
by a more chromium-rich oxide scale of approximately less than 2.4 µm.<br>
The formation of a manganese-rich oxide scale at an outermost layer at the<br>
surface is of importance since ternary chromium oxides such as MnCr2O3<br>
are believed to lower the formation of volatile chromium species such as<br>
chromium oxyhyroxides. It can also be seen that the titanium content is<br>
approximately 0.4% by weight in the oxide scale. Finally, it can be noted<br>
that at the interface of the steel alloy and the oxide scale, a region of silicon<br>
oxide is obtained. The formation of silicon oxide should be kept as low as<br>
possible but is unavoidable if the steel is alloyed or has small residuals of<br>
silicon in the matrix. However, as long as the formation of insulating silicon<br>
oxide at the steel interface is only as small islands of particles, and not as a<br>
continuous layer, it is acceptable for the performance of the fuel cell. X-ray<br>
diffraction of the oxidized coupon showed that the oxides formed in the scale<br>
had both spinell (MCr2O3) and corundum (M2O3) types of structures.<br>
Example 2: As an additional example of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
disclosed steel alloy, coupons of the final steel alloy strip with the sizes of<br>
approximately 30 x 40 x 0.057 mm were oxidized in air at both 750°C and<br>
850°C for 500 and 1000 hours, respectively. In Table 3, a summary of<br>
oxidization results of the four samples together with the exact coupon sizes<br>
of the initial samples is given. The result at 750°C showed a very low mass<br>
gain per unit area, lower than 0.2 mg/cm2 after 500 hours of oxidization and<br>
the mass gain did not increase greatly after 1000 hours. Instead, it was still<br>
lower than 0.3 mg/cm2 after 1000 hours. For the two sample oxidized at<br>
850°C, the mass gain per unit area was larger but still low, less than 1.1<br>
mg/cm2, which was also the result for the thicker strip (0.2 mm) samples,<br>
oxidized in Example 1.<br>
The low mass gains observed in both Examples 1 and 2 above were<br>
compared with published values of mass gain attained on other<br>
commercially available steels, and other test melts. In Table 4, values as<br>
obtained from the literature on other steel grades together with the values<br>
obtained in the present study have been summarized for comparison with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Table 4, it can be seen that the<br>
weight gain of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed steel alloy is low<br>
compared to other commercially available steel grades. For instance, it has<br>
been reported that the commercialty.available steel ZMG232 has a weight<br>
gain of approximately 0.5 mg/cm2, already after 100 hours exposure of air at<br>
850°C. The same alloy when exposed to air +1% H2O mixture for only 670<br>
hours at 850°C has an even larger weight gain of 1.54 mg/cm2.<br>
Example 3: As a third example, coupons of exemplary embodiments of the<br>
disclosed steel alloy and the four test melts (Sandvik ID numbers 433, 434,<br>
436 and 437) described in Example 1 and the Sandvik 0C44 alloy, were<br>
oxidized together with coupons of two commercially available steel grades<br>
designed for the use as interconnects in SOFC, alloy A and alloy B at 850°C<br>
in air + 1% H2O for 500 hours. In Figure 4, the weight gain for the different<br>
steel grades after oxidation at 850°C in air + 1% H2O is shown. In Figure 4,<br>
it can be seen that the exemplary embodiments of the disclosed steel alloy<br>
have a much lower weight gain compared with the four Sandvik test melts,<br>
and also have a much lower weight gain than the two commercially available<br>
steel grades. In this context, a low weight gain is equal to a good high<br>
temperature corrosion resistance. The second lowest weight gain is<br>
obtained by the Sandvik 0C44 alloy with the nominal composition (by weight)<br>
of max 0.018% C, max 0.025% N, max 0.5% Si, max 0.35% Mn, 21.1 to<br>
21.8% Cr, max 0.3% Ni, max 0.02% P, max 0.007% S, max 0.15% Mo, max<br>
0.010% Ti, max 0.01% Nb, max 0.03 % Ce, max 0.015% Mg and balance of<br>
Fe (with naturally occurring impurities). As seen in Example 1, the steel<br>
alloy Sandvik ID number 434 with a high Mn content has the largest weight<br>
gain almost 3 mg/cm2 after 500 hours of exposure. The commercial<br>
available alloy B with a composition of (by weight) C = 0.02%, Si = 0.40%,<br>
Mn = 0.50%, Ni = 0.26%, Cr = 21.97% Al = 0.21%, Zr = 0.22%, La = 0.04%<br>
and balance of Fe according to reference "Development of Ferritic Fe-Cr<br>
Alloy for SOFC separator", T. Uehara, T. Ohno &amp; A. Toji, Proceedings Fifth<br>
European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum, Lucerne, Switzerland, edited by J.<br>
Huijsmans (2002) p. 281, has the second largest weight gain of almost 2.5<br>
mg/cm2 after 500 hours of exposure. The three other Sandvik steel alloys<br>
ID#433,436 and 437 with only 0.5% by weight Mn and the commercial<br>
available alloy A with a nominal composition of (by weight) Cr 21.0 to 24.0%,<br>
C max 0.03%, Mn max 0.8%, Si max 0.5%, Cu max 0.5%, Ti max 0.25, P<br>
max 0.05, La max 0.2% and balance of Fe, have weight gains of less than 1<br>
mg/cm2, but still much higher than exemplary embodiments of the disclosed<br>
steel alloy and the Sandvik 0C44 alloy.<br>
Example 4: All the three previous examples have described the excellent<br>
high temperature corrosion resistance of exemplary embodiments of<br>
disclosed steel alloy. In this fourth example, the low electrical resistivity of<br>
the exemplary steel alloys will be exemplified. The contact resistance was<br>
measured in dry air for 2900 hours at 750°C with a temperature peak of<br>
850°C for 10 hours in the beginning. The load of the contact was 1 kg/cm2<br>
at the start and the contact area was 0.5 cm2. The measured area specific<br>
resistance (ASR) was initially, i.e., after the 850°C temperature peak lower<br>
than 15 m? cm2 and had after 2900 hours, including 6 thermal cycles,<br>
increased to below 25 m? cm2. The increment of the ASR with time was<br>
lower than 5 m? cm2 per 1000 hours. If extrapolated linearly, the ASR of the<br>
contact would be less than 200 m? cm2 after 40,000 hours of exposure. It is<br>
important for the fuel cell efficiency that the ASR is low throughout the<br>
lifetime of the fuel cell. Furthermore, when the contact resistance was tested<br>
under anode gas environment, i.e., Ar + 9% H2 at 750°C, the ASR was even<br>
lower, well under 10 m? cm2 after 600 hours of exposure. The increment of<br>
the ASR was very low, under 2 m? cm2 per 1000 hours. If extrapolated<br>
linearly the ASR of the contact on the anode side would be much lower than<br>
200 m? cm2 after 40,000 hours of exposure, even lower than 100 m? cm2<br>
after 40,000 hours of exposure. These values can be compared with the<br>
contact resistance of approximately 26 m? cm2 after exposure of air at<br>
750°C for 1000 hours for the commercially available steel ZMG 232 which<br><br>
