				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel flux useful for hot dip galvanizing of iron and iron based alloys and an improved process therefor using the said flux.<br>
Iron and iron based alloys are hot dip galvanized in molten zinc to provide zinc coating on their surface. Since zinc is anodic to iron and steel, it provides sacrificial protection towards the surface of the latter. For hot dip galvanizing of different type of articles of iron and steels, the following steps are involved:<br>
(i)   Pickling,<br>
(ii)  Rinsing,<br>
(iii) Fluxing,<br>
(iv)  Drying and<br>
(v)   Hot dip galvanizing<br>
The present invention describes the synthesis and use of the * novel flux-(triple salt flux) used in hot dip galvanizing process. The fluxing ofthe surface to be galvanized enables it to get rid of oxides of iron present on the surface. These oxides if present on the surface create problems such as black spots on galvanized materials, dross formation, etc.<br>
The fluxing is achieved in two ways:<br>
(a)	Dry fluxing:  Where the article to  be  galvanized  is<br>
treated in the  solution of flux prior to their  immersion in<br>
the molten zinc bath and<br>
(b)	Wet fluxing: Where the surface to be galvanized is  fluxed<br>
insitu into the molten zinc bath itself.<br>
The hitherto known processes for the  fluxing  is  the<br><br>
use of a mixture of zinc chloride and ammonium .chloride in dry<br>
fluxing and ammonium chloride in wet fluxing. These known<br>
processes are, however, associated with a number of drawbacks<br>
such as:	'	....;.<br>
(a)	They are extremely corrosive towards the steel articles,<br>
(b)	Dross formation is very high,<br><br>
(c)	Pollution  problems  are  encountered  due   to ' :  the<br>
decomposition  of  ammonium chloride to form  ammonia  and<br>
hydrochloric acid     fumes and	.<br>
(d)	Black spots appear due to  improper fluxing ie.uncleahed<br>
oxide on the surface.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel flux useful for hot dip galvanizing o*f iron and iron based alloys.<br>
Another object  is to provide an improved process for hot dip<br>
•galvanising using the said flux which obviates the above men<br>
tioned drawbacks.		<br>
In the process of the present invention, a thin coating of<br>
iron-zinc-ammonium chloride is formed on the articles to<br>
be galvanized when they are dipped in the appropriate concen<br>
tration of novel flux consisting of triple salt dissolved in<br>
the water.	:<br>
The triple salt is prepared by reaction of zinc chloride and ammonium chloride in an appropriate molecular ratio, tempera--ture and time. The triple salt is crystallized, filtered and used as flux at an appropriate concentration.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a novel flux useful for hot dip galvanizing of iron and iron based alloys which comprises:<br>
(i)       Preparing 5 - 50% aqueous solution of zinc chloride and heating to a<br>
temperature in the range of 80 to 115°C. (ii)       Preparing 10 - 50% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and<br>
heating to a temperature in the range of 80 to 115°C, (iii)      Mixing the solutions resulting from step (i) and  (ii) above under<br>
constant stirring while maintaining the temperature under constant<br>
stirring while maintaining the temperature in the range of 70 to 110°C<br>
for a period of 30 to 150 minutes, (iv)     evaporating the solution obtained in step (iii) to raise gravity and effect<br>
solidification of the reacted product, cooling the solution to room<br>
temperature for separating resultant flux from the unreacted salts. According to a feature of invention the chloride of zinc and ammonia may be either laboratory reagent grade or commercial grade, but free from impurities such as iron.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides an improved process for hot dip galvanizing using the said novel flux which comprises: (i) Preparing a bath of 15 to 20% aqueous solution of the novel flux prepared by the process as described above raising the<br><br>
temperature of the flux solutions in the temperature      range<br>
o of 40 to 110 C,<br>
(ii) Dipping the metal substrate to be galvanized in the said bath for a period- in the range of of 30 to 300 seconds,<br>
(iii) Drying the fluxed metal substrate with hot air and<br>
(iv) Galvanizing the articles in molten zinc bath by known methods.<br>
By the process of the present invention , galvanizing of  iron<br>
and<br>
iron  based  alloys  is  achieved   having   reduced   iron<br>
based alloy dross generation(  lOto 50%),galvanized  coating<br>
of high adherence and least pollution to the atmosphere.<br>
The 'following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of investigation:<br>
Example 1<br>
A solution of zinc chloride containing 200 gms/lit of zinc chloride was prepared and heated to 100 C. Another solution of ammoniumchloride having 800 gms/lit was prepared and also heated to 100 C. Both these solutions were mixed in hot conditions under constant stirring. The mixed solution was boiled for 15 minutes and cooled to room temperature.<br>
The filtrate was taken and its specific gravity was raised to get the crystals of triple salt. The crystals were analyzed by X-ray diffractometryand the chemical methods.The strong peaks of ZnCl.3 NH Cl were observed in X-ray diffraction pattern. The<br><br>
chemical	analysis   exhibited the following results.<br>
% Zn	22.80<br>
% Cl	60.06<br>
%ZnC12	46.00<br>
% NH4C1	54.00<br>
Example 2<br>
A solution having 300 gms/lit of zinc chloride and 600gms/lit of ammonium chloride was prepared and heated to 110 c.Thistemperature was maintained for 35 minutes. The solution was cooled to roomtemperature and filtrate was evaporated to raise its specific gravity and then cooled to achieve the crystals of Triple-salts.The crystals were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and chemical methods and results were the same as<br>
described in  example 1. f<br>
Example 3<br>
A water solution of 20% of the product prepared as in Examplel was prepared and small mild steel tube coupons (2.5 cm dia,1.0 mm thickness and 15.0 cm length) were treated in this solution for one minute at 80 to 90 C.These coupons were dried and immersed in the bath having molten zinc at 450 C. Following observations were noted:<br>
i)  Evolution of white fumes was 50 to 70% less  compared  to the conventional process;<br>
ii Adherence of the coating evaluated by bend test passed the stipulated standard.<br><br>
(iii) Copper sulphate dip test: passes 12 dips.<br>
Example 4<br>
A water solution having 40 gms/100 ml of the triple salt as prepared in Example II was heated to 100 C and tube specimen of dimensions(2.5 cm dia 1.0 mm thickness and 15.0 cm length) were treated in this solution for 1 minute. They were then dried and dipped in galvanizing bath maintained at 450 C. The following observations were noted:<br>
(i)  The  white fumes evolution was less by 50-70%  compared to conventional bath;<br>
(ii) Adherence ofthe coating passed the standard tests of adherence .<br>
(iii) Copper sulphate dip test: Passed 12 dips. Corrosion Studies:<br>
i Mild steel coupons of size 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm were  immersed in the<br>
solution prepared by this invention and also in the solution conventionally prepared,for 6 hours maintaining the temperature of the bath to 70 C. Following results were obtained:<br>
FLux	Corrosion Rate<br>
(mpy)<br>
Triple salt based flux42<br>
as prepared by the present<br>
invention<br>
Conventional  flux	81<br>
These  figures  indicate that the novel flux based on triple salt are less corrosive.<br><br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
(i) The present invention reduces the pollution problems compared to conventional fluxes by 50-70%.<br>
(ii)  It is 50% less  corrosive  than the conventional<br>
fluxes. This is expected to reduce dross formation;<br>
(iii) Coating is very adherent to the steel surface;<br>
(iv) It can be operated at 30 to 40% lower concentrations compared to the conventional fluxes, in the bath leading to saving in space for storage of the chemicals and reduced hazard-ness due to the handling of diluted solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
