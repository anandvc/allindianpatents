				<td>A METHOD FOR GENERATING A COLLECTION OF CELLS SUITABLE AS A RECOMBINANT<br>
POLYCLONAL MANUFACTURING CELL LINE<br>
FIELD OF-THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention forms the basis of a technology platform for producing recombinant<br>
polyclonal proteins, such as proteins from the immunoglobulin superfamlly, e.g. soluble or<br>
membrane-bound forms of B or T eel! receptors, to be used as a new class of therapeutic in<br>
the treatment, amelioration or prevention of various infections, inflammatory diseases,<br>
transplantation rejection, cancer, and allergies.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of infectious diseases and cancers lacks efficient therapies. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
have generally not been successful against these targets, partly due to variability of the complex<br>
targets and adaptive mutations of target proteins causing Immune escape from monoclonal<br>
antibody recognition. Polyclonal antibodies on the other hand are able to target a plurality<br>
of dynamic targets, e.g., on viruses or cancer cells. Also, polyclonal antibodies have the<br>
highest probability of retaining activity in the event of antlgenic-mutation.<br>
Different commercially available polyclonal anybody therapeutics exist including: 1) normal<br>
human immunoglobulin isolated from the blood of normal human donors; 2) human hyper-<br>
immune immunoglobulln derived from the blood of individual human donors carrying antibodies<br>
against a particular disease target, e.g., a virus, which they previously have encountered<br>
either through infection or vaccination; and 3) animal hyperimmune immunoglobulin<br>
derived from the blood of Immunized animals.<br>
Immunoglobulin purified from human biood has proved effective against infections with<br>
hepatitis B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus and other herpes viruses, rabies<br>
virus, botulinum toxin, etc, as well as in the neonatal rhesus D prophylaxis. Immunoglobulin<br>
purified from the blood of rabbits immunized with human T cells is used to afford T<br>
cell immunosuppression in the treatment or prevention of transplant rejection (e.g., Thymo-<br>
globulin). Normal human immunoglobulin has been utilized to boost the immune system of<br>
immunodeficient patients, as well as in the therapy of various autoimmune disorders.<br>
Nevertheless, widespread immunoglobulin use has been limited due to the constrained supply<br>
of donor blood raw material, problems with batch-to-batch variations, and variable safety.<br>
Animal-derived immunoglobulins in particular are faced with the same problems of immuno-<br>
genicity as was observed for animal-derived monoclonal antibodies in the 1980s and 1990s.<br>
Finally, as with other blood products, the risk of transmission of infectious agents such as<br>
HIV, herpes or hepatitis viruses or prions remains. Accordingly, while clinicians acknowledge<br>
that poiyclonal antibodies are a preferred therapeutic in some situations, their use has been<br>
very limited.<br>
New approaches to generate human immunoglobullns arose with the transgenic animal techniques.<br>
Transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin loci have been created (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,111,166). These mice produce fully human Immunoglobullns, and antibodies against a<br>
specific target can be raised by usual immunization techniques. However, larger antibody<br>
yields are limited because of the relatively small size of mice. Larger animals have also been<br>
made transgenic for the human immunoglobulin genes, e.g., cows, sheep, rabbits, and chickens<br>
(Kuroiwa, Y. etal. Nature Biotechnology, 2002; 20: 889-893). However, producing poly<br>
clonal antibodies for therapy from the blood of such animals is not without complications.<br>
First, the immunophyslology of the animal and humans may display considerable differences,<br>
causing a difference in the resulting immune repertoire, functional rearrangement, and diversity<br>
of the antibody response. Second, mitotic instability of the introduced immunoglobulin<br>
loci might influence the long-term production of antibodies. Third, it is technically challenging<br>
to delete the animal's own immunoglobulin loci so that e.g., the animal antibody pro-<br>
duction will not exceed the production of human antibody. Fourth, the risk of transmission of<br>
infectious agents such as viruses, prions or other pathogens accompanies the administration<br>
of human antibodies produced in animals.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for manufacturing technologies for producing recombinant polyclonal<br>
proteins, such as antibodies, in sufficiently large amounts and with minimal batch-to-<br>
batch variations for safe clinical uses. Efficient methods for manufacturing homogenous recombinant<br>
proteins using eukaryotlc (in particular mammalian) expression cell lines have<br>
been developed for the production of a variety of proteins including monoclonal antibodies,<br>
interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor, coagulation factors VII, VIII and IX. Many of<br>
these techniques are based on transfectlon and random integration of the gene of interest<br>
into the genome of the expression cell line followed by selection, amplification, and characterization<br>
of a high-producer expression clone and propagation of this clone as a master ex-<br>
pression cell line.<br>
The expression of an inserted foreign gene may be influenced by "position effects" from surrounding<br>
genomic DNA. in many cases, the gene Is inserted into sites where the position<br>
effects are strong enough to inhibit the synthesis of the product of the introduced gene. Furthermore,<br>
the expression is often unstable due to silencing mechanisms (i.e. methylation)<br>
imposed by the surrounding chromosomal host DNA.<br>
Systems allowing integration and expression of a gene of interest in mammalian cells at a<br>
specific genomic location have been developed for the expression of a homogenous recombi-<br>
nant protein composition (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,959,317 and 5,654,182; WO 98/41645; WO<br>
01/07572). WO 98/41645 describes the site-spectfic integration for production of a mammalian<br>
cell line that secretes, for example, antibody. However, this expression is monoclonal<br>
and there is no indication that transfectlons could be done with a library of vectors. Nor are<br>
there any suggestions how to maintain the original diversity generated by specific VH-VL combinations<br>
in a library.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF CONTRIBUTION<br>
The present invention provides solutions for generating a manufacturing cell line for expression<br>
and production of a recombinant polyclonal protein, avoiding significant bias among the<br>
individual members constituting the polyclonal protein.<br>
Further, the present invention does not utilize animals in the polyclonal protein production,<br>
thereby obviating the ethical and clinical difficulties associated with such approaches.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for producing a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing<br>
cell line for the production of a recombinant polyclonal protein, often selected from the<br>
immunoglobulln superfamily. Especially the production of polyclonal antibodies, polyclonal T<br>
cell receptors or polyclonal fragments thereof are of interest. The present invention allows for<br>
the commercial production of a recombinant polyclonal protein for use in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. One important feature of the invention is that during the manufacturing process<br>
biased expression of the individual molecules constituting the polyclonal protein is kept<br>
to a non-significant level, minimizing unwanted batch-to-batch variation.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a recombinant<br>
polyclonal protein of interest, wherein said polyclonal protein comprises (or consists of) distinct<br>
members that bind a particular antigen, said method comprising: a) providing a collection<br>
of cells comprising a library of variant nucleic acid sequences, where each of said nucleic<br>
acid sequences encodes a distinct member of said polyclonal protein and where each of said<br>
nucleic acid sequences are integrated at the same, single site of the genome of each individual<br>
cell in said collection of cells; b) culturing said collection of cells under conditions facilitating<br>
expression of said polyclonal protein; and c) recovering said expressed polyclonal<br>
protein from the cell culture, cell fraction or cell culture medium.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method for generating a collection of<br>
cells suitable as ajrecombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line, said method comprising: a)<br>
providing a library of vectors comprising a population of variant nucleic acid sequences,<br>
wherein each of said vectors comprises 1) one single copy of a distinct nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding a distinct member of a polyclonal protein comprising (or consisting of) distinct<br>
members that bind a particular antigen and 2) one or more recomblnase recognition sequences;<br>
b) introducing said library of vectors into a host cell line, wherein the genome of each<br>
individual cell of said host cell line comprises recombinase recognition sequences, matching<br>
those of the vector, at a single specific site in Its genome; c) ensuring the presence in said<br>
cells of one or more recombinases so that the variant nucleic add sequences of step (a) are<br>
integrated site-specifically in the cells of the host cell line, where said one or more recombinases<br>
is/are either I) expressed by said cells into which said nucleic acid sequence is introduced;<br>
ii) operatively encoded by the vectors of step a; ill) provided through expression from<br>
a second vector; or Iv) provided to the cell as a protein; and d) selecting cells comprising an<br>
integrated copy from said library of variant nucleic acid sequences.<br>
in both methods of the invention, it will be understood that the polyclonal protein normally is<br>
one that is not naturally associated with the cells wherein expression is effected.<br>
The present invention describes several methods by which a library of variant nucleic add<br>
sequences can be introduced into a host cell line in order to generate a collection of cells<br>
suitable as polyclonal manufacturing cell line. These methods include bulk transfection of a<br>
collection of cells with the library, semi-bulk transfection of aliquots of cells with fractions of<br>
the library or individual transfection where host cells are transfected with individual members<br>
of the library followed by pooling of the clones generated upon selection. Preferably the present<br>
invention utilizes mammalian cells (cell lines or cell types) as host cell line.<br>
in one aspect of the invention, the individual members of a polyclonal protein are encoded<br>
from pairs of independent gene segments. Polyclonal proteins, where the individual members<br>
are comprised of two polypeptide chains, include soluble or membrane-bound forms of antibodies<br>
and T cell receptors. in further embodiments of the present invention a pair of gene<br>
segments encode an antibody heavy chain and light chain variable region, or a T cell receptor<br>
alpha chain and beta chain variable region or a T cell receptor gamma chain and delta chain<br>
variable region.<br>
The present invention further provides a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line<br>
comprising a collection of cells transfected with a library of variant nucleic acid sequences,<br>
wherein each cell in the collection is transfected with and capable of expressing one member<br>
of the library, which encodes a distinct member of a polyclonal protein that binds a particular<br>
antigen and which is located at the same single site in the genome of individual cells in said<br>
collection, wherein said nucleic acid sequence is not naturally associated with said cell in the<br>
collection. The cell line preferably originates from a mammalian cell line such as Chinese<br>
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, COS cells, BHK cells, myeloma cells (e.g., Sp2/0 cells, NSO),<br>
YB2/0, NIH 3T3, fibroblast or Immortalized human cells such as Heia cells, HEK 293 cells, or<br>
PER.C6. However, non-mammalian eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, such as plant cells, insect<br>
cells, yeast cells, bacteria, fungi etc., can also be used.<br>
Also embraced by the present invention Is a library of vectors for stte-spedfic integration<br>
comprising a population of naturally occurring variant nucleic acid sequences, wherein each<br>
of said vectors comprises 1) one copy of a distinct nucleic acid sequence encoding a distinct<br>
member of a poly dona I protein that binds a particular antigen and 2) one or more recombinase<br>
recognition sequences.<br>
in another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an<br>
active ingredient, a recombinant polyclonal antibody (or fragment thereof) or poiyclonal T cell<br>
receptor (or fragment thereof), preferably obtained by the methods of the invention. The<br>
recombinant polyclonal protein of the composition Is specific for or reactive against a predetermined<br>
disease target. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be used for the treatment,<br>
amelioration or prevention of diseases such as cancer, infections, inflammatory diseases,<br>
allergy, asthma and other respiratory diseases, autoimmune diseases, immunological malfunctions,<br>
cardiovascular diseases, diseases in the central nervous system, metabolic and<br>
endocrine diseases, transplant rejection, or undesired pregnancy, in a mammal such as a<br>
human, a domestic animal, or a pet.<br>
Definitions<br>
By "protein" or "polypeptide" is meant any chain of amino acids, regardless of length or post-<br>
translational modification. Proteins can exist as monomers or multimers, comprising two or<br>
more assembled polypeptide chains, fragments of proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptldes, or<br>
peptides.<br>
As used herein, the term "polyclonal protein" or "polyclonality" refers to a protein composition<br>
comprising different, but homologous protein molecules, preferably selected from the<br>
i immunoglobulin superfamily. Thus, each protein molecule is homologous to the other molecules<br>
of the composition, but also contains one or more stretches of variable polypeptide<br>
sequence, which is/are characterized by differences in the amino acid sequence between the<br>
individual members of the polyclonal protein. Known examples of such polyclonal proteins<br>
include antibody or immunoglobulin molecules, T cell receptors and B cell receptors. A poly-<br>
donal protein may consist of a defined subset of protein molecules, which has been defined<br>
by a common feature such as the shared binding activity towards a desired target, e.g., in<br>
the case~bf a polyclonal antibody against the desired target antigen.<br>
The term ""polyclonal protein of interest" covers a defined polyclonal protein subset, which<br>
shares a common feature, such as binding activity towards a desired target, e.g., in the case<br>
of polyclonal antibodies described by the binding activity or specificity against the target antigen,<br>
said antigen being one or more of e.g., separate proteins, microorganisms, parasites,<br>
cell types, allergens, or carbohydrate molecules, or any other structures, molecules, or substances,<br>
which may be the target of specific antibody binding, or mixtures of said antigens.<br>
The terms "one member of a recombinant polyclonal protein composition" or "one member of<br>
a recombinant polyclonal protein" denote one protein molecule of a protein composition comprising<br>
different, but homologous protein molecules, where each protein molecule Is homologous<br>
to the other molecules of the composition, but also contains one or more stretches of<br>
variable polypeptide sequence, which is/are characterized by differences in the amino acid<br>
sequence between the individual members of the polyclonal protein.<br>
The terms "variable polypeptide sequence" and 'variable region" are used interchangeably.<br>
The terms "a distinct member of a recombinant polyclonal protein" denotes one protein molecule<br>
of a protein composition comprising different, but homologous protein molecules, where<br>
each protein molecule is homologous to the other molecules of the composition, but also<br>
contains one or more stretches of variable polypeptide sequence, which is/are characterized<br>
by differences in the amino acid sequence between the individual members of the polyclonal<br>
protein.<br>
The term "antibody" describes a functional component of serum and is often referred to either<br>
as a collection of molecules (antibodies or immunoglobulin) or as one molecule (the an-<br>
tibody molecule or immunoglobulin molecule). An antibody molecule is capable of binding to<br>
or reacting with a specific antigenic determinant (the antigen or the antigenic epitope), which<br>
in turn may lead to induction of immunological effector mechanisms. An individual antibody<br>
molecule is usually regarded as monospecific, and a composition of antibody molecules may<br>
be monoclonal (I.e., consisting of identical antibody molecules) or polyclonal (i.e., consisting<br>
of different antibody molecules reacting with the same or different epitopes on the same antigen<br>
or even on distinct, different antigens). Each antibody molecule has a unique structure<br>
that enables it to bind specifically to its corresponding antigen, and all natural antibody molecules<br>
have the same overall basic structure of two identical light chains and two Identical<br>
heavy chains. Antibodies are also known collectively as immunoglobulins. The terms antibody<br>
or antibodies as used herein are also intended to indude chimeric and single chain antibodles,<br>
as well as binding fragments of antibodies, such as Fab, Fv fragments or scFv fragments,<br>
as well as multimeric forms such as dimeric IgA molecules or pentavalent IgM.<br>
The term "polyclonal antibody" describes a composition of different antibody molecules which<br>
is capable of binding to or reacting with several different specific antigenlc determinants on<br>
the same or on different antigens. Usually, the variability of a polyclonal antibody is thought<br>
to be located in the so-called variable regions of the polyclonal antibody. However, in the<br>
context of the present invention, polyclonallty can also be understood to describe differences<br>
between the individual antibody molecules residing in so-called constant regions, e.g., as in<br>
the case of mixtures of antibodies containing two or more antibody Isotypes such as the human<br>
isotypes IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2, or the murine isotypes IgGl, IgG2a,<br>
IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA.<br>
A "recombinant polyclonal antibody of interest" describes a defined recombinant polyclonal<br>
antibody subset, which is characterized by the ability to bind to a desired target or desired<br>
set of targets, said targets being e.g., a separate protein, a microorganism, a parasite, a cell,<br>
an allergen, or a carbohydrate molecule, or another structure, molecule, or substance which<br>
may be the target of specific antibody binding, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The term "immunoglobulin" commonly is used as a collective designation of the mixture of<br>
antibodies found in blood or serum, but may also be used to designate a mixture of antibodies<br>
derived from other sources.<br>
The term "immunoglobulin molecule" denotes an individual antibody molecule, e.g., as being<br>
a part of immunoglobulin, or part of any polyclonal or monoclonal antibody composition.<br>
When stating that a member of a polyclonal protein binds to an antigen, it is herein meant a<br>
binding having binding constant that is below 1 mM, preferably below 100 nM, even more<br>
i preferred below 10 nM.<br>
The term "a library of variant nucleic acid molecules of interest" is used to describe the collection<br>
of nucleic acid molecules, which collectively encode a "recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
of interest". When used for transfection, the library of variant nucleic acid molecules of interest<br>
is contained in a library of expression vectors. Such a library typically have at least 3, 5,<br>
10, 20, 50, 1000,10", 105 or 106 distinct members.<br>
As used herein the terms "one copy of a distinct nucleic acid sequence of interest" are not to<br>
be taken literally as a single stretch of nucleic acids corresponding to a single gene segment,<br>
but rather as one copy of all the gene segments required to produce all the subunlts of one<br>
molecule of the protein of interest, and assembled into one nucleic add molecule such as e.g.<br>
a vector. Some examples, where more than one gene segment usually is required to give rise<br>
to a complete molecule of a protein of interest include B cell receptors, antibodies and fragments<br>
of antibodies such as Fab's and variable domains, or T cell receptors. When introduced<br>
into the cell, the gene segments, which together encode the fully assembled protein of interest,<br>
reside in the same vector, thus being linked together in one nucleic add sequence, possibly<br>
as separate transcriptlonal elements under control of different promoters.<br>
The term "a gene of interest" as used herein, refer to a nucleic acid sequence composed of<br>
one or more gene segments (genomic or cDNA) that encode one member of a protein of interest.<br>
The plural form "genes of interest" refers to a library of nucleic acid sequences encoding<br>
a polyclonal protein of interest. The term "601" is used as an abbreviation of (a)<br>
gene(s) of interest.<br>
As used herein, the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule into which a nucleic acid<br>
sequence can be inserted for transport between different genetic environments and/or for<br>
expression in a host cell. A vector capable of integrating into the genome of a host cell at a<br>
pre-determined, specific locus in the genome is herein named "a vector for site-specific integration".<br>
If the vector carries regulatory elements for transcription of the nucleic add sequence<br>
inserted in the vector (at least a suitable promoter), the vector is herein called "an<br>
expression vector". If the expression vector is capable of integrating at a pre-determined,<br>
specific locus in the genome of the host cell, the expression vector may be called "an expression<br>
vector for site-specific integration". If the nucleic acid sequence inserted into the above<br>
identified vectors encodes a protein of interest as herein defined, the following terms are<br>
used "vector of interest", "vector of interest for site-specific integration", "expression vector<br>
of interest" and "expression vector of interest for site-specific integration". The term "an iso-<br>
type-encoding vector" refers to a vector carrying nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody<br>
isotype. in the present specification, "phagemid vector" and "phage vector" are used<br>
interchangeably. The terms "plasmid" and "vector" are used interchangeably. The invention is<br>
intended to include such other forms of vectors, which serve equivalent functions for example<br>
plasmids, phagemids and virus genomes or any nucleic acid molecules capable of directing<br>
the production of a desired protein in a proper host.<br>
The term "each member of the library of vectors of interest" is used to describe individual<br>
vector molecules with a distinct nucleic acid sequence derived from a library of vectors of<br>
interest, where the nucleic acid sequence encodes for one member of the recombinant poly-<br>
clonal protein of interest.<br>
The term "mass transfer" is used to describe the transfer of nucleic add sequences of interest<br>
from one population of vectors to another population of vectors and doing so for each DNA<br>
simultaneously without resorting to isolation of the individual DNA's of interest. Such populations<br>
of vectors can be libraries containing for example variable regions, promoters, leaders<br>
or enhancing elements of interest. These sequences can then be moved without prior isolation<br>
from for example a phage vector to a mammalian expression vector. Especially for antibody<br>
sequences this technique ensures that the linkage between VH and VL diversity is not<br>
lost while moving libraries from, for example, a selection vector (e.g., a phage display vector)<br>
to a mammalian expression vector. Hereby the original pairing of VH and VL is retained.<br>
The term "transfectlon" is herein used as a broad term for introducing foreign DNA into a cell.<br>
The term is also meant to cover other functional equivalent methods for introducing foreign<br>
DNA into a cell, such as e.g., transformation, infection, transductlon or fusion of a donor cell<br>
and an acceptor cell.<br>
The term "selection" is used to describe a method where cells have acquired a certain characteristic<br>
that enable the isolation from cells that have not acquired that characteristic. Such<br>
characteristics can be resistance to a cytotoxic agent or production of an essential nutrient,<br>
enzyme, or color.<br>
The terms "selectable marker gene", "selection marker gene", "selection gene" and "marker<br>
gene" are used to describe a gene encoding a selectable marker (e.g., a gene conferring resistance<br>
against some cytotoxic drug such as certain antibiotics, a gene capable of producing<br>
an essential nutrient which can be depleted from the growth medium, a gene encoding an<br>
enzyme producing analyzable metabolites or a gene encoding a colored protein which for<br>
example can be sorted by FACS ) which is co-introduced into the cells together with the<br>
gene(s) of interest.<br>
The term "recomblnant protein" is used to describe a protein that is expressed from a cell line<br>
transfected with an expression vector comprising the coding sequence of the protein.<br>
As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a segment being linked to another segment<br>
when placed into a functional relationship with the other segment. For example, DNA<br>
encoding a signal sequence is operably linked to DNA encoding a polypeptide if it is ex-<br>
pressed as a leader that participates in the transfer of the polypeptide to the endoplasmic<br>
reticulum. Also, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates<br>
the transcription of the sequence.<br>
The term "a majority of the individual cells" refers to a percentage of the cells such as more<br>
than 80%, preferably more than 85%, more preferably 90%, 95%, or even 99% or higher.<br>
As used herein, the term "genome" is not to be taken literally as the normal complement of<br>
chromosomes present in a cell, but also extra-chromosomal elements that can be introduced<br>
into and maintained in a cell. Such extra-chromosomal elements can include, but are not<br>
limited to, mini-chromosomes, YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), MACs (mouse artificial<br>
chromosomes), or HACs (human artificial chromosomes).<br>
The term "promoter" refers to a region of DNA involved in binding the RNA polymerase to<br>
initiate transcription.<br>
The term "head-to-head promoters" refers to a promoter pair being placed in close proximity<br>
so that transcription of two gene fragments driven by the promoters occurs in opposite directions.<br>
A head-to-head promoter can also be constructed with a stuffer composed of irrelevant<br>
nucleic acids between the two promoters. Such a stuffer fragment can easily contain more<br>
than 500 nucleotides.<br>
An "antibiotic resistance gene" Is a gene encoding a protein that can overcome the inhibitory<br>
or toxic effect that an antibiotic has on a cell ensuring the survival and continued proliferation<br>
of cells in the presence of the antibiotic.<br>
The term "internal ribosome entry site" or "IRES" describes a structure different from the<br>
normal 5' cap-structure on an mRNA. Both structures can be recognized by a ribosome to<br>
initiate scanning for an AUG codon to initiate translation. By using one promoter sequence<br>
and two initiating AUG's, a first and a second polypeptide sequence can be translated from a<br>
single mRNA. Thus, to enable co-translation of a first and a second polynucleotide sequence<br>
from a single bl-cistronic mRNA, the first and second polynucleotide sequence can be tran-<br>
scriptionally fused via a linker sequence including an IRES sequence that enables translation<br>
of the polynucleotide sequence downstream of the IRES sequence. in this case, a transcribed<br>
bi-cistronic RNA molecule will be translated from both the capped 5' end and from the internal<br>
IRES sequence of the bi-cistronlc RNA molecule to thereby produce both the first and the<br>
second polypeptide.<br>
The term "indudble expression" is used to describe expression that requires interaction of an<br>
inducer molecule or the release of a co-repressor molecule and a regulatory protein for expression<br>
to take place.<br>
The term "constitutive expression" refers to expression which is not usually inducible.<br>
The term "recombinase" refers to an enzyme that catalyses recombination between two or<br>
more recombination sites. Recombinases useful in the present invention catalyze recombination<br>
at specific recombination sites that are specific nucleic acid sequences recognized by a<br>
particular recombtnase.<br>
The term "scrambling" describes situations where two or more distinct members of a poly-<br>
clonal protein comprised of two different polypeptlde chains, e.g. from the immunoglobulln<br>
superfamily, is expressed from an individual cell. This situation may arise when the individual<br>
cell has integrated, into the genome, more than one pair of gene segments, where each pair<br>
of gene segments encode a distinct member of the polyclona I protein. in such situations unintended<br>
combinations of the polypeptide chains expressed from the gene segments can be<br>
made. These unintended combinations of polypeptide chains might not have any therapeutic<br>
effect.<br>
The term "VH-VL chain scrambling" Is an example of the scrambling defined above. in this<br>
example the VH and VL encoding gene segments constitute a pair of gene segments. The<br>
scrambling occurs when unintended combinations of VH and VL polypeptides are produced<br>
from a cell where two different VH and VL encoding gene segment pairs are integrated into<br>
the same cell. Such a scrambled antibody molecule is not likely to retain the original specificity,<br>
and thus might not have any therapeutic effect.<br>
The term "recombinant polycional manufacturing cell line" refers to a population of protein<br>
expressing cells that are transfected with a library of variant nucleic acid sequences of interest<br>
such that the individual cells, which together constitute the recombinant polycional<br>
manufacturing cell line, carry only one copy of a distinct nucleic acid sequence of interest,<br>
which encodes one member of the recombinant polycional protein of interest, and that each<br>
copy is integrated into the same site of the genome of each cell. The cells constituting the<br>
recombinant polycional manufacturing cell line are selected for their ability to retain the integrated<br>
copy of the distinct nucleic acid sequence of interest, for example by antibiotic selection.<br>
Cells which can constitute such a manufacturing cell line can be for example bacteria,<br>
fungi, eukaryotic cells, such as yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells, especially immortal<br>
mammalian cell lines such as CHO cells, COS ceils, BHK cells, myeloma cells (e.g., Sp2/0<br>
cells, NSO), NIH 3T3, YB2/0 and immortalized human cells, such as HeLa cells, HEK 293 cells,<br>
or PER.C6.<br>
The term "hot spot" as in "hot spot cell line" refers to a pre-established locus of the genome<br>
of the cell that has been selected or generated and characterized for highly efficient transcription<br>
of an integrated nucleic acid sequence of interest upon integration of the expression<br>
vector into that site.<br>
The term "bias" is used to denote the phenomenon during recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
production, wherein the composition of a polyclonal vector, polyclonal cell line, or polyclonal<br>
protein alters over time due to random genetic mutations, differences in proliferation kinetics<br>
between individual cells, differences in expression levels between different expression construct<br>
sequences, or differences in the cloning efficiency of DNA.<br>
The term "RFLP" refers to "restriction fragment length polymorphism", a method whereby the<br>
migratory gel pattern of nucleic acid molecule fragments are analyzed after cleavage with<br>
restriction enzymes.<br>
The term "HDS" refers to a high density screening method where many discrete molecules<br>
are tested in parallel on membranes so that large numbers of test compounds are screened<br>
for a given activity simultaneously.<br>
As used herein, "TaqMan PCR" refers to a PCR assay based on the TaqMan system described<br>
by Holland, P. M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. U.S.A. 88: 7276-7280 (1991).<br>
The term "5' UTR" refers to a 5' untranslated region of the mRNA.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The recomblnant polyclonal protein expression system<br>
The present invention provides methods for the consistent manufacturing of recombinant<br>
polyclonal proteins that are preferably selected from the Immunoglobulln superfamily, a family<br>
of proteins with immunoglobulin-iike domains. Most of the members are involved in cell<br>
surface recognition events. Sequence homology suggests that antibodies, T cell receptors,<br>
MHC molecules, some cell adhesion molecules and cytokines receptors share close homology.<br>
Especially members of this family that contain variable regions are suitable for the generation<br>
of recombinant polyclonal proteins according to the present invention. Such members include<br>
antibodies, membrane bound antibodies (B cell receptors), Fab fragments, Fv fragments,<br>
single chain Fv (scFv) fragments, T cell Receptors (TcRs), soluble TcRs, TcR variable domain<br>
fragments, TcR variable domain fragments linked by a polypeptide linker or other antibody<br>
or TcR derived fragments. in particular, it is contemplated that the present invention will<br>
open up the possibility for large-scale manufacturing and production of a new class of therapeutics<br>
comprising recombinant therapeutic polyclonal antibodies or TcRs.<br>
One of the major advantages of the manufacturing method of the present invention is that all<br>
the members constituting the recombinant polyclonal protein can be produced in between<br>
one and approximately 10 bloreactors or equivalents thereof. Further, the recombinant polyclonal<br>
protein composition can be purified from the reactor as a single preparation without<br>
having to separate the individual members constituting the recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
during the process. in contrast, if one wanted to mimic a recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
composition by mixing purified monoclonal antibodies (as for example proposed in WO<br>
91/16074) it would require the separate manufacturing in a bloreactor, of each antibody to<br>
be included in the composition and most likely the antibodies would be purified individually as<br>
well. Such a production of a monoclonal mixture would be very costly, and time and space<br>
consuming compared to the method of producing recombinant polyclonal antibody or other<br>
polyclonal proteins as described herein. Thus, the method as described in WO 91/16074<br>
would naturally result in a practical limit to the number of monoclonal antibodies that could<br>
be included in such a mixture, most likely below 10, whereas the technology as described<br>
herein generally can produce a polyclonal antibody with as many individual members as desired.<br>
in order to obtain predictable expression of a recombinant polyclonal protein from a recombinant<br>
polyclonal manufacturing cell line, the regulatory properties of the genomic integration<br>
site should be reasonably well understood.<br>
Conventional transfection and recombinant protein expression techniques using random integration<br>
are undesirable for the production of a recombinant polyclonal protein, since the random<br>
nature of the process will cause the number and positions of the integrated nucleic add<br>
sequences to vary from cell to cell. Thus, if recombinant polyclonal protein is produced by<br>
such traditional protocols, it is likely to result in a heterogeneous cell culture with variable<br>
expression rates of individual members of the polyclonal protein, and genetic instability due<br>
to positional effects of the integrated DNA. This will most likely result in a biased expression<br>
of the members constituting the polyclonal protein.<br>
introduction into a predefined genomic site is therefore desirable, this can in principle be<br>
achieved by homologous recombination. However, owing to the dominance of illegitimate<br>
recombination events, homologous recombination is very inefficient.<br>
Moreover, where the polyclonal protein is an antibody or T cell receptor (TcR), another problem<br>
arises with the use of conventional transfection protocols resulting in random integration.<br>
Antibodies and TcRs are encoded from pairs of independent gene segments, the light<br>
and heavy chain encoding sequences for antibodies and the alpha and beta chain or delta and<br>
gamma encoding sequences for TcRs. The polypeptide products from these gene segments<br>
become covalently linked during intracellular processing of the antibody molecule or TcR.<br>
Conventional transfection technology resulting in random integration leads to the introduction<br>
of several copies of different heavy and light chains or alpha and beta chains in the same cell,<br>
which results in random combinations of heavy and light chains, so-called VH-VL chain scram-<br>
bllng or alpha-beta chain scrambling. Consequently, this deteriorates the performance of the<br>
expressed antibodies or TcRs causing loss of affinity and/or specificity, the possible occurrence<br>
of new specificities and/or reduced specific activity.<br>
To circumvent these problems the expression system of the present invention uses site-specific<br>
integration into the genome of the individual host cells The system of the present invention<br>
ensures that a library of vectors of interest comprising the variant nucleic acid sequences<br>
of interest can be inserted into a pre-characterized chromosomal location by a re-<br>
comblnase-mediated cassette exchange procedure, thereby generating a cell line, wherein<br>
the individual cells expresses a single distinct member of the recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
of interest. As described below, multiple integrations might occur in some of the cells constituting<br>
the recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line. This, however, is not considered to<br>
pose a problem as long as a majority of the individual cells express a single distinct member<br>
of the recombinant polyclonal protein.<br>
Recomblnases such as Cre, Flp, beta-recombinase, Gin, Pin, PlnB, PlnD, ft/RS, lambda inte-<br>
grase, or phage C31 integrase can be used. Suitable recomblnases for integration into the<br>
chromosomal location can be provided either (i) by expression from the cell's own genome<br>
into which said nucleic acid sequence is introduced, (ii) by being operatively encoded by the<br>
nucleic acid sequence inserted into the cell, (iii) through expression from a second nucleic<br>
acid molecule, or (iv) as a protein. in a preferred embodiment, the variant nucleic acid sequence<br>
contained in the vector of interest is integrated into a locus that mediates high-level<br>
transcription and expression of the nucleic acid sequence of interest, a so-called "hot spot".<br>
The host cell line used is preferably a mammalian cell line comprising those typically used for<br>
biopharmaceutical protein expression, e.g., CHO cells, COS cells, BHK cells, myeloma cells<br>
(e.g., Sp2/0 cells, NSO), YB2/0, NIH 3T3, and immortalized human cells, such as HeLa cells,<br>
HEK 293 cells, or PER.C6. in the present invention CHO cells were used. However, a person<br>
of ordinary skill in the art would easily be able to substitute CHO cells with other mammalian<br>
cells as described, or even utilize other types of cells, including plant cells, yeast cells, insect<br>
cells, fungi and bacteria. Thus the choice of cell type is not intended to be limiting to the invention.<br>
in a preferred embodiment, mammalian cells containing a pre-characterized hot<br>
spot, mediating high expression levels of the recombinant polyclonal protein of interest are<br>
used for the manufacture.<br>
in a further embodiment of the present invention, variant nucleic acid sequences of interest<br>
are integrated in a site-specific manner utilizing the same chromosomal integration site in the<br>
host cells. Such incorporation into a single specific site minimizes positional effects otherwise<br>
seen with random integration or integration into multiple sites in a genome. Especially, when<br>
expressing polyclonal proteins composed of more than one polypeptide chain it is further<br>
relevant to have a single site, into which the site-specific integration occurs into the genome.<br>
This is due to the fact that if a single cell expresses more than one integrant, scrambling<br>
among subunits Is likely to occur.<br>
in a site-specific integration system, the individual host cells are expressing the same overall<br>
protein structure apart from the differences observed in the variable region of the recombl-<br>
nant polyclonal protein of interest, e.g., the antigen-binding region of antibodies or TcRs.<br>
Therefore, a majority of cells within such a pool of cells should display similar characteristics<br>
with respect to productivity and genetic stability and hence this technology offers the possibility<br>
of a controlled production of a recomblnant polyclonal protein, e.g,, a recomblnant polyclonal<br>
antibody or TcRs.<br>
The recombinant polyclonal protein of the present invention is intended to cover a protein<br>
composition comprising different, but homologous protein molecules, which are naturally<br>
variable, meaning that, in preferred embodiments, the library of variant nucleic acids comprises<br>
a naturally occurring diversity. Thus, each protein molecule is homologous to the other<br>
molecules of the composition, but also contains one or more stretches of variable polypeptide<br>
sequence, which is/are characterized by differences in the amino add sequence between the<br>
individual members of the polyclonal protein. The differences in the amino acid sequence(s)<br>
that constitute the variable polypeptide sequence might be as little as one amino acid. Preferably<br>
the differences in the amino acid sequence constitute more than one amino acid.<br>
Usually, the natural variability of a polyclonal antibody or TcR is considered to be located in<br>
the so-called variable regions or V-regions of the polypeptide chains.<br>
in one aspect of the present invention individual members in a polyclonal protein comprise<br>
variable regions that are approximately between 80 and 120 amino acids long. The variable<br>
regions might contain hyper-variable domains, e.g. complementarity determining regions<br>
(CDR).<br>
in naturally occurring TcRs there are four CDRs in each variable region. in natural occuring<br>
antibodies there are three CDRs in the heavy chain and three CDRs in the light chain.<br>
in an additional aspect of the present invention the variable regions of the individual mem-<br>
bers of a polyclonal protein contain at least one hyper-variable domain that is between 1 and<br>
26 amino acids long, preferably between 4 and 16 amino acids long. This hyper-variable domain<br>
can correspond to a CDR3 region. For antibodies each variable region preferably constitute<br>
three hyper-variable domains. These can correspond to CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3. For<br>
TcRs each variable region preferably constitutes four hyper-variable domains. These can<br>
correspond to CDR1, CDR2, CDR3 and CDR4. The hyper-variable domains might alone constitute<br>
the variable sequences within a variable region of a recombinant polyclonal protein of<br>
the present invention.<br>
in the context of the present invention, variability in the polypeptlde sequence (the polyclonality)<br>
can also be understood to describe differences between the individual antibody molecules<br>
residing in so-called constant regions or C regions of the antibody polypeptlde chains,<br>
e.g., as in the case of mixtures of antibodies containing two or more different antibody isotopes,<br>
such as the human isotypes IgGl, IgG2, lgG3, Ig.G4, IgAl, and IgA2, or the murine<br>
isotypes IgGl, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA. Thus, a recombinant polyclonal antibody may<br>
comprise antibody molecules that are characterized by sequence differences between the<br>
individual antibody molecules in the variable region (V region) or in the constant region (C<br>
region) or both.<br>
in order to provide variant nucleic acid sequences that encode proteins that bind a particular<br>
antigen, a number of methods known in the art may be utilized. Typically, the invention will<br>
benefit from the use of a screening procedure that enables identification and/or isolation of<br>
nucleic acids that encode protein that bind a particular antigen. Several of these methods<br>
include a so-called biopanning step, known from technologies such as phage display (Rang,<br>
A.S. et al. 1991. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 88, 4363-4366), ribosome display (Schaffitzel, C.<br>

FACS and magnetic bead sorting are also applicable for enrichment (panning) purposes<br>
using labeled antigen. Immunodetection assays such as ELISA (Dreher, M.L et al. 1991. J.<br>

A composition of a recombinant polyclonal protein of interest comprises a defined subset of<br>
proteins, which have been defined by a common feature such as the shared binding activity<br>
towards a desired target, e.g., in the case of polyclonal antibodies against the desired target<br>
antigen. Typically a polyclonal protein composition have at least 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100,<br>
1000,104, 105 or 106 distinct variant members. The number of distinct members needed in<br>
the polyclonal protein composition will depend on the complexity of the target. in the case of<br>
antibodies the complexity of the antigen(s) targeted will influence the number of distinct<br>
variant members necessary in the polyclonal antibody composition. With small or not very<br>
complex targets, for example a small protein, a polyclonal antibody composition that comprises<br>
between 3 to 100 distinct variant members will be sufficient, and It is preferred that<br>
the number of variants does not exceed 90, or even 80 or 70. in many instances, the number<br>
of distinct variants will not exceed 60 or 50, and it is preferred that the number of variants<br>
are in the range between 5 and 40, such as between 5 and 30. Whereas for more complex<br>
targets, for example viruses with complex or interchangeable surface proteins, or encompassing<br>
several virus subtypes, a polyclonal antibody composition that comprises between 20<br>
to 500 distinct variant members will be sufficient. Very complex targets, where the antigen<br>
comprises many different molecules, a polyclonal antibody composition comprising between<br>
50 to 10,000 distinct variant members may be required.<br>
in mammals, there are several known examples of naturally occurring polyclonal proteins<br>
either circulating freely in the blood such as antibodies or immunoglobulln molecules or present<br>
on cell surfaces such as T cell receptors and B cell receptors. The diversity of these<br>
naturally occurring polyclonal proteins are, in some mammals, achieved by genetic recombination<br>
of genes encoding variable regions of these proteins. Antibodies are further known to<br>
increase their diversity by somatic mutation. The present invention can utilize these natural<br>
diversities by isolating the sequences responsible for the diversity (e.g., the variable domains<br>
or CDR regions of immunoglobulin molecules orTcRs) and generating a library from them.<br>
For proteins encoded from two independent gene segments, e.g. antibody variable heavy<br>
chain and variable light chain, TcRa chain and b chain or TcR5 chain and g chain, each vector<br>
in the library will constitute a pair of these variable region encoding sequences. The generation<br>
of libraries of pairs of variable region encoding sequences is well known in the art.<br>
Libraries comprising naturally occurring diversities are for example, combinatorial libraries<br>
(random pairing of the variable region encoding sequences) as well as cognate pair libraries<br>
(pairs of variable region encoding sequences derived from the same cell). Further libraries<br>
generated from isolated CDR gene fragments, which are incorporated into an appropriate<br>
framework (e.g. Soderlind, E. et al., 2000. Nat. Biotechnol. 18, 852-856), such as an antibody<br>
or TcR variable region are applicable with the present invention. The libraries are preferably<br>
screened to obtain sub-libraries (libraries of interest) with a desired specificity.<br>
Diversities of proteins can also be made in an artificial way, for example synthetic or by mutation.<br>
Mutations can either be random or point mutations of a nucleic acid sequence encoding<br>
a single protein, thereby generating a polyclonal population of the single protein. An-<br>
other example of generating artificial antibody libraries are described in EP 0 859 841, a<br>
method which is based on generating a library of variable region frameworks which can be<br>
combined with another library of CDRs.<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant polyclonal protein is a recombl-<br>
nant polyclonal antibody or antibody fragment.<br>
in another preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant polyclonal protein is a<br>
recombinant polyclonal TcR or TcR fragment.<br>
in addition to the diversity achieved by the genetic and somatic recombination in the so-<br>
called variable regions, there are different isotypes of the immunoglobulins, which are defined<br>
by the heavy chain. The main Isotypes are IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE.<br>
A recombinant polyclonal protein of the present invention can therefore also be constituted of<br>
the different Isotypes or more preferred of different subclasses. polyclonality of the immunoglobulins<br>
can occur in the constant part or in the variable domain of the immunoglobulin<br>
molecule or in both the constant part and the variable domain.<br>
polyclonality in the so-called constant region, particularly the heavy chain of the antibodies,<br>
is of interest with regard to therapeutic application of antibodies. The various immunoglobulin<br>
Isotypes have different biological functions (summarized in Table 1), which might be desirable<br>
to combine when utilizing antibodies for treatment because different Isotypes of Immunoglobulin<br>
may be implicated in different aspects of natural Immune responses (Canfield and<br>
Morrison 1991. 3.Exp.Med. 173,1483-91; Kumpel etal. 2002. Transfus.Clin.Blol. 9, 45.-53;<br>
Stirnadel et al. 2000. Epidemiol. infect. 124, 153-162).<br>
Table 1: Biological functions of the human immunoglobulin isotypes<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell<br>
line, comprising a collection of cells transfected with a library of variant nucleic acid se-<br>
quences, wherein each cell in the collection is transfected with and capable of expressing one<br>
member of the library, which encodes a distinct member of a polyclonal protein that binds a<br>
particular antigen and which Is located at the same single site in the genome of individual<br>
cells in said collection, wherein said nucleic acid sequence Is not naturally associated with<br>
said cell in the collection.<br>
in an additional embodiment of the above embodiment the variant nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding the polyclonal protein (preferably from the Immunoglobulln superfamily) are all<br>
derived from naturally occurring sequences, for example isolated from a donor.<br>
Compositions of cells that contain variant nucleic acids located at a single specific site in the<br>
genome within each cell has been described in WO 02/44361. This document discloses the<br>
use of the cells to identify molecules having desirable properties, but the reference does not<br>
deal with the provision of a production system or with the provision of polyclonal protein<br>
characterized by a specific binding to an antigen<br>
C\ona\ Diversity<br>
One of the characteristics of a polyclonal protein is that it is constituted by a number of indi-<br>
vidual protein molecules where each protein molecule is homologous to the other molecules<br>
of the polyclonal protein but also has a variability that is characterized by differences in the<br>
amino acid sequence between the individual members of the polyclonal protein. Preferably,<br>
the differences are confined to distinct areas of the overall structure of the polyclonal protein.<br>
Such areas are for example the variable region of an antibody or TcR and possibly further<br>
confined to the CDR regions in these areas. This variability can also be described as a diver-<br>
; sity, which can be Identified both on the nucleic acid level as well as on the protein functional<br>
level, e.g., specificity and affinity differences towards a target.<br>
Clonal diversity of the cell line may be analyzed by RFLP (or sequencing of (RT)-PCR pro-<br>
ducts) on isolated clones from a pool of cells expressing a recombinant polyclonal protein.<br>
The diversity can also be analyzed by functional tests (e.g., EUSA) on the recomblnant poly-<br>
donal protein produced by the cell line.<br>
Clonal bias (i.e., a gradual change in the content of the individual antibodies constituting the<br>
polyclonal antibody), if it exists, can be estimated by comparing the clonal diversity of the<br>
initial library, used for transfectlon, with the diversity found in the pool of cells (cell line) ex-<br>
pressing the recombinant polyclonal protein.<br>
Clonal diversity of a polyclonal protein expressed from a cell line can be assessed as the tar-<br>
get coverage by the polyclonal protein. in this case sufficient diversity is considered to be<br>
acquired when approximately 25-100% of the desired target molecules are bound by the<br>
polyclonal protein. For example in the case of a polyclonal antibody, the binding of antibody<br>
to at least 25% of the non-identical epitopes on the surface of a target antigen provides a<br>
sufficient diversity in the composition. Preferably, clonal diversity by target coverage Is at<br>
least 50%, and even more preferable at least 75%. For antibodies such a target coverage<br>
could for example be assessed by epitope mapping.<br>
Alternatively clonal diversity can be assessed as the distribution of individual members of the<br>
polyclonal composition. This distribution can be assessed as the total number of different<br>
individual members in the final polyclonal protein composition compared to the number of<br>
different encoding sequences originally introduced into the cell line during transfection. in<br>
this case sufficient diversity is considered to be acquired when at least 50% of the encoding<br>
sequences originally used in the transfection can be identified as different individual members<br>
of the final polyclonal proteins and preferably at least 75%.<br>
The distribution of individual members of the polyclonal composition can also be assessed<br>
with respect to the mutual distribution among the individual members. in this case sufficient<br>
clonal diversity is considered to be acquired if no single member of the composition constitutes<br>
more than 75 % of the total number of individual members in the final polyclonal protein<br>
composition. Preferably, no individual member exceeds more that 50%, even more preferred<br>
25 % and most preferred 10% of the total number of individual members in the final<br>
polyclonal composition. The assessment of clonal diversity based on the distribution of the<br>
individual members in the polyclonal composition can be performed by RFLP analysis, se-<br>
quence analysis and protein analysis such as the approaches described later on for characterization<br>
of a poiyclonal composition.<br>
Clonal diversity may be reduced as a result of clonal bias which can arise a) during the cloning<br>
process, b) as a result of variations in cellular proliferation, or c) through scrambling of<br>
multiple integrants. If such biases arise, each of these sources of a loss of clonal diversity is<br>
easily remedied by minor modifications to the methods as described herein.<br>
in order to limit bias introduced by cloning of the variable domains into the appropriate vectors,<br>
the transfer of the genes of interest from one vector to another may be designed in<br>
such a way that cloning bias is limited. Mass transfer techniques and a careful selection of the<br>
E. coll strain used for amplification can reduce the cloning bias. Another possibility is to perform<br>
an individual transfer of each polynucleotide encoding an individual member of the poly-<br>
clonal protein, between vectors of the invention.<br>
It is possible that variations in cellular proliferation rates of the individual cells in the cell line<br>
could, over a prolonged period of time, introduce a bias into the recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
expression, increasing or reducing the presence of some members of the recombinant<br>
polyclonal protein expressed by the cell line. One reason for such variations in proliferation<br>
rates could be that the population of cells constituting the starting cell line used for the initial<br>
transfection is heterogeneous. It is known that individual cells in a cell line develop differently<br>
over a prolonged period of time. To ensure a more homogeneous starting material, sub-<br>
cloning of the cell line prior to transfection with the library of interest may be performed u-<br>
sing a limiting dilution of the cell line down to the single cell level and growing each single<br>
cell to a new population of cells (so-called cellular sub-cloning by limiting dilution). One or<br>
more of these populations of cells are then selected as starting material based on their proliferation<br>
and expression properties.<br>
Further, the selection pressure used to ensure that only cells that have received site-specific<br>
integrants will survive, might affect proliferation rates of individual cells within a polyclonal<br>
cell line. This might be due to the favoring of cells that undergo certain genetic changes in<br>
order to adapt to the selection pressure. Thus, the choice of selection marker might also influence<br>
proliferation rate-induced bias. If this occurs, different selection markers should be<br>
tested. in cases where selection is based on a substance that is toxic to the cells, the optimal<br>
concentration should be tested carefully, as well as whether selection is needed throughout<br>
the entire production period or only in the initial phase.<br>
An additional approach to ensure a well defined cell population is to use fluorescence acti-<br>
vated cell sorting (FACS) after the transfection and selection procedures. Fluorescence labeled<br>
antibodies can be used to enrich for highly productive cells derived from a pool of cells<br>
transfected with IgG constructs (Brezinsky et al. J. 2003. Immunol Methods 277, 141-155).<br>
This method can also be used to sort cells expressing similar levels of immunoglobulin,<br>
thereby creating a homogenous cell population with respect to productivity. Likewise, by u-<br>
sing labeling with the fluorescent dye 5,6-carboxylfluorescein dlacetate succinlmldyl ester<br>
(CFSE) cells showing similar proliferation rates can be selected by FACS methods.<br>
Even if a proliferation rate-induced bias does develop, the loss or over-representation of individual<br>
members might not necessarily be critical, depending on the diversity requirements of<br>
the final recomblnant polyclonal protein product and the stability of the diversity over time.<br>
in site-specific single integrants, the cells will only differ in the sequence of the variable regions<br>
of the antibodies to be expressed. Therefore, the different cellular effects imposed by<br>
variation in integration site and gene regulatory elements are eliminated and have minimal<br>
effects on the cellular proliferation rate. Neither scrambling nor multiple integrations is likely<br>
to cause problems in the proliferation rate of the manufacturing cell line, since these are rare<br>
events. Random integrations generally occur with an efficiency of approximately 10-5,<br>
whereas site-specific integration occurs with an efficiency of approximately 10"3. If multiple<br>
integrations should unexpectedly pose a problem, an alternative is to repeat the transfection<br>
with the library of vectors of interest, because the likelihood that the event will reoccur is<br>
very small, as described above. Additional alternatives are described in Example 3 below.<br>
Another method of controlling unwanted clonal bias is to perform the transfection with the<br>
entire library of vectors of interest in several sub-pools or to split the cell pool at an early<br>
time point after transfection into sub-pools. At this point, the bias should not have become<br>
significant and it should be statistically possible to acquire sub-pools that lack clones with an<br>
unwanted proliferation advantage. The resulting exclusion of unwanted clones has to be in<br>
agreement with the requirements of diversity in the final recombinant poiyclonal protein<br>
product. Considering statistics, bulk transfection of a large number of cells also constitutes a<br>
way to circumvent an undesired clonal bias. in this approach, a host cell line is transfected in<br>
bulk with the library of variant nucleic acid sequences. Such a library constitutes many copies<br>
of each distinct member of the library. These copies should preferably be integrated into a<br>
large number of host cells. Preferably at least 100, 1000, 10000 or 100000 individual cells<br>
are transfected with copies of distinct members of the library of variant nucleic acid sequen-<br>
ces. Thus, if a library of distinct variant nucleic acid sequences is composed of 1000 distinct<br>
members which are each integrated into 1000 individual cells, 106 clones containing a site-<br>
specifically integrated GOI should arise from the transfection. in this manner the gausian<br>
curve of individual cell doubling rates should influence the general population only in very<br>
small degrees. This will increase the probability of keeping the clonal composition constant<br>
over time even if a low percentage of the manufacturing cells should exhibit aberrant growth<br>
and/or expression properties.<br>
Alternatively, the library of vectors of interest can be split into fractions containing approximately<br>
5 to 50 individual vectors of the library. Preferably, a fraction of the library constitutes<br>
10 to 15 individual vectors. Each fraction is then transfected into an aliquot of cells. The individual<br>
aliquots of cells can then be followed for a period of time to see if clonal bias develops<br>
in any of them. If this happens such aliquots of cells can be omitted before the collection of<br>
cells is reconstituted by pooling the remaining aliquots of cells. Optionally, the aliquots of<br>
cells are kept separate throughout production, and the polyclonal antibody composition is<br>
assembled by combining the products of each aliquot rather than the aliquots of cells before<br>
production. The number of pools that can be handled are expected to be between five to ten<br>
(see the previous description of monoclonal antibodies).<br>
Alternatively, a high throughput method may be implemented in which cells are transfected<br>
separately using vectors and cells based on single clones from the initial library of vectors of<br>
interest. This may eliminate any possible sequence bias during transfection and integration.<br>
Optionally, the single transfectants may be genotyped and a fully diverse pool of cells as-<br>
sembled just prior to production or earlier if appropriate. Alternatively, the individual trans-<br>
fection of a large number of cells, generating many clones with the same distinct member of<br>
the library of variant nucleic add sequences may produce the same statistical advantages<br>
described for bulk transfection, when the individually transfected cells are pooled prior to the<br>
manufacture of the polyclonal protein.<br>
The host cell<br>
A suitable host cell comprises, in a region of its genome, one or more suitable recombination<br>
sites, i.e., nucleic acid sequences recognizable by one or more recombinase enzymes. To be<br>
able to select for integrants, (i.e., cells having an integrated copy of the nucleic add sequence<br>
of interest in an integration site) the recombination site is operably linked to a first selection<br>
gene (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene) situated 3' to the recombination site. Furthermore,<br>
a weak promoter (e.g., a truncated SV40 early promoter) and a transcription start<br>
codon may be situated 5' to the recombination site that constitutes an integral part of the<br>
resistance marker-coding region. Thus, the transcription start codon initiates the start of<br>
transcription of the selection gene in the host cell before transfection with the library of ex-<br>
pression vectors encoding the polyclonal protein.<br>
Host cells for site-specific integration as described above can be generated from any cell<br>
which can integrate DNA into their chromosomes or retain extra-chromosomal elements such<br>
as mini-chromosomes, YACs (Yeast artificial chromosomes), MACs (Mouse artificial chromosomes),<br>
or HACs (Human artificial chromosomes). MACs and HACs are described in detail in<br>
WO 97/40183, hereby incorporated by reference. Preferably mammalian cells such as CHO<br>
cells, COS cells, BHK cells, myeloma cells (e.g., Sp2/0 or NSO cells), fibroblasts such as NIH<br>
3T3, and Immortalized human cells, such as HeLa cells, HEK 293 cells, or PER.C6, are used.<br>
However, non-mammalian eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, such as plant cells, insect cells,<br>
yeast cells, fungi, E. coli etc., can also be employed.<br>
in one embodiment of the present invention, the cell line which Is to be used as starting material<br>
is sub-cloned by performing a so-called limiting dilution of the cell line down to a single<br>
cell level, followed by growing each single cell to a new population of cells prior to transfec-<br>
tion with the library of vectors of interest. Such sub-cloning can also be performed later in<br>
the process of selecting the right cell line, If desired.<br>
The host cells for site-specific integration may be obtained by transfection with a randomly<br>
integrating plasmid comprising a weak promoter (e.g., a truncated SV40 early promoter), a<br>
transcription start codon, a recombination site situated 3' to the start codon. Preferably, the<br>
integrating plasmid also comprises a marker gene coupled to a first selection gene. One example<br>
of such an integrating plasmid is the pFRT/LacZeo2 from invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).<br>
The marker gene can be used to evaluate the relative strength of expression at the genomic<br>
location used for inserting a nucleic acid sequence of interest. A marker gene, (e.g., beta-<br>
galactosidase (LacZ), green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a cell surface marker) can be linked<br>
to the first selection gene in a gene fusion or transcriptionally linked by an IRES (internal<br>
ribosomal entry site) such that co-expression of the first selection gene and marker gene<br>
occurs. The use of a selection gene that establishes a survival pressure on the cells (e.g. drug<br>
resistance or nutritional depletion) combined with a marker allowing for evaluation of the<br>
relative expression levels from cell line to cell line is an efficient method to ensure high producing<br>
cells which maintain the integrated plasmid within the genome. Cells with the recombination<br>
sequence inserted at a spot with particularly active transcription will lead to high<br>
expression of the marker gene e.g. GFP or LacZ. High expressers can be selected by fluorescence<br>
activated cell sorting (FACS) and cloned. At this point it should also be analyzed<br>
whether the integrant is a single integrant. This can be performed by real-time PCR and<br>
Southern blotting.<br>
Another method for evaluating relative expression levels from cells transfected with an integrating<br>
plasmid is to perform an additional integration-excision step on the cells generated as<br>
described above. This pool of selected cells are transfected again, with a plasmid encoding a<br>
recombinase corresponding to the recombination site of the integrating plasmid and a second<br>
plasmid containing a second selection marker without a start codon, the coding region of<br>
which is preceded by a recombination sequence likewise corresponding to the first integrating<br>
plasmid. This second plasmid also contains the coding sequence for a fluorescent marker<br>
protein (e.g., GFP (or equivalent fluorescent proteins) driven by a mammalian promoter. The<br>
recombinase mediates integration of this plasmid into the host cell genome where a similar<br>
recombination sequence previously has been inserted by the integrating plasmid. Cells with<br>
the recombination sequence insetted at a spot with particularly active transcription will lead<br>
to high expression of the fluorescent protein. High expressers are selected by fluorescence<br>
activated cell sorting (FACS) and cloned. Clones with consistently high expression and containing<br>
one copy of the inserted plasmid are transfected with the recombinase and selected<br>
by the first selection marker, identifying cells where the second plasmid sequence has been<br>
removed by the recombinase, making the first selection marker work again. These cells still<br>
contain the first recombination sequence inserted at a transcriptional hot-spot and can now<br>
be used for the expression of genes of interest.<br>
Cell lines, which achieve high expression of the marker gene upon integration of a single copy<br>
of the plasmid, are used for transfection with the gene of interest. The recombination site in<br>
the host cell Is preferably located in a gene or region of particularly active expression, I.e., in<br>
a so-called hot spot.<br>
The vector for site-specific integration<br>
A suitable vector comprises a suitable recombination site linked to a suitable selection gene<br>
different from the selection gene used for construction of the host cell. Suitable selection<br>
genes for use in mammalian cell expression include, but are not limited to, genes enabling<br>
for nutritional selection, such as the thymidine kinase gene (TK), glutamine synthetase gene<br>
(GS), tryptophan synthase gene (trpB) or histidinol dehydrogenese gene (hisD). Further,<br>
selection markers are antimetabolite resistance genes conferring drug resistance, such as the<br>
dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) which can be selected for with hypoxanthine and<br>
thymidine deficient medium and further selected for with methotrexate, the xanthine-guanine<br>
phosphoribosyltransferase gene(gpt), which can be selected for with mycophenolic acid, the<br>
neomycln phosphotransferase gene (neo) which can be selected for with G418 in eukaryotic<br>
cell and neomycin or kanamycln in prokaryotic celts, the hygromydn B phosphotransferase<br>
(hyg, hph, hpt) gene which can be selected for with hygromycin, the puromycin N-acetyl-<br>
transferase gene (pac) which can be selected with puromycin or the Blasticidin S deaminase<br>
gene(Bsd) which can be selected with blasticidin. Finally, genes encoding proteins that enables<br>
sorting e.g. by flow cytometry can also be used as selection markers, such as green<br>
fluorescent protein (GFP), the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) or other membrane proteins,<br>
or beta-galactosidase (LacZ).<br>
in one aspect of the present invention, the selectable gene Is neither preceded by a promoter<br>
nor equipped with a translation initiating codon. The promoter and ATG codon is provided at<br>
the selected site-specific recombination site. If this vector is integrated at a location other<br>
than the selected recombination site in the genome of the host cell, no expression of this<br>
second selection gene can occur due to lack of promoter and initiation codon. If integration<br>
occurs at the selected recombination site in the genome of the host cell, the second selection<br>
gene is expressed and expression of the first selection gene is lost.<br>
integration may e.g., be carried out using a so-called FRT site<br>
(5'-gaagttcctattccgaagttcctattctctagaaagtataggaacttc-3' (SEQ ID NO 1) and variants<br>
thereof) in the genome and on the vector for site-specific integration together with the Flp<br>
recomblnase or mutants thereof from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, other recomblna-<br>
se systems may equally well be used, including those of Cre recombinase and a variety of lox<br>
sites such as loxP from bacterlophage PI or variants or mutants thereof, e.g., Iox66, Iox71,<br>
10x76, Iox75, Iox43, Iox44 and Iox511 (C. Gorman and C. Bullock, Curr. Opinion in Biotechnology<br>
2000,11: 455-460) or by using phage integrase <dc31 or lambda integrase which></dc31>
carries out recombination between the attP site and the attB site (A.C. Groth et al. PNAS<br>
2000, 97: 5995-6000). Further recombinase systems that could be utilized in the present<br>
invention are, but are not limited to, the p-recombinase-slx system from bacterial plasmid<br>
pSM 19035, the Gln-gix system from bacteriophage Mu or the R-RS system from Zygosac-<br>
charomyces rouxii.<br>
A further variant to the site-specific recombination system is to use non-homologous recombination<br>
sites. in such a system, two non-identical recombination sites are introduced into<br>
the host genome for the generation of specific target sites. Recombination sites corresponding<br>
to those flanking the target site also flank the construct containing the gene of interest.<br>
Such a system has been described in WO 99/25854, which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety. The use of non-homologous recombination sites was shown to suppress<br>
excision of the GOI from the chromosome. The non-identical recombination sites can be<br>
composed of any of the recombination sites described above as long as the corresponding<br>
recombinases are provided. For example, non-identical recombination sites could consist of a<br>
FRT site and a mutant FRT site utilizing a Flp recombinase for integration or a FRT site and a<br>
loxP site utilizing Flp and Cre recombinases for the integration.<br>
Further, a system using two different FRT sites has been described in Verhoeyen et al., Hum.<br>
Gene Ther. 2001 12, 933-44. in this approach the integrating plasmid is transferred to the<br>
host cells by retro viral infection. The plasmid consists of a combination of a reporter gene<br>
and a first selection marker gene as well as the retroviral elements required for infection. The<br>
retrovlral 3'LTR contains two different FRT sites. A non functional second selection marker<br>
gene, which lacks a promoter and the translation initiating codon is located 3' to theses sites.<br>
During the process of retroviral infection the 3'LTR sequence is copied to the 5'LTR. This results<br>
in the flanking of the reporter gene and the first selection marker gene by two different<br>
FRT sites on each side. The sequence between the outer FRT sites can be exchanged against<br>
a GOI under the control of a strong promoter. The cassette containing the GOI Is flanked by<br>
the same set of FRT sites. The reaction is catalyzed by the Flp recombinase. in the transfected<br>
exchange plasmid an IRES element and a translation initiating codon are located further<br>
downstream of the GOI. After replacement of the integrated cassette the non functional<br>
selection marker gene located in the 3' LTR sequence outside the FRT sites is activated by the<br>
translation initiating codon provided by the GOI constituting cassette. The exchange status<br>
can further be enriched if a negative selection marker (e.g. thymidine kinase) Is present in<br>
the integrating vector.<br>
The integrating vector can also be transferred to the host cells by standard transfection. in<br>
this case the integrating cassette is flanked by an FRT at the 5' end and a different FRT'site at<br>
the 3' end. The ATG-deficient second resistance marker gene is positioned further downstream<br>
of the 3' FRT' site. The exchange for a GOI proceeds as described for the retroviral<br>
system.<br>
Another system that prevents excision of the GOI after its site-specific integration into the<br>
chromosome is the FC31 integrase, also mentioned above. This system has been described<br>
thoroughly in patent applications WO 01/07572 and WO 02/08409, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
in a further aspect of the invention, the vector for site-specific integration of the gene of in-<br>
terest further comprises DNA encoding one member of the recomblnant polyclonal protein of<br>
interest, optionally preceded by its own mammalian promoter directing expression of the<br>
protein. If a member of the recombinant polyclonal protein of interest comprises more than<br>
one protein chain, e.g., if the member is an antibody or T cell receptor, the DNA encoding the<br>
chains of the protein can be preceded by their own mammalian promoter directing high levels<br>
5 of expression (bi-directional or uni-directional, see figure 1 and 2, respectively) of each of the<br>
chains. in a bi-directional expression a head-to-head promoter configuration in the expression<br>
vector can be used and for a uni-directional expression two promoters or one promoter<br>
combined with e.g., an IRES sequence can be used for expression. Suitable head-to-head<br>
promoter configurations are for example, but not limited to, the AdMLP promoter together<br>
with the mouse metailothionein-1 promoter in both orientations, the AdMLP promoter together<br>
with the elongation factor-1 promoter in both orientations or the CMV promoter together<br>
with the MPSV promoter in both orientations.<br>
A nucleic acid sequence encoding a functional leader sequence can be included in the expression<br>
vector to direct the gene product to the endoplasmic reticulum or a specific location<br>
within the cell such as an organelle. A strong polyadenylation signal can be situated 3' of the<br>
protein-encoding DNA sequence. The polyadenylation signal ensures termination and<br>
polyadenylatlon of the nascent RNA transcript and is correlated with message stability. The<br>
DNA encoding a member of the recomblnant polyclonal protein of interest can, for example,<br>
encode both the heavy and light chains of an antibody or antibody fragments, each gene sequence<br>
optionally being preceded by their own mammalian promoter elements and/or followed<br>
by strong poly A signals directing high level expression of each of the two chains.<br>
The expression vector for site-specific integration can carry additional transcriptional regulatory<br>
elements, such as enhancers or UCOE (ubiquitous chromatln opening elements) for increased<br>
expression at the site of integration. Enhancers are nucleic acid sequences that interact<br>
specifically with cellular proteins involved in transcription. The UCOE opens chromatin<br>
or maintains chromatin in an open state and facilitates reproducible expression of an operably-linked<br>
gene (described in more detail in WO 00/05393, hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety). When one or more of the regulatory elements described in the above are integrated<br>
into the chromosome of a host cell they are termed heterologous regulatory elements.<br>
Establishing an expression system for high-level expression of proteins<br>
Methods for introducing a nucleic acid sequence into a cell are known in the art. These methods<br>
typically include the use of a DNA vector to introduce the sequence of interest into the<br>
cell, the genome or an extra-chromosomal element. Transfection of cells may be accomplished<br>
by a number of methods known to those skilled in the art, including calcium phosphate<br>
precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, liposome fusion, RBC ghost fusion, protoplast<br>
fusion, and the like.<br>
For the transfection of a host cell line, a library of vectors of interest, wherein each vector<br>
comprises only one copy of a nucleic acid sequence encoding one member of a recombinant<br>
polyclonal protein of interest, is used. This library of expression vectors of interest collectively<br>
encodes the. recombinant polyclonal protein of interest. Suitable vectors for site-specific integration<br>
was described in the previous section. The individual vectors constituting the library<br>
of variant nucleic acid sequences of interest can either be mixed together into a single composition,<br>
or the individual vectors encoding each library member can be kept in separate<br>
compositions or in mixtures of approximately 5 to 50 individual vectors of the library in a<br>
composition.<br>
The generation of a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line and the production of a<br>
recombinant polyclonal protein from such a cell line can be obtained by several different<br>
transfection and manufacturing strategies. These strategies are outlined in figure 3.<br>
One way, is to use a library of vectors mixed together into a single composition for the<br>
transfectlon of a host cell line. This method is termed bulk transfectlon or transfection in<br>
bulk. Generally the vector and host cell design previously described will ensure that a poly-<br>
clonal cell line will be obtained upon appropriate selection. in such a cell line a majority of the<br>
individual cells have integrated one copy of a nucleic acid molecule, encoding a distinct<br>
member of a recombinant polyclonal protein, from a library of nucleic acid sequences of interest<br>
into the genome. The single copy of the nucleic add sequence is integrated into a single<br>
specific site of the genome of each cell in the collection of cells, thereby generating a<br>
polycional cell line comprised of individual cells expressing individual members of the polyclonal<br>
protein of interest. A frozen stock of the polyclonal cell line will be generated before<br>
initiation of the recombinant polyclonal protein manufacturing.<br>
Another way is to use a library of vectors split into fractions, containing approximately 5 to<br>
50 individual vectors of the library in a composition, for transfectlon. Preferably, a fraction of<br>
the library constitutes 10 to 20 individual vectors. Each composition is then transfected into<br>
an aliquot of host cells. This method is termed semi-bulk transfection. The number of aliquots<br>
transfected will depend on the size of the library and the number of individual vectors in each<br>
fraction. If the library for example constitutes 100 distinct variant members, which are split<br>
into fractions containing 20 distinct variant members in a composition, 5 aliquots of host cells<br>
would need to be transfected with a library composition constituting a distict fraction of the<br>
original library. The aliquots of host cells are selected for site-specific: integration. Preferably,<br>
the distinct aliquots are selected separately. However, they can also be pooled before selection.<br>
The aliquots can be analyzed for their clonal diversity and only those with sufficient diversity<br>
will be used to generate a polyclonal GOI library stock. To obtain the desired polyclonal<br>
cell line for manufacturing, the aliquots can be mixed before generating the freezing<br>
stock, immediately after they have been retrieved from the stock or after a short proliferation<br>
and adaptation time. Optionally, the aliquots of cells are kept separate throughout production,<br>
and the polyclonal protein composition is assembled by combining the products of each<br>
aliquot rather than the aliquots of cells before production.<br>
A third way, is a high throughput method in which host cells are transfected separately using<br>
the individual vectors constituting the library of interest. This method is termed individual<br>
transfection. The individually transfected host cells are preferably selected for site-specific<br>
integration separately. However, they can also be pooled before selection. The individual cell<br>
clones generated upon selection may be analyzed with respect to proliferation time and integration<br>
pattern and preferably, those with similar growth rates and a single site-specific inte-<br>
gration are used to generate a polyclonal GOI library stock. The individual cell clones can be<br>
mixed to obtain the desired polyclonal cell line before generating the stock, immediately after<br>
they have been retrieved from the stock, or after a short proliferation and adaptation time.<br>
This approach may eliminate any possible residual sequence bias during transfection, integration<br>
and selection. Alternatively the individually transfected host cells are mixed before<br>
selection is performed, this will enable control of sequence bias due to transfection.<br>
A shared feature in the manufacturing strategies outlined in the above is that all the individual<br>
members constituting the recomblnant polyclonal protein can be produced in one, or a<br>
limited number of bioreactors, with approximately 10 as the maximum. The only difference Is<br>
the stage at which one chooses to generate the collection of cells that constitutes the recomblnant<br>
polyclonal manufacturing cell line.<br>
The host cell line to be used for expression and production of a recomblnant polyclonal protein<br>
of interest has one or more nucleic acid molecule(s) recognizable by a recombinase en-<br>
zyme(s) (e.g., cells prepared beforehand having an FRT site at a pre-determined location in<br>
the genome as described in e.g., US 5,677,177).<br>
The vector for site-specific integration is preferably integrated in a predefined genomic locus<br>
that mediates high-level expression, a so-called hot spot.<br>
If expression levels need to be increased, gene amplification can be performed using selection<br>
for a DHFR gene or a glutamine synthetase (GS) gene. This requires the use of vectors<br>
comprising such a selection marker.<br>
For the manufacturing of a polyclonal protein, where each protein member is comprised of<br>
more than two polypeptide chains, the combination of the chains might be of importance for<br>
the affinity, specificity and activity of the protein they form. This is for example seen for antibodies<br>
and TcRs. For example, is the combination of antibody variable heavy chain and variable<br>
light chain known to affect affinity and specificity of an antibody formed from the chains.<br>
Thus, when a library of antibody encoding sequences has been selected for their ability to<br>
produce antibodies with affinity to a certain target it is desirable to ensure that the combination<br>
of the variable heavy chain and variable light chain in the final product correspond to<br>
this. For this reason the polypeptide chains constituting an individual member of the polyclonal<br>
protein are placed in the same vector used for integration, thereby ensuring that they<br>
will be kept together throughout the process.<br>
The following description is one example of how to obtain a recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
expressing cell line, where scrambling of the chains is minimal if existing at all.<br>
A universal promoter cassette for constitutive expression having two promoters placed in<br>
opposite transcriptional direction, such as a head-to-head construction surrounded by the<br>
variable heavy chain and the whole of the kappa light chain was constructed, allowing transfer<br>
of the whole construct into a vector for site-specific integration said vector comprising a<br>
FRTsite and a hygromydn resistance gene and the heavy chain consta.it region. It is contemplated<br>
that a promoter cassette for indudble expression can also be used. Furthermore,<br>
the promoters can be placed tail-to-tail which will result in transcription in opposite direction<br>
or tall-to-head for unidirectional transcription. CHO-Flp-in cells (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)<br>
which stably express the lacZ-Zeocin fusion gene, were used for the experiment, rendering<br>
the cells resistant to the antibiotic Zeocin. The cells were maintained in a medium containing<br>
Zeocln. The cells were transfected in bulk with the library of vectors for site-specific integration<br>
encoding the polyclonal antibody and a different selection marker (hygromydn phospho-<br>
transferase) together with a plasmld expressing the Flp recomblnase. An indudble promoter<br>
can also be used for control of the expression. After transfectlon, the cells were cultivated in<br>
the presence of hygromycin. Cells that were resistant to hygromydn were subsequently<br>
grown in different culture systems, such as conventional small culture flasks, Nunc multilayer<br>
cell factories, small high yield bloreactors (MlniPerm, INTEGRA-CELLine) and spinner flasks to<br>
hollow fiber-and bloreactors. The cells were tested for antibody production using ELJSA. Polyclonal<br>
cell lines were selected for viability in suspension growth in serum free medium with-<br>
out selection pressure for extended periods. Stocks of cell lines were grown in the presence<br>
of hygromycin.<br>
Evaluation of the preservation of polyclonalfty in the expression system<br>
According to the present invention, it is often important to ensure that the polyclonality in the<br>
expression system Is not seriously altered during production so that it is possible to stop the<br>
production when polyclonality is indeed altered. This is according to the invention done by<br>
monitoring the relative expression levels of the variant nucleic acid sequences. The expression<br>
levels can for example be monitored at mRNA level using for example RFLP analysis,<br>
arrays or real-time PCR, or at the protein level using for example two-dimensional polyacryl-<br>
amide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry or various chromatographlc techniques. With<br>
these techniques it will be possible to establish a baseline value for a number of all of the<br>
individual expression levels and then take out samples from the culture during production in<br>
order to gauge whether expression levels have changed (both in total and relatively). in<br>
normal practice of the invention, a range of values surrounding the baseline values can be<br>
established, and if the relative expression levels are found to be outside the ranges, then<br>
production is terminated.<br>
To be able to evaluate the stability and reprodudbllity of the expression system, vectors encoding<br>
six distinct Fab fragments (the mini six library) with reactivity against chicken oval-<br>
bumin (OVA), bovine alkaline phosphatase (AP), human b2-microglobulln ((b2m), human hap-<br>
toglobln (HAP), human Factor VIII (FVIII) and hen egg white lysozyme (LYS) were prepared.<br>
The different Fab fragment encoding sequences are not identical and therefore exhibit different<br>
RFLP patterns, whereby RFLP can be used for analyzing the genotype composition.<br>
The mini six library was introduced into CHO-Flp-in cells by transfectlon using an expression<br>
vector with a head-to-head promoter cassette. The CHO-Flp-in cells were either transfected<br>
in bulk with a mixture of expression vectors of interest encoding the six distinct antibodies<br>
resulting in a polyclonal cell line expressing the six antibodies in known combination or the<br>
cells were transfected individually with one member of the expression library of interest followed<br>
by mixing of the transfected cells, generating a recombinant polyclonal antibody expressing<br>
cell line expressing the six antibodies in known combination. in this manner, it was<br>
possible to test whether the transfectlon of the mammalian cells occurs without generating a<br>
bias to one or several individual clones of the recombinant polyclonal antibody expressing cell<br>
line. Furthermore, It was possible to check for proliferation bias and bias caused by the purification<br>
of the polyclonal composition of antibodies.<br>
Establishment of an anti-ovalbumin recombinant polyclonal antibody manufacturing cell line<br>
Ovalbumin-binding phage clones were selected using phage display and ELISA to identify the<br>
relevant clones. Two setups were used for identifying antibodies from the ovalbumin-binding<br>
clones, i.e., ELISA plates coated with ovalbumin or a high density screening method (HDS),<br>
based on immobilization of ovalbumin on PVDF membranes. in this manner a panel of antibodies<br>
were obtained, of which some recognize ovalbumin immobilized on the ELISA plate<br>
and others recognize ovalbumin immobilized on the PVDF membrane.<br>
The selected ovalbumin-binding phage clones may have their variable heavy and kappa chain<br>
DNA sequences linked to mammalian promoters and transferred into a vector of the<br>
pSymvc20 type (figure 4D) for antibody expression generating a collection of clones of the<br>
pSymvc21 type (figure 4E). The CHO-Flp-in cells are either transfected in bulk with a mixture<br>
of the pSymvc21 clones or the cells are transfected individually with one pSymvc21 antibody<br>
expressing plasmid followed by mixing of the transfected cells expressing the other ovalbumin<br>
binding antibodies. The procedure of creating an anti-ovalbumin polyclonal antibody producing<br>
cell line can be monitored by DNA sequencing, TaqMan PCR and RFLP analysis of indi-<br>
vidual antibody expressing cells, as well as ELISA, 2-dlmensional (2D) liquid chromatography<br>
(LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) of the produced antibody mixture.<br>
Cultivation of cells and production of a recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
The polyclonal cell line produced as described above is grown in suitable media under suitable<br>
conditions for expressing the polyclonal protein of interest encoded by the variant nucleic<br>
acid.sequences inserted into the genome of the cells. The cell cultivation may be performed<br>
in several steps. A first step is where the polyclonal cell line is selected for site-specific inte-<br>
grants. When using mammalian cells, the selected cells are then preferably adapted to<br>
growth in suspension as well as serum free conditions. This can be performed in one or two<br>
steps and with or without selection pressure. When the polyclonal cell line Is adapted to the<br>
appropriate conditions scaling up can be initiated. At this point a working cell stock can be<br>
frozen down. Preferably bioreactors of between 30 and 100 liters are used, but smaller or<br>
larger bloreactors may be employed. The suitable production time and choice of bioreactor<br>
size are dependent on the desired yield of protein from the batch and expression levels from<br>
the cell line. Times might vary from a couple of days up to three month The expressed re-<br>
combinant polyclonal protein is isolated from the cells or the supernatant. The recombinant<br>
protein is purified and characterized according to procedures known by a person skilled in the<br>
art. Examples of purification and characterization procedures are listed below.<br>
Purification of a recombinant polyclonal protein from culture supernatant<br>
Isolation of specific proteins from culture supernatants is possible using various chroma-<br>
tographic techniques that utilize differences in the physico-chemical properties of proteins,<br>
e.g. differences in molecular weight, net charge, hydrophobiclty, or affinity towards a specific<br>
ligand or protein. Proteins may thus be separated according to molecular weight using gel<br>
filtration chromatography or according to net charge using ion-exchange (cation/anion)<br>
chromatography or alternatively using chromatofocusing, Similarly, proteins may be sepa-<br>
rated after hydrophobicity using hydrophobic interaction chromatography or affinity chroma-<br>
tography utilizing differences in affinity towards a specific immobilized ligand or protein.<br>
Separation of complex mixtures of proteins may thus be achieved by sequential combination<br>
of various chromatographic principles. A mixture of proteins may thus initially be separated<br>
according to e.g. net charge using ion-exchange chromatography and proteins of similar net<br>
charge may subsequently be separated according to molecular weight using gelfiltration<br>
chromatography or after hydrophobicity using hydrophobic interactions chromatography in<br>
the presence of a high concentration of a selected salt.<br>
Affinity chromatography combined with subsequent purification steps such as ion- exchange<br>
chromatography, hydrophobic interactions and gel filtration has frequently been used for the<br>
purification of IgG (polyclonal as well as monoclonal) and TcR from different sources e.g.,<br>
ascites fluid, cell culture supernatants and serum. Affinity purification, where the separation<br>
is based on a reversible interaction between the protein(s) and a specific ligand coupled to a<br>
chromatographic matrix, is an easy and rapid method, which offers high selectivity, usually<br>
high capacity and concentration into a smaller volume. Protein A and protein G, two bacterial<br>
cell surface proteins, have high affinity for the Fc region, and haye, in an Immobilized form,<br>
been used for many routine applications, including purification of. polyclonal IgG and its subclasses<br>
from various species and absorption and purification of immune complexes.<br>
Following affinity chromatography, downstream chromatography steps, e.g. ion-exchange<br>
and/or hydrophobic interaction chromatography, can be performed to remove host ceil proteins,<br>
leaked Protein A, and DNA.<br>
Gel filtration, as a final purification step, can be used to remove contaminant molecules such<br>
as dimers and other aggregates, and transfer the sample into storage buffer. Depending on<br>
the source and expression conditions it may be necessary to include an additional purification<br>
step to achieve the required level of antibody purity. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
or ion-exchange chromatography are thus frequently used, in combination with Protein A<br>
and gelfiltratlon chromatography, to purify antibodies for therapeutic use.<br>
in order to purify other classes of antibodies, alternative affinity chromatography media have<br>
to be used since proteins A and G do not bind IgA and IgM. An immunoaffinity purification<br>
can be used (anti-IgA or anti-IgM monoclonal antibodies coupled to solid phase) or, alternatively,<br>
multistep purification strategies including ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction<br>
can be employed.<br>
Structural Characterization<br>
Structural characterization of polyclonal proteins such as antibodies and TcRs requires high<br>
resolution due to the complexity of the mixture (clonal diversity and glycosylation). Traditional<br>
approaches such as gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography or electrophoresis may<br>
not have sufficient resolution to differentiate among the individual antibodies. Two-dimensional<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) has been used for profiling of complex<br>
protein mixtures followed by mass spectrometry (MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)-MS<br>
(e.g., proteomics). 2D-PAGE, which combines separation on the basis of a protein's charge<br>
and mass, has proven useful for differentiating among polyclonal, ollgoclonal and monoclonal<br>
immunoglobulin in serum samples. However, this method has some limitations. Chromatographic<br>
techniques, in particular capillary and LC coupled to electrospray ionizatlon MS are<br>
increasingly being applied for the analysis of complex peptide mixtures. LC-MS has been used<br>
for the characterization of monoclonal antibodies and recently also for profiling of polyclonal<br>
antibody light chains. The analysis of very complex samples requires more resolving power of<br>
the chromatographlc system, which can be obtained by separation in two dimensions (or<br>
more). Such an approach could be based on ion-exchange in the first dimension and rever-<br>
sed-phase chromatography (or hydrophoblc interaction) in the second dimension optionally<br>
coupled to MS.<br>
Functional Characterization<br>
A polyclonal protein can for example be characterized functionally through comparability<br>
studies with polyclonal proteins with specificity towards the same target or a similar activity.<br>
Such studies can be performed in vitro as well as in vivo.<br>
An in vitro functional characterization of a polyclonal antibody could for example be immuno-<br>
preclpltatlon which is a highly specific technique for the analytical separation of target antigens<br>
from crude cell lysates. By combining immunoprecipitation with other techniques, such<br>
as SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining (Coomassle Blue, silver staining or biotin labeling)<br>
and/or immunoblottlng, It is possible to detect and quantify antigens e.g., and thus evaluate<br>
some of the functional properties of the antibodies. Although this method does not give an<br>
estimate of the number of antibody molecules nor their binding affinities, it provides a visualization<br>
of the target proteins and thus the specificity. This method can likewise be used to<br>
monitor potential differences of the antibodies toward antigens (the integrity of the clonal<br>
diversity) during the expression process.<br>
An in vivo functional characterization of a polyclonal antibody could for example be infection<br>
studies. An experimental animal such as a mouse can for example be infected with a specific<br>
virus, towards which a polyclonal antibody has been developed. The degree to which the infection<br>
can be inhibited will indicate functionality of the polyclonal antibody.<br>
Therapeutic compositions<br>

diseases, autoimmune diseases, immunological malfunctions, cardiovascular diseases, diseases<br>
in the central nervous system, metabolic and endocrine diseases, transplantation re-<br>
jections and undesired pregnancy. The mammal is preferably a human, a domestic animal or<br>
a pet.<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises<br>
a recombinant polyclonal antibody or antibody fragment as the active ingredient and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable exciplent.<br>
in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprises a recombinant polyclonal T cell receptor or T cell receptor fragment as the active<br>
ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable exclpient.<br>
For the treatment or prevention of infections, the pharmaceutical composition according to<br>
the invention comprises a recombinant polyclonal protein of interest capable of reacting with<br>
or binding to an infectious microorganism such as a microorganism selected from bacteria,<br>
myoobacteria, virus, mycoplasma, rickettsia, spirochetes, protozoa, fungi, helminthes and<br>
ectoparasites.<br>
Recombinant human polyclonal proteins may be administered within a pharmaceutlcaliy-ac-<br>
ceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient, in unit dosage form. Conventional pharmaceutical<br>
practice may be employed to provide suitable formulations or compositions to administer the<br>
compounds to patients suffering from a disease, for example, caused by excessive cell proliferation.<br>
Administration may begin before the patient is symptomatic. Any appropriate route<br>
of administration may be employed, for example, administration may be parenteral, intravenous,<br>
intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intra-<br>
ventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intradsternal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, aerosol, suppository,<br>
or oral administration. For example, therapeutic formulations may be in the form of,<br>
liquid solutions or suspensions; for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of<br>
tablets or capsules chewing gum, pasta, compositions suitable for the application onto the<br>
skin may be in the form of creams, ointments, lotions, gels, pads or other, compositions suitable<br>
for application onto the vaginal or urogenital mucosa may be in the form of vagitories,<br>
gels or other and for intranasal formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared in a manner known<br>
perse, for example, by means of conventional dissolving, lyophilising, mixing, granulating or<br>
confectioning processes. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated according to<br>
conventional pharmaceutical practice (see for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice<br>
of Pharmacy (20th ed.), ed. A.R. Gennaro, 2000, Llppincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia,<br>
PA and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan,<br>
1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY).<br>
Solutions of the active ingredient, and also suspensions, and especially isotonic aqueous solutions<br>
or suspensions, are preferably used, it being possible, for example in the case of lyo-<br>
philized compositions that comprise the active ingredient alone or together with a carrier, for<br>
example mannitol, for such solutions or suspensions to be produced prior to use. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be sterilized and/or may comprise exclpients, for example preservatives,<br>
stabilisers, wetting and/or emulsifying agents, solubillsers, salts for regulating the<br>
osmotic pressure and/or buffers, and are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by<br>
means of conventional dissolving or lyophilising processes. The said solutions or suspensions<br>
may comprise viscosity-increasing substances, such as sodium carboxyrnethylcellulose, car-<br>
boxy methylcellulose, dextran, poly vlnylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
The injection compositions are prepared in customary manner under sterile conditions; the<br>
same applies also to introducing the compositions into ampoules or vials and sealing the<br>
containers.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active<br>
ingredient with solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the<br>
mixture, if desired or necessary, after the addition of appropriate exclpients, into tablets,<br>
drage cores or capsules. It is also possible for them to be incorporated into plastics carriers<br>
that allow the active ingredients to diffuse or be released in measured amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprise from approximately 1% to approximately 95%,<br>
preferably from approximately 20% to approximately 90%, active ingredient. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions according to the invention may be, for example, in unit dose form, such as in<br>
the form of ampoules, vials, suppositories, drages, tablets or capsules.<br>
The formulations can be administered to human patients in therapeutically effective amounts<br>
(e.g., amounts which prevent, eliminate, or reduce a pathological condition) to provide the-<br>
rapy for a disease or condition. The preferred dosage of therapeutic agent to be administered<br>
is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of the disorder, the overall health<br>
status of the particular patient, the formulation of the compound excipients, and its route of<br>
administration.<br>
If desired, treatment with recomblnant human polyclonal antibodies may be combined with<br>
more traditional therapies. For example in the treatment of cancer such combinatorial therapies<br>
could take the form of surgery or administration of chemotherapeutics or other anti-cancer<br>
agents.<br>
in another embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention comprises a recomblnant polyclonal protein of interest capable of reacting with or<br>
binding to an infectious microorganism such as a microorganism selected from bacteria, my-<br>
cobacteria, virus, mycoplasma, rlckettsia, splrochetes, protozoa, fungi, helmlnthes and ectoparasites.<br>
Therapeutic uses of the compositions according to the invention<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be used for the<br>
treatment, amelioration or prevention of a disease in a mammal. Diseases that can be<br>
treated with the present pharmaceutical compositions include cancer, infectious diseases,<br>
inflammatory diseases, allergy, asthma and other respiratory diseases, autoimmune diseases,<br>
cardiovascular diseases, diseases in the central nervous system, metabolic and endocrine<br>
diseases, transplantation rejections and undesired pregnancy.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is a method for disease treatment, amelioration or prophylaxis<br>
in an animal, wherein an effective amount of the recombinant polyclonal antibody or<br>
antibody fragment is administered. in further aspect an effective amount of the recombinant<br>
polyclonal T cell receptor or T cell receptor fragment is administered.<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention is the use of a recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
or recombinant polyclonal T cell receptor or fragments of antibodies or T cell receptors for the<br>
preparation of a composition for the treatment of diseases selected from a group consisting<br>
of a cancer, an infection, an inflammatory disease, an allergy, asthma or other respiratory<br>
disease, immunological malfunctions, an autoimmune disease, a cardiovascular disease, a<br>
disease in the central nervous system, a metabolic disease, an endocrine diseases, transplant<br>
rejection, and undesired pregnancy.<br>
Diagnostic use and environmental detection use<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is directed to diagnostic kits and kits for environmental<br>
detection use as well as methods for using these kits. Kits according to the present invention<br>
comprise a recombinant polyclonal protein prepared according to the invention which protein<br>
may be labeled with a detectable label or non-labeled for non-label detection. If labeled, the<br>
present recombinant polyclonal protein may be added to a sample suspected of containing<br>
the target molecule and the presence or absence of the label indicate the presence or absence<br>
of the target molecule. The sample to be tested may be a sample of bodily fluid such<br>
as blood, serum, plasma, spinal fluid, lymph or urine or a non-mammalian sample such as a<br>
sample from an environmental source suspected of harboring a contaminant. Non-mammal-<br>
ian samples may be water, air or contaminated earth. Non-label detection encompasses the<br>
measurement of refractive change in BlAcore upon binding, wherein the recomblnant poly-<br>
clonal protein is used to capture the target molecule.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples describe how recombinant polyclonal antibodies are expressed and<br>
produced in a high-producer cell line, where gene(s)/vector(s) of interest have been inserted<br>
by site-specific integration into a pre-characterized chromosomal "hot spot" site.<br>
in the examples, CHO cells were utilized as host cell. The advantages thereof include the<br>
availability of suitable growth medium, their ability to grow efficiently to a high density in<br>
culture, and their ability to express mammalian proteins such as antibodies in a biologically<br>
active form.<br>
in general, transformation of E. coll and transfection of mammalian cells according to the<br>
subject invention will be performed according to conventional methods. To improve the understanding<br>
of the invention, construction of exemplary vectors and their usage in producing<br>
a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line for recomblnant polyclonal protein expression<br>
are described in the examples below.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention, but should not be viewed as limiting the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Site-specific integration versus random integration<br>
For the following transfection experiment, the CHO Flp-in cells (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)<br>
were used. The efficiency of the system was tested using human secreted alkaline phos-<br>
phatase (SEAP) as a reporter gene. Two plasmid constructs were prepared:<br>
1. SEAP inserted into pcDNA3.1hygro+ (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (for random integration)<br>
2. SEAP inserted into pcDNA5/FRT (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (for site-specific integration)<br>
The two plasmid constructs were very similar with respect to regulatory elements, i.e. promoter,<br>
polyadenylation etc. which made It possible to use the plasmlds for comparing random<br>
integration with site-specific integration.<br>
CHO Flp-in cells were transfected with plasmid construct 1 alone or plasmid construct 2 together<br>
with the recomblnase-encodlng plasmid pOG44 according to the procedure described<br>
by invitrogen. Transfectants were selected using hygromycin and the production of 5EAP<br>
from pools of transfectants was measured.<br>
Cells transfected by site-specific integration produced approximately 6 times more SEAP than<br>
cells transfected by random integration proving the efficiency of the system and the cell line.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Design and preparation of an expression vector for site-specific integration in a host cell<br>
An expression vector suitable for site-specific integration into a hot spot chromosomal region<br>
of a host cell may be assembled comprising the following DNA elements:<br>
a) an FRT recombination site linked to the hygromycin resistance gene,<br>
b) a pUC origin of replication,<br>
c) an ampicillin resistance gene (bla),<br>
d) a bla-promoter allowing expression of the ampicillin (bla) resistance gene,<br>
e) gene(s), encoding a protein of interest (GOls),<br>
f) promoters) allowing expression of the GOI, and<br>
g) optionally, additional transcriptional or translational regulatory elements, such as enhancers<br>
or UCOE's, for increased expression at the site of integration or an IRES.<br>
To provide a better understanding of the construction of the expression vector, each of the<br>
elements are described in more details:<br>
a) An FRT recombination site linked to the hygromycin resistance gene for Flp recombinase-<br>
mediated integration and selection of a cell line with a majority of single integrants was used.<br>
The hygromycin gene was neither preceded by a promoter nor equipped with a transcription<br>
initiating codon, but a polyadenylation signal was added 3' of the gene. The FRT site used<br>
was 5'-gaagttcctattccgaagttcctattctctagaaagtataggaacttc-3' (SEQ ID NO 1).<br>
b) A pUC origin of replication was included to permit high copy number replication in an E.<br>
coll host cell.<br>
c) An Ampiclltin (bla) resistance gene (p-lactamase) allowing selection of E. coll transfor-<br>
mants was included.<br>
d) A bla-promoter allowed expression of the amplclllln (bla) resistance gene in E. coll.<br>
e) GOI encoding a protein of interest, e.g., a recomblnant polyclonal protein, antibody, the<br>
heavy and light chains of an antibody, as well as nucleotide sequences that encode all or a<br>
portion of either the constant region or variable region of an antibody molecule, and optionally<br>
all or a portion of a regulatory nucleotide sequence that controls expression of an antibody<br>
molecule were included.<br>
Immunoglobulln loci for heavy chains may include but is not limited to all or a portion of the<br>
V, D, J and switch region (including intervening sequences, also known as introns) and<br>
flanking sequences associated with or adjacent to the particular heavy chain constant region<br>
gene and it may include regions located within or downstream of the constant region (including<br>
introns).<br>
Immunoglobulin loci for the light chains may include but are not limited to the V and J regions,<br>
their upstream flanking sequences, and intervening sequences (introns) associated<br>
with or adjacent to the light chain constant region gene, and it may include regions located<br>
within or downstream of the constant region (including introns).<br>
For the modification of all or a portion of a constant region of an antibody, modifying sequences<br>
of the invention may include, but are not limited to an antibody constant region having a<br>
particular effector function, class and/or origin (e.g., igG, IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE constant regions<br>
of a human immunogiobulins or any other species) or a portion of a constant region<br>
which modifies the activity or properties of the constant region of the ;antibody; as well as<br>
genes which encode other molecules that confer some new function to a modified antibody<br>
molecule, e.g., an enzyme, toxin and the like.<br>
The gene(s) encoding a protein of interest may be operatively linked to nucleotide sequences<br>
encoding functional leader sequences directing the gene product to the secretory pathway.<br>
Further, 3' to the GOI encoding the protein of interest, e.g., such as a polyclonal antibody<br>
comprising heavy and light chains, there may be strong polyadenylation signals. The use of<br>
the mouse isotype IgGl in the following examples is for illustrative purposes and is not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
f) Promoters allowing expression of the GOI are provided. Therefore, a cassette comprising<br>
promoter and enhancer elements for expression is described. in the expression vector, each<br>
of the antibody genes may be preceded by their own mammalian promoter elements directing<br>
high level expression of each of the two chains, whether uni-dlrectlonally, bi-directionally<br>
or a tail-to-tail orientation of transcription cassettes is used.<br>
in a bl-dlrectlonal orientation of expression, a head-to-head promoter configuration can be<br>
used (construction of such a system is described in details in US Patent No. 5,789,208, which<br>
is incorporated by reference in its entirety). in a uni-directional expression system, two promoters<br>
or one promoter combined with e.g., an IRES sequence can also be used for expression.<br>
For construction of head-to-head promoters, a Pfu PCR amplification of the promoters is performed<br>
individually. The 5'-primer will initiate on the 5'-most base of the promoter, the 3'-<br>
end primer will include a unique restriction site, such as, a Xbal site. Following PCR amplification,<br>
the fragments may be separated on an agarose gel, and isolated from the gel using<br>
QiaQuick columns (Qiagen). This is followed by an Xbal restriction digestion, heat inactivation<br>
at 65°C for 20 minutes, and column purification of the fragments using QiaQuick. The fragments<br>
are then mixed and ligated together using E. colt ligase {New England Bioiabs (NEB)),<br>
an enzyme that preferentially llgates sticky ends. The ligation mix is PCR amplified with the<br>
5'-prlmers of each promoter to yield the complete head-to-head promoter (promoter A /<br>
promoter B) fragment. This fragment is kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (NEB),<br>
the enzyme is heat inactivated at 65°C for 20 minutes, and the fragment is ligated (blunt<br>
end) into the vector of interest (PCR amplified pSymvclO (see Figure 4) fragment, where the<br>
primers used for amplification anneal on each side of the promoter region amplifying everything<br>
except the promoter) using T4 ligase (NEB).<br>
Figs 1 and 2 show expression vectors comprising promoters for bi-directional and uni-dl-<br>
rectional, respectively. These promoters intend to illustrate, but not limit, the promoter<br>
choice in the invention.<br>
g) The expression vector can carry additional transcriptional and/or translational regulatory<br>
elements, such as enhancers and/or UCOE's, for increased expression at the site of integra-<br>
tion and/or IRES.<br>
Evaluation of polyclonallty preservation in the manufacturing system developed<br>
in order to be able to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of the manufacturing system,<br>
a ceil line expressing a polyclonal composition of distinct antibodies in known combination<br>
was prepared. The polyclonal antibody composition was termed the mini six composition. The<br>
library of nucleic acid sequences encoding the mini six composition was termed the mini six<br>
library.<br>
(a) Clone origin<br>
The following sequences encoding Fab fragments (the genes of interest) with reactivity<br>
against antigens 1-6 were used in this example:<br>
1. Ovalbumin (OVA). The Fab encoding fragments were selected from a murine anti-OVA<br>
phage display library.<br>
2. Alkaline phosphatase (AP). The Fab encoding fragments were selected from a murine anti-<br>
AP phage display library.<br>
3. p2-mlcroglobulin (pzm). The Fab encoding fragments were cloned from the hybridoma<br>
BBM.l (a gift from Dr. L. 0. Pedersen, Denmark), which was generated against p2m.<br>
4. Human haptoglobin (HAP). The Fab encoding fragments were selected from a murine anti-<br>
human haptoglobin phage display library.<br>
5. Factor VIII (FVIII). The parental monoclonal antibody of this Fab fragment was a FVIII F25<br>
monoclonal antibody (gift from Novo Nordisk, Denmark). The DNA encoding the VH and complete<br>
Kappa chains of this Fab fragment was sub-cloned into a phagemid, followed by insertion<br>
of the prokaryotic promoter cassette into the construct.<br>
6. Hen egg lysozyme (LYS). This construct was generated from the D1.3 scFv clone (Boulot,<br>
G. ef a/., J. Mol. Biol., 213(4) (1990) 617-619), by PCR amplification of VH and VK fragments<br>
and cloning into a phagemid.<br>
The phagemid clones exist either in transformed Escherlchla coll strain TGI glycerol stocks<br>
(kept at -80°C) or as phagemid DNA preparations.<br>
;b) RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing of the mini six library.<br>
The nucleotide sequences encoding the heavy chains of the Fab fragments were analyzed by<br>
HFLP as follows: The band patterns obtained after digest of the PCR generated fragments<br>
with the Nlalll and Hint I enzyme were examined. The different Fab fragment encoding sequences<br>
exhibited very different and easily distinguishable patterns. The nucleotide sequences<br>
encoding the VH and VL fragments were sequenced and sequences corresponding to<br>
the RFLP pattern were found. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences encoded open reading<br>
frames and translated into well-defined polypeptides.<br>
(c) ELISA analysis of the mini six composition<br>
The Fab fragments expressed from the clones were analyzed using ELISA, in which all Fab<br>
fragments were analyzed for reactivity with all antigens. Fab expression was monitored using<br>
an anti-kappa EUSA. All Fab fragments were tested in duplicate in ELISA. Ail clones expressed<br>
Fab fragments, and the Fab fragments reacted specifically with their relevant antigen.<br>
No background problems were found in the ELISA analyses.<br>
The six phagemid clones exist in individually transformed Escherichia coll strain TGI glycerol<br>
stocks, which were used in the model system for inoculation as described below.<br>
(d) Design of a polyclonal model system with six distinct antibodies in known combination.<br>
The six selected Fab-expressing clones (clones expressing Fab fragments of anti-OVA, antl-<br>
AP, anti-p2m, anti-HAP, antl-FVIII, and anti-LYS) were characterized by testing the reactivity<br>
of the expressed Fab fragments against the relevant antigens. These clones formed part of a<br>
polyclonal model system for testing the expression and production of six distinct antibodies in<br>
a known combination (the mini six composition). All Fab fragments encoding nucleotide sequences<br>
(the mini six library) were transferred into a phagemid vector (illustrated by<br>
pSymvclO, Figure 4A).<br>
(d.l) individual transfer of the GOI's from the phagemid vector into a vector for mammalian<br>
expression<br>
The transfer of the genes of interest (the mini six library) from a phagemid vector to a vector<br>
for mammalian expression was, in this example, performed by a two-step procedure. The<br>
first step was to replace the prokaryotic promoters with a mammalian promoter cassette in a<br>
head-to-head orientation. This step was followed by transferring the variable region of the<br>
GOI's, the promoter cassette and the constant kappa to the expression vector as described in<br>
detail below, and illustrated in figure 4.<br>
The head-to-head promoter cassette (promoter A / promoter B) was inserted into the<br>
phagemid vector for each clone by using a Sad/Xhol digestion followed by a ligatlon resulting<br>
in exchange of promoters from bacterial to mammalian. An EcoRI and Notl digest was<br>
then used to move the variable heavy chain, the head-to-head promoter cassette (promoter<br>
A / promoter B) and the complete kappa chain (fcoRI /Not I fragment) from the phagemid<br>
vector into the expression vector.<br>
An example of the individual transfer of each clone is given with the flow chart in figure 4.<br>
This figure shows plasmld pSymvclO where the heavy and kappa coding sequences of interest<br>
(e.g., gcO32 OVA) are present in the phagemid vector into which the head-to-head<br>
mammalian promoter cassette construct was ligated to replace the bacterial promoters using<br>
a SaclfXhol fragment transfer generating pSymvcl2.<br>
From this construct, the variable heavy chain-coding sequence including the promoter cassette<br>
and the whole of the kappa chain coding sequence was transferred into the mammalian<br>
isotype-encoding vector (pSymvc20) by a Nott/EcoKL transfer. The resulting vector<br>
(pSymvc2l) expressed the mouse antibody of interest (e.g., anti-OVA IgGl antibody).<br>
The variable heavy chain coding sequence, the mammalian promoter cassette and the entire<br>
kappa chain coding sequence from each of the six clones were transferred individually by a<br>
Notl/EcoRI transfer resulting in the mammalian expression vector pSymvc21, which expresses<br>
each of the GOI encoded antibody sequences as mouse IgGl antibodies.<br>
The six individual pSymvc21 clones containing the six GOIs were kept as TGI glycerol stocks.<br>
For transfectlori into CHO Flp-in cells, the TGI stocks were propagated individually, and after<br>
OD600 normalization for the number of E coli cells, the six cultures were mixed and used for<br>
plasmid preparation. This plasmid preparation comprising the six GOIs (the mini six library)<br>
was used for bulk transfection of mammalian cells for recombinant polyclonal protein expression.<br>
(d.2) Mass transfer of the GOI's from phagemid vectors into vectors for mammalian expression<br>
The GOIs (the mini six library)(here the EcoKl/Nott fragments), which were located in<br>
phagemid vectors and coding for six distinct Fab fragments (anti-OVA, anti-AP, anti-fom,<br>
antl-HAP, anti-FVTJI, and antl-LYS)r were transferred in-mass as a mixture of the six vector<br>
constructs into vectors for mammalian expression resulting in a mixture of six distinct expression<br>
vectors.<br>
The experimental procedure concerning the mass transfer follows the procedure described in<br>
(d.1) with the exception that it was performed in-mass, I.e. all six GOIs (encoding the variable<br>
heavy chains, including the head-to-head promoter cassette and complete kappa chains)<br>
were transferred simultaneously as a mixture of the six phagemid vectors.<br>
Plasmld preparations of the mini six library<br>
Plasmid Preparation 1 refers to a plasmid preparation of a mix of the six phagemid vectors<br>
(with the antibody coding sequences contained in the vector pSymvclQ).<br>
Plasmid Preparation 2 refers to a plasmid preparation of six phagemid vectors with the coding<br>
sequences contained in the vector pSymvcl2 after mass transfer step 1 (see figure 4C),<br>
which results in the exchange of the prokaryotic promoters with the mammalian promoter<br>
cassette constructs.<br>
Plasmid Preparation 3 refers to a plasmid preparation after mass transfer step 2 (see figure<br>
4D), which affords exchange of the variable heavy chain, the head-to-head promoter cassette,<br>
and the complete kappa chain from the pSymvcl2 to the mammalian expression vector<br>
(pSymvc21), thus allowing expression of the six selected antibodies as full length mouse<br>
IgGl antibodies.<br>
Genotyping of TGI cells transformed with plasmid preparations used in mass transfer<br>
TGI cells were transformed with the mini six library in bulk by electroporation and after an<br>
overnight incubation on 2xYT (Sigma Y 2627) plates, individual colonies were picked. in each<br>
experiment 180 colonies were picked and incubated in 96 well formats in 2xYT liquid medium<br>
for 4 hours. Aliquots of the cultures were diluted with water, denatured and used as template<br>
in PCR. in all experiments, the variable heavy chain was amplified. Primer sequences for the<br>
phagemid vectors (pSymvclO-type) were:<br>
5'-GCATTGACAGGAGGTTGAGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO 2) and<br>
5'-GCTGCCGACCGCTGCTGCTGGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO 3)<br>
Primers for vectors with mammalian promoter cassette were (pSymvcl2-type):<br>
5'-GCATTGACAGGAGGTTGAGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO 4) and<br>
5'-GTGTCCACTCTGAGGTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO 5)<br>
Primers for pSymvc21 constructs were:<br>
5'-CAAATAGCCCTTGACCAGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO 6) and<br>
5'-GTGTCCACTCTGAGGTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO 7)<br>
All PCR products were digested with both Nlalll and Hinfl to ensure unambiguous genoty-<br>
ping. The digestion fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and bands were<br>
visualized by EtBr staining. The number of individual genotypes resembled by the fragment<br>
pattern determined by RFLP corresponds to the number of individual colonies representing<br>
each of the six antibodies among the total number of picked colonies.<br>
(d.2a) Mass transfer from the phagemid vector to a mammalian vector after DNA amplification<br>
in E. coli cells (two-step amplification method)<br>
The Plasmid Preparation 1 was prepared from each of the six E. coli TGI glycerol stocks,<br>
containing one of the six phagemid vectors constituting the mini six library. The stocks were<br>
propagated individually, and after OD600 normalization for the number of E. coli, the six cultures<br>
were mixed in equal amounts and used for plasmid preparation resulting in Plasmid<br>
Preparation 1. The genotype distribution of the six phagemid vectors in Plasmid Preparation 1<br>
was tested by transformation into electrocompetent TGI cells and subsequent RFLP analysis.<br>
The distribution of the different genotypes in TGI cells is shown in Figure 5.<br>
The Plasmid Preparation 1 comprising the polyclonal phagemid vector expressing an equal<br>
mixture of the six selected Fab fragment genotypes was digested with Sacl/Xhol. Then the<br>
head-to-head promoter cassette (CMV promoter/MPSV promoter) was inserted by ligation.<br>
The genotype distribution of the vectors after the promoter exchange in the vector was<br>
tested in TGI cells after transformation with DNA from the ligation step (Figure 6).<br>
The cells were plated and grown on large (245mm x 245mm) 2x YT agar plates and the<br>
Plasmid Preparation 2 was prepared to generate the phagemid vector now containing the<br>
head-to-head promoter cassette (pSymvcl2).<br>
From the Plasmid Preparation 2, the variable heavy chain coding sequence, including the<br>
promoter cassette and the complete kappa chain sequence was cut out from the phagemid<br>
vector by a Notl/EcoRl digest and transferred into a vector (pSymvc20) already containing<br>
the constant region domains of mouse IgGl. This resulted in a collection of pSymvc21 vectors,<br>
which expresses the variable region of the six selected antibody clones as full-length<br>
mouse IgGl antibodies.<br>
The promoter transfer can alternatively be performed in the mammalian vector encoding an<br>
isotype, reversing the order of restriction digest starting with Notl/EcoRl for transfer of the<br>
DNA of interest to the mammalian vector and then Sacl/Xhol restriction digest fragment for<br>
insertion of the promoter region.<br>
The distribution of genotypes after transferring the variable heavy chain coding sequence, the<br>
promoter cassette and the whole kappa chain encoding sequence into the expression vector<br>
was tested by transforming TGI cells with DNA from the second ligation step (Figure 7). Cells<br>
were plated on large (245 mm x 245 mm) 2x YT agar plates and Plasmid Preparation 3 was<br>
prepared (pSymvc21), in which the variable region of the six clones are expressed in the<br>
context of a mouse IgGl antibody framework.<br>
The Plasmid Preparation 3 can be used for the bulk transfection of mammalian cells to generate<br>
a recombinant polyclonal manufacturing cell line for recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
expression.<br>
The results of the mass transfer from the phagemid vector to an isotype-encoding mammalian<br>
vector after DNA amplification in E. coli cells showed that it was possible to obtain a balanced<br>
distribution of the six vector constructs after they had been propagated individually<br>
and mixed (Plasmid Preparation 1, Figure 5). The six constructs, after exchange of promoter<br>
cassette (Plasmid Preparation 2, Figure 6) as well as after insertion into a mouse IgGl isotype-encoding<br>
vector (Plasmid Preparation 3, Figure 7), were all detectable at comparable<br>
levels.<br>
(d.2b) Mass transfer from a phagemid vector to a vector for mammalian expression without<br>
DNA amplification in E. coli after the Plasmid Preparation 1 step (one-step amplification<br>
method)<br>
DNA from the Plasmid Preparation 1 (here was used 25 ug) comprising the polyclonal<br>
phagemid vector (pSymvclO) expressing an equal mixture of the six selected Fab fragment<br>
genotypes was digested with Sacl/Xhol for exchange of promoters. The Sacl/Xhol vector<br>
fragment was purified and ligated with the head-to-head promoter cassette (CMV pro-<br>
moter/MPSV promoter). After the exchange of promoters without performing any amplification,<br>
the vector with CMV/MPSV promoter cassette was digested with Notl/EcoRl for cutting<br>
out the whole region with the variable heavy chain encoding sequence, including the promoter<br>
cassette and the entire kappa chain encoding sequence from the phagemid vector for<br>
mass transfer into a vector for mammalian expression. After ligating the Notl/EcoRl fragment<br>
encoding the variable heavy chain, the promoter cassette and the kappa chain into a mouse<br>
IgGl-encodlng vector (pSymvc20), an expression vector, which expresses the variable region<br>
of the six selected clones in the context of mouse IgGl full length antibodies was obtained.<br>
The composition of this expression vector is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
After the mass transfer resulting in the promoter exchange in the vector and transfer of the<br>
nucleotide sequences encoding the variable heavy chain, the promoter cassette and the complete<br>
kappa chain into a vector for mammalian expression, the distribution of genotypes was<br>
tested by transformation of TGI cells with plasmid from the second ligation step. Cells were<br>
plated on large (245 mm x 245 mm) 2xYT agar plates and a plasmid preparation of this<br>
double digestlon/ligation Plasmid Preparation was prepared (vector pSymvc21, in which the<br>
variable region of the six clones are expressed in the context of mouse IgGl antibodies, corresponding<br>
to Plasmid Preparation 3 from d.2a). The genotype distribution in TGI cells after<br>
transformation with the plasmid preparation from the one-step amplification method is shown<br>
in Figure 8.<br>
The one-step amplification method might introduce some scrambling among the heavy and<br>
light chains from the six Fab encoding sequences resulting from the generation of undesired<br>
ligation products, which are normally omitted during amplification in E.cali. However, if such<br>
scrambling occurs, a screening step can be introduced to ensure that sufficient clonal diversity<br>
is maintained.<br>
(d.2c) Direct transaction of mammalian cells following promoter exchange<br>
The product from the plasmid preparations of the mini six library from either the two-step<br>
amplification method or one-step amplification method can be used directly to transfect<br>
mammalian cells in bulk for recombinant polyclonal antibody expression.<br>
(d.3) Testing of the Transfected Mammalian Cells<br>
The known antibody combination of the mini six polyclonal model system can be used to test<br>
and ensure that the mass transfer and transfection into mammalian cells occur in a way that<br>
maintains the clonal diversity and without introducing bias in the composition of the antibody<br>
variable sequence genotypes during transfection and subsequent culturing. The methods by<br>
which the genotypic composition will be monitored throughout the process of mass transfer,<br>
bulk transfection and mammalian expression, can comprise the following:<br>
- DNA sequencing of isolated clones<br>
- RFLP analysis of individual clones<br>
- ELISA of the produced antibody mixture<br>
- Mass spectrometry of the produced antibody mixture<br>
- Taqman PCR of the relative composition of the genomlc sequences and mRNA expressing<br>
the different heavy and light chains<br>
Deviations in the genotypic composition introduced during the transfection process, should<br>
they occur, could be caused by random integration or multiple integrants. As described in the<br>
detailed description it is not likely to cause problems when using a host cell line pre-designed<br>
for site-specific integration. However, it can be controlled in a variety of ways. Selection<br>
against integration in a random genomic location (a location other than the site-specific location)<br>
may be done using very low quantities of DNA, e.g., ltig/107 celis when performing<br>
transfection with Lipofectamine or Q.2ng/107 cells when performing transfection by electro-<br>
poration. Also, the DNA to be integrated may be supplied in supercoiled form; a form known<br>
to be unfavorable for random integration.<br>
Single or multiple integrations outside of the pre-designed target site will be eliminated by<br>
negative selection, because the selectable marker will be present in the genome without a<br>
promoter or a start codon. Thus, recipients of these random integration events do not survive<br>
the selection process.<br>
Transformants having multiple integrations where one of the recombination events occurs at<br>
the target site will survive the selection process; however, the probability of this type of multiple<br>
integrations is extremely low. This event would, therefore, lead to minimal scrambling of<br>
the polyclonal protein. Further, because there would be 100 to 1000 other clones encoding<br>
the same recombinant polyclonal protein, even if ectopic expression is high, the scrambling<br>
effect would be less than about 1% if multiple integrations occurred. As mentioned previously,<br>
the probability of ectopic integration can be reduced by reducing the quantity of DNA<br>
used in the method.<br>
The least likely event Is a multiple tandem integration at the target site. Using the Flp recombinase<br>
system described here, this type of event will be rare because the excision activity<br>
from the chromosome is significantly higher than the integration activity. However, should<br>
tandem integration occur at an unacceptably high frequency, the Flp system can be ex-<br>
changed for one in which only a single copy insert Is possible (see, for example, WO<br>
99/25854; incorporated by reference).<br>
(e) Expression of the six distinct antibodies in known combination in mammalian cells<br>
Generally in order to minimize variable proliferation rates, it is preferable to integrate each<br>
specific GOI (in this case each individual member of the mini six library) into at least 100,<br>
preferably 1000 and most preferred into 10000 cells. A polyclonal cell line containing a large<br>
number of individual cells expressing the same GOI (for all the GOI's) is statistically expected<br>
to be less influenced by differences in proliferation rates of individual cells and have reduced<br>
possibility of bias in the final polyclonal protein composition.<br>
Further, it might be an advantage to ensure a homogeneous host cell line for the expression.<br>
This can be achieved by sub-cloning the host cell line prior to trasfection. This process is described<br>
in the paragraph regarding clonal diversity.<br>
For poiyclonal libraries in which further bias control is desirable, the final composition of the<br>
polyclonal protein product can be controlled by introducing an inducibie transcriptional control<br>
element into the expression vector platform. Suitable inducibie control elements include, for<br>
example, BD Tet on/off (BD Biosdence, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and GeneSwitch (invltrogen,<br>
Carlsbad, CA). These transcriptional switches can be induced at an appropriate time point<br>
(e.g., when the pool of cells is fully expanded) to minimize any proliferation bias due to<br>
variation in gene expression or the protein product. The present experiment was not performed<br>
with such control elements.<br>
After transferring the six selected GOI from the phagemid vector to the mammalian expression<br>
vectors, either individually as described in (d.l) or by mass transfer as described in<br>
(d.2), the mammalian expression vectors were used for transfection into a hot spot in a CHO-<br>
Flp-in cell line by using site-specific integration for expressing the six distinct antibodies as<br>
described below.<br>
For the individually transferred GOI (d.l), plasmid DNA's were propagated individually and<br>
used for individual transfection into CHO Flp-in cells or the TGI stocks were propagated individually,<br>
and after OD600 normalization for numbers of E. coli cells, the six cultures were<br>
mixed and used for plasmid preparation. This plasmid preparation containing the six genes of<br>
interest was used for bulk transfection of mammalian cells for recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
expression.<br>
For the mass transferred GOI (d.2a or d.2b) plasmld DNA's are either transfected into CHO-<br>
Flp-in cells or ampllfled and purified (Plasmid Preparation 3) according to the procedure described<br>
in (d.2a or d2.b) and then used for bulk transfection.<br>
(e.l) Cell culture<br>
The CHO Flp-in host cell line (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was maintained in Ham's F-12 medium,<br>
with the addition of glutamine (2 mM) and FCS (10%) and 100 ng/mJ Zeodn (invitrogen,<br>
Carlsbad, CA). For sub-culturing, the cells were detached by trypsln and split according<br>
to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown at 5% CO2, 37"C. Medium and medium additives<br>
were from Gibco.<br>
This cell line stably expresses the lacZ-Zeodn fusion gene, rendering the cells resistant to the<br>
antibiotic Zeodn, a resistance that upon site-specific integration of a foreign gene will be lost.<br>
The cells contain a single copy of the Flp Recombination Target (FRT) site, and are thus ready<br>
to be used as host cell line for site-directed integration by use of the Flp-in system (invitrogen,<br>
Carlsbad, CA).<br>
(e.2) Transfection of CHO cells<br>
Tissue culture plates with 6 wells were inoculated with 4.0 x 10s CHO-Flp-in cells/ well, and<br>
incubated O/N at 37°C / 5 % CO2. Transfection of these cells was performed testing different<br>
transfection methods using FuGENE™6 (Roche), Lipofectine™, LipofectAmine™, or Lipofec-<br>
tAMINE 2000™ (Gibco) according to the manufacturer's instructions. in this example, Lipo-<br>
fecAMlNE 2000™ was used as transfection reagent. Briefly, on the day before the transfection,<br>
exponentially growing CHO-Flp-in cells were seeded as described above and incubated<br>
O/N at 37°C / 5 % CO2. Wells with an 85-95 % cell confluence were used for the co-transfection.<br>
Two tubes with the following contents were prepared:<br>
Tube 1: 0.5 ug of an individual expression vector with GOI described in (d.l) (e.g.,<br>
pSymvc21 with OVA) + 4.5 ug mpO4O (a maxi preparation of pOG44) (a plasmid expressing<br>
recombinase Flp) were added to 250 ul Optimem (1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes).<br>
Tube 2: 7.5 ul LipofectAMlNE 2000™ was added to 250 ul Optimem (1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes)<br>
and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.<br>
The content of tube 2 was transferred to tube 1 followed by incubation at RT for 20 min.<br>
The DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were transferred to the wells with cells according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
After 24 h, the cells were detached by trypsin, split (1:3) and distributed to a T-25 flask and<br>
to 100 mm petri dishes and cultivated in fresh Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham + 10% FCS + 2<br>
mM L-Glutamine medium with 900 pg Hygromydn B/mt as selection pressure.<br>
(e.3) Selection of site-speciftc integrants and sub-cultivation of transacted cells<br>
Cells were cultivated under Hygromycin B selection pressure for two to three weeks, in this<br>
period cells were refreshed every 2 to 4 days with new medium containing the same concentration<br>
of selecting agent. The surviving pool of cells in the T-25 flask and in Petri dishes<br>
were detached by trypsin, split (1:6) and distributed to T-fiasks for further propagation under<br>
the above mentioned selection pressure. Some single clones were picked (using so-called<br>
doning cylinders) from the Petri dishes containing the transfectants generated according to<br>
the method described in (d.l), and transferred to new wells for propagation and use in expression<br>
level studies.<br>
Each pool of cells or single clones, that was resistant to the threshold Hygromydn B concentration,<br>
was subsequently grown to confluence in 6-well plates, replated in Petri dishes, T-25,<br>
T-80 and T-175 flasks in their respective medium plus Hygromycin B. When exponentially<br>
growing cells reached 80% confluence in T80 tissue culture flasks, vials of each cell line were<br>
frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen N2(L)- freezer.<br>
For transfection with a mixture of plasmids containing the six genes of interest (the mini six<br>
library), the six individual cultures were normalized at OD600for numbers of E. coli, mixed and<br>
used for a polyclonal plasmid preparation containing the six genes of interest. A transfection<br>
procedure using 7.5 times as much of the reagents and cells described above was carried<br>
out, producing a recombinant polyclonal cell line expressing a mixture of the six distinct antibodies.<br>
The six cell lines expressing individual members of the selected antibodies and the ceil line<br>
expressing the mixture of the six distinct antibodies were during cultivation and propagation<br>
tested for antibody production by antigen-specific ELISA.<br>
(f) Monitoring the composition of a polyclonal cell line expressing six distinct antibodies of<br>
known combination<br>
By generating a mixture of the six selected genes of interest situated in expression vectors<br>
followed by bulk transfection and site-specific integration into CHO-Flp-in cells, a polyclonal<br>
cell line expressing six distinct antibodies was generated.<br>
The cell line was followed for 34 days in which genotype distribution, antibody expression and<br>
proliferation rates were followed. Results are described below.<br>
(f.1) Genotype distribution of the six selected genes of interest in CHQ-Flp-in cells trans-<br>
fected with the plasmid preparation from the ODeoo normalized mixture of cells.<br>
The polyclonal CHO-Flp-in cell line was trypsinized and the cell suspension diluted to 10<br>
cells/ml. Hereafter, 200 nl were transferred to each well of a total of ten 96-well plates. Approximately<br>
10 days later, wells with single colonies were identified by microscopy. Wells with<br>
single colonies were washed lx in PBS and 50 yl water was added. Plates were incubated at<br>
80 °C for 10 mln and lysates were transferred to another 96-weii plate. Ten ml of the lysates<br>
were used in 25 ml OneStep RT-PCR (Qiagen) with the following primers:<br>
5'-CAAATAGCCCTTGACCAGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO 6) and<br>
5'-GTGTCCACTCTGAGGTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO 7)<br>
RFLP was performed using Hinfl and W/alll on 10 ul of RT-PCR mixtures in 15 ml reactions<br>
that were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours. The digestion fragments were visualized using<br>
agarose gel electrophoresis followed by EtBr staining of the gel. The genotype distribution of<br>
cells producing anti- OVA, anti-AP, anti-p2m, anti-HAP, anti-FVIII, and anti-LYS was followed<br>
over time (days 16 and 34 after transfection), see Figure 9.<br>
(f.2) ELISA of samples derived from CHO-Flp-in cells transfected with the plasmid prepara-<br>
tion from the OD600 normalized mixture of E. coti (d.l)<br>
The polyclonal CHO-Flp-in cell line (e.3) was trypsinized and 3 x 106 cells were plated in T-75<br>
flasks in F-12 HAM + 10% FCS + 2 mM L-glutamine and 900 mg hygromycin. Medium was<br>
changed every day and at day 3 supernatants were selected for ELISA. Antigens, (b2-micro-<br>
globulin (a gift from University of Copenhagen), alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), ovalbumin<br>
(Sigma), factor VIII (a gift from Novo Nordisk, Denmark), hen egg white lysozyme (Sigma),<br>
and haptoglobin (Sigma)) were diluted in 50 mM carbonate buffer to .10 mg/ml. ELISA plates<br>
were coated with antigen (50 ml to each well) and incubated O/N at 4 °C. Wells were washed<br>
4 times with washing buffer (lx PBS/0.05% Tween 20) and blocked for 1 hour with 2% skim<br>
milk powder in washing buffer (100 ml to each well). 50 ml samples were added to the wells<br>
and plates incubated for 1 hour at RT. Plates were washed 4x and secondary antibodies (Goat<br>
anti-mouse IgG/HRP conjugate (Sigma)) were added for 1 hour followed by 4x wash. The<br>
ELISA was developed with TMB substrate (50 ixl in each well, DAKO S1600) for 5 min and<br>
reactions stopped by adding 50 nl 1 M H2SO4. Plates were read immediately at 450 nm. Data<br>
demonstrating expression of all six antibodies of interest in lysates derived on day 34 post-<br>
transfection with the mixture of expression vectors encoding the six genes of interest is<br>
shown in Figure 10. It should be noted that since the data presented in Figure 10 is derived<br>
from six different antigen-specific ELISA assays, the OD450 readings are not directly comparable<br>
in terms of antibody quantity.<br>
Antibody expression levels were further analyzed by anti-kappa coat EUSA in pools of CHO-<br>
Flp-in cells transfected with each individual GOI or the mixture of the six GOI. The result is<br>
shown in Figures 11. This shows that the antibody expression levels are comparable among<br>
the individually transfected cell lines (e.g. a cell line transfected with an anti-p2m encoding<br>
vector expresses a comparable amount of antibody compared to a cell line transfected with a<br>
vector encoding anti-AP antibody). The term pools of CHO-Flp-in cells transfected with individual<br>
GOI, is used here because the individual cell lines are not derived from single clones,<br>
but pools of clones as described in e.3.<br>
(g) Conclusions from the experiment<br>
Firstly, these evaluations (tests) of preservation of the polyclonality in the manufacturing<br>
system showed that mass transfer of the six selected genes of interest from the mini six library<br>
(encoding anti-OVA, antl-AP, anti-p2m, anti-HAP, anti-FVIII, and anti-LYS) from<br>
phagemid vectors into mammalian expression vectors was possible without introduction of<br>
selection or proliferation bias (Figure 7), thereby ending up with comparable frequencies of<br>
the six selected genes of interest.<br>
Secondly, bulk transfection of CHO-Flp-in cells with a mixture of the constructs containing the<br>
six selected genes of interest also resulted in comparable distribution of the constructs in<br>
isolated mammalian cells. The genotype distributions of the six selected genes of interest<br>
over time (day 16 and 34 after transfection) were also similar (Figure 9), indicating that the<br>
expression system up to day 34 maintained the original, equal distribution of the six genotypes,<br>
without introducing proliferation bias.<br>
Thirdly, the cells transfected in bulk with the mixture of the six genes of interest showed expression<br>
of all six antibodies, as examined by antigen-specific ELISA on supernatants from<br>
cells 34 days after transfection (Figure 10). The ELISA results for the different antigens are<br>
not directly comparable in terms of antibody amounts, due to different binding affinities.<br>
However, a capture ELISA based on coating with goat anti-mouse kappa chain antibody performed<br>
on supernatants from a) the six individually transfected CHO-Flp-in cell lines generated<br>
using the vector preparation as described in (d.l) and b) on supernatants of the polyclonal<br>
cell line expressing a mixture of the six selected genes of interest showed comparable<br>
antibody expression levels from the six genotypes.<br>
in summary, it has been demonstrated that it is feasible to transfer a polyclonal GOI in mass<br>
from a phagemid vector to a mammalian expression vector. This has previously been described<br>
by Sharon (US 5,789,208). Furthermore, a mixture of mammalian expression constructs<br>
could be transfected into mammalian cells in bulk and maintained at a comparable<br>
frequency at least up to day 34 post-transfection.<br>
EXAMPLE 3A<br>
Evaluation of potyclonality preservation in cell cultures generated by bulk transfection of a<br>
sub-clone from the CHO-Flp-in cell fine with the mini six library.<br>
(a) Sub-cloning of "original" CHO Flp-in cell line<br>
The original CHO Flp-in cell line (invitrogen) was cultured as described (Example 3 section<br>
e.l). After trypsination cells were counted and plated with \ cell per well in a 96-well culture<br>
plate. Approximately 14 days later 20 wells with single colonies were identified and cells were<br>
trypsinated and transferred to 24-well plates. One of the sub-clones, CHO-Flp-in clone 019,<br>
was selected for future studies after characterization of growth behavior as well as expression<br>
levels.<br>
(b) Bulk transfection and selection of CHO-Flp-in clone 019 cells<br>
Transfection was performed in triplicate, and selection of the CHO-Flp-in clone 019 cells were<br>
essential carried out as described (Example 3, section e.2 and e.3), with the exception that a<br>
Neomycin selection marker replaced the Hygromycin marker in pSymvc21 (figure 4.e). Consequently,<br>
Geniticin (450 ug/ml) was used instead of Hygromycin B during selection and cultivation<br>
of the cells.<br>
(c) ELISA of samples obtained from CHO Flp-in clone 019 cells transfected in bulk with the<br>
mini six library<br>
The cells were cultured for 73 days post transfection and samples for ELISA were taken at<br>
day 17, 31, 45, 59 and 73. A quantitative EUSA (using individually purified mini six antibodies<br>
as standards) was performed as described (Example 3, section, f.2). The results from<br>
three independent transfections are shown in figure 12. Different expression profiles between<br>
different transfections were observed. However, all six antibodies were detectable in all experiments<br>
up to day 59.<br>
(d) Conclusion from the experiment<br>
Experiments with the Neomycin selection system on CHO Flp-in clone 019 ceils showed relatively<br>
preserved expression profiles of individual batches, for two months after bulk transfection<br>
(figure 12). Such a period of stability is sufficient for manufacturing purposes. The batch<br>
to batch variation observed can be dealt with by generating and banking a large freezing<br>
stock of the individual batch prior to production.<br>
EXAMPLE 3B<br>
Evaluation of polyclonality preservation in cell cultures generated by mixing individually<br>
transfected CHO Flp-in cells after selection.<br>
(a) individual transfection and selection of CHO-Flp-in cells<br>
The experimental procedures for generation of the six cell lines expressing the individual<br>
members of the mini six library has been described previously (Example 3, section e.3). The<br>
six cell lines expressing individual members of the mini six library were mixed immediately<br>
after selection in equal numbers (5x105 of each cell line) and the mixed cell population was<br>
cultivated for 85 days. Three separate mixtures were made from the individual cell lines.<br>
(b) ELISA of samples obtained from polyclonal cell cultures generated in (a)<br>
Samples were taken every fortnight and the composition of the antibodies expressed from<br>
the mini six library was determined by EUSA as described (Example 3, section f.2). ELISA<br>
was performed at day 8, 17, 30, 45, 57, 72 and 85 after the mixing. The results (mean ± SD<br>
of triplicate experiment) are shown in figure 13. All six antibodies were detectable 85 day<br>
post mixing. As previously mentioned (Example 3, section f.2), the readings for different antibodies<br>
were not directly comparable but data presented in figure 13 shows relatively stable<br>
expression profiles at least up to day 45 after mixing, after which a general drop in productivity<br>
is observed. Furthermore, comparison of results obtained from three independent mixes<br>
showed similar expression profiles over time of the mini six antibodies indicating that the<br>
results were reproducible.<br>
(c) Conclusion from the experiments<br>
Polyclonal cell cultures composed of mixtures of cells transfected individually with distinct<br>
members of the mini six library showed compositional preservation at least up to day 45 after<br>
mixing. A compositional preservation for 45 days will in most cases be sufficient time for<br>
manufacturing purposes. Furthermore, triplicate experiments gave similar results, thereby<br>
indicating that mixing of cells transfected individually with different constructs results in<br>
mixed cell cultures with low batch to batch variation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Establishment of an anti-ovalbumin recomblnant polyclonal antibody manufacturing cell line<br>
(a) Expression of an anti-ovalbumin polyclonal antibody composition<br>
A collection of fully characterized ovalbumin-binding phage clones has been identified as follows.<br>
Four eight-week old female BALB/c mice were immunized i.p. and s.c. with 50 mg OVA<br>
in complete Freunds Adjuvant and boosted with OVA in incomplete Freunds adjuvant at days<br>
21 and 42 after immunization day 0, and it was confirmed that all animals had sera converted<br>
against OVA, as measured by an antigen-specific EUSA. Spleens were harvested from<br>
the best responding mice at days 31 and 52. Fab-displaying phagemid libraries were generated<br>
from splenic RNA, using the phagemid vector (SymvclO) as previously described. The<br>
resulting libraries contained approximately 106 independent clones. Selection of these libraries<br>
was performed by reacting 5 x 1011 Fab-displaying phagemids with OVA coated on NUNC<br>
immunotubes, followed by washing and acid elution of binding phages, As eluates from the<br>
first round of panning contained a significant proportion of OVA binders, eluates from first<br>
and second rounds of panning were screened for OVA-binding phage clones.<br>
initially, OVA-reactive phage clones were identified by EUSA. in brief, ELISA plates were<br>
coated with OVA and reacted with the phage-displayed Fabs, followed by an HRP-conjugated<br>
secondary antibody. For negative controls, irrelevant antigens (BSA) or irrelevant phage-dls-<br>
played Fabs (anti-AP) were used.<br>
in addition, a HDS method, based on OVA immobilization on PVDF membranes, was established.<br>
These two methods resulted in the identification of separate subsets of clones, i.e.<br>
some clones that recognized OVA in one set-up and not in the other and vice versa. For Fab-<br>
dlsplaylng phage clones that reacted with OVA by either ELJSA or HDS, the nudeotide sequence<br>
encoding the variable domain of the VH was determined by DNA sequencing, and the<br>
genetic diversity was estimated by phylogenetic analysis, using the Vector NTI software<br>
package. The resulting panel includes 127 OVA-binding clones, for all of which the nudeotide<br>
sequences of the variable part of the VH have been established.<br>
Fab fragments expressed by the 127 OVA-binding clones all have the ability to bind to oval-<br>
bumin either in native or denatured form. From this set we have identified approximately 30<br>
different clones contained in a phagemid vector, e.g., pSymvclO, to be used for mass transfer<br>
and mammalian expression. These antibodies are expressed either in the form of mouse<br>
IgA, IgG2A or lgG2B antibodies. Because we have fully characterized the DNA sequences of<br>
these antibody producing clones, we are able to monitor the distribution of the genotypes<br>
throughout the mass transfer and mammalian expression procedure using the same methods<br>
as used for the model system with the six distinct antibodies described in example 3.<br>
(b) Mass transfer of the OVA-specific antibody sequences to a vector for mammalian expression<br>
The transfer of genes of interest from a phagemid vector to an expression vector is a two<br>
step procedure (illustrated in Figure 4), where the first step, is exchange of promoters with<br>
the promoter cassette with head-to-head orientation of the selected mammalian promoters,<br>
this is followed by transferring the variable region of the genes of interest and the promoter<br>
cassette to an expression vector. The head-to-head promoter cassette (promoter A/ promoter<br>
B) can be inserted into the phagemid vector of each clone by using a Sacl/Xhol digest<br>
followed by a ligation resulting in exchange of promoters from bacterial to mammalian promoter<br>
(pSymvcl2).<br>
An EcoRl and Notl digest will then move the sequences encoding the variable heavy chain,<br>
the head-to-head promoter cassette (promoter A/ promoter B) and the complete kappa chain<br>
from the phagemid vector (pSymvcl2) into an isotype-encoding vector, pSymvc20. The<br>
pSymvc20 vector can accept any Notl/EcoRl fragment from the phagemid vector. This fragment<br>
would transfer the sequence encoding the variable heavy chain to connect with the<br>
constant heavy chain sequences in pSymvc20 as well as the entire sequence encoding the<br>
kappa chain to be connected with bGH PolyA sequence. This mass transfer will result in expression<br>
vectors as shown in Figure 1, which express the variable heavy regions and the entire<br>
kappa chains as mouse IgG2B antibodies after the mass transfer.<br>
The vector, pSymvc20, can contain the mouse constant regions of the heavy chain of the<br>
IgA, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgE or IgGl genes, and is thus capable of expressing any of the relevant<br>
mouse immunoglobulln Isotypes of choice.<br>
(c) Expression of an anti-ovalbumin recombinant polyclonal antibody<br>
By mass transfer, the sequences encoding the variable region of the heavy chain, the promoters<br>
and the entire kappa chain are moved from a phage vector library to isotype-enco-<br>
ding vectors resulting in a polyclonal mammalian expression vector composition. This is followed<br>
by transfection and site-specific integration into a CHO-Flp-in cell line, generating a<br>
recombinant polyclonal antibody manufacturing cell line. This latter cell line is generated by<br>
targeting the gene of interest encoding each member of the recombinant polyclonal protein<br>
into the same specific location in the genome of each transfected cell, and at the same time<br>
integrating only one copy of the expression construct containing said nucleic acid sequence in<br>
each transfected cell.<br>
The cell cultures and the transfection and selection procedure is the same as described in<br>
example 3 (e.l-e.3).<br>
(d) monitoring composition stability<br>
To ensure that the mass transfer and transfection into mammalian cells occur without introduction<br>
of considerable bias with regard to cloning, expression and diversity among the individual<br>
clones the process of mass transfer and mammalian expression can be monitored with<br>
the following methods:<br>
1) Analysis of generation time of the pools of cells from each transfected construct,<br>
2) Analysis of expression level of the pools of celts from each transfected construct,<br>
3) Analysis by RFLP on single cells,<br>
4) ELISA of the produced antibody mixture,<br>
5) Mass spectrometry of the produced antibody mixture,<br>
6) Analysis by Taqman PCR (real-time PCR) on a defined batch size using V region-specific<br>
primers to identify ratio's of each different clone, or<br>
7) Analysis of the batch over time cultivated with and without selection pressure (hygromy-<br>
cin) can be performed for the following parameters:<br>
a) clonal distribution<br>
b) protein expression levels (quantity and distribution)<br>
c) genomic stability<br>
d) effects of adaptation to serum-free media.<br>
(e ) Production of an anti-ovalbumin recombinant polyclonal antibody composition<br>
The recombinant polyclonal antibody producing CHO-Flp-in cell line is grown in different culture<br>
systems, including conventional small culture flasks, Nunc multilayer cell factories, and<br>
small high yield bloreactors (MiniPerm, INTEGRA-CELLJne). Further, the cell lines are adapted<br>
to serum free suspension for subsequent cultivation in spinner flasks, hollow fibers, and bio-<br>
reactors.<br>
The media used to grow the selected cell lines are serum free, protein free or chemically defined<br>
media as recommended by the manufacturer (invitrogen, B&amp;D, Hyclone).<br>
Supernatants from attached or suspension cells that are cultured without selection (hygromy-<br>
cin) are collected. The collected supernatants are analyzed and characterized as described<br>
(3f). Production yields, functionality, and quality of the produced antibodies are checked<br>
during and after growth of the cells under fed batch or perfusion conditions. Cells in suspension<br>
are used for inoculation of larger spinner flasks or bioreactors.<br>
The polyclonal antibody from the collected supernatants is purified for later use in animal<br>
studies.<br>
