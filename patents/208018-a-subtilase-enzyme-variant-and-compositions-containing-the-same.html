Title:  Protease Variants and Compositions TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates tp novel mutant protease enzymes or enzyme variants useful in formulating detergent compositions and exhibiting improved wash performance in detergents; cleaning and detergent compositions containing said enzymes; mutated genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the: detergent industry enzymes have for more than 3 0 years been iiiplemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially<br><br>
mo<br><br>
t iikportant enzymes are proteases.<br><br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurr'ing wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM® (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE® (Novo Nordisk A/S), MAXAPEM® (Gist-Brocades N.V.), PURAFECT® (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
. Further a number of protease variants are describe in the art, such as in EP 130756 (GENENTECH) (corresponding to US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR)); EP 214435 (HENKEL); WO 87/04461 (AMGEN); WO 87/05050 (GENEX); EP 260105 (GENENCOR); Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1985) Nature 318 375-376; Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193 803-813; Russel and Fersht Nature 328 496-500 (1987); WO 88/08028 (Genex); WO 88/08033 (Alrtgen); WO 95/27049 (SOLVAY S.A.); WO 95/30011 (PROCTER Si GAMBLE COMPANY); WO 95/30010 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); WO 95/29979 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); US 5.543,302 (SOLVAY S.A.); EP 251 446 (GENENCOR); WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S); WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S); EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY); and Wo 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.).<br><br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved protease variants for a number of industrial uses.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved protein engineered protease variants, especially for use in the detergent industry.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Original amino acid(s) position(s) substituted amino acid(s)<br><br>
According to this the substitution of Glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
	Glyl95Glu or   G195E<br>
a deletion of glycine in the same position is:<br>
	Glyl95        or   G195*<br>
and insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as lysine is:<br>

This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to a<br>
conservative  amino  acid  modification(s)  of  a  preferred<br>
subtilase variants of the invention.<br>
E.g.   a conservative amino acid modification(s) of e.g.<br>
a preferred variant Tyrl67Ala + Argl70Ser are<br>
Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser, or Thr} -f Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser, or Thr},<br>
which here substitute a small amino acid to another small amino<br>
acid. See section "Detailed description of the invention" for<br>
further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
i Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br>
If ho other mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein<br>
correspond to that of the subtilase BPN" (BASBPN) sequence. For<br><br><br>
further description of the BPN sequence see Siezen et al., Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737 and Figure 1.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residiie at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Prindiples of Biochemistry," Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272) .<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Daltons range. They are inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological    Rev.   41 711-753).<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al,, Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 40 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases have been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al.  and figure' 1 herein.<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-Sl, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168, subtilisin BPN', subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and subtilisin DY.<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases I-S2, is recognised by Siezen et al. (supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprise<br><br>
I<br>
enzymes such as subtilisln PB92 (MAXACAL*, Gist-Brocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE®, NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtillsin 147 (ESPERASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB.<br>
"SAVINASE®"<br>
SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S.<br>
It is subtilisin 309 from B. Lentus and differs from BABP92 only in having N87S (see figure 1 herein).<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term "parent subtilase" is a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (Protein Engineering 4:719-737 (1991)). For further details see description of "SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modification have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Alternatively the term "parent subtilase" may be termed "wild-type subtilase".<br>
Modification's) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term "modification(s)" used in connection with modification (s) of a subtilase variant as discussed herein is defined to include chemical modification as well as genetic manipulation. The modification(s) can be by substitution, deletion and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Homolocfous subtilase sequences<br><br>
Specific  amino  acid  residues  of  SAVINASE®  subtilase  are<br>
identified for modification herein to obtain  a  subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to modifications of this particular subtilase, but extend to other parent (wild-type) subtilases, which have a homologous primary structure to<br>
that of SAVINASE®.<br>
In order to identify other homologous subtilases, within the scope of this invention, an alignment of said subtilase(s) to a group of previously aligned subtilases is performed keeping the previous alignment constant. A comparison to 18 highly conserved residues in subtilases is performed. The 18 highly conserved residues are shown in table I (see Siezen et al. for further details relating to said conserved residues).<br>
Table I<br>
18 highly conserved residues in subtilases<br>
Position:	Conserved residue<br>
23	G<br>
32	D<br>
34	G<br>
t<br>
39	H<br>
64	H<br>
65	G<br>
66	T<br>

155	N . 219	G<br><br>
220	T<br>
221	S 225                 p<br><br>
After aligning  allowing for necessary insertions and<br>
deletions  in  order  to  maintain  the  alignment  suitable<br>
homologous residues are identified. Said homologous residues<br>
can then be modified according to the invention.<br>
Using the CLUSTALW (version 1.5, April 1995) computer I alignment program (Thompson, J.D., Higgins, D.G. and Gibson,<br>
T.J.  (i994) Nucleic Acids Research, 22:4673-4680.), with GAP<br>
open penalty of 10.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1, using<br>
the BEOSUM30 protein weight matrix,  alignment of a given<br>
subtilase to a group of previously aligned subtilases is<br>
achieved using the Profile   alignments   option in the program.<br>
For a given subtilase to be within the scope of the invention,<br>
preferably 100% of the 18 highly conserved residues should be<br>
conserved. However, alignment of greater than or equal to 17<br>
out of the 18 residues, or as little as 16 of said conserved<br>
residues is also adequate to identify homologous residues.<br>
Conservation  of  the,   in   subtilases,   catalytic   triad<br>
Asp32/His64/Ser221 should be maintained.<br>
The previously defined alignment is shown figure 1, where the percent identity of the individual subtilases in this alignment to the 18 highly conserved residues are shown too.<br>
Further in said process to identify a homologous parent (wild-type) subtilase within the scope of the invention, the 18 conserved residues above relates to the parent (wild-type) primary sequence of said homologous parent subtilase- In order words, if a parent subtilase have been modified in any of said 18 conserved residues above, it is the original parent wild-type sequence in said 18 conserved residues, which determine whether or not both the original parent subtilase and a possible variant of said parent subtilase, which are modified in any of said 18 conserved residues above, are a homologous subtilase within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases and corresponding homologous residues, which can be modified according to the invention. To illustrate this table II below<br><br>
shows a limited list a homologous subtilases and corresponding suitable residues to be modified according to the invention•<br><br>
It is obvious that a similar or larger table covering other homologous subtilases may easily be produced by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Wash performance<br>
The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various naturally occurring substrates present on the objects to be cleaned during e.g. wash is often referred to as its washing ability, wash-ability, detergency, or wash performance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a DNA sequence molecule, denotes that the DNA sequence has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems.  Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones.  Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are<br><br>
free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but; may include naturally occurring 5' and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators.  The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of or-<br>
dinaryi skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985).  The term "an isolated DNA sequence" may alternatively be termed "a cloned DNA sequence".<br>
 Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein is found in a condition other than its native environment.  In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)).  It is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 40% pure, greater than 60% pure, greater than 80% pure, more preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>

PRODUCING MUTATIONS IN SUBTILASE GENES<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase of the invention and for introducing mutations into genes (e.g. subtilase genes) are well known in the art.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing mutations (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention. For further description of suitable techniques reference is made to working examples herein {vide infra)   and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual,<br><br>
Cold Spring Harbor lab.. Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and sons, 1990); and WO 96/34946.<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA- In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable prompters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus stearothermophilus  maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus licheniformis  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus subtilis alkalihe protease gen, or the Bacillus pumilus  xylosidase gene,<br><br>
or the phage Lambda PR or PL promoters or the E. coli Lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
I The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
 The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).<br>
HOST QELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably<br><br>
connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
TJae host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-pbsitive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,   such as strains of B. subtilis,  B. licheniformis,  B. lentus,  B. jbrevls, B. stearothermophilus,   B. alkalophilus,   B. amyloliquefaciens, B. coagulans,   B. circularise   B. lautus,   B. megatbBrium  or B. thuringiensis,   or strains of Streptomyces,   such as S.   lividans or iS. murinu,   or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichia coli.   The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by using competent cells in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E.   coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the<br><br>
extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING SUBTILASE<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell, which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme pf the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells iin question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulphate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>

mixtures. Silicones can generally be represented by alkylated<br>
polysiloxane materials, while silica is normally used in finely<br>
divided forms exemplified by silica aerogels and xerogels and<br>
hydrophobic silicas of various types. Theses materials can be<br>
i incorporated as particulates, in which the suds suppressor is<br>
advantageously releasably incorporated in a water-soluble or<br>
waterdjispersible, substantially non surface-active detergent<br>
imperm.eable carrier. Alternatively the suds suppressor can be<br>
dissolved or dispersed in a liquid carrier and applied by<br>
spraying on to one or more of the other components.<br>
A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is disclosed<br>
in US 3,933,672. Other particularly useful suds suppressors are<br>
the self-emulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in<br>
German Patent Application DTOS 2,646,126. An example of such a<br><br>
compound is DC-544, commerC1ally available form Dow Corning, which is a siloxane-glycol copolymer. EspeC1ally preferred suds controlling agent are the suds suppressor system comprising a mixture of silicone oils and 2-alkyl-alkanols. Suitable 2-alkyl-alkanols are 2-butyl-octanol which are commerC1ally available under the trade name Isofol 12 R.<br>
Such suds suppressor system are described in European Patent Application EP 0 593 841.<br>
Esecially preferred silicone suds controlling agents are described in European Patent Application No. 92201649.8. Said compositions can comprise a silicone/ silica mixture in combinatioh with fumed nonporous silica such as Aerosil.<br>
The suds suppressors described above are normally employed at levels of from 0.001% to 2% by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.01% to 1% by weight.<br>
Other components; Other components used in detergent compositions may be employed such as soil-suspending agents, soil-releasing agents, optical brighteners, abrasives, bacteriC1des, tarnish inhibitors, coloring agents, and/or encapsulated or nonencapsulated perfumes.<br>
EspeC1ally suitable encapsulating materials are water soluble capsules which consist of a matrix of polysaccharide and polyhydroxy compounds such as described in GB 1,464,616.<br>
Other suitable water soluble encapsulating materials comprise dextrirjs derived from ungelatinized starch acid esters of substituted c^icarboxylic acids such as described in US 3,455/838. These acid-ester dextrins are, preferably, prepared from ^uch starches as waxy maize, waxy sorghum, sago, tapioca and potato. Suitable examples of said encapsulation materials include N-Lok manufactured by National Starch. The N-Lok encapsulating material consists of a modified maize starch and glucose. The starch is modified by adding monofunctional substituted groups such as octenyl sucC1nic acid anhydride.<br>
Antiredeposition and soil suspension agents suitable herein include cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose, and homo- or co-polymeric polycarboxylic acids or their salts. Polymers of<br><br><br><br>
particular preferred polymer in accordance with EP 0 272 033 has the formula:<br>
(CH3(PEG)43)o,75(POH)o.25[T-PO)2.8(T-PEG)o.4]T(POH) 0.25 ( (PEG) 43CH3) 0.75<br>
where PEG is -(OC2H4)0-, PO is (OC3H6O) and T is (POOC6H4CO) .<br>
Also very useful are modified polyesters as random copolymers of dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl<br>
sulfoisophthalate, ethylene glycol and 1,2-propanediol, the end groups consisting primarily of sulphobenzoate and secondarily of mono esters of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol. The target is to obtain a polymer capped at both end by sulphobenzoate groups, "primarily", in the present context most of said copolymers herein will be endcapped by sulphobenzoate groups. However, some copolymers will be less than fully capped, and therefore their end groups may consist of monoester of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol, thereof consist "secondarily" of such speC1es.<br>
The selected polyesters herein contain about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephthalic acid, about 16% by weight of 1,2-propanediol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol, about 13% by weight of dimethyl sulfobenzoic acid and about 15% by weight of sulfoisophthalic acid, and have a molecular weight of about 3.000. The polyesters and their method of preparation are described in detail in EP 311 342.<br>
Softening agents: Fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. These agents may be inorganic or organic in type. Inorganic softening agents are exemplified by the smectite clayg disclosed in GB-A-1 400898 and in US 5,019,292. Organic fabric softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines as disclosed in GB-Al 514 276 and EP 0 oil 340 and their combination with mono C12-C14 quaternary ammonium salts are disclosed in EP-B-0 026 528 and di-long-chain mides as disclosed in EP 0 242 919. Other useful organic<br><br>
ingredients of fabric softening systems include high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials as disclosed in EP 0 299<br>
575 and 0 313 146.<br>
Levels of smectite clay are normally in the range from 5% to 15%, more preferably from 8% to 12% by weight, with the material being added as a dry mixed component to the remainder of the formulation. Organic fabric softening agents such as the water-insoluble tertiary amines or dilong chain amide materials are incorporated at levels of from 0.5% to 5% by weight, normally from 1% to 3% by weight whilst the high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials and the water soluble cationic materials are added at levels of from 0.1% to 2%, normally from 0.15% to 1.5% by weight. These materials are normally added to the spray dried portion of the composition, although in some instances it may be more convenient to add them as a dry mixed particulate, or spray them as molten liquid on to other solid components of the composition.<br>
Polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents: The detergent compositions according to the present invention may also comprise from 0*001% to 10%, preferably from 0.01% to 2%, more preferably form 0.05% to 1% by weight of polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents. Said polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are normally incorporated into detergent compositions in order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability of complexing or adsorbing the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash.<br>
EspeC1ally suitable polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinyl-pyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, polyvinylpyrrolidone poilymers, polyvinyloxazolidones and polyvinylimidazoles or mixtures thereof.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance op  the enzymes according the invention.<br>
The detergent composition according to the invention can be in liquid, paste, gels, bars or granular forms.<br><br>
Non-dusting granulates may be produced, e.g., as disclosed in US 4,106,991 and 4,661,452 (both to Novo Industri A/S) and may optionally be coated by methods known in the art. Examples of waxy coating materials are poly(ethylene oxide) products (poiyethyleneglycol, PEG) with mean molecular weights of 1000 to 20000; ethoxylated nonylphenols having from 16 to 50 ethylene oxide units; ethoxylated fatty alcohols in which the alcohol contains from 12 to 20 carbon atoms and in which there are 15 ta  80 ethylene oxide units; fatty alcohols; fatty acids;<br>
and mono-- and di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Examples of film-forming coating materials suitable for application by fluid bed techniques are given in GB 1483591.<br>
Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. form 550 to 950 g/1; in such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "Inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "Compact" detergent typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt. The liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "concentrated form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Typically, the water content of the concentrated liquid detergent is less than 30%, more preferably less than 20%, most preferably less than 10% by weight of the detergent compositions.<br>
The compositions of the invention may for example, be formulated as hand and machine laundry detergent compositions including laundry additive compositions and compositions suitable for use in the pretreatment of stained fabrics, rinse added fabric softener compositions, and compositions for use in general household hard surface cleaning operations and dishwashing operations.<br><br><br><br>

General molecular biology methods:<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned the DNA manipulations and transformations were performed using standard methods of molecular biology (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for BaC1llus", John Wiley and Sons, 1990).<br>

Unless otherwise mentioned all enzymes for DNA manipulations,<br>
such las e.g. restiction endonucleases, ligases etc., are ob-<br>
tained from New England Biolabs, Inc.<br>
Proteolytic Activity<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU). The activity is determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASEO), and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a GlyC1ne Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15-minutes' incubation at 40 deg C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NH2-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glyC1ne.<br><br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate sucC1nyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitrophenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists SoC1ety, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A., (1988).<br>
Fermentation:<br>
Fermentation of subtilase enzymes were performed at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days.<br>
Consequently in order to make an e.g. 2 liter broth 20 Erlenmeyer flasks were fermented simultaneously.<br>
Media:<br>
BPX: Composition (per liter)<br>
Potato starch	100g<br>
Ground barley	50g<br>
Soybean flour	20g<br>
Na2HPO4 X 12 H2O	9g<br>
Pluronic	0.1g<br>
Sodium caseinate	10g<br>

i the medium is sterilized by heating at 120°C for 45 minutes. After sterilization the pH of the medium is adjusted to 9 by addition 6f NaHCOa to 0.1 M.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Construction and Expression of Enzyme Variants;<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis: Subtilase 309 site-directed variants was made by the "Unique site elimination (USE)" or the "UraCil-USE" technique described respectively by Deng et al. (Anal. Biochem. 200:81-88 (1992)) and Markvardsen et al. (BioTechniques 18(3):371-372 (1995)).<br><br>
The template plasmid was pJS3, or a analogue of this containing a variant of Subtilase 309, e.g. USE mutagenesis was performed on pJS3 analogue containing a gene encoding the Y167A variant with a oligonucleotide directed to the construct R170L variant resulting in a final yi67A+R170L Subtilase 309 variant.<br>
The in pJS3 constructed Subtilase 309 variants was then subcloned into the B.subtilis pSX222 expression plasmid, using the restriction enzymes Kpnl and Mlul.<br>
LocmlizBd Random mutagenesis:<br>
The overall strategy to used to perform localized random mutagenesis was:<br>
a mutagenic primer (oligonucleotide) was synthesized which corresponds to the part of the DNA sequence to be mutagenized except for the nucleotide(s) corresponding to amino acid codon(s) to be mutagenized.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer. The resulting PCR fragment was purified and digested and cloned into a E.coli~B.subtil is  shuttle vector.<br>
Alternatively and if necessary, the resulting PCR fragment is used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer so as to allow digestion and cloning of the mutagenized region into the shuttle vector. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br>
Following this strategy a localized random library was constructed in SAVINASE wherein both position Y167 and R170 was completely randomized.<br>
One oligonucleotide was synthesized with 25% of each of the four bases (W) in the first and the second base at amino acid codons wanted to be mutagenized. The third nucleotide (the wobble base) in codons were synthesized with 50%G/50%C (S) to avoid two (TAA, TGA) of the three stop-codons .<br>
The mutagenic primer (5'- GTT TGG ATC AGT AGC TCC GAC TGC CAT TGC GTT CGC ATA SNU CGC CGG SNN GCT GAT TGA GCC -3' (anti-sense)) were used In a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer (e.g. 5' GAA CTC GAT CCA GCG ATT TC 3' (sense)) and the plasmid pJS3 as template. This resulting PCR product was cloned<br><br>
into the pJS3 shuttle vector by using the restriction enzymes<br>
Asp 718 and Bel I.<br>
The in pJS3 constructed localized random library was then subclored into the B.subtilis pSX222 expression plasmid, using the restriction enzymes KphI and Mlul,<br>
The library prepared contained approximately 100,000 individual clones/library.<br>
Ten randomly chosen colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations Resigned.<br>
In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention the B. subtilis •'pSX222 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention was transformed into a competent B. subtilis strain and was fermented as described above in a medium<br>
containing 10 |ig/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM) . EXAMPLE 2<br>
Purification of Enzyme Variants;<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 litre scale fermentation of the Subtilisin 147 enzyme, the Subtilisin 309 enzyme or mutants thereof.<br>
Approximately 1.6 litres of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 litre beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SIYIO UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at rpom temperature on a BaC1traC1n affinity column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the BaC1traC1n column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethyl-glutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calC1um chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the BaC1traC1n purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer<br><br>
containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calC1um chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calC1um chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium ,^^loride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.)*<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for the construction and the above isolation procedure the following subtilisin 309 variants were produced and isolated:<br>

The following examples provide results from a number of washing tests that  were conducted under the conditions indicated<br><br>
Experimental conditions<br>
Table IV: Experimental conditions for evaluation of Subtilisin 309 variants.<br><br>
Subsequent to washing the cloths were flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br>
The above model detergent is a simple detergent formulation. The most characteristic features are that STP is used as builder and the content of anionic tenside (LAS) is quite high. Further the pH is adjusted to 10.4, which is within the normal range of a powder detergent.<br><br><br>
Water hardness is adjusted by adding CaCl2 and MgCl2 to deionized water. pH of the detergent solution is modified to the desired value by addition of acid.<br>
Measurement of remission (i?) on the test material has been done at 460 nm using an Elrepho 2000 photometer (without UV). Aperture: 10 mM.<br>
The wash performance at XnM is calculated as:<br><br>
Rx: is the wash effect of the enzyme at X nM (in remission units).<br>
R90: is the wash effect of the enzyme at 0 nM (blank value)<br><br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Wash Performance of Detergent Compositions Comprising Enzyme Variants<br>
The following examples provide results from a number of wash ing<br>
tests that were conducted under the conditions indicated<br>
EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS<br><br>
Table VII: Experimental conditions for evaluation of Subtilisin 309 variants.<br><br>
The detergent used is a simple model formulation. pH is adjusted to 10,5 which is within the normal range for a powder detergent: The composition of model detergent 95 is as follows:<br>
25%   STP (NaaPaO10) 25% Na2SO4<br>
10%  Na2SO4 20%   LAS (Nansa SOS)<br>
5.0%	Nonionic tenside (Dobanol 25-7)<br>
5.0% Na2SO4<br>
0.5%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
9.5%	Water<br>
Water hardness was adjusted by adding CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Ca2 +:Mg2+ = 2:1) to deionized water (see also Surfactants in Consumer<br><br>
Products - Theory, Technology and Application, springer 1986). pH of the detergent solution was adjusted to pH 10.5 by addition of HCl.<br>
Measurement of reflectance (R) on the test material was done at 460 ,nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 7000 photometer (Macbeth, Division of Kollmorgen Instruments Corporation, Germany). The measurements were done according to the manufacturers protocol.<br>
The wash performance of the Subtilisin 309 variants was evaluated by calculating a performance factor:<br><br>
P:	Performance factor<br>
Rvariant:	Reflectance of test	material washed with variant<br>
Rsavinase'-	Reflectance of test	material washed with Savinase®<br>
Reiank:	Reflectance of test	material washed with no enzyme<br>
The claimed Subtilisin 309 variants all have improved wash performance compared to Savinase® - i.e. P &gt; 1.<br>
The variants are divided into improvement classes designated with capital letters:<br>
Class A: 1 
Class B: 1.5  2<br>
 Table VIII: Subtilisin 309 variants and improvement classes.<br><br><br><br><br>
The Savinase® variant Y167I+R170L+A194P was in a fermentation<br>
experiment compared to a variant Y167I+R170L not having the A194P substitution.<br>
Both variants were cloned in a pSX222 expression vector background and fermented as described above in a 100 ml BPX<br>
medium containing 10 μg/ml CAM.<br>
After 5 days fermentation 1.5 ml of the BPX fermentation medium was centrifuged and the supernatant was used to measure the ProtdiSlytic activity (KPNU) as described above.<br>
The fermentation medium containing the Y167I+R170L+A194P variant had a significant higher level of proteolytic activity as compared to the fermentation medium containing the Y167I+R170L variant.<br>
Both variants have the same speC1fic activity. Similar  results  were  obtained  with  the  variants Y167A+;R170S+A194P,  Y167A+R170L+A194P,  and  Y167A+R170N+A194P compared with their corresponding variant without the A194P mutation.<br>
Further, similar results were obtained with the variants A133P+Y167A+R170S, A133D+Y167A+R170S, P129K+Y167A+R170S, and P131H+Y167A+R170S compared with their corresponding variants without the A133P, A133D, P129K, and P131H mutations.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
