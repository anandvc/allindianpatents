				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, use of said compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of Inter  alia   shock conditions as well as to a method for treatment of said conditions, wherein said compounds are administered. Background<br>
Peptidic vasopressin VIa receptor agonists, such as terlipressin, have recently (see e.g.   O'Brian et al.. Lancet 359 (9313):1209-10, June 4th, 2002) received increased attention for clinical use in treatment of critical care diseases and conditions, including shock of hypovolemic (e.g. hemorrhagic) or vasodilatory {.e.g.   septic) origin, bleeding esophageal varices (BEV), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), cardiopulmonary resuscitation and anesthesia-induced hypotension. They have also been shown to have clinical use in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, intra-operative blood loss and blood loss associated with burn debridement and epistaxis, and for treatment of various ocular diseases by increasing lacrimation/tear formation.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide efficacious compounds, especially at the human V1a (hVla) receptor, that may provide alternatives,e.g., to terlipressin in the treatment of critical care conditions.<br>

Experimental (synthesis)<br>
Amino acid derivatives and resins were purchased from commercial providers (Novabiochem, Bachem, Peptide International and PepTech Corporation). Other chemicals and solvents were provided from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific and VWR.<br>
The compounds herein were synthesised by standard methods in solid phase peptide chemistry utilising both Fmoc and Boc methodology. Unless otherwise provided, all reactions were performed at room temperature. In addition<br>
 <br>
to the references cited supra,   the following standard reference literature provides further guidance on general experimental set up, as well as on the availability of required starting material and reagents:<br>
Kates, S.A., Albericio, F., Eds., Solid Phase Synthesis.   A Practical  Guide,   Marcel Dekker, New York, Basel, 2000;<br>
Stewart, J.M., Young, J.D. Solid Phase  Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Company, 1984;<br>
Bisello, et al.,   J.   Biol.   Chem.   1998, 273, 22498-22505; and<br>
• Merrifield, J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc.   1963, 85, 2149-2154.<br>
Purity of the synthesized peptide may be determined by analytical reversed phase HPLC. Structural integrity of the peptides may be confirmed using amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry.<br>
The peptides synthesised by Fmoc methodology were cleaved with a TFA/TIS/H20 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution, and cleavage in Boc methodology was accomplished with 90% HF/10% anisole (v/v) solution. Disulfide bridge (ring) formation was achieved by oxidation of linear peptides dissolved in 10% TFA (aq) with iodine. Peptides were purified by preparative HPLC in triethylammonium phosphate buffers (aq). The compounds were finally converted to acetate salts using conventional HPLC methodology. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled and lyophilised.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with alkylated side chain in position no. 8 (e.g. compound 4):<br>
The peptides were assembled with Fmoc methodology. The diamino acid residue in position no. 8 was introduced with an acid labile (i.e. removable with a solution containing 1-2% TFA) protecting group, such as methoxy-trityl (Mmt; see Barlos, K. et al.   in Peptides  1992, Schneider, C.H., Eberle, A.N., Eds., ESCOM Science Publishers B.V., 1993, pp 283-284). Resin bound peptide<br>
was treated with a DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution for the Mmt group removal. Reductive alkylation with acetone/NaBH(OAc)3 provided the N-isopropyl peptide.<br>
To avoid undesirable N, N-dialkylation in reductive alkylation in the above procedure, which may occur when straight chain alkyl aldehydes are used, an alternative was developed, wherein after the Mmt removal the amino group was first derivatised with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (o-NBS-Cl; see Fukuyama, T.; Jow, C.-K.; Cheung, M. Tetrahedron Lett.   1995, 36, 6373-6374). The resulting sulphonamide was then alkylated with an appropriate alcohol under conventional Mitsunobu reaction conditions, typically utilising TPP/DIAD in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Mitsunobu, O. Synthesis  1981, 1-28). The o-NBS-Cl group was subsequently removed with 5% potassium thiophenolate in DMF, after which the peptide was cleaved from the resin.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with N-alkylated side chain in position no. 4:<br>
The peptides were assembled with Boc methodology. The residue in position no. 4 was introduced in the sequence as Boc-Asp(OFm)-OH. After complete peptide assembly the side chain protection was removed with 30% piperidine in DMF. The resulting free carboxylic group was converted to the desired amide by coupling with an appropriate amine mediated by PyBOP or BOP/DIEA. The N-terminal Boc group was then removed, followed by HF cleavage, cyclisation and purification by HPLC.<br>
Table 1 lists the compounds prepared by the above procedure together with the determined (vide  infra)   EC50 (median effective concentration) expressed in nanomol/L. R3, R4, Rs, R6, R7 and Re are H for all compounds except compound 4, where R6 is isopropyl instead of H. For the listed compounds m is 1, except where R1 and R2 are part of an alicyclic structure (formed together with the a carbon of the amino acid in position no. 2) exemplified here as 1,1-cyclobutyl.<br>

The following, detailed examples are provided to further illustrate the synthesis:<br>
Compound 4; [Cha2,Asn4, Orn (i-Pr) 8] VT: The amino acid derivatives used were Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Cha-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Cys(Trt) -OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Orn(Mmt)-OH and Fmoc-Gly-OH. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters 600 Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18, 5µ 4.6 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Waters 2000 Liquid Chromatograph using a Prepak 47 x 300 mm cartridge at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. Final compound analysis was performed on a 1100 Agilent Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18, 5µ 2.1 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 0.3<br>
<br>
ml/min. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT spectrometer.<br>
The fully protected peptide resin was synthesised on an Applied Biosystems 9050 Peptide Synthesiser starting from 0.4 g (0.1 mmol) of Tentagel-S-RAM resin (Peptides International). DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with a 4-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were performed. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF. Upon completion of the automated synthesis, the resin was transferred into a manual synthesis vessel and was treated with DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution (30 ml) for 2 x 1.5 hours for removal of the Mmt group. The resin was thoroughly washed with DCM and was subsequently suspended in 15 ml of 1,2-dichloroetehane/TMOF 1:1 (v/v). 0.2 ml of acetone was then added followed by 0.6 g of NaBH(OAc)3. The suspension was shaken overnight and the resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in vacuo.   The resin was then treated with 30 ml of the TFA/TIS/H20 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution for 1.5 hours and filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated and the crude linear peptide was precipitated w.ith diethyl ether. The precipitate was immediately dissolved in 500 ml of 10% TFA (aq), and the peptide was oxidised by adding 0.1 M I2 in methanol to the magnetically stirred solution until yellow color persisted. Excess of iodine was reduced with ascorbic acid. The reaction mixture was then cooled with crushed ice and pH was adjusted to about 5 by adding concentrated ammonia (aq). The mixture was loaded onto an HPLC column and purified using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer with pH 5.2. The compound was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled, and the resulting solution was diluted with 2 volumes of water. The solution was reloaded onto the column which was then washed with 2 1 of 0.1 M ammonium acetate (aq) and equilibrated with 2% acetic acid (aq). The compound was<br>
<br>
eluted with a fast (3%/min) gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilised. 20.7 mg (20% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained. HPLC: Rt=8.2 min, gradient: 30-»50% B over 20 min, flow: 0.3 ml/min, t=40°C, solvent A 0.01% TFA (aq), solvent B 70% CH3CN, 0.01% TFA (aq); Purity: 100%; MS (M+H+) : expected 1026.5, observed 1026.5.<br>
Compound 3; [AcBuc2, Dbu8] VT :<br>
The amino acid derivatives used were Boc-Cys(Mob)-OH, Boc-AcBuc-OH, Boc-Ile-OH, Boc-Gln-OH, Boc-Asn-OH, Boc-Pro-OH, Boc-Dbu(Z)-OH DOHA salt and Boc-Gly-OH, all purchased from Novabiochem and Bachem. HPLC and MS operations were performed as in the synthesis of compound 4.<br>
The fully protected peptide resin was manually synthesised starting from 0.6 g (0.4 mmol) of 4-methyl-benzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem). DCC, PyBOP or DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with 2.5-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were employed. The Boc group was removed with 50% TFA in DCM containing 1% of m-cresol. The finished resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in   vacuo.   The peptide was cleaved from the resin by using 30 ml of anhydrous HF containing 3 ml of anisole at 0°C for 90 minutes. The HF was evaporated off, and the crude linear peptide was washed with diethyl ether. The peptide was immediately dissolved in 200 ml of 25% acetonitrile/10% TFA (aq) and oxidised as described supra.   The resulting mixture was loaded directly onto an HPLC column and purified using triethylammonium phosphate buffer at pH 2.3. Unless otherwise provided the subsequent steps were identical to the procedure for compound 4. 80.6 mg (22% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained. HPLC: Rt=7.3 min, gradient: 20-»40% B over 20 min, flow: 0.3 ml/min, t=40°C, solvent A 0.01% TFA (aq), solvent B 70% CH3CN, 0.01% TFA (aq); Purity: 99.6%; MS (M+H+) : expected 928.4, observed 928.3.<br>
<br>
The other compounds were prepared by analogous variation of these synthetic procedures.<br>
Experimental (biological testing)<br>
In  vitro  receptor assay:<br>
Agonist activity of compounds on the hVla receptor was determined in a transcriptional reporter assay by transiently transfecting a hVla receptor expression DNA into HEK-293 cells in concert with a reporter DNA containing intracellular calcium responsive promoter elements regulating expression of firefly luciferase. See Boss, V.f Talpade, D.J., Murphy, T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996, May 3; 271(18), 10429-10432 for further guidance on this assay. Cells were exposed to serial dilutions of compounds diluted 10-fold per dose for 5 hours, followed by lysis of cells, determination of luciferace activity, and determination of compound efficacies and EC50 values through non-linear regression. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) was used as an internal control in each experiment (EC50 = 0.21 nM), and compounds were tested in at least three independent experiments.<br>
The results of the in  vitro  assays are depicted in table 1 supra,   including results for terlipressin. The EC50 value given is the geometric mean expressed in nanomol/L (nM).<br>
