				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to a glass run channel of<br>
automotive door window, that is mounted to an inner periphery of a<br>
door window frame for enabling a movable glass pane to slide therein,<br>
and more particularly to improvement in the glass run channel.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Hitherto, various glass run channels have been proposed and put<br>
into practical use particularly in the field of automotive door windows,<br>
and various attempts have been made for obtaining a smooth and<br>
noiseless running of the movable glass pane in the glass run channel.<br>
One of such glass run channels hitherto proposed is disclosed in<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application (Tokkai) 2000-280755.<br>
In order to clarify the present invention, the glass run channel<br>
disclosed by this laid-open Patent Application will be briefly discussed in<br>
the following with reference to Figs. 4 and 5 of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
As is seen from Fig. 4, the glass run channel 1 shown in the<br>
drawing is designed for a front left door 2 of a motor vehicle. That is,<br>
the glass run channel 1 is constructed to be mounted to an inner<br>
periphery of a door window frame 2a of the front left door 2.<br>
As is seen from Fig. 5, the glass run channel 1 is constructed of a<br>
rubber material and comprises generally a longitudinally extending main<br>
body portion 3 that is snugly received in a channel portion defined by<br>
the door window frame 2a and has a generally U-shaped cross section,<br>
longitudinally extending inside and outside wall portions 4 and 5 that<br>
are integral with inside and outside leading parts of the main body<br>
portion 3, and longitudinally extending first and second seal lips 8 and 9<br>
that extend from leading ends of the inside and outside wall portions 4<br>
and 5 toward a bottom part 6 of the main body portion 3, as shown.<br>
The first and second seal lips 8 and 9 are arranged to closely and<br>
2<br><br>
resiliency put therebetween a glass pane 7 in a manner to achieve a<br>
hermetical sealing therebetween.<br>
As is shown, the first seal lip 8 is formed at its root portion with a<br>
notch (more specially, a groove extending along the entire construction<br>
of the glass run channel 1) 8a by which the first seal lip 8 is easily<br>
flexed toward the inside of the vehicle upon receiving a certain external<br>
force. Furthermore, the first seal lip 8 is formed at its leading end with<br>
a projection (more specifically, a ridge extending along the entire<br>
construction of the glass run channel 1) 8b that projects toward the<br>
inside of the vehicle.<br>
The inside wall portion 4 is integrally formed with a longitudinally<br>
extending sub-lip 10 that extends generally in parallel with the first seal<br>
lip 8, as shown.<br>
In operation, the glass pane 7 is moved upward or downward<br>
keeping lateral ends 7a thereof put and guided by the first and second<br>
seal lips 8 and 9.<br>
Once the glass pane 7 is moved up to its fully closed uppermost<br>
position as may be understood from Fig. 4, the first and second seal lips<br>
8 and 9 function to tightly hold the glass pane 7 in position. When,<br>
under this condition, an external force is applied to the glass pane 7 to<br>
bias the same in a direction toward the inside of the vehicle, the first<br>
seal lip 8 is flexed in the same direction.   Upon this, the projection 8b<br>
of the lip 8 is brought into contact with the sub-lip 10, and thus the<br>
inward inclination of the glass pane 7 is supported by both the lips 8<br>
and 10. Thus, an exceeding inward inclination of the glass pane 7 is<br>
suppressed. Thus, in the glass run channel 1 proposed by the above-<br>
mentioned Japanese Laid-open Patent Application, the closing/opening<br>
movement of the glass pane 7 is smoothly and reliably carried out even<br>
if the door window frame 2a, the glass run channel 1 and the glass<br>
pane 7 fail to have a precise assembly.<br>
3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, due to its inherent construction, the glass run channel 1<br>
of the above-mentioned Laid-open Application fails to provide<br>
passengers of the vehicle with a satisfaction for the following reasons.<br>
That is, usually, irrespective of whether the glass pane 7 is being<br>
moved or stopped, the projection 8b of the first seal lip 8 and the sub-<br>
lip 10 are kept separated from each other.  However, when for example<br>
the vehicle is running on a rough road, the glass pane 7 kept dosed is<br>
forced to incline inward and outward repeatedly. This repeated inward<br>
and outward inclination induces touching and detaching between the<br>
projection 8b and the sub-lip 10 producing contact noises, which make<br>
the passengers feel uncomfortable. It has been revealed that such<br>
noises become much remarkable when the glass pane 7 takes a slightly<br>
open position.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
glass run channel which is free of the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a glass run<br>
channel wherein a member that corresponds to the above-mentioned<br>
projection 8b and another member that corresponds to the above-<br>
mentioned sub-lip 10 constantly contact to each other.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a glass run channel installed in a window frame for guiding a<br>
glass pane, which comprises a base structure of an elastic material,<br>
including a bottom portion and first and second side wall portions that<br>
extend in the same direction from respective ends of the bottom portion<br>
in a manner to define therebetween a given space whose bottom is<br>
defined by the bottom portion, the given space receiving therein an<br>
edge part of the glass pane; first and second seal lips integral with the<br>
base structure and respectively extending from the first and second side<br>
wall portions toward the given space in a manner to resiliently put<br>
therebetween the edge part of the glass pane at their mutually facing<br>
main portions; and a supporting lip integral with the base structure and<br>
extending from the first side wall toward the first seal lip, wherein a<br>
4<br><br>
given part of the supporting lip constantly contacts with the first seal lip<br>
to press the first seal lip against the edge part of the glass pane as long<br>
as the glass pane is set between the first and second seal lips and<br>
placed near the given part of the supporting lip.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a glass run channel assembly which comprises a<br>
window frame having a generally U-shaped cross section including a<br>
base panel and first and second side panels that extend in the same<br>
direction from opposed ends of the base panel thereby to define<br>
therebetween a first given space; a glass run channel of an elastic<br>
material held in and by the window frame, the glass run channel<br>
including a bottom portion that is received in the first given space near<br>
the base panel of the window frame, first and second side wall portions<br>
that extend in the same direction from respective ends of the bottom<br>
portion in a manner to define therebetween a second given space, first<br>
and second seal lips that are respectively integral with the first and<br>
second side wall portions and extend from the same toward the second<br>
given space in a manner to resiliency put therebetween an edge part of<br>
a glass pane at their mutually facing mina portion; and a supporting lip<br>
that is integral with the first side wall portion and extends from the<br>
same toward the first seal lip, wherein a given part of the supporting lip<br>
constantly contacts with the first seal lip to press the same against the<br>
edge part of the glass pane as long as the glass pane is set between the<br>
first and second seal lips and placed near the given part of the<br>
supporting lip.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, a glass run channel of the present invention will<br>
be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
For ease of understanding, various directional terms, such as,<br>
right, left, upper, lower, rightward and the like are used in the<br>
description.  However, such terms are to be understood with respect to<br>
only a drawing or drawings on which a corresponding part or portion is<br>
shown.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, there is shown a front left door 2 of a motor<br>
vehicle, to which a glass run channel 21 of the present invention is<br>
practically applied. The front left door 2 is equipped with a door window<br>
frame 20 in which a glass pane 26 runs upward and downward through<br>
the glass run channel 21.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, particularly Fig. 1, there is shown but<br>
in a sectional manner the glass run channel 21 of the present invention<br>
in a condition wherein the glass run channel 21 is properly installed in<br>
the door window frame 20.<br>
In the illustrated example, the door window frame 20 comprises<br>
generally a longitudinally extending inner panel 20a, a longitudinally<br>
extending outer panel 20b and a longitudinally extending reinforcing<br>
panel 20c. As is seen from the drawing, the inner and outer panels 20a<br>
6<br><br>
and 20b are integral parts that extend leftward from a common base<br>
portion "B". While the reinforcing panel 20c is secured at its right edge<br>
to the common base portion "B" via welding or the like.<br>
The reinforcing panel 20c is arranged between the inner and outer<br>
panels 20a and 20b and has an inward shifted leading part secured to<br>
the inner panel 20a via welding or the like. As shown, the three panels<br>
20a, 20b and 20c of the door window frame 20 are assembled together<br>
to constitute a longitudinally extending channel construction "LECC" for<br>
mounting therealong the glass run channel 21 of the invention.<br>
As is best seen from Fig. 1, the glass run channel 21 is<br>
constructed of an elastic material, such as rubber or the like through<br>
extrusion molding and comprises a bottom portion 22 that is put on a<br>
flat base part of the reinforcing panel 20c, inside and outside wall<br>
portions 23 and 24 that extend leftward in the drawing from both ends<br>
of the bottom portion 22, respective bent back portions 25a and 25b<br>
that extend back rightward from the leftward leading ends of the inside<br>
and outside wall portions 23 and 24 while receiving or holding therein a<br>
combined part of the inside panel 20a and the reinforcing panel 20c and<br>
the outside panel 20b respectively, a first seal lip 27 that extends back<br>
rightward and inwardly from the leftward leading end of the inside wall<br>
portion 23 toward the bottom wall 22, a second seal lip 28 that extends<br>
back rightward and inwardly from the leftward leading end of the<br>
outside wall portion 24 toward the bottom wall 22, and a supporting lip<br>
29 that extends rightward inwardly from a middle portion of the inside<br>
wall portion 23 toward the bottom portion 22.<br>
As is seen from Fig. 2, when, due to taking a lower open position<br>
by the glass pane 26, no external force is applied, vertically upper parts<br>
of the first and second seal lips 27 and 28 are biased to contact to each<br>
other at their leading end portions 27a and 28a, and the supporting lip<br>
29 is kept separated from the first seal lip 27.<br>
While, as is seen from Fig. 1, when the glass pane 26 comes up to<br>
an upper open illustrated position, the first and second seal lips 27 and<br>
28 become separated by the glass pane 26 while being pressed against<br>
opposed surfaces of the glass pane 26.<br>
7<br><br>
Referring back to Fig. 2, the bottom portion 22 is formed with<br>
holding lips 30 and 31 that are pressed against the reinforcing panel<br>
20c.<br>
As shown, when the glass run channel 21 is properly set on the<br>
longitudinally extending channel construction "LECC" of the door<br>
window frame 20, a certain clearance of a given distance "L" is defined<br>
between mutually facing surfaces of the inside and outside wall portions<br>
23 and 24. The distance "L" is so determined as to permit a certain<br>
inward and outward inclination of the glass pane 26 (see Fig. 1) in the<br>
glass run channel 21.<br>
As shown in the drawing (Fig. 2), under the non-stressed<br>
condition, the leading end 27a of the first seal lip 27 is in contact with<br>
the leading end 28a of the second seal lip 28 while projecting slightly<br>
beyond the leading end 28a toward the bottom portion 22.<br>
The first seal lip 27 has a concave outer surface 27b that faces<br>
the supporting lip 29, and has at its root portion a notch 27c (more<br>
specifically, a groove extending along the entire construction of the<br>
glass run channel 21) for adjusting a counterforce against which flexing<br>
of the first seal lip 27 toward the supporting lip 29 is carried out.<br>
The second seal lip 28 has a concave outer surface that faces the<br>
outside wall portion 24, and has at its root portion a notch (more<br>
specifically, a groove extending along the entire construction of the<br>
glass run channel 21) 28b for adjusting a counterforce against which<br>
flexing of the second seal lip 28 toward the outside wall portion 24 is<br>
carried out.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the supporting lip 29 has a thinner leading<br>
portion 34 that is slightly inclined toward the inside wall portion 23.<br>
More specifically, the supporting lip 29 comprises a thicker base portion<br>
32 that is integral with the inside wall portion 23 and the thinner<br>
leading portion 34 is integrally connected to the thicker base portion 32<br>
through an elbow part 33. The thicker base portion 32 that extends<br>
from its base part 32a to the elbow part 33 is inclined at a given small<br>
angle toward the bottom wall 22, as shown.  Furthermore, the thicker<br>
8<br><br>
base portion 32 has a substantially trapezoidal cross section whose<br>
thickness gradually reduces with increase of a distance from the base<br>
part 32a.<br>
As shown, the thinner leading portion 34 of the supporting lip 29<br>
has a generally even thickness therethroughout and has a round top<br>
portion 34a.<br>
It is to be noted that when, due to the glass pane 26 assuming a<br>
lower position relative to the door window frame 20, substantially no<br>
stress is applied to the portion of the glass run channel 21 that is shown<br>
in Fig. 2, the round top portion 34a of the thinner leading portion 34 is<br>
kept away from the concave outer surface 27b of the first seal lip 27<br>
keeping a certain distance therebetween.<br>
However, as is seen from Fig. 1, once the glass pane 26 is raised<br>
up to the position that is shown in this drawing, the first seal lip 27 is<br>
flexed by the glass pane 26 toward the supporting lip 29 causing the<br>
concave outer surface 27b thereof to constantly contact with the round<br>
top portion 34a of the supporting lip 29 with a certain biasing force.  It<br>
is to be noted that under this condition, the concave outer surface 26b<br>
and the round top portion 34a are kept in contact with each other.<br>
For ease of description of operation, movement of the glass pane<br>
26 in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a vertical<br>
direction along which the glass pane 26 moves upward or downward for<br>
closing or opening the door window will be referred to "shifting" in the<br>
following.<br>
As is understood from Fig. 1, when the glass pane 26 is moved up<br>
from its lowermost open position to its uppermost full close position, the<br>
glass pane 26 is forced to shift inward, due to an inwardly curved<br>
structure of the channel construction "LECC" of the door window frame<br>
20 by a given degree "X" that is about the thickness of the first seal lip<br>
27. That is, in the illustrated embodiment, once the glass pane 26<br>
comes up to the uppermost full close position, the same is forced to<br>
shift to its innermost position pressing the first seal lip 27 to fully or<br>
9<br><br>
deeply contact with the thinner leading portion 34 of the supporting lip<br>
29, as is indicated by phantom line in Fig. 1.<br>
In the following, the movement of the glass pane 26 in the glass<br>
run channel 21 will be described with the aid of Figs. 1 and 2 for the<br>
purpose of understanding a unique operation of the glass run channel<br>
21, particularly, a unique action of the first seal lip 27 and that of the<br>
supporting lip 29 of the glass run channel 21.<br>
As may be seen from Fig. 1, when the glass pane 26 is in a<br>
slightly open position as is indicated by a solid line, the concave outer<br>
surface 27b of the first seal lip 27 is in contact with the round top<br>
portion 34a of the supporting lip 29. Under this condition, the mutual<br>
contact between the two portions 27b and 34a is assuredly made due to<br>
a force produced when the thinner leading portion 34 of the supporting<br>
lip 29 is bent by the first seal lip 27. Thus, under this condition, the two<br>
portions 27b and 34a have little chance to be separated, that is, little<br>
chance to make noise by them.   It is to be noted that under this<br>
condition, movement of the glass pane 26 toward the uppermost close<br>
position is easily carried out because the counterforce possessed by the<br>
thinner leading portion 34 is not so large.<br>
When the glass pane 26 is moved up to its uppermost full close<br>
position, the glass pane 26 is shifted inward to the position as indicated<br>
by the phantom line for the reason as is mentioned hereinabove. In<br>
such full close position of the glass pane 26, the concave outer surface<br>
27b of the first seal lip 27 deeply contacts with the thinner leading<br>
portion 34 of the supporting lip 29 as indicated by the phantom line.<br>
Under this condition, the two portions 27b and 34 are tightly pressed<br>
against each other because of the increased counterforce produced<br>
when the thinner leading portion 34 is largely bent by the first seal lip<br>
27. Thus, under this condition, the two portions 27b and 34 have<br>
substantially no chance to be separated, that is, substantially no chance<br>
to make noise by them. Thus, even when the vehicle runs at a high<br>
speed on a rough road with the door window kept closed, possibility of<br>
producing any noise by the glass run channel 21 is suppressed or at<br>
least minimized.  Furthermore, even if the door is strongly closed with<br>
10<br><br>
the door window kept closed, such uncomfortable noise is not produced<br>
from the glass run channel 21 for the above-mentioned reasons.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a graph that depicts a<br>
relationship between a shift position (SP) of the glass pane 26 in the<br>
glass run channel 21 and a combined counterforce (P) of the first seal<br>
lip 27 and the supporting lip 29.  For comparison with the present<br>
invention, a reference example "Z" is also shown that is a case wherein<br>
only the first seal lip 27 is employed. That is, there is no lip that<br>
corresponds to the supporting lip 29.<br>
It is to be noted that the shift position (SP) of the glass pane 26<br>
indicates a lateral moved distance of the glass pane 26 from its<br>
normally set position (which is provided when the glass pane 26 is in its<br>
lowermost full open position) and the combined counterforce (P) is a<br>
total force of the first seal and supporting lips 27 and 29 that is applied<br>
to the inner surface of the glass pane 26 (see Fig. 1).<br>
As is seen from the graph of Fig. 3, when the glass pane 26 is<br>
within the above-mentioned given shift range UX", the combined<br>
counterforce (P) gradually increases as the glass pane 26 is shifted<br>
inward, that is, toward the inside of the vehicle. This means that within<br>
the given range WX", a smoothed and comfortable upward and<br>
downward movement of the glass pane 26 is carried out. Actually,<br>
under such condition, the combined counterforce (P) is kept relatively<br>
small.<br>
As is seen from the graph, when, due to, for example, a strong<br>
close action of the door, the glass pane 26 is forced to exceed the given<br>
range "X", the combined counterforce (P) is shapely increased at the<br>
point "Y" and thereafter shows a high gradient characteristic as<br>
indicated by "P1". This is because under such condition, the first seal<br>
lip 27 (see Fig. 1) becomes in contact with the elbow part 33 of the<br>
supporting lip 29 and thus applied with a stronger counterforce by the<br>
thicker base portion 32. Thus, undesired excessive shifting of the glass<br>
pane 26 in the glass run channel 21 is suppressed.<br>
11<br><br>
In the following, advantages of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
As is understood hereinabove, in the glass run channel 21 of the<br>
present invention, the first seal lip 27 and the supporting lip 29 are<br>
forced to contact with each other so long as the glass pane 26 takes<br>
their near position. Thus, undesired noise, that would be produced by<br>
the repeated separation/contact motions of the two lips 27 and 29<br>
under cruising of the vehicle, is suppressed or at least minimized.<br>
As is seen from Fig. 1, when the glass pane 26 is set in the glass<br>
run channel 21, the round top portion 34a of the supporting lip 29 is in<br>
contact with the concave outer surface 27b of the first seat lip 27. This<br>
means that the inward or outward shifting of the glass pane 26 due to<br>
upward or downward movement of the same induces a smoothed<br>
movement or slipping of the round top portion 34a on and along the<br>
concave outer surface 27b, and thus the upward or downward<br>
movement of the glass pane 26 for closing or opening the door window<br>
is smoothly carried out.<br>
Actually, when the glass pane 26 is gradually shifted inward when<br>
the same is moved upward, the generated force received by the thinner<br>
leading portion 34 from the concave outer surface 27b of the first seal<br>
lip 27 is gradually transmitted to the thicker base portion 32 of the<br>
supporting lip 29 while gradually flexing the thinner leading portion 34<br>
inward. Accordingly, the supporting force of the thinner leading portion<br>
34 has no effect on a smooth upward and downward movement of the<br>
glass pane 26, which can reduce the shifting of the glass pane 26 in the<br>
glass run channel 21.<br>
As is seen from the graph of Fig. 3, when the glass pane 26 is<br>
within the given shift range "X", the combined counterforce produced by<br>
the two lips 27 and 29 gradually Increases as the glass pane 26 is<br>
shifted inward, and thus, smoothed upward and downward movement<br>
of the glass pane 26 along the glass run channel 21 is carried out.<br>
Furthermore, against a big shock such as one produced when the<br>
door is strongly closed, the elbow part 33 of the supporting lip 29<br>
12<br><br>
serves as a stopper for stopping an excessive inward shifting of the<br>
glass pane 26.<br>
Furthermore, since the thicker base portion 32 has the trapezoidal<br>
cross section as shown in Fig. 1, the same can exhibit an ideal shock<br>
absorbing performance against a shock applied to the elbow part 33 of<br>
the supporting lip 29 by the glass pane 26.<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A glass run channel installed in a window frame for guiding a<br>
glass pane, comprising:<br>
a base structure of an elastic material, including a bottom portion<br>
and first and second side wall portions that extend in the same direction<br>
from respective ends of the bottom portion in a manner to define<br>
therebetween a given space whose bottom is defined by the bottom<br>
portion, the given space receiving therein an edge part of the glass<br>
pane;<br>
first and second seal lips integral with the base structure and<br>
respectively extending from the first and second side wall portions<br>
toward the given space in a manner to resiliently put therebetween the<br>
edge part of the glass pane at their mutually facing main portions; and<br>
a supporting lip integral with the base structure and extending<br>
from the first side wall toward the first seal lip,<br>
wherein a given part of the supporting lip constantly contacts with<br>
the first seal lip to press the first seal lip against the edge part of the<br>
glass pane as long as the glass pane is set between the first and second<br>
seal lips and placed near the given part of the supporting lip.<br>
2.	A glass run channel as claimed in Claim 1, in which the first seal<br>
lip is formed with a concave outer surface that faces toward the first<br>
side wall portion and slidably contacts with a leading portion of the<br>
supporting lip.<br>
3.	A glass run channel as claimed in Claim 2, in which the leading<br>
portion of the supporting Up is formed with a round top portion that<br>
slidably contacts with the concave outer surface of the first seal lip.<br>
4.	A glass run channel as claimed in Claim 2, in which the supporting<br>
lip comprises:<br>
a thicker base part integral with the first side wall portion;<br>
a thinner leading portion that extends from the thicker base part<br>
toward the first seal lip, the thinner leading portion having a round top<br><br>
portion slidably contacting with the concave outer surface of the first<br>
seal lip ; and<br>
an elbow part provided between the thicker base part and the<br>
thinner leading portion.<br>
