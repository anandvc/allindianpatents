				<td>A METHOD FOR PRODUCING A TRANSGENIC COTTON PLANT<br>
High Efficiency Agrebacterium-mediated<br>
Transformation of cotton<br>
Using Petiole Explants<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the general field<br>
of genetic engineering of plants, in particular to the<br>
introduction of exogenous genetic material into cotton<br>
by Agrobacterium transformation of cotton petiole<br>
explants followed by somatic embryo regeneration.<br>
packground <br>
Cotton is one of the most valuable and widely<br>
grown cash crops internationally. Its annual<br>
production worldwide is over 100 million bales valued<br>
at US$45 billion. Asia is the biggest cotton<br>
production area, with four out of five world top cotton<br>
producers located in this region. Cotton is not only<br>
the main supporter for the textile industry, but it<br>
also provides a huge and profitable market for<br>
manufacturers of chemicals for weed, disease and pest<br>
control. There are diverse opportunities for cotton<br>
molecular improvement, including improvement of yield<br>
and fiber quality and creation of new varieties that<br>
are resistant to herbicides, insects, nematodes and<br>
diseases (Steward, 1991).<br>
Tissue Culture of Cotton: In 1935, Skovsted<br>
reported the Hirst embryo culture of cotton. Beasley<br>
(1971) reported callus formation in cotton as an<br>
outgrowth from the micropylar end or fertilized ovules<br>
on Murashige &amp; Skoog (MS) medium. Somatic<br>
embryogenesis was achieved from a suspension culture of<br>
G. klotzschianum (Price &amp; Smith, 1979) . In 1983,<br>
Davidonis &amp; Hamilton first succeeded in efficient and<br>
repeatable regeneration of cotton {G. hirsutum L.)<br>
plants from callus after two-year cultivation. Cotton<br>
plants were since regenerated through somatic<br>
embryogenesis from different explants (Zhang &amp; Feng,<br>
1992; Zhang, 1994) including cotyledon (Davidonis et<br>
al., 1987; Davidonis &amp; Hamilton, 1983; Finer, 1988;<br>
Firoozabady et al., 1987), hypocotyl (Cousins et al.,<br>
1991; Rangan &amp; Zavala, 1984; Rangan &amp; Rajasekaran,<br>
1996; Trolinder &amp; Goodin, 1988; Umbeck et al., 1987,<br>
1989), stem (Altman et al., 1990; Bajaj et al., 1989;<br>
Chen, et al. 1987; Finer &amp; Smith, 1984), shoot apex<br>
(Bajaj et al., 1985; Gould et al., 1991; Turaev &amp;<br>
Shamina, 1986), immature embryo (Beasley, 1971; Stewart<br>
&amp; Hsu, 1977, 1978), petiole (Finer &amp; Smith, 1984; Gawel<br>
et al., 1986; Gawel &amp; Robacker, 1990), leaf (Finer &amp;<br>
Smith, 1984; Gawel &amp; Robacker, 1986), root (Chen &amp; Xia,<br>
1991; Kuo et al., 1989), callus (Finer &amp; McMullen,<br>
1990; Trolinder et al., 1991) ana protoplast (Chen et<br>
al., 1989).<br>
Transformation of cotton: Agrobacterium-mediated<br>
cotton transformation was first reported a decade ago<br>
with hypocotyl and cotyledon as explants (Firoozababy<br>
et al., 1987; Umbeck et al., 1987). Several useful<br>
genes have been introduced into cotton via<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, including insect<br>
and herbicide resistance genes (Perlak et al., 1990;<br>
Trolinder et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1994). Explants<br>
(such as hypocotyl, cotyledon, callus generated from<br>
hypocotyl and cotyledon/ as well as immature embryos)<br>
have bean used for Agrobacterium-mediated<br>
transformation and particle bombardment (de Fraxnond et<br>
al., 1983; Finer &amp; McMullen, 1990; Firoozabady et al.,<br>
1987/ Perlak et al., 1990; Rangan &amp; Rajasekaran, 1996;<br>
Rajasekaran et al., 1996; Trolinder et al., 1991;<br>
Umbeck et al., 1987, 1989, 1992). In addition,<br>
meristexnatic tissue of excised embryonic axes has also<br>
been used for cotton transformation by particle<br>
bombardment (Chlan et al., 1995; John, 1996; John &amp;<br>
Keller, 1996; McCabe &amp; Martinell, 1993). Zhou et al.<br>
(1983) transformed cotton by injecting DNA into the<br>
axile placenta one day after self-pollination.<br>
However, the transformation rates were generally<br>
low, ranging from 20 to 30% when hypocotyl were used as<br>
explant (Firoozababy et al., 1987; Cousins et al.,<br>
1991; Rajasekaran et al., 1996). A significantly<br>
higher transformation efficiency, up to 80%, was<br>
reported when cotyledon was used as explant and the ocs<br>
gene encoding octopine synthetase used as the reporter<br>
gene (Firoozababy et al., 1987). However, the validity<br>
of octopine as a marker for transformation is<br>
questionable because octopine has been found in several<br>
plant species certainly not transformed by infection<br>
with A. tumelaciens (Wendt-Gallitelli and Dobrigkeit,<br>
1973) . A more recent report indicated that the<br>
transformation efficiency of cotyledon was about 20 to<br>
30% (Cousins et al., 1991). The transformation<br>
efficiency was even lower when particle bombardment<br>
method was used (Keller et al., 1997). A difference in<br>
the type of explants used for transformation could have<br>
a significant effect on the efficiency of<br>
transformation and regeneration. It has been reported,<br>
for example, that for reducing false positive<br>
transformants, cotyledon was a better explant than<br>
hypocotyledon (Firoozabady et al., 1987).<br>
Cotton transformation also is highly dependent on<br>
genotype (Trolinder, 1985a, 1986; Trolinder &amp; Goodin,<br>
1987, 1988a, 1988b; Trolinder &amp; Chen, 1989). Apart<br>
from a few cultivars which are regenerable and<br>
transformable, such as Gossypium hirsutum cv. Coker 312<br>
and G. hirsutum Jin 7, most other important elite<br>
commercial cultivars, such as G. hirsutum cv. D&amp;P 5415<br>
and G. hirsutum cv. Zhongmian 12, are not regeneratable<br>
and transformable by these methods. The absence of a<br>
high-efficiency plant regeneration method has been<br>
regarded as a major obstacle to the application of<br>
Agrabacterium-mediated transformation to cotton (Gawel<br>
et al., 1986; Firoozabady et al., 1987).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
To overcome the problems associated with<br>
previously reported methods, an efficient<br>
transformation procedure using petiole as an explant<br>
has been developed, along with a set of correspondingly<br>
improved media. This method provides several<br>
advantages in comparison to the hypocotyl and cotyledon<br>
methods: (1) explants are easy to obtain; (2)<br>
transformation efficiency is higher; (3) Agrobacterium<br>
contamination is very rare; (4) efficiency in<br>
regeneration is higher; and (5) the time from<br>
transformation to regeneration of plantlets is reduced.<br>
Two cotton varieties, i.e. Coker 312 and Si-Mian 3,<br>
have been successfully transformed with this method,<br>
and more than 30 independent transgenic lines from<br>
Coker 312 showing strong activity of the marker<br>
transgene have been obtained. This method is<br>
applicable to other cotton varicties such as Jin 7 and<br>
Ji 713 from China, Siokra 1-3 from Australia, T25,<br>
Coker 201 and Coker 310 from the U.S.A.<br>
Brief Description of the Figure<br>
Figure 1 shows the plasmid pBI121GFP, containing<br>
GFP as the reporter gene and the NPT II (neomycin<br>
phosphotransferase) gene as a selectable marker, used<br>
for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cotton<br>
petiole according to the methods of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
An efficient method is disclosed for genetic<br>
transformation of cotton plants, including elite lines,<br>
using cotton peticl- as an explant. By using petiole<br>
explants plus a lot of improved media, transformation<br>
efficiency is significantly enhanced and the time<br>
required from transformation to regeneration is<br>
shortened in comparison to previously reported methods.<br>
By using the methods of the present invention, the<br>
whole process from Agrobacterlum transformation to the<br>
regeneration of transgenic plantlets can take about 6-7<br>
months. The reported hypocotyl and cotyledon methods<br>
usually required 7-9 months or longer to complete the<br>
same process (Cousins et al., 1991; Chen et al.,<br>
unreported observation) . Another two months were<br>
required for growing the small plantlets to a suitable<br>
size for potting in soil.<br>
Techniques for introducing exogenous genes into<br>
Agrobacterium such that they will be transferred stably<br>
to a plant or plant tissue exposed to the Agrobacterium<br>
are well-known in the art and do not form part of the<br>
present invention. It is advantageous to use a so-<br>
called "disarmed" strain of Agrobacterium or Ti<br>
plasmid, that is, a strain or plasroid wherein the genes<br>
responsible for the formation of the tumor<br>
characteristic of the crown gall disease caused by<br>
wild-type Agrobacterium are removed or deactivated.<br>
Numerous examples of disarmed Agrobacterium strains are<br>
found in the literature (e.g., pAL4404, pEHAlOl and pEH<br>
105 (Walkerpeach &amp; Veltern, 1994)). It is further<br>
advantageous to use a so-called binary vector system,<br>
such as that described in Schilperoort et al., 1990,<br>
1995. A binary vector system allows for manipulation<br>
in E. coli of the plasmid carrying the exogenous gene<br>
to be introduced into the plant, making the process of<br>
vector construction much easier to carry out.<br>
Similarly, vector construction, including the<br><br>
construction of chimeric genes comprising tne exogenous<br>
gene that one desires to introduce into the plant, can<br>
be carried out using techniques well-known in the art<br>
and does not form part of the present invention.<br>
Chimeric genes should comprise promoters that have<br>
activity in the host in which expression is desired.<br>
For example, it is advantageous to have a series of<br>
selectable markers for selection of transformed cells<br>
at various stages in the transformation process. A<br>
selectable marker (for example a gene conferring<br>
resistance to an antibiotic such as kanamycin,<br>
cefotaxime or streptomycin) linked to a promoter active<br>
in bacteria would permit selection of bacteria<br>
containing the marker (i.e., transformants). Another<br>
selectable marker linked to a plant-active promoter,<br>
such as the CaMV 35S promoter or a T-DNA promoter such<br>
as the NPT II NOS promoter, would allow selection of<br>
transformed plant cells. The exogenous gene that is<br>
desired to be introduced into the plant cell should<br>
comprise a plant-active promoter in functional relation<br>
to the coding sequence, so that the promoter drives<br>
expression of the gene in the transformed plant.<br>
Again, plant-active promoters, such as the CaMV 35S,<br>
the NPT II NOS promoter or any of a number of tissue-<br>
specific promoters, are well-known in the art and<br>
selection of an appropriate promoter is well within the<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The present method can be used to produce<br>
transgenic plants expressing any number of exogenous<br>
genes, and is not limited by the choice of such a gene.<br>
The selection of the desired exogenous geno depends on<br>
the goal of the researcher, and numerous examples of<br>
desirable genes that could be used with the present<br>
invention are known in the art e.g., the family of<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis toxin genes, herbicide<br>
resistance genes such as shikimate synthase genes that<br>
confer glyphosate resistance, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,188,642, or a 2,4-D monooxygenase gene that confers<br>
resistance to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D),<br>
Bayley et al., Theoretical and Applied Genetics, vol.<br>
82, pp. 645-4 9, male sterility genes such as the<br>
antisense genes of U.S. Patent No. 5,741,684<br>
(Fabijanski, et al.), or even the elaborate crop<br>
protection systems described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,723,765 (Oliver et al.)).<br>
Cotton regeneration is considered in the art to be<br>
heavily variety-dependant. The Coker series of cotton<br>
varieties have been shown to be relatively easy to<br>
transform. However, DP 5412, Zhongmain 12 and many<br>
other varieties still have difficulties associated with<br>
regeneration. The situation is the same for G.<br>
barbadense and other diploid species. While somatic<br>
embryogenesis and regeneration of whole plants is a<br>
highly genotype-dependent process in cotton, successful<br>
transformation and regeneration of two distinct cotton<br>
varieties, i.e. Coker 312 from U.S.A. and Si-Mian 3<br>
from China, has been demonstrated using the methods of<br>
the present invention. It this therefor believed that<br>
the present invention has wide applicability to<br>
transformation of a variety of cotton lines.<br>
Transgene integration in the genome of cotton<br>
produced by the methods of the present invention was<br>
confirmed using standard Southern hybridization<br>
techniques, as can identification of the copy number of<br>
the inserted transgene in each transgenic line (see<br>
Example 6, below}. The F1 generation of transgenic<br>
cotton can be tested for the presence of Lhe transgene,<br>
and inheritance pattern of che transgene in tne Fl<br>
generation can be analyzed to confirm stability and<br>
inheritability.<br>
As compared with other reported protocols, the<br>
cotton transformation system of the present invention<br>
has higher transformation efficiency and survival rate.<br>
This is attributable to several factors. In the<br>
present invention, petiole was used as an explant for<br>
transformation. Different types of cotton explants can<br>
have significant effects on the efficiencies of plant<br>
transformation and regeneration (Firoozabady et al.,<br>
1987). Induction of somatic embryogenesis from petiole<br>
was reported previously. But regeneration was either<br>
unsuccessful or very poor (Finer and Smith, 1984; Gawel<br>
et al., 1986). With the present invention, the<br>
efficiency of regeneration was significantly improved<br>
by using the improved media discussed below, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, calli of high quality were<br>
obtained when tender petioles rich in parenchyma cell<br>
in primary vascular bundle tissue were cultured in the<br>
MMSI medum (described below) with low concentrations<br>
of_2,4-D_and_Kinetin.<br>
With the present invention, the Lime for embryo<br>
induction in suspension culture can be shortened to 10<br>
- 14 days, from a previously reported 3 weeks (Cousins<br>
et al., 1991). It was found that a shortened period of<br>
suspension culture treatment is important for high<br>
frequency induction of embryogenesis. It is also<br>
important for reducing production of abnormal embryos,<br>
since a high percentage of vitreous embryos that are<br>
poor in regeneration are produced when cotton calli are<br>
maintained in suspension culture for too long (Chen et<br>
al, unpublished observation).<br>
Fr- maximum cell growth at different stages except<br>
at the young plant growing stage, glucose was used as<br>
the sole carbon source. The amount of glucose in the<br>
media can be from about 10 to about 50 g/1, preferably<br>
about 30 g/1. At the young ? '---' growing stage,<br>
glucose and sucrose at about 10 g/1 respectively as<br>
carbon sources are preferable for promotion of healthy<br>
plantlets growth.<br>
For growth of callus, embryogenesis and callus<br>
proliferation, pH range can be from 5.8 to 7.5,<br>
preferably pH 6.2 - 7.0, most preferably at pH 6.5. A<br>
medium of pH 7.0 is preferable lor healthy root growth<br>
of plantlets.<br>
For effective callus initiation and induction of<br>
the potency of embryogenesis, low concentrations of<br>
2,4-D and kinetin in the callus induction and selection<br>
medium is important. The amount of 2,4-D can be from<br>
0.05 to 0.5 mg/1, preferably about 0.05 mg/1. The<br>
amount of kinetin can be from 0.1 mg/1 to about 1.0<br>
mg/1, preferably about 0.1 mg/1. In the callus<br>
differentiation stage and exnbryoid germination stage/<br>
best result were obtained when no plant hormone was<br>
added to the media.<br>
The amino acids asparagine and glutamine are<br>
better nitrogen sources than inorganic ammonia nitrogen<br>
for specifically supporting embryoids germination and<br>
root development. In the embryoid germination medium,<br>
the amount of asparagine can be about 200 to about 1000<br>
mg/1, preferably about 500 mg/1. The amount of<br>
glutamine can be about 500 to about 2000 mg/1,<br>
preferably about 1000 mg/1. With these optimized<br>
nitrogen sources, the growth of non-embryogenic calli<br>
was inhibited while the germination, growth and root<br>
development of embryoids were preferentially promoted.<br>
At different stages of cotton transformation<br>
except co-culture with Agrobacterium, plant tissue and<br>
callus are preferably maintained at 28°C but can be<br>
varied from 25-35°C. For effective transformation,<br>
temperature in co-culture stage should not be higher<br>
than 28°C. A light condition of 16 hrs. light (60-90,<br>
mEm-2S-1) and 8 hrs. dark per day is preferable for all<br>
stages of cotton transformation and regeneration.<br>
Unlike previously reported transformation and<br>
regeneration protocols (Umbeck et al., 1987;<br>
Firoozabady et al., 1987, Cousins et al.), the media<br>
used in the present invention are optimized in several<br>
respects: (a) glucose is used as a sole carbon source<br>
in all culture media except in the medium used to<br>
culture young plants previous to planting out in the<br>
greenhouse; (b) the media is adjusted to higher pH<br>
value (6.5-7.0); (c) lower concentration of 2,4-D<br>
(0.05mg/l) and kinetin (0.1 mg/1) is U3ed only at<br>
callus initiation stage, no hormone is used at other<br>
stages; (d) asparagine and glutamine are used to<br>
replace inorganic ammoniac nitrogen in the medium. used<br>
for embryoid germination. These modifications are<br>
adapted for the physiological requirement of cotton<br>
embryoid development and plantlet growth. It has been<br>
found that healthy embryoid development and plantlet<br>
growth, especially root system. development, are largely<br>
attributable to these optimized media. For example, it<br>
has been found that asparagine and glutamine were<br>
better nitrogen source than inorganic ammonia nitrogen<br>
for supporting embryoid germination and root<br>
development. In the preferred MMS3 medium (described<br>
below) , which contains asparagine and glutamine as the<br>
nitrogen source, the growth of non-embryogenic calli<br>
was inhibited while the germination, growth and root<br>
development of embryoids were preferentially promoted.<br>
Because of the healthy root development, the survival<br>
rate of potted transgenic cotton plants obtained by the<br>
methods of the present invention is almost 100%,. With<br>
the reported hypocotyl and cotyledon protocols (Umbeck<br>
et al., 1987; Firoozabady et al., 1967), poor root<br>
development has been regarded as the main reason<br>
accounting for poor survival rate of potted transgenic<br>
cotton plants.<br>

The following Examples are intended to illustrate<br>
the present invention, and not in any way to limit its<br>
scope, which is solely defined by the claims.<br>
Example 1 : Agrobacterium strain and plasmids<br>
A. tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 (pBI121GFP) was<br>
used for transformation of cotton petiole and young<br>
stem. The physical map of pBI121GFP is shown in Fig.l,<br>
which contains GFP as a reporter gene and NPTII gene<br>
(encoding neomycin phosphotransferase) as a selectable<br>
marker. The GFP and NPTTT genes are under the control<br>
of CaMV 35S promoter and nos promoter respectively.<br>
For construction of pBI121GFP, a 720 bp XbaI-SstI<br>
fragment of GFP gene from the pGFP2 plasmid (from Dr.<br>
N. H. Chua, Rockefeller University, New York) was<br>
cloned into the same sites in plasmid vector pBI121<br>
(Clontech) to replace the GUS gene. The pBI12lGFP<br>
plasmid was introduced into A. tumefaciens LBA 4404 by<br>
electroporation.<br>
Example 2: Plant material<br>
Upland cotton varieties Coker 312 from the O.S.A,<br>
and Si-Mian 3 from Shanxi Cotton Research Institute in<br>
China were used in the experiments.<br>
Tender petioles were collected from plants 8-12<br>
weeks old grown in a greenhouse with low light<br>
conditions. The petioles were surface-sterilized with<br>
70% ethanol for a few seconds, followed by 20% bleach<br>
solution (Clorox Co, USA, 1% available chlorine) for 20<br>
min. After rinsing five times in sterilized water, the<br>
petioles were pre-cultured in MS medium for 3 days.<br>
Example 3: Plant transformation<br>
A single colony of A. tumefaciens strain LBA 4404<br>
CpBI121GPP) was inoculated in liquid LB medium with 50<br>
mg/L Rifampicin, 50 mg/L kanamycin and 100 mg/L<br>
streptomycin. The bacteria was grown overnight at 28°C<br>
in a shaker of 200 rpm. The bacterium cultures were<br>
dilute using liquid MS medium to OD600 = 0.3.<br>
The petiole and young stem were cut into about 2<br>
cm long segments. The segments were soaked in the<br>
diluted bacterium suspension for 5 min, then<br>
transferred onto plastic plates (100 x 25 mm)<br>
containing a filter paper soaked in 50 ml of co-culture<br>
medium. The plates were kept in an incubator of 24oC<br>
under continuous light for 4 8 hrs. The co-cultured<br>
explants were transferred onto MMS1 medium and<br>
incubated at 28°C with 16 hrs light (60-90,mEm-2s-1) and<br>
8 hrs dark per day. After 2-4 weeks calli were<br>
initiated at the cut ends of petiole segments. After<br>
4-6 weeks kanamycin resistant calli had appeared, and<br>
the number of calli were counted and the expression of<br>
GFP gene was examined.<br>
Under the fluorescence microscope, the<br>
untransformed control callus appeared red in colour,<br>
while the transformed callus expressing GFP gene<br>
displayed distinct green fluorescence. A total of 113<br>
putative transformed calli were examined for GFP<br>
activity, the transformation frequency of GFP gene was<br>
39.8% (Table 1). When petioles from cotton variety<br>
Si-Mian 3 were used for transformation, 11 calli were<br>
found GFP positive from 26 calli tested, transformation<br>
efficiency was 42.3%.<br>

cotton Coker 312 and Si-Main 3<br><br>
i<br>
Example 4: Induction of somatic embryogenesis and plant<br>
regeneration<br>
The calli with vigorous growth and strong<br>
expression of GFP were selected and transferred into<br>
liquid MMS2 medium for suspension culture tor 2 weeks.<br>
Friable cream-colored granular calli were selected and<br>
transferred to semi-solid differential medium, MMS2.<br>
After about 2 months a large number of embryoids were<br>
produced. Cytoplasmic dense embryogenic structures<br>
were gradually developed and large embryos were<br>
produced on the medium within 1-2 month. A short time<br>
of suspension culture treatment was very important, not<br>
only for high frequencies of embryogenesis induction,<br>
but also for production of embryoids of good quality.<br>
Expression of CFP gene was checked again and all were<br>
GFP positive.<br>
The embryoids and embryogenic calli with strong<br>
GFP activity were transferred onto the MMS3 medium.<br>
After 1-2 months the plantlets that were about 1-2 cm<br>
in height with 1-2 true leaves and good root<br>
development were transferred to the Young Plant Growing<br>
Medium for about one month. About one month later,<br>
young plants with 6-8 leaves and about 10-15 cm in<br>
height were potted in soil and move to the glasshouse.<br>
All 30 potted transgenic plants survived and were found<br>
expressing GFP protein. The total time required to<br>
obtain transgenic plantlets using was under 7 months,<br>
and plantlets were reading for potting out in the<br>
greenhouse in about 2 additional months (see Table 2).<br>
Table 2: The time frame from transformation of petiole<br>
segments to plant regeneration (Coker 312)<br><br>
Example 5: Detection of GFP Protein Activity<br>
The expression of GFP protein activity was<br>
Geteeted using a Leica MZ FLIIT Fluorescence stereo<br>
microscope with a 480/40 nM excitation filter and a 510<br>
nM barrier filter.<br>
Green fluorescence of GFP gene can be easily<br>
distinguished in the transformed callus, embryoids, and<br>
young plantlets, with the untransformed control<br>
appeared red in colour under the fluorescence Stereo<br>
microscope. The exceptions were the untransformed<br>
roots, which appeared dim green under the fluorescence<br>
microscope, probably due to some chromophorous<br>
chemicals accumulated in roots. But the roots with GFP<br>
activity could still be identified because the green<br>
fluorescence produced by GFP protein was brighter and<br>
appeared more uniform. Under the blue light produced<br>
by the fluorescence stereo microscope, red fluorescence<br>
is clearly visible in untraneformed green plant tissues<br>
that are enriched with chlorophyll such as leaf and<br>
stem. In GFP-positive green plant tissues, yellow<br>
fluorescence also was detected because of the<br>
overlapping of red and green fluorescence. However,<br>
the expression of GFP gene in petal and anther was<br>
poorer in comparison to that in other parts of plant.<br>
Example 6: Analysis of Transgenic Plants<br>
Genomic DNA from putatively transformed lines and<br>
non-transformed control plants was purified according<br>
to Paterson et all. (1993). After digestion with EcoRI,<br>
which cuts inj-between left border of T-DNA and Nos-3'<br>
terminator of the chimerical GFP gene (Fig. 1), DNA was<br>
separated on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel and transferred to<br>
Hybond-N membrane according to manuracturer's<br>
instructions. DNA was fixed to the membrane by UV<br>
crossing linking before hybridizing to the DIG labeled<br>
coding region of the GFP gene. Hybridized probe was<br>
detected with anti-DIG-AP conjugate according to<br>
manufacturer's instructions (BOEHRINGER MANNHEIM) .<br>
The genomic DNA samples from 11 randomly selected<br>
transgenic lines and 1 untransformed control plant were<br>
analyzed Southern hybridization, using the coding<br>
region of GFP gene as the hybridization probe. The<br>
data indicate that 7 out of 11 lines have a single<br>
copy, 3 lines have 2 copies, and 1 line has 6 copies of<br>
T-DNA insertion. The high percentage of transgenic<br>
lines with a single copy of T-DNA insertion suggests<br>
that this transformation protocol has less risk of gene<br>
silencing and undesirable insertion mutants.<br>
