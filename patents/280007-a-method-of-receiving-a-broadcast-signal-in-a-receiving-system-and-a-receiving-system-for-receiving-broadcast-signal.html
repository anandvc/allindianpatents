Description<br>
DIGITAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND METHOD OF<br>
PROCESSING DATA IN DIGITAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ]	The present invention relates to a digital broadcasting system and a method of<br>
processing data in a digital broadcasting system for transmitting and receiving digital<br>
broadcast signals.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The Vestigial Sideband (VSB) transmission mode, which is adopted as the standard<br>
for digital broadcasting in North America and the Republic of Korea, is a system using<br>
a single carrier method. Therefore, the receiving performance of the digital broadcast<br>
receiving system may be deteriorated in a poor channel environment. Particularly,<br>
since resistance to changes in channels and noise is more highly required when using<br>
portable and/or mobile broadcast receivers, the receiving performance may be even<br>
more deteriorated when transmitting mobile service data by the VSB transmission<br>
mode.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[3]	Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting<br>
system and a data processing method that are highly resistant to channel changes and<br>
noise.<br>
[4]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system<br>
and a data processing method that can receive and process mobile service data and<br>
access information of the respective mobile service data.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[5]	To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a receiving system includes a<br>
baseband processor, an IP network stack, and a handler. The baseband processor<br>
receives a broadcast signal including mobile service data and main service data.<br>
Herein, the mobile service data configures a Reed-Solomon (RS) frame, and the RS<br>
frame includes mobile service data and an internet protocol (IP) signaling channel<br>
having pre-decided IP access information included therein. The IP network stack<br>
accesses the IP signaling channel from the RS frame using the IP access information,<br>
thereby collecting signaling table information received through the IP signaling<br>
channel. And. the handler identifies and parses the collected signaling table in-<br>
formation based upon a table identifier of each signaling table received through the IP<br>
 <br>
signaling channel, thereby storing the parsed result.<br>
[6]	Herein, the IP access information may include a target IP address and a target UDP<br>
port number, and the target IP address and target UDP port number of each UDP/IP<br>
packet transmitted through the IP signaling channel may be identical to one another.<br>
Also, the IP signaling channel may be received through at least one of a primary RS<br>
frame and a secondary RS frame, based upon a level of importance of the cor-<br>
responding signaling table. Moreover, the receiving system may further include a<br>
known sequence detector, which detects a known data sequence linearly inserted in at<br>
least one data group configuring the RS frame. Herein, the detected known data<br>
sequence may be used for channel-equalizing the mobile service data.<br>
[7]	In another aspect of the present invention, a method for processing data in a<br>
receiving system includes the steps of receiving a broadcast signal including mobile<br>
service data and main service data, wherein the mobile service data configure a Reed-<br>
Solomon (RS) frame, and wherein the RS frame includes mobile service data and an<br>
internet protocol (IP) signaling channel having pre-decided IP access information<br>
included therein, accessing the IP signaling channel from the RS frame using the IP<br>
access information, thereby collecting signaling table information received through the<br>
IP signaling channel, and identifying and parsing the collected signaling table in-<br>
formation based upon a table identifier of each signaling table received through the IP<br>
signaling channel, thereby storing the parsed result. Herein, the method may further<br>
include detecting a known data sequence linearly inserted in at least one data group<br>
configuring the RS frame.<br>
[8]	Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention may be realized and<br>
attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description as well as<br>
the appended drawings.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[9]	The digital broadcasting system and the data processing method according to the<br>
present invention have the following advantages. The present invention assigns an IP<br>
signaling channel having a well-known target IP address and a well-known target UDP<br>
port number to each ensemble. Then, the present invention transmits a signaling table<br>
describing information required for service access through the IP signaling channel.<br>
Therefore, after configuring the ensembles, the digital broadcast receiving system<br>
according to the present invention opens an IP socket for an IP stream having the cor-<br>
responding well-known target IP address and well-known target UDP port number.<br>
[10]	More specifically, the digital broadcast receiving system may access the IP signaling<br>
channel without requesting for any separate information. Furthermore, by using a table<br>
identifier included in a header of each signaling table, the digital broadcast receiving<br>
 <br>
system according to the present invention can find (or locate) a desired signaling table<br>
from the corresponding IP stream.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[43]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[44]<br>
[45]	Definition of the terms used in the present invention<br>
[46]	In addition, although the terms used in the present invention are selected from<br>
generally known and used terms, some of the terms mentioned in the description of the<br>
present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her discretion, the<br>
detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein.<br>
Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood, not simply by the<br>
actual terms used but by the meaning of each term lying within.<br>
[47]	Among the terms used in the description of the present invention, main service data<br>
correspond to data that can be received by a fixed receiving system and may include<br>
audio/video (A/V) data. More specifically, the main service data may include A/V data<br>
of high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) levels and may also include diverse<br>
data types required for data broadcasting. Also, the known data correspond to data pre-<br>
known in accordance with a pre-arranged agreement between the receiving system and<br>
the transmitting system.<br>
[48]	Additionally, among the terms used in the present invention, "MH" corresponds to<br>
the initials of "mobile" and "handheld" and represents the opposite concept of a fixed-<br>
type system. Furthermore, the MH service data may include at least one of mobile<br>
service data and handheld service data, and will also be referred to as "mobile service<br>
data" for simplicity. Herein, the mobile service data not only correspond to MH service<br>
data but may also include any type of service data with mobile or portable charac-<br>
teristics. Therefore, the mobile service data according to the present invention are not<br>
limited only to the MH service data.<br>
[49]	The above-described mobile service data may correspond to data having information,<br>
such as program execution files, stock information, and so on, and may also<br>
correspond to A/V data. Most particularly, the mobile service data may correspond to<br>
A/V data having lower resolution and lower data rate as compared to the main service<br>
data. For example, if an A/V codec that is used for a conventional main service<br>
corresponds to a MPEG-2 codec, a MPEG-4 advanced video coding (AVC) or scalable<br>
video coding (SVC) having better image compression efficiency may be used as the A/<br>
V codec for the mobile service. Furthermore, any type of data may be transmitted as<br>
the mobile service data. For example, transport protocol expert group (TPEG) data for<br>
broadcasting real-time transportation information may be transmitted as the main<br>
service data.<br>
 <br>
[50]	Also, a data service using the mobile service data may include weather forecast<br>
services, traffic information services, stock information services, viewer participation<br>
quiz programs, real-time polls and surveys, interactive education broadcast programs,<br>
gaming services, services providing information on synopsis, character, background<br>
music, and filming sites of soap operas or series, services providing information on<br>
past match scores and player profiles and achievements, and services providing in-<br>
formation on product information and programs classified by service, medium, time,<br>
and theme enabling purchase orders to be processed. Herein, the present invention is<br>
not limited only to the services mentioned above.<br>
[51]	In the present invention, the transmitting system provides backward compatibility in<br>
the main service data so as to be received by the conventional receiving system.<br>
Herein, the main service data and the mobile service data are multiplexed to the same<br>
physical channel and then transmitted.<br>
[52]	Furthermore, the transmitting system according to the present invention performs<br>
additional encoding on the mobile service data and inserts the data already known by<br>
the receiving system and transmitting system (e.g., known data), thereby transmitting<br>
the processed data.<br>
[53]	Therefore, when using the transmitting system according to the present invention, the<br>
receiving system may receive the mobile service data during a mobile state and may<br>
also receive the mobile service data with stability despite various distortion and noise<br>
occurring within the channel.<br>
[54]<br>
[55]	Receiving System<br>
[56]	FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing a general structure of a receiving system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The receiving system according<br>
to the present invention includes a baseband processor 100, a management processor<br>
200, and a presentation processor 300.<br>
[57]	The baseband processor 100 includes an operation controller 110, a tuner 120, a de-<br>
modulator 130, an equalizer 140, a known sequence detector (or known data detector)<br>
150, a block decoder (or mobile handheld block decoder) 160, a primary Reed-<br>
Solomon (RS) frame decoder 170, a secondary RS frame decoder 180, and a signaling<br>
decoder 190.<br>
[58]	The operation controller 110 controls the operation of each block included in the<br>
baseband processor 100.<br>
[59]	By tuning the receiving system to a specific physical channel frequency, the tuner<br>
120 enables the receiving system to receive main service data, which correspond to<br>
broadcast signals for fixed-type broadcast receiving systems, and mobile service data,<br>
which correspond to broadcast signals for mobile broadcast receiving systems. At this<br>
 <br>
point, the tuned frequency of the specific physical channel is down-converted to an in-<br>
termediate frequency (IF) signal, thereby being outputted to the demodulator 130 and<br>
the known sequence detector 140. The passband digital IF signal being outputted from<br>
the tuner 120 may only include main service data, or only include mobile service data,<br>
or include both main service data and mobile service data.<br>
[60]	The demodulator 130 performs self-gain control, carrier recovery, and timing<br>
recovery processes on the passband digital IF signal inputted from the tuner 120,<br>
thereby translating the IF signal to a baseband signal. Then, the demodulator 130<br>
outputs the baseband signal to the equalizer 140 and the known sequence detector 150.<br>
The demodulator 130 uses the known data symbol sequence inputted from the known<br>
sequence detector 150 during the timing and/or carrier recovery, thereby enhancing the<br>
demodulating performance.<br>
[61]	The equalizer 140 compensates channel-associated distortion included in the signal<br>
demodulated by the demodulator 130. Then, the equalizer 140 outputs the distortion-<br>
compensated signal to the block decoder 160. By using a known data symbol sequence<br>
inputted from the known sequence detector 150, the equalizer 140 may enhance the<br>
equalizing performance. Furthermore, the equalizer 140 may receive feed-back on the<br>
decoding result from the block decoder 160, thereby enhancing the equalizing<br>
performance.<br>
[62]	The known sequence detector 150 detects known data place (or position) inserted by<br>
the transmitting system from the input/output data (i.e., data prior to being de-<br>
modulated or data being processed with partial demodulation). Then, the known<br>
sequence detector 150 outputs the detected known data position information and<br>
known data sequence generated from the detected position information to the de-<br>
modulator 130 and the equalizer 140. Additionally, in order to allow the block decoder<br>
160 to identify the mobile service data that have been processed with additional<br>
encoding by the transmitting system and the main service data that have not been<br>
processed with any additional encoding, the known sequence detector 150 outputs such<br>
corresponding information to the block decoder 160.<br>
[63]	If the data channel-equalized by the equalizer 140 and inputted to the block decoder<br>
160 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and trellis-encoding by the<br>
transmitting system (i.e., data within the RS frame, signaling data), the block decoder<br>
160 may perform trellis-decoding and block-decoding as inverse processes of the<br>
transmitting system. On the other hand, if the data channel-equalized by the equalizer<br>
140 and inputted to the block decoder 160 correspond to data processed only with<br>
trellis-encoding and not block-encoding by the transmitting system (i.e.. main service<br>
data), the block decoder 160 may perform only trellis-decoding.<br>
[64]	The signaling decoder 190 decoded signaling data that have been channel-equalized<br>
 <br>
and inputted from the equalizer 140. It is assumed that the signaling data inputted to<br>
the signaling decoder 190 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and<br>
trellis-encoding by the transmitting system. Examples of such signaling data may<br>
include transmission parameter channel (TPC) data and fast information channel (F1C)<br>
data. Each type of data will be described in more detail in a later process. The FIC data<br>
decoded by the signaling decoder 190 are outputted to the FIC handler 215. And, the<br>
TPC data decoded by the signaling decoder 190 are outputted to the TPC handler 214.<br>
[65]	Meanwhile, according to the present invention, the transmitting system uses RS<br>
frames by encoding units. Herein, the RS frame may be divided into a primary RS<br>
frame and a secondary RS frame. However, according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame will be divided<br>
based upon the level of importance of the corresponding data.<br>
[66]	The primary RS frame decoder 170 receives the data outputted from the block<br>
decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
primary RS frame decoder 170 receives only the mobile service data that have been<br>
Reed-Solomon (RS)-encoded and/or cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-encoded from the<br>
block decoder 160. Herein, the primary RS frame decoder 170 receives only the<br>
mobile service data and not the main service data. The primary RS frame decoder 170<br>
performs inverse processes of an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the<br>
transmitting system, thereby correcting errors existing within the primary RS frame.<br>
More specifically, the primary RS frame decoder 170 forms a primary RS frame by<br>
grouping a plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in primary RS frame units.<br>
In other words, the primary RS frame decoder 170 decodes primary RS frames, which<br>
are being transmitted for actual broadcast services.<br>
[67]	Additionally, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives the data outputted from<br>
the block decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data<br>
that have been RS-encoded and/or CRC-encoded from the block decoder 160. Herein,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data and not the<br>
main service data. The secondary RS frame decoder 180 performs inverse processes of<br>
an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system, thereby<br>
correcting errors existing within the secondary RS frame. More specifically, the<br>
secondary RS frame decoder 180 forms a secondary RS frame by grouping a plurality<br>
of data groups and, then, correct errors in secondary RS frame units. In other words,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 decodes secondary RS frames, which are being<br>
transmitted for mobile audio service data, mobile video service data, guide data, and so<br>
on.<br>
[68]	Meanwhile, the management processor 200 according to an embodiment of the<br>
 <br>
present invention includes an MH physical adaptation processor 210, an IP network<br>
stack 220, a streaming handler 230, a system information (SI) handler 240, a file<br>
handler 250, a multi-purpose internet main extensions (MIME) type handler 260, and<br>
an electronic service guide (ESG) handler 270, and an ESG decoder 280, and a storage<br>
unit 290.<br>
[69]	The MH physical adaptation processor 210 includes a primary RS frame handler 211,<br>
a secondary RS frame handler 212, an MH transport packet (TP) handler 213, a TPC<br>
handler 214, an FIC handler 215, and a physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
[70]	The TPC handler 214 receives and processes baseband information required by<br>
modules corresponding to the MH physical adaptation processor 210. The baseband in-<br>
formation is inputted in the form of TPC data. Herein, the TPC handler 214 uses this<br>
information to process the FIC data, which have been sent from the baseband processor<br>
100.<br>
[71]	The TPC data are transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system<br>
via a predetermined region of a data group. The TPC data may include at least one of<br>
an MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG),<br>
an RS frame continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version<br>
number.<br>
[72]	Herein, the MH ensemble ID indicates an identification number of each MH<br>
ensemble carried in the corresponding channel.<br>
[73]	The MH sub-frame number signifies a number identifying the MH sub-frame number<br>
in an MH frame, wherein each MH group associated with the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble is transmitted.<br>
[74]	The TNoG represents the total number of MH groups including all of the MH groups<br>
belonging to all MH parades included in an MH sub-frame.<br>
[75]	The RS frame continuity counter indicates a number that serves as a continuity<br>
counter of the RS frames carrying the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the value<br>
of the RS frame continuity counter shall be incremented by 1 modulo 16 for each<br>
successive RS frame.<br>
[76]	N represents the column size of an RS frame belonging to the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble. Herein, the value of N determines the size of each MH TP.<br>
[77]	Finally, the FIC version number signifies the version number of an FIC carried on<br>
the corresponding physical channel.<br>
[78 ]	As described above, diverse TPC data are inputted to the TPC handler 214 via the<br>
signaling decoder 190 shown in FIG. 1. Then, the received TPC data are processed by<br>
the TPC handler 214. The received TPC data may also be used by the FIC handler 215<br>
in order to process the FIC data.<br>
|79|	The FIC handler 215 processes the FIC data by associating the FIC data received<br>
 <br>
from the baseband processor 100 with the TPC data.<br>
[80]	The physical adaptation control signal handler 216 collects F1C data received<br>
through the FIC handler 215 and SI data received through RS frames. Then, the<br>
physical adaptation control signal handler 216 uses the collected FIC data and SI data<br>
to configure and process IP datagrams and access information of mobile broadcast<br>
services. Thereafter, the physical adaptation control signal handler 216 stores the<br>
processed IP datagrams and access information to the storage unit 290.<br>
[81]	The primary RS frame handler 211 identifies primary RS frames received from the<br>
primary RS frame decoder 170 of the baseband processor 100 for each row unit, so as<br>
to configure an MH TP. Thereafter, the primary RS frame handler 211 outputs the<br>
configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213.<br>
[82]	The secondary RS frame handler 212 identifies secondary RS frames received from<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 of the baseband processor 100 for each row unit,<br>
so as to configure an MH TP. Thereafter, the secondary RS frame handler 212 outputs<br>
the configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213.<br>
[83]	The MH transport packet (TP) handler 213 extracts a header from each MH TP<br>
received from the primary RS frame handler 211 and the secondary RS frame handler<br>
212, thereby determining the data included in the corresponding MH TP. Then, when<br>
the determined data correspond to SI data (i.e., SI data that are not encapsulated to IP<br>
datagrams), the corresponding data are outputted to the physical adaptation control<br>
signal handler 216. Alternatively, when the determined data correspond to an IP<br>
datagram, the corresponding data are outputted to the IP network stack 220.<br>
[84]	The IP network stack 220 processes broadcast data that are being transmitted in the<br>
form of IP datagrams. More specifically, the IP network stack 220 processes data that<br>
are inputted via user datagram protocol (UDP), real-time transport protocol (RTP),<br>
real-time transport control protocol (RTCP), asynchronous layered coding/layered<br>
coding transport (ALC/LCT), file delivery over unidirectional transport (FLUTE), and<br>
so on. Herein, when the processed data correspond to streaming data, the cor-<br>
responding data are outputted to the streaming handler 230. And, when the processed<br>
data correspond to data in a file format, the corresponding data are outputted to the file<br>
handler 250. Finally, when the processed data correspond to SI-associated data, the<br>
corresponding data are outputted to the SI handler 240.<br>
[85]	The SI handler 240 receives and processes SI data having the form of IP datagrams,<br>
which are inputted to the IP network stack 220.<br>
[86]	When the inputted data associated with SI correspond to MIME-type data, the<br>
inputted data are outputted to the MIME-type handler 260.<br>
[87]	The MIME-type handler 260 receives the MIME-type SI data outputted from the SI<br>
handler 240 and processes the received MIME-type SI data.<br>
 <br>
[88]	The file handler 250 receives data from the IP network stack 220 in an object format<br>
in accordance with the ALC/LCT and FLUTE structures. The file handler 250 groups<br>
the received data to create a file format. Herein, when the corresponding file includes<br>
ESG, the file is outputted to the ESG handler 270. On the other hand, when the cor-<br>
responding file includes data for other file-based services, the file is outputted to the<br>
presentation controller 330 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
[89]	The ESG handler 270 processes the ESG data received from the file handler 250 and<br>
stores the processed ESG data to the storage unit 290. Alternatively, the ESG handler<br>
270 may output the processed ESG data to the ESG decoder 280, thereby allowing the<br>
ESG data to be used by the ESG decoder 280.<br>
[90]	The storage unit 290 stores the system information (SI) received from the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 210 and the ESG handler 270 therein. Thereafter, the<br>
storage unit 290 transmits the stored SI data to each block.<br>
[91]	The ESG decoder 280 either recovers the ESG data and SI data stored in the storage<br>
unit 290 or recovers the ESG data transmitted from the ESG handler 270. Then, the<br>
ESG decoder 280 outputs the recovered data to the presentation controller 330 in a<br>
format that can be outputted to the user.<br>
[92]	The streaming handler 230 receives data from the IP network stack 220, wherein the<br>
format of the received data are in accordance with RTP and/or RTCP structures. The<br>
streaming handler 230 extracts audio/video streams from the received data, which are<br>
then outputted to the audio/video (A/V) decoder 310 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
The audio/video decoder 310 then decodes each of the audio stream and video stream<br>
received from the streaming handler 230.<br>
[93]	The display module 320 of the presentation processor 300 receives audio and video<br>
signals respectively decoded by the A/V decoder 310. Then, the display module 320<br>
provides the received audio and video signals to the user through a speaker and/or a<br>
screen.<br>
[94]	The presentation controller 330 corresponds to a controller managing modules that<br>
output data received by the receiving system to the user.<br>
[95]	The channel service manager 340 manages an interface with the user, which enables<br>
the user to use channel-based broadcast services, such as channel map management,<br>
channel service connection, and so on.<br>
[96]	The application manager 350 manages an interface with a user using ESG display or<br>
other application services that do not correspond to channel-based services.<br>
[97]<br>
[98]	Data Format Structure<br>
[99]	Meanwhile, the data structure used in the mobile broadcasting technology according<br>
to the embodiment of the present invention may include a data group structure and an<br>
 <br>
RS frame structure, which will now be described in detail.<br>
[ 100] FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary structure of a data group according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[ 101] FIG. 2 shows an example of dividing a data group according to the data structure of<br>
the present invention into 10 MH blocks (i.e., MH block 1 (B1) to MH block 10<br>
(B10)). In this example, each MH block has the length of 16 segments. Referring to<br>
FIG. 2, only the RS parity data are allocated to portions of the previous 5 segments of<br>
the MH block 1 (B1) and the next 5 segments of the MH block 10 (B10). The RS<br>
parity data are excluded in regions A to D of the data group.<br>
[ 102] More specifically, when it is assumed that one data group is divided into regions A,<br>
B, C, and D, each MH block may be included in any one of region A to region D<br>
depending upon the characteristic of each MH block within the data group. Herein, the<br>
data group is divided into a plurality of regions to be used for different purposes. More<br>
specifically, a region of the main service data having no interference or a very low in-<br>
terference level may be considered to have a more resistant (or stronger) receiving<br>
performance as compared to regions having higher interference levels. Additionally,<br>
when using a system inserting and transmitting known data in the data group, wherein<br>
the known data are known based upon an agreement between the transmitting system<br>
and the receiving system, and when consecutively long known data are to be pe-<br>
riodically inserted in the mobile service data, the known data having a predetermined<br>
length may be periodically inserted in the region having no interference from the main<br>
service data (i.e., a region wherein the main service data are not mixed). However, due<br>
to interference from the main service data, it is difficult to periodically insert known<br>
data and also to insert consecutively long known data to a region having interference<br>
from the main service data.<br>
[ 103] Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) correspond to regions<br>
without interference of the main service data. MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7)<br>
within the data group shown in FIG. 2 correspond to a region where no interference<br>
from the main service data occurs. In this example, a long known data sequence is<br>
inserted at both the beginning and end of each MH block. In the description of the<br>
present invention, the region including MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) will be<br>
referred to as "region A (=B4+B5+B6+B7)". As described above, when the data group<br>
includes region A having a long known data sequence inserted at both the beginning<br>
and end of each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization<br>
by using the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore,<br>
the strongest equalizing performance may be yielded (or obtained) from one of region<br>
A to region D.<br>
[ 104]	In the example of the data group shown in FIG. 2, MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8<br>
 <br>
(B8) correspond to a region having little interference from the main service data.<br>
Herein, a long known data sequence is inserted in only one side of each MH block B3<br>
and B8. More specifically, due to the interference from the main service data, a long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the end of MH block 3 (B3), and another long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the beginning of MH block 8 (B8). In the present<br>
invention, the region including MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8 (B8) will be referred<br>
to as "region B (=B3+B8)". As described above, when the data group includes region<br>
B having a long known data sequence inserted at only one side (beginning or end) of<br>
each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization by using<br>
the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore, a<br>
stronger equalizing performance as compared to region C/D may be yielded (or<br>
obtained).<br>
[105] Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) correspond to a region<br>
having more interference from the main service data as compared to region B. A long<br>
known data sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 2 (B2) and MH block<br>
9 (B9). Herein, the region including MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) will be<br>
referred to as "region C (=B2+B9)".<br>
[106] Finally, in the example shown in FIG. 2, MH block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10)<br>
correspond to a region having more interference from the main service data as<br>
compared to region C. Similarly, a long known data sequence cannot be inserted in any<br>
side of MH block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10). Herein, the region including MH<br>
block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10) will be referred to as "region D (=B1+B10)".<br>
Since region C/D is spaced further apart from the known data sequence, when the<br>
channel environment undergoes frequent and abrupt changes, the receiving<br>
performance of region C/D may be deteriorated.<br>
[107] Additionally, the data group includes a signaling information area wherein signaling<br>
information is assigned (or allocated).<br>
[ 108] In the present invention, the signaling information area may start from the 1st<br>
segment of the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion of the 2nd segment. According to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the signaling information area for inserting<br>
signaling information may start from the 1 st segment of the 4th MH block (B4) to a<br>
portion of the 2nd segment.<br>
[109] More specifically, 276(=207+69) bytes of the 4th MH block (B4) in each data group<br>
are assigned as the signaling information area. In other words, the signaling in-<br>
formation area consists of 207 bytes of the 1st segment and the first 69 bytes of the 2nd<br>
segment of the 4th MH block (B4). The 1st segment of the 4th MH block (B4)<br>
corresponds to the 17th or 173rd segment of a VSB field.<br>
[110]	Herein, the signaling information may be identified by two different types of<br>
 <br>
signaling channels: a transmission parameter channel (TPC) and a fast information<br>
channel (F1C).<br>
[111] Herein, the TPC data may include at least one of an MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-<br>
frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG), an RS frame continuity counter,<br>
a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version number. However, the TPC data<br>
(or information) presented herein are merely exemplary. And, since the adding or<br>
deleting of signaling information included in the TPC data may be easily adjusted and<br>
modified by one skilled in the art, the present invention will, therefore, not be limited<br>
to the examples set forth herein. Furthermore, the FIC is provided to enable a fast<br>
service acquisition of data receivers, and the FIC includes cross layer information<br>
between the physical layer and the upper layer(s).<br>
[112] For example, when the data group includes 6 known data sequences, as shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the signaling information area is located between the first known data sequence<br>
and the second known data sequence. More specifically, the first known data sequence<br>
is inserted in the last 2 segments of the 3rd MH block (B3), and the second known data<br>
sequence in inserted in the 2nd and 3rd segments of the 4th MH block (B4).<br>
Furthermore, the 3rd to 6th known data sequences are respectively inserted in the last 2<br>
segments of each of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th MH blocks (B4, B5, B6, and B7). The 1st<br>
and 3rd to 6th known data sequences are spaced apart by 16 segments.<br>
[113] FIG. 3 illustrates an RS frame according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[114] The RS frame shown in FIG. 3 corresponds to a collection of one or more data<br>
groups. The RS frame is received for each MH frame in a condition where the<br>
receiving system receives the FIC and processes the received FIC and where the<br>
receiving system is switched to a time-slicing mode so that the receiving system can<br>
receive MH ensembles including ESG entry points. Each RS frame includes IP streams<br>
of each service or ESG, and SMT section data may exist in all RS frames.<br>
[115] The RS frame according to the embodiment of the present invention consists of at<br>
least one MH transport packet (TP). Herein, the MH TP includes an MH header and an<br>
MH payload.<br>
[116] The MH payload may include mobile service data as well as signaling data. More<br>
specifically, an MH payload may include only mobile service data, or may include<br>
only signaling data, or may include both mobile service data and signaling data.<br>
[117] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the MH header may identify<br>
(or distinguish) the data types included in the MH payload. More specifically, when<br>
the MH TP includes a first MH header, this indicates that the MH payload includes<br>
only the signaling data. Also, when the MH TP includes a second MH header, this<br>
indicates that the MH payload includes both the signaling data and the mobile service<br>
data. Finally, when MH TP includes a third MH header, this indicates that the MH<br>
 <br>
payload includes only the mobile service data. Signaling information within the MP<br>
payload may further include data on an IP signaling channel having well-known access<br>
information. More specifically, at least a portion of the signaling data may be<br>
transmitted (or delivered) through the IP signaling channel. The IP signaling channel<br>
will be described in more detail later on with reference to FIG. 25.<br>
[118] In the example shown in FIG. 3, the RS frame is assigned with IP datagrams (IP<br>
datagram 1 and IP datagram 2) for two service types.<br>
[119]<br>
[120] Data Transmission Structure<br>
[121] FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a MH frame for transmitting and receiving mobile<br>
service data according to the present invention. In the example shown in FIG. 4, one<br>
MH frame consists of 5 sub-frames, wherein each sub-frame includes 16 slots. In this<br>
case, the MH frame according to the present invention includes 5 sub-frames and 80<br>
slots.<br>
[122] Also, in a packet level, one slot is configured of 156 data packets (i.e., transport<br>
stream packets), and in a symbol level, one slot is configured of 156 data segments.<br>
Herein, the size of one slot corresponds to one half (1/2) of a VSB field. More<br>
specifically, since one 207-byte data packet has the same amount of data as a data<br>
segment, a data packet prior to being interleaved may also be used as a data segment.<br>
At this point, two VSB fields are grouped to form a VSB frame.<br>
[123] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary structure of a VSB frame, wherein one VSB frame<br>
consists of 2 VSB fields (i.e., an odd field and an even field). Herein, each VSB field<br>
includes a field synchronization segment and 312 data segments.<br>
[124] The slot corresponds to a basic time unit for multiplexing the mobile service data and<br>
the main service data. Herein, one slot may either include the mobile service data or be<br>
configured only of the main service data.<br>
[125] If the first 118 data packets within the slot correspond to a data group, the remaining<br>
38 data packets become the main service data packets. In another example, when no<br>
data group exists in a slot, the corresponding slot is configured of 156 main service<br>
data packets.<br>
[126] Meanwhile, when the slots are assigned to a VSB frame, an off-set exists for each<br>
assigned position.<br>
[127] FIG. 6 illustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a<br>
sub-frame are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a spatial area. And, FIG. 7 il-<br>
lustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a sub-frame<br>
are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a chronological (or time) area.<br>
[128]	Referring to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7. a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 1 st slot (Slot<br>
#0) is mapped to the 1st data packet of an odd VSB field. A 38th data packet (TS<br>
 <br>
packet #37) of a 2nd slot (Slot #1) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an odd VSB<br>
field. Also, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 3rd slot (Slot #2) is mapped to the<br>
1st data packet of an even VSB field. And, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 4th<br>
slot (Slot #3) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an even VSB field. Similarly, the<br>
remaining 12 slots within the corresponding sub-frame are mapped in the subsequent<br>
VSB frames using the same method.<br>
[129] FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary assignment order of data groups being assigned to<br>
one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames configure an MH frame. For example,<br>
the method of assigning data groups may be identically applied to all MH frames or<br>
differently applied to each MH frame. Furthermore, the method of assigning data<br>
groups may be identically applied to all sub-frames or differently applied to each sub-<br>
frame. At this point, when it is assumed that the data groups are assigned using the<br>
same method in all sub-frames of the corresponding MH frame, the total number of<br>
data groups being assigned to an MH frame is equal to a multiple of '5'.<br>
[130] According to the embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of consecutive data<br>
groups is assigned to be spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the<br>
sub-frame. Thus, the system can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to<br>
any burst error that may occur within a sub-frame.<br>
[131] For example, when it is assumed that 3 data groups are assigned to a sub-frame, the<br>
data groups are assigned to a 1st slot (Slot #0), a 5th slot (Slot #4), and a 9th slot (Slot<br>
#8) in the sub-frame, respectively. FIG. 8 illustrates an example of assigning 16 data<br>
groups in one sub-frame using the above-described pattern (or rule). In other words,<br>
each data group is serially assigned to 16 slots corresponding to the following<br>
numbers: 0, 8, 4, 12, 1, 9, 5, 13, 2, 10, 6, 14, 3, 11, 7, and 15. Equation 1 below shows<br>
the above-described rule (or pattern) for assigning data groups in a sub-frame.<br>
[132] [Math Figure 1]<br>
[133] <br>
[ 134]	Herein, j indicates the slot number within a sub-frame. The value of j may range from<br>
 <br>
0 to 15 (i.e.,.,<br>
 <br>
). Also, variable i indicates the data group number. The value of i may range from 0 to<br>
15 (i.e.,<br>
 <br>
)•<br>
[135] In the present invention, a collection of data groups included in a MH frame will be<br>
referred to as a "parade". Based upon the RS frame mode, the parade transmits data of<br>
at least one specific RS frame.<br>
[136] The mobile service data within one RS frame may be assigned either to all of regions<br>
A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, or to at least one of regions A/B/C/D. In<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, the mobile service data within one RS frame<br>
may be assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D, or to at least one of regions A/B and<br>
regions C/D. If the mobile service data are assigned to the latter case (i.e., one of<br>
regions A/B and regions C/D), the RS frame being assigned to regions A/B and the RS<br>
frame being assigned to regions C/D within the corresponding data group are different<br>
from one another. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the RS frame<br>
being assigned to regions A/B within the corresponding data group will be referred to<br>
as a "primary RS frame", and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the<br>
corresponding data group will be referred to as a "secondary RS frame", for simplicity.<br>
Also, the primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame form (or configure) one<br>
parade. More specifically, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are<br>
assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, one<br>
parade transmits one RS frame. Conversely, when the mobile service data within one<br>
RS frame are assigned either to at least one of regions A/B and regions C/D, one<br>
parade may transmit up to 2 RS frames.<br>
[137] More specifically, the RS frame mode indicates whether a parade transmits one RS<br>
frame, or whether the parade transmits two RS frames. Such RS frame mode is<br>
transmitted as the above-described TPC data.<br>
[138] Table 1 below shows an example of the RS frame mode.<br>
[139] Table 1<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[140] Table 1 illustrates an example of allocating 2 bits in order to indicate the RS frame<br>
mode. For example, referring to Table 1, when the RS frame mode value is equal to<br>
'00', this indicates that one parade transmits one RS frame. And, when the RS frame<br>
mode value is equal to '01', this indicates that one parade transmits two RS frames,<br>
i.e., the primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame. More specifically, when the<br>
RS frame mode value is equal to '01', data of the primary RS frame for regions A/B<br>
are assigned and transmitted to regions A/B of the corresponding data group. Similarly,<br>
data of the secondary RS frame for regions C/D are assigned and transmitted to regions<br>
C/D of the corresponding data group.<br>
[141] As described in the assignment of data groups, the parades are also assigned to be<br>
spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the sub-frame. Thus, the system<br>
can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to any burst error that may<br>
occur within a sub-frame.<br>
[ 142] Furthermore, the method of assigning parades may be identically applied to all MH<br>
frames or differently applied to each MH frame. According to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the parades may be assigned differently for each MH frame and<br>
identically for all sub-frames within an MH frame. More specifically, the MH frame<br>
structure may vary by MH frame units. Thus, an ensemble rate may be adjusted on a<br>
more frequent and flexible basis.<br>
[ 143] FIG. 9 illustrates an example of multiple data groups of a single parade being<br>
assigned (or allocated) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 9 illustrates an<br>
example of a plurality of data groups included in a single parade, wherein the number<br>
of data groups included in a sub-frame is equal to '3', being allocated to an MH frame.<br>
[144] Referring to FIG. 9. 3 data groups are sequentially assigned to a sub-frame at a cycle<br>
period of 4 slots. Accordingly, when this process is equally performed in the 5 sub-<br>
 <br>
frames included in the corresponding MH frame, 15 data groups are assigned to a<br>
single MH frame. Herein, the 15 data groups correspond to data groups included in a<br>
parade. Therefore, since one sub-frame is configured of 4 VSB frame, and since 3 data<br>
groups are included in a sub-frame, the data group of the corresponding parade is not<br>
assigned to one of the 4 VSB frames within a sub-frame.<br>
[145] For example, when it is assumed that one parade transmits one RS frame, and that a<br>
RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system performs RS-<br>
encoding on the corresponding RS frame, thereby adding 24 bytes of parity data to the<br>
corresponding RS frame and transmitting the processed RS frame, the parity data<br>
occupy approximately 11.37% (=24/(187+24)x100) of the total code word length.<br>
Meanwhile, when one sub-frame includes 3 data groups, and when the data groups<br>
included in the parade are assigned, as shown in FIG. 9, a total of 15 data groups form<br>
an RS frame. Accordingly, even when an error occurs in an entire data group due to a<br>
burst noise within a channel, the percentile is merely 6.67% (=1/15x100). Therefore,<br>
the receiving system may correct all errors by performing an erasure RS decoding<br>
process. More specifically, when the erasure RS decoding is performed, a number of<br>
channel errors corresponding to the number of RS parity bytes may be corrected. By<br>
doing so, the receiving system may correct the error of at least one data group within<br>
one parade. Thus, the minimum burst noise length correctable by a RS frame is over 1<br>
VSB frame.<br>
[146] Meanwhile, when data groups of a parade are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, either<br>
main service data may be assigned between each data group, or data groups cor-<br>
responding to different parades may be assigned between each data group. More<br>
specifically, data groups corresponding to multiple parades may be assigned to one<br>
MH frame.<br>
[147] Basically, the method of assigning data groups corresponding to multiple parades is<br>
very similar to the method of assigning data groups corresponding to a single parade.<br>
In other words, data groups included in other parades that are to be assigned to an MH<br>
frame are also respectively assigned according to a cycle period of 4 slots.<br>
[148] At this point, data groups of a different parade may be sequentially assigned to the<br>
respective slots in a circular method. Herein, the data groups are assigned to slots<br>
starting from the ones to which data groups of the previous parade have not yet been<br>
assigned.<br>
[149] For example, when it is assumed that data groups corresponding to a parade are<br>
assigned as shown in FIG. 9, data groups corresponding to the next parade may be<br>
assigned to a sub-frame starting either from the 12th slot of a sub-frame. However, this<br>
is merely exemplary. In another example, the data groups of the next parade may also<br>
be sequentially assigned to a different slot within a sub-frame at a cycle period of 4<br>
 <br>
slots starting from the 3rd slot.<br>
[ 150] FIG. 10 illustrates an example of transmitting 3 parades (Parade #0, Parade #1, and<br>
Parade #2) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates an example of<br>
transmitting parades included in one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames<br>
configure one MH frame.<br>
[ 151] When the 1st parade (Parade #0) includes 3 data groups for each sub-frame, the<br>
positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting<br>
values '0' to '2' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 1st<br>
parade (Parade #0) are sequentially assigned to the 1st, 5th, and 9th slots (Slot #0, Slot<br>
#4, and Slot #8) within the sub-frame.<br>
[152] Also, when the 2nd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions<br>
of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '3'<br>
and '4' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 2nd parade<br>
(Parade #1) are sequentially assigned to the 2nd and 12th slots (Slot #1 and Slot #11)<br>
within the sub-frame.<br>
f 153] Finally, when the 3rd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions<br>
of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '5'<br>
and '6' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 3rd parade (Parade<br>
#2) are sequentially assigned to the 7th and 11th slots (Slot #6 and Slot #10) within the<br>
sub-frame.<br>
[154] As described above, data groups of multiple parades may be assigned to a single MH<br>
frame, and, in each sub-frame, the data groups are serially allocated to a group space<br>
having 4 slots from left to right.<br>
[155] Therefore, a number of groups of one parade per sub-frame (NoG) may correspond<br>
to any one integer from T to '8'. Herein, since one MH frame includes 5 sub-frames,<br>
the total number of data groups within a parade that can be allocated to an MH frame<br>
may correspond to any one multiple of '5' ranging from '5' to '40'.<br>
[156] FIG. 11 illustrates an example of expanding the assignment process of 3 parades,<br>
shown in FIG. 10, to 5 sub-frames within an MH frame.<br>
[157] FIG. 12 illustrates a data transmission structure according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, wherein signaling data are included in a data group so as to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[ 158] As described above, an MH frame is divided into 5 sub-frames. Data groups cor-<br>
responding to a plurality of parades co-exist in each sub-frame. Herein, the data groups<br>
corresponding to each parade are grouped by MH frame units, thereby configuring a<br>
single parade.<br>
[ 159| The data structure shown in FIG. 12 includes 3 parades, one ESG dedicated channel<br>
(EDC) parade (i.e.. parade with NoG=1), and 2 service parades (i.e.. parade with<br>
 <br>
NoG=4 and parade with NoG=3). Also, a predetermined portion of each data group<br>
(i.e., 37 bytes/data group) is used for delivering (or sending) FIC information<br>
associated with mobile service data, wherein the FIC information is separately encoded<br>
from the RS-encoding process. The FIC region assigned to each data group consists of<br>
one FIC segments. Herein, each segment is interleaved by MH sub-frame units,<br>
thereby configuring an FIC body, which corresponds to a completed FIC transmission<br>
structure. However, whenever required, each segment may be interleaved by MH<br>
frame units and not by MH sub-frame units, thereby being completed in MH frame<br>
units.<br>
[160] Meanwhile, the concept of an MH ensemble is applied in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, thereby defining a collection (or group) of services. Each MH<br>
ensemble carries the same QoS and is coded with the same FEC code. Also, each MH<br>
ensemble has the same unique identifier (i.e., ensemble ID) and corresponds to<br>
consecutive RS frames.<br>
[161] As shown in FIG. 12, the FIC segment corresponding to each data group described<br>
service information of an MH ensemble to which the corresponding data group<br>
belongs. When FIC segments within a sub-frame are grouped and deinterleaved, all<br>
service information of a physical channel through which the corresponding FICs are<br>
transmitted may be obtained. Therefore, the receiving system may be able to acquire<br>
the channel information of the corresponding physical channel, after being processed<br>
with physical channel tuning, during a sub-frame period.<br>
[162] Furthermore, FIG. 12 illustrates a structure further including a separate EDC parade<br>
apart from the service parade and wherein electronic service guide (ESG) data are<br>
transmitted in the 1st slot of each sub-frame.<br>
[163]<br>
[164] Hierarchical Signaling Structure<br>
[165] FIG. 13 illustrates a hierarchical signaling structure according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, the mobile broadcasting technology<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention adopts a signaling method using<br>
FIC and SMT. In the description of the present invention, the signaling structure will<br>
be referred to as a hierarchical signaling structure.<br>
[166] Hereinafter, a detailed description on how the receiving system accesses a virtual<br>
channel via FIC and SMT will now be given with reference to FIG. 13. Herein, the<br>
SMT corresponds to one of multiple signaling tables being received through the IP<br>
signaling channel of the corresponding RS frame.<br>
[ 167] The FIC body defined in an MH transport (M1) identifies the physical location of<br>
each the data stream for each virtual channel and provides very high level descriptions<br>
of each virtual channel.<br>
 <br>
[168] Being MH ensemble level signaling information, the service map table (SMT)<br>
provides MH ensemble level signaling information. The SMT provides the IP access<br>
information of each virtual channel belonging to the respective MH ensemble within<br>
which the SMT is carried. The SMT also provides all IP stream component level in-<br>
formation required for the virtual channel service acquisition.<br>
[169] Referring to FIG. 13, each MH ensemble (i.e., Ensemble 0, Ensemble 1,...,<br>
Ensemble K) includes a stream information on each associated (or corresponding)<br>
virtual channel (e.g., virtual channel 0 IP stream, virtual channel 1 IP stream, and<br>
virtual channel 2 IP stream). For example, Ensemble 0 includes virtual channel 0 IP<br>
stream and virtual channel 1 IP stream. And, each MH ensemble includes diverse in-<br>
formation on the associated virtual channel (i.e., Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry,<br>
Virtual Channel 0 Access Info, Virtual Channel 1 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 1<br>
Access Info, Virtual Channel 2 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 2 Access Info, Virtual<br>
Channel N Table Entry, Virtual Channel N Access Info, and so on).<br>
[170] The FIC body payload includes information on MH ensembles (e.g., ensemble_id<br>
field, and referred to as "ensemble location" in FIG. 13) and information on a virtual<br>
channel associated with the corresponding MH ensemble (e.g., when such information<br>
corresponds to a major_channel_num field and a minor_channel_num field, the in-<br>
formation is expressed as Virtual Channel 0, Virtual Channel 1,..., Virtual Channel N<br>
in FIG. 13).<br>
[171] The application of the signaling structure in the receiving system will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
[172] When a user selects a channel he or she wishes to view (hereinafter, the user-selected<br>
channel will be referred to as "channel θ" for simplicity), the receiving system first<br>
parses the received FIC. Then, the receiving system acquires information on an MH<br>
ensemble (i.e., ensemble location), which is associated with the virtual channel cor-<br>
responding to channel θ (hereinafter, the corresponding MH ensemble will be referred<br>
to as "MH ensemble θ" for simplicity). By acquiring slots only corresponding to the<br>
MH ensemble θ using the time-slicing method, the receiving system configures<br>
ensemble θ. The ensemble θ configured as described above, includes an SMT on the<br>
associated virtual channels (including channel θ) and IP streams on the corresponding<br>
virtual channels. Therefore, the receiving system uses the SMT included in the MH<br>
ensemble θ in order to acquire various information on channel θ (e.g., Virtual Channel<br>
θ Table Entry) and stream access information on channel θ (e.g., Virtual Channel θ<br>
Access Info). The receiving system uses the stream access information on channel θ to<br>
receive only the associated IP streams, thereby providing channel θ services to the<br>
user.<br>
[1731<br>
 <br>
[174] Fast Information Channel (FIC)<br>
[175] The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention adopts the<br>
fast information channel (FIC) for a faster access to a service that is currently being<br>
broadcasted.<br>
[176] More specifically, the FIC handler 215 of FIG. 1 parses the FIC body, which<br>
corresponds to an FIC transmission structure, and outputs the parsed result to the<br>
physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
[177] FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary FIC body format according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the FIC<br>
format consists of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload.<br>
[178] Meanwhile, according to the embodiment of the present invention, data are<br>
transmitted through the FIC body header and the FIC body payload in FIC segment<br>
units. Each FIC segment has the size of 37 bytes, and each FIC segment consists of a<br>
2-byte FIC segment header and a 35-byte FIC segment payload. More specifically, an<br>
FIC body configured of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload, is segmented in<br>
units of 35 data bytes, which are then carried in at least one FIC segment within the<br>
FIC segment payload, so as to be transmitted.<br>
[ 179] In the description of the present invention, an example of inserting one FIC segment<br>
in one data group, which is then transmitted, will be given. In this case, the receiving<br>
system receives a slot corresponding to each data group by using a time-slicing<br>
method.<br>
[180] The signaling decoder 190 included in the receiving system shown in FIG. 1 collects<br>
each FIC segment inserted in each data group. Then, the signaling decoder 190 uses<br>
the collected FIC segments to created a single FIC body. Thereafter, the signaling<br>
decoder 190 performs a decoding process on the FIC body payload of the created FIC<br>
body, so that the decoded FIC body payload corresponds to an encoded result of a<br>
signaling encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system. Subsequently, the<br>
decoded FIC body payload is outputted to the FIC handler 215. The FIC handler 215<br>
parses the FIC data included in the FIC body payload, and then outputs the parsed FIC<br>
data to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. The physical adaptation<br>
control signal handler 216 uses the inputted FIC data to perform processes associated<br>
with MH ensembles, virtual channels, SMTs, and so on.<br>
[181] According to an embodiment of the present invention, when an FIC body is<br>
segmented, and when the size of the last segmented portion is smaller than 35 data<br>
bytes, it is assumed that the lacking number of data bytes in the FIC segment payload<br>
is completed with by adding the same number of stuffing bytes therein, so that the size<br>
of the last FIC segment can be equal to 35 data bytes.<br>
[182]	However, it is apparent that the above-described data byte values (i.e., 37 bytes for<br>
 <br>
the FIC segment, 2 bytes for the FIC segment header, and 35 bytes for the FIC segment<br>
payload) are merely exemplary, and will, therefore, not limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[ 183] FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to an FIC<br>
segment according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[184] Herein, the FIC segment signifies a unit used for transmitting the FIC data. The FIC<br>
segment consists of an FIC segment header and an FIC segment payload. Referring to<br>
FIG. 15, the FIC segment payload corresponds to the portion starting from the 'for'<br>
loop statement. Meanwhile, the FIC segment header may include a FIC_type field, an<br>
error_indicator field, an FIC_seg_number field, and an FIC_last_seg_number field. A<br>
detailed description of each field will now be given.<br>
[ 185] The FIC_type field is a 2-bit field indicating the type of the corresponding FIC.<br>
[186] The error_indicator field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether or not an error has<br>
occurred within the FIC segment during data transmission. If an error has occurred, the<br>
value of the error_indicator field is set to ' 1'. More specifically, when an error that has<br>
failed to be recovered still remains during the configuration process of the FIC<br>
segment, the error_indicator field value is set to '1'. The error_indicator field enables<br>
the receiving system to recognize the presence of an error within the FIC data.<br>
[187] The FIC_seg_number field is a 4-bit field. Herein, when a single FIC body is divided<br>
into a plurality of FIC segments and transmitted, the FIC_seg_number field indicates<br>
the number of the corresponding FIC segment.<br>
[188] Finally, the FIC_last_seg_number field is also a 4-bit field. The<br>
FIC_last_seg_number field indicates the number of the last FIC segment within the<br>
corresponding FIC body.<br>
[189] FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to a payload<br>
of an FIC segment according to the present invention, when an FIC type field value is<br>
equal to '0'.<br>
[190] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the payload of the FIC<br>
segment is divided into 3 different regions.<br>
[191 ] A first region of the FIC segment payload exists only when the FIC_seg_number<br>
field value is equal to '0'. Herein, the first region may include a current_next_indicator<br>
field, an ESG_version field, and a transport_stream_id field. However, depending upon<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, it may be assumed that each of the 3 fields<br>
exists regardless of the FIC_seg_number field.<br>
[192] The current_next_indicator field is a 1-bit field. The current_next_indicator field acts<br>
as an indicator identifying whether the corresponding FTC data carry MH ensemble<br>
configuration information of an MH frame including the current FIC segment, or<br>
whether the corresponding FIC data carry MH ensemble configuration information of a<br>
 <br>
next MH frame.<br>
[ 193] The ESG_version field is a 5-bit field indicating ESG version information. Herein,<br>
by providing version information on the service guide providing channel of the cor-<br>
responding ESG, the ESG_version field enables the receiving system to notify whether<br>
or not the corresponding ESG has been updated.<br>
[194] Finally, the transportstream_id field is a 16-bit field acting as a unique identifier of<br>
a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being transmitted.<br>
[195] A second region of the FIC segment payload corresponds to an ensemble loop<br>
region, which includes an ensemble_id field, an SI_version field, and a num_channel<br>
field.<br>
[196] More specifically, the ensemble_id field is an 8-bit field indicating identifiers of an<br>
MH ensemble through which MH services are transmitted. The MH services will be<br>
described in more detail in a later process. Herein, the ensemble_id field binds the MH<br>
services and the MH ensemble.<br>
[ 197] The SI_version field is a 4-bit field indicating version information of SI data<br>
included in the corresponding ensemble, which is being transmitted within the RS<br>
frame.<br>
[198] Finally, the num_channel field is an 8-bit field indicating the number of virtual<br>
channel being transmitted via the corresponding ensemble.<br>
[199] A third region of the FIC segment payload a channel loop region, which includes a<br>
channel_type field, a channel_activity field, a CA_indicator field, a<br>
stand_alone_service_indicator field, a major_channel_num field, and a<br>
minor_channel_num field.<br>
[200] The channel_type field is a 5-bit field indicating a service type of the corresponding<br>
virtual channel. For example, the channel_type field may indicates an audio/video<br>
channel, an audio/video and data channel, an audio-only channel, a data-only channel,<br>
a file download channel, an ESG delivery channel, a notification channel, and so on.<br>
[201] The channel_activity field is a 2-bit field indicating activity information of the cor-<br>
responding virtual channel. More specifically, the channel_activity field may indicate<br>
whether the current virtual channel is providing the current service.<br>
[202] The CA_indicator field is a 1-bit field indicating whether or not a conditional access<br>
(CA) is applied to the current virtual channel.<br>
[203] The stand_alone_service_indicator field is also a 1-bit field, which indicates whether<br>
the service of the corresponding virtual channel corresponds to a stand alone service.<br>
[204] The major_channel_num field is an 8-bit field indicating a major channel number of<br>
the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[205]	Finally, the minor_channel_num field is also an 8-bit field indicating a minor<br>
channel number of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
 <br>
[206]<br>
[207] Service Table Map<br>
[208] FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of a service map table<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "SMT") according to the present invention.<br>
[209] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is configured in an<br>
MPEG-2 private section format. However, this will not limit the scope and spirit of the<br>
present invention. The SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes description information for each virtual channel within a single MH ensemble.<br>
And, additional information may further be included in each descriptor area.<br>
[210] Herein, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention includes at<br>
least one field and is transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system.<br>
[211] As described in FIG. 3, the SMT section may be transmitted by being included in the<br>
MH TP within the RS frame. In this case, each of the RS frame decoders 170 and 180,<br>
shown in FIG. 1, decodes the inputted RS frame, respectively. Then, each of the<br>
decoded RS frames is outputted to the respective RS frame handler 211 and 212.<br>
Thereafter, each RS frame handler 211 and 212 identifies the inputted RS frame by<br>
row units, so as to create an MH TP, thereby outputting the created MH TP to the MH<br>
TP handler 213.<br>
[212] When it is determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an SMT section based<br>
upon the header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP handler 213 parses the cor-<br>
responding SMT section, so as to output the SI data within the parsed SMT section to<br>
the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. However, this is limited to when the<br>
SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams.<br>
[213] Meanwhile, when the SMT is encapsulated to IP datagrams, and when it is<br>
determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an SMT section based upon the<br>
header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP handler 213 outputs the SMT<br>
section to the IP network stack 220. Accordingly, the IP network stack 220 performs IP<br>
and UDP processes on the inputted SMT section and, then, outputs the processed SMT<br>
section to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 240 parses the inputted SMT section and<br>
controls the system so that the parsed SI data can be stored in the storage unit 290.<br>
[214] The following corresponds to example of the fields that may be transmitted through<br>
the SMT.<br>
[215] A table_id field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer number, which indicates the<br>
type of table section. The table_id field allows the corresponding table to be defined as<br>
the service map table (SMT).<br>
[216]	An ensemble_id field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field, which corresponds to an ID<br>
value associated to the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the ensemble_id field<br>
may be assigned with a value ranging from range "0x00" to '0x3F'. It is preferable that<br>
 <br>
the value of the ensemble_id field is derived from the parade_id of the TPC data,<br>
which is carried from the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem. When<br>
the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted through (or carried over) the primary<br>
RS frame, a value of '0' may be used for the most significant bit (MSB), and the<br>
remaining 7 bits are used as the parade_id value of the associated MH parade (i.e., for<br>
the least significant 7 bits). Alternatively, when the corresponding MH ensemble is<br>
transmitted through (or carried over) the secondary RS frame, a value of '1' may be<br>
used for the most significant bit (MSB).<br>
[217] A num_channels field is an 8-bit field, which specifies the number of virtual<br>
channels in the corresponding SMT section.<br>
[218] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention provides<br>
information on a plurality of virtual channels using the 'for' loop statement.<br>
[219] A major_channel_num field corresponds to an 8-bit field, which represents the major<br>
channel number associated with the corresponding virtual channel. Herein, the<br>
major_channel_num field may be assigned with a value ranging from '0x00' to<br>
'OxFF'.<br>
[220] A minor_channel_num field corresponds to an 8-bit field, which represents the minor<br>
channel number associated with the corresponding virtual channel. Herein, the<br>
minor_channel_num field may be assigned with a value ranging from '0x00' to<br>
'OxFF'.<br>
[221] A short_channel_name field indicates the short name of the virtual channel. The<br>
service_id field is a 16-bit unsigned integer number (or value), which identifies the<br>
virtual channel service.<br>
[222] A service_type field is a 6-bit enumerated type field, which designates the type of<br>
service carried in the corresponding virtual channel as defined in Table 2 below.<br>
[223] Table 2<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[224] A virtual_channel_activity field is a 2-bit enumerated field identifying the activity<br>
status of the corresponding virtual channel. When the most significant bit (MSB) of the<br>
virtual_channel_activity field is '1', the virtual channel is active, and when the most<br>
significant bit (MSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is<br>
inactive. Also, when the least significant bit (LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field<br>
is '1', the virtual channel is hidden (when set to 1), and when the least significant bit<br>
(LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is not hidden.<br>
[225] A num_components field is a 5-bit field, which specifies the number of IP stream<br>
components in the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[226] An IP_version_flag field corresponds to a 1 -bit indicator. More specifically, when<br>
the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to '1', this indicates that a source<br>
_IP_address field, a virtual_channel_target_IP_address field, and a<br>
component_target_IP_address field are IPv6 addresses. Alternatively, when the value<br>
of the IP_version_flag field is set to '0', this indicates that the source_IP_address field,<br>
the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field, and the component_target_fP_address<br>
field are IPv4.<br>
[227] A source_rP_address_fIag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates, when set,<br>
that a source IP address of the corresponding virtual channel exist for a specific<br>
multicast source.<br>
[228| A virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which<br>
indicates, when set. that the corresponding IP stream component is delivered through<br>
 <br>
IP datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Therefore, when the flag is set, the receiving<br>
. system (or receiver) uses the component_target_IP_address as the target_IP_address in<br>
order to access the corresponding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may ignore the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field included<br>
in the num_channels loop.<br>
[229] The source_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field. Herein, the<br>
source_IP_address field will be significant (or present), when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '1'. However, when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '0', the source_IP_address field will become in-<br>
significant (or absent). More specifically, when the source_IP_address_flag field value<br>
is set to '1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
source_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit IPv4 address, which shows the source of the<br>
corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the IP_version_flag field value is<br>
set to T, the source_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit IPv6 address, which shows<br>
the source of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[230] The virtual_channel_target_IP_address field also corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit<br>
field. Herein, the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will be significant (or<br>
present), when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set to<br>
' 1'. However, when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set<br>
to '0', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will become insignificant (or<br>
absent). More specifically, when the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field<br>
value is set to '1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address<br>
associated to the corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field value is set to '1', and when the<br>
IP_version_flag field value is set to '1', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field<br>
indicates a 64-bit target IPv6 address associated to the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
If the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field is insignificant (or absent), the<br>
component_target_IP_address field within the num_channels loop should become<br>
significant (or present). And, in order to enable the receiving system to access the IP<br>
stream component, the component_target_IP_address field should be used.<br>
[231 ] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention uses a<br>
'for' loop statement in order to provide information on a plurality of components.<br>
[232] Herein, an RTP_payload_type field, which is assigned with 7 bits, identifies the<br>
encoding format of the component based upon Table 3 shown below. When the IP<br>
stream component is not encapsulated to RTP. the RTP_payload__type field shall be<br>
ignored (or deprecated).<br>
 <br>
[233] Table 3 below shows an example of the RTP_payload_type.<br>
[234] Table 3<br>
 <br>
[235] A component_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates,<br>
when set, that the corresponding IP stream component is delivered through IP<br>
datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Furthermore, when the<br>
component_target_IP_address_flag is set, the receiving system (or receiver) uses the<br>
component_target_IP_address field as the target IP address for accessing the cor-<br>
responding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) will<br>
ignore the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field included in the num_channels loop.<br>
[236] The component_target_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field.<br>
Herein, when the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to '0', the<br>
component_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address associated to<br>
the corresponding IP stream component. And, when the value of the IP_version_flag<br>
field is set to '1', the component_target_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit target<br>
IPv6 address associated to the corresponding IP stream component.<br>
[237] A port_num_count field is a 6-bit field, which indicates the number of UDP ports<br>
associated with the corresponding IP stream component. A target UDP port number<br>
value starts from the target_UDP_port_num field value and increases (or is in-<br>
cremented) by 1. For the RTP stream, the target UDP port number should start from<br>
the target_UDP_port_num field value and shall increase (or be incremented) by 2. This<br>
is to incorporate RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams.<br>
[238] A target_UDP_port_num field is a 16-bit unsigned integer field, which represents the<br>
target UDP port number for the corresponding IP stream component. When used for<br>
RTP streams, the value of the target_UDP_port_num field shall correspond to an even<br>
number. And, the next higher value shall represent the target UDP port number of the<br>
associated RTCP stream.<br>
[239] A component_level_descriptoi-() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
additional information on the corresponding IP stream component.<br>
[240] A virtual_channel_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
 <br>
additional information for the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[241] An ensemble_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing<br>
additional information for the MH ensemble, which is described by the corresponding<br>
SMT.<br>
[242] FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH audio<br>
descriptor according to the present invention.<br>
[243] When at least one audio service is present as a component of the current event, the<br>
MH_audio_descriptor() shall be used as a componerit_level_descriptor of the SMT.<br>
The MH_audio_descriptor() may be capable of informing the system of the audio<br>
language type and stereo mode status. If there is no audio service associated with the<br>
current event, then it is preferable that the MH_audio_descriptor() is considered to be<br>
insignificant (or absent) for the current event.<br>
[244] Each field shown in the bit stream syntax of FIG. 18 will now be described in detail.<br>
[245] A descriptor_tag field is an 8-bit unsigned integer having a TBD value, which<br>
indicates that the corresponding descriptor is the MH_audio_descriptor().<br>

(in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptor_length field up to the<br>
end of the MH_audio_descriptor().<br>

and configuration of audio channels. The values ranging from '1' to '6' respectively<br>
indicate the number and configuration of audio channels as given for "Default bit<br>
stream index number" in Table 42 of ISO/IEC 13818-7:2006. All other values indicate<br>
that the number and configuration of audio channels are undefined.<br>
[248] A sample_rate_code field is a 3-bit field, which indicates the sample rate of the<br>
encoded audio data. Herein, the indication may correspond to one specific sample rate,<br>
or may correspond to a set of values that include the sample rate of the encoded audio<br>
data as defined in Table A3.3 of ATSC A/52B.<br>
[249] A bit_rate_code field corresponds to a 6-bit field. Herein, among the 6 bits, the lower<br>
5 bits indicate a nominal bit rate. More specifically, when the most significant bit<br>
(MSB) is '0', the corresponding bit rate is exact. On the other hand, when the most<br>
significant bit (MSB) is '0', the bit rate corresponds to an upper limit as defined in<br>
Table A3.4 of ATSC A/53B.<br>
[250] An lSO_639_language_code field is a 24-bit (i.e., 3-byte) field indicating the<br>
language used for the audio stream component, in conformance with ISO 639.2/B [x].<br>
When a specific language is not present in the corresponding audio stream component,<br>
the value of each byte will be set to '0x00'.<br>

MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() exists only when the dynamic value of the<br>
RTP_payload_type field within the num_components loop of the SMT is in the range<br>
of '96' to '127'. The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() is used as a<br>
component_level_descriptor of the SMT.<br>
[253] The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor translates (or matches) a dynamic<br>
RTP_payload_type field value into (or with) a MIME type. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may collect (or gather) the encoding format of the IP stream<br>
component, which is encapsulated in RTP.<br>

virtual_channel_level_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>

the start time, duration, and title of the current event, etc.), which is transmitted via the<br>
respective virtual channel.<br>
[262] The fields included in the MH__current_event_descriptor() will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[263] A descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_current_event_descriptor().<br>
[264]	A descriptor_lcngth field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptor_length field up to the end of the MH_current_cvent_descriptor().<br>
 <br>
[265] A current_event_start_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity.<br>
The current_event_start_time field represents the start time of the current event and,<br>
more specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6,<br>
1980.<br>
[266] A current_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
current_event_duration field indicates the duration of the current event in hours,<br>
minutes, and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD = 24 bits).<br>
[267] A title_length field specifies the length (in bytes) of a title_text field. Herein, the<br>
value '0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the corresponding event.<br>
[268] The title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the<br>
format of a multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [x].<br>
[269] FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH next event<br>
descriptor according to the present invention.<br>
[270] The optional MH_next_event_descriptor() shall be used as the<br>
virtual_channel_level_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_next_event_descriptor() provides basic information on the next event (e.g., the<br>
start time, duration, and title of the next event, etc.), which is transmitted via the<br>
respective virtual channel.<br>
[271] The fields included in the MH_next_event_descriptor() will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[272] A descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_next_event_descriptor().<br>
[273] A descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptor_length field up to the end of the MH_next_event_descriptor().<br>
[274] A next_event_start_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The<br>
next_event_start_time field represents the start time of the next event and, more<br>
specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6, 1980.<br>
[275] A next_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
next_event_duration field indicates the duration of the next event in hours, minutes,<br>
and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD = 24 bits).<br>
[276] A titlejength field specifies the length (in bytes) of a title_text field. Herein, the<br>
value '0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the corresponding event.<br>
[277] The title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the<br>

[278] FIG. 22 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH system time<br>
descriptor according to the present invention.<br>
[279] The MH_system_time_dcscriptor() shall be used as the ensemble_level_descriptor()<br>
 <br>
within the SMT. Herein, the MH_system_time_descriptor() provides information on<br>
current time and date. The MH_system_time_descriptor() also provides information on<br>
the time zone in which the transmitting system (or transmitter) transmitting the c or-<br>
responding broadcast stream is located, while taking into consideration the mobile/<br>
portable characteristics of the MH service data.<br>
[280] The fields included in the MH_system_time_descriptor() will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[281] A descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_system_time_descriptor().<br>
[282] A descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descr<br>
iptor_length field up to the end of the MH_system_time_descriptor().<br>
[283] A system_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The<br>
system_time field represents the current system time and, more specifically, as the<br>
number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6, 1980.<br>
[284] A GPS_UTC_offset field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which defines the<br>
current offset in whole seconds between GPS and UTC time standards. In order to<br>
convert GPS time to UTC time, the GPS_UTC_offset is subtracted from GPS time.<br>
Whenever the International Bureau of Weights and Measures decides that the current<br>
offset is too far in error, an additional leap second may be added (or subtracted). Ac-<br>
cordingly, the GPS_UTC_offset field value will reflect the change.<br>
[285] A time_zone_offset_polarity field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether the time of<br>
the time zone, in which the broadcast station is located, exceeds (or leads or is faster)<br>
or falls behind (or lags or is slower) than the UTC time. When the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '0', this indicates that the time on the<br>
current time zone exceeds the UTC time. Therefore, a time_zone_offset field value is<br>
added to the UTC time value. Conversely, when the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '1', this indicates that the time on the<br>
current time zone falls behind the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset field<br>
value is subtracted from the UTC time value.<br>
[286] The time_zone_offset field is a 31-bit unsigned integer quantity. More specifically,<br>
the time_zone_offset field represents, in GPS seconds, the time offset of the time zone<br>
in which the broadcast station is located, when compared to the UTC time.<br>
[287] A daylight_savings field corresponds to a 16-bit field providing information on the<br>
Summer Time (i.e., the Daylight Savings Time).<br>

stream is located.<br>
 <br>
[289] FIG. 23 illustrates segmentation and encapsulation processes of a service map table<br>
(SMT) according to the present invention.<br>
[290] According to the present invention, the SMT is encapsulated to UDP, while including<br>
a target IP address and a target UDP port number within the IP datagram. More<br>
specifically, the SMT is first segmented into a predetermined number of sections, then<br>
encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally encapsulated to an IP header.<br>
[291] In addition, the SMT section provides signaling information on all virtual channel<br>
included in the MH ensemble including the corresponding SMT section. At least one<br>
SMT section describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the<br>
corresponding MH ensemble. Finally, each SMT section is identified by an<br>
ensemble_id included in each section.<br>
[292] According to the embodiment of the present invention, by informing the receiving<br>
system of the target IP address and target UDP port number, the corresponding data<br>
(i.e., target IP address and target UDP port number) may be parsed without having the<br>
receiving system to request for other additional information.<br>
[293] FIG. 24 illustrates a flow chart for accessing a virtual channel using FIC and SMT<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[294] More specifically, a physical channel is tuned (S501). And, when it is determined<br>
that an MH signal exists in the tuned physical channel (S502), the corresponding MH<br>
signal is demodulated (S503). Additionally, FIC segments are grouped from the de-<br>
modulated MH signal in sub-frame units (S504 and S505).<br>
[295] According to the embodiment of the present invention, an FIC segment is inserted in<br>
a data group, so as to be transmitted. More specifically, the FIC segment corresponding<br>
to each data group described service information on the MH ensemble to which the<br>
corresponding data group belongs. When the FIC segments are grouped in sub-frame<br>
units and, then, deinterleaved, all service information on the physical channel through<br>
which the corresponding FIC segment is transmitted may be acquired. Therefore, after<br>
the tuning process, the receiving system may acquire channel information on the cor-<br>
responding physical channel during a sub-frame period. Once the FIC segments are<br>
grouped, in S504 and S505, a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC<br>
segment is being transmitted is identified (S506). For example, the broadcast stream<br>
may be identified by parsing the transport_stream_id field of the FTC body, which is<br>
configured by grouping the FIC segments.<br>
[296] Furthermore, an ensemble identifier, a major channel number, a minor channel<br>
number, channel type information, and so on, are extracted from the FIC body (S507).<br>
And, by using the extracted ensemble information, only the slots corresponding to the<br>
designated ensemble are acquired by using the time-slicing method, so as to configure<br>
an ensemble (S508).<br>
 <br>
[297] Subsequently, the RS frame corresponding to the designated ensemble is decoded<br>
(S509), and an IP socket is opened for SMT reception (S510).<br>
[298] According to the example given in the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
SMT is encapsulated to UDP, while including a target IP address and a target UDP<br>
port number within the IP datagram. More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into<br>
a predetermined number of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally<br>
encapsulated to an IP header. According to the embodiment of the present invention,<br>
by informing the receiving system of the target IP address and target UDP port<br>
number, the receiving system parses the SMT sections and the descriptors of each<br>
SMT section without requesting for other additional information (S511).<br>
[299] The SMT section provides signaling information on all virtual channel included in<br>
the MH ensemble including the corresponding SMT section. At least one SMT section<br>
describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the cor-<br>
responding MH ensemble. Also, each SMT section is identified by an ensemble_id<br>
included in each section.<br>
[300] Furthermore each SMT provides IP access information on each virtual channel<br>
subordinate to the corresponding MH ensemble including each SMT. Finally, the SMT<br>
provides IP stream component level information required for the servicing of the cor-<br>
responding virtual channel.<br>
[301] Therefore, by using the information parsed from the SMT, the IP stream component<br>
belonging to the virtual channel requested for reception may be accessed (S513). Ac-<br>
cordingly, the service associated with the corresponding virtual channel is provided to<br>
the user (S514).<br>
[302] Meanwhile, the present invention enables signaling tables describing signaling in-<br>
formation required for a service access using the IP signaling channel to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[303] More specifically, an IP stream having a well-known IP address and a well-known<br>
port number is assigned to an ensemble. In the description of the present invention, this<br>
will be referred to as the IP signaling channel.<br>
[304] The IP signaling channel transmits at least one signaling table. According to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, at least one signaling table, such as a service map<br>
table (SMT), a system time table (STT), a rating region table (RRT), a guide access<br>
table (GAT), future event table (FET), and a cell information table (CIT), is<br>
transmitted through the IP signaling channel. Herein, the signaling tables presented in<br>
the embodiment of the present invention are merely examples for facilitating the un-<br>
derstanding of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not limited<br>
only to the exemplary signaling tables that can be transmitted through the IP signaling<br>
channel.<br>
 <br>
[305] The SMT provides signaling information on ensemble levels. Also, each SMT<br>
provides IP access information for each virtual channel belonging to the corresponding<br>
ensemble including each SMT. Furthermore, the SMT provides IP stream component<br>
level information required for services of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[306] The STT transmits information on the current data and timing information.<br>
Meanwhile, when the digital broadcast receiving system is used in mobile conditions<br>
and in extended regions, such as North America, the position of the receiving system<br>
may deviate outside of the time zone. The STT may be used to notify such deviation.<br>
[307] The RRT transmits information on region and consultation organs for program<br>
ratings. More specifically, the RRT provides content advisory rating information.<br>
[308] The GAT provides service guide (SG) acquisition information. And, the GAT<br>
provides information of SG providers transmitting SGs through the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble transmitting the GAT.<br>
[309] The FET provides information associated with an event for a future usage. More<br>
specifically, the FET is optional and provides information on future event transmitted<br>
through virtual channel included in the corresponding MH ensemble transmitting the<br>
FET.<br>
[310] The CIT provides channel information of each cell, which corresponds to the<br>
frequency domain of a broadcast signal. Herein, a cell refers to a scope affected (or<br>
influenced) by a transmitter based upon a physical frequency in a multi-frequency<br>
network (MFN) environment (or condition). More specifically, the CIT provides in-<br>
formation on a carrier wave frequency of an adjacent cell in the current transmitter (or<br>
transmitting system). Therefore, based upon the CIT information, a receiver (or<br>
receiving system) can travel from one transmitter's (or exciter's) coverage area to<br>
another.<br>
[311] The present invention encapsulates each signaling table to a UDP header and en-<br>
capsulates the UDP-encapsulated signaling table to an IP header. Therefore, the<br>
processed signaling table may be transmitted through the IP signaling channel. In this<br>
case, a number of UDP/IP packets corresponding to the number of signaling tables<br>
transmitted through the IP signaling channel are also transmitted through the IP<br>
signaling channel.<br>
[312] Also, the present invention identifies (or distinguishes) each signaling table to at least<br>
one transmission unit. Thereafter, each transmission unit is encapsulated to a UDP<br>
header and then encapsulated to an IP header, thereby being transmitted through the IP<br>
signaling channel.<br>
[313]	Herein, the transmission unit may correspond to a section. And, a single signaling<br>
table may be divided into a plurality of section, wherein each section may be used as<br>
the transmission unit.<br>
 <br>
[314] According to an embodiment of the present invention, each signaling table is divided<br>
into at least one section. Then, each section is encapsulated to a UDP/IP header,<br>
thereby being transmitted through the IP signaling channel. In this case, the number of<br>
UDP/IP packets being transmitted through the IP signaling channel may vary based<br>
upon the number of signaling tables being transmitted through the IP signaling channel<br>
and the number of sections in each signaling table. At this point, all UDP/IP packets<br>
transmitted through the IP signaling channel have the same number of well-known<br>
target IP addresses and well-known target UDP port numbers. For example, when it is<br>
assumed that the SMT, RRT, and STT are transmitted through the IP signaling<br>
channel, the target IP address and target UDP port number of all UDP/IP packets<br>
transmitting the SMT, RRT, and STT are identical to one another. Furthermore, the<br>
target IP address and the target UDP port number respectively correspond to well-<br>
known values, i.e., values pre-known by the receiving system based upon an agreement<br>
between the receiving system and the transmitting system. Therefore, each signaling<br>
table received through the IP signaling channel is distinguished (or identified) by a<br>
table identifier (e.g., table_id, table_id_extension).<br>
[315] The IP signaling channel may be assigned (or allocated) to at least one MH TP<br>
within an RS frame corresponding to the respective ensemble. More specifically, based<br>
upon the amount of data being transmitted through the IP signaling channel, each<br>
signaling table may either be assigned to a single MH TP and then transmitted, or be<br>
assigned to a plurality of MH TP and then transmitted. Additionally, the IP signaling<br>
channel may be transmitted through at least one of a primary RS frame and a<br>
secondary RS frame. Herein, the RS frame may be divided into a primary RS frame<br>
and a secondary RS frame. In this case, the primary RS frame and the secondary RS<br>
frame may be divided based upon the level of importance of the corresponding data.<br>
[316] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the RS frame being assigned<br>
to regions A/B within the corresponding data group will be referred to as a "primary<br>
RS frame", and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the corresponding<br>
data group will be referred to as a "secondary RS frame". Also, one ensemble<br>
corresponds to one RS frame. More specifically, a primary ensemble corresponds to<br>
the primary RS frame, and a secondary ensemble corresponds to the secondary RS<br>
frame. Therefore, based upon the level of importance of the corresponding signaling<br>
table, the IP signaling channel according to the embodiment of the present invention<br>
may be assigned to the primary RS frame only, to the secondary RS frame only, or to<br>
both primary and secondary RS frames.<br>

transmitting system is located. The STT section may further include a descriptor<br>
describing additional information associated with the STT.<br>

signaling tables transmitted to the IP signaling channel according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 27, an identifier identifying the RRT may be set as the<br>

rating_region_name_text() field that follows. The rating_region_name_text() field<br>
indicates, in a multiple string structure, a rating region name of a broadcast program.<br>
The dimensions_defined field signifies the number of dimensions defined in the<br>
current RRT section. The dimension_name_length field indicates the total length of the<br>
dimension_name_text() field that follows. The dimension_name_text() field indicates,<br>
in a multiple string structure, a dimension name described in a loop statement. The<br>

graduated scale having a changed rating value.<br>

follows. The rating_value_text() field indicates the full name of a specific rating value<br>
in a multiple string structure. The RRT section may further include a descriptor<br>
describing additional information associated with the RRT.<br>

signaling tables transmitted to the IP signaling channel according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 28. an identifier identifying the CIT may be set as the<br>

[329] FIG. 30 illustrates an exemplary syntax structure of an FET section among multiple<br>
signaling tables transmitted to the IP signaling channel according to the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 30, an identifier identifying the FET may be set as the<br>
table_id field, which corresponds to the table identifier. Herein, the FET of FIG. 30<br>
assigns an 8-bit ensemble_id field and an 8-bit FET_protocol_version field to the<br>
position of the table_id_extension field, so that the newly assigned fields may be used<br>

ensemble_id field is derived from the parade_id of the TPC data, which is carried from<br>
the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem. When the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble is transmitted through (or carried over) the primary RS frame, a value of "0"<br>
may be used for the most significant bit (MSB), and the remaining 7 bits are used as<br>
 <br>
the parade_id value of the associated MH parade (i.e., for the least significant 7 bits).<br>
Alternatively, when the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted through (or carried<br>
over) the secondary RS frame, a value of '1' may be used for the most significant bit<br>
(MSB), and the remaining 7 bits are used as the parade_id value of the associated MH<br>

[332] As described above, when not only the table_id field but also table_id_extension<br>
field are used as table identifiers for identifying the signaling tables, each signaling<br>
table may further include the table_id_extension field. Herein, the table_id_extension<br>
field may be assigned with 16 bits. And, it is preferable that the table_id_extension<br>
field is positioned after the section_length field in each signaling table. In this case, the<br>
value of the table_id_extension field may indicate an ensemble identifier (i.e., an 8-bit<br>
ensemble_id field) and a protocol version (i.e., an 8-bit protocol_version field) of each<br>
signaling table, as shown in FIG. 29 and FIG. 30.<br>
[333J Hereinafter, a process of receiving and accessing an IP signaling channel according<br>
to the present invention will be described in detail. More specifically, in the digital<br>
broadcast receiving system of FIG. 1, each of the RS frame decoders 170 and 180 re-<br>
spectively decodes the inputted RS frames. Then, the decoded RS frames are outputted<br>
to the respective RS frame handlers 211 and 212. Subsequently, each RS frame handler<br>
211 and 212 divides the inputted RS frame in row units so as to configure an MH TP,<br>
respectively. Thereafter, the MH TPs are outputted to the MH-TP handler 213. The<br>
MH-TP handler 213 extracts a header from each MH TP received from the RS frame<br>
 <br>
handlers 211 and 212, respectively. Then, the MH-TP handler 213 determines the data<br>
included in the corresponding MH TP. Accordingly, if the determined data correspond<br>
to an IP datagram, the corresponding data are outputted to the IP network stack 220.<br>
[334] At this point, since the IP signaling channel includes a well-known target IP address<br>
and a well-known target UDP port number, the IP network stack 220 is already<br>
informed of the target IP address and target UDP port number of the IP signaling<br>
channel. Therefore, the IP network stack 220 accesses the IP signaling channel without<br>
requesting for any separate information, thereby collecting IP datagrams that are<br>
received through the IP signaling channel. Then, the IP network stack 220 removes IP<br>
headers and UDP headers from the collected IP datagrams and, then, outputs the<br>
processed IP datagrams to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 240 may use table<br>
identifiers to distinguish (or identify) each signaling table or each signaling table<br>
section. Also, the SI handler 240 collects sections having the same table identifier so as<br>
to complete the corresponding signaling table. Thereafter, the SI handler 240 parses the<br>
completed signaling table and stores the processed result to the storage unit 290.<br>
Herein, the SI handler 240 may either perform the parsing process in signaling table<br>
units, or perform the parsing process in signaling table section units.<br>
[335] FIG. 31 illustrates a flow chart showing an IP signaling processing method according<br>
to the present invention. More specifically, the IP network stack 220 opens an IP<br>
socket in order to receive the IP signaling channel (S701). According to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of signaling tables transmitted through<br>
the IP signaling channel, the tables each carrying a target IP address and a target UDP<br>
port number on an IP datagram, is encapsulated to IP/UDP. At this point, each UDP/IP<br>
packet being transmitted to the IP signaling channel has the same well-known target IP<br>
address and well-known target UDP port number. For example, when it is assumed<br>
that the SMT, RRT, and STT are transmitted through the IP signaling channel, all<br>
UDP/IP packets respectively transmitting the SMT, RRT, and STT have the same<br>
target IP address and target UDP port number. Also, each of the target IP address and<br>
target UDP port number is respectively assigned with a well-known value (i.e., a value<br>
pre-known by the digital broadcast receiving system based upon an agreement between<br>
the receiving system and the transmitting system).<br>
[336] When IP socket is open in step 701, TP datagrams transmitted through the IP<br>
signaling channel are collected (S702). At this point, since the IP signaling channel<br>
includes a well-known target IP address and a well-known target UDP port number,<br>
the IP network stack 220 is already informed of the target IP address and target UDP<br>
port number of the IP signaling channel. Therefore, the IP network stack 220 accesses<br>
the IP signaling channel without requesting for any separate information, thereby<br>
collecting IP datagrams (i.e.. signaling table information) that are received through the<br>
 <br>
IP signaling channel. Subsequently, by identifying the collected signaling table in-<br>
formation using each table identifier, each signaling table or each signaling table<br>
section is recovered (S703). Thereafter, each of the recovered signaling tables or<br>
signaling table sections is parsed. And, the parsed result is either stored in the storage<br>
unit 290 or outputted to the block requiring the parsed result (S704).<br>
[337] As described above, the digital broadcasting system and the data processing method<br>
according to the present invention have the following advantages. The present<br>
invention assigns an IP signaling channel having a well-known target IP address and a<br>
well-known target UDP port number to each ensemble. Then, the present invention<br>
transmits a signaling table describing information required for service access through<br>
the IP signaling channel. Therefore, after configuring the ensembles, the digital<br>
broadcast receiving system according to the present invention opens an IP socket for<br>
an IP stream having the corresponding well-known target IP address and well-known<br>
target UDP port number. More specifically, the digital broadcast receiving system may<br>
access the IP signaling channel without requesting for any separate information.<br>
Furthermore, by using a table identifier included in a header of each signaling table,<br>
the digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention can find (or<br>
locate) a desired signaling table from the corresponding IP stream.<br>
[338] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations<br>
can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and<br>
variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>
