				<td>Field of the invention:<br><br>
The present invention relates to improved processes for the preparation of Montelukast and its salts thereof.<br><br>
Background of the invention:<br><br>
Montelukast sodium namely Sodium 1-[[[(lR)-1-[3-[(lE)-2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl] phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1 -methylethyl) phenyl] propyl] thio] methyl] cyclo propane acetic acid has the formula<br><br>
Montelukast sodium is a leukotriene antagonist and inhibits the synthesis of leukotriene biosynthesis. It is useflul as anti-asthmatic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective agent and hence useful in the treatment of angina, cerebral spasm, glomerular nephritis, hepatic, end toxemia, uveitis and allograft rejection.<br><br>
EF 0 480 717 discloses Montelukast sodium along with other related compounds and the methods for their preparation. The reported method of synthesis proceeds though corresponding methyl ester namely, and involves coupling methyl 1 -(mercaptomethyl) cyclopropane acetate with a mesylate generated in-situ. The methyl ester is hydrolyzed to free acids and the latter converted directly to Montelukast sodium salt. The process is not suitable for large-scale production because it requires tedious chromatographic purification of the methyl ester intermediate and br the final product with low yield.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No.5,614,632 discloses a process for the preparation of the sodium salt of montelukast and certain process intermediates. The process involves generation of dilithium dianion of 1- (mercaptomethyl) cyclopropaneacetic acid followed by condensation with 2-(2-(3 (S)-(3-(2-(7- chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl) phenyl)-3-methanesulfonyloxypropyl) phenyl)-2-propanol (referred as mesylated alcohol) to afford montelukast, which is further converted to the corresponding sodium salt via dicyclohexyl amine salt. The ‘362 patent also discloses a process for the preparation of crystalline montelukast sodium salt and mesylated alcohol. The process involves reacting methyl 2(3 (S)-(3-(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl) phenyl)-3-hydroxy propyl) benzoate with methyl magnesium chloride to give a diol, which is further converted to mesylated alcohol on reaction with methane suffonyl chloride. While certain processes of its preparation are known, there is a continuing need for new processes of preparation of montelukast and its salts. It is mentioned by the inventors of patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,632, that the crystalline montelukast dicyclohexylantine salt offers an efficient method for the purification of montelukast, which circumvents the need to use chromatographic purification.<br><br>
Processes for preparation of montelukast and its intermediates have also been described in U.S. Patent No’s. 5,523,477, and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0234241,<br>
2005/0256156, 2005/0107612, and International Application PublicationNos. WO 2005/105749,WO 2005/000807, WO 2004/108679, and WO 2006/021974.<br><br>
WO 2006/08751 discloses a process for preparation of Montelukast sodium by neutralizing Montelukast organic amine salts such as [alpha}-Methyl benzyl amine salt, diisopropyl amine salt, dibenzyl amine salt followed by treatment with ethanolic sodium hydroxide.<br><br>
Although many processes have been described in the prior art for the preparation of montelukast and its intermediates, there still remains a need for a process for the preparation of montelukast which is industrially viable.<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Montelukast and its salts thereof.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide novel amine salts of Montelukast.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel amine salts of Montelukast.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Montelukast alkali/alkaline salts using nine salts of Montelukast.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Montelukast alkalilalkaline salts without isolating Montelukast free acid.<br><br>

The present invention is best described with the following synthetic scheme-1;<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention the main object is to prepare montelukast and salts thereof comprising the steps of:<br><br>
a.	Treating 2-[2-[3(S)-[3-[2-(7-Chloro-2-quniolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-hydroxypropyl] phenyl]-2-propanol with acetic anhydride yields (S)-l-(3-((E)-2-(7-chloroquinolin-2-yl) vinyl) phenyl)-3-(2-isopropenyl phenyl] propyl acetate<br><br>
b.	Converting (S)-l-(3-((E)-2-(7-chloroquinolin-2-yl) vinyl) phenyl)-3-(2-isopropenyl phenyl] propyl acetate to (S)-l-(3-((E)-2-(7-chloroquinolin-2-yl) vinyl) phenyl)-3-(2-isopropenyl phenyl] propan-1-ol (hydroxy styrene)<br><br>

g) converting the amine salt into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts by generating the montelukast free acid from montelukast amine salt in halogenated solvents, for example, chloroform, dichloromethane or dichloroethane, preferably, dichloromethane, or an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene in the presence of an organic acid, preferably acetic acid;<br><br>
h) converting the obtained solution in step (g) to sodium salt of Montelukast using sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide in alcohols such as from methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, 2-propanol or tert.butanol, preferably, by using ethanolic sodium hydroxide;<br><br>
i) distilling the solvent from the reaction solution of step (g) under reduced pressure and; <br><br>
j) dissolving the above residue in methanol and treating with activated carbon<br><br>
k) distilling methanol completely and isolating the desired product by adding cyclohexane, npentane, n-heptane or hexanes; and<br><br>
l) drying the isolated solid at 50-95°C. under vacuum.<br><br>
The Montelukast sodium obtained in the present novel process is having &gt;99.0% enantiomeric excess purity and resulted in amorphous form.
