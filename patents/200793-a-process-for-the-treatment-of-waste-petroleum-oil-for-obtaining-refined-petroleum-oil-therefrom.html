				<td>This invention retates to a process for the treatment of waste petroleum oil for obtaining refined petroleum oil therefrom.<br>
Waste petroleum oil, such as, waste subricating oil and other contaminated or degraded petroleum oil waste is classified as hazardous waste all over the world and has the potential to pollute water supply and soil, causing pollution to drinking water as wel1 as threat to msirine life and I and vegetation.<br>
Waste oil comprises hydrocarbons having a commercial use if It can be treated to restore its commercial qualities .<br>
Presently, in India, waste oil treatment is done by  a process called acid clay treatment.<br>
Thi s process involves the dehydration of the waste oil by distilling the water therefrom in a dehydrator; the dehydrated oil is heated and then cooled to ambient temperature (this step is called thermal cracking); the waste oil from the thermal cracker is then mixed with  sulphuric acid<br><br>
and left for settling. The acid sludge is decanted and disposed of. The clear oil is transferred to the clay treatment section.<br>
In the clay treatment section, the oil is mixed with activated alumina clay and the mixture is heated and subjected to distillation under vacuum. The oil clay mixture is filtered in a press and the clear oil is now sent for commercial use.<br>
The	effluent  in the above known  procees,  apart<br>
from	water,  are the acid sludge (around 20%      to<br>
50 %	of  the waste oils processed) and  spent  clay,<br>
the	quantity of which is also  substantial.   The<br>
life	of the plant used in this process is low  due<br>
to	heavy   corroeion  by  the   use   of   acid.<br>
Additionally,  the plant emits flue gas and  other<br>
gases including SO<br><br>
Another known process does not use sulphuric acid.<br>
The  waste  oil  is  treated  with  chemicals   to<br>
coagulate  the degraded additives: carbon,  s1udge<br>
and other impurities. These are filtered out   and<br>
the  remaining oil is then eubiected to  act i vated<br>
alumina  clay treatment and  vacuum  distillation.<br><br>
In this process, the use of chemicals will essentially generate solid waste which will be d i ff icult. to d i spose of. The actual separation of undesirable, degraded or other foreign matters is done by the uss of chemicalE, absorbent or adsorbent. The eff1uont f rom the process are water, coagulant along with carbon, spent additives, sludge and other impurities, and spent clay in addition to emissions of flue and process gases. A major drawback with this process is the high cost of operation of the plant.<br>
The equipment used in the above two processes are distillation columns with standard types of trays such as bubb1e-cap trays, si eve trays, valve trays etc. or packed column. The use of these types of trays is possible because the oil has been f reed from degraded add i ti ves, carbon and many other impuri ties which might otherwise clog the trays. In other words, the waste oil has to be subj ected to chemical processes and physical separation before fractionation. As a I ready stated, these types of processes will generate effluents that are difficult to diepose of in an  envi ronmenta1 iy<br><br>
safe manner.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a process for the treatment of waste petroleum oil for obtaining refined petroleum oil therefrom eliminating or, at least, greatly minimising the abovementioned drawbacks aseociated with the known procegses of treating waste petroleum oil.<br>
The process, according to this invention, for the<br>
treatment of waste petroleum oil for obtaining<br>
refined petroleum oil therefrom, comprises<br>
introducing dehydrated waste petroleum oil into<br>
the upper portion of the bottom section of a<br>
distillation column recirculating the said oil<br>
by discharging the same oil from the lower portion<br>
of the bottom section of the column and reÂ¬<br>
introducing the same into the said upper portion,<br>
while separating and removing, as vapour, the<br>
various fractions from the recirculatlng oil;<br>
maintaining the interior of the column between 700<br>
mm Hg. to 760 mm Hg. vacuum; heating the<br>
recirculating oil so as to maintain the<br>
temperature	thereof        within	the<br>
bottom section of the column between 300 deg. C<br><br>
360  deg. C:  allowing  the vapours of the  heated recirculating  oil  to ascend upwardly  through  a plurality   of   chambers,   disposed   over   the bottom section of the column, one above the other, and  through trays separating the  chambers,  each tray  having a free passage surmounted by a  hood, the passages in the said trays, allowing  vapours, rising from the hot oil in the said upper portion, to  pass therethrough, and the hoods  constraini ng such  vapours to condense around the trays in  the respective chambers} tapping the condensed oil  of varioue  grades from such chambers;  and  spraying cold  oil  in at least one of such  chambers :  and ooJlecting  the remnsnt vapours f rom  the  topmost chamber.<br>
This invention will now be descr ibed w i th referenoe to the accompany ing drawings which 11 Iustrate by way of example one of the possible embod itnents of the apparatus empi oyad to carry out the process proposed herein, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 ill ustrates the distil iation column of the said embodiment<br><br>
Fig,2 illustrates a separate view of the tray used<br>
therein.<br>
The distillation column D has an inlet 11 near its base  for the entry of dehydrated waste  petroleum oil  into the bottom section R of the  column  at its base.<br>
The dehydrated oil is obtained from a dehydrator after removal of final traces of water and any lighter fractions of hydrocarbons present in the waste oil.<br>
The column D has an opening A at its bottom for allowing the reci rculation of the oil f rom the lower portion of the said bottom section R, through the inlet II, to the said upper portion.<br>
Means,  such as, a pump and heater are  provided for  recirculating  and heating the  oil  and  for separating  and vapourising the various  fractions of oil in the recirculating oil.<br>
Means, such as, a vacuum pump, steam ejectors  and<br><br>
the like are prov ided f or the column for maintain!ng the interior of the column under 700 mm   Hg,    to   760   mm   Hg   vacuum   pressure.<br>
Means  are  also  provided, for  the  colurm,  for maintaining the temperature of the oil within  the bottom section R of the col urnn between 300 deg,  C 360 deg, C.<br>
The column housoG a plurality of chambers {in the embod iment il lustrated, five chambers) CI to C5, d isposed one above the other, over the said bottom section R, for receiving the vapours of the hot oil from within the bottom section R, such chambers being separated from each other by trays T, The chambers may be structured as one unit (as illustrated) or as separate modules communicating with each other as convenience may dictate.<br>
Each tray has a free passage P surmounted by a hood H. The passages P in the trays T allow vapours (see arrows B), rising from the hot oil in the bottom section R, to pass freely therethroughr without clogging, while the hoods H constrain portions of such vapours (see arrows EI to condense  around  the  trays   in  the  respecti ve<br><br>
chambers. The condensate is indicated by F1 to F5. Each condensate is a grade of hydrocarbon oil, the higher the chamber, the lighter the fract i on.<br>
The chambers have outlets Gl to G5 for tapping and remov ing  the condensed oil of  var ious  grades theref rom.<br>
To assist or control the condensation of the oil in the chambers cold oil is sprayed in at 1 east one of the chambers e.g. through a pipe line J provided with perforations or nozzles. This oil is tapped from the condensate in any one of thp chambers C1 to C5.<br>
The column D has an open ing K at the top of the topmost chamber C5 for the ex it, and col1ection, of the remnant vapours therefrom. These vapours are taken to a separate chamber for condensation and collection. This will correspond to the lightest grade of oil. The non-condensible vapour and gas are sucked out by steam ejectors/vacuum pumps and sent for incineration. The column vacuum is maintai ned by thi B system.<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and eKpresslons of eKcludlng any equi valente of the features illustrated and described, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
