INFORMATION IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS BASED ON<br>
FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS<br>
PRIORITY<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(a) of a Korean<br>
Patent Application filed in the Korean Industrial Property Office on May 3, 2005 and<br>
assigned Serial No. 2005-37294, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to a wireless communication system based on<br>
frequency division multiple access. More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
method and apparatus for multiplexing and transmitting data and control information in a<br>
wireless communication system based on frequency division multiple access.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003]	Recent developments in broadcasting and mobile communication systems<br>
technology has led to the wide use of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) transmission scheme. The OFDM scheme eliminates the interference between<br>
multi-path signals, which is frequently found in wireless communication channels. Also, the<br>
OFDM scheme guarantees the orthogonality between multiple access users and facilitates an<br>
efficient use of resources. Therefore, the OFDM scheme is available for high speed data<br>
transmission and broadband systems more than the conventional Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA) scheme. However, the OFDM scheme is a multi-carrier transmission<br>
scheme, in which transmission data is distributed to multiple sub-carriers and is then<br>
transmitted in parallel. This causes the OFDM scheme to increase the Peak-to-Average<br>
Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmission signals.<br>
|0004]	A large PAPR causes distortion of output signals in a Radio Frequency (RF)<br>
power amplifier of a transmitter. Therefore, in order to solve such a problem, the transmitter<br><br>
requires power back-off to reduce the input power to the amplifier. Therefore, when the<br>
OFDM scheme is applied to the uplink of a mobile communication system, a terminal must<br>
perform the power back-off for the transmission signals, which results in the reduction of the<br>
cell coverage.<br>
[0005]	Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA) is being actively<br>
researched as a solution to solve the PAPR problem of the OFDM technology. The IFDMA<br>
guarantees the orthogonality between the multiple access users like the OFDM and is a<br>
technology based on a single sub-carrier, which shows a very low PAPR of transmission<br>
signals. Applying the IFDMA to a mobile communication system reduces the problem of cell<br>
coverage reduction due to the PAPR increase.<br>
[0006]	FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a typical IFDMA transmitter.<br>
[0007]	Although the structure shown in FIG. 1 uses a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)<br>
unit 104 and an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit 106, exemplary embodiments of<br>
the present invention are not limited to the shown structure and can be implemented by<br>
additional structures. The implementation that uses the FFT unit 104 and the IFFT unit 106 is<br>
advantageous because it facilitates an easy change of IFDMA system parameters without a<br>
high hardware complexity.<br>
[0008]	The OFDM and the IFDMA may have the following differences in the aspect<br>
of transmitter structure. In addition to the IFFT unit 106 which is used for multi-carrier<br>
transmission in the OFDM transmitter, the IFDMA transmitter includes the FFT unit 104<br>
located before the IFFT unit 106. Therefore, the transmission modulation (TX) symbols 100<br>
in FIG. 1 are input to the FFT unit 104 block by block, each of which includes M number of<br>
transmission modulation symbols. The block is referred to as "symbol block," and the period<br>
at which the symbol block is input to the FFT unit is referred to as "symbol block period."<br>
The signals output from the FFT unit 104 are input to the IFFT unit 106 at equal intervals, so<br>
that the IFDMA transmission signal elements are transmitted in the frequency domain by<br>
sub-carriers of equal intervals. In this process, it is usual for the input/output size N of the<br>
IFFT unit 106 to have a larger value than that of the input/output size M of the FFT unit 104.<br>
In the OFDM transmitter, the transmission symbol blocks 100 are directly input to the IFFT<br>
unit 106 without passing through the FFT unit 104 and are then transmitted by multiple sub-<br>
carriers, thereby generating a PAPR with a large value.<br>
[0009]	In the IFDMA transmitter, the transmission symbols are pre-processed by the<br>
FFT unit 104 before being processed by the IFFT unit 106. This occurs even though the<br>
transmission symbols are Finally processed by the IFFT unit 106 before being transmitted by<br><br>
multiple carriers. The pre-processing of the transmission symbols makes it possible, due to<br>
the counterbalancing between the FFT unit 104 and the IFFT unit 106, to have an effect<br>
similar to that which occurs when the output signals of the IFFT unit 106 are transmitted by a<br>
single sub-carrier, thereby achieving a low PAPR. Finally, the outputs of the IFFT unit 106<br>
are converted to a serial stream by a Parallel-to-Serial Converter (PSC) 102. Before the serial<br>
stream is then transmitted, a Cyclic Prefix (CP) or guard interval is attached to the serial<br>
stream as it is in the OFDM system, to prevent interference between multi-path channel<br>
signal elements.<br>
[0010]	FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of a transmitter based on a Localized Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (LFDMA) technique, which is similar to the IFDMA technique.<br>
The LFDMA technique also guarantees the orthogonality between multiple access users, is<br>
based on single carrier transmission, and can achieve a PAPR lower than that of the OFDM.<br>
As illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2, the difference between the LFDMA and the IFDMA in the<br>
view of transmitter structure is that the outputs of the FFT unit 204 turn into inputs to the<br>
IFFT unit 206, which have sequential indexes following the last index of the FFT unit 204. In<br>
the frequency domain, the LFDMA signals occupy the band constituted by adjacent sub-<br>
carriers used when the outputs of the FFT unit 204 are mapped into the inputs of the IFFT<br>
unit 206. In other words, in the frequency domain, the IFDMA signals occupy the sub-carrier<br>
bands (sub-bands) distributed at an equal interval, and the LFDMA signals occupy the sub-<br>
band constituted by adjacent sub-carriers.<br>
[0011]	In order to apply the IFDMA and LFDMA based systems to a broadcasting or<br>
mobile communication system, it is necessary to transmit data and to control information and<br>
a pilot signal for demodulation and decoding of the data in a receiver. The pilot signal has a<br>
guaranteed pattern between a transmitter and a receiver. Therefore, when a received signal<br>
has a distortion due to a wireless fading channel, the receiver can estimate and eliminate,<br>
based on the pilot signal, the distortion in the received signal due to the wireless fading<br>
channel. The control information includes a modulation scheme applied to the transmitted<br>
data, a channel coding scheme, a data block size, and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request<br>
(HARQ)-related information such as a serve packet ID. By receiving the control information,<br>
the receiver can understand the information applied to the transmitted data to perform various<br>
operations including demodulation and decoding of the received data.<br>
[0012]	According to the CDMA technique widely applied to current mobile<br>
communication systems, the data, control information, and pilot signal are transmitted by<br>
using different channelization codes. This allows the receiver to separate and detect the<br><br>
signals without interference. According to the OFDM technique, the data, control<br>
information, and pilot signal are transmitted by different sub-carriers or after being<br>
temporally divided.<br>
[0013]	Since the control information is not a large quantity of information capable of<br>
totally occupying one time slot, application of the time division-based multiplexing scheme<br>
may result in an unnecessary waste of resources. When the control information is transmitted<br>
by a separate sub-carrier different from that which carries the data as it does in the OFDM<br>
scheme, it is problematic in that the transmitted signal has an increased PAPR.<br>
[0014]	Accordingly, there is a need for an improved method and apparatus for<br>
multiplexing data and control information to lower a PAPR of a transmitted signal and to<br>
facilitate resource efficiency in an IFDMA or LFDMA-based communication system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]	An aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is to address at<br>
least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages<br>
described below. Accordingly, an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention<br>
is to provide a method and an apparatus for multiplexing data and control information to<br>

IFDMA or LFDMA-based communication system.<br>
[0016]	It is another object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention to<br>

to provide a method and an apparatus for multiplexing data by distributing control<br>
information in each symbol block period within a Transmission Time Interval (TTI) in an<br>

[0018]	In order to accomplish this object, an apparatus for transmitting data in a<br>

control information and data to be transmitted and the TTI includes multiple symbol block<br>
periods. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) unit performs FFT on the symbol block and an<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit performs IFFT on signals output from the FFT<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0034]	The matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and<br>
elements are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the embodiments of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes<br>
and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from<br>
the scope and spirit of the invention. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and<br>
constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.<br>
[0035]	An exemplary embodiment of the present invention proposes a method of<br>
multiplexing data and control information in at least one symbol block from among multiple<br>
symbol blocks included in one TTI and simultaneously transmitting the multiplexed data and<br>
control information. The method of multiplexing and simultaneous transmission can achieve<br>
a lower PAPR and results in a more efficient use of resources compared to the existing<br>
methods. The control information includes a modulation scheme applied to transmission data,<br>
a channel coding scheme, a data block size, and a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request<br>
(HARQ)-related information such as a sub-packet ID. This can be included together with<br>
control information, such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) or ACK/NACK.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 3 illustrates an apparatus for multiplexing and transmitting data, control<br>
information, and a pilot signal according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0037]	As shown in FIG. 3, a symbol block generator 304 of a transmitter generates a<br>
symbol block by multiplexing data, control information, or pilot signals to be transmitted for<br>
each symbol block period. The exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3 illustrates one Transmission<br>
Time Interval (TTI) which includes eight symbol block periods.<br>
[0038]	The symbol block generator 304 determines whether control information<br>
exists within the current TTI 300. When control information exists within the current TTI<br>
300, the symbol block generator 304 generates a symbol block including the control<br>
information and data in a predetermined symbol block period 302 within the TTI 300. The<br>
symbol block generator 304 generates symbol blocks which include data or a pilot signal<br><br>
without control information in other symbol block periods. Each symbol block includes M<br>
number of symbols, which are mapped to M number of inputs of the FFT unit 310.<br>
[0039]	In FIG. 3, the IFDMA or LFDMA transmission technique can be seen as the<br>
output signals of the FFT unit 310 by multi-carriers by using the IFFT unit 314. Therefore, N<br>
number of outputs from the IFFT unit 314 are converted to a serial stream by the PSC 102 as<br>
shown in FIG. 1, which is then transmitted with a CP attached thereto. At this time, each<br>
period in which the N outputs are generated corresponds to the symbol block period.<br>
[0040]	Therefore, each of the eight symbol blocks in the TTI 300 is input to the FFT<br>
unit 310 at a corresponding symbol block period. Each of the symbol blocks is an FFT input<br>
block input through all input taps of the FFT unit 310 and has the same size as the tap size M<br>
of the FFT unit 310. Further, the M outputs of the FFT unit 310 are mapped to the inputs of<br>
the IFFT unit 314 according to the mapping rule corresponding to the IFDMA or LFDMA<br>
technique to be applied which is similar to the techniques applied in FIGs. 1 and 2. Finally,<br>
the outputs of the IFFT unit 314 are converted to a serial stream, which is then transmitted<br>
together with a CP attached thereto.<br>
[0041]	FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a transmitter according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0042]	In step 900, the transmitter generates frames in TTI, that is, transmission data,<br>
by multiplexing data, control information, and pilot signals to be transmitted. When there is<br>
control information to be transmitted during one TTI, the transmitter inserts the control<br>
information into a symbol block predetermined within the TTI, and inserts data into a<br>
remaining portion of the symbol block. The pilot signal is included in and transmitted by one<br>
symbol block, and the data is included in a portion of the symbol block including the control<br>
signal and other symbol blocks except for the symbol block including the pilot signal. In step<br>
902, the transmitter performs FFT on a symbol block of a corresponding period at each<br>
symbol block period.<br>
[0043]	In step 904, the outputs of the FFT unit are mapped to the inputs of the IFFT<br>
unit according to the mapping rule corresponding to the applied IFDMA or LFDMA<br>
technique to be applied, and IFFT is then performed. In step 906, the transmitter attaches a<br>
CP to the output of the IFFT unit and then transmits it.<br>
[0044]	As described above, the method proposed by the first exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention is to multiplex the data 306 and the control information 304 at the<br>
FFT input side during one symbol block period. The pilot signal 308 is transmitted during<br>
one entire symbol block period. This method of transmission is different from that of the data<br><br>
306 and the control information 304. In the case of IFDMA or LFDMA transmission, when<br>
the pilot signal 308 is multiplexed together with data within the same symbol block period, it<br>
is difficult to perform channel estimation and normally demodulate the received data and<br>
control information. However, as noted from the following description regarding the<br>
operation of a receiver, even when the control information 304 is multiplexed together with<br>
the data 306 within one symbol block period, it is possible to demodulate and decode the<br>
received data 306 and the control information 304.<br>
[0045]	The method for multiplexing data 306, the control information 304, and the<br>
pilot signal 308 is applicable even to an IFDMA or LFDMA transmitter which is not based<br>
on the FFT and IFFT.<br>
[0046]	Multiplexing the data and control information in one IFDMA symbol stream<br>
as shown in FIG. 3 makes it possible to obtain a lower PAPR, in comparison with the case<br>
data and control information which are divided in the frequency domain and are then<br>
transmitted according to the IFDMA or LFDMA scheme by using different sub-carrier bands<br>
as in an OFDM system. Further, the method as shown in FIG. 3 facilitates a more efficient<br>
use of resources, in comparison with the case of temporally multiplexing the data and the<br>
control information and then transmitting them in different symbol block periods by IFDMA<br>
or LFDMA. This results from the fact that the control information usually has a small<br>
volume, and allocation of one symbol block period to the transmission of the control<br>
information would result in allocation of an unnecessarily large quantity of resources to the<br>
transmission of the control information and cause a reduction of many resources which could<br>
otherwise be used for the data transmission. This problem becomes more severe when it is<br>
necessary to transmit a large quantity of data at a high data rate.<br>
[0047]	Hereinafter, a description will be given regarding the frame format of a<br>
transmission IFDMA or LFDMA signal for normal demodulation and decoding of data by a<br>
receiver when the data and control information are multiplexed as described above.<br>
According to the quantity of data to be transmitted or the condition of a transmitted radio<br>
channel, different modulation schemes and coding schemes may be applied to the data<br>
Iransmission. When the HARQ technique is applied, different HARQ control information<br>
may be transmitted according to the retransmission situations. Therefore, normal<br>
demodulation of data is possible only when the receiver has recognized the control<br>
information by demodulating and decoding the control information.<br>
[0048]	The transmission format of the control information should be defined to be<br>
fixed to a specific transmission format or as one format used between the transmitter and the<br><br>
receiver at the time of radio link setup to facilitate normal demodulation of the control<br>
information for the user. The receiver can normally demodulate and decode the control<br>
information when the control information is mapped and transmitted with an always fixed<br>
modulation scheme and channel coding scheme, fixed number of control information bits,<br>
and fixed time slots and FFT inputs. For example, the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3<br>
illustrates the control information convolutionally encoded with a coding rate of 1/3 and then<br>
transmitted according to the QPSK modulation scheme, and includes L number of<br>
modulation symbols. The L modulation symbols are transmitted after being applied to the<br>
FFT inputs with input indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1) in the second symbol block period within the<br>
TTI. Then, the receiver can demodulate and decode the control information by using the<br>
transmission format of the control information, which is already recognized by the receiver.<br>
If the control is not transmitted with a fixed format, the receiver must try to detect the format<br>
for various possible formats by applying a blind format detection method.<br>
[0049]	FIG. 4 illustrates the FFT mapping in the symbol block period in which the<br>
control information and the data are multiplexed according to the first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the control information 400,<br>
including L modulation symbols, is applied to the inputs of the FFT unit 404 with input<br>
indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1), and the data is applied to the other FFT inputs, such as, the FFT<br>
inputs with the input indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1). It should be noted that the locations to which the<br>
modulation symbols of the control information 400 are mapped are not limited to the upper<br>
indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1). The control information may be mapped to any L number of taps<br>
known in advance to the transmitter and the receiver from among the M input taps of the FFT<br>
unit.<br>
[0050]	FIG. 5 illustrates a structure of a receiver according to the first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0051]	Referring to FIG. 5, the receiver first eliminates the CP from the received<br>
signal, performs FFT by the FFT unit 502, extracts the pilot signal from the output of the FFT<br>
unit 502, and then performs channel estimation. For example, the FFT unit 502 of the<br>
receiver converts the received signal input to the FFT unit 502 to a frequency domain signal,<br>
corresponding to the IFFT unit 314 shown in FIG. 3. When the output from the FFT unit 502<br>
corresponds to the pilot 510, the output of the FFT unit 502 is input to the channel estimator<br>
504. When the symbol block period in which the output of the FFT 502 occurs is a<br>
predetermined pilot period in one TTI as shown in FIG. 3, the output of the FFT unit 502 is<br>
considered as the pilot 510.<br><br>
[0052]	The channel estimator 504 generates channel estimation information 512 by<br>
estimating the channel condition from the pilot 510 and transfers the generated channel<br>
estimation information 512 to the channel compensation block 524 so that the IFFT unit 506<br>
can demodulate the data and control information. Thereafter, the output from the FFT unit<br>
502 is channel-compensated by using the channel estimation information 512 by the channel<br>
compensation block 524. The extraction of the pilot 510 by the channel estimator 504 and the<br>
channel compensation by the channel compensation block 524 may be performed by the<br>
output side of the IFFT unit 506.<br>
[0053]	The channel-compensated signal 526 is input to the IFFT unit 506 according<br>
to the IFDMA or LFDMA mapping rule applied in the transmitter, and is then subjected to<br>
the demodulation and decoding.<br>
[0054]	In the case of the symbol block period including the control information and<br>
data, since the control information has been transmitted after being applied to the input<br>
indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1) of the FFT unit 404, the IFFT unit 506 of FIG. 5 applies the outputs<br>
520 with the output indexes of 0 ~ (L - 1) to the control information demodulator/decoder<br>
508, so that it is possible to extract the control information. Further, in the case of data, since<br>
pure data may sometimes be transmitted in one symbol block period, all the outputs of the<br>
IFFT unit 506, such as, the outputs 518 with the output indexes of 0 ~ (M - 1) are applied to<br>
the data demodulator/decoder 522. When the modulation and coding schemes used by the<br>
transmitted data for data transmission, the quantity of data, the HARQ control information<br>
516, etc. have been transferred to the data demodulator/decoder 522 by the demodulation and<br>
decoding of the control information in the symbol block period corresponding to the control<br>
information, the decoded data is finally output from the data demodulator/decoder 522.<br>
[0055]	FIG. 8 is a flowchart for illustrating the operation of the receiver according to<br>
a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0056]	In step 800, the receiver eliminates the CP from the received signal, performs<br>
FFT, extracts the pilot from the FFT output, and then performs channel estimation. In step<br>
802, when the FFT output corresponds to a symbol block period including data and control<br>
information or a symbol block period including only data, the FFT output is channel-<br>
compensated by the channel compensation block 524.<br>
[0057]	The signal channel-compensated in step 804 is input to the IFFT unit<br>
according to the IFDMA or LFDMA mapping rule applied in the transmitter. The output<br>
with an index corresponding to the control information from among the IFFT output<br>
corresponding to the symbol block period including the data and the control information is<br><br>
converted through demodulation and decoding to the control information including<br>
modulation and coding schemes applied to the data, HARQ control information, etc.<br>
[0058]	In step 806, the control information is used to restore data by demodulating<br>
and decoding the IFFT output corresponding to the symbol block period including the data<br>
and the control information or the symbol block period including only the data.<br>
[0059]	FIG. 6 illustrates a method for multiplexing control information and data<br>
according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0060]	The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the<br>
control information 602 is transmitted after being distributed to multiple symbol block<br>
periods within one TO 600. The core of the second exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention is that the control information 602 is multiplexed with the data in each symbol<br>
block period 604 and is transmitted after being distributed to the multiple symbol block<br>
periods in the TO 600, thereby obtaining time diversity in a fading channel, which can<br>
improve the performance for detection of the control information. Referring to FIG. 6, in the<br>
symbol block period in which data and control information are multiplexed, the control<br>
information includes K number of symbols, data includes (M - K) number of symbols, and<br>
the control information and the data are applied to the input indexes of 0 ~ (K - 1) and K ~<br>
(M - 1) of the FFT unit 610, respectively. The parameters K and M have values which are<br>
determined by the quantity of necessary control information and the quantity of data to be<br>
transmitted, respectively.<br>
[0061]	In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, because of the<br>
applied modulation and coding scheme, the number of all the symbols, the FFT input<br>
mapping, etc. in the control information 602 are defined in advance between the transmitter<br>
and the receiver, the receiver can demodulate and decode the control information based on<br>
the pre-defined transmission format of the control information. Further, in the second<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to transmit the pilot 606 in the<br>
fourth symbol block period within one TTI, in order to reduce the pilot overhead, in<br>
comparison with the case of the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0062]	In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the transmission<br>
signal is mapped to the IFFT input 612 according to the IFDMA or LFDMA technique after<br>
passing through the FFT unit 610, is processed by the IFFT unit 614, and is then transmitted<br>
together with a CP attached thereto. The structure of the receiver for processing the<br>
transmission signal is basically analogous to those of the first exemplary embodiment shown<br>
in FIGs. 5 and 8. Differently from the first embodiment, the demodulation and the decoding<br><br>
of the data symbols are performed after the control information is obtained through reception,<br>
demodulation and decoding of all the symbols of the control information distributed in the<br>
multiple symbol block periods.<br>
[0063]	The flowcharts in FIGs. 8 and 9, according to the first exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention, are applicable to the second exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0064]	FIG. 7 illustrates a structure for mapping of IFFT outputs to the control<br>
information demodulator/decoder and the data demodulator/decoder in the receiver according<br>
to the first or second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0065]	As noted from FIG. 7, in the receiver, the outputs with indexes of 0 ~ (K - 1)<br>
and K ~ (M - 1) are applied to the control information demodulator/decoder 702 and the data<br>
demodulator/decoder 704, respectively. Each demodulator/decoder 702 or 704 can perform<br>
normal demodulation and decoding of the control information and the data.<br>
[0066]	According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as described<br>
above, data and control information are multiplexed in the same symbol block and are then<br>
transmitted by a single carrier by using an IFDMA or LFDMA scheme. Therefore, an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention can improve the efficiency in use of<br>
resources and achieve a lower Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), in comparison with the<br>
existing time division or frequency division multiplexing method.<br>
[0067]	While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
