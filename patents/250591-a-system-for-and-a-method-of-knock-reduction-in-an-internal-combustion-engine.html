ZONE BASED KNOCK REDUCTION SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR BELT<br>
ALTERNATOR STARTER HYBRID SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to engine control methods and<br>
systems for Belt Alternator Starter hybrid systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Vehicles can include an internal combustion engine that<br>
generates drive torque to drive wheels. More specifically, the engine draws in air<br>
and mixes the air with fuel to form combustion mixtures. The combustion<br>
mixtures are compressed within cylinders and are combusted to drive pistons<br>
that are disposed within respective cylinders. The pistons rotatably drive a<br>
crankshaft to transfer drive torque to a driveline and ultimately to the wheels.<br>
[0004] Modern engine control systems are designed to minimize<br>
exhaust emissions while maximizing power and fuel economy. Advancements in<br>
spark timing for a given air/fuel ratio are made to increase power and improve<br>
fuel economy. In general, advancing the spark relative to top dead center<br>
increases torque until a point is reached at which best torque is produced.<br>
Abnormal combustion, also known as engine knock, occurs when the spark is<br>
advanced too far. The temperature and pressure of the unburned air/fuel mixture<br>
exceeds a critical level causing the gases to auto ignite.    This combustion<br>
1<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
produces a shock wave that generates a rapid increase in cylinder pressure.<br>
Damage to pistons, rings, and exhaust valves can result if sustained heavy knock<br>
occurs. Additionally, most people find the sound of heavy engine knock<br>
undesirable.<br>
[0005] Conventional knock detection systems include a knock sensor<br>
and a dedicated knock detection chip (knock IC) to process the knock sensor<br>
signal and calculate the engine knock intensity. An individual knock sensor and<br>
knock IC can be used to detect knock from each cylinder. Conventional knock<br>
reduction systems detect knock during certain drive conditions and retard spark.<br>
The retardation of spark occurs regardless of changed drive conditions. This<br>
results in suboptimal engine performance and fuel consumption.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a knock reduction system for an internal<br>
combustion engine is provided. The system includes an engine operating zone<br>
selection module that selects a current engine operating zone from a plurality of<br>
engine operating zones based on engine speed, air per cylinder, and barometric<br>
pressure. A knock detection module generates a knock detection signal based<br>
on a detection of engine knock. An octane scaler adaptation module computes<br>
an octane scaler based on the current engine operating zone and the knock<br>
detection signal wherein engine spark is controlled based on the octane sealer.<br>
[0007] In other features, a method of reducing knock for an internal<br>
combustion engine is provided. The method includes: selecting a current engine<br>
2<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
operating zone from a plurality of engine operating zones based on engine<br>
speed, air per cylinder, and barometric pressure; generating an knock detection<br>
signal based on a detection of engine knock; computing an octane scaler based<br>
on the current engine operating zone and the knock detection signal; and<br>
controlling engine spark based on the octane scaler.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 including an<br>
engine system 11 is schematically illustrated. The engine system 11 includes an<br>
engine 12, an intake manifold 14, and an exhaust manifold 16. As can be<br>
appreciated, the engine system 11 can be any engine system including an<br>
internal combustion engine. In various embodiments, the engine system 11 can<br>
include a Belt Alternator Starter (BAS) hybrid engine system. Air is drawn into<br>
the intake manifold 14 through a throttle 18. The air is directed into cylinders 20<br>
and is mixed with fuel therein. The fuel is injected into the cylinders 20 by fuel<br>
injectors 22 that communicate with a fuel supply 24. Spark plugs 26 initiate<br>
combustion of the air/fuel mixture in their respective cylinders 20 and combustion<br>
exhaust exits the cylinders 20 and engine 12 through the exhaust manifold 16.<br>
Although only two cylinders 20 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the<br>
vehicle 10 may include an engine 12 having more or fewer cylinders 20.<br>
4<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
[0017] The combustion process drives pistons (not shown) that are<br>
disposed within the cylinders 20 and which, in turn rotatably drive a crankshaft<br>
27. The engine 12 further includes intake and exhaust valves, 28,30<br>
respectively, associated with each cylinder 20. The intake and exhaust valves<br>
28,30 respectively regulate air intake into the cylinders 20 and exhaust of<br>
combustion gases from the cylinders 20.<br>
[0018] A barometric pressure sensor 42 is responsive to an<br>
atmospheric pressure and generates a barometric pressure signal based<br>
thereon. An engine speed sensor 44 is responsive to rotation of the crankshaft<br>
27 and generates an engine speed signal based thereon. A knock sensor 48 is<br>
responsive to vibration of the cylinders 20 and generates a knock signal based<br>
thereon. A control module 40 processes the knock signal to detect engine knock.<br>
Although a single knock sensor 48 is illustrated, it can be appreciated that<br>
multiple knock sensors 48 can be implemented.<br>
[0019] The control module 40 regulates engine operation based on<br>
zone based knock reduction systems and methods of the present disclosure.<br>
More specifically, the control module 40 regulates spark timing relative to a<br>
position of the piston (not shown) in the cylinder 20 based on the presence and<br>
intensity of engine knock. Spark timing is determined from an octane sealer.<br>
The octane sealer is computed based on a zone based strategy as will be<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 2, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of a zone based knock reduction system that may be embedded<br>
5<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
within the control module 40. Various embodiments of zone based knock<br>
reduction systems according to the present disclosure may include any number<br>
of sub-modules embedded within the control module 40. The sub-modules<br>
shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly reduce engine<br>
knock. Inputs to the system may be sensed from the vehicle 10 (Figure 1),<br>
received from other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle 10 (Figure 1),<br>
and/or determined by other sub-modules (not shown) within the control module<br>
40. In various embodiments, the control module of Figure 2 includes an engine<br>
operating zone selection module 50, a knock detection module 52, and an octane<br>
sealer adaptation module 54.<br>
[0021] The engine operating zone selection module 50 receives as<br>
input air per cylinder (APC) 56, engine speed (RPM) 58, and barometric pressure<br>
60. As can be appreciated, air per cylinder 56 can be determined by the control<br>
module 40 based on engine operating parameters. The engine operating zone<br>
selection module 50 selectively determines a current engine operating zone 62<br>
based on engine speed 58, barometric pressure 60, and air per cylinder 56.<br>
More particularly a plurality of engine operating zones 62 can be defined by one<br>
or more predetermined engine speed hysteresis pairs and one or more<br>
predetermined air per cylinder hysteresis pairs. As shown in the example of<br>
Figure 3, six engine operating zones (zone 0, zone 1, zone 2, zone 3, zone 4,<br>
zone 5, and zone 6) can be defined by a predetermined engine speed hysteresis<br>
pair 70,72 that differentiates zone 0, zone 1, and zone 2 from zone 3, zone 4,<br>
and zone 5 and two predetermined air per cylinder hysteresis pairs 74,76 and<br>
6<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
78,80 that differentiate the different zones. The air per cylinder hysteresis pairs<br>
74,76 and 78,80 can be compensated by barometric pressure conditions.<br>
Therefore, based on the current engine speed 58, air per cylinder 56, and<br>
barometric pressure 60 a current engine operating zone 62 can be selected. It<br>
can be appreciated that fewer or more engine operating zones can be defined.<br>
Defining more engine operating zones will result in better engine performance<br>
and fuel economy. Defining fewer engine operating zones will reduce memory<br>
consumption and increase processor throughput.<br>
[0022] Referring back to Figure 2, the knock detection module 52<br>
receives as input one or more knock signals 64 received from the one or more<br>
knock sensors 48 (Figure 1). The knock detection module 52 detects excessive<br>
knock based on a comparison of the knock signal 64 and a predetermined knock<br>
intensity threshold. The knock detection module 52 sets a knock detection flag<br>
66 accordingly. It can be appreciated that one or more knock detection flags 66<br>
can be set according to the number of knock sensors 48 (Figure 1) and/or the<br>
number of cylinders 20 (Figure 1).<br>
[0023] The octane scaler adaptation module 54 receives as input the<br>
current engine operating zone 62 and the knock detection flag 66. The octane<br>
scaler adaptation module 54 computes an octane sealer 69 and associates it with<br>
the current engine operating zone 62. When the engine system 11 (Figure 1) is<br>
operating in a particular engine operating zone, the computed octane sealer<br>
allows the engine system 11 (Figure 1) to control spark to transition between a<br>
minimum advance for best timing (MBT) spark and a base spark based on<br>
7<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
whether knock is detected. For example, the octane sealer 69 is incremented if a<br>
new knock event is detected. Otherwise, the octane sealer is decremented to<br>
allow the engine system 11 (Figure 1) to recover from knock by learning back to<br>
MBT. In engine systems 11 implementing individual spark control for each<br>
cylinder 20, a separate octane sealer can be computed for each cylinder 20 or<br>
group of cylinders 20 as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Figure 4, the octane sealer adaptation module<br>
54 of Figure 2 will be discussed in more detail. The octane sealer adaptation<br>
system includes a sealer computation module 84 and a sealer blend module 86.<br>
As can be appreciated, the modules shown can be combined and/or further<br>
partitioned to similarly compute an octane sealer. The sealer computation<br>
module 84 receives as input the knock detection flag 66, the current engine<br>
operating zone 62, and a stored octane sealer 91. The stored octane sealer 91 is<br>
the computed octane sealer that was stored in memory 89 the last time the<br>
engine system 11 was operating in the particular engine operating zone 62. The<br>
sealer computation module 84 initializes the current octane sealer 90 to the<br>
stored octane sealer 91 and thereafter adapts the current octane sealer 90 for the<br>
current engine operating zone based on one of at least two methods. The sealer<br>
computation module 84 increments the octane sealer toward a base value when<br>
knock is detected. The sealer computation module 84 decrements the octane<br>
sealer toward MBT when knock is not detected. Table 1 illustrates the<br>
relationships between knock, octane sealer, and spark.<br>

Knock Occurs?	Octane Scaler Moves	Spark Moves<br>
	Towards	Towards<br>
Yes	1	Low Octane table<br>
No	0	High Octane table<br>
Table 1<br>
The incrementing and decrementing of the current octane scaler 90 allows spark<br>
control to transition between low octane and high octane levels. The low octane<br>
and high octane levels can be derived from predetermined spark tables stored in<br>
memory 89.<br>
[0025] The sealer computation module 84 may increment or decrement<br>
the octane sealer for each engine operating zone (OS[zone]) based on at least<br>
one of the stored octane sealer (Stored OS[zone]), an increment rate (/R)<br>
determined as a function of a current value of fast knock retard for the current<br>
engine operating zone (FKR[zone]), a gain value {Gain) determined as a function<br>
of spark (Spark), a learned gain (Gainlearn), and a predetermined decrement rate<br>
(DR). In various embodiments, the octane sealer (OS[zone]) 90 is incremented<br>
based on the following equation:<br><br>
In various embodiments, the octane sealer (OS[zone]) 90 is decremented based<br>
on the following equation:<br><br>
9<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
[0026] The gain is used to limit the movement of the octane sealer<br>
when there is little difference between the high octane table value and the low<br>
octane value derived from the two tables. The gain can be determined as a<br>
function of the difference between the two values derived from the two tables.<br>
The learned gain takes into account the propensity to knock at the current engine<br>
operating conditions. The learned gain increases the step in engine operating<br>
conditions where knock is likely to occur. The learned gain will decrease the step<br>
size if the engine is not likely to knock under the current operating conditions.<br>
[0027] The scaler blend module 86 receives as input the stored octane<br>
sealer of the current engine operating zone 91, the octane sealer of the previous<br>
engine operating zone 88, and the current engine operating zone 62. The sealer<br>
blend module 86 blends the octane sealer when transitioning between engine<br>
operating zones. The sealer blend module 86 blends the stored octane sealer of<br>
the current engine operating zone 91 when transitioning between engine<br>
operating zones based on one of at least three blend methods. The first method<br>
includes no blending. The computed octane sealer of the current engine<br>
operating zone 90 is used immediately if a difference between an octane sealer<br>
of the previous engine operating zone 88 and the stored octane sealer of the<br>
current engine operating zone 90 is below a predetermined delta threshold or the<br>
blend step is merely not desired (e.g., setting a predetermined enable flag to<br>
FALSE). The second method includes using an increasing blend if the stored<br>
octane sealer of the current engine operating zone 91 is greater than the octane<br>
sealer of a previous engine operating zone 88. The third method includes using<br>
10<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
a decreasing blend if the stored octane sealer of the current engine operating<br>
zone 91 is less than the octane sealer of the previous engine operating zone 88.<br>
[0028] In various embodiments, a blend step (BS) is computed based<br>
on the stored octane sealer for the old engine operating zone (Stored OS[zone])<br>
the computed octane sealer for the current engine operating zone OS[zone] and<br>
based on one of at least two equations:<br><br>
Where DecCount represents a predetermined value for a decreasing count and<br>
IncCount represents a predetermined value for an increasing count. The blend<br>
step (BS) is either added to or subtracted from the stored octane sealer of the<br>
current engine operating zone 91 based on whether increasing or decreasing<br>
blending is needed. The result is then set equal to the octane sealer of the<br>
current engine operating zone 90. The octane sealer of the current engine<br>
operating zone 90 can be stored in memory 89 for use by the engine system 11<br>
(Figure 1). In various embodiments, the memory 89 is a non-volatile type<br>
memory. This allows the octane sealer for each engine operating zone to be<br>
preserved across drive cycles.<br>
[0029] It can be appreciated that the methods of the sealer<br>
computation module 84 and the sealer blend module 86 can be mutually<br>
exclusive.  For example, once the sealer blend module 86 completes the blend<br>
11<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
method, a blend status flag 92 is set to COMPLETE. The scaler computation<br>
module 84 receives as input the blend status flag 92 and performs the<br>
incrementing and decrementing of the octane scaler of the current engine<br>
operating zone 90 when the blend status flag 92 indicates COMPLETE.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 5, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
other embodiments of the octane sealer adaptation module 54 of Figure 2. The<br>
octane sealer adaptation module 54 computes an octane sealer for each cylinder<br>
while operating within each engine operating zone. The octane sealer adaptation<br>
system can include a sealer computation module 84, a sealer maximum module<br>
93, and a sealer blend module 86. As can be appreciated, the modules shown<br>
can be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly compute an octane sealer<br>
or each cylinder and each engine operating zone.<br>
[0031] The sealer computation module 84 receives as input the knock<br>
detection flag 66 corresponding to the cylinder where knock was detected, the<br>
current engine operating zone 62, a stored octane sealer 91 corresponding to the<br>
current engine operating zone, and a stored octane sealer corresponding to a<br>
cylinder 95. The sealer computation module 84 initializes the octane sealers for<br>
each cylinder to the stored octane sealer 91. Thereafter, the sealer computation<br>
module 84 computes an octane sealer for each cylinder 94 based on the<br>
incrementing and decrementing methods as discussed above. More specifically,<br>
the sealer computation module 84 increments the octane sealer toward a base<br>
value when knock is detected. The sealer computation module 84 decrements<br>
the octane sealer toward MBT when knock is not detected.<br>

GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
[0032] The scaler computation module 84 may increment or decrement<br>
the octane scaler for each cylinder (OS[cylinder]) based on at least one of the<br>
stored octane sealer of the current cylinder (Stored OS[cylinder]), an increment<br>
rate (IR) determined as a function of a current value of fast knock retard of the<br>
current engine operating zone and current cylinder (FKR[zone][cylinder]), a gain<br>
value (Gain) determined as a function of spark (Spark), the learned gain<br>
(Gainleam), and a predetermined decrement rate (DR).<br>
[0033] In various embodiments, the octane sealer is incremented<br>
based on the following equation:<br><br>
In various embodiments, the octane sealer is decremented based on the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
[0034] The sealer maximum module 93 receives as input the computed<br>
octane sealer for each cylinder 94 and the current engine operating zone 62.<br>
The sealer maximum module 93 determines a sealer maximum (maxOS) of the<br>
computed octane sealers for each cylinder. The octane sealer for the current<br>
engine operating zone 90 is set equal to the maximum and stored in memory 89.<br>
The sealer maximum module 93 can also limit the delta between the computed<br>
octane sealers for the individual cylinders 20 and the maximum.   For example,<br>
13<br><br>

the octane scaler for each cylinder is limited by a maximum of either the<br>
maximum minus a predetermined delta (MaxDelt) or the current value of octane<br>
scaler for the particular cylinder as shown as:<br><br>
[0035] The sealer blend module 86 blends the stored octane sealer of<br>
the current engine operating zone 91 and the octane sealer of the previous<br>
engine operating zone 88 when transitioning between each engine operating<br>
zone 62 as discussed above. The sealer blend module 86 then sets the octane<br>
sealer for each cylinder to the blended octane sealer and stores the octane sealer<br>
for each cylinder in memory 89. As discussed above, the memory 89 may be a<br>
non-volatile type memory.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figure 6, a flowchart illustrates a zone based<br>
knock reduction method as performed by the control module 40 of Figure 1. The<br>
method may be run continually during engine operation. The method may be<br>
implemented for engine systems including individual spark control for each<br>
cylinder. At 100, the current engine operating zone is determined based on<br>
engine speed, barometric pressure, and air per cylinder. If the current engine<br>
operating zone does not equal the previous engine operating zone, the engine<br>
system is transitioning between engine operating zones. Otherwise the engine<br>
system is not transitioning between engine operating zones. If the engine<br>
system is not transitioning between engine operating zones at 110, control<br>
evaluates whether the blend is complete at 120. If the blend is complete at 120,<br>
14<br><br>

Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
for each cylinder at 130, an octane scaler is computed at 140 as discussed<br>
above. Once an octane scaler is computed for each cylinder, a maximum of the<br>
octane sealers is determined at 150. Control then sets the octane sealer of the<br>
current engine operating zone (OS[zone]) to the maximum and stores the octane<br>
sealer of the current engine operating zone in memory at 160. For each cylinder<br>
at 170, control limits the octane sealer (OS[cylinder]) based on the maximum at<br>
180. The octane sealer for each cylinder (OS[cylinder]) is stored in memory at<br>
190.<br>
[0037] Otherwise, if the engine system is transitioning between engine<br>
operating zones at 110 or the blend is not complete at 120, blending is performed<br>
at 190 as discussed above. For each cylinder at 200, the octane sealer<br>
(OS[cylinder]) is set equal to the blend value at 210 and stored in memory at 220.<br>
The blend method continues until the blending is complete at 120. The blend<br>
may be complete once the octane sealer of the cylinder (OS[cylinder]) is equal to<br>
the octane sealer of the current engine operating zone (OS[zone]).<br>
[0038] Similarly, a single octane sealer for each engine operating zone<br>
(OS[zone]) can be computed as shown by the engine operating zone based<br>
knock reduction method in Figure 7. At 300, the current engine operating zone is<br>
determined based on engine speed, barometric pressure, and air per cylinder. If<br>
the engine system is not transitioning between engine operating zones at 310,<br>
control evaluates whether blend is complete at 320. If the blend is complete at<br>
320, an octane sealer (OS[zone]) is computed at 330 and stored in memory at<br>
340.<br>
15<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308633-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000443<br>
[0039] Otherwise, if the engine system is transitioning between engine<br>
operating zones at 310 or the blend is not complete at 320, blending of the<br>
octane scaler (OS[zone]) is performed at 350 and stored in memory at 360. The<br>
blend method continues until the blending is complete at 320. The blend may be<br>
complete once the octane scaler of the current engine operating zone reaches<br>
the stored octane sealer of the current engine operating zone.<br>
[0040] As can be appreciated, all comparisons discussed above can be<br>
implemented in various forms depending on the selected values for comparison.<br>
For example, a comparison of "greater than" may be implemented as "greater<br>
than or equal to" in various embodiments. Similarly, a comparison of "less than"<br>
may be implemented as "less than or equal to" in various embodiments. A<br>
comparison of "within a range" may be equivalently implemented as a<br>
comparison of "less than or equal to a maximum threshold" and "greater than or<br>
equal to a minimum threshold" in various embodiments.<br>
[0041] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>
and the following claims.<br>
