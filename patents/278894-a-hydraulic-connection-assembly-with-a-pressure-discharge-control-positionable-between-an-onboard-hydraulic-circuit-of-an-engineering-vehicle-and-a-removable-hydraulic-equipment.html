				<td>'A hydraulic connection assembly with a pressure discharge control, positionable between an onboard hydraulic circuit of an engineering vehicle and a removable hydraulic equipment'"<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic connection assembly with a pressure discharge control, which is positionable between an onboard hydraulic circuit of an engineering vehicle and a removable hydraulic equipment.<br>
The engineering vehicles with onboard hydraulic circuits (excavators, front loaders, etc.) usually have the possibility to connect the circuit itself to removable hydraulic equipment (for instance, hammers, miller cutter, etc.) by means of the connection of flexible hoses and rapid couplings.<br>
In some vehicles, the hydraulic system may remain in residual pressure when the equipment is disconnected.<br>
It is therefore required to firstly connect or disconnect the equipment, discharge the pressure of the onboard hydraulic system, by means of manoeuvres to be performed on the controls of the engineering vehicle.<br>
That is, it is required to leave the post near the equipment, enter the control post of the engineering vehicle and discharge the pressure; then the equipment is approached and its connection or disconnection is performed by means of manual rapid coupling.<br>
Alternatively, the operation may be performed by two people, thus increasing the costs of the operation.<br>
Without these operations, the connection or disconnection of the hydraulic equipment is impossible or dangerous.<br>
WO-A-2004/070241 describes a hydraulic assembly, positionable between the engineering vehicle and the removable equipment. Such a hydraulic assembly has a one-piece bod}7 including hydraulic linkages to pressure lines of the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle and to corresponding<br>
feeding inputs for removable equipment, a hydraulic linlcage to a draining line, normally closed discharge valves positioned between said linkages to pressure lines and said linlcage to a draining line and a control for the pressure discharge which is operable so as to cause the opening of one and/or the other of said normally closed valves for the connection of the above said pressure lines to the draining line for the discharge of the pressure existing in the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle.<br>
The two valves are ball valves and the pressure discharge control consists of a knob rotatable around its longitudinal axis in order to allow one or more cam surfaces of a rod thereof to act on the control ball of one and/or the other of the above said valves to cause the opening thereof.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to make a hydraulic assembly positionable between an onboard hydraulic circuit of an engineering vehicle and a removable hydraulic equipment, in which a different and more efficient and safe pressure discharge control is provided for.<br>
According to the invention such an object is achieved by a hydraulic assembly comprising a one-piece body attachable to the outside of the hydraulic machine near the hydraulic equipment and provided with at least one hydraulic input linlcage connectable to a pressure line of the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle, at least one suitable coupling for the connection with a feeding input of a removable equipment and a hydraulic pressure discharge linlcage connectable to a draining line, at least one normally closed discharge valve positioned between said linlcage to a pressure line and said linkage to a draining line and a pressure discharge control operable so as to cause the opening of said at least one normally closed valve for the connection of the above said pressure line to the draining line for the discharge of the pressure existing in the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle, characterised in that said discharge valve is of the sliding piston-type and said pressure discharge control is formed by a lever rotatable around a transversal axis between a stable resting position and a working position in which a side of said lever exerts an axial thrust on said sliding piston for the opening control of said valve.<br>
In this manner there are ensured the stable and safe positioning of the control lever and of the discharge valve in the normal resting position to ensure the correct connection between the onboard hydraulic circuit and the removable equipment, and at the same time a simple and convenient transversal displacement of the lever allows to perform a precise and safe opening intervention of the valve by means of an axial thrust on its sliding piston.<br>
Preferably there is provided the possibility to also lead the working position of the pressure discharge lever to be stable for the whole time required for the discharge of the pressure of the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle.<br>
Furthermore, it may be arranged for the one-piece body to have two linkages to pressure lines and two couplings for the connection to removable equipment, and for two discharge valves operated by a single pressure discharge lever to according!}" be provided, the lever having in this case a resting position and two working positions, preferably arranged symmetrically like the two discharge valves, the two linkages and the two couplings.<br>
The features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of possible embodiments thereof shown by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Figures 10 and 11 show different perspective views of a variant of the hydraulic assembly according to the present invention which provides for four linkages to pressure lines and four couplings for removable equipment;<br>
Figure 12 shows an enlarged scale view from the side of the couplings of the hydraulic assembly in Figures 10 and 11;<br>
Figure 13 shows a section view of said hydraulic assembly along line XIII-XIII in Figure 12.<br>
The hydraulic assembly shown in Figures 1-3 comprises a one-piece body 1 to which a valve assembly 3 is laterally attached in a detachable manner by means of screws 2.<br>
A one-piece body 1, shown in detail in Figure 5, is intended for the hydraulic connection to an onboard hydraulic circuit of a hydraulic machine and for the attachment to the outside thereof near the removable equipment fed by said hydraulic circuit. For such a purpose, the one-piece bod}' 1 comprises two end linkages 4 and 5 for the connection to respective pressure lines of the hydraulic circuit of the vehicle and an intermediate linkage 6 for the connection to a draining line of the hydraulic circuit itself, in turn connected to a hydraulic liquid tank, usually oil. Respective couplings 7 and 8 (preferabh' rapid couplings) for the connection to respective feeding inputs for removable equipment are arranged in front of the linkages 4 and 5 for the pressure lines and in direct hydraulic connection therewith by means of holes 44 and 45 and a coupling 9 (this preferably being a rapid coupling as well) for the connection to a possible draining output of the removable equipment is arranged in front of the linkage 6 for the draining line and in direct hydraulic connection therewith by means of a hole 46. At least one of the linkages 5 and 6 is provided with a side flange 10 provided with holes 11 for fastener screws for the mechanical attachment of the one-piece block 1 to the hydraulic machine.<br>
Within the one-piece body 1 there are provided passages 12 and 13 (highlighted in black), which hydraulically connect the linkages 4 and 5 for pressure lines with respective inputs 14 and 15 of the valve assembly 3 and further passages 16 and 17 (highlighted in black), which hydraulically connect respective outputs 18 and 19 of the valve assembly 3 with the linkage 6 for the draining line (Figures 4, 5 and 6).<br>
The valve assembly 3. shown externally in Figure 6 and internally in Figures 4. 8 and 9. comprises an external body 20. within which two pressure discharge valves 21 and 22 are housed, which communicate with the above said inputs 14 and 15 and outputs 18 and 19 and therefore with the internal passages 12, 13,16 and 17 of the one-piece body 1.<br>
Each of the two valves 21 and 22 is formed as shown in Figure 7. that is it comprises a valve body 23 provided with an input 24 and an output 25, respectively connected with the inputs 14 and 15 and with the outputs 18 and 19 of the valve assembly 3. as well as an axial passage 26 for the communication between the input 24 and the output 25. a stopper 27 which is axially mobile between a closed position of said axial passage 26 in virtue of a gasket 28 (Figure 8) and an opening position of said axial passage 26 (Figure 4. 7 and 9). a spring 29 biasing between a closing cap 30 of the housing compartment of the valve in the external body 20 and the stopper 27 to elastically push it in said closed position against the gasket 28 and finally an operating piston 31, which axialh' extends from the housing compartment of the valve and against which an end rod 32 of the stopper 27 rests by the effect of the spring 29.<br>
Between the operating pistons 31 of the two valves 21 and 22. in a transversal compartment 33. a longitudinal rod 34 of a pressure discharge lever 35 is housed, which is rotatable around a transversal pin 36 from the resting position in Figure 8, in which a rounded part 37 of the rod 34 remains distanced from the operating pistons 31 to allow the stoppers 27 of the two valves to remain in a closed position.<br>
A sleeve 38 stressed by a spring 39 towards an internal shoulder 40 of the rod 34 is slidingly fitted on the rod 34, as shown in Figure 8. An operating knob 41 is screwed on the front end of the sleeve 38. An elastically deformable hood 42 protects the input mouth 43 of the compartment 33, which is flared towards the outside to allow the positioning of the lever 35 in the tilted position in Figure 9 or in an oppositely tilted position, from the entry of dust or other material, as will be explained hereafter.<br>
During operation, when the pressure discharge lever 35 is stably held in the resting position of Figure 8 by the elastically forced insertion maintained by the sleeve 38 in the housing compartment 33, both of the discharge valves 21 and 22 are closed so that the oil or other liquid coming from the pressure lines of the hydraulic circuit of the engineering vehicle directly passes from the linkages 4 and 5 to the couplings 7 and 8, which are normally closed.<br>
To connect the equipment to the onboard hydraulic circuit of the engineering vehicle the hydraulic circuit itself must be discharged in advance.<br>
As far as the pressure line connected to the linkage 4 is concerned, this may be obtained by operating by traction on the knob 41 of the pressure discharge lever 35 until the sleeve 38 is extracted from the compartment 33 against the bias of the spring 39 and by then rotating the lever itself around the pin 36 until the tilted position in Figure 9 is reached, where it is held by the front engagement of the sleeve 38 with an edge of the input mouth 42 of the compartment itself.<br>
The rounded portion 37 of the rod 34 thus axially pushes the operating piston 31 of the discharge valve 21. which in turn forces the axial sliding of the stopper 27 to the opening position of the valve, that is the communication position between the input 24 and the output 25 of the valve and thus between the internal passages 12 and 16 of the one-piece body 1. The pressure line connected to the linkage 4 is thus connected with the draining line connected to the linkage 6 with subsequent discharge of the feeding pressure. A hydraulic equipment may thus be connected to the onboard hydraulic circuit of the engineering vehicle by means of the feeding coupling 7 and, if required, by means of the draining coupling 9.<br>
In a totally similar manner, the pressure discharge lever 35 may be shifted to a symmetrical position with respect to Figure 9, so as to cause the opening of the valve 22 and the subsequent discharging of the pressure line connected to the linkage 5 and the similarly subsequent connection to an equipment to the coupling 8.<br>
The pressure discharge lever 3 5 may then be shifted to the stable resting position in Figure 8 to allow the feeding of the connected hydraulic equipment.<br>
Reverse operations are performed before carrying out the disconnection of the removable equipment from the onboard hydraulic circuit of the engineering vehicle.<br>
It is apparent that by arranging the hydraulic assembly of Figures 1 -9 outside the engineering vehicle and near the mechanical attachment point of the removable equipment, the pressure discharge operations and the connection and disconnection of the removable equipment may be carried out conveniently and rapidly, thus saving in terms of time and costs. Figures 10-13 show a hydraulic assembly of the same type as that in Figures 1 -9, which may serve four pieces of equipment and for this purpose is provided with a one-piece body 51, four linkages 52 for pressure lines, a linkage 53 for the draining line, four rapid couplings 54 for controlled equipment, four discharge valves 55 and a pressure discharge lever 56.<br>
