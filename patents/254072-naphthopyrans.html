				<td>The present invention relates to naphthopyrans, compositions and articles containing them.<br>
The present invention concerns novel compounds of the naphthopyran type, presenting, in particular, photochromic properties. It also concerns the photochromic compositions and ophthalmic articles (for examples, lenses) which contain naphthopyrans.<br>
Photochromic compounds are capable of changing colors due to the influence of poly- or monochromatic light (for example, UV radiation) and to recover their initial color again when the luminous irradiation stops, or under the influence of poly- or monochromatic light different from the first one, or under the influence of temperature and/or poly- or monochromatic light different from the first one.<br>
These photochromic compounds find applications in different fields, for example, in the manufacture of ophthalmic lenses, contact lenses, sun protection glasses, filters, optical systems of cameras or photographic apparatuses or other optical and observation devices, paneling, decorative objects, display elements or for the storage Of information by optical inscription (coding).<br>
In the field of ophthalmic optics, and in particular in eyeglass wear, a photochromic lens, comprising one or more photochromic compounds, must present:<br>
-	high transmission in darkness or in the absence of sunlight,<br>
-	low transmission (high colorability) under similar irradiation,<br>
-	an adapted coloration or discoloration kinetics,<br>
-	a tint that is acceptable to the consumer (preferably gray or chestnut brown) with, preferably, maintenance of the selected tint during the coloration or discoloration of the lens,<br>
-	maintenance of the performances of the properties in a temperature range of 0-40°C,<br>
-	high durability, because the targeted objectives are sophisticated and hence corrective lenses are expensive.<br>
These lens characteristics are in fact determined by the active photochromic compounds which must in addition be compatible with the organic material or mineral constituting the lens.<br>
It should also be noted that the obtention of a gray or chestnut brown tint should require the use of at least two photochromes of different colors, tiiat is, having different maximum absorption wavelengths in the visible range. This association also places other requirements on photochromic compounds. In particular the coloration and discoloration kinetics of the two or more associated active photochromic compounds must be essentially identical. The same applies to their stability over time and, also, to their compatibility with a plastic or mineral support.<br>
Among the numerous photochromic compounds described in the prior art, one can cite the naphthopyrans described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,567,605, 3,627,690, 4,826,977, 5,200,116, 5,458,814 and Research Disclosure No. 36144:<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The claim is made that these compounds satisfy the above defined specifîcations. In fact, whereas these compounds have in fact one or more of the desired basic properties, such as high transmission in darkness and high colorability under solar irradiation, all the compounds described to this day do not have the complete combination of desired properties required for the production of satisfactory ardcles that can be manufactured industrially. Although the prior art teaches how to modify the discoloration kinetics by the presence of a methyl group in Rl and R2, it does not teach how to modify the profîle of the visible spectrum of the activated form (exposure to UV). The compounds of the prior art are generally orange or red with a principal absorption bând in the visible range.<br>
It is the merit of the applicant to have found, surprisingly, that the presence of at least two alkoxy groups, at R3 and R5, allowed the obtention of photochromes having two intense absorption bands in the visible range and at high values of A^». The compounds of the invention thus cover a part of the visible spectrum (400-700 nm).<br>
Thus, the present invention concerns compounds, particularly photochromic compounds, having the following general formula (I):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which:<br>
•	Rl, R2, R4 and R6 are identical or different and they represent, independentiy<br>
•	hydrogen,<br>
•	a halogen, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromirie,<br>

•	a cycloalkyl or bicycloalkyl group comprising 3 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
•	a linear or branched alkoxy group comprising 1-12 carbon atoms,<br>
•	a linear or branched haloalkyl or haloalkoxy group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably a<br>
fluoroalkyl group,<br>
•	a linear or branched alkenyl or alkynyl group comprising 1-12 carbon atoms, preferably a<br>
vinyl or allyl group,<br>
•	a methacryloyl group or an acryloyl group,<br>
•	an epoxy group having the formula //insert a, p.4//<br>
in which n = l, 2 or 3<br>
•	an aryl or aryloxyl group, whose aryl group comprises 6-24 carbon atoms, or a heteroaryl or<br>
heteroaryloxy group whose heteroaryl group comprises 4-24 carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom<br>

•	a linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
•	a linear or branched alkoxy group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
•	a linear or branched haloalkyl or haloalkoxy group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably a<br>
fluoroalkyl group,<br>
•	an -NH2 group,<br>
•	an NHR group, where R represents a linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1-6 carbon<br>
atoms,<br>
•	a NRH" group, where R1 and R", which may be identical or different, independentiy represent<br>
a linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms or they represent, together with the<br>
nitrogen atom to which they are bound, a 5-7-member ring which can comprise at least one other<br>
heteroatom selected from the group of oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, said nitrogen being optionally<br>
substituted by a linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
•	an aralkyl or heteroalkyl group whose linear or branched alkyl group comprises 1-4 carbon<br>
atoms and whose aryl and heteroaryl groups are as defîned above,<br>
•	an -NH7, -NHR, NR.'R", CONH2, CONHR or CCNRH" group, where R, R1 and R" are as<br>
defined above,<br>
•	an OCOR'or COOR'group, where R'represents a linear or branched alkyl group comprising<br>
1-6 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl or bicycloalkyl group comprising 3-12 carbon atoms or an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl group as defined above,<br><br>
•	a polyether, polyamide, polycarbonate, polycarbamate, polyurea or polyester residue;<br>
R7 and R8 are identical or different and they represent independently:<br>
•	a linear or branched alkyl group comprising 1-12 carbon atoms,<br>
•	a cycloalkyl group comprising 3-12 carbon atoms,<br>
•	an aryl or heteroaryl group as defined above for Rl, R2, R4 and R6,<br>
•	the julolidin-9-yl group, or<br>
•	the two groups R7 and R8 together form an adamantyl, norbornyl, fluorenylidene or di(Cl-C6<br>
alkyl)anthracenylidene or spiro(C5-C6 cycloalkyl)anthracenylidene group; characterized in that R3 and<br>
R5 are identical or different and they each represent a linear or branched alkoxy group comprising 1-6<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
Among the substituents that can be considered for the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention, groups should be considered that comprise and/or form at least one function which can be polymerized and/or crosslinked, which group are preferably selected from the following list: alkenyl, advantageously vinyl, methacryloyl, acryloyl, acryloxyalkyl, methacryloxyalkyl or epoxy.<br>
Thus, the photochromic compounds according to the invention can be monomers, of different types or not, that can react with each other or with other comonomers to form homopolymers and/or copolymers that bear a photochromic functionaliry and possess mechanical properties of macromolecules. It follows that one of the objects of the present invention consists of these homopolymers or copolymers comprising (co)monomers and/or of crosslinked compounds, that, at least in part, consist of photochromic compounds (I) according to the invention.<br>
In the same order of ideas, the above-mentioned compounds (I) can be crosslinking agents that have reactive functions capable of allowing the formation of bridges between chains of polymers of photochromic nature or not. The crosslinked compounds that can be obtained in this manner also are a part of the present invention.<br>
In a generally preferred manner, the alkoxy groups are methoxy groups. Preferred compounds of the invention have the following formulas (II and 12):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R7 and R8 are polyaromatic or polyheteroaromatic groups that are optionally substituted by one or more C1-C5 alkoxy groups, C1-C6 amine or alkyl groups or C6-C12 aryl groups.<br>
It is the merit of the appiicant to have disclosed these compounds, because they present particularly advantageous photochromic properties. More precisely, they have a strong colorability with two absorption bands in the visible range with high X,^ vameş.<br>
These compounds are also prcferably stable and compatible with matrices made of organic polymer or mineral material, both in the form included in the matrix and in the form of the coating.<br>
In a solution or in the polymer matrix, the compounds according to the invention are colorless or slightly colored in the iniţial state and they rapidiy develop an intense coloration under UV light (365 nm) or a luminous source of the solar type. They rapidiy recover their iniţial color when the irradiation stops.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be obtained by the condensation of a derivative of 1-naphthol that is suitably substituted and<br>
-	either a derivative of propargyî alcohol (the condensation, according to this variant, can be<br>
carried out in solvents such as toluene, xylene or tetrahydrofuran and, optionally, in the presence of a<br>
catalyst such as<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid, chloroacetic acid or acid aiuminic acid)<br>
-	or a derivative of acrolein (in the presence of titanium tetraethylate).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
These synthetic pathways are cfassical and have been described in the above-mentioned references of the prior art as well as in European Patent No. A-0,562,915. The ketones (R7)(R8)CO are either commercially available or easily synthesized by the classical methods, for example, the FriedeHCrafts reaction from an acid chloride. The derivatives of propargyl alcohol are then obtained by the reaction of litiu'um acetylide with the corresponding ketones. The derivatives of acrolein can be<br>
t<br>
obtained by rearrangement of the corresponding derivative of propargyl alcohol in an acidic medium (see J. Org. Chem. 1977, Voi. 42, p. 3403, Edens et al.).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The derivatives of 1-naphthol are obtained by various methods adapted from the literature. Below we give some references on methods that allow the synthesis of the compounds of the inveation.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Regarding the application of the compounds according to the present invention, it should be noted that they can be used as a photochromic material dispersed in the composition of a polymer matrix. They can also be used in solution.<br>
A photochromic solution can be obtained by dissolving the compound in an organic solvent, such as toluene, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or ethanol. The solutions obtained are generally colorless and transparent. When exposed to suniight, they develop a strong coloration and they recover the color of this state when placed in a zone with lesser exposure to solar radiation or, in other words, when they are no longer exposed to UV radiation. In general a very low concentration of products (on the order of 0.01-5%) is sufficient to obtain an intense coloration.<br>
The most interesting apph'cations are those in which the photochrome is dispersed uniformly within or on the surface of a polymer, copolymer or mixture of polymers. The implementation methods that can be considered are of a great variety. Among those known to a person skilled in the art, one can cite, for example, difrusion in the (co)polymer, from a suspension or solution of the photochrome, in a silicone oii, in an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, in a glycol, or from another polymer matrix. Currently the difrusion is carried out at a temperature of 50-200°C for a duration of 15 min to severa! hours, depending on the nature of the polymer matrix. Another implementation technique consists in<br>
mixing the photochrome in a formulation of polymerizable materials, in depositing this mixture on a surface or in a mold and in then carrying out the polymerization. These implementation techniques and others are described in the article by CRANO et al. "Spiroxazines and their use in photochromic lenses," published in Applied Photochromic Polymer Systems. Publishers Blackie and Son Ltd., 1992. According to a variant of the invention, it is also possible to consider grafting the photochromes onto (co)polymers. Thus, another object of the invention consists of the (co)polymers grafted with at least one of the photochroraes described above.<br>
t<br>
As examples of preferred polymer materials for optical applications of the photochromic compound according to the invention, one can mention the following products:<br>
- alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl poly(mono-, di-,<br>
tri-, tetra)acrylate or poly(mono-, di-, tri-, tetra) methacrylate, optionally halogenated or comprising at least ether and/or ester and/or carbonate and/or carbamate and/or tniocarbamate and/or urea and/or amide group; polystyrene, polycarbonate (e.g., bisphenol A polycarbonate, poly(carbonate of diallyl diethylene glycol), polyepoxy, polyurethane, polythiourethane, polysiloxane, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, aliphatic or aromatic polyester, vinyl polymers, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate-propionate or polyvinylbutyral,<br>
- copolymers of two or more types of monomers or mixtures of the above-mentioned polymers, preferably polycarbonate-polyurethane, poly(meth)acrylate-polyurethane, polystyrene-poly(meth)acrylate or polystyrene-polyacrylonitrile, advantageously a mixture of polyester and/or polycarbonate or poly(meth)acrylate.<br>
The quantity of photochrome used depends on the desired degree of darkening. In particular, it is used in a quantity of 0.001-20 wt%. The photochromic compounds according to the invention can be used alone or in a mixture with other products to form a composition that can be in solid or liquid form, for example, in a solution or in a dispersion, as has already been mentioned above. These compositions, which constituie another object of the invention, can comprise one or more compounds (I) according to the invention and other complementary photochromic compounds which allow the obtention of dark colorations, for example, gray or brown, which the public desires in apph'cations such as ophthalmic or sun-protection eyewear. These additional photochromic compounds can be those known to a person skilled in the art and described in the literature, for example, chromenes (U.S. Patent Nos. 3,567,605, 5,238,981, World Patent No. 9,422,850, European Patent No. 562,915), spiropyrans or naphthospiropyrans (U.S. Patent No. 5,238,981) and spiroxazines (CRANO et al., "Applied Photochromic Polymer Systems," Publishers Blackie &amp; Son Ltd., 1992, Chapter 2). These compositions according to the invention can also comprise:<br>
-	nonphotochromic dyes allowing the adjustment of the tint,<br>
-	and/or one or more stabilizers, such as, for example, an antioxidant,<br>
-	and/or one or more anti-UV screens,<br>
-	and/or one or more anti [firee] radical agents,<br>
-	and/or deactivators that deactivate the states of photochemical excitation.<br>
These additives can allow the improvement of the durability ofsaid compositions.<br>
According to another one of its aspecte pertaining to the application of the photochromic compounds (T), the present invention also relates îo ophthalmic articles, such as articles of ophthalmic or sun protection eyewear articles, comprising at least one compound according to the invention and/or at least one (co)polymer formed, at least ui part, of repeating units derived from compounds having formula (I), and/or at least one composition comprising compounds (I), according to the invention, as defined above, and/or at least one matrix, as defined above, made of an organic polymer material or a mineral material or a mineral-organic hybrid material incorporating at least one compound of the invention.<br>
In practice, the articles to which the present invention applies more particularly are photochromic ophthalmic or sun-protection lenses, glass paneling (glasses for buildings, for locomotion devices, automobiles), optica! devices, decorative articles, sun-protection articles, infonnation storage, etc.<br>
The present invention will be better understood in the light of the following examples of synthesis and photochromic validation of compounds having the general formula (I).<br>

Example 10<br>
Incorporation of the compounds in a polyacrylate<br>
General procedure: IO"4 mol of each one of the compounds are dissolved in 100 g of tetraethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (marketed under the name DIACRYL 121 by the company AKZO) also containing 40 mg of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile). The solution is then degassed, rendered inert with argon, and then it is poured into a lens-shaped glass mold having a diameter of 8 cm and a thickness of 2 mm. The mold is then placed in an oven at 70°C for 12 h. After removal from the mold, a transparent and rigid lens is obtained. Under solar irradiation, the glass rapidly develops a<br><br>
purple or intense blue coloradon and it again becomes colorless in darkness. The photochromic characteristics are given in Table I below. After 15 min of exposure to a Xenon lamp, the UV-visible spectrum is recorded, and the Xmax values of the two principal bands and their absorbances by Induced Optica! Density (IOD) are measured. The absorbances are also measured .'Aer a 5-min discoloration in darkness.<br>
Structures of compounds 1-9 according to the invention and of Comparative Example CI.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results clearly demonstrate that the compounds of the invention have higher Xmax values (550-610 nm for the second bând and 440-518 nm for the second bând), and most of them display much higher induced optica! density compared to compound CI, having no methoxy groups on the naphthyl ring of the naphthopyran. In addition, it has been observed that the UV Xmax of the compounds according to the invention have undergone a bathochromic shift of approximately 7 nm in comparison to compound CI (382 nm versus 365 nm for compound CI). This shift consequently allows a better sensitivity to the UV radiation of the solar spectrum.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
