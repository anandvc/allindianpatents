CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/984,492 filed on 11/01/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known hybrid powertrain architectures can include multiple<br>
torque-generative devices, including internal combustion engines and non-<br>
combustion machines, e.g., electric machines, which transmit torque through a<br>
transmission device to an output member. One exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which<br>
utilizes an input member for receiving tractive torque from a prime mover<br>
power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a<br>
motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Machines, operative as<br><br>
motors or generators, can generate torque inputs to the transmission<br>
independently of a torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy transmitted through the<br>
vehicle driveline to energy that is storable in an energy storage device. A<br>
control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and<br>
provides operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the power interchange among the energy<br>
storage device and the machines to manage outputs of the transmission,<br>
including torque and rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A powertrain includes an electro-mechanical transmission<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to an internal combustion engine and first<br>
and second electric machines to transmit power to an output member. A<br>
method for controlling the electro-mechanical transmission includes<br>
determining motor torque constraints for the first and second electric<br>
machines, and determining battery power constraints for an electrical energy<br>
storage device. A range for an additional torque input to the electro-<br>
mechanical transmission is determined. A preferred output torque to the<br>
output member of the electro-mechanical transmission is determined that is<br>
achievable within the motor torque constraints and within the range of the<br>
additional torque input and is based upon the battery power constraints.<br>

[0007] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0008] Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>

disclosure; and<br>
[0010] Fig. 5 is an algorithmic flowchart, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br><br>
herein as TI, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA,<br>
and NB, respectively.<br>
[0012] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0013] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br>
C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary<br>
devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of<br>
the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically<br><br>
applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
[0014] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0015] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br><br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed NO and an output<br>
torque TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed,<br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control,<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br><br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0018] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br><br>
[0019] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is signally connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br><br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including<br>
e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and TB for<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions<br>
including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and<br>
generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not<br>
shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br><br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, T|, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed, N\. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br><br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0025] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0026] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br><br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0027] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
[0028] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M1_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('M1_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('G1') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br><br>
[0029] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
torque generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output<br>
member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from<br>
the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque between<br>
the transmission 10 and the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14,<br>
clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of<br>
the transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow, The<br>
commanded output torque can be a tractive torque wherein torque flow<br>
originates in the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 and is transferred through the transmission 10 to the driveline 90, and can<br>
be a reactive torque wherein torque flow originates in the vehicle wheels 93 of<br>
the driveline 90 and is transferred through the transmission 10 to first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 and the engine 14.<br>
[0030] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range<br>
state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br><br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet<br>
the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description<br>
above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br>
[0031] Operation of the engine 14 and transmission 10 is constrained by<br>
power, torque and speed limits of the engine 14, the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, the ESD 74 and the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. The operating constraints on the engine 14 and transmission 10 can be<br><br>
translated to a set of system constraint equations executed as one or more<br>
algorithms in one of the control modules, e.g., the HCP 5.<br>
[0032] Referring again to Fig. 1, in overall operation, the transmission 10<br>
operates in one of the operating range states through selective actuation of one<br>
or two of the torque-transfer clutches. Torque constraints for each of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and speed<br>
constraints for each of the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72, and the output shaft 64 of the transmission 10 are determined. Battery<br>
power constraints for the ESD 74 are determined, and are applied to further<br>
limit the motor torque constraints for the first and second electrical machines<br>
56 and 72. The preferred operating region for the powertrain is determined<br>
using the system constraint equation, based upon the battery power<br>
constraints, the motor torque constraints, and the speed constraints. The<br>
preferred operating region comprises a range of permissible operating torques<br>
or speeds for the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72.<br>
wherein, in this embodiment,<br>
[00331 By deriving and simultaneously solving dynamics equations of the<br>
transmission 10, the torque limit, in this embodiment the output torque TO, can<br>
be determined using the following linear equations:<br><br><br>
TM1 represents the output torque TO at output member 64,<br>
TM2 represents the input torque TI at input shaft 12,<br>
TM3 represents the reactive clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-<br>
transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission<br>
10,<br>
TA to TMI, TA toTM2, TA toTM3 are contributing factors of TA to TM1,<br>
TM2, TM3, respectively,<br>
TB to TM1, TB to TM2, TB to TM3 are contributing factors of TB to TM1,<br>
TM2, TM3, respectively,<br>
Misc_TM1, Misc_TM2, and Misc_TM3 are constants which contribute<br>
to TM1, TM2, TM3 by NI_DOT, NO_DOT, and NC_DOT (time-rate<br>
changes in the input speed, output speed and clutch slip speed)<br>
respectively, and<br>
TA and TB are the motor torques from the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72.<br>
The torque parameters TM1, TM2, TM3 can be any three independent<br>
parameters, depending upon the application.<br>
[0034] The engine 14 and transmission 10 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 have speed constraints, torque constraints, and battery<br>
power constraints due to mechanical and system limitations.<br>
[0035] The speed constraints can include engine speed constraints of NI =<br>
0 (engine off state), and NI ranging from 600 rpm (idle) to 6000 rpm for the<br>
engine 14. The speed constraints for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 can be as follows:<br><br><br>
-10,500 rpm ≤NB≤+10,500 rpm.<br>
[0036] The torque constraints include engine torque constraints including<br>
TI_MIN 
electric machines including TA_MIN 
The motor torque constraints TA_MAX and TA_MIN comprise torque limits for<br>
the first electric machine 56 when working as a torque-generative motor and<br>
an electrical generator, respectively. The motor torque constraints TB_MAX and<br>
TB_MIN comprise torque limits for the second electric machine 72 when<br>
working as a torque-generative motor and an electrical generator, respectively.<br>
The maximum and minimum motor torque constraints TA_MAX, TA_MIN,<br>
TB_MAX, TB_MIN are preferably obtained from data sets stored in tabular format<br>
within one of the memory devices of one of the control modules. Such data<br>
sets are empirically derived from conventional dynamometer testing of the<br>
combined motor and power electronics (e.g., power inverter) at various<br>
temperature and voltage conditions.<br>
[0037] Battery power constraints comprise the available battery power<br>
within the range of PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX, wherein PBAT_MIN is maximum<br>
allowable battery charging power and PBAT_MAX is the maximum allowable<br>
battery discharging power. Battery power is defined as positive when<br>
discharging and negative when charging.<br>
[0038] Minimum and maximum values for TM1 are determined within the<br>
speed constraints, the motor torque constraints, clutch torque constraints, and<br>
the battery power constraints during ongoing operation, in order to control<br>
operation of the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72,<br>
also referred to hereinafter as Motor A 56 and Motor B 72, and the<br><br>
transmission 10 to meet the operator torque request and the commanded<br>
output torque.<br>
[0039] An operating range, comprising a torque output range is<br>
determinable based upon the battery power constraints of the ESD 74.<br>
Calculation of battery power usage, PBAT is as follows:<br><br>
wherein PA,ELEC comprises electrical power from Motor A 56,<br>
PB,ELEC comprises electrical power from Motor B 72, and<br>
PDC_LOAD comprises known DC load, including accessory loads.<br>
[0040] Substituting equations for PA,ELEC and PB,ELEC, yields the following:<br><br>
wherein PA,MECH comprises mechanical power from Motor A 56,<br>
PA,LOSS comprises power losses from Motor A 56,<br>
PB,MECH comprises mechanical power from Motor B 72, and<br>
PB,LOSS comprises power losses from Motor B 72.<br>
[0041] Eq. 5 can be restated as Eq. 6, below, wherein speeds, NA and NB,<br>
and torques, TA and TB, are substituted for powers PA and PB. This includes an<br>
assumption that motor and inverter losses can be mathematically modeled as a<br>
quadratic equation based upon torque as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein NA, NB comprise speeds of Motors A and B 56 and 72,<br>
TA, TB comprise torques of Motors A and B 56 and 72, and<br>
a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 each comprise quadratic coefficients which are<br>
a function of respective motor speeds, NA, NB.<br>
[0043] This reduces to Eq. 8 as follows.<br>
[0044] This reduces to Eq. 9 as follows.<br>
[0042] This can be restated as Eq. 7 as follows.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0045] This reduces to Eq. 10 as follows.<br><br>
[0046] This reduces to Eq. 11 as follows.<br><br><br>
[0047] The motor torques TA and TB can be transformed to Tx and Ty as<br>
follows:<br><br>
wherein TX is the transformation of TA,<br>
TY is the transformation of TB, and<br><br>
A1, A2, B1, B2 comprise application-specific scalar values.<br>
[0048] Eq. 11 can thus be further reduced as follows.<br><br>
[0049] Eq. 12 specifies the transformation of motor torque TA to Tx and<br>
the transformation of motor torque TB to TY. Thus, a new coordinate system<br>
referred to as TX/TY space is defined, and Eq. 13 comprises battery power,<br>
PBAT, transformed into TX/TY space. Therefore, the battery power range<br>
between maximum and minimum battery power PBAT_MAX and PBAT_MIN can be<br>
calculated and graphed as radii RMax and RMin with a center at locus (0, 0) in<br>
the transformed space TX/TY, designated by the letter K as shown with<br>
reference to Fig. 3, wherein:<br><br>
[0050] The minimum and maximum battery powers, PBAT_MIN and<br>
PBAT_MAX, are preferably correlated to battery physics, e.g. state of charge,<br>
temperature, voltage and usage (amp-hour/hour). The parameter C, above, is<br>
defined as the absolute minimum possible battery power at given motor<br>
speeds, NA and NB, within the motor torque limits. Physically, when TA=0 and<br>
TB=0 the output power from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br><br>
is zero. Physically TX= 0 and TY= 0 corresponds to a maximum charging<br>
power for the ESD 74. The positive sign ('+') is defined as discharging power<br>
from the ESD 74, and the negative sign ('-') is defined as charging power into<br>
the ESD 74. RMax defines a maximum battery power, typically a discharging<br>
power, and RMin defines a maximum battery charging power.<br>
[0051] The forgoing transformations to the TX/TY space are shown in Fig.<br>
3, with representations of the battery power constraints as concentric circles<br>
having radii of RMin and RMax ('Battery Power Constraints') and linear<br>
representations of the motor torque constraints ('Motor Torque Constraints')<br>
circumscribing an allowable operating region. Analytically, the transformed<br>
vector [TX TY] determined in Eq. 12 is solved simultaneously with the vector<br>
defined in Eq. 13 comprising the minimum and maximum battery powers<br>
identified by RMin and RMax to identify a range of allowable torques in the<br>
TX/TY space which are made up of motor torques TA and TB constrained by the<br>
minimum and maximum battery powers PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The range of<br>
allowable torques in the TX/TY space is shown with reference to Fig. 3,<br>
wherein points A, B, C, D, and E represent the bounds, and lines and radii are<br>
defined.<br>
[0052] A constant torque line can be defined in the TX/TY space, and<br>
depicted in Fig. 3 ('TM1 = C1'), comprising the limit torque TM1, described in<br>
Eq. 1, above. The limit torque TM1 comprises the output torque TO in this<br>
embodiment, Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 restated in the TX/TY space are as follows.<br><br><br><br>
[0053] Defining TM1_XY, TM2_XY , and TM3_XY as parts of TM1, TM2 and TM3,<br>
contributed by TA and TB only, then:<br><br>
[0054] The following coefficients can be defined:<br><br>
[0055] Thus, Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 are transformed to TX/TY space as follows.<br><br><br>
[0056] The speed constraints, motor torque constraints, and battery power<br>
constraints can be determined during ongoing operation and expressed in<br>
linear equations which are transformed to TX/TY space. Eq. 21 comprises a<br>
limit torque function describing the output torque constraint TM1, e.g., TO.<br>
[0057] The torque limit of the transmission 10, in this embodiment the<br>
output torque To, can be determined by using Eq. 21 subject to the TM2<br>
and TM3 constraints defined by Eqs. 22 and 23to determine a transformed<br>
maximum or minimum limit torque in the TX/TY space, comprising one<br>
of TM1_XYMax and TM1_XYMin, e.g., maximum and minimum output<br>
torques TO_Max and TO_Min that have been transformed. Subsequently the<br>
transformed maximum or minimum limit torque in the TX/TY space can<br>
be retransformed out of the TX/TY space to determine maximum or<br>
minimum limit torques TM1_Max and TM1_Min for managing control and<br>
operation of the transmission 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0058] Fig. 4 shows motor torque constraints comprising the minimum and<br>
maximum motor torques for TA and TB transformed to TX/TY space<br>
('Tx_ Min', 'Tx_Max', 'Ty_Min', 'Ty_Max'). Battery power constraints are<br>
transformed to the TX/TY space ('R_Min', 'R_Max') and have a center locus<br>
point K comprising (Kx, Ky) = (0,0). Constraints comprising maximum and<br>
minimum limits for an additional constraint torque are depicted ('Tm2 =<br>
Tm2_High_Lmt' and 'Tm2 = Tm2_Low_Lmt'), and comprise the range of<br>
input torques TI at input shaft 12 transformed to TX/TY space in this<br>
embodiment and can be mathematically represented by the line TM2_XY<br><br>
described with reference to Eq. 22, above. The lines TM2_XY described in Eq.<br>
22 includes the TM2_Intercept having two different values corresponding to the<br>
maximum limit and the minimum limit for the engine input torque TI.<br>
Alternatively, the second input torque TM2_XY can comprise a range of clutch<br>
torques or another torque input.<br>
[0059] The operating range of the output torque To shown as the lines<br>
representing the maximum limit ('Tm1= -Tx + Ty (max)') and the minimum<br>
limit ('Tm1= -Tx + Ty (min)').<br>
[0060] A constant torque line ('Tm1') representing line TM1_XY has a positive<br>
slope of a/b of the general form in Eq. 24:<br><br>
wherein a  0 and C is a constant term. In the ensuing descriptions,<br>
the line TM1_XY has a positive slope of 1:1 for purposes of illustration. The x-<br>
intercept C of Eq. 24 can change to be one of a minimum or a maximum<br>
torque. Thus, the operating range of output torque TO is shown as the lines<br>
representing the maximum limit ('Tm1= -Tx + Ty (max)') and the minimum<br>
limit ('Tml= -Tx + Ty (min)').<br>
[0061] Fig. 5 depicts a process for determining one of the maximum and<br>
minimum output torques TO_Max and TO_Min based upon the speed constraints,<br>
motor torque constraints, and battery power constraints and constrained within<br>
the range of the additional torque input comprising Tm2. The process<br>
includes determining whether the preferred solution is a maximum value for<br>
the output, i.e., TMI_XYMax as indicated by setting a flag Tm1_Max_Flag, or<br><br>
alternatively whether the preferred solution is a minimum value for the output,<br>
i.e., TM1_XYMin as indicated by not setting the flag Tm1_Max_Flag. A<br>
maximum (or minimum) value for the first torque Tm1 is calculated based<br>
upon the motor torque constraints and battery power constraints in TX/TY<br>
space, comprising one of TM1_XYMax and TM1_ XYMin, and depicted as point<br>
P (or point Q) and having coordinates of (Tx, Ty) on Fig. 4 (502). A value for<br>
the second input torque TM2_XY ('Tm2_Value') is calculated using Eq. 22<br>
(504). It is determined whether the value for the second input torque TM2_XY<br>
('Tm2 Value') is within the operating range of the second input torque, shown<br>
as the lines representing the high limit ('Tm2_High_Lmt') and the low limit<br>
('Tm2_Low_Lmt') (506). When it is determined that the value for the second<br>
input torque TM2_XY (Tm2_Value') is within the operating range of the second<br>
input torque, the maximum (or minimum) value for the first torque Tml<br>
depicted as point P (or point Q) and having the coordinates of (Tx, Ty) is<br>
accepted as the valid answer (518). The (Tx, Ty) point represents the<br>
preferred solution for controlling operation that can be retransformed to motor<br>
torques (TA, TB) to control operation of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72.<br>
[0062] When it is determined that the value for the second input torque<br>
TM2_XY ('Tm2_Value') is less than the operating range of the second input<br>
torque, shown as the line representing the low limit (Tm2_Low_Lmt') as<br>
shown in Fig. 4 (508), the second torque Tm2 is set to the low limit, i.e., Tm2<br>
= Tm2_min is set equal to the line Tm2 = Tm2_Low_Lmt (510), and a search<br>
is conducted to determine a minimum (or maximum) value for the first torque<br>
Tml that is within the motor torque constraints and the battery power<br><br>
constraints and at the low limit (Tm2_Low_Lmt') (514). In any case, the<br>
solution comprises the minimum (or maximum) value for the first torque Tm1<br>
that is within the motor torque constraints and the battery power constraints<br>
and the constraints of the second torque Tm2 (520).<br>
[0063] When it is determined that the value for the second input torque<br>
TM2_XY ('Tm2_Value') is greater than the operating range of the second input<br>
torque, shown as the line representing the high limit ('Tm2_High_Lmt') (508,<br>
512), a search is conducted to determine a maximum (or minimum) value for<br>
the first torque Tm1 that is within the motor torque constraints and the battery<br>
power constraints and at the high limit ('Tm2_High_Lmt') (516). In any case,<br>
the solution comprises the minimum (or maximum) value for the first torque<br>
Tml that is within the motor torque constraints and the battery power<br>
constraints and the constraints of the second torque Tm2 (520).<br>
[0064] The preferred solution for this set of constraints (520) is the solution<br>
that has the lesser Tml point, i.e., the lesser output torque constraint TM1,<br>
when maximizing the output torque or the solution that has the greater Tm1<br>
point, when minimizing the output torque. The solution set preferably<br>
comprises a (Tx, Ty) point representing a preferred solution for controlling<br>
operation that can be retransformed to motor torques (TA, TB) to control<br>
operation of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0065] The embodiment described hereinabove is based upon the line<br>
TM1_XY having a positive slope of a/b of the general form in Eq. 24 (as above):<br><br><br>
wherein a  0 and C is a constant term, with a slope of a/b = 1:1 for<br>
purposes of illustration with the x-intercept C being changeable. The<br>
description is applicable to combinations of a &gt; 0, b 
being less than 1:1 and being greater than 1:1.<br>
[0066] The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment(s)<br>
