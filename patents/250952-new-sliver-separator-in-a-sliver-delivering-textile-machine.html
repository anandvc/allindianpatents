				<td>FIELD OF THE IllVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sliver separator arrangement associated with the textile machine such as card, comber and draw frame. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a sliver separator arrangement to be used in the textile machines so as to provide smooth and effective separation of the sliver delivered from the sliver coiler with less over hanging of the sliver in the can.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The usage of can coiler in the textile spinning preparation machine such as card, comber and Draw frames, for depositing the sliver gently in to the sliver can to facilitate processing by the machine arranged downstream is known. Normally the cans are kept over a revolving table and rotated at a pre-determined speed by the drive system of the textile machine. Like wise the coiler comprising the sliver canal and a bottom surface which constantly rubs the top layers of the slivers deposited in the sliver can is also rotated at a pre determined speed by the drive system of the textile machine. When the sliver can is filled with pre determined length of sliver, then the sliver has to be cut and the filled can is to be replaced with an empty one, which is an essential process in the can changing mechanisms. This process is automatically taking place in modern machines, which are equipped with automatic can changers.<br><br>
Numerous types of positively-driven knives, blades, rolls, combs, shears and the like have heretofore been proposed for cutting, severing, rupturing, or otherwise separating sliver strands delivered by the sliver coiler associated with carding, comber and draw-frame in a textile machine. Such positively-driven devices are necessarily complex in nature, and add significantly to the initial cost and the maintenance expense of the coilers with which they are associated.<br>
US44 97087 describes a sliver separator mounted on the can removal means in a can filling station to engage against the underside of the coiler guide wheel under a spring biased force. Simultaneously with the movement of the full can, the separator slides over the exit opening of the sliver channel in the guide wheel and thus separates or tears the fiber sliver which is stationary and located in the exit opening. But the separator as described in the prior art is movable which makes the system complex and adds significantly to the cost. No separator, which is stationary but yet separates the sliver in the doffed can is described in the prior art.<br>
In a yet another known arrangement of linear can changer a can coiler, which provided with sliver canal to deposit the sliver in a sliver can. The sliver separation unit is fitted to one of the pillar of the coiler. Soon after the can is filled with the preset length of sliver the filled can present underneath the coiler is exchanged with an empty can, which is known as the doffing. After doffing takes place a gripping arm is provided which lifts up and<br><br>
holds the sliver against the coiler plate in the region between the doffed and the empty can which is about to be filled with sliver. A separator is passed through the gripping arm and the sliver is separated. The gripping arm is returned back to its original position after this operation.<br>
The disadvantages with the aforesaid arrangement is that, the sliver overhanging is more in the can, too many components involved leading to the complexity of the arrangement and it is costly due its further need of compressed air and electric power.<br>
Indian patent 17 3539 describes a can coiler with an outlet channel for a sliver is provided, whereby the outlet channel is fastened to a turn table and follows a circular path. Calender rolls for transporting the sliver are arranged before the outlet channel. A stationary sliver cutting device with a cutting element is provided, whereby the cutting element is pivotable, transverse to a longitudinal direction of the sliver, into and away from the circular path of the outlet channel into and away from a transverse groove of the turntable. The cutting element is in the form of a cutting knife with a blade and is supported such that a cutting edge for a cutting process by a pulling cutting action is moved into the circular path whereby the cutting knife, in a cutting position thereof, extends to a radial line of the circular path. The radial line is essentially vertical to the cutting edge. The cutting device ensures a flawless operation, even at high production speeds.<br><br>
The disadvantages with the aforesaid arrangement are that the sliver cutting is inconsistent. Another disadvantage is that the sliver cutter knife breaks during cutting which leads to changing of the knife and thereby adding to the running cost of the arrangement. One more disadvantage of this arrangement is that the sliver overhang in the can and there is also assembly of too many components which adds to the constructional as well as operational complexity of the arrangement. This arrangement also uses compressed air and electric power, which requires .extensive mechanism requirement adding to the overall cost of the arrangement.<br>
Thus there is a need to overcome the disadvantages prevailing in the prior art and there is therefore a need to provide for a sliver separator arrangement to be used in any of the textile machines so as to provide smooth effective separation of the sliver.<br>
The present inventors have found that by way of a unique construction of a stationary sliver separator arrangement which provides compression to the top surface of the filled can along with the sliver and co-operates with the rotation of the empty can in the filling position and increasing delivery speed thereby providing a stretch to the sliver and separating the sliver.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus one object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a stationary sliver separator arrangement attached to the textile machines-<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide sliver separator with lesser number of components thereby making the arrangement cost effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide positive sliver separation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce overhanging of sliver in the can.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to eliminate choking of sliver in the coiler condenser.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a sliver separator arrangement in a textile machine, said arrangement comprising :<br>
cover means of coiler mechanism or can changer, said cover means being located on top of the plurality of can means receiving the slivers-sliver separator being fixed underneath the cover means next to the filling position in coiler mechanism or can changer, wherein the sliver separator provided with middle portion which is substantially rectangular in shape and provided  with  angular  surfaces  /  inclined  surfaces<br><br>
extending on its two longitudinal sides such that the filled can along with the sliver on doffing occupies the delivery position is subjected to appropriate amount of compression, said compression co-operating with the rotation of the empty just placed in the working position separates the sliver.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The empty sliver can is positioned on the can plate present underneath the can coiler. The sliver cans that are employed for the deposition of sliver being provided with a plate like member supported by spring means for receiving the sliver deposited by the textile machine. The spring pressure is so adopted to maintain the coils of the sliver in contact with the coiler plate of the textile machine for proper coiling. The can coiler and the can plate, are operably connected to the drive system of the textile machine and capable of being revolved at the pre determined speed. A counter is provided to monitor the length of sliver to be placed by the can coiler in to the sliver can and provided with means for setting the required length of sliver that is to be deposited in to the sliver can and connected to the control system of the textile machine.<br>
Soon after the pre determined length of sliver is deposited in the sliver can, the filled can is to be replaced with an empty one. During the can change, also known as doffing, the sliver from the sliver canal of the coiler which extends as the top layer of the sliver can is to be separated. Normally this is done with the help of sliver cutting devices, also known as sliver separators.<br><br>
The sliver separator according to the invention capable of being attached to both linear and rotary can changers•<br>
In case of rotary can changer, the filled can (1) is indexed from the can plate (2) from its working position (3) underneath the can coiler (4) arranged in the coiler plate (5) to the delivery position (6). At the same time the empty can (7) from its waiting position (8) is indexed in to its working position (3) underneath the can coiler (4).The sliver separator (9) being fixed to the bottom surface of the coiler plate (5) in the fixing holes (10 )arranged at a pre determined location in the delivery position (6) (referring to figures 1-4).<br>
In case of linear can changer the filled can (1) is pushed from the can plate (2) by the pushing arrangement of the can changing arrangement from its working position (3) underneath the can coiler (4) arranged in the coiler plate (5) to the delivery position (6) . At the same time the empty can (7) from its waiting position (8) is pushed in to its working position (3) underneath the can coiler (4) by the pushing arrangement of the can changing arrangement. The sliver separator (9) being fixed to the bottom surface of the coiler plate (5) in the fixing holes (10) arranged at a pre-determined location in the delivery position (6).<br>
Soon after the can change the sliver is separated due to the fact the top layer of the sliver is held underneath th^ sliver separator (9) against the spring force of the sliver can filled with sliver and the empty can just positioned in<br><br>
the working position being revolved for the deposition of the sliver (referring to figures 1-4).<br>
One embodiment of the present invention describes a sliver separator which is an almost rectangular sheet comprising angular surfaces / inclined surfaces extending on its two longitudinal sides. The angle Al and A2 of the inclined surface with respect to the horizontal plane at the sliver can entry and exit region respectively ranges from 5*^ to 45°, preferably in the range 5° to 15*^' The sliver separator being fastened underneath the coiler plate at the pre determined location for example by means of welding studs attached to the sliver separator with the help of the fasteners which passes through the corresponding passage openings provided in the coiler plate. But this way of fixing does not restrict the scope of the present invention and any other fixing can be adopted. The sliver separator is fixed at a pre-determined location in the delivery position.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
In figures A, 5, 7 and 8 the sliver separator is illustrated in detail. The sliver separator (9) comprises a middle portion (9a) which is substantially rectangular in shape and provided with angular surfaces/inclined surfaces (9b) extending on its two longitudinal sides. The angle Al and A2 of the inclined surface with respect to the horizontal plane (ie. the surface parallel to the middle portion  (9a)  at the sliver can entry and exit region<br><br>
respectively being ranges from 5^ to 45°, preferably in the range 5° to 15°. The angle Al and A2 of the inclined surface determine the height ^H' which has the direct bearing on the holding pressure of the sliver for proper separation. The angle Al and A2 there by the height ^H' can adopted according the process parameter of material being processed by the textile machine. The sliver separator (9) being fastened underneath the coiler plate (5) at the pre determined location for example by means of welding studs (9c) attached to the sliver separator (9) with the help of the fasteners (11) which passes through the corresponding passage openings (10) provided in the coiler plate.<br>
Working of the invention :<br>
The spinning preparatory machines like card, comber and draw frame delivers sliver at the outlet. The sliver is fed through outlet funnel means and fed to the can where the sliver is coiled. As soon as the preset length of sliver is delivered into the can, the full can has to be doffed out and at the same time sliver delivery has to be slowed down to enable smooth doffing process and for placing empty can.<br>
In present invention, the separation of sliver is done by using a stationary sliver separator arrangement as described hereinabove. The sliver in the filled can is held against the Sliver separator by spring force and because of the rotation of the working can (empty can just kept over the can plate for filling) the sliver separation takes place between the doffed can and working can.<br><br>
The invention has been described in a preferred form only and many variations may be made in the invention which will still be comprised within its spirit. The invention is not limited to the details cited above. The projections, inclination angles as herein described do not limit the scope of the present invention and can be replaced by its technical equivalence and yet the invention can be performed. The structure thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all the details may furthermore be replaced with elements having technical equivalence. In practice the materials and dimensions may be any according to the requirements, which will still be comprised within its true spirit.<br><br><br><br>
