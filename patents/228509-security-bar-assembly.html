The present invention relates to an extendable security bar assembly for a window or door opening in a building.<br>
Background Art<br>
There is a requirement for security bars to be used in front of windows and doors and particularly in front of store fronts and the like.  Such security bars are needed to deter break-in attempts into a building.  There are various types of security bars and shutters available some of the shutters are designed for weather protection such as hurricanes as well as security.  Many of these shutters and security bars when raised up are rotated on a drum or alternatively fold into a large cage member positioned above the opening.  One example of a hurricane shutter is that disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,469,905.  This patent shows a series of blades which accordion upwards into a cage or frame.  The main purpose of the shutter is to provide strength against wind, but as a side effect the shutter provides security to prevent intruders from breaking in.<br><br>
The hurricane shutter has heavy blades for weather protection.  There is a requirement for a lighter security system for helping to prevent break-ins.  The system has a plurality of spaced apart horizontal bars with connecting links.  One example of such a system is that disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,095,690 which shows a series of horizontal bars with connecting linkage members.  The bars roll up on a drum. A similar system is shown in U.S. Patent 3,739,832.<br>
If the opening is wide, then the security bars generally have links joining the bars together to prevent the bars being bent to force an opening between bars. However, if the opening is not wide, for example, a small household window, then it is not needed to have links joining the bars together provided they are rigidly held at each end.<br>
When connecting links are not required between bars, one does not have the necessity of folding bars and connecting links but can store the bars in a stored configuration or a container adjacent the opening and arrange to feed each bar to join opposing connecting links of drive chains on opposing faces of the opening so they are positioned and spaced apart for the full opening or a portion of the opening as required.<br><br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to provide an improved extendable security bar assembly which is convenient, aesthetic and less costly than existing devices, one that is used primarily for security.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide a security bar assembly having a plurality of bars extending between two channels, the two channels positioned on opposite faces of the opening, the bars slidable within the channels and having ends of the bars retained in the channels over the opening, at least one bar of the plurality of bars has a connection at each end within each of the two channels to a transporting mechanism in each channel co-ordinated to slide the at least one bar between the two channels, drive means are included for the transporting mechanism to slide the plurality of bars across the opening, and a storage area substantially adjacent the opening, associated with the channels to receive and retain the bars when they are not in place over the opening.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a security bar assembly having bars that move up and down in side channels and when either raised or lowered, the bars and connecting links fold into a folded configuration above or below the opening.  The bars may<br><br>
be moved up and down manually or may be motorized and can lock in any position to prevent accidental lowering.  In the case of a motorized arrangement, safety provisions stop movement of the bars if an object becomes caught in the opening.  Thus the mechanism or the object is not damaged.  It is a further aim to provide guides at the top of the opening or at the bottom of the opening which permits the security bars and the connecting links to fold in an accordion fashion into a space which is smaller than those presently available.  The assembly has a frame comprising the two side channels.  In one embodiment the frame also includes either a bottom plate which fits at the base of the opening or in the case of the folded configuration occurring below the opening, a top plate.  In the case when the folded configuration of bars and connecting links is at the top, the lowest bar is locked adjacent the bottom plate when the security bars are closed to prevent forcing the security bars open.<br>
It is a further aim to provide an emergency escape mechanism so that the security bar assembly can easily be removed from the inside of a building without having to raise or lower the security bars.<br>
The present invention provides a security bar assembly for an opening comprising a plurality of bars extending between two channels, the two channels<br><br>
positioned on opposite faces of the opening, the bars slidable within the channels and having ends of the bars retained in the channels over the opening, at least one bar of the plurality of bars having a connection at each end within each of the two channels to a transporting mechanism in each channel co-ordinated to slide the at least one bar and retain the bars a predetermined distance apart, a drive means for the transporting mechanism, and a storage area substantially adjacent the opening associated with the channels to retain the bars when they are not in place over the opening.<br>
In one embodiment a. plurality of connector links join adjacent bars together and the storage area has guides to receive and guide the bars into a folded configuration with alternate bars on opposite sides.<br>
In another embodiment the two channels have bar drive chains with adjoining chain links guided within the two channels, each of the bars having a connection at each end to engage in chain links in the drive chains, the engaged links spaced apart a predetermined number of chain links in each of the drive chains, and retaining bars a predetermined distance apart.<br>
In a further one embodiment the present invention provides a method of sliding and folding a plurality of horizontal security bars, joined by connector links,<br><br>
across an opening into a storage area, the bars extending between two channels on either side of the opening, comprising the steps of: sliding the plurality of bars in che channels to push a first bar out of the channels into :he storage area; guiding the first bar to one side of :he storage area, sliding the plurality of bars to push an adjacent bar to the first bar out of the channels into :he storage area; guiding the adjacent bar to the other side of the storage area, and continuing sliding the plurality of bars so further bars are guided to one side followed by the other side of the storage area to form a folded configuration.<br>
In yet a further embodiment there is provided a method of forming a security bar assembly in an opening including a plurality of security bars, the bars having retained ends extending between two channels on opposing faces of the opening and slidable therein, comprising the steps of moving drive chains in guides within the two channels, the drive chains having adjoining chain links; feeding opposing retained ends of a first bar to engage in first chain links of the drive chains so the first bar slides across the opening; feeding a second bar to engage in second chain'links spaced a predetermined number of chain links from the first chain links, and continuing moving the drive chains and engaging further bars in further chain links spaced the predetermined number of<br><br>
chain links apart until the security bar assembly covers the opening.<br>
In a still further embodiment there is provided a method of forming a security bar assembly in an opening including a plurality of security bars having retained ends engaged in chain links of drive chains guided in two channels on opposite faces of the opening and slidable therein, comprising the steps of moving the drive chains in guides within the two channels until a first bar having ends engaged in first chain links of the drive chains slides across the opening; continuing moving the drive chains in the guides until a second bar having ends engaged in second chain links of the drive chains slides across the opening, and further moving the drive chains with further bars engaged in further chain links until the security bar assembly covers the opening.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a security bar assembly for an opening comprising a plurality of bars extending between two channels, the two channels positioned on opposite faces of the opening, the bars slidable within the channels and having ends of the bars retained in the channels over the opening; at least one bar of the plurality of bars having a connection at each end within each of the two channels to a transporting mechanism in each channel co-ordinated to slide the at least one bar between the two channels; drive means for the transporting mechanism to slide the plurality of bars across the opening, and storage area substantially adjacent the opening, associated with the channels to receive and retain the bars when they are not in place over the opening.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A security bar assembly 10 is shown in Figure 1 with a plurality of horizontal bars 12 spaced apart by connector links 14, which are interspaced between adjacent bars with connector links 14 for two adjacent bars 12 being interspaced between connector links 14 joined to bars above and below the two adjacent bars. Details of the connector links 14 will be described hereafter.<br>
The ends of each bar 12 are inserted into channels 16 located vertically at the sides of an opening 17 which the security bar assembly 10 covers.  The bottom horizontal bar 12Z has threaded attachments 18 at each<br><br>
end which in turn are connected to threaded shafts 20 in ach channel 16.<br>
The channels 16 are joined at the base to a bottom &gt;late 22 extending below the opening 17.  The bottom &gt;late 22 as well as joining the channels 16 together may &gt;rovide a bottom support for the bottom bar 12Z.  In some ipplications, the bottom plate 22 is omitted and the Lower edge of the opening forms the bottom support.<br>
At the top of the two channels 16 is a space 24 to contain the bars 12 and connecting links 14 when in the raised folded configuration.  First bevel gears 26 at the top of the threaded shafts 20 engage second bevel gears 27 on a connecting shaft 28 having a drive mechanism 30 containing a motor and gears for raising and lowering the assembly 10.  The first bevel gears 26 are above the second bevel gears 27 so they can disengage when the threaded shafts 20 are raised as will be described hereafter.<br>
Figure 2 shows a retaining head 32 on the end of a horizontal bar 12 in the channel 16 which has inward sloping lips 34 to prevent the bar 12 from being pulled out of the channel. The bottom bar 12Z of the assembly may not have retaining heads 32 as this is connected to threaded attachments 18 on the threaded shafts 20. Any attempt to force the bars 12 to come out of the channel<br><br>
16 results in the lips 34 being pushed inward to grip the bar 12 tightly.<br>
The connector links 14 as shown in Figure 1 have a fixed attachment 3 8 at the top end wherein they are rigidly fixed to each bar 12 and a pivoted connection 40 at the bottom end connecting to an adjacent lower bar 12.<br>
Figures 3A to 3F illustrate the bars 12 and connector links 14 folding into a space 24 above the opening.  Figure 3A illustrates the security bar assembly in the fully lowered position with the top bar 12A located at the top of the channel 16.  The assembly is raised by rotating the threaded shafts 20 so that the nut attachments 18 rise upwards and the bottom bar 12Z, pushes the assembly of bars 12 and connector links 14 upwards.  The arrangement shown in Figures 3A to 3F is for the security bar assembly 10 to be mounted on a flat surface and therefore has a flat internal guide 44 and an outside curved guide 46 which extends up from the two sides of the channel 16.  As the top bar 12A moves upwards as shown in Figure 3B, it folds over towards the curved guide 46 of the space 24.  A detent 48 is shown on the flat guide 44 just above the channel 16 to ensure that the top bar 12A does fold towards the curved guide 46.  Figure 3C shows the second bar 12B being pushed straight upwards to rest against the flat guide 44. Figure 3D shows the third bar 12C being pushed over<br><br>
towards curved guide 46 and Figure 3E shows the fourth bar 12D being pushed up against the flat guide 44. Figure 3F shows the fifth bar 12E being pushed towards the curved guide 46.  As the bottom bar 12Z forces the assembly upwards, alternate bars are directed to the curved guide 46 followed by the flat guide 44 to provide a folded configuration.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of a space 24 for the folded configuration having two curved guides 46.  This arrangement would not be suitable for mounting flush against a wall but may be built integrally into a building.  The folded configuration will apply in the same manner as that shown in Figures 3A to 3F.<br>
In another embodiment of the security bar assembly, as shown in Figures 5A to 5F, provision is made for the plurality of bars 12 and connector links 14 to be lowered into a folded configuration below the opening.  At least one of the ends of connector links 14 have a pivoted connection to a bar 12, both ends may have pivoted connections,<br>
Figure 5A illustrates the bottom bar 12Z entering the folding space 24, it reaches the bottom of the space 24 in Figure 5B and in Figure 5C the next bar 12Y commences to fold away from the flat guide 44 towards the curved guide 46.  Figure 5D shows the connector link 14<br><br>
between the bars 12Z and 12Y flat on the bottom of the olding space.  Figures 5E and 5F show the bars 12 and connector links forming into the folded configuration as the bars 12 are lowered.<br>
Figure 6 shows another embodiment of a folding space 24 below the opening with two curved guides 46 similar to the arrangement shown in Figure 4 for a folded configuration above the opening.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the mechanism on the guides 44,46 to ensure that the bars 12 follow a folding configuration as illustrated in Figures 3A to 3F and do not jam up when either the bar assembly 10 is raised or lowered in the channels 16.  Figure 7 illustrates a partial front view of the curved guide 46 having a vertical groove 50 along each of the channels 16.  The retaining head 32 at the end of each bar 12 has an engagement portion 52 as illustrated in Figure 8 at one side which engages in the groove 50 commencing on the curved guide 46 at the position where the top bar 12A contacts the curved guide 46 as shown in Figure 3C.  The groove 50 commences at the approximate position Where the top bar 12A first touches the curved guide 46.  The engagement portion 52 on the end of the retaining head 32 as shown in Figures 7 and 8 prevents the bars 12 from twisting away from a horizontal position and prevents jamming during the raising and lowering of the bars 12.<br><br>
Because the connector links 14 have a fixed end 3 8 attached to the bars 12, the engagement portion 52 is positioned opposite the projecting connector link 14 so that it is guided into the groove 50.  When further bars 12 are raised and the connecting link 14 becomes substantially horizontal, the engagement portion 52 on the next retaining head 32 is guided into the groove 50. Thus the engagement portions 52 on both sides are guided into appropriate grooves 50 in the curved guide 46 and the flat guide 44.  When unfolding, the engagement portion 52 on the lowest bar 12 pulls out of the groove 50 and the next bar 12 takes its place.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the threaded nut attachment 18 on the threaded shaft 20 attached to the bottom bar 12Z.  As can be seen the bottom bar 12Z is attached to the underside of the nut 18 so that in the lowest position the bottom bar 12Z is flush with the bottom plate 22.  The threaded shaft 20 has a bottom shoulder 60 with a smaller diameter lower portion 62 extending downwards through a hole 64 in the bottom plate 22.  At the top of the threaded shaft 20 is top shoulder 66 which joins to an upper portion 68 having a smaller diameter that passes through a hole 70 in a plate 72 at the top of the channel 16.  At the top of the upper portion 68 is a bevel gear 26 which meshes with a second bevel gear 27 on the connecting shaft 28.  A spring 74 is positioned around the upper shaft portion 68 between the<br><br>
top shoulder 66 and the plate 72.  When the bottom bar L2Z reaches the bottom and rests against bottom plate 22 or hits an obstruction and cannot move further down, then at least one of the two threaded shafts 20 rises upwards as illustrated in Figure 10 and this in turn disengages at least one of the bevel gears 26 and 27 so that at least one of the shafts 20 no longer rotates.  A limit switch 76 is shown which cuts off the power to the motor when one of the threaded shafts 20 is raised and the bevel gears 26 and 27 disengage in order to stop rotation of both shafts 20.  Thus the mechanism prevents the bars being lowered if there is an obstruction in the opening or alternatively when the bottom bar 12Z reaches the bottom of the opening 17.  Whereas this arrangement illustrates the bars being raised to a folded configuration above the opening, the same mechanism maybe reversed and used when the folded configuration is below the opening.<br>
Utilizing the mechanism shown in Figures 9 and 10 there is provided a collar 80 adjacent the top of the threaded shafts in the channel 16 below the guides 44 and 46 as shown in Figure* 11.  When the lowest threaded attachment 18 can no longer move downwards, the threaded shaft 20 is raised upwards and the collar 80 pivots a lever arm 82 which has lower engagement end 84 that passes through an opening 86 in the channel 16.  This engagement end 84 is positioned to stop an adjacent<br><br>
horizontal bar 12 from being raised.  Thus the locking mechanism acts as a further security if for instance the bottom bar 12Z was broken or the connector links 14 severed then it would still not be possible to push the remaining bars 12 upwards because the engagement end 84 stops the next bar 12 from moving up, and the connector links 14 support the other bars 12 in their spaced relationship.  This mechanism works in the same way when the folded configuration is below the opening, except the threaded shafts 20 move down when the highest threaded attachment 18 can no longer move up.<br>
In another configuration as shown in Figures 12 and 13, provision is made for quick release of the complete frame containing the security bar assembly from the side of a building.  Figure 12 illustrates mounting plates 90 attached to the wall surface 92 adjacent the opening. The plates 90 are located between the channels 16 and the wall surface 92 of a building.  The mounting plate 90 is attached to the wall surface 92 by a number of wall screws 93 or other types of attachments and has a series of studs 94 which extend out with enlarged heads 96.  As shown in Figure 13, a series of elongated slots 98 with wider top portions 100 are provided in one side of the channels 16, and the slots 98 fit over the studs 94.  A wedge 102 is positioned under each channel supported by a fixed member 104.  The wedge holds the channels 16 at a height such that the enlarged heads 96 of the studs 94<br><br>
are level with the slots 98 below the wider top portions. When the wedge is removed, and this is done by a quick release lever mechanism (not shown) the channels 16 drop down and the complete security bar assembly may be moved clear of the wall surface with the enlarged heads 96 of the studs 94 passing through the wider top portions 100 of the slots 98.  In another configuration, a hinge 106 is provided at one side of the assembly.  The hinge 106 permits the assembly 10 to be swung open.  This quick release mechanism for the security bar assembly 10 is for a fire escape or an emergency escape from a building particularly if there is power failure and one is not able to raise the bars 12.<br>
In operation the bars 12 are kept in horizontal positions at all times.  When there are in the folded configuration, it is essential that they retain their horizontal position to prevent tipping or falling to one side which causes the mechanism to jam.   The engagement portion 52 on the retaining head 32 of bar 12 aids in preventing tipping from occurring.  When the bars are lowered, the bevel gears 2 6,27 disengage, because the two threaded shafts 20 have lifted, and at the same time the locking mechanism as shown in Figure 11 is engaged to lock one of the top bars 12.  To raise the bars, the gears 2 6,27 are reversed and as they engage each other, the threaded shafts 20 lower, so the collar 80 allows the lever arm 82 to pivot downwards disengaging the<br><br>
engagement end 84 from openings 86 in the channels 16 and the bars 12 move upwards into the storage area 24 to form the folded configuration as illustrated in Figures 3A to 3F.  The reverse operation occurs when the folded configuration is below the opening.<br>
The rotation of the two threaded shafts 20 is shown in Figure 1 by means of a connecting shaft 28 and bevel gears 26,27 driven by a motor 30 or by a crank handle 31 for manual operation.  In another embodiment there may be two synchronized motors each driving a threaded shaft 20. In a still further embodiment there may be a manual mechanism for rotating the threaded shafts 20, such a manual mechanism is synchronized so that both threaded shafts 20 rotate together to keep the bars substantially horizontal.  The raising and lowering of the bar assembly is achieved by rotating the threaded shafts 20.  When the threaded attachment 18 can no longer move downwards because it is at the bottom or if there is an obstruction preventing the bottom bar 12Z from moving down, then at least one of the threaded shafts 20 rises up disengaging the bevel gears 26,27, and tripping the limit switch 70 so the motor 30 is turned off/ When the threaded shafts 20 rise up, the top locking mechanism as shown in Figure 12 is activated so that the upper bars 12 cannot be moved until after the locking mechanism is disengaged.<br><br>
The horizontal bars 12 themselves together wittt tne connector links 14 may be made in modular units as shown in Figure 14 with the bars 12 formed of internal rods 110 and sleeves 112 which are used to space connector links 14 apart.  The rods 110 have a retaining head 32 at one end and a removable retaining head 32A at the other end with tongues 114 that engage with slots 116 in the adjacent sleeve 112.  The connector links 14 are shown having one fixed connection 30 at one end of a bar 12 and having a pivoted connection 40 at the other end.  In another embodiment the connector links 14 may have two pivoted ends.  By having modular units of different sizes and lengths, security bar assemblies may be made up to cover any specific size opening and be foldable into a storage area 24 positioned above the opening.<br>
In another embodiment, the security bar assembly 10 as shown in Figure 15 has a plurality of bars 12 spaced apart by connecting links 14 which are interspaced between adjacent bars 12.  The ends of each bar 12 are inserted into channels 16 which have a drive chain 120 which moves on a first sprocket 122 and a second sprocket 124.<br>
Figure 16 shows a section of a security bar assembly 10 positioned in front of an opening 17 in a wall surface 92.  A storage area such as a container 126 is shown above the opening 17 and folded security bars 12 with<br><br>
connecting links 14 are shown in the container 126. Figure 17 shows a similar sectional view of a security bar assembly to that shown in Figure 16, the difference being that the container 126 is positioned below the opening 17.<br>
Details of the drive chain 120 are shown in Figure 18 rotating about the second sprocket 124 which has an axis of rotation projecting from the wall substantially perpendicular to the bars 12.  Each bar 12 has at either end a projection 32 which passes through a side slot 128 in the side of the channel 16 as shown in Figure 19.  The projection 32 has a disk member 130 to retain the end of the bar 12 within the channel 16 and has an end piece 132 that extends to engage in an aperture of a chain link 134 of the drive chain 120.  A chain guide 136 in a lower channel member 13 8 shown in Figure 18 acts to direct the drive chain 120 away from the sprocket 124 so that the end piece 132 of each of the bars 12 does not interfere with the teeth of the sprocket 124.  The channels 16 are held to the wall beside the opening 17 by bolts 140 and a snap-on cover 142, shown in Figure 19, extends over the channel 16.  As the channel 16 is preferably placed on the inside of the building, the cover 142 can only be reached from the inside.<br>
Whereas Figures 18 and 19 show the drive chains 12 0 with sprocket axes substantially at right angles to the<br><br>
bars 12, in another embodiment the sprocket axes may be substantially parallel to the bars 12.  In this case a chain link plate (not shown) extends from the side of a chain link 134 to engage an end of the bar 12.<br>
Whereas Figure 15 shows connecting links 14 between bars 12, Figure 20 is a perspective view showing a security bar assembly with bars 12 and no connecting links joining the bars 12 together.  This is possible because each bar is individually held in a chain link. The connector links 14 are not essential because the opening is not too wide and the bars 12 cannot easily be pried apart.  Figures 21, 22 and 23 illustrate one embodiment of a mechanism for the shutter assembly shown in Figure 20.  The drive chain 120 as shown in Figure 21 rotates on the first sprocket 122 which is an eight tooth drive sprocket having one tooth missing.  Every time the first sprocket 122 rotates and the missing tooth is open, the end piece 132 of the projection 32 from each bar 12 engages in a connection aperture in the chain link 134 and is then conveyed across the opening as the drive chain 120 moves around the sprocket 122.  The missing tooth on the sprocket 122 is shown more clearly in Figure 22 with the end piece 132 engaging in the chain link 134 of the drive chain 120.  The first sprocket 122 rotates on axle 144 which in turn is driven by a driven bevel gear 146.  A drive shaft 28 shown in Figure 1 extends across the opening between the two drive chains 120.<br><br>
While not shown, the drive shaft 28 is driven by a gear motor that can rotate in either direction to slide the bars 12 across the opening.  On either end of the drive shaft is a drive bevel gear 150 that engages the driven bevel gear 146 on the axle 144 to drive the first sprocket 122.  Thus, rotation of the drive shaft 28 rotates both first sprockets 122 on either side of the opening in the channels 16 and moves the chains 120 at exactly the same speed so that the bars 12 remain substantially evenly spaced apart when they are engaged in individual chain links of the drive chain 120.<br>
An escapement wheel 152 is attached to the drive bevel gear 150 and has a notch 154 to engage the projection 32 of a bar 12.  Initially the bars 12 are stored in a stored configuration which in the embodiment shown is a container 126 above the opening and positioned above the cross shaft 28.  Guides 156 direct the bars 12 into a slot 158 where they individually fall.  As the escapement wheel 152 rotates the projection 32 of the first bar 12 is engaged by the notch 154 which moves the bar 12 down until the end piece 132 of the bars 12 engages in the connection aperture of the chain link 134 that is positioned on the sprocket 122 at the location where the tooth is missing.  This applies for both sprockets 122 for both drive chains 120 on either side of the opening.  As the drive chains 120 move downward, the projections 32 of the bars 12 fit into the slots 128 of<br><br>
the channels 16.  The escapement wheel 152 continues to rotate until it picks up a second bar 12 and lowers that in the slots 128 of the channels 16, at the same time each end piece 132 of the bars 12 fits into a connection aperture of a chain link at the missing tooth position on the sprocket 122.  This continues until all of the bars 12 are spaced apart across the opening 17.  For an eight tooth sprocket 122, the end piece 132 will engage in every eighth chain link.  In one embodiment an eight tooth drive sprocket with one tooth missing provides 4" (10.16 cm) spacing for the bars.  In a further embodiment the speed of the drive chain represents 2" (5.08 cm) per second both up and down.<br>
When raising the bars, the drive chain moves in the opposite direction as does the escapement wheel 152.  The notch 154 in the escapement wheel 152 picks up the projections 32 of each bar 12 and disengages the end piece 132 from the drive chain 120.  The bar 12 is raised and pushed into the container 126 pushing other bars upwards.  The container 126 is preferably lined with soft material to reduce the noise of the bars 12.  As the bars 12 move upwards they spread out to take up the space of the container 126.<br>
Whereas the mechanism shown in Figures 21, 22 and 23 illustrates the container 126 being on top of the opening, in another embodiment the container 12 6 may be<br><br>
positioned below the opening.  The same mechanism as is illustrated would be used for feeding individual horizontal bars 12 to engage with the chain 120. However, there is a spring mechanism (not shown) provided to push each horizontal bar 12 up to ensure that each of the projections 32 engages in the notch 154 of the escapement wheel 152.<br>
In further embodiments, the security bar assembly-may have the bars 12 substantially vertical, with the channels 16 and drive chains 120 at top and bottom.  In this configuration, the engagement of the bars 12 in the drive chains 120 does not rely on gravity.<br>
When connecting links 14 join the bars together, the escapement wheel is not essential providing the first bar 12 is always retained in a chain link 134 of the drive chain 120.  The sprocket with one tooth missing only allows the end piece 132 of a bar 12 to engage where that sprocket tooth is missing.  With the mechanism shown in Figure 18, a chain guide 136 directs the drive chain 120 out from the lower sprocket 124 so that the sprocket teeth do not interfere with the end piece 132 of 'the bar 12 engaging in a chain link 134 of the drive chain 120. In this mechanism other spacing arrangements are provided.  In one embodiment plugs 160 such as that shown in Figure 18, are positioned in each of the so-called connection apertures or spaces in the chain links 134,<br><br>
thus avoiding the necessity of an escapement mechanism. The plugs 160 are preferably made of plastic and move with the chain links 134, thus preventing the end pieces 132 of the bars 12 engaging in a chain link 134.  By placing the plugs 160 in every chain link except in chain links which are engaged by end pieces 132 of bars 12, the bars 12 are spaced apart the predetermined distance.<br>
Another embodiment to maintain the predetermined distance apart is shown in Figure 24.  In this embodiment, the storage area, which is shown as a container 126 to retain the bars 12 is positioned below the opening under the second sprocket 124.<br>
The sprocket 124 is a truncated sprocket, that is to say, a sprocket with the tips of the teeth 124A removed. By having truncated teeth, the end pieces 132 of the bars<br>
12	do not interfere with the truncated teeth 124A.<br>
Whereas a truncated sprocket is shown for this embodiment, a sprocket with a missing tooth as shown in Figure 21 may be used or, alternatively, chain guides<br>
13	6, as shown in Figure 18 may be used to move the chain<br>
away from the sprocket.<br>
Flexible connection spacers 170 are shown attached to the projections 32 at each end of all the bars 12. The spacers determine the predetermined distance between<br><br>
the bars 12 when they are across the opening, but fold so the bars are adjacent each other.  One configuration of folding is shown in Figure 24 when the bars are moved across the opening into the container 126 so they are able to nestle up to each other.  When the first bar 12, which is-never disengaged from the drive chains 120, moves up, the spacers 170 pull the adjacent bar behind it to engage in chain links of the drive chains 120.<br>
In Figures 25, 26 and 27, another embodiment is shown which has a second set of drive chains referred to as storage drive chains 180.  These storage drive chains 180 are positioned in line with the bar drive chains 120 either adjacent the first sprocket 122 positioned above the opening or positioned adjacent the second sprocket 124 below the opening.  In the embodiments shown, the sprockets are all truncated sprockets as shown in Figure 24, so the sprocket teeth do not interfere with the connections between the drive chains and the bars 12. The bars 12 have projections 32 at each end to fit in side slots 128 of the channels 16 as shown in Figure 19. Disk members 130 on the ends of the projections 32 have elongated anchors 182 which have four protrusions 184 in line to engage in apertures of adjacent chain links.  As shown in Figure 27, the anchors 182 have a width less than half the width of the space between link plates in the chain link, and the anchors are arranged to overlap<br><br>
so that adjacent bars 12 have anchors offset so that the bars can be retained together when in the container 126.<br>
In Figure 25 the bars 12 are shown spaced apart with a first bar having the anchor 182 spanning between the bar drive chain 120 and the storage drive chain 180. When the bars 12 are moved into storage, the bar drive chain 120 moves the anchor 182 so that it engages with the storage drive chain 180, this chain is driven intermittently and it moves just sufficient for the top anchor 182 to clear the bar drive chain 120.  Then, as shown in Figure 26 the next bar 12 is moved up and the anchor 182 of the lower bar overlaps the anchor 182 of the first bar so the two bars 12 nestle together.  Thus, when the bars are stored they are all nestled together on the storage drive chain 180.<br>
To lower or raise the bars 12, depending upon whether the storage drive chain 180 is positioned above or below the opening, the storage drive chain 180 moves intermittently feeding the bars so the anchors 182 engage into the continuously moving bar drive chain 120.  The intermittent movement of the storage drive chain 180 is arranged to ensure that the space between bars, i.e., the number of chain links, is always the same across the opening.<br><br>
Figure 28 is a schematic perspective view of the drive mechanism for the bar drive chain 120 and the storage drive chain shown in Figures 25 and 26.  An intermediate gear 190 meshes with a continuous drive gear 192 to drive the first or second sprockets 122,124 of the bar drive chain.  An intermittent drive gear segment 194 is formed integral with the intermediate gear 190 and drives an intermittent drive gear 196 which drives the storage drive chain 180.  An intermittent lock wheel 198 is keyed to the intermediate gear 190 and has a cutout 200 which is positioned above the intermittent drive gear segment 194.  A locking dog 202 is attached to the intermittent drive gear 196 and only permits the intermittent drive gear 196 to rotate when the intermittent drive gear segment 194 meshes with the intermittent drive gear 196.  At all other times the intermittent gear locking dog 202 cannot rotate as it is prevented by the periphery of the locking wheel 198.<br>
The drive mechanism as described may be a gear drive motor to rotate the drive shaft 28.  In a preferred embodiment a brake is included with the motor so the bars 12 cannot be shifted when the power is off.  In another embodiment a manual rotating crank arm (not shown) may be provided so that if there is power failure the bars 12 can be either lowered or raised manually simply by rotating the drive shaft 28.<br><br>
Furthermore, for emergencies, a clutch or release pin may be included between the gear drive motor and the drive shaft 2 8 to disengage the gear motor from the drive shaft 28.  This allows the bars 12 to be pushed up or down as the drive chains move freely.  The drive chains 120 rotate on the sprockets 122,124 and when each horizontal bar comes to the ends of the drive chains 12 it disengages from the drive chain 120 and either falls onto the floor or, alternatively, is guided into a container depending upon the particular embodiment provided, thus providing an escape opening for an emergency.  The security bar assembly is preferably placed on the inside of a building as intruders are not easily able to get at the operating mechanism.<br>
Figure 29 shows a security bar assembly wherein the ends of the bars 12 are connected together with a pivotal sliding bar attachment 210 that can have a single pin assembly for connecting to a chain link 134 as shown in Figure 18, or may have multiple connections similar to that shown in Figures 25 and 26.  This permits the bars 12 to be zig-zagged across the opening.<br>
Whereas the drive chains 120 shown in the other Figures have been shown rotating about first sprocket 122 second sprocket 124 in Figure 3 0 there is shown a drive chain 120A which is not endless.  A single drive sprocket 122A is positioned at the top of the channel 16 and the<br><br>
drive chain 120A has the end pieces 132 of the bar permanently attached to chain links 134 spaced a predetermined number of links apart.  The sprocket 122A is a truncated sprocket so the teeth do not interfere with the end pieces 132 of the bars 12.  When the bars 12 are moved up into the storage area 126 the intermediate chain links of the drive chain 12OA fold up as shown in Figure 30, so the bars 12 are stored as close together as possible.  The sprocket 122A pulls the drive chain 120A down feeding the bars 12 across the opening and provided the spacing between the bars 12.<br>
