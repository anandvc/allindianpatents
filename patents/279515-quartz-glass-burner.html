				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]    The present invention relates to a quartz glass burner.    In particular, the present invention relates to a quartz glass burner suitable for use in flame working, manufacturing of synthetic quartz glass, and the like.    The present application claims priority from a Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-053215 filed on February 28, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, if applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A quartz glass burner can achieve high temperatures by feeding a supporting gas from an inner tube nozzle into an outer tube containing a combustible gas to ignite the combustible gas, and is therefore used for various types of flame working. When using a burner in which a plurality of tubules serving as nozzles are inserted throughout the outer tube, in addition to feeding a supporting gas from an inner tube nozzle into an outer tube containing a combustible gas to ignite the combustible gas, a gas containing pieces of glass is fed through any of the tubules to achieve flame hydrolysis, thereby synthesizing the quartz glass microparticles.<br>
[0003] Fig. 4 shows a conventional quartz glass burner. In Fig. 4, the quartz glass burner is provided with a quartz glass outer tube, a tubule branching portion, and a multibranched-tube quartz glass nozzle that is positioned on an inner side of an outer tube and that houses a plurality of tubules formed continuously along the tubule branching portion.<br>
[0004] Conventionally, the positioning and number of nozzles feeding the supporting gas in this type of quartz glass burner is considered in an attempt to enhance the firepower during flame working and increase the glass microparticle deposition efficiency. [0005] For example. Patent Document 1 designates the positioning and number of nozzles in order to enhance the glass microparticle synthesizing efficiency and deposition efficiency. In Patent Document 2, the diameter and speed of the nozzle is designated. [0006] However, optimizing the supply of gas from the nozzles is not the only way to enhance the flame working efficiency and the deposition efficiency. It is also important to optimize the supply of gas from the outer tube. A flow velocity distribution often occurs in the supply of gas from the outer tube due to the large area through which the gas<br>
<br>
flows, such that the flow velocity at the tip of the burner is uneven.    This causes a<br>
temperature irregularity, which decreases the flame working efficiency and the deposition<br>
efficiency.    This temperature irregularity is especially prominent when enlarging the<br>
diameter of the outer tube to enlarge the flame.<br>

Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2003-165737<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]    It is an object of the present invention to provide a quartz glass burner that<br>
enhances the firepower during flame working and increases the glass microparticle<br>
deposition efficiency by causing the flow velocity distribution of the gas supplied from<br>
the outer tube to be uniform at the tip of the burner.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0008]   So as to solve the above-described problems, as a first embodiment of the<br>
present   invention,   provided  is   a  quartz   glass   burner  characterized  by   having  a<br>
multibranched-tube quartz glass nozzle made up of multiple tubules housed in a quartz<br>
glass outer tube, and by having an inner diamclcr- of the outer tube contracted such that an<br>
inner diameter of a tip of the outer tube is between 0.65 and 0.90 times the inner diameter<br>
of a trunk of the outer tube.<br>
[0009]    It is desirable that the nozzle is structured such that a region from a tubule<br>
branching portion to a tip of the nozzle is housed in the outer tube, and that the outer tube<br>
housing the tubules has a length that is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the inner<br>
diameter of the tip of the outer tube.<br>
[0010]      The summary clause does not necessarily describe all necessary features of the<br>
embodiments  of the  present  invention.      The  present  invention  may  also   be   a<br>
sub-combination of the features described above.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The quartz glass burner of the present invention decreases the temperature irregularity of the flame working and the deposition body surface by causing the flow velocity distribution of the combustible gas to be uniform at the tip of the outer tube of the burner.    Decreasing the temperature irregularity in this way yields favorable results,<br>
<br>
such as enhancement of the firepower during flame working and enhancement of the glass microparticle deposition efficiency.<br>

burner showing an exemplary quartz glass burner of the present invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]    As follows, an aspect of the present invention is described by embodiments.<br>
The following embodiments do not limit the invention that relates to the claims and not<br>
all combinations of the features described in the embodiments are necessarily essential to<br>
means for solving the problems of the invention.<br>
[0014]    Fig. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view taken along a vertical axis of the<br>
burner showing an exemplary quartz glass burner of the present invention.    Fig, 2 is a<br>
horizontal cross-sectional view showing the quartz glass burner of Fig. 1.<br>
[0015]    The quartz glass burner is designed for flame working of synthetic quartz glass.<br>
An outer tube 1 of the quartz glass burner houses a multibranched-tube nozzle 3, which is<br>
made up of a plurality of tubules mounted on a tubule branching portion 2.    A hydrogen<br>
gas injector 4 that injects hydrogen gas, serving as the combustible gas, is connected to<br>
the outer tube 1.    An oxygen gas injector 5 that injects oxygen gas, serving as the<br>
supporting gas, is connected to the tubule branching portion 2 on which the plurality of<br>
tubules are mounted.<br>
[0016]    This   burner  can  be   used   as   a  burner  for  synthesizing/depositing   glass<br>
microparticles by connecting a glass injecting tube, not shown, to any of the tubules.<br>
[0017]   As shown in Fig. 1, the inner diameter of the outer tube 1 decreases gradually<br>
from B to A beginning at the contracted portion 6 at the tip.    More specifically, the inner<br>
diameter of the outer tube tip is decreased to be between 0.65 and 0.90 times the inner<br>
diameter of the trunk of the outer tube.<br>
<br>
[0018] If this contraction ratio is greater than 0.90, the flow velocity distribution is not uniform at the tip of the outer tube because sufficient pressure is not applied during the ejection of the gas, thereby causing a decrease in the flame working efficiency. If the quartz glass burner is configured to be able to supply glass to any one of the tubules in order to synthesize the glass microparticles, the temperature of the deposition surface decreases, thereby decreasing the adhesive efficiency of the synthesized glass microparticles. If the contraction ratio is less than 0.65, a greater enhancement of flame working efficiency and adhesion efficiency is not achieved since sufficient pressure is already being applied, and also the outer diameter of the outer tube is enlarged and therefore requires a larger space than allowed by the apparatus.<br>
[0019] Contracting the tip of the outer tube in this way enables sufficient pressure to be applied at the contracted portion, even if the tip of the outer tube is enlarged. As a result, the flow velocity distribution of the combustible gas is uniform at the tip of the outer tube, thereby decreasing the temperature irregularity of the flame working surface and the deposition surface. The decrease in the temperature irregularity results in enhanced firepower during flame working and enhanced glass microparticle deposition efficiency.<br>
Furthermore, a more uniform flow velocity distribution can be achieved by setting the length of the outer tube to be greater than or equal to 1.5 times the diameter of the tip of the outer tube. [0020]    (First Embodiment Example)<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, one nozzle is disposed in the center of the outer tube for the supporting gas, this nozzle is surrounded with six other nozzles, and the inner diameter of the tip of the outer tube to be 25mm(p. Quartz glass burners were manufactured with the above specifications and a large variety of contraction ratios by changing the inner diameter of the trunk of the outer tube.<br>
[0021] These quartz glass burners having diifering contraction ratios were used for flame working of a quartz glass rod having an outer diameter of 60mm(p. Each of the seven tubules forming the nozzle may be disposed parallel to the central axis of the burner or mounted in the outer tube in a manner to come together at a focal point at a desired position lengthwise on the central axis.<br>
[0022] While measuring the surface temperature of a flame working section of each of the burners with a radiation thermometer, the amounts of the gases fed through the outer tube and the nozzle was changed for each burner to achieve the maximum surface temperature. The resulting relation between the contraction ratios and the maximum temperatures is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
<br>
[0023] As shown in Fig. 3, when the contraction ratio A/B is greater than 0.90, the surface temperature decreases, which also decreases the thermal efficiency. This drop occurs because insufficient contraction results in a large flow velocity distribution of the combustible gas at the tip of the outer tube. On the other hand, when the contraction ratio is less than or equal to 0.65, greater efficiency is not expected since there is already sufficient contraction. Furthermore, when the contraction ratio is 0.65 and the internal diameter of the tip contracted portion is set to 25mm(p, the inner diameter of the trunk of the outer tube becomes 38mmφ, which is undesirable as it requires a space greater than the apparatus can allow.<br>
[0024] While the embodiments of the present invention have been described, the technical scope of the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments. It is apparent to persons skilled in the art that various alterations and improvements can be added to the above-described embodiments. It is also apparent from the scope of the claims that the embodiments added with such alterations or improvements can be included in the technical scope of the invention.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0025] The quartz glass burner of the present invention is beneficial when used for flame working or manufacturing of synthetic quartz glass, and provides low manufacturing costs and enhanced quality.<br>
