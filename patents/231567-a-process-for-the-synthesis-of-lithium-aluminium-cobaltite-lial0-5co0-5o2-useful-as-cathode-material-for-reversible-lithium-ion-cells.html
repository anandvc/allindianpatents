				<td>The present invention relates to the novel process for the preparation of lithium aluminium cobaltite as a useful cathode material for lithium cells.<br>
This present invention relates to the preparation of lithium aluminium cobaltite (LiAlo.5 Coo.5 O2) a composite, which is very useful for high voltage lithium reversible cells and can be prepared by mixing oxides of aluminium, cobalt with lithium hydroxide by heating together all in solid state condition. LiAlo.5Coo.5 O2 is a reversible cathode material useful for high voltage cells of lithium in nonaqueous media. LiAlo.5Coo.5O2 compound is hexagonal material is well known from 1995 as a good battery cathode for reversibility in nonaqueous solutions. This compound can be prepared from LiOH, Co3O4 and A1(OH)3 plus a small amount of A1(NO3)3 were mixed and heated in air first at 550°C for 20 hrs and then at 750°C for 24 hrs. [H.Huang et al, J.Power Sources, 81-82 (1992)690].<br>
This compound can be alternatively obtained by Co-precipitation and freeze drying technique, in which an aqueous solutions of A1(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2 and LiNO3 were mixed together. Then the mixture was fired for 2 hrs at 700-800°C in air or oxygen [Y.I Jang, B.Huang, Wang, G R Maskaly and H.Tamura, J.Power sources 81-82 (1999)589].<br>
In all the above procedures available in the literature some disadvantages were observed. They areas follow:<br>
Phase impurity<br>
Longer duration of thermal preparation<br>
High temperature of operation<br>
pH control<br>
Several steps of preparation<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a process for synthesis of lithium aluminum cobaltite (LiAlo.5 Coo.5 O2) under novel reaction method which obviates the defects and draw backs hither to known in other methods of preparation of this compound from already known procedures in literatures.<br>
Another object of this present invention is to formulate a new procedure for the synthesis of a thermal procedure for the synthesis of LiAlo.5 Coo.5 O2) cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells which obviate the draw backs of the known method. Further object of this invention in the cyclability of the system by retaining in the cathode &amp; replacing a part of it by Aluminum.<br>
Still another object is to use glycerol as a binding agent that make a uniform homogeneous mixture which permits uniform reaction to occur without any side reaction. Yet another object of this invention is to prepare LiAlo.5 Coo.5 O2with various oxide of aluminum and cobalt and hydroxide of lithium.<br>
8. According the present invention relates to a A process for the synthesis of lithium aluminum cobaltite (LiAlo.5 Coo.5O2) useful as cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells which comprises preparing a paste by mixing hydroxide of lithium with oxide of aluminum and cobalt in the ratio of Li: Al: Co as 1: 1/2: 1/2 by wt. respectively in presence of binding agent such as herein described, heating the<br>
said paste initially upto 200° c and then up to 800°C for a period in the range of 10-12 hr to get LiAlo.s Coo.5 O2.<br>
The temperature of preparation of the material is in between 200°C to 800°C for 12 hours.<br>
In the embodiment of this invention mixture of glycerol and urea may be used a s a binding agents for hydroxide and oxides.<br>
Hydroxide of lithium &amp; oxides of Al &amp; Co were powdered to fine size by grinding in them the above mixture in a pestle &amp; mortar arrangement. In this mixture a small quantity of glycerol was added &amp; was ground well to ensure a fine paste. The paste was transferred into a ceramic or porecelain crucible &amp; then heated slowly in a muffle furnace initially for to 200°C temperature and finally to 800°C for 12 hrs. The reactant is cooled to room temperature and has grounded well &amp; examined by x-ray for confirming the identify of the product &amp; purity.<br>
A novel method of preparing this compound viz, LiAlo.5Coo.5O4 was carried out by uniform mixing of oxides of Al and Co with LiOH and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was calcined at 750°C continuously for 12 hrs in a furnace. The prepared product was subjected to x-ray analysis. The product was found to be in single phase.<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of cathode material for a secondary battery, by heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of LiOH, Al2O3 and Co3O4 in glycerol. This paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 250°C. This dried<br><br>
mass was then continuously heated to 7500C for 12 hrs. The compound formed was<br>
slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then examined for its particles size, colour and XRD exposure. It was found that the prepared sample was gray in colour and was homogenous. X-ray analysis confirmed the formation of LiAlo.sCoo.sOa according to Fig. 1.<br>
An uniform homogenous mixture of the ground compounds viz., oxides of aluminium and cobalt with LiOH were made into a paste to get a product of high purity. Glycerol was used as a solvent for binding the oxides viz., aluminium and cobalt with LiOH for making a paste of required consistency. The addition of glycerol enhanced the product of fine particles.<br>
The addition of flux (urea) / excess addition of glycerol (solvent) as a binding material for oxides does not change the colour or quality of the end product.<br>
