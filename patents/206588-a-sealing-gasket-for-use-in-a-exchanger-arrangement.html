				<td>EAT EXCHANGER PLATES AND SEALING GASKETS THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to flat plate heat exchangers generally, and in particular to sealing gaskets therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known in the art to construct flat plate heat exchangers, in which there is provided a plurality of plates arranged adjacent to each other and forming between them sealed passages for two mutually heat exchanging fluids. Flow passages are provided between the plates by virtue of transverse fluid ports formed therein, and by a rubber gasket located between each pair of facing plate surfaces. The gasket is pcnerally of elongate, continuous form, and is arranged for seating in a preformed groove provided along the edge of each plate. The stack is assembled manually, by sliding each plate onto one or more elongate supports, so that the groove extends generally upwards, thereafter, a gasket is placed in the groove. Subsequently, an entire stack of plates and gaskets has been assembled on the supports, it is tightened together, thereby compression the gaskets between the plates so as to seal the spaces between the plates against leakage.<br>
It is of particular importance to ensure that the gaskets are correctly positioned prior to the stack being tightened. Otherwise, the stack may not be properly sealed, leading to leakage. In the event that this happens, it is, of course, necessary to locate the improperly positioned gasket, and to partially dismantle the stack so as to align the gasket properly prior to tightening the stack once more.<br>
Various efforts have been made to facilitate easier and more accurate placement and retention of gaskets prior to tightening.<br>
US Patent. No. 4,377,204,, entitled "Plate Heat Exchanger." describes a plate heat exchanger arrangement in which the plate is formed with a plurality of holes between the gasket seating groove, and the plate edge, and wherein each gasket are provided with a plurality of tabs extending laterally outward from the main gasket portion, and wherein each tab has formed thereon a protrusion which is arranged for insertion into an adjacent hole. The protrusion is provided facing generally downwards, out of the view of a person assembling the gasket and the plate, so as to extend towards the surface of the plate in which the groove is formed, and must be pushed through the hole - away from the in order for the gasket to become property<br>
1<br><br>
fastened to the plate. Moreover, if the protrusions are not pushed through properly. then the gasket will not lay properly, and the extra thickness of a non-inserted protrusion may cause a slight misalignment of the gasket relative to the stack, causing an imperfect seal, and the problems caused thereby.<br>
In an attempt to overcome this problem. US Patent No. 4,635,715, entitled "Gasket Arrangement for a Plate Heat Exchanger," teaches a gasket (or placement into the gasket seating groove of a plate, and which has, on the side of the gasket closest to the plate edge, a plurality of spaced apart plate retention portions, which are arranged at a distance from each other.<br>
This prior art gasket is illustrated in Figs. 25, 26, 27 and 28, herewith, and is denoted generally by the letter a. The main portion of gasket a, formed for seating in a groove b of a heat exchanger plate c, is indicated by the letter d. It will be appreciated that only small sections of both the gasket a and of the plate c are illustrated, and that, in the present drawings, and, indeed, through the present specification, they are intended to represent the entire gasket and plate, respectively.<br>
Fig. 25 shows a section of the gasket a, and Fig. 26 shows proper placement thereof in groove b of heat exchanger plate c. Gasket a has a plurality of plate mounting portions e, of which a single one only, by way of illustrative example, is shown herein. Mounting portion e has one or more projections f, which are formed integrally with and perpendicular to the mam gasket portion d, and thus also to the edge g of plate c. The projections f have integrally iformed therewith a bridge portion /; which is parallel to the main gasket portion d, and from which extend - at right angles thereto - one or more holding elements i. In the present example, a single holding element i is provided.<br>
The holding elements i are parallel to and spaced longitudinally from the projections f, and extend back towards the main gasket portion d. and therebetween, so that the projections f and holding elements i serve to effectively surround the plate edge g, such that the plate mounting portions serve to provide a retention force across the plate, and in the plane of the plate, thereby to reduce the chance of the gasket becoming detached from the plate.<br>
A disadvantage, however, of the solution suggested in the above cited patent, is that it does not securely fasten a gasket to a plate, and, due to the relative flexibility of the gasket, does not piovide sufficient purchase on the plate so as to prevent its distodgment therefrom during assembly.<br>
2<br><br>
Furthermore, and referring now to Fig. 27, it may happen during assembly, that the holding portion f thereof, instead of being fastened underneath the plate edge, instead remains on the top surface thereof. As now seen Fig. 28, the assembling of a subsequent plate onto the improperly placed holding portion f, causes a misalignment in the assembled stack,  thereby causing leakage therefrom. In practice, the misalignment is not normally discovered until use of the stack, which is a source of great inconvenience, as the system has to be properly emptied and disassembled, and, furthermore, as it is difficult to determine the location of the improperly placed holding portion, and it is required to disassemble much or all of the stack in order to determine its location.<br>
3<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to provide, in combination, sealing gaskets for use with a plurality of flat plate heat exchange plates for arrangement in a stack, thereby providing a flat heat exchange stack assembly which is more easily assembtable, is less prone to leakage, and m which gaskets not properly positioned are more easily noticeable prior to use.<br>
In the description that follows, vanous embodiments incorporating the-principles of the invention are described. AN of the embodiments have basic components in common, however," including a heat exchanger plate and portions thereof, and a gasket and portions thereof. For purposes of brevity and ease of understanding, these portions are generally described the first time that they are introduced only, and typically are not specifically described again, except as may be required for understanding of a particular embodiment. These portions are. however, normally denoted in the descnption with a one or two digit prefix, indicative of the drawing  in which they are illustrated or, if a single embodiment is described  in<br>
11<br><br>
conjunction with more than one drawing, the prefix indicates the first drawing in which they are illustrated.<br>
Referring now initially to Fig. 1, there is seen an edge portion 110 of a flat heat exchanger plate 112, whose topography is such that it can accommodate either of the gaskets shown and described below in conjunction with Figs. 2A and 2B. in particular. and referring now also to Figs. 2A and 2B, the heat exchanger plate 112 has an elongate, continuous groove 114, formed in a first side 115 thereof, parallel to the edge 116 of the plate, for seating the main portion 218 of a gasket 220 (Figs. 2A and 2B). The plate also has formed therein a gasket mounting portion, referenced generally 122, which, in the present embodiment, is provided by a pair of channels 124 which extend at right angles from groove 114 to plate edge 116. Between (he channels 124 and extending parallel thereto is a generally elongate, intervening ndge portion 126. which defines a on a second, underside 125 of the plate, a corresponding hollow or recessed portion 128. Ridge portion 126 also has an opening 127 formed therein.<br>
Referring now particularly to Figs. 2A and 2B. gasket 220 has a plate gripping portion, referenced generally 230. which provides for improved attachment of the gasket to the plate. Plate gripping portion 230 has a pair of elongate connector portions 232, which are formed integrally with and project perpendicularly from main gasket portion 218, and are thus oriented perpendicular to plate edge 116. when the main gasket portion 218 is seated in groove 114<br>
Connector portions 232 are joined to each other by an integral bridge portion 234 which is parallel to the main gasket portion 218. and from which extends - at right angles thereto - a holding tab 236. A connector stud 238, or the equivalent thereof, is formed onto holding tab 236. Holding tab 236 is configured for sliding into hoilow 128, beneath ridge portion 126 of gasket mounting portion 122, such that, when main gasket portion 118 is properly seated in groove 114, and plate gripping portion 230 is fully engaged with gasket mounting portion 122, stud 238 is brought into registration with opening 127.<br>
As seen in the drawings, stud 238 may take any suitable form, and may be, by way of example, a simple, generally cylindrical protrusion, as seen in Fig. 2A. Alternatively, however, it may have a conical widened end portion, as seen at 240 in Fig. 2B. As the entire gasket is made of a rubber-like material, the end portion 240 can be easily passed through opening 127, so as to lock the gasket in place.<br>

Attachment of the gasket to lhe plate is thus completed by pressing on the back or underside of holding tab 236. as indicated by arrow 242, thereby to push stud 238 through opening 127 from behind, so as to be clearly visible when protruding therethrough, it will thus be appreciated that, in accordance with the present emoodiment, due to the fact.that the stud is pushed through from behind, in dear view of a person attaching the gasket to the plate, it is much easier to ensure that the gasket is mounted correctly.<br>
Referring now briefly to Fig. 3, it is seen that gasket mounting portion 322 may alternatively be formed such that, rather than a simple hole, plate opening 327 ts formed so as to have a widened, generally funnel shaped opening 342 to edge 316, so as to enable stud 238 to be inserted simultaneously with the mating of connector portions 232 and holding tab 236 with edge portion 310 of plate 312.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4-7B. gasket 420 has a plurality of plate gripping portions 430. each of which has a pair of elongate connector portions 432 which are formed integrally with and extend away from main gasket portion 418. and across plate edge 416 (Figs. 5-7B). Elongate connector portions 432 are also seen to be spaced longitudinally apart along the gasket main portion 418. A single gripping tab 436 is disposed between connector portions 432, and are supported thereat by means of an integrally formed hinge 440. defining a hinge axis 441 parallel to plate edge 416.<br>
In the present embodiment, lhe entire gasket 420 and all the various portions of the gripping portions 430 are preferably formed of a single piece of molded, rubber-like material. Accordingly, gripping tab 436 is formed so as to have an initial, at rest onentation which, in order to bring it into engagement with the plate, requires a relative rotation about hinge 440, thereby generating an elastic, rotational force, in the direction opposite to that of the rotation of the gripping tab 436. In an alternative embodiment, hinge 440 may be a separately formed rod like element, but also having additional resilient means (not shown) so as to provide a desired gripping force.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 5A-6, it is seen that main gasket portion 418 is formed so as to be seated in groove 414 of plate 412, and that after initial placement of the gasket on the plate, the gripping tab 436 has an initial, at rest orientation which is angled generally away from the plate, and from gasket main portion 418. The initial disposition of tab 436 is preferably in the range 90" - 180u relative to the respective planes of plate 412 and connector portions 432, as seen in Figs. 5A and 5B, thereby<br>
13<br><br>
to ensure that when assembling a plate stack, gripping tab 436 of a non-property fastened gasket is easily visible.<br>
As indicated by arrow 442 (Figs. 4 and 6), a rotational force is applied lo gripping tab -436 so as to bring it from its at rest position, shown in Fig. 4 in solid lines, to a position of full gripping engagement with the underside or second side 425 of plate 412. shown in solid lines in Figs. 5A, 5B and 6. The force required to rotate gripping tab 436 about a hinge axis 441, results in a gripping force transverse to the plate 412, as indicated by arrow 444 in Fig. 4, thereby causing an equal and opposite force to be applied to plate 412 by connector portions 432. It will be appreciated that the gripping force is thus a function of the rotational resistance provided by hinge 440, which, in turn is a function of the material properties, the cross-sectional area of the hinge, and the angle through which the gripping tab 436 must be rotated.<br>
As is clear from Fig. 6, in the present embodiment of the invention, tab 435 must be inserted in the space between hinge 440 and the plate edge 416. in order to enable ultimate insertion into hollow 428. The proper positioning of gasket 420. including full mating and gripping engagement of plate gripping portion 430 with plate 412, is seen in Fig. 7A. Fig. 78, on the other hand, clearly shows an improper or incomplete mounting of the gasket 420, indicated by gripping tab 436 standing out in flag like fashion<br>
Referring now briefly to Figs. 8A, 8B and 8C, there is shown an embodiment of the invention which is generally similar to that shown and described above in conjunction with Figs. 4-7B, but wherein the gasket 820 has a single elongate connector portion 832 to which a pair ot gripping tabs 836 are fastened, parallel thereto, via a pair of hinge elements 840. defining a hinge axis 841. in order to accommodate the illustrated gasket 820, plate 812 is provided with a single channel 824, which is bounded by a pair of ridge portions 826, defining therebeneath hollows 828. Mounting of the gasket 820 is generally as described above in relation to gasket 420, and is thus not described again herein.<br>
Figs. 9A and 9B show both a gasket 920 and a plate 912 which, while being generally similar to those described above in conjunction with Figs. 4-7B, is also provided with an additional locking facility, by means of an opening 927 formed in ndge portion 926 of plate edge portion 910, and a locking protrusion 938 arranged for mating engagement with opening 927, once the remainder of plate gripping portion 930 had been brought into complete mating engagement with plate edge portion 910<br>
14<br><br>
Referring now to Figs. 10A - 10C. there is seen a gasket and plate combination in which the plate edge portion 1010 is substantially similar to that shown and described above in conjunction with Figs. 8B and 8C. but wherein there is provided a single connector portion 1032, which is arranged at right angles to the gasket main portion 1018, and which also constitutes a hinge 1040, such that a hinge axis 1041 is also generally perpendicular to both the gasket main portion 1018, but also to the plate edge 1016.<br>
Holding tabs 1036 are formed parallel to axis 1041, so as to be insertable beneath ridge portions 1026, as seen in Figs. 10B and 10C, and are connected to connector portion 1032 via an intermediate joining element 1033, extending at right angles between connector portion 1032 and gripping tabs 1036.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 11-12C. there is seen yet a further gasket and plate combination, but wherein the gripping force is not necessarily provided by means of an integral hinge. In the present embodiment, the hinge apparatus 1140 may either be an integral, natural hinge, or a separate hinge element with little or no rotational resistance, there also being provided a raised bridging portion 1148. Bridging portion 1148, as seen most dearly in Fig. 12B. defines an edge 1150 which, as seen, is located above the second side 1125 of plate edge portion 1110, by an amount e, thereby requiring gripping tab 1136 to be bent therearound, prior to insertion into hollow 1128. This causes a moment of resistance M to be applied by bridging portion 1148 to tab 1136, resulting in a transverse gripping force F being applied by tab 1136 to the underside or second side 1125 of plate edge portion 1110.<br>
It will be appreciated that the magnitude of the gnpping force is determined by the flexibility of the tab 1136, the magnitude of the height difference e. and the optional provision of flexure characteristics to hinge 1140.<br>
The gripping tab 1136 of the present embodiment is seen to have a generally stepped configuration, having a rear portion 1152 connected to hinge 1140, a front, free end portion 1154. for engaging the plate second surface 1125, and a diagonal, intermediate portion 1156. connecting between rear portion 1152 and front portion 1154. It will be appreciated, however, that this is by way of example only, and that a gripping tab having a non-stepped configuration may also be used.<br>
Referring briefly now to Fig. 13, there is shown, in combination, a plate 1312 and a gasket 1320, which are similar to plate 1112 and gasket 1120 of Figs 11-12C. but wherein ridge portion 1326 is provided with an opening 1327 for receiving in mating engagement a locking protrusion 1338 attached to gripping tab 1336<br>
15<br><br>
A feature common to the plate gripping portions of all the gaskets shown and described above in conjunction with Figs. 2A-13. is that the flexible tabs thereof have all been spaced longitudinally from the elongate connector portions extending from the gasket main portion.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention shown and described berembelow in conjunction with Figs. 14A-21B, however, a feature common to all of them is that the gripping tabs thereof at least partially overlap the one or more elongate connector portions to which they are connected.<br>
Refernng now initially to Figs. 14A and 14B, there is seen a portion of a gasket 1420, which is configured for use in combination with a flat plate 1512 (Fig. 15); the combination being illustrated in a fully, properly mounted orientation in Fig. 16. Plate gripping portions 1430 of gaskel 1420 each have a single elongate connector portion 1432 which extends transversely outwards from main portion 1418. and terminates, in the present embodiment, in a forked mounting portion, referenced generally 1460. so as to allow full registration of the single gnpping tab 1436 therebeneath, so as to firmly grasp the plate edge portion therebetween<br>
Mounting portion 1460 splits into a pair ot mounting elements 1462. between which is supported a single gripping tab 1436, via hinge elements 1440, in much the same manner as exemplified by the arrangement seen in Fig. 4. Accordingly, in order to property fasten gasket 1420 to plate 1512, it is necessary to rotate tab 1436 in a generally upward direction (as per the illustrated orientation) about hinge axis 1441, as shown by arrow 1464 (Fig. 14B), and to insert it between the axis 1441 and main stem 1466 of connector portion 1432. as shown in Fig. 16 by arrow 1468.<br>
In the present embodiment, the connector portion 1432 and gripping tab 1436 overlap, and so both the plate edge topography and the plate gripping portion 1430 are formed so as to accommodate the gripping tab 1436 in generally the same plane as gasket main portion 1418. In order to do this, connector portion has a generally stepped configuration, having a rear portion 1470 connected to main portion 1418, and a diagonal, intermediate portion 1472 from which main stem 1466 extends.<br>
Similarly, channel 1524 communicating with groove 1514 extends only part of the way to plate edge 1516. being interrupted by ridge portion 1526. supporting main stem 1466. It will thus be appreciated that, when the plate and gasket combination is fully assembled, the gripping tab 1436 and main stem 1466 of each plate gnpping portion 1430, serve to apply a vice-like gripping force about the plate edge 1512. perpendicular thereto.<br>
16<br><br>
Figs. 17 and 18 illustrate gaskets having plate gripping portions that are generally similar in function to those described above in conjunction with Figs. 14A-16..<br>
In Fig. 17. the illustrated plate gripping portion 1730 has a pair of elongate connector portions 1732, which terminate in a mounting portion 1760 which mounts a pair of gripping tabs 1736, in a manner similar to that in which tabs 836 are mounted to connector portion 832, as shown and described hereinabove in conjunction with Figs. 8A-8C.<br>
In Fig. 18, however, the illustrated plate gripping portion 1830 has a pair of elongate connector portions 1832. which terminate in an integrally formed pair of forked mounting portions 1860, each of which mounts a single gripping tab 1836, in a manner similar to that in which tabs 1436 are mounted to forked mounting portion 1460, as shown and described hereinabove in conjunction with Figs. 14A. 14B and 16.<br>
Fig. 19 illustrates a gasket 1920 having a plate gripping portion 1930 in which a pair of spaced apart elongate connector portions 1932 terminate in a single forked mounting portion 1960, in which a single gripping tab 1936. whose overall width W1 is approximately equal to the corresponding exterior dimension W2 of the pair of connector portions 1932. Accordingly, when plate gripping portion 1920 is in full gripping engagement with the plate edge (not shown), gripping tab 1936 is configured so as to completely overlap the pair of connector portions 1932, thereby providing a relatively increased gripping interface between plate and the gripping portion 1930.<br>
Fig. 20 illustrates a gasket 2020 having a plate gripping portion 2030 which is generally similar to that of Fig. 19. except that a pair of gnpping tabs 2036 is mounted in forked mounting portion 2060. via a relatively elongated hinge element 2040. as shown.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 21A and 21B, there is seen a gasket 2120 having a mounting portion 2130 which is generally similar to that shown and described in conjunction with Fig. 19, except for the addition of an indexing member 2174. Indexing member 2174 is located between elongate connector portions 2132, and is attached at a rear end 2175 to mounting portion 2160, and has a front free end 2176.<br>
When mounting portion 2130 is fully engaged with plate edge portion 2110. the indexing member 2174 extends over the ndge portion 2127.<br>
As seen in Fig. 21B, when an additional plate 2112' is assembled in an adjacent position in the stack, its edge portion 2110' is inserted between indexing<br>
17<br><br>
member 2174 and ridge portion 2127 of the lower plate edge portion 2170, thereby further securing the gasket 2120. As seen, however, in the present embodiment, in order to utilize the indexing tab .2174. the additional plate 2112' is inverted so that ridge portion 2127' thereof rests on ridge portion 2127 of the lower plate edge portion 2110.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 22A-23. there is seen, in combination, a heat exchange plate 2212 and a gasket 2220 having plate gripping portions 2230. Each ptate gripping portion 2230 has a pair of elongate connector portions 2232 extending at right angles from mam gasket portion 2218. Connector portions 2232 are connected by a cross member 2280. so as to have a generally H-like shape, and thus leaving an opening 2281. A gripping tab 2236 is mounted to connector portions 2232 via a resilient hinge element 2240. and is adapted for insertion into gnpping contact with second side 222G of plate edge portion 2210. as indicated by arrow 2282 in Fig. 23. Gripping tab 2236 has a locking protrusion 2284. whose function is described below. It is also seen that cross member 2280 defines a generally flat, plate contact surface 2286, and gnpping tab 2236 also defines a pfate contact surface 2288. which are brought into registration with each other upon full engagement of the plate gripping portions 2230 with plate edge portions 2210. as seen in Fig. 23, thereby providing a vice-like contact therebetween.<br>
Referring now also to Fig. 24. the topography of plate edge portion 2210 is formed so as to accommodate the locking protrusion 2284, by providing a ridge portion 2226. The ridge portion 2226 has a generally rectangular, truncated pyramid shape, so as to define a hollow 2228 therebeneath, in the second side 2225 of the plate 2212, thereby to enable mating engagement thereof with the locking protrusion 2284. Furthermore, the ridge portion 2226 and the opening 2281 are formed so as to also accommodate each other in a mating arrangement, thereby providing maximum purchase between.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the scope of the present invention is not limited by what has been shown and described hereinabove. Rather the scope of the present invention is limited solely by the claims, which follow.<br>
