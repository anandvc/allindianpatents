WATER BORNE COATING COMPOSITION CONTAINING THIOL<br>
FUNCTIONAL COMPOUNDS<br>
The invention relates to a water borne coating composition comprising a<br>
polyol and a polyisocyanate crosslinker, to the use of the coating composition,<br>
and to a kit of parts for preparation of the coating composition.<br>
A coating composition of the above-mentioned type is known from<br>
international patent publication WO 01/81441. This publication describes a<br>
composition comprising as the polyol a branched polyester polyol which is<br>
characterized by specific carboxylic acids and alcohols as raw materials. The<br>
composition of WO 01/81441 can be used as clear coat or as pigmented<br>
coating.<br>
Although it has been found that an acceptable curing rate and pot life can be<br>
obtained with the composition of WO 01/81441, there is a need to provide<br>
such coating compositions having an improved balance of curing rate, pot life,<br>
and film appearance of coatings.<br>
The curing rate of such compositions can be increased to a desirable level by<br>
the addition of curing catalysts, which accelerate the isocyanate hydroxyl<br>
polyaddition reaction. Suitable curing catalysts are known from international<br>
patent publication WO 00/39181 and include organo-metal catalysts and<br>
tertiary amines. Well-known examples of curing catalysts are organo-tin<br>
compounds, such as dimethyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dioctyl tin<br>
dilaurate, and tin octoate.<br>
However, the increase in curing rate as a result of the application of curing<br>
catalysts is attended with a corresponding, undesirable decrease of the pot<br>
life of the multi-pack compositions. Furthermore, the curing catalysts catalyze<br>
both the reaction of isocyanate groups with hydroxyl groups of the film-forming<br>
binder and the reaction of isocyanate groups with water. The latter reaction<br>
generates carbon dioxide gas, which leads to imperfections in the coating film<br>
and which detracts from the film appearance.<br>
International patent publication WO 00/49100 discloses a water borne film-<br>
forming composition comprising a hydroxyl-functional acrylate copolymer and<br>
a   crosslinking   material.   The   crosslinking   material   is   selected   from<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
2<br>
aminoplasts, triazines, and polyisocyanates. The preferred crosslinking<br>
material is a mixture of partially alkylated melamine formaldehyde<br>
condensates and a carbamoyl triazine. In the case of an isocyanate cross-<br>
linking agent, a blocked isocyanate is preferred. Furthermore, the composition<br>
of this publication may comprise an amphiphilic adjuvant. Said adjuvant has<br>
one or more hydrophilic terminal groups at its polar end. The hydrophilic<br>
groups are selected from hydroxyl groups, carbamate groups, amide groups,<br>
urea groups, and mercaptan groups, hydroxyl groups being preferred.<br>
The use of a blocked isocyanate as taught by this publication may lead to a<br>
long pot life and may minimize the film imperfections caused by carbon<br>
dioxide formation as described above. However, WO 00/49100 is silent about<br>
the balance of curing rate, pot life, and good appearance of the coating layer.<br>
International patent publication WO 01/92362 relates to a photoactivatable<br>
coating composition comprising a photolatent base, at least one<br>
polyisocyanate, and at least one compound containing isocyanate reactive<br>
groups, wherein the isocyanate reactive groups comprise at least one thiol<br>
group. The photoactivatable coating composition may be water borne.<br>
It is the object of the current invention to provide a water borne coating<br>
composition comprising a polyol and a polyisocyanate crosslinker which offers<br>
a good balance of curing rate, also in the absence of ultraviolet radiation, at 5<br>
- 80Â°C, pot life, and film appearance of the coating.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved with an aqueous coating composition<br>
according to the opening paragraph, wherein the coating composition<br>
comprises a thiol-functional compound and wherein the molar ratio of<br>
isocyanate groups to thiol groups ranges between 1:0.0001 and 1:0.4.<br>
It should be noted that United States patent US 4788083 describes thiol<br>
blocked tin or bismuth catalysts for isocyanate hydroxyl addition reactions in<br>
solvent borne compositions. However, the possibility to use the disclosed<br>
catalysts in water borne coatings is neither mentioned nor suggested in this<br>
publication.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>

The coating composition according to the invention displays a balance of high<br>
curing rate, long pot life, and good film appearance of the coating prepared<br>
from it which is superior to that of the prior art compositions known from WO<br>
01/81441.<br>

with coating compositions A and 1-4.<br>
Figure  3  is a  graphic  representation  of the carbon  dioxide  formation<br>
experiment with coating compositions A and 1-4.<br>
Suitable polyols to be used in the water borne coating composition include<br>
polyester polyols, polyacrylate polyols, polyurethane polyols, and mixtures<br>
and hybrids thereof.<br>
Polyester polvols<br>
The polyester polyols can be prepared according to generally known methods<br>
by the polyesterification of polycarboxylic acids, their anhydrides or dialkyl<br>
esters with polyalcohols. Optionally, mono-functional acids, monoalcohols<br>
and/or hydroxy-functional acids and/or epoxy compounds may be used as co-<br>
reactants. The reaction to form the polyester polyols can be conducted in one<br>
or more stages.<br>
The polyester polyols suitably have a number average molecular weight in the<br>
range of 300 to 15,000, or 500 to 8,000, or 1,000 to 4,000. In order to achieve<br>
hydroxyl functionality in the resulting polyester polyols, a stoichiometric<br>
excess of the hydroxyl component can be used. The polyester polyols suitably<br>
have a hydroxyl number in the range of 15 to 500 mg KOH/g, or 25 to 300 mg<br>
KOH/g, or 50 to 250 mg KOH/g, or 100 to 220 mg KOH/g. The polyester<br>
polyols generally have a hydroxyl functionality of &gt; 2, for example a hydroxyl<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
4<br>
functionality of &gt; 2.3, or a hydroxyl functionality of &gt; 2.5. In order to achieve<br>
hydroxyl functionalities &gt; 2, the polyester polyols suitably have a branched<br>
structure.<br>
In order to obtain a branched polyester polyol, the condensation reaction is<br>
carried out in the presence of a branching agent, which may be a tri- or<br>
higher-functional acid and/or alcohol. The tri- or higher-functional acid may<br>
suitably be selected from the group of trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid or<br>
the anhydride thereof. The tri- or higher-functional polyalcohol may suitably be<br>
selected from the group of 1,1,1 -trimethylol propane, 1,1,1-trimethylol ethane,<br>
1,2,3-trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and mixtures thereof. In a particular<br>
embodiment a tri- or higher-functional polyalcohol is used, such as 1,1,1-<br>
trimethylol propane.<br>
Further examples of polycarboxylic acids or reactive derivatives thereof that<br>
can be used for the preparation of suitable polyester polyols are phthalic<br>
anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid dimethylester, dimethyl terephthalate,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, adipic<br>
acid, dimeric acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, lithium, sodium, potassium or<br>
amine salts of 5-sulphoisophthalic acid, and dimethyl sulphoisophthalic acid,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of monocarboxylic acids that can be used for the preparation of<br>
suitable polyester polyols are benzoic acid, tert. butyl benzoic acid,<br>
sulphobenzoic acid, lithium, sodium, potassium or amine salts of<br>
sulphobenzoic acid, and saturated acids, for example, linear acids with 5-18<br>
carbon atoms; isononanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, decanoic acid,<br>
dodecanoic acid, pivalic acid, unsaturated acids such as soybean fatty acids,<br>
dehydrated castor oil fatty acids, tali oil fatty acids, etc., and mixtures of these<br>
monocarboxylic acids.<br>
Carboxylic acids with more than 6 carbon atoms are generally suitable.<br>
Examples of hydroxy-functional acids that can be used for the preparation of<br>
suitable polyester polyols are dimethylol propionic acid, hydroxypivalic acid,<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
5<br>
castor oil fatty acids, 12-hydroxystearic acid, 5-hydroxy-pentanoic acid or its<br>
lactone.<br>
Further examples of polyalcohols that can be used for the preparation of<br>
suitable polyester polyols are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl<br>
glycol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, cyclohexane<br>
dimethanol, glycerol, di-trimethylol propane, di-pentaerythritol, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Examples of monoalcohols that can be used for the preparation of<br>
suitable polyester polyols are rt-hexanol, cyclohexanol, tert. butyl cyclo-<br>
hexanol, benzyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, dodecanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alcohols with at least 4 carbon atoms are generally suitable-.<br>
Examples of epoxy-functional compounds are the glycidyl ester of a-branched<br>
monocarboxylic acids, epoxydized vegetable oils, polyglycidyl ethers of<br>
polyalcohols or polyphenols, and polyglycidyl esters of polycarboxylic acids.<br>
Suitable polyester polyols may comprise ionic and/or non-ionic stabilizing<br>
groups. Alternatively or additionally the polyester polyols can be stabilized in<br>
an aqueous medium by external emulsifiers. Such emulsifiers may be<br>
monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compounds and are well known in the art.<br>
Examples of ionic stabilizing groups are carboxylate groups and sulphonate<br>
groups, non-ionic stabilizing groups can be polyalkylene oxide groups.<br>
The polyester polyols suitably have a carboxylic acid number of 
KOH/g (
0.357 meq COOH groups per g of polyol). In particular, the polyester polyols<br>
have a carboxylic acid number of 5 to 15 mg KOH/g (0.089 to 0.268 meq<br>
COOH groups per g of polyol). Optionally, the polyester polyols may have a<br>
sulphonate number of 
polyol). The polyester polyols may for example have a sulphonate number of<br>
0.5 to 4 mg KOH/g (0.009 to 0.070 meq sulphonate groups per g of polyol), or<br>
1 to 3 mg KOH/g (0.0175 to 0.0525 meq sulphonate groups per g of polyol).<br>
Alternatively, the polyester polyols can have a carboxylic acid number of less<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
6<br>
than 10 mg KOH/g (less than 0.178 meq COOH groups per g of polyol), for<br>
example between 5 and 9 mg KOH/g (0.089 to 0.161 meq COOH groups per<br>
g of polyol), and a sulphonate number of at least 0.5 mg KOH/g (at least 0.009<br>
meq sulphonate groups), for example 1 to 3 mg KOH/g (0.0175 to 0.0525 meq<br>
sulphonate groups per g of polyol).<br>
The introduction of the carboxylic acid groups or carboxylate groups into the<br>
polyester polyols can be achieved by incomplete esterification of the<br>
carboxylic groups of the polycarboxylic and/or hydroxy-functional acid<br>
monomers.<br>
Sulphonic acid groups and/or sulphonate groups can be introduced into the<br>
polyester polyols by co-condensation of carboxylic acids and/or alcohols<br>
comprising sulphonic acid groups and/or sulphonate-functional groups, for<br>
example, the lithium, sodium, potassium, and amine salts of 5-sulpho-<br>
isophthalic acid, sulphobenzoic acid, and 2-hydroxyethane sulphonic acid.<br>
Non-ionic stabilizing groups can comprise C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide<br>
groups. Suitable alkylene oxide groups are ethylene oxide groups, but<br>
propylene oxide groups or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide<br>
groups are useful as well. For example, the alkylene oxide groups may be C1-<br>
C4 alkoxy ethers of polyalkylene glycols with the structure:<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon group with 1 to 4, or 1 or 2, carbon atoms; R2 is<br>
a methyl group; x is between 0 and 40, or between 0 and 20, or between 0<br>
and 10; y is between 0 and 50, and x+y is between 2 and 50, or between 2<br>
and 25. Examples are C1-C4 alkoxy polyC2(C3)alkylene oxide glycol and/or C1<br>
C4 alkoxy polyC2(C3)alkylene oxide 1,3-diol, wherein polyC2(C3)alkylene oxide<br>
stands for polyethylene oxide, optionally comprising propylene oxide units.<br>
The polyester polyol suitably comprises 2.5 to 15 wt.% C1-C4 alkoxy<br>
polyalkylene oxide groups with a number average molecular weight of 500 to<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
7<br>
3,000, or between 500 and 1,500, or between 500 and 1,250. A suitable<br>
polyester polyol may comprise 5 to 10 wt.% of C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene<br>
oxide groups. Good results are obtained with polyester polyols wherein the<br>
polyalkylene oxide groups are polyethylene oxide groups.<br>
Suitable compounds comprising C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide groups<br>
contain at least one hydroxyl group. Examples are methoxy<br>
polyC2(C3)alkylene oxide glycols and methoxy polyC2(C3)alkylene oxide-1,3-<br>
diols, such as TegomerÂ® D-3123 (PO/EO = 15/85; Mn = 1,180), TegomerÂ® D-<br>
3409 (PO/EO = 0/100; Mn = 2,240), and TegomerÂ® D-3403 (PO/EO = 0/100;<br>
Mn = 1,180) available from Goldschmidt AG, Germany, and MPEG 750 and<br>
MPEG 1000.<br>
The introduction of the compounds comprising C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene<br>
oxide groups into the polyester polyols can be conducted by co-condensation<br>
in the polyesterification reaction.<br>
If desired, the polyester polyols may contain a proportion of carbonylamino<br>
linking groups -C(=O)-NH- (i.e. amide linking groups) by including an<br>
appropriate amino-functional reactant as part of the "hydroxyl component".<br>
Such amide linkages are in fact useful in that they are more hydrolysis-<br>
resistant and more hydrophilic.<br>
The polyester polyols can be modified, for example, with polyisocyanates to<br>
form urethanes. It is to be understood that the modification is conducted so as<br>
to avoid gelation and to retain hydroxyl functionality. The modification reaction<br>
optionally is carried out in the presence of compounds comprising hydroxy<br>
and/or isocyanate reactive amine groups, for example, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-<br>
hexane diol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol, 1,3-trimethylol propane,<br>
ethylene glycol, 2-ethylhexanol, benzyl alcohol, ethanolamine, N-methyl<br>
ethanolamine, linear or branched polyester polyols, polyether polyols such as<br>
polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, ethoxylated trimethylol propane,<br>
propoxylated    pentaerythritol,    monoalkyl    ethers    of    polyethylene    or<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
10<br>
carboxyethyl acrylate, ethacrylic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, citraconic<br>
acid, and the like. Specific examples of such hydroxy-functional monomers<br>
include 2-hydroxyethyl butyl maleate, bis-(2 hydroxyethyl)maleate, bis-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)fumarate, ethoxylated |}-carboxyethyl acrylate, and propoxylated<br>
b-carboxyethyl acrylate.<br>
The polyacrylate polyols can comprise sulphonic acid groups and/or<br>
carboxylic acid groups. The total content of acid groups is suitably not higher<br>
than 0.9 mmol/gram polyacrylate polyol, for example between 0.09 and 0.6<br>
mmol/gram polyacrylate polyol, or between 0.18 and 0.8 mmol/gram, or<br>
between 0.18 and 0.36 mmol/gram. The acid groups can be completely or<br>
partially neutralized.<br>
The polyacrylate polyols may comprise sulphonic acid groups and carboxylic<br>
acid groups. If both carboxylic and sulphonic acid groups are present, the<br>
molar ratio of carboxylic acid groups/sulphonic acid groups suitably has a<br>
value between 0.1 and 50, or between 0.5 and 10, or between 1 and 5, or<br>
between 1.5 and 3.<br>
Carboxylic or carboxylate groups are conveniently introduced by the<br>
copolymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers having carboxylic<br>
groups. Examples of such carboxylic acid- or carboxylate-functional<br>
monomers are (meth)acrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, (3-carboxyethyl acrylate,<br>
crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid,<br>
monoalkyl esters of unsaturated dibasic acids, such as maleic acid, itaconic<br>
acid, and citraconic acid.<br>
An alternative method for introducing carboxylic groups into acrylic polymers<br>
includes the copolymerization of the reaction products of unsaturated hydroxy-<br>
functional monomers, for example, hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates as listed<br>
above, with a polybasic acid, only a portion of the carboxylic groups being<br>
reacted. Examples of such monomers include the monoesters formed by the<br>
reaction of 1 mole of a hydroxy-functional monomer with 1 mole of a dibasic<br>
acid or its anhydride containing more than 2 carbon atoms. Phthalic acid,<br>
maleic acid, succinic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
9<br>
thus obtained dispersions is in the range of 30 to 300 nm, or in the range of<br>
50 to 200 nm. The thus obtained dispersions have a pH between 6 and 9, or<br>
between 6.5 and 8.<br>
Polvacrvlate polvols<br>
The polyacrylate polyols can be prepared by polymerization of suitable<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers in organic solution or by aqueous<br>
emulsion polymerization. The polymerization can be carried out in one or<br>
more stages. Examples of suitable processes for the preparation of<br>
polyacrylate poiyols are described in WO 00/39181.<br>
The polyacrylate poiyols suitably have a hydroxyl value between 25 and 500<br>
mg KOH/gram polyol, or between 50 and 300 mg KOH/gram polyol, or<br>
between 50 and 200 mg KOH/gram polyol. The hydroxyl value may be<br>
between 75 and 200 mg KOH/gram polyol. The poiyols have two or more<br>
hydroxy groups per molecule, for example three or more.<br>
Examples of suitable ethylenically unsaturated hydroxyl-functional monomers<br>
that can be used for the preparation of polyacrylate poiyols for a coating<br>
composition according to the invention are acrylates and methacrylates, such<br>
as 2-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, or 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxypropyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, and 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate. A further group of suitable<br>
hydroxy-functional monomers is formed by the reaction products of<br>
hydroxylated (meth)acrylates comprising lactone, for example, the reaction<br>
product of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate with e-caprolactone. The (meth)acrylates of<br>
branched 1,3-diols represent a further class of suitable hydroxy-functional<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers, for example, the (meth)acrylates of<br>
2,2(4-trimethyl-1,3-pentane diol, 2,2-dimethyl propane-1,3-diol, 2-ethyl<br>
hexane-1,3-diol, 2-methyl propane-1,3-diol. Further examples of suitable<br>
hydroxy-functional unsaturated monomers are hydroxyalkyl esters of<br>
additional ethylenically unsaturated acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, (3-<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	.	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
8<br>
polypropylene glycols, polyacrylic polyols, epoxy polyols, and polyurethane<br>
polyols.<br>
The polyester polyols can also be modified by the copolymerization of<br>
olefinically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, alkyl acrylates, olefinically<br>
unsaturated monomers containing carboxylic acid, carboxylate, sulphonic<br>
acid, sulphonate-functional groups, and/or alkyl methacrylates, hydroxyalkyl<br>
acrylates, hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, and glycidyl methacrylate to form<br>
polyester - acrylic hybrids.<br>
At the end of the polycondensation reaction in which the polyester polyol is<br>
formed the acid groups of the polyester polyol are at least partially neutralized<br>
with a neutralizing agent, after which water is added, for example to the hot<br>
melt at a temperature starting at 100Â° to 110Â°C, after which the temperature is<br>
gradually lowered to ambient temperature.<br>
Examples of neutralizing agents include alkali metal hydroxides, such as<br>

Suitable primary amines are, for example, isopropyl amine, butyl amine,<br>
ethanol amine, 3-amino-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-<br>
propanol or 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propane diol. Secondary amines that can<br>
be used are, for example, morpholine, diethyl amine, dibutyl amine, N-methyl<br>
ethanol amine, diethanol amine, or diisopropanol amine. Examples of suitable<br>

The aqueous polyester polyol dispersions obtained in this manner can have a<br>
solids content of more than 30 wt.%, such as 35 to 65 wt.%, or 40 to 60 wt.%,<br>
at a viscosity of up to 5 Pa.s, or 0.1 to 3 Pa.s. The average particle size of the<br><br>

methyl hexahydrophthalic acid, irimellitic acid, dodecenyl succinic acid, and<br>
the anhydrides of these acids are examples of polybasic acid reagents. The<br>
reaction between the unsaturated hydroxy-functional monomer and polybasic<br>
acid can take place beforehand to form the described carboxyl-functional<br>
monomer. Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out conveniently during or<br>
even after the formation of the acrylic polymer. Also in the latter case,<br>
polymers having covalently linked carboxylic groups are obtained.<br>
Sulphonic acid or sulphonate groups can be covalently introduced into a<br>
polyacrylate polyol by the copolymerization of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compounds comprising sulphonic acid and/or sulphonate groups. Examples of<br>
suitable monomers are monomers represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrogen, a C1 to C20 monovalent hydrocarbon radical or a<br>
halogen; R2 is a C1 to C20 divalent saturated hydrocarbon, optionally<br>
branched or substituted, and M is a hydrogen, alkali metal, or ammonium.<br>

unsaturated monomers include styrene sulphonic acid, ethylene sulphonic<br>
acid, 2-sulphoethyl methacrylate, and their salts. Alternatively, sulphonate<br>
groups can be introduced into acrylic polyols by reacting alkali metal salts of<br>
taurine or adducts thereof with mono-epoxy compounds, e.g., the glycidyl<br>
ester of a-branched monocarboxylic acids, and epoxy-functional monomers,<br>
e.g., glycidyl methacrylate, prior to, during or after the formation of the acrylic<br>
polyol. Similarly, alkali metal salts of 3-cyclohexylamino-1 -propane sulphonic<br>
acid can be introduced. Further examples of copolymerizable unsaturated<br><br>

sulphonate groups into polyacrylate polyols are the reaction products of free<br>
radical-polymerizable monomers comprising an isocyanate group and<br>

In one embodiment of the coating composition according to the invention,<br>
more than 50% of the sulphonic acid groups and carboxylic acid groups of the<br>
polyacrylate polyol are neutralized with a base, which may be volatile.<br>
Advantageously, the neutralizing agent is ammonia and/or an amine, such as<br>

morpholine, diethyl amine, dibutyl amine, N-methyl ethanol amine, diethanol<br>
amine, and diisopropanol amine. Alternatively, alkali metal hydroxides such as<br>
lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide can be used as<br>
neutralizing agents. Neutralization can be carried out prior to, during or after<br>
polymerization.<br>
In   addition   to   hydroxyl-  and   acid-functional   monomers,   at   least  one<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer that does not comprise hydroxyl- or acid-<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
13<br>
functional groups may be used for the preparation of the polyacrylate polyol.<br>
Suitable examples of such monomers are esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid<br>
having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, or 1 to 12 carbon atoms, in the alcohol part,<br>
such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, t-<br>
butyl (meth)acrylate, hexyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, n-octyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, n-decyl (meth)acrylate, isodecyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, 3,5,5-trimethyl cyclohexyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, t-butyl cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
stearyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylates with ether groups such as 2-methoxy<br>
ethyl (meth)acrylate-, 2-ethoxy ethyl (meth)acrylate, and 3-methoxy-propyl<br>
(meth)acrylate; others such as dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate, glycidyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-<br>
propyl methacrylate. Further suitable monomers are esters of (3-carboxyethyl<br>
acrylate and crotonic acid having 1 to 18 carbon atoms in the alcohol part, and<br>
(cyclo)alkyl esters of unsaturated dicarboxylic acids with 1 to 12 carbon atoms<br>
in the (cyclo)alkyl groups such as diethyl maleate and dibutyl fumarate,<br>
di(cyclo)alkyl itaconates, and di(cyclo)alkyl citraconates.<br>
Other ethylenically unsaturated monomers suitable for the preparation of<br>
polyacrylate polyols include vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene, a-<br>
methyl styrene, o-, m- or p-methyl styrene, and tert-butyl styrene; acrylamide,<br>
methacrylamide, acrylonitrile, N-alkoxy acrylamides, N-alkoxy methacryl-<br>
amides; vinyl esters of C1C18 monocarboxylic acids such as vinyl acetate,<br>
vinyl propionate, vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl esters of a-branched C5-C18<br>
monocarboxylic acids, or vinyl esters of a-branched C9-C11 acids. Other<br>
suitable vinyl monomers include vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, and vinyl silanes such as vinyl trimethoxysilane and vinyl<br>
triethoxysilane.<br>
The polyacrylate polyols in the composition according to the invention may<br>
advantageously comprise hydrophilic alkylene oxide groups. Ethylene oxide<br>
groups are suitable, but alternatively propylene oxide groups or mixtures of<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
14<br>
ethylene oxide and propylene oxide groups are useful as well. For example,<br>
acrylic polyols can comprise copolymerized units of esters of unsaturated<br>
acids and C1-C4 alkoxy ethers of polyalkylene glycols, such as (meth)-<br>
acrylates with the structure:<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrogen or methyl group, R2 is an alkyl group with 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms; R3 is a hydrocarbon radical with 1 to 20, or 1 to 4, or 1 or 2,<br>
carbon atoms; x is between 0 and 40, or between 0 and 20, or between 0 and<br>
10; y is between 0 and 50, and x+y is between 2 and 50, or between 2 and<br>
25. Examples of suitable esters of (meth)acrylic acid and polyalkylene glycol<br>
monoethers are the (meth)acrylates of the methoxy ethers of polyethylene<br>
glycols or polypropylene glycols where the alcohoi has a molecular weight<br>
between 200 and 2,000, or between 200 and 1,500, or between 350 and<br>
1,000.<br>
The polyacrylate polyols of the invention can also contain minor amounts up<br>
to about 10 % of polymerized units of polyunsaturated monomers such as allyl<br>
methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate,<br>
trimethylol propane triacrylate, and the like.<br>
Suitable initiators for the preparation of the polyacrylate polyols are known in<br>
the art, such as di-tert butyl peroxide, tert. butyl peroxy benzoate, tert. butyl<br>
peroxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, tert. butyl peroxy-3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoate, and<br>
the like, and azo initiators such as 2,2'-azo-bis(2-methylbutyronitrile) and 2,2'-<br>
azo-bis (isobutyronitrile).<br>
The molecular weight of the polymers can be controlled by chain regulators<br>
such as n-octyl mercaptan, n-dodecyl mercaptan, tert. dodecyl mercaptan,<br>
mercapto ethanol, mercapto propionic acid, and thioglycol. The polyacrylate<br>
polyols suitably have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) in the range of<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
15<br>
2,500 to 150,000. If improved flow properties of the applied coating are<br>
required, it may be advantageous to use a polyacrylate polyol having a Mw<br>
below 15,000, or below 10,000, or even below 7,000.<br>
Polyurethane polvols<br>
Suitable polyurethane polyols can be prepared according to generally known<br>
methods by reacting an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic di- or triisocyanate, one<br>
or more polyalcohols containing 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups and having a number<br>
average molecular weight up to 600, and/or a polyether or polyester diol<br>
having a number average molecular weight between about 400 and about<br>
3,000. In order to achieve hydroxyl functionality in the resulting polyurethane<br>
polyols, a stoichiometric excess of the hydroxyl component can be used.<br>
Carboxylic acid groups can be introduced into the polyurethanes by the co-<br>
reaction of hydroxy carboxylic acids. Dimethylol propionic acid, hydroxypivalic<br>
acid, and hydroxystearic acid are examples of suitable hydroxy carboxylic<br>
acids.<br>
Sulphonate groups or sulphonic acid groups can be introduced into a<br>
polyurethane polyol, for example, by co-reaction with isocyanates and with<br>
hydroxyl- or amine-functional compounds comprising at least one sulphonic<br>
acid group or sulphonate group, for example, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonic acid,<br>
the sodium salt of 2-aminoethane sulphonic acid, 3-cyclohexylamino-1-<br>
propane sulphonic acid, the reaction product of sodium 5-sulphoisophthalate<br>
with an equivalent excess of diols, triols or epoxy compounds, in which case<br>
the reaction product may contain reacted units of polycarboxylic acids such as<br>
adipic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
trimellitic anhydride, etc.<br>
In one embodiment of the coating composition according to the invention,<br>
more than 50% of the sulphonic acid groups and carboxylic acid groups of the<br>
polyurethane polyol are neutralized with a base. Examples of suitable bases<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>

have been mentioned above in the sections describing the polyester polyols<br>
and the polyacrylate polyols.<br>
The polyurethane polyols may also comprise non-ionic stabilizing groups in<br>
analogy with what has been described for the polyester polyols above.<br>
Alternatively or additionally the poiyurethane polyols can be stabilized in an<br>
aqueous medium by external emulsifiers as mentioned above for polyester<br>
polyols.<br>
A polyol, for example an acrylic polyol, can be grafted to the poiyurethane<br>
polyols. The grafting site in the poiyurethane component can be provided by a<br>
co-reacted unsaturated monomer, for example, an acryloyl-functional hydroxyl<br>
compound such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, an allyl-<br>
functional hydroxyl compound such as trimethylol propane diallyl ether.<br>
The poiyurethane polyols can contain organic solvents for reduction of the<br>
viscosity. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and<br>
xylene; alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, 2-butanol, hexanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol, and ketones such as methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl<br>
ketone, methylamyl ketone, and ethylamyl ketone; esters such as butyl<br>
acetate, butyl propionate, ethoxyethyl propionate, ethylglycol acetate,<br>
butylglycol acetate, and methoxypropyl acetate; ethers such as 2-methoxy-<br>
propanol, 2-methoxybutanol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene<br>
glycol monopropyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, dioxolane or<br>
mixtures thereof. Other suitable solvents are N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl<br>
carbonate, propylene carbonate, butyrolactone, caprolactone, etc.<br>
Mixing the, optionally acrylically modified, poiyurethane polyol with an<br>
aqueous medium can be done conveniently by adding water to the polyol<br>
solution or, alternatively, by adding the poiyurethane polyol solution to water,<br>
under agitation of the water and of the polyol solution. The organic solvent<br>
content of the resulting emulsion or dispersion can be reduced by distillation,<br>
optionally under reduced pressure.<br><br>

methyl) 1-methylcyclohexane, m-a,a,a,a-tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate.<br>
Also suitable as isocyanate curing agents are triisocyanates, for example, 1,8-<br>
diisocyanato-4-(isocyanatomethyl) octane, lysine triisocyanate, and adducts<br>
and oligomers of polyisocyanates, for instance, biurets, isocyanurates,<br>
allophanates, imino-oxadiazinediones, uretdiones, urethanes, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Examples of such oligomers and adducts are the adduct of 3 moles of<br>
toluene diisocyanate to 1 mole of trimethylol propane, the isocyanurate trimer<br>
of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, the isocyanurate trimer of isophorone<br>
diisocyanate, the uretdion dimer of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, the biuret trimer<br>

oligomers of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, the adduct of 3 moles of m-a.a.a.a-<br>
tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate to 1 mole of trimethylol propane, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The polyisocyanate crosslinker may comprise hydrophilic groups, for example,<br>
covalently bonded hydrophilic polyether moieties. Such polyisocyanates can<br>
be stirred in more easily by hand than hydrophobic polyisocyanates.<br>
Suitable polyether compounds for the modification of polyisocyanates are<br>
mono- and dihydric polyalkylene oxide polyether alcohols containing a<br>
statistical average of 3 to 35 ethylene oxide units. The hydrophilic<br>
polyisocyanates generally have an isocyanate functionality of 1.5 to 5 and a<br>
content of ethylene oxide units within the bound polyether chains of about 2 to<br>
20% by weight. Examples of hydrophilic polyisocyanates are the reaction<br>
products of the isocyanurate trimers of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and/or the<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
18<br>
isocyanurate trimers of isophorone diisocyanate and a methyl ether of<br>
polyethylene glycol; the reaction product of the adduct of m-a,a,a,a-<br>
tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (3 moles) to trimethylol propane (1 mole) and<br>
a methyl ether of polyethylene glycol.<br>
Alternatively, the polyisocyanate can be rendered hydrophilic by reaction with<br>
isocyanate reactive compounds containing ionic groups, for example, the<br>
alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids containing at least one hydroxyl group or<br>
one isocyanate reactive amine group.<br>
Another class of suitable polyisocyanate crosslinkers are polyisocyanates<br>
which contain external emulsifiers to facilitate their dissipation in water borne<br>
systems. Such polyisocyanate crosslinkers are commercially available from<br>
Rhodia.<br>
The polyisocyanate and the aqueous polyol resin dispersion are suitably<br>
mixed in such a ratio that the NCO:OH ratio is in the range of 0.5-3:1, or 0.75-<br>
2.5:1, or 1-2:1.<br>
The thiol-functional compound<br>
Esters of mercapto-carboxylic acids are a group of suitable thiol-functional<br>
compounds. They can be prepared by reacting hydroxyl group-containing<br>
compounds with thiol group-containing acids, such as 3-mercapto propionic<br>
acid, 2-mercapto propionic acid, thio-salicylic acid, mercapto succinic acid,<br>
mercapto acetic acid, or cysteine. Examples of suitable hydroxyl group-<br>
containing compounds are mono-alcohols, diols, triols, and tetraols, such as<br>
2-ethylhexanol, iso-octyl alcohol, decyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, iso-tridecyl<br>
alcohol, or higher monoalcohols or mixtures thereof, 1,4-butane diol, 1,6-<br>
hexane diol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propane diol, 2-ethyl-2-propyl-1,3-propane diol,<br>

dimethanol, 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, 1,2,3-trimethylol propane, and<br>
pentaerythritol. Examples of compounds prepared according to such a<br>
method include pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercapto propionate),<br>
pentaerythritol tetrakis (2-mercapto acetate), trimethylol  propane tris (3-<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
19<br>
mercapto propionate), trimethylol propane tris (2-mercapto propionate), and<br>
trimethylol propane tris (2-mercapto acetate). Good results have been<br>
obtained with trimethylol propane tris (3-mercapto propionate) and<br>
pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercapto propionate).<br>
A further example of a compound prepared according to such a method<br>
consists of a hyperbranched polyol core based on a starter polyol, e.g.,<br>
trimethylol propane, and dimethylol propionic acid. This polyol is subsequently<br>
esterified with 3-mercapto propionic acid and isononanoic acid. These<br>
methods are described in European patent publication EP 0448224 A and<br>
International patent publication WO 93/17060.<br>

reaction, an electrophilic reaction or a radical reaction;<br>
the reaction of a (poly)isocyanate with a thiol-functional alcohol, and<br>
the reduction of disulphides.<br>
The thiol-functional compound can also comprise other functional groups, for<br>
example hydroxyl groups. b-Hydroxy-thiols can generally be obtained by<br>
reacting epoxide-functional compounds with hydrogen sulphide. An example<br>
of such a thiol-functional compound may have the following formula:<br>
T[(C3H6O)nCH2CHXHCH2YH]3, with T being derived from a triol such as<br>
trimethylol propane or glycerol, n being an integer between 0 and 10, X and Y<br>
being oxygen or sulphur, with the proviso that X and Y are not equal. An<br>
example of such a compound is commercially available from Cognis under the<br>
trademark CapcureÂ® 3/800.<br><br>

Alternatively, polymeric thiol-functional compounds can be used. In this case<br>
the polymer is a resin having as a backbone a polyester resin, a polyurethane<br>
resin, a polyacrylate resin, or a polyether resin. These polymeric thiol-<br>
functional compounds can also comprise hydroxyl groups.<br>
The thiol-functional compound can be a polyester prepared from (a) at least<br>
one polycarboxylic acid or reactive derivatives thereof, (b) at least one polyol,<br>
and (c) at least one thiol-functional carboxylic acid. The polyesters suitably<br>
possess a branched structure. Branched polyesters are conventionally<br>
obtained through condensation of polycarboxylic acids or reactive derivatives<br>
thereof, such as the corresponding anhydrides or lower alkyl esters, with poly-<br>
alcohols, when at least one of the reactantshas a functionality of at least 3.<br>
Examples of suitable polycarboxylic acids or reactive derivatives thereof are<br>
tetrahydrophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic acid,<br>
hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyl hexahydrophthalic acid, methyl hexa-<br>

propionic acid, 2-mercaptopropionic acid, thio-salicylic acid, mercaptosuccinic<br>
acid, mercaptoacetic acid, cysteine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Optionally, monocarboxylic acids and monoalcohols may be used in the<br>
preparation of the polyesters. C4-C18 monocarboxylic acids and C8-C18<br>
monoalcohols may be used. Examples of the C4-C18 monocarboxylic acids<br>

C6-C18 monoalcohols include cyclohexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, stearyl alcohol,<br>
and 4-tert. butyl cyclohexanol.<br>
The thiol-functional compound may also comprise ionic and/or non-ionic<br>
groups for stabilization of the thiol-functional compound in an aqueous<br>
solution or dispersion. Suitable ionic and non-ionic stabilizing groups are<br>
those which have been described above for polyol resins.<br>
Good results can also be obtained with an aqueous thiol-functional<br>
polyurethane dispersion which is obtainable by first preparing an isocyanate-<br>
functional polyurethane from diols, diisocyanates, and building blocks<br>
containing groups which facilitate the stabilization of the resin in an aqueous<br>
dispersion, followed by reaction of the isocyanate-functional polyurethane with<br>
a polyfunctional thiol in a base-catalyzed addition reaction, followed by<br>
dispersion in water.<br>
The thiol-functional compound may be a thiol-functional polyacrylate. Such a<br>
polyacrylate is derived from hydroxyl-functional acrylic monomers, such as<br>
hydroxy ethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxy propyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxy butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, other acrylic monomers such as (meth)acrylic acid, methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, optionally in combination with a vinyl<br>
derivative such as styrene, and the like, or mixtures thereof, the terms (meth)-<br><br>

well as to methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, respectively. The thiol group is<br>
introduced by esterification of (part of) the hydroxyl groups of the acrylate<br>
copolymer with one or more of the thiol-functional carboxylic acids described<br>
above.<br>
Alternatively, glycidyl methacrylate is introduced into the polymer to prepare<br>
an epoxy-functional polyacrylate. The epoxy groups are then reacted with<br>
suitable thiol-functional carboxylic acids such as mentioned above.<br>
Alternatively, the thiol group can be introduced by reacting an isocyanate-<br>
functional polyacrylate and a thiol-functional alcohol, e.g., mercapto ethanol.<br>
The polyacrylate is prepared by conventional methods, for instance; by the<br>
slow addition of appropriate monomers to a solution of an appropriate<br>
polymerization initiator, such as an azo or peroxy initiator.<br>
Also included in the coating composition of the invention may be thiol-<br>
functional hydrocarbons and thiol-functional alcohols, which can be mono-, di-<br>
, tri-, or higher thiol-functional compounds such as ethane dithiol, bis-beta-<br>
mercapto-ethyl sulphide, thiophenol, 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,4-butane dithiol,<br>
2,3-dimercapto propanol, dodecane dithiol, 1,6-hexane dithiol, 1-octane thiol,<br>
dodecane thiol, cyclohexyl mercaptan, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The thiol-functional compound suitably comprises 1 to 6 thiol groups per<br>
molecule. Thiol-functional compounds having 1 to 4 thiol groups are preferred.<br>
If the coating composition additionally comprises a metal based curing<br>
catalyst as described below, the preferred number of thiol groups per<br>
molecule of thiol-functional compound is 1 or 2. The advantage of using a<br>
mono- or difunctional thiol-functional compound is even more pronounced if a<br>
high amount of curing catalyst is present to achieve a high cure speed of the<br>
coating composition.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
23<br>
Examples of suitable thiol-functional compounds are pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-<br>
mercapto propionate), trimethylol propane tris(3-mercapto propionate),<br>
CapcureÂ® 3/800,1-dodecanethiol, and dodecyl-3-mercapto propionate.<br>
The thiol-functional compound is generally present in an amount of 0.05 to 25<br>
weight-%, or in an amount of 0.5 to 20 weight-%, calculated on the weight of<br>
solid polyol resin.<br>
As mentioned above, the molar ratio of isocyanate groups to thiol groups in<br>
the coating composition according to the invention ranges between 1:0.0001<br>
and 1:0.4. Alternatively, the molar ratio of isocyanate groups to thiol groups<br>
ranges between 1:0.0003 and 1:0.25. A preferred range is between 1:0.0006<br>
and 1:0.20.<br>
The coating composition of the invention is generally employed as a multi-<br>
component composition. This means that the polyol and the polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinker are generally stored in separate containers. The components are<br>
mixed prior to application.<br>
The polyol can be dispersed in water during or after preparation of the polyol<br>
as outlined above. In a particular embodiment of the invention, it is also<br>
possible to store and deliver the polyol in a substantially non-aqueous form<br>
and to disperse the polyol immediately prior to formation of the coating<br>
composition. In yet another embodiment, it is possible to disperse the polyol in<br>
water after it has been mixed with at least one or all of the other components<br>
of the coating composition. Details of these embodiments are generally known<br>
and can for example be inferred from International patent application WO<br>
00/59977.<br>
It is to be understood that polyols with different types of polymeric or<br>
oligomeric backbones as described above can be used as such or as mixtures<br>
or hybrids.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
24<br>
Due to possible hydrolysis of isocyanate groups, the polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinker is generally stored under non-aqueous conditions before formation<br>
of the aqueous coating composition.<br>
The thiol-functional compound can be added to the coating composition as a<br>
separate component, but it can also be pre-mixed with the polyol or other<br>
separate components, e.g. with a diluent or with an optionally present curing<br>
catalyst. If a metal based catalyst is present in the coating composition, it is<br>
possible to pre-mix the thiol-functional compound with the metal based curing<br>
catalyst and to subsequently add the pre-mix to the polyol. The pre-mix of<br>
catalyst and thiol-functional compound can be added to the polyol before or<br>
after formation of an aqueous polyol dispersion. This gives rise to a<br>
particularly favourable exploitation of the effect of the current invention, i.e. an<br>
improved balance of curing rate, appearance, and pot life.<br>
The pre-mix of catalyst and thiol-functional compound may be provided as a<br>
mixture of the compounds as such, as a solution in a suitable organic solvent,<br>
or in an aqueous carrier, i.e. as an aqueous solution or dispersion. If provided<br>
in an aqueous carrier, the thiol-functional compound suitably comprises ionic<br>
or non-ionic stabilizing groups as described above.<br>
Although we do not wish to be bound by any theory, it is believed that an<br>
interaction between the thiol-functional compound and the metal based<br>
catalyst leads to temporary partial deactivation of the catalyst.<br>
It is also possible that the polyol comprises thiol-functional groups. In this case<br>
the thiol-functional compound does not form a separate component.<br>
Optional components<br>
In one embodiment the coating composition of the invention also comprises a<br>
metal based curing catalyst. Suitable metals include zinc, cobalt, manganese,<br>
zirconium, bismuth, and tin. It is preferred that the coating composition<br>
comprises a tin based catalyst. Well-known examples of tin based catalysts<br>
are dimethyl tin dilaurate, dimethyl tin diversatate, dimethyl tin dioleate, dibutyl<br>
tin dilaurate, dioctyl tin dilaurate, and tin octoate.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
25<br>
When the coating composition according to the invention comprises a metal<br>
based catalyst, it is preferred that the molar ratio of catalyst metal atoms to<br>
thiol-functional groups ranges between 1:0.5 and 1:250, or between 1:0.8 and<br>
1:150, or between 1:1 and 1:100.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention can further comprise other<br>
components and additives conventionally present in coating compositions,<br>
such as pigments, extenders, colouring agents, pigment dispersants,<br>
emulsifiers (surfactants), rheology-controlling agents, levelling agents, flatting<br>
agents, coalescents, wetting agents, anti-cratering agents, anti-foaming<br>
agents, biocides, plasticizers, UV absorbers,' light stabilizers, and odour<br>
masking agents.<br>
Also included in the coating composition of the invention may be reactive<br>
diluents such as water-soluble mono- or (preferably) polyhydric alcohols.<br>
Examples of monohydric alcohols include hexyl glycol, butoxyethanol, 1-<br>
methoxy-2-propanol, 1-ethoxy-2-propanoI, 1-propoxy-2-propanol, 1-butoxy-2-<br>
propanol, 2-methoxybutanol, 1-isobutoxy-2-propanol, dipropylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, diacetone alcohol, methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
isopropanol, butanol, 2-butanol, pentanol, hexanol, benzyl alcohol, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Examples of polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isomeric butane diols, the polyethylene<br>
oxide glycols or polypropylene oxide glycols, 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, 1,2,3-<br>
trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, glycerol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to a kit of parts for preparation of a water borne<br>
coating composition comprising<br>
a)	a binder module comprising a polyol,<br>
b)	a crosslinker module comprising a polyisocyanate, and<br>
c)	an additive module comprising a thiol-functional compound.<br>
The crosslinker module b) or the additive module c) or both may additionally<br>
comprise a metal based curing catalyst.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
26<br>
In an alternative embodiment the kit of parts comprises<br>
a)	a   binder  module  comprising  a   polyol  and   a  thiol-functional<br>
compound and<br>
b)	a crosslinker module comprising a polyisocyanate.<br>
In a preferred version of this alternative the binder module additionally<br>
comprises a metal based curing catalyst, or the kit of parts additionally<br>
comprises an additive module c) comprising a metal based curing catalyst.<br>
The kit of parts suitably comprises metering aids to facilitate mixing of the<br>
components in the required ratios. In one embodiment, the modules of the kit<br>
of parts comprise the components in the required ratios; i.e. the modules are<br>
provided in a plurality of containers which contain the components in the<br>
required amounts to form the coating composition of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the amount of the components may be provided in ratios<br>
deviating from the required ratios for the coating composition and additionally<br>
a metering aid is provided, such a mixing container having visible indications<br>
for the required volumes of the modules to form the coating composition of the<br>
invention. The required volumes may also be indicated on a so-called<br>
metering stick which is common in the paint industry. Variations and<br>
combinations of suitable metering aids will be readily appreciated by a skilled<br>
person.<br>
The coating composition of the invention can further comprise one or more<br>
other well-known coating resins, for example, epoxy resins, phenolic resins,<br>
cellulose nitrate, polyvinyl butyral resins, etc. If so desired, the other coating<br>
resins can be functionalized with hydroxyl reactive groups selected from the<br>
group of isocyanate, epoxy, acetal, carboxyl, anhydride, and alkoxy silane<br>
groups. Also, mixtures of these groups in one compound are included. The<br>
coating composition can also comprise an amino resin. Depending on the<br>
presence of additional functional groups, the coating composition can further<br>
comprise other known curing catalysts, for example, tertiary amines or<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
27<br>
sulphonic acids, such as p-toluene sulphonic acid and dodecyl benzene<br>
sulphonic acid.<br>
The major part of the volatile content of the coating composition of the present<br>
invention consists of water. However, the coating composition can contain one<br>
or more organic solvents, with the proviso that the volatile organic content<br>
(VOC) of the ready-for-use coating composition does not exceed 540 g/l,<br>
preferably it does not exceed 420 g/l. As suitable organic solvents may be<br>
mentioned dimethyl dipropylene glycol, methyl ether of diacetone alcohol,<br>
ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl glycol acetate, butyl glycol acetate, 1-<br>
methoxy-2-propyl acetate, butyl propionate, ethoxy ethyl propionate, toluene,<br>
xylene, methylethy! ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone,<br>
ethyl amyl ketone, dioxolane, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl carbonate,<br>
propylene carbonate, butyrolactone, caprolactone, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The coating composition is particularly suitable as clear and/or pigmented top<br>
coat. The composition according to the invention is also suitable for use as<br>
filler, primer, base coat, and adhesive.<br>
The coating composition can be applied to many substrates, such as metal,<br>
wood, paper, cardboard, gypsum, concrete, glass, plastic and other synthetic<br>
materials, including some other coating layer. The other coating layer may be<br>
comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be<br>
comprised of a different coating composition. The coating composition shows<br>
particular utility as a clear coat in a multi-layer lacquer coating, such as a clear<br>
top coat on a colour and/or effect imparting base coat.<br>
The coating composition of the current invention can be used advantageously<br>
in  various  application fields,  such  as the finishing  and   refinishing  of<br>
automobiles and large transportation vehicles such as trucks, buses, railway<br>
equipment,   airplanes   and   ships,   and   further  on   steel   and   concrete<br>
constructions.<br>
Any known methods for applying coating compositions to a substrate can be<br>
used. Non-limiting examples of such application methods are spreading (e.g.,<br><br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
28<br>
brushing, rolling, by paint pad or doctor blade), spraying (e.g., airfed spraying,<br>
airless spraying, hot spraying, spraying with a two-component spray gun, and<br>
electrostatic spraying), flow coating (e.g., dipping, curtain coating, roller<br>
coating and reverse roller coating), and electrodeposition.<br>
Coating layers prepared from the composition of the current invention can be<br>
dried and cured between 0 and 160Â°C, or between 5 and 80Â°C, or between 10<br>
and 60ÂºC. Curing at elevated temperature can be carried out in an oven.<br>
Alternatively, curing may be supported by infrared and/or near radiation.<br>
Before curing at elevated temperature the applied coating composition may<br>
optionally be subjected to a flash-off phase.<br>

General methods<br>
The average particle size given was determined with the aid of dynamic light<br>
scattering, with the dispersion diluted to a solids content of about 0:1 wt %.<br>
The viscosity was determined with a Brookfield viscometer (LV - 4; 60<br>
revolutions per minute). The solids content was calculated from the weight<br>
loss of a sample heated to 140Â°C over a period of 30 minutes. The Mn was<br>
measured with GPC with polystyrene as standard.<br>
Infrared spectra were measured on a Biorad FTS-60 spectrophotometer or on<br>
a Bruker Vector 22 instrument. Infrared spectra were measured making use of<br>
a Golden Gate single reflection ATR device. All infrared spectra were<br>
recorded between 4,000 cm'1 and 600 cm'1 at a resolution of 2 cm-1.<br>
The drying stage of applied coating layers was determined manually, with 10<br>
drying stages being discerned:<br>
1	The still-wet coating is easily rubbed off with the thumb.<br>
2	By touching the coating with the thumb, threads of paint may be drawn.<br>
3	The coating is cohesive, but is easily damaged down to the substrate<br>
by gentle rubbing with the thumb.<br>
4	Gentle rubbing with the thumb leaves a clear mark.<br>
5	Gentle rubbing with the thumb hardly leaves a mark. A tuft of wadding,<br>
dropped on the paint, can be blown off. The coating is dust-dry.<br>
6	Gentle rubbing with the thumb leaves no mark. On gentle rubbing or<br>
pushing with the palm of the hand a sticky effect is felt.<br>
7	On gentle rubbing or pushing with the palm of the hand, no stickiness is<br>
observed. The coating is tack-free.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
30<br>
8	Firm pushing with the thumb leaves a permanent mark.<br>
9	The mark from firm pushing with the thumb disappears after 1-2<br>
minutes. The coating is touch-dry.<br>
10	The coating can hardly, or not at all, be damaged by scratching with<br>
the (human) nail. The coating is hardened-through.<br>
The distinctness of image (DOI) of clear coat films was determined with an<br>
ATI DOI-meter one day after application of the clear coat. Higher DOI values<br>
indicate a better film appearance.<br>

A 6-litre 4-neck flask was fitted with a variable speed stirrer, thermocouples in<br>
combination with a controller, a distillation column, a condenser, a nitrogen in-<br>
and outlet, and a heating mantle. The flask was charged with a mixture<br>
composed of:<br>
385.1 g   of isophthalic acid<br>

After deaeration, the flask was brought under a nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
contents of the flask were heated to 150Â°C, whereupon the temperature was<br>
gradually increased to 200Â°C over a period of 2 hours. Water was distilled off.<br>
The temperature of 200Â°C was maintained in the flask until a clear reaction<br>
melt was obtained. The mixture was cooled to 140Â°C, after which the following<br>
components were added:<br>
385.1 g   isophthalic acid and<br>
1,195.8 g   sebacicacid<br><br>

temperature until an acid value below 7 mg KOH/g was obtained.<br>
The end product had an acid number of 6.4 mg KOH/g, a practical OH-value<br>
of 199 mg KOH/g, an OH-functionality of 4.9, and an Mn = 1771.<br>
Preparation of a polyester dispersion 1 from polyester polyol 1 described<br>

661.17 g  of trimethylol propane<br>
58.75 g   of demineralized water<br>
1.25 g   of Fascat 4100<br>
After deaeration, the flask was brought under a nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
contents of the flask were heated to 150Â°C, whereupon the temperature was<br>
gradually increased to 200Â°C over a period of 1.5 hours. Water was distilled<br>
off. The temperature of 200Â°C was maintained in the flask until a clear<br>

319.08 g   of sebacinic acid<br>
187.19 g   of methoxy polyethylene oxide glycol (Mn = 750)<br>
The temperature of the reaction mixture was gradually increased to 220Â°C,<br>
and it was kept at this temperature until an acid value of about 10 mg KOH/g<br>
was obtained.<br>
The end product had an acid number of 9.1 mg KOH/g, a practical OH-value<br>
of 190 mg KOH/g, an OH-functionality of 4.3, and an Mn = 2295.<br>
Preparation of a polyester dispersion 2 from polyester polyol 2 described<br>
above<br>
A flask fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping<br>

33<br>
hours: 590.6 g of demineralized water, after which the temperature was<br>
gradually decreased from 90Â°C to 30Â°C.<br>
The properties of the thus obtained water borne polyester dispersion were pH<br>
8.4, particle size 78 nm, viscosity 0.12 Pa sec, non-volatile content 42 weight-<br>
%.<br>
Preparation of polyacrylate polyol 1<br>
A reaction vessel equipped with an agitator, a condenser, a thermocouple,<br>
and a nitrogen inlet device was charged with 218 g butylglycol and heated to<br>
140Â°C under a nitrogen flow of 5 I per hour. Then a mixture of 162 g n-butyl<br>
acrylate, 142 g styrene, 152 g methyl methacrylate, 208 g hydroxyethyl<br>
acrylate, 21 g lauryl methacrylate, and 22 g TrigonoxÂ® 42S was added<br>
continuously to the reactor. During the addition the temperature of the reactor<br>
content was maintained at 140Â°C. After a dosing time of 165 minutes, when<br>
about 75 weight-% of the monomer and the initiator had been added, the<br>
addition was stopped. In this first phase, a hydrophobic acrylic polymer<br>
without acid-functional groups was formed.<br>
A preformed mixture of 11 g 2-acrylamido 2-methyl propane sulphonic acid, 5<br>
g 2-(dimethyl amino) ethanol, and 18 g butylglycol was mixed with 13 g of<br>
acrylic acid. This mixture was then added to the remaining portion of the<br>
monomer and initiator mixture. The resulting mixture was homogenized.<br>
Subsequently, the mixture was fed to the reactor over a period of 75 minutes,<br>
the temperature in the reactor being held at 140Â°C. In this second phase acid-<br>
functional polymers are formed.<br>
After completion of the monomer addition, the dosing equipment was rinsed<br>
with 21 g butylglycol, which was subsequently added to the reactor content.<br>
The reactor charge was held at 140Â°C for 15 minutes. A solution of 1 g<br>
TrigonoxÂ® 42 S in 6 g butylglycol was then added in two equal portions with a<br>
time interval of 15 minutes. After the mixture was held at 140Â°C for another 30<br>
minutes, the reactor content was cooled to room temperature.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>

The polyacrylate polyol had a hydroxyl number of 140 mg KOH/g on solids, a<br>
weight average molecular weight of 16,800 and a number average molecular<br>
weight of 5,200. The combined carboxylic acid/carboxylate content was 0.225<br>
mmol/g on solids, the combined sulphonic acid/sulphonate content was 0.075<br>
mmol/g on solids. The solids content of the solution was 72.1 % by weight.<br>
Preparation of polyacrylate polyol dispersion 1<br>
Into a glass reactor equipped with a stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, and a condenser<br>
440 g of polyacrylate polyol solution 1 described above were charged and<br>
heated to 130Â°C under a nitrogen flow of 10 I per hour. Then, under reduced<br>
pressure, about 25 weight-% of b'utylglycol was distilled off in order to obtain a<br>
concentrated resin solution. The content of the reactor was added gradually,<br>
over a period of 20 minutes, to a second reactor containing 548 g<br>
demineralized water and 12 g dimethanol amine pre-heated to 50 - 55Â°C.<br>
During the addition of the concentrated resin solution the temperature in the<br>
second reactor increased to about 60Â°C. A white aqueous emulsion was<br>
obtained, which was stirred at 55 - 60Â°C for a period of 60 minutes. Finally the<br>
emulsion was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The polyacrylate<br>
dispersion had a solids content of 39.4 weight-%, an average particle size of<br>
98 nm, and a viscosity of 100 mPa-s at 23Â°C.<br>
Coating compositions A and 1-4 were prepared from the ingredients as<br>
shown in Table 1; the amount of ingredients is given in parts by weight:<br><br>

The coating compositions according to Table 1 were prepared as follows:<br>
Component A was stirred with an electrical stirrer at 600 rotations per minute,<br>
component B was added, stirring was continued for 2 minutes and component<br>
C was added. The final composition was stirred for another 2 minutes.<br>
Composition A is a comparative composition which represents the state of the<br>
art water borne coating composition comprising a polyol and a polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinker according to WO 01/81441. Compositions 1-4 represent coating<br>
compositions according to the invention.<br>
Curing speed of coating compositions A and 1-4:<br>
The curing of compositions A and 1-4 was followed by observation of the<br>
isocyanate signal at 2,275 cm-1 in their infrared spectra. For measurement of<br>
the infrared spectra a 60 u.m film of the coating composition was applied to the<br>
golden gate crystal 15 minutes after preparation of the composition. The films<br>
were touch-dry within 10 minutes. Spectra were measured at room<br>
temperature every 7 minutes. In figure 1 the height of the isocyanate signal is<br>
plotted versus time. It should be noted that the increase in isocyanate signal<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
36<br>
height in the first phase of curing can be explained by an increase in<br>
isocyanate concentration due to evaporation of solvent and water.<br>
Figure 1 shows that the decrease in isocyanate content during curing of<br>
coating compositions 3 and 4 is faster than in the case of composition A, the<br>
isocyanate decrease of composition 2 is practically equal to that of<br>
composition A, while the isocyanate decrease of composition 1 is slightly<br>
slower than that of composition A.<br>
Since the decrease in isocyanate content indicates the curing rate of water<br>
borne  coating  compositions  comprising  a  polyol  and  a  polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinker, it can be concluded that the curing rate of coating compositions 2<br>
- 4 according to the invention is the same or higher than the curing rate of â¢<br>
comparative coating composition A comprising no thiol-functional compound.<br>
Pot life of coating compositions A and 1-4:<br>
The decrease of the isocyanate content of the compositions A and 1-4 after<br>
mixing, i.e. during their pot life, was determined by observation of the<br>
isocyanate signal at 2,275 cm"1 in their infrared spectra. For measurement of<br>
the infrared spectra a few drops of the composition were placed on the<br>
diamond crystal of the IR spectrometer directly after mixing and immediately<br>
capped with a rubber-ring sealed metal cap. Spectra were measured every 5<br>
minutes until a maximum time of 150 minutes. In figure 2 the height of the<br>
isocyanate signal is plotted versus time. The height of the isocyanate signal of<br>
the first measurement of every composition was set to a relative value of 100<br>
in figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 clearly shows that the decrease of the isocyanate content after<br>
mixing of the coating compositions 1 - 4 is slower than in comparative coating<br>
composition A. Since the decrease in isocyanate content determines the pot<br>
life of water borne coating compositions comprising a polyol and a<br>
polyisocyanate crosslinker, the pot life of coating compositions 1 - 4<br>
according to the invention is longer than the pot life of composition A<br>
comprising no thiol-functional compound.<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>

Carbon dioxide formation of coating compositions A and 1 - 4:<br>
The increase in carbon dioxide content of compositions A and 1-4 after<br>
mixing, i.e. during their pot life, was determined by observation of the carbon<br>
dioxide signal at 2,334 cm"1 in their infrared spectra. The measurement of the<br>
infrared spectra was carried out as described above for determination of the<br>
isocyanate decrease during pot life. In figure 3 the height of the carbon<br>
dioxide signal is plotted versus time.<br>
Figure 3 clearly shows that the amount of carbon dioxide formed in<br>
composition A is higher than in compositions 1-4. Formation of carbon<br>
dioxide is one of the major causes of film defects and poor appearance of<br>
water borne coating compositions" comprising a polyol and a polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinker. Therefore, it can be concluded that coating compositions 1-4<br>
according to the invention have a higher potential for good appearance than<br>
composition A comprising no thiol-functional compound.<br>
Coating compositions B and 5 to 8<br>
Comparative coating composition B and compositions 5 to 8 according to the<br>
invention were prepared from the ingredients as shown in Table 2; the amount<br>
of ingredients is given in parts by weight.<br>
The coating compositions according to Table 2 were prepared as follows:<br>
Component A was stirred with an electrical stirrer at 600 rotations per minute,<br>
component B was added, stirring was continued for 2 minutes and component<br>
C was added. The final composition was stirred for another 2 minutes.<br><br>

Precoated aluminium panels were coated with a layer of AutowaveÂ®, a water<br>
borne base coat which was applied and dried as prescribed in the technical<br>
documentation of the supplier.<br>
In a first series the clear coat compositions of Table 2 were spray applied<br>
directly after preparation on top of the base coat panels. The dry layer<br>
thickness of the clear coats was in the range of 40 to 50 mm. After application<br>
of the clear coats the panels were subjected to a flash-off period of ten<br>
minutes at room temperature. Subsequently the panels were cured for 45<br>
minutes in an oven at 60Â°C. After cooling to room temperature the drying<br>
stage of the clear coats was determined manually. The DOI was determined<br>
after one day.<br>
In a second series the clear coat compositions of Table 2 were applied in a<br>
similar manner as in the first series; however, the clear coat compositions<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>
39<br>
were allowed to stand for 60 minutes before application and oven cured for 30<br>
minutes at 60Â°C. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br><br>

From Table 3 it can be inferred that the clear coat compositions according to<br>
the invention exhibit an improved curing rate over comparative clear coat<br>
composition B. The appearance of the clear coats of the invention is on a<br>
similar level and can in some cases be superior to the appearance of the<br>
comparative clear coat. The improved curing rate is also apparent when the<br>
clear coats are applied one hour after mixing, which indicates that the<br>
advantages are not obtained at the expense of pot life. The compositions of<br>
Table 2 do not comprise a curing catalyst for the isocyanate-hydroxyl addition<br>
reaction, such as dibutyltin dilaurate. The beneficial effect of the current<br>
invention is also observed in the absence of such a curing catalyst.<br>
Coating compositions C, D, and 9<br>
Comparative coating compositions C and D and coating composition 9<br>
according to the invention were prepared from the ingredients as shown in<br>
Table 4; the amount of ingredients is given in parts by weight. The coating<br>
compositions were prepared as described above for compositions 5 to 8.<br>
DBTDL in Proglyde DMM and the thiol functional compound were pre-mixed<br>

Clear coat compositions C, D, and 9 were spray applied on a base coat<br>
immediately after preparation as described above for compositions 5 to 8. The<br>
clear coats were allowed to cure at room temperature. Table 5 summarizes<br>
the results obtained:<br><br>

From Table 5 it can be inferred that the drying speed can increased by<br>
increasing the amount of curing catalyst in the composition (comparative<br>
examples C and D), even without severe deterioration of the appearance.<br>
However, in a furthertest comparative composition D and composition 9 were<br>
applied again one hour after mixing the components and cured at 60Â°C for 20<br>
minutes. After one hour of pot life comparative composition D leads to a clear<br>
coat having a lower DOI value, i.e. inferior appearance than the clear coat<br>
prepared from composition 9 according to the invention. Thus, the<br>
improvement of cure speed of comparative composition D is achieved at the<br>
expense of pot life, whereas composition 9 offers a good balance of pot life,<br>
cure speed, and appearance. It is particularly noteworthy that coating<br>
composition 9 according to the invention still has a good pot life, although it<br>
comprises amine (present in polyester polyol dispersion 2), a tin catalyst, a<br>
polyisocyanate, and a polyester polyol, and a thiol functional compound. From<br>
the teaching of US 4,788,083, discussed above, one would expect that such a<br>
composition has a short potlife due to deblocking of the tin catalyst by amine.<br>
Coating compositions E to G and 10 to 14<br>
Comparative coating compositions E to G and coating compositions 10 to 14<br>
according to the invention were prepared from the ingredients as shown in<br>
Table 6; the amount of ingredients is given in parts by weight. The coating<br>
compositions were prepared as described above for composition 9. It should<br>
be noted that in this case a 2 weight-% solution of DBTDL in Proglyde DMM<br>
was used.<br><br>

Comparative clear coat compositions E to G and coating compositions 10 to<br>
14 according to the invention were spray applied on a base coat immediately<br>
after preparation as described above for compositions 5 to 8. After flash-off<br>
the panels were placed in a curing chamber having a temperature of 60Â°C.<br>
After 15 minutes in the curing chamber the tackiness of the warm clear coats<br>
was determined manually. This was repeated at intervals of approximately 5<br>
minutes. When the panels did not feel tacky any more, which corresponds to<br>
drying stage 8 defined above, the panels were removed from the curing<br>
chamber. The time required to reach this drying stage is recorded in Table 7<br><br>
WO 2006/064035	PCT/EP2005/056808<br>

below. Table 7 also summarizes the film appearances of the clear coats<br>
tested.<br><br>

Examples E and F demonstrate that the curing rate of a coating composition<br>
can be increased by using a higher amount of catalyst. However, the increase<br>
in curing rate is obtained at the expense of an inferior film appearance.<br>
Example 10 only differs from Example F by the presence of a thio-functional<br>
compound. The clear coat of Example 10 according to the invention exhibits<br>
an improved balance of curing rate and film appearance. Comparative<br>
Example G shows that the curing rate can be further increased by using an<br>
even higher amount of catalyst, leading to an even more severe deterioration<br>
of the film appearance. Examples 11 to 14 demonstrate that even with the<br>
highest catalyst load an improvement of the balance of curing rate and<br>
appearance can be obtained. Whereas this improvement is also clearly visible<br>
for the tetrafunctional PTMP, even better results can be achieved with the<br>
monofunctional 1-dodecane thiol. Examples 12 to 14 demonstrate the effect of<br>
varying amounts of the thiol-functional compound. Although the improvement<br>
of the balance of curing rate and appearance is present at all levels of thiol-<br>
functional compound, in this case optimum results were obtained with the<br>
intermediate level of Example 12.<br><br>
