METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ENHANCED UPLINK DATA TRANSMISSION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to TDD CDMA communication system, and more paiticulaiiy, to a method and appai'atus for enhanced uplink data ti*ansmission in TDD CDMA communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, in order to satisfy the diverse demands of mobile subscribers, not only higher downlink transmission data rate, but also higher uplink transmission data rate is required in 30 communication system. HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) is packet-based data semce, which enhances downhnk transmission of mobile data. For the downlink channel (5MHz bandwidth) in WCDMA system, the maximum transmission data rate supported by HSDPA can be up to 10Mbps. The key technologies which HSDPA adopts are Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ), EUL (Enhanced Uplink) technology is proposed to improve uplink transmission data rate under the support of E-DCH (Enhanced-Dedicated Channel) technology. Nevertheless, in existing TDD specifications, there is no detailed definition for the physical layer architecture of E-DCH.<br>
In addition, during traditional uplink data transmission, one issue is that the uplink channel is not allowed to be dynamically changed any more, once allocated. However, there would be considerable imbalance for traffic rate of uplink data, for instance, during communication process, when huge volume of data is needed to be transmitted, the capacity of the allocated channel can not satisfy the demands for ti'ansmitting such large amount of data, and when small volume of data transmission is needed, the spai*e channel resource will be wasted.<br>
Therefore, a complete solution of method and apparatus for enhanced uplink data ti'ansmission is needed, which enables mobile terminal to conduct efficient uphnk transmission.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for enhanced uphnk data ti'ansmission, which can dynamically allocate uplink channel, so as to enable<br>

According to the present invention, it is provided a method used for enhanced uplink data transmission in user equipment (UE), comprising the steps of: acquiring at least one dedicated uplink channel, which is allocated by the radio access network (RAN) according to communication status of the UE; performing uplink data transmission on the dedicated uphnk channel; according to allocation information of the RAN and communication status of the UE, dynamically adjusting the number of the dedicated uplink channels to enable the UE to conduct uplink data transmission on the adjusted dedicated uplink channels.<br>
According to the present invention, it is provided a UE comprising: a data transmission apparatus, for conducting uplink data transmission to a RAN on at least one dedicated uplink channel; an adjusting appai*atus, for adjusting the number of dedicated uphnk channels according to allocation information relating to the UE sent from the RAN, so as to enable the transmission apparatus to conduct uplink data transmission on adjusted dedicated uphnk channels.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Detailed descriptions will be given below to the present invention in conjunction with specific embodiments and accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic diagram illustrating physical channel configuration of enhanced uplink data ti'ansmission according to an embodiment of the present invention. UE(User Equipment) transmits uplink data on at least one enhanced uplink dedicated physical channel, which  is called E-PUDCH  (Enhanced Physical Uplink Dedicated<br>
Channel) in the present invention and is used for transmitting uplink data to RAN (Radio Access Network), in the meanwhile, E-PUDCH can also be used for sending uplink feedback information to RAN, and the relevant feedback information includes transmission control signal. Alternatively, UE can also send uplink feedback information to RAN on<br>
 <br>
enhanced share information channel, which is called E-SICH (Enhanced Shared Information Channel) in the present invention. E-SICH is an uplink channel, used for sending feedback information from UE to RAN, wherein the relevant feedback information includes: transmission type, the size of transmission block, HARQ related information including HARQ process identifier, new data indicator and incremental redundancy version number. Since E-PUDCH can not only transmit uplink data, but also send uplink feedback inforaiation, E-SICH is therefore an optional channel. RAN send conti'ol information to UE through enhanced share control channel, which is called E-SCCH (Enhanced Shared Control Channel) in the present invention. E-SCCH is a downlink channel, which is used for RAN (Radio Access Network) to send control information to UE. The relevant control information includes: UE identifier, ACK/NAK (Acknowledgement/ Not-Acknowledgement) and TPC (Transmit Power Conti'ol). In addition, an EUL-associated uplink DPCH (Dedicated Physical Channel) is used for sending synchi'onization request and power conti'ol request from UE to RAN, and an EUL-associated downlink DPCH is used for sending SS (Synchronization Shift) TPC information from RAN to UE.<br>
Through E-PUDCH provided according to an embodiment of the present invention, UE is enabled to perform enhanced uplink data ti*ansmission to RAN, and in . the meanwhile, the number of E-PUDCHs could be dynamically allocated and adjusted according to UE's communication status after the number is allocated, which makes UE implement more efficient uphnk data transmission. The detailed implementation is described with the conjunction of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.<br>
Fig.2 shows a flowchart illustrating enhanced uplink data transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention. Firstly, UE establishes RRC (Radio Resource Control) connection with RAN (step SllO), wherein RRC connection is a kind of bidirectional point-to-point connection between RRC protocol layer of UE and RAN. For a communicating UE, there is one RRC connection at most. RRC connection transmits the wireless network signaling between UE and RAN, e.g., allocation of wireless resource and the like. RRC connection is estabhshed when call is initially established and released after the communication is ended, between which the RRC connection needs to be maintained.<br>
UE monitors E-SCCH to obtain E-PUDCH resource allocation inforaiation (step S120); then judges if E-PUDCH is allocated to UE (step S140); if not, UE maintains SS and TPC through EUL-associated DPCH (step SMS).<br>
 <br>
If yes, UE executes EUL data transmission, which is described in detail as following: first, UE (or RAN) chooses AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) transmission mode (step S150); then, UE ti-ansmits data on E-PUDCH(step S160) and transmits uplink control information on E-PUDCH or E-SICH (step S170); after receiving the data from UE, RAN sends TPC and SS (Synchronization Shift) through E-SCCH (step SI 80), then, according to the communication status of the UE performing uplink data ti*ansmission, RAN dynamically allocates E-PUDCH resources (step S190); According to RAM's E-PUDCH allocation information, UE dynamically adjusts the number of E-PUDCHs (step S195); Eventually, UE judges if the data transmission is completed (step S200), if yes, relating wireless resoui'ces will be released (step S210), if no, UE returns to step S140, and judges if E-PUDCH has been allocated to itself.<br>
Fig.3 shows a flowchart illustrating dynamical E-PUDCH resource allocation according to an embodiment of the present invention. To be simplicity, firstly some relevant pai-ameters are defined as following: Q denotes real-time communication quality of the channel occupied by the conununicating UE; P denotes the UE's QoS (Quality of Service) level, that is different types of services are queued into different QoS queues, which makes transmission priority for some services (e.g. voice service) higher than other seT"vices (e.g. data service), so as to reduce transmission latency and guai'antee the real time transmission quality; N denotes the number of all UEs conducting the enhanced uplink transmission in wireless network; S denotes the number of all E-PUDCHs which are allocated by RAN to the UE for conducting enhanced uplink transmission .<br>
The assignment/re-assignment of the number of E-PUDCHs acquired by each UE will be based on the Q, P, N and S value. The approaches for RAN to acquire these parameters are as follows: RAN measures UEs' uplink channel quality to get P; Q is directly extracted fi*om UE's QoS level or service type; S is extracted from RRC (Radio Resource Control) information of RAN; N is yielded according to the number of UEs conducting the EUL transmission currently.<br>
For every UE conducting the enhanced uplink transmission, RAN will allocate/re-allocate the suitable number of E-PUDCHs according to following two basic principles:<br>
1. If the UE has a higher P*Q value (P*Q is a synthetic parameter used to denote the quality of channel and QoS level), it will be allocated more E-PUDCHs, otherwise it will be allocated less E-PUDCHs.<br>
 <br>
2. If the N value is smaller in the cell, that means there are a few UEs conducting EUL transmission, the cell will be allocated more E-PUDCHs, othei-wise it will be allocated less E-PUDCHs.<br>
The following shows the proposed procedure for dynamical allocation of the E-PUDCH resource shown in Fig.3:<br>
RAN obtains parameter S, P, Q and N (step S310);<br>
RAN allocates all the E-PUDECH resource units according to the P*Q value and current N value (step S320);<br>
The UEs conduct the EUL transmission on E-PUDCH(step S330);<br>
RAN judges if the value of S is changed (step S340);<br>
If S is changed, the UE judges if S is increased (step S350), i.e. judges if RAN gets new E-PUDCH resources. If yes, the new available E-PUDCH resource in S domain (i.e. inside RAN coverage area) will be re-allocated (step S370); if no, S is decreased, RAN requests the UE with the smallest P*Q value to release E-PUDCH resources and remove these resources from S domain (step S360). If S value is unchanged, then UE judges if N value is changed (step S380), i.e. judges if the number of all UEs conducting EUL transmission in RAN is changed.<br>
If N value is changed, UE judges if N is increased (step S390), that is judging if the number of UEs conducting EUL transmission is increased; if yes, RAN will request the UE with the smallest P*Q value to release E-PUDCH resources and allocate the released resources to the new accessed UEs (step S410); if not, RAN will reallocate the new released resources (step S400); if N value is unchanged, UE judges if P*Q value is changed, (step S420).<br>
If P*Q value is changed, that is the synthetic parameter of the channel quality and QoS level parameter changes, RAN will reallocate all the resouixes in S domain according to cuiTently P*Q value of each UE and the number of UEs conducting EUL transmission (step S430); if P*Q is unchanged, then UE judges if transmission has completed(step S440); if yes, the relevant occupied wireless resources will be released (step S450); if not, then go back to step S330 and continue EUL ti'ansmission on E-PUDCH.<br>
Fig.4 shows schematic diagram illustrating the timeslot of enhanced uphnk data transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment, five timeslots (TS) (TS2-TS6) in one sub-frame are assigned for E-DCH ti'ansmission. At most five TSs per sub-frame can be allocated for E-DCH, because one TS must be sei"ved for the<br>
 <br>
' EUL-associatedDPCHs.<br>
Fig.5 shows a schematic diagram illustrating dynamical allocation of E-PUDCH resources according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.5, the allocation status of code channels in different sub-frame when E-PUDCH resources are dynamically allocated to one "target" UE is provided (the grey area represents the code channel has been occupied). During sub-frame n and n-i-1: the target UE has the supposed smallest P*Q value, so the UE is allocated only one code channel; In sub-frame n-^2: a new UE requests to conduct enhanced uplink transmission, so the target UE is requested to release its code channel because it has the smallest P*Q value. As a result, the target UE pauses the enhanced uplink transmission due to only one code channel available; In sub-frame n-f3: the parameters ( S, P, Q, N) keep unvaried; In sub-frame n-f4: the target UE's channel quality gets improved and the target UE has a much higher P*Q value, so it is allocated more E-PUDCH resources.<br>
Fig.6 is a block diagram of an appai'atus used for enhanced uplink data ti'ansmission according to an embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment describes the functional blocks of UE and RAN with precondition that RAN 2 determines the transmission type. UE 1 comprises data transmission unit 11 and DPCH adjusting unit 12, in which data transmission unit 11 is used for conducting enhanced uplink ti'ansmission on E-PUDCH, and DPCH adjusting unit 12 is used to dynamically adjust E-PUDCH resources accordingly.<br>
RAN2 comprises measurement unit 21, monitoring unit 211, transmission type selection unit 22, TFI (Transport Format Infonnation) setting unit 23, receiving unit 24 and DPCH allocating unit 25; in which measurement unit 21 is used to measure the quality of UE1 uplink channel, monitoring unit 211 is used to monitor the value of Q,P,N and S shown in above Fig.3; transmission type selection unit 22 is used to select transmission type according to the quality of the UE 1 uplink channel. When channel quality is good with unvaried transmission power, we can select high-order modulation and relating encoding (e.g. 64QAM , % channel coding), or decrease ti'ansmission power when using low-order modulation and relating encoding (e.g. BPSK, Vi channel encoding). TFI setting unit 23 is used to modify the transmission type contained in TFI information according to the selected transmission type. Demodulation unit 24 is used for receiving and demodulating data transmitted by UETs data transmission unit 11 according to transmission type. DPCH allocating unit 25 is used to dynamically allocate E-PUDCH<br>
 <br>
'  resource.<br>
When UEl starts to conduct enhanced uplink transmission, measurement unit 21 measures the quality of uphnk channels of UEl, and according to the quality of the UETs uplink channel, transmission type selection unit 22 selects appropriate transmission type and informs TFI setting unit 23 to modify the transmission type contained in TFT information, in the meanwhile data transmission unit 11 conducts enhanced uplink ti*ansmission according to the transmission type, and the data will be sent to demodulation unit 24 that demodulates the data according to the transmission type. During above enhanced uplink transmission process, based on the parameter value monitored by monitoring unit 211 and the method shown in Fig. 3, DPCH allocating unit 25 will dynamically allocate E-PUDCH resources to UEl, while DPCH adjusting unit 12 adjusts the number of E-PUDCH used by it own according to E-PUDCH resource allocation information.<br>
Fig.7 is a block diagram of an apparatus used for enhanced uplink data transmission according to another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment describes the functional blocks of UE and RAN with precondition that UEl' determines the transmission type. UE r comprises data transmission unit 11', DPCH adjusting unit 12', measurement unit 21', ti'ansmission type selection unit 22' and TFI setting unit 23', RAN2' comprises monitoring unit 211', receiving unit 24' and DPCH allocating unit 25'. Since the functions of the units are same as that in Fig. 6, the detail description is omitted. In TDD communication system, uplink and downlink transmission are implemented on same fi'equencies, so the quahty of uplink channel can be acquired by measuring the quality of downlink channels.<br>
When UEl starts to conduct enhanced uplink transmission, measurement unit 21' measures the quality of downlink channels, and according to the quality of the UETs downlink channel, transmission type selection unit 22' selects appropriate ti-ansmission type and inform TFI setting unit 23' to modify the transmission type contained in TFI information, and meanwhile, data transmission unit 11' conducts enhanced uplink ti-ansmission according to the transmission type, and the data will be sent to receiving unit 24' that demodulates the data according to the transmission type sent by TFI setting unit 23'. During above enhanced uplink transmission process, based on the parameter value monitored by monitoring unit 211' and the method shown in Fig. 3, DPCH allocating unit 25' will dynamically allocate E-PUDCH resources to UEl', while DPCH adjusting unit 12'<br>
