COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING INFECTION IN CATTLE AND SWINE<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals. More particularly, the invention relates to a composition containing an antibiotic for use in the treatment of bacterial infections in animals such as cattle, sheep and swine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.<br>
Widespread infection of cattle or other animals in a feedlot, the commingling of calves or other livestock from different sources causes the calves and other animals to be exposed to pathogens for which immunity has not developed. The stresses of shipping and change in diet reduces the calves' and other animals' immune defenses. Additionally, the poor weather of autumn, when calves or other livestock are usually moved from pastures to feedlots, further increases the risk of illness. Together, these circumstances result in a high incidence of respiratory disease in the cattle or other animals when they first arrive at the feedlot and soon thereafter. It has become common to administer antimicrobial drugs to calves and other feedlot animals at the time of arrival into a feedlot, in order to reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory illness in the feedlot cattle and other stock.<br>
Without the use of antimicrobial agents, bovine respiratory disease (BRD), often referred to as the "bovine respiratory diseases complex" due to the multifactorial etiology has been one of the leading causes of economic loss to both the dairy and beef industries throughout the world. Excessive mortality, reduced weight gains, and the cost of treatment and prevention have placed a heavy burden on the industry.<br>
The cost of death losses due to respiratory diseases vary around the world. Death losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $1 billion annually. Losses in<br><br>
various European countries range from $75 to $120 million. Cattle with clinical or sub-clinical BRD do not gain weight or produce milk as well as healthy animals. Beef cattle with BRD gain less weight, have reduced feed efficiency and often produce a lower grade carcass at slaughter. Perino L.J. and Apley MM Bovine Respiratory Disease, in CURRENT VETERINARY THERAPY 4 (FOOD ANIMAL PRACTICE), 4TH ED., 446-455 (Howard J.L, Smith RA, eds., 1999). A direct correlation between pulmonary lesions observed at slaughter and reduced weight gains has been established in cattle with sub-clinical infections. Whittem T.E. et a/., J. Am. Vet Med. Assoc, 209:814-818 (1996).<br>
In addition to the production losses associated with mortality and morbidity, significant costs are associated with the treatment of BRD due to the costs of various therapeutic agents and the labor required to administer these agents, along with the extra labor to isolate and observe these animals.<br>
The pathogenesis of BRD is thought to be due to the interaction of environmental and physiological stresses coupled with infectious agents, such as Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytha, Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus somnus that are considered part of the normal flora of the bovine upper respiratory tract. When environmental and physiological stress factors reduce the natural resistance, and inhibit the pulmonary defense mechanisms, these above organisms proliferate and colonize the lower respiratory tract. In addition, various bovine viruses such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3) are known to have immunosuppressive effects in the lung.<br>
Similarly, swine respiratory disease (SRD) also has a multifactional etiology. Bacterial infections caused by P. multocida, H. parasuis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella cholerasuis and Mycoplasma sp. may result in respiratory disease in swine, resulting in significant economic losses. Stresses such as c'rowding, mixing and moving of pigs and transient viral infections may contribute to the intensification of the disease.<br><br>
Any of the pathogens listed as possibly implicated in BRD or SRD may stimulate an excessive inflammatory process in the lungs by producing various toxins that stimulate the release of various cytokines, which up-regulate the inflammatory process, resulting in death or morbidity. M. haemolytica, considered the most virulent of these various organisms, also produces a leukotoxin that inhibits phagocytosis by leukocytes, thus further enhancing its ability to colonize the lower respiratory tract. This process often results in a bacterial bronchopneumonia.<br>
Damage to host tissues caused by invading pathogens occur as neutrophils, pulmonary alveolar macrophages and natural killer cells destroy infected cells. As cell membranes are damaged, arachidonic acid is released. Arachidonic acid is the substrate for the formation of various prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. The release of these biological active substances is critical to driving the inflammatory response that results in pulmonary lesions. Mosier DA, Vet Clin. North Am. Food Animal Prac, 13:483-493 (1997).<br>
In general, therapy for BRD should be directed at achieving the following<br>
goals:<br>
1.	Controlling the infection - In animals where the infectious process is halted early, the need for repeat treatment is significantly reduced (see Apley M.D. &amp; Fajt V.R., Vet Clin. North Am. Food Anim. Prac, 14:291-313 (1998)). The selection of the appropriate antimicrobial compound should be based on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the organism involved, the levels of the antimicrobial agent in the respiratory tract, the ease of administration, the potential for injection site tissue damage, and a dosing regime that minimizes the pain and stress associated with treatment.<br>
2.	Minimize the pulmonary damage - As the level of inflammation and subsequent pulmonary damage increases, the probability of repeat therapy increases and the rate of weight gain.decreases. Lekeux P., Bovine Practitioner, 29:71-75 (1995); Scott P.R., J. Dairy ScL, 76(2):414-420 (1993).<br><br>
3. Reduce pyrexia (fever) - Controlling the infection and reducing the inflammation will reduce the pyrexia, thus increasing the potential for recovery. The feeling of well-being that accompanies the reduction of pyrexia may also improve the intake of nutrients by suppressing inappetence associated with disease and pyrexia.<br>
For years, antimicrobial therapy has been the mainstay of BRD therapy. There are many effective antimicrobial agents currently available for the treatment of BRD. NUFLOR®, an injectable formulation of the broad-spectrum antibiotic florfenicol, has emerged as one of the leading antibiotics on a global basis. NUFLOR® may be administered subcutaneously as well as intramuscularly. It is indicated for the treatment and control of BRD associated with M haemolytica, P. multocida and H. somnus as well as for the prevention of respiratory disease in cattle at high risk of developing BRD associated with these bacteria. NUFLOR® is also indicated for the treatment of bovine interdigital phlegmon (footrot, acute interdigital necrobacillosis, infectious pododermatitis) associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus.<br>
There is a need for conveniently administered, stable compositions that may control and prevent the infections associated with bovine respiratory disease and other infectious diseases.<br>

Fluorine-containing analogs of antibiotics chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have been shown to have antibiotic activity, both against organisms sensitive to and resistant to chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. See Schafer, T.W. et a/., "Novel Fluorine-Containing Analogs of Chloramphenicol and Thiamphenicol: Antibacterial and Biological Properties," in CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH ICC AND THE 1 9TH ICAAC AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MICROBIOLOGY 1980,444-446. Examples of such compounds, and methods for their manufacture, are described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,235,892. The medical profession has become increasingly concerned about the transference of bacterial resistance to humans when antibiotics useful in<br><br>
treating humans are administered to livestock. Because the chloramphenicol group of antibiotics is infrequently used now to treat humans, its derivatives are particularly appropriate for veterinary use. Of particular interest are the 3-fluoro, 3-deoxy derivatives.<br>

In order to prepare the composition of the present invention, the vehicle(s) or a portion of the vehicle(s), are added to the compounding vessel, followed by the remaining excipients and the actives. The mixture is mixed until all solids are dissolved or in suspension. Additional solvent(s) to bring the composition to final volume may be added if needed. Additives, such as those listed above, may also be included in the vessel and mixed into the formulation (the order of addition is not critical).<br><br>
The compositions according to the present invention will generally be administered to cattle at from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of the antibacterial agent(s) per kilogram of body weight. Preferably the compositions of the present invention will be administered to bovines at from about 20 mg to about 50 mg of the antibacterial agent(s) per kilogram of body weight. More preferably the dose will be about 40 mg/kg of the antibacterial agent administered once subcutaneously. Also preferable is the administration of two doses of 20 mg/kg administered at time 0 and 48 hours post initial administration. The compositions according to the present invention will generally be administered to swine at a dose of from 15 mg to about 100 mg of the antibacterial agent per kilogram of body weight. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention will be administered to swine at from about 20 mg to about 50 mg of the antibacterial agent per kilogram of body weight.<br>
The compositions may be administered once daily or divided into multiple doses. Often only one dose will be sufficient to treat the infection. In some circumstances, one dose followed by a second dose 48 hours later will be required to treat the animal. The precise dose will depend on the stage and severity of the infection, the susceptibility of the infecting organism to the composition, and the individual characteristics of the animal species being treated, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are particularly useful<br>
for cattle and other bovids, swine, and other large mammals. In addition to the<br>
treatment of bovine respiratory disease, the compositions of this invention are also<br>
suitable for the treatment of infectious diseases such as swine respiratory disease,<br>
footrot, acute mastitis, pinkeye (infectious keratoconjunctivitis), acute pneumonia,<br>
metritis and enteritis. The dosage regimen for treatment of such diseases would be<br>
as described above,	-<br>
Mastitis is a complex disease that occurs in lactating females, and is of Darticular economic importancein dairy cows and goats. Several pathogenic agents may be involved, including Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and streptococci. The acute form of mastitis has a sudden onset, the udder is enlarged, hot to the<br><br>
touch and tender; usually the affected animal will have a fever. If not treated promptly, the udder may be permanently damaged and milk production decreased or lost.<br>
Pinkeye is an acute infectious disease of cattle, sheep and other animals that is characterized by inflammation of the tissues of the eye, accompanied by nasal discharge, lacrimation and copious ocular discharge. Affected animals may display extreme discomfort, resulting in a drop in milk production among dairy cattle; in extreme cases permanent blindness occurs. The disease, which is caused by Moraxella bovis in cattle, is widespread, especially among range and feedlot cattle, and is of great economic importance to the cattle industry.<br>
Footrot (interdigital phlegmon) is an acute infection of the interdigital space that occurs throughout the world in both beef and dairy cattle. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the major cause of footrot, although other organisms, including Bacteroides melaninogenicus, may be involved. The major symptoms include pain, severe lameness, fever, anorexia, and reduced milk production.<br>
Currently, footrot is treated by antibiotic therapy; recommended therapy may involve treatment for up to five days. The use of the formulations of the present-invention for the treatment of footrot would be an improvement over presently known treatments because it would provide the proven efficacy of florfenicol, with fewer administrations.       The compositions of the present invention are also useful for the prevention of these diseases in animals at high risk of developing those diseases. For example, the presently-claimed compositions may be administered to cattle at high risk of developing bovine respiratory disease at the same dosages recommended for treatment of bovine respiratory disease.<br>
The formulations of the present invention have many significant advantages. The formulations containing triacetin and dimethylacetamide display an improved pharmacokinetic profile as well as sustained blood levels of florfenicol in the subject. In addition, a significant decrease in the variability of the subject-to-subject pharmacokinetic profiles and improved site reaction at the site of injection with less irritation and post injection inflammation were experienced. Further, the<br><br><br><br>
The ingredients may be mixed in a single or multiple steps. The florfenicol was mixed with dimethylacetamide and then triacetin was added to the mixture.<br>
Example 3<br>
Twenty-four head of cattle were used in the study as described below and were administered the formulations of the present invention. Serial blood samples were drawn at time 0 prior to dosing, then at 0.5,1,3,6, 9, 12, 24, 36,48, 60 and 72 hours post injection. The animals received one of the following treatment regimens.<br><br>
The injection site was assessed daily for the length, width and depth of the lesion and findings were recorded on the Lesion Evaluation Form.<br>
The study was carried out in bovines of approximately 6 months of age or more that weigh about 125 kg or more. Selection was based on health status appearance, tractability and body weight. Animals exhibiting abnormal clinical signs prior to the start of the study were not included in the study. Animals that had received medication or have participated in another study in the previous 14 days were excluded from this study.<br>
Baseline data was collected prior to initiating the study. Daily observations preclinical signs began on the first day of acclimation and continued until the study was terminated. All of the animals were weighed and physical examined, and health evaluation was conducted by a veterinarian on Day-7 (if acclimation is necessary) and on Day-1 if the cattle were already acclimated.<br><br><br>
Plasma Levels of florfenicol were taken as follows: Approximately 10 mL of blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture into a Vacutainer® tube containing sodium EDTA and processed for plasma.<br>
Pharmacokinetic Analysis was carried out as follows: Plasma concentrations of florfenicol was reported in the appropriate units (i.e. pg/ml or ng/mL). Plasma florfenicol concentration versus time data was graphically presented for each individual animal, and as mean concentrations for the overall sample population.<br>
Disclosed in Figure 1 is the plasma concentration of florfenicol vs. time in six cattle after subcutaneous administration of a florfenicol solution at a dose of 40 mg per kg of body weight. Mean peak concentration (Cmax) was 6366 ng/mL, preferably in a range of 5076-6995 ng/mL. Mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 5.5 hrs, preferably in a range of 3-6 hrs.<br>
Disclosed in Figure 2 is the plasma concentration of florfenicol vs. time in six cattle after subcutaneous administration of a florfenicol solution at a dose of 40 mg per kg of body weight. Mean peak concentration (Cmax) was 4248 ng/mL, preferably in range of 3457-4996 ng/mL. Mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 3.67 hrs, preferably in a range of 1-9 hrs.<br>
This data displays that the formulations of the present invention have a number of substantial benefits. There is decreased tissue swelling at the site of injection. There is also a decrease in the volume of the injection that is administered. Also, there was low variation amongst subjects in the blood levels achieved.<br>
Although certain presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains that variations and modifications of the described embodiments may be made without departing fern the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only to the extent required by the appended claims and the applicable rules of law.<br><br><br>
