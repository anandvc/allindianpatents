				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a front panel display module for use with a refrigerator. In particular, this invention relates to a front panel display module to provide a visual display of the operational status of the refrigerator<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is presently known to provide a relay and overload protector, which disconnects the compressor of the refrigerator from the power source in the instance of the temperature of the compressor exceeding a predetermined value. Further, a thermostat is normally provided inside the cabinet of the refrigerator, which regulates the temperature within the cabinet. Thus, whenever the temperature inside the cabinet is lower than the set value of the thermostat, the compressor is disconnected from the power source. A disadvantage in the known refrigerator is that no display means were provided to indicate as to whether the compressor is in an operative status.<br>
In the known refrigerators, a lamp is normally provided inside the cabinet and connected to the power source through a door switch. Thus, only when the door was in an open status, the cabinet lamp was connected to the power source. A disadvantage of such a construction is the absence of a display to indicate the status of the door. Yet another disadvantage is that no signal means were provided in the event that the door was unintentionally left in an open status.<br>
Another disadvantage in the known refrigerators is that no display means were provided to reflect as to whether power was present in the power source.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a front panel display means for providing the operational status of a refrigerator.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a front panel display means to provide a visual status as* to whether the compressor of the refrigerator is connected to the power source.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a front panel display means to provide a visual status on the opening or closure of the refrigerator door.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a front panel display means to provide a visual status which is efficient.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propse a front panel display means to provide a visual status as to whether the door is in an open status and further includes audio means whicms operable in the event that the door is open beyond a prescribed period.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a front panel display module for use with a refrigerator comprising:<br>
(a)	a control panel (CP) provided with Time switch (TS), select switch<br>
(SS) and three indicator lamps (L2, L3, 14), wherein lamp (1,2) is<br>
adapted to indicate functional status of compressor (CoM), lamp (La)<br>
being adapted to indicate whether power supply (PS) is ON or OFF<br>
and  lamp (L4) being adapted to indicate whether door of the<br>
refeigerator is open or closed and wherein said select switch has set<br>
of keys for real time in hours and minutes, alarm time in hours and<br>
minutes, and alarm ON/OFF;<br>
(b)	a relay (RLi) through which compressor (CoM) is connected to<br>
power source (PS) wherein said relay is adapted to disconnect the<br>
said compressor when its temperature exceeds a predetermined<br>
••<br>
temperature and due to overload protector (OP1);<br>
 (c) a power supply battery back up module (MPS) comprising live terminal and neutral terminal connected to refrigerator circuit, the said terminals being connected to isolating transformer (T) which is connected to rectifier (R) connected to a filter (F) and regulator (RG) which is further connected to a frequency compensator (FC) connected to back up supply (BS) through back up switch over control (BSC), input terminals being connected to output terminals of back up supply through Current Limiter (CL) and Isolator (I) being provided to connect the back up power supply for the compressor switch/thermostat (T1) and door switch (DS), and wherein the output terminal of said back up switch over control (BSC), isolators (I) and sound transducer (ST) are adapted to be connected to the display module.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the refrigerator circuit is connected to the first lamp through said module having a current limitor and isolator. The first lamp provides the status of the compressor and as to whether it is disconnected from the power source due to overload or by the thermostat provided in the cabinet of the refrigerator. For this purpose, the known refrigerator circuit normally employed in a refrigerator is employed.<br>
The second lamp provides an indication as to whether the door of the refrigerator is in an open or closed status and also connected to the known refrigerator circuit through said module having a current limitor and isolator. Additionally, a sound transducer is connected to the display module to provide an audio signal in the event that the door remains unintentionally open.<br>
The display module has a clock connected to the main power source through the module having a step down transformer and circuits normally provided for operation of the clock.<br>
A further lamp is provided for an indication as to whether power is present in the power source.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be<br>
more  apparent from the ensuing  description  with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.l  shows the circuit diagram of  the  present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig.2  shows the block diagram of the back up power<br>
supply and<br>
Referring to the drawings the main power supply source MPS is adapted to be connected to the control panel CP<br>
having a plurality of lamps L , L and L , time switch<br>
TS and select switch SS.  L is the lamp to indicate the<br><br><br>
function status of the compressor CoM.  Lamp L glowe<br>
when compressor CoM is not connected to power source PS.<br>
- 7 -Compressor COM is connected to the power source PS<br>
through a relay RL .  Thus, when the temperature of<br>
1 compressor exceeds a predetermined temperature, and due<br>
to overload protector OP , relay RL  disconnects  the<br>
1 compressor CoM from the power source PS.  Thus,  when<br>
relay RL  is open, lamp L is connected to the power<br>
1	2<br>
source PS.   The status of compressor CoM is also<br>
controlled  by thermostat T  whose functioning  is<br>
1 dependent  on the temperature inside the cabinet of  the<br>
refrigerator.<br>
As shown in fig. 2 the back up power supply comprises the life terminal and neutral terminal to be connected to the refrigerator circuit. These terminals are connected to isolating transformer T which is connected to a rectifier R connected to a filter F and a regulator RG connected to a frequency compensator FC which is connected to back up switch over supply BS. The module has input terminals to connect the back up power supply for the compressor switch/thermostat Tl and door switch DS. These inputs are connected to the output terminal of the back up module through a current limitor CL being connected to an isolator I respectively. The output terminal of the back up switch over control BSC, isolator and sound transducer are adapted to be connected to the display module having the indicating lamps provided therewith.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
