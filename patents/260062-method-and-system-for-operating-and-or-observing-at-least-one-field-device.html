Description<br>
Method and automation system for operating and/or observing at<br>
least one field device<br>
In order to control a wide variety of systems and processes,<br>
so-called automation systems are generally used nowadays. The<br>
systems and processes to be controlled may be, for example,<br>
chemical or industrial processes, industrial manufacturing<br>
processes or distribution processes for energy, gas or water.<br>
It may also be a distribution process for items of information<br>
via data or communications networks.<br>
Such systems and processes which are to be controlled in<br>
automated fashion often have so-called field devices fitted in<br>
the vicinity of the process by means of which measurement<br>
signals are picked up from the process or the system and by<br>
means of which it is possible to influence the process or the<br>
system using actuators. Such field devices may be, for example,<br>
control or protection field devices, whereby the term "field<br>
device" is not restricted exclusively to a use in the field,<br>
but may also include, for example, those devices which are used<br>
in buildings automation or in telecommunications systems.<br>
Said field devices are often connected, via data links, to a<br>
central control device, from which they receive commands to be<br>
implemented and to which they pass on measurement data and<br>
messages generated from picked-up measurement signals.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 2 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
In order to minimize the risk of failure of an automation<br>
system, various components are generally designed to be<br>
redundant, i.e. to be at least in duplicate, with the result<br>
that, in the event of failure of a first component, the<br>
corresponding function can be taken over by a redundant<br>
component. Thus, for example, the data link between a central<br>
control device and the field devices is usually designed to be<br>
redundant. This may mean, for example, that all data lines are<br>
provided in duplicate or are formed in a ring structure.<br>
Furthermore, central control devices are generally also<br>
designed to be redundant. For this purpose it is generally<br>
conventional to provide two central control devices, of which<br>
one, as the leading central control device, normally takes on<br>
the function of the complete control of the automation system.<br>
Via a high-performance synchronization data transmission line,<br>
this leading central control device is connected to a further<br>
central control device, which carries out precisely the same<br>
actions, synchronized in time, as the leading central control<br>
device. In the event of the leading central control device<br>
failing, it is then possible simply to switch over to the<br>
further central control device, and the automation system can<br>
continue to be operated without any interruption.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method and<br>
an automation system for operating and/or observing at least<br>
one field device which can be run with as little complexity as<br>
possible.<br>
In order to achieve this object as regards the method, the<br>
invention proposes a method for operating and/or observing at<br>
least one field device, in which a first central control device<br>
implementing automation software<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 3 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
produces a first command for controlling the at least one field<br>
device and transmits this first command to the at least one<br>
field device, at least one further central control device<br>
implementing the automation software produces a second similar<br>
command for controlling the at least one field device and<br>
transmits this second command to the at least one field device,<br>
and the at least one field device receives the transmitted<br>
first and second commands and implements at least one of the<br>
received commands.<br>
By virtue of the fact that the two central control devices<br>
implement the same automation software independently of one<br>
another and in each case transmit similar first and second<br>
commands to the at least one field device, complex<br>
synchronization of the central control devices is no longer<br>
required.<br>
The method according to the invention is based on the knowledge<br>
that, in most cases, it is possible to dispense with<br>
synchronization of the central control devices since these<br>
implement the same automation software in the same way and<br>
therefore, although they do not function synchronously in time,<br>
they generate similar commands, i.e. ones with the same<br>
contents, and respond in the same way. Although, in the method<br>
according to the invention, some commands are transmitted a<br>
plurality of times to the at least one field device, the field<br>
device repeatedly carrying out a similar command usually<br>
produces only one error message. Thus, for example, a circuit<br>
breaker in an energy distribution network, cannot be tripped<br>
again if it has already been tripped previously.<br>
However, in order that, precisely in the case of complex<br>
automation systems, the at least one field device does not<br>
implement all of the commands<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 4 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
a plurality of times, in accordance with one advantageous<br>
development of the method according to the invention provision<br>
may be made for the at least one field device only to implement<br>
that command of the similar first and second commands which it<br>
receives first. In this case, when a new command is input, the<br>
field device tests whether a similar command has already been<br>
input before and ignores it, if appropriate. As a result, only<br>
those commands are implemented which the field device receives<br>
first. Such a check can be realized comparatively simply, as a<br>
result of which the complexity for the entire automation system<br>
remains low.<br>
If the field device itself also produces messages and<br>
measurement data, for example from measurement signals from<br>
connected sensors, provision may advantageously be made for the<br>
at least one field device to produce measurement data and/or<br>
messages and to transmit them both to the first central control<br>
device and to the at least one further central control device.<br>
In this way, all the central control devices are supplied with<br>
the same input information items from the at least one field<br>
device, as a result of which data matching of the central<br>
control devices with one another is not necessary.<br>
In accordance with one advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, provision may furthermore be made<br>
for the at least one field device, whilst implementing a<br>
received command, to block the acceptance of further commands.<br>
This prevents, for example, a situation in which contradictory<br>
commands are to be implemented virtually simultaneously (for<br>
example opening and closing of a circuit breaker). In addition,<br>
this may prevent a situation in which the implementation of a<br>
command comprising a plurality of individual commands (command<br>
sequence) is interrupted by a command not belonging to the<br>
command sequence.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 5 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
In addition, in accordance with a further advantageous<br>
embodiment of the method according to the invention, provision<br>
may be made for the at least one field device, once a command<br>
has been received, to block the acceptance of a similar command<br>
for a predetermined period of time. In this way, the<br>
implementation of the same command within a predetermined<br>
period of time can be prevented in a very simple manner. Once<br>
the period of time has elapsed, however, the command can be<br>
implemented again. In this case, the period of time should be<br>
such that it only prevents the implementation of those commands<br>
which are produced a plurality of times by the asynchronous<br>
operation of the central control devices.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method according to<br>
the invention also provides for the at least one field device,<br>
in order to check whether a received command has already been<br>
implemented, to store all of the implemented commands in a list<br>
of commands and to check whether this received command is<br>
already stored in the list of commands, and to block the<br>
implementation of those commands which are already stored in<br>
the list of commands.<br>
In this context, in addition provision may also be made for the<br>
at least one field device only to block the implementation of<br>
the last n commands which have been stored in the list of<br>
commands, where n is a predeterminable number of commands. This<br>
in turn ensures that the field device only blocks those<br>
commands which are actually redundant and, after the occurrence<br>
of a command, does not prevent it from ever being implemented.<br>
As an alternative to this, in this context provision may also<br>
be made for stored commands to be deleted again<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 6 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
from the list of commands after a predeterminable period of<br>
time. On the one hand, this in turn achieves a situation in<br>
which only actually redundant commands are not implemented a<br>
plurality of times and, on the other hand, the memory space<br>
requirement of the list of commands is minimized.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
method according to the invention, provision is also made for<br>
the central control devices to receive instructions from local<br>
operating devices associated with them in each case and, from<br>
them, to produce the first and second commands for the at least<br>
one field device; likewise the central control devices receive<br>
measurement data and/or messages from the at least one field<br>
device and transmit them to the local operating devices. In<br>
this way, the central control devices can be operated by means<br>
of local operation.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method according to<br>
the invention provides for the central control devices to<br>
receive instructions from at least one control center device<br>
which is at a higher level than them and, from them, to produce<br>
the first and second commands for the at least one field<br>
device; likewise the central control devices receive<br>
measurement data and/or messages from the at least one field<br>
device and transmit them to the control center device. In this<br>
way, the central control devices can be operated in a simple<br>
manner by means of a higher-level control center device. In<br>
this case, the control center device may be provided as an<br>
alternative to local operation or in addition to this.<br>
In this context, in accordance with a further advantageous<br>
embodiment of the method according to the invention, provision<br>
is also made for a failure of a central control device to be<br>
indicated by a higher-level control center device and/or<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 7 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
an operating device associated with the failed central control<br>
device. As a result, it is particularly easy to identify merely<br>
from the respective operating device whether a central control<br>
device has failed and therefore to gain access to the other<br>
central control device.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method according to<br>
the invention also provides for the first central control<br>
device and the at least one further central control device to<br>
be connected by means of a data line, and for sign-of-life<br>
signals to be transmitted via this data line. In this way, the<br>
central control devices can check one another for their correct<br>
operation.<br>
In this context, provision may be made for the central control<br>
devices to determine a master central control device which, on<br>
its own, transmits command sequences to the at least one field<br>
device, for the remaining central control devices to identify a<br>
failure of the master central control device from a lack of<br>
signs of life of the master central control device, and, in the<br>
event of failure of the master central control device, to<br>
determine a new master central control device. The<br>
determination of a master central control device is<br>
particularly suitable when command sequences (a plurality of<br>
successive commands) or derived commands (commands or responses<br>
derived from messages from the field devices) occur. Owing to<br>
the mutual monitoring, the central control devices can switch<br>
over automatically from a failed central control device to a<br>
still functional central control device without the operating<br>
personnel of the automation system needing to become involved<br>
in this. As a result of the fact that only sign-of-life signals<br>
need to be exchanged via the data line provided<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 8 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
between the central control devices, no particular requirements<br>
are placed on the data line.<br>
The abovementioned object as regards the automation system is<br>
achieved by an automation system for operating and/or observing<br>
at least one field device having at least two central control<br>
devices, which implement the same automation software, at least<br>
one field device, which is connected to the central control<br>
devices via a data link and receives first and second similar<br>
commands produced by the central control devices, and a command<br>
identification device, which is associated with the field<br>
device and only allows that one of the first and second<br>
commands which is received first to be implemented. Such an<br>
automation system can be provided with particularly little<br>
complexity and therefore cost-effectively owing to the fact<br>
that synchronization of the central devices with one another is<br>
not required.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail with reference<br>
to the exemplary embodiments below. In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic view of a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of an automation system in a block<br>
diagram,<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic view of a second exemplary<br>
embodiment of an automation system in a block<br>
diagram, and<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic view of a field device used in the<br>
automation system shown in figure 2.<br>
The automation system illustrated by way of example in figure 1<br>
comprises a first central control device la and a second<br>
central control device 1b. The central control devices la and<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                          - 9 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
1b are connected to field devices 3a to 3e via a data bus 2,<br>
which is designed to be redundant. The field devices 3a to 3e<br>
are in turn connected to a system to be automated or a process<br>
to be automated in a manner which is not illustrated in figure<br>
1. In this regard, it is assumed by way of example below that<br>
it is an electrical energy supply network which is involved and<br>
that the field devices 3a to 3e represent electrical protection<br>
and control devices.<br>
In order to control the electrical energy supply network (not<br>
illustrated in figure 1) , first commands are produced by the<br>
central control device la and second commands are produced by<br>
the central control device lb. In this case, the designation<br>
"first" and "second" commands is not intended to indicate a<br>
specific sequence in time; they are merely commands which are<br>
generated by the first and the second central control device.<br>
For this purpose, the two central control devices la and lb<br>
implement the same automation software, in this embodiment the<br>
devices not functioning synchronously. The commands are<br>
transmitted to the field devices 3a to 3e via the data bus 2,<br>
which may either be a data bus designed in duplicate or a data<br>
bus having a ring structure. Since the central control devices<br>
la and lb are not in tune with one another and also do not<br>
function synchronously, it may arise that a similar command for<br>
a specific field device, for example the field device 3a, is<br>
produced both by the first central control device la and by the<br>
second central control device lb and is transmitted to the<br>
field device 3a. This field device 3a implements the received<br>
commands. In the case of specific commands, for example closing<br>
of a switch, it is therefore possible to simply implement the<br>
command a second time within a very short period of time, which<br>
would result in an error message of the nature "switch already<br>
closed".<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                         - 10 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
The field devices 3a to 3e are generally also connected to<br>
measured value pickups, such as voltage and/or current<br>
transformers, for example, in the electrical energy supply<br>
network. From these measured value pickups, the field devices<br>
3a to 3e receive measurement signals, which they convert into<br>
measurement data and transmit to the central control devices la<br>
and lb. Messages, such as confirmations of an implemented<br>
action or alarm messages in the event of a specific limit value<br>
being exceeded (for example by a measured current), for<br>
example, are likewise transmitted to the central control<br>
devices la and lb. In this case, all of the measurement data<br>
transmitted from the field devices 3a to 3e to the central<br>
control devices la and lb are transmitted both to the first<br>
central control device la and to the second central control<br>
device lb in order that in each case the same database is<br>
present in both central control devices la and lb and that they<br>
do not need to be matched to one another. Since the central<br>
control devices la and lb operate with the same automation<br>
software, they also respond to the same input messages in the<br>
same way and therefore send back any corresponding similar<br>
commands to the field devices 3a to 3e.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further exemplary embodiment of an automation<br>
system. The automation system shown in figure 2 differs from<br>
that shown in figure 1 substantially by a further function of<br>
the field devices used, which are therefore identified by the<br>
reference symbols 13a to 13e, as a deviation from figure 1.<br>
Since precisely in more complex automation systems a field<br>
device 13a should implement each command only a single time, as<br>
shown in figure 2 it checks, using a command identification<br>
device 4, which is generally part of the device software<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                         - 11 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
of the field device 13a, whether the respectively received<br>
command has already been received previously and in this case<br>
ignores the received command. In other words, the field device<br>
13a only implements those commands which it receives for the<br>
first time. This makes it possible to ensure that the field<br>
device 13a implements each command only once and not a<br>
plurality of times in succession.<br>
In order not to produce any contradictions when implementing<br>
the received first and second commands, the field devices 13a<br>
to 13e, for example whilst implementing a command, can block<br>
the implementation of further received commands. This may be of<br>
high importance, for example, when a command comprising a<br>
plurality of subcommands, i.e. a command sequence, is<br>
implemented by the respective field device and is not intended<br>
to be interrupted by a further command which does not belong to<br>
the command sequence. In addition, the simultaneous<br>
implementation of two contradictory commands is thus prevented.<br>
Once a command has been carried out, provision may also be made<br>
for the field device to prevent the same command from being<br>
carried out for a specific period of time after it was carried<br>
out for the first time before it accepts the same command<br>
another time. This prevents commands which have been sent twice<br>
being carried out.<br>
If in particular also so-called derived commands, i.e. commands<br>
which are attributed to measurement data and messages from the<br>
field devices 13a to 13e, should be capable of being processed<br>
in the automation system, it is possible to connect the central<br>
control devices la and lb to one another by means of a single<br>
data line 5. Via this data line 5, on the<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                         - 12 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
one hand, the central control devices la and lb can determine<br>
their responsibilities. For this purpose, a central control<br>
device, for example the central control device la, is<br>
determined as the so-called master central control device. This<br>
master central control device is hereafter the leading central<br>
control device and is responsible for the abovementioned<br>
derived commands or else for command sequences. However,<br>
provision may also be made for the leading central control<br>
device to take on all of the commands to be transmitted to the<br>
field devices, while the non-leading central control device, in<br>
this case the central control device lb, does not emit any<br>
dedicated commands to the field devices, but moreover carries<br>
out the same actions as the leading central control device la.<br>
On the other hand, so-called sign-of-life signals can also be<br>
transmitted between the central control devices la and lb via<br>
the data line 5. This means that each central control device<br>
emits a signal at regular intervals in order to communicate to<br>
the other central control device that it is still functional.<br>
As an alternative to the sign-of-life signals, provision may<br>
also be made for a central control device la to send an enquiry<br>
to the other central control device lb and wait for a response<br>
to the transmitted enquiry. If this response or the sign-of-<br>
life signal is not present, it is identified that the<br>
corresponding central control device has failed. If the failed<br>
central control device is the master central control device,<br>
another central control device is nominated the master central<br>
control device. In this way, the automation system can continue<br>
to function without any time delay.<br>
In addition, local operating devices 6a and 6b can be connected<br>
to the central control devices la and lb, which local operating<br>
devices 6a and 6b make it possible<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                         - 13 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
to locally operate the corresponding central control device. In<br>
the event of failure of a central control device, this device<br>
indicates the failure to the associated operating device. In<br>
this way, the operating personnel are informed of the failure<br>
and from then on can input all of the instructions using the<br>
further central control device.<br>
The central control devices la and lb can also be connected to<br>
a control center device 7, from where they receive instructions<br>
which they convert into commands for the electrical field<br>
devices 13a to 13e. Likewise, the central control devices la<br>
and lb transmit messages and measurement data from the field<br>
devices 13a to 13e on to the control center device 7. Failure<br>
of a central control device is also indicated in the control<br>
center device 7, so that the operating personnel can change<br>
over to the second central control device.<br>
If the central control devices, via a data line 5 which is<br>
possibly provided, independently identify the failure of a<br>
central control device, switchover of the operation to the<br>
respectively still intact central control device can also take<br>
place automatically and need not be carried out by operating<br>
personnel.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment illustrating how a field<br>
device can be checked to ascertain whether it has already<br>
received a received command before. In this regard, figure 3<br>
shows, by way of example, the field device 13a, which is<br>
connected to the data bus 2 shown in figure 1 via redundant<br>
connecting lines lla and l1b. The field device 13a can be<br>
connected to sensors and actuators in the electrical energy<br>
supply network via a further connecting line 12.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/054828                         - 14 -<br>
2004P16128WOUS<br>
If the electrical field device 13a receives a command from one<br>
of the central control devices la and lb via one of the<br>
connecting lines lla or l1b, this command is compared with<br>
commands in a list of commands 14 by a test unit 18. The list<br>
of commands 14 contains all of those commands which the field<br>
device 13a has already received and implemented before. If the<br>
test unit 18 determines that the received command is already<br>
contained in the list of commands 14, the implementation of<br>
this command is prevented. If, however, the test unit 18<br>
determines that the received command is not present in the list<br>
of commands 14, the command is transmitted to an implementation<br>
unit 15 of the field device 13a and implemented. In addition,<br>
the implemented command is included in the list of commands 14.<br>
The test device 18, the list of commands 14 and the<br>
implementation unit 15 of the field device 13a are generally<br>
realized in device software of the field device 13a.<br>
In order not to prevent a command which has been implemented<br>
once from ever being implemented again, the commands stored in<br>
the list of commands 14, for example, can be deleted again from<br>
the list of commands 14 after a predetermined period of time.<br>
On the other hand, provision may also be made for only the<br>
respective last n commands in the list of commands 14 to be<br>
prevented from being implemented by the test unit 18, where n<br>
may be a predeterminable number of commands. As a result, it is<br>
possible to achieve a situation in which, for example, in each<br>
case the last five commands are intended to be prevented from<br>
being implemented again. This means that those commands which<br>
have been sent to the field device 13a by the two central<br>
control devices la and lb are only implemented once. The<br>
predeterminable period of time or the predetermined number of<br>
commands n is in this case to be selected such that redundant<br>
commands, i.e. commands occurring twice,<br><br>

2004P16128WOUS<br>
are reliably blocked, but desirable implementation of the same<br>
command after a specific time - for example a repeated attempt<br>
to reconnect a circuit breaker - is not prevented.<br>
Although the description of the exemplary embodiments is based<br>
on, by way of example, two central control devices, it is<br>
nevertheless also possible within the context of the invention<br>
to use more than two central control devices. The described<br>
methods of operation also apply analogously to a plurality of<br>
central control devices.<br><br>
