				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
GAS TURBINE BLADE AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a gas turbine blade and a manufacturing method thereof. A gas turbine blade of the present invention is preferable for a turbine blade of an industrial gas turbine. Moreover, although the matter of concern is a weld repaired blade where the weld repair is applied mainly after damage, it can be applied to one where the high temperature and high stress part is previously composed of a weld metal even if it is a new blade.<br>
RELATED ART:<br>
Since the gas turbine blade is exposed to a temperature of 1000°C or more, spalling such as fatigue cracks and oxidation thickness reduction, etc. are created. A blade, which is damaged is abandoned or reused after repair.<br>
A gas turbine blade is a precision casting and three types exist, which are an equiaxed crystal, a unidirectionally solidified crystal, and a single crystal, and the material thereof is a γ phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy. The γ'   phase is an intermetallic compound containing Ni3Al and the γ'  phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy has extremely high high-temperature<br><br>
strength because it has a unique feature where the strength increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, since it has a dendritic structure peculiar to a cast structure, a morphology is obtained in which crystal grain boundaries become complicated even if it is an equiaxed crystal and a unidirectionally solidified crystal, so that the grain boundary strength is high, and crack resistance and fatigue strength are extremely high.<br>
Thus, ay' phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy used for the gas turbine blade has excellent high temperature strength, but it is difficult to weld and to be repaired by welding because ductility at high temperatures and low temperatures is small and workability and weldability are not good.<br>
However, weld repair has become possible by improving the welding technique and by developing a welding material having strength and excellent weldability. The welding material is classified as powder material and wire material. The wire material has good workability and good yield. However, since the wire material is manufactured by hot working and cold drawing, a high strength material having bad workability cannot be used. Since the powder material is manufactured by quenching a sprayed liquid phase, a high strength material having bad workability can be used. However, since the total surface area of the material is large, the amount of gas composition mixed by oxidation or adsorption during the welding process is large<br><br>
compared with the wire material, resulting in sufficient oxidation resistance and fatigue strength being not obtained. Patent documents 1 to 3 disclose weld materials for weld repairing gas turbine blades. As described above, the gas turbine blade material is a y' phase precipitation strengthened type superalloy. However, the ductility at high temperatures and low temperatures is small and workability and weldability are not good, so that a solid solution strengthened type alloy, not a Y' phase precipitation strengthened type alloy, in which a lot of fire resistant elements such as Mo, W, Ta, and Nb are added are used in these well-known examples .  In patent example 2, excellent high temperature strength characteristics are made to coexist with workability and weldability by making the total amount of the fire resistant elements 15 to 28 wt.%. Patent document 1 discloses no total amount of the fire resistant elements but appropriate additions of W, Mo, and Ta are provided, respectively. Moreover, Mo is not added therein and the addition of Ta is increased accordingly. Any of patent documents 1 to 3 disclose that the addition of Al is decreased<br>
in order to decrease precipitation of the y' phase. However, Al is an element, which greatly contributes to the improvement of oxidation resistance of the superalloy and deterioration of oxidation resistance occurs with a decrease in Al, so that Mn and Si are appropriately added to compensate. In order to keep the grain boundaries from nitriding at high temperatures.<br><br>
it has been described that a decrease in Al is necessary.<br>
Since micro-defects such as porosity and blowholes are produced, a HIP treatment is performed in order to eliminate them. A HIP treatment is one which adds an isotropic high pressure at a high temperature and, in the case of a gas turbine blade material, it is typically performed at a temperature from<br>
1160°C to 1200°C where the y'   phase is dissolved. [Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2001-123237 [Patent Document 2] JP-A No. 2001-158929 [Patent Document 3] JP-A No. 2006-291344<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is difficult for the weld material to obtain a strength equal to that of the blade material because of the mixing of gaseous components during the welding process and the difference of alloy components according to importance placed on weldability and workability. Specifically, when the amount of mixed oxygen is great, the oxidation resistance deteriorates considerably. Moreover, there is not only the difference between the gas component and the alloy component but also differences of the solidification structure caused by differences in the solidification rate.<br>
The blade material is slowly solidified in the mold because it is a precision casting but, compared with this, the cooling rate of the weld material during solidification becomes<br><br>
considerably higher. Specifically, C is condensed in the liquid phase during solidification and segregates to the grain boundaries, which are the final parts to solidify, resulting in a high proportion of carbide being formed at the grain boundaries. Carbide precipitated at the grain boundaries pins the grain boundaries and works to prevent the grain boundaries from moving, so that grain boundary migration does not occur by performing the HIP treatment in the blade material where the solidification rate is low and grain boundary segregation is great and the dendritic structure during solidification is<br>
maintained. Not only carbide but also eutectic y' phase and a metal having a high melting point which is segregated to the grain boundaries works for preventing grain boundary migration.<br>
On the other hand, since the weld material has a larger solidification rate, segregation is small and, since the amount of carbide formed at the grain boundaries is small, the grain boundaries are easily moved by the HIP treatment and the dendritic structure is aligned. Accordingly, the grain boundary strength is decreased, resulting in high temperature durability, fatigue strength, and the crack resistance being decreased.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide a welded part having better fatigue properties and crack resistance than that of the prior art by suppressing grain boundary alignment of the weld metal in a turbine blade where<br><br>
the weld repaired part or the high temperature high stress part is composed of a weld metal.<br>
The present invention provides a gas turbine blade where<br>
a part of the blade base material composed of a y' phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy includes a weld metal, in which the weld metal comprises a Ni-based alloy containing Ta from 4.8 to 5.3 wt.%, Cr from 18 to 23 wt.%, Co from 12 to 17 wt.%, W from 14 to 18 wt.%, C from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%. Mo from 1 to 2 wt.%, and Al of 1 wt.% or less and in which the oxygen content is 0 to 30 ppm, the Ti content 0 to 0.1 wt.%, and the Re content 0 to 0.5 wt.%.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a gas turbine blade where a part of the blade base material composed of a γ' phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy is composed of a solid solution strengthened type Ni-based alloy, in which the weld metal comprises a Ni-based alloy containing Ta from 4.8 to 5.3 wt.%, Cr from 18 to 23 wt%, Co from 12 to 17 wt%, W from 14 to 18 wt%, C from 0.03 to 0.1 wt%.

Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a gas turbine blade where a part of the blade<br>
base material composed ofay' phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy is composed of a weld metal, in which a step of stripping the blade base material, a step of applying<br>

chamber using a TIG method which uses a welding wire composed of a Ni-base material containing Ta from 4.8 to 5.3 wt.%, Cr from 18 to 23 wt%, Co from 12 to 17 wt%, W from 14 to 18 wt.%, C from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%, Mo from 1 to 2 wt.% and Al of 1 wt% or less, where the oxygen content is 0 to 30 ppm, the Ti content 0 to 0.1 wt.%, the Re content 0 to 0.5 wt. %, a step of applying a HIP treatment in which a HIP treatment is performed at a temperature from 1100 to 1150°C after the welding step, and a step of applying an aging treatment in which an aging treatment<br>
is performed at a temperature from 835 to 855°C after the step thereafter are included.<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a gas turbine blade where a part<br>
of the blade base material composed ofa γ' phase precipitation strengthened type Ni-based superalloy is composed of a weld metal, in which a step of welding to form the part composed of the weld metal by welding in an inert gas chamber using a TIG method which uses a welding wire composed of a Ni-base material containing Ta from 4.8 to 5.3 wt.%, Cr from 18 to 23 wt%, Co from 12 to 17 wt%, W from 14 to 18 wt.%, C from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%. Mo from 1 to 2 wt. % and Al of 1 wt% or less, where the oxygen content is 0 to 30 ppm, the Ti content 0 to 0.1 wt.%, the Re content 0 to 0.5 wt.%, a step of applying a HIP treatment in which a HIP treatment is performed at a temperature from 1100 to 1150°C after the welding step, and a step of applying<br><br>
an aging treatment in which an aging treatment is performed at a temperature from 835 to 855°C after the step thereafter are included.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a welding wire for the weld metal of a gas turbine blade of the present invention and in a method for manufacturing the gas turbine blade of the present invention may contain Al from 0.25 to 1 wt. % , Si from 0.15 to 0.35 wt.%, and Mn from 0 . 4 to 2 wt. % . As a result, the oxidation resistance of the welded part can be improved.<br>
In an example of a gas turbine blade of the present invention, the weld repaired part is formed of a weld metal. Moreover, in another example, the part exposed to high temperatures and high stresses includes the aforementioned weld metal in a new turbine blade.<br>
In a method for manufacturing a gas turbine blade of the present invention, the solution heat treatment is performed at a temperature not lower than the solid-solution temperature<br>
of the y' phase and not higher than the partial melting temperature.<br>
Moreover, in a method for manufacturing a gas turbine blade of the present invention, it is preferable that a coating film formed over the surface of the gas turbine blade be peeled off before welding.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, a gas<br><br>
turbine blade can be obtained where alignment of the grain boundaries is suppressed and which has a welded part having excellent fatigue strength and oxidation resistance characteristics.<br>
Fig. 1 is a figure where the liquid phase concentration during equilibrium solidification of the chemical components of a weld material, described in patent document 1 is calculated by using a CALPHAD method and the calculated values are plotted. Since Mo and W preferentially come into the solid phase as solidification proceeds, that is, increasing the solid phase fraction, the concentration in the liquid layer decreases. As a result, Mo and W hardly segregate to the grain boundaries. On the other hand, since Ta is concentrated in the liquid layer as solidification proceeds, it is an element which is segregated to the grain boundaries and is effective in suppressing alignment of the grain boundaries.<br>
Although patent document 2 provides the sum total of the heat resistant elements. Mo and W have a totally different segregation behavior from Ta, so that each addition has to be provided independently.<br>
In order to suppress alignment of the grain boundaries, it is necessary to add Ta of 4.8 wt.% or more. However, when the addition exceeds 5.3 wt.%, workability becomes worse and making wire becomes difficult.<br>
Mo and W are important for increasing the strength, and<br><br>
it is necessary to add Mo from 1 to 2 wt.% and W from 14 to 16 wt.%. Although any element contributes to improvement in the intracrystalline strength, a harmful phase is produced when too much is added, resulting in the ductility thereof being decreased.<br>
From the viewpoint of suppressing grain nitride cracking<br>
and suppressing precipitation of the y' phase, the addition of Al is necessary to be 1 wt/% or less, specifically, it is preferable to be 0.75 wt.% or less. In order to maintain the oxidation resistance, it is preferable that Si from 0.15 to 0.35 wt.%, Mn from 0.4 wt% to 2 wt.%, and Cr from 18 to 23 wt.% are added in addition to Al of 0.35 wt.% or more, and that the oxygen content after welding be made small as much as possible, preferably, 0 to 30 ppm. Si, Mn, and Cr increase the oxidation resistance but they make the material brittle when they are added in excess.<br>
Although it is necessary to add Co of 12 wt.% or more in order to expand the solid solubility limit of Cr, it is necessary to make it 17 wt. % or less because the material becomes brittle because a specific harmful phase is produced when they are added in excess.<br>
It is preferable that the content of Ti be made smaller tobe O too . lwt. % because the weldmaterial is not aprecipitation strengthened type.<br>
The Re content is preferably controlled to be 0 to 0.5<br><br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows the temperature dependences of the strength of a solid solution strengthened type alloy and a γ' phase precipitation strengthened type alloy. Although the γ' phase precipitation strengthened type has high strength up to the temperatures where the γ' phase is soluble, the strength thereof rapidly decreases at temperatures higher than this. In order to eliminate defects, it is necessary to perform a HIP treatment at a temperature where the strength becomes smaller. IN738 and Rene80 which are widely used as a gas turbine blade have a y' solution temperature of about 1160°C, so that the HIP treatment is generally performed at 1160°C or more.<br>
The solid solution strengthened type alloy has a small temperature dependence of the strength as shown in Fig. 2 and the strength thereof is smaller than that of a y' phase precipitation strengthened type alloy at about 1100°C. However, if it is exposed to high temperatures, the strength does not decrease as much. On the other hand, the alignment of the grain boundaries is accelerated with temperature, so that it is<br>
necessary to make the HIP temperature 1150°C or less in order to suppress the alignment of the grain boundaries of the solid solution strengthened type alloy.  If it becomes lower than<br>
1100°C, the defect is hardly crushed. If the welding condition is optimized, weld cracks do not occur and the defects are blowholes and micro-porosities. Since these defects are<br><br>
produced in the weld metal which is a solid solution strengthened type alloy, the HIP temperature should be 1150°C or less and 1100CC or more. A HIP treatment not lower than the solid solution temperature of the y' phase has the effect where a grown or flattened y' phase is dissolved again and reprecipitated to recover the damage of the base material.<br>
When the HIP temperature is controlled to be 1150°C or less and 1100°C or more, the y' phase is not dissolved again and there is no damage recovery effect of the base material. Therefore, in the present invention, it is preferable that a<br>
solution heat treatment of the y' phase be performed before weld repair. However, if the damage of the base material is small, the solution heat treatment can be omitted.<br>
If a HIP treatment is performed, an aging treatment is performed for mainly improving the strength of the base material. The aging treatment temperature is preferably 835°C to 855°C which is suitable for controlling the grain size and morphology of the precipitate.<br>
According to the selection of the weld metal element and the manufacturing method thereof as mentioned above, the alignment of the grain boundaries is improved, resulting in the fatigue strength being widely improved.<br>
Fig. 7 is an example of a weld repaired blade. It is one where the oxidation reduced thickness part 101 where a reduced thickness produced by oxidation is repaired by using<br><br>
the weld repaired part 102 of the present invention. [Embodiment 1]<br>
An alloy having the chemical composition as shown in table 1 was manufactured by using a vacuum melting technique and processed to a wire of about 2mm by hot forging and cold drawing. Using this, the weld metal is formed over the blade base material by a TIG welding method and a test piece is taken to perform various evaluations.<br>
