This invention relates to a device for minimising the shock<br>
of collision between a motor vehicle and another<br>
object The said object can be   a  moving object such as another<br>
motor vehicle; or can be a stationary object such a<br>
wall or other stmcture.<br>
It is known that a well designed automobile is built with strategically located crumple zones that are incorporated within the structure of the vehicle to lessen the impact encountered during a collision. This is done with the objective of protecting the passenger envelope in the event of a crash.<br>
This invention has a similar objective in view, but proposes a device of a simple, novel and effective constmction.<br>
The device for minimising the shock of collision between a motor vehicle and another object, according to this<br><br>
invention, comprises a shock absorber assembly disposed between the bumper and the body of the vehicle; means for firmly mounting the assembly with respect to the chassis of the vehicle, the assembly being attached by at least one crumple-member to the chassis, whereby on a collision taking place between the vehicle and the object, with the forces of collision acting on the bumper, a substantial portion of the shock of the collision is taken up by the assembly and the crumple-member.<br>
The motor vehicle discussed herein is a four wheeler motor vehicle, such as, a motor car, although other types of vehicles, to which this invention is applicable, are also included in this specification and the Claims.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the device proposed herein.<br><br>
Fig.l illustrating a part of the front portion of a car with one coiled spring shock absorber A and crumple-member C visible.<br>
Fig.2 illustrating a part view of the front portion of a car with an array of coiled spring shock absorbers A<br>
Fig.3 illustrating another part view of the front portion of a car with an array of coiled spring shock absorbers A, interconnecting members 1, stays S and crumple-members C.<br>
And<br>
Fig.4 illustrating a part of the rear portion of the car with one coiled spring shock absorber A and crumple-member C visible.<br>
A shock absorber assembly, comprising coiled spring shock absorbers   A,   is disposed between the bumper and<br><br>
the body B of the vehicle.. By the "bumper" of the vehicle is meant either the front bumper F1 or the rear bumper F2 or both.<br>
Means for firmly mounting the assembly with respect to the chassis D of the vehicle are provided, the assembly being attached by the crumple-members C to the chassis D. Such means are exemplified in the embodiment illustrated by a framework G of intermediate members I firmly fixed to the shock absorbers on either side of the assembly, the framework being fixed to stays S attached to the chassis D so as to keep the assembly in position to receive the impact of collision between the vehicle and the object, such as, a moving or stationary object.. The aforementioned provision also enables the shock absorbers to share, that is, distribute among themselves, the forces of collision. With the forces of collision acting on the bumper, a substantial portion of the shock of the collision is<br><br>
taken   up   by  the     assembly   and   the   crumple-members.<br>
The expression "shock absorber assembly" includes an assembly of spring (such as coiled spring or belleville spring shock absorbers (as illustrated), hydraulic shock absorbers or gas operated shock absorbers, among others, or any combination of these.<br>
During impact, the shock of the collision is not only borne by the shock absorbers but also by the crumple-members which, as their name suggests, crumple under collision forces, thus participating in shock absorption.<br>
What has been stated above with regard to the front bumpet portion of the vehicle is applicable to the rear bumper portion of the vehicle.<br>
The terms and  expressions  in  this  specification  are of description, not of limitation, since various other<br><br>
embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1. A device for minimising the shock of collision between a motor vehicle and another object, comprising a shock absorber assembly disposed between the bumper and the body of the vehicle; means for firmly mounting the assembly with respect to the chassis of the vehicle, the assembly being attached by at least one crumple-member to the chassis, whereby on a collision taking place between the vehicle and the object, with the forces of collision acting on the bumper, a substantial portion of the shock of the collision is taken up by the assembly and the crumple-member.<br>
2. A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the shock absorber assembly is a spring shock absorber assembly, such as, a coiled spring or belleville spring shock absorber assembly.<br><br>
3. A device as claimed in Claim Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the shock absorber assembly is a hydraulic shock absorber assembly.<br>
4. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the shock absorber assembly is a gas filled shock absorber assembly.<br>
5. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Qaims wherein the shock absorber assembly is disposed between the bumper and the body of the vehicle.<br>
6. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the bumper is the front bumper of the vehicle.<br>
7. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the bumper is the rear bumper of the vehicle.<br><br>
8.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims<br>
wherein the means for firmly mounting the assembly with respect to the chassis of the vehicle comprise a framework of intermediate members firmly fixed to the shock absorbers on either side of the assembly, the framework being fixed to stays attached to the chassis so as to keep the assembly in position to receive the impact of collision between the vehicle and the object and also enable the shock absorbers to share, or distribute among themselves, the forces of collision.<br>
9.	A device for minimising the shock of collision between<br>
a motor vehicle and another object substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings. Dated this the 10th day of  Febmary     2000<br><br></td>
