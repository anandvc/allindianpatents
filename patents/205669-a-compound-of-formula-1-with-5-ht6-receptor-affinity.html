This invention relates to new indole derivatives with 5-HT6 receptor affinity, and associated pharmaceutical compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor famines termed 5-HTl, 5-HT2, 5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7, Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nervous system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. ( See for ex. B.L. Roth et ah, J- Pharmacol Exp. Ther.-, 1994, 268, pages 1403-14120 , D. R. Sibley et al, Mol Pharmacol, 1993,43, 320-327 , A.J. Sleight et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5 , and A. J. Sleight et al.

"Solvates" means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H2O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
"Prodrug" or "pro-drug" means a pharmacologically inactive form of a compound which must be metabolized in vivo, e.g., by biological fluids or enzymes, by a subject after administration into a pharmacologically active form of the compound in order to produce the desired pharmacological effect. Prodrugs of a compound of Formula I are prepared by modifying one or more functional group(s) present in the compound of Formula I in such a way that the modification(s) may be cleaved in vivo to release the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of Formula I wherein a hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group in a compound of Formula I is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g. acetate, dialkylaminoacetates, formates, phosphates, sulfates and benzoate derivatives) and carbamates of hydroxy functional groups ( e.g. N,N-dimethylcarbonyl), esters of carboxyl functional groups (e.g. ethyl esters, morpholinoethanol esters), N-acyl derivatives {e.g, N-acetyl), N-Mannich bases, Schiffbases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals, and enol esters of ketones and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like.<br>
The prodrug can be metabolized before absorption, during absorption, after absorption, or at a specific site. Although metabolism occurs for many compounds<br><br>
primarily in the liver, almost all other tissues and organs, especially the lung, are able to carry out varying degrees of metabolism. Prodrug forms of compounds may be utilized, for example, to improve bioavailability, improve subject acceptability such as by masking or reducing unpleasant characteristics such as bitter taste or gastrointestinal irritability, alter solubility such as for intravenous use, provide for prolonged or sustained release or delivery, improve ease of formulation, or provide site-specific delivery of the compound. Reference to a compound herein includes prodrug forms of a compound. Prodrugs are described in The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, by Richard B. Silverman, Academic Press, San Diego, 1992. Chapter 8: "Prodrugs and Drug delivery Systems" pp.352-401; Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1985; Design of Biopharmaceutical Properties through Prodrugs and Analogs:, Ed. by E, B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, 1977; and Drug Delivery Systems^ ed. by R.L. Juliano, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 1980.<br>
"Subject" means mammals and non-mammals. Mammals means any member of the Mammalia class including, but not limited to, humans; non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice, and guinea pigs; and the like. Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, and the like. The term "subject" does not denote a particular age or sex.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease state, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease state. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, disease state being treated, the severity or the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgement of the attending medical or veterinary practitioner, and other factors.<br>
"Disease state" means any disease, condition, symptom, or indication.<br>

Compounds of the present invention may be made by the methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references<br><br>
such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistr}' of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of th.e present invention may be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes may be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes may be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials may be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably take place at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range firom about -78°C to about 150° C, more preferably from about 0°Cto about 125°C, and most preferably and conveniendy at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20°C.<br>
Scheme A Scheme A describes methods of preparing piperazinyl indoles.<br><br><br>
Ortho-nitrotoluenes substituted with a protected piperazinyl group on the phenyl ring can be converted to 2-unsubstituted indoles (4a, R2 and R3 = H, P is a protecting group) via the Leimgruber-Batcho synthesis as described in Organic Synthesis Collective Volume 7, page 34 and in Heterocycles, 22, 195 (1984). The ortho-nitrotoluene (2) is, condensed with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl or diethyl acetal, tert-butoxy-bis(dimethylamino)methane, and the like in a suitable solvent such as DMF, optionally in the presence of an added amine such as pyrrolidine to afford the dialkylaminonitrostyrene (3). Reduction of the nitrostyrene to the indole (4a, R2 and R3 = H) can be affected by a variety of methods such as catalytic hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, or by chemical reducing agents such as titanium trichloride, iron or zinc metal.<br>
1-Protected 4-piperazinyl nitrotoluene precursors for the Batcho-Leimgruber indole synthesis can be prepared by nucleophilic displacement of a nitrobenzene with a leaving group such as a halo or trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy with a suitably 1-protected piperazine of general formula a, wherein P is a protecting group, as described in Synthesis, 1145 (1990) for displacement of 2-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy nitrobenzene with 1-benzylpiperazine. Other suitable protecting groups include N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), carbobenzyloxy (Cbz), carbethoxy, acetyl, benzoyl, and formyl groups.<br>
Alternatively, piperazine can be used in the displacement as described in /. Med. Chem.y 42, 4794 (1999) for the preparation of l-(2-nitrophenyl)piperazine and the resulting nitrophenyl piperazine can be protected by conventional methods such as by treatment with di-tert-butyldicarbonate to afford the Boc derivative.<br><br>
Piperazinylindoles or piperidinylindoles can also be prepared by the Bartoli indole synthesis which is described in Tetrahedron Letters, 30, 2129 (1989). A suitably protected 2-piperazinyl or 2-piperidinyl nitrobenzene is treated with a vinyl Grignard reagent in THF<br><br>
to afford the indole (4b) in a single step,    2-Alkyl substituted indoles, which are not available via the Leimgruber-Batcho synthesis, can be prepared by this route.<br>
Piperazinylindoles can also be prepared from the corresponding aminoindole by reaction of the amino group with bis-chloroethylamine or a suitably protected derivative thereof as is well known in the art. For example, preparation of 7-(l-piperazinyI)indole by treatment of 7-aminoindole with bis-chloroethylamine is described in WO 94/15919.<br>
Piperazinyhndoles can also be prepared from ortho-nitrophenylacetonitriles as described for the preparation of 7-(4-carbethoxypipera2in-l-yl)indole in UK Patent Application GB 2097790.<br>
Piperazinylindoles can also be prepared from the corresponding bromoindole by Palladium-catalyzed coupling with a suitably protected piperazine, such as Boc-piperazine (Buchwald reaction).<br>
Piperdinylindoles can be prepared by conversion of a suitably protected haloindoie to the lithio derivative, followed by condensation with a suitably protected 4-piperidone, and subsequent dehydration and reduction of the olefin.<br><br>
Scheme B<br>
Scheme B describes methods of preparing compounds of Formula I wherein R1 R2, R3 R4, R5,R6,R7,R8,R9,R10   , and A are as defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br><br>
3-Aryl- or 3-heteroaryl sulfanyl indoles of general Formula (5), wherein P is a protecting group and W is -CH- or N, are prepared by reaction of the indole sodium salt with an aryl or a heteroaryl disulfide as described in Synthesis 480 (1988). Aryl or heteroaryl disulfides are commercially available or can be easily prepared by oxidation of the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl thiol by means well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Removal of the protecting group (P) from the piperazine or piperidine of general Formula (5) under standard conditions can afford compounds of Formula (12).<br><br>
Oxidation of the aryl or heteroaryl sulfanyl group to the aryl or heteroaryl sulfonyl group can be accomplished with a suitable oxidizing agent such as potassium peroxymonosulfate (Oxone ), 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and the like. It will be appreciated that with some of these oxidizing agents oxidation of the piperazinyl nitrogen may also occur to give the N-oxide. In these cases, reduction of the N-oxide back to the parent piperazine of general Formula (6) can be effected with a suitable reducing agent such as hydrogen (catalytic hydrogenation), triphenylphosphine and the like.<br>
Removal of the protecting group (P) from the piperazine or piperidine of general Formula (6) is accomplished under standard conditions, e.g., cleavage of the Boc group by treatment with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such as water, ethanol or ethyl acetate ,to afford compounds of general Formula (7).<br>
1-Substituted derivatives of general Formula (8), wherein Alk is an alkyl group, are prepared by alkylation of the sodium salt of the parent indole of general Formula (6) with a suitable alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide or sulfonate in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or DMF, to afford compounds of general Formula (9).<br>
Coupling of compounds of general Formula (7) or (9) with a carboxyaldehyde under reductive amination conditions can afford compounds (10) or (11) respectively, wherein R8 is C1-10-alkyl group.<br><br>
Scheme C<br>
Scheme C describes an alternative method of preparing a compound of Formula I wherein R1 is -SO2-A , and R8 is C1-10-alkyl R2, R3 R4 R5 R6 are hydrogen and A is as defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br><br>
Nitrobenzenes of formula 14 can be prepared from nitrobenzenes of formula 13, with a halomethane derivative such as halomethanesulfonyl benzene, halomethanesulfinyl benzene or halomethanesulfanyl benzene in the presence of a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium hydroxyde, lithium hydroxyde, or sodiummethoxide, in a suitable solvent such as THF. Nucleophilic displacement of the nitrobenzene of formula 14 with a leaving group L, such as a halo group, with a 1-alkylpiperazine can afford a nitrobenzene compound of formula 15. Reduction of the nitro group by a variety of methods well known in the art, such as catalytic hydrogenation, preferably in the presence of Pearlman's catalyst (Palladium hydroxyde) in a suitable solvent such as THF can afford an amine of formula 16. Addition of an ortho ester of general formula R'2C(OR)3 wherein R is an alkyl group and R  is hydrogen or alkyl, in the presence of an acid such p-toluenesulfonic acid, followed by cyclization can afford an indole of formula 18, wherein R2 is hydrogen or alkyl.<br><br>

Trifluoroacetic acid (5 mL) was added to a solution of 4-(3-phenyIsulfanyI-lH-indol-7-yl)piperazine-l-carboxylic acid tert-'butyl ester (700 mg, 1.7 mmol), prepared as described in Example 1 Step 1, in 4 mL of dichloromethane. After 15 min the solution was diluted with water, basified with ammonium hydroxide, and extracted with dichloromethane. The dichloromethane was washed with brine and evaporated to afford 3-phenylsulfanyl-7-piperazin-l-yl-lH-indole (701) as a solid. The hydrochloride salt<br>
crystallized from ethanol-HCl to afford 500 mg of white solid, m.p. 300 °C. Similarly replacing 4-(3-phenylsulfanyl-lH-indol-7-yl)piperazine-l-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester with the appropriate sulfanyl derivatives, prepared as described in other examples herein,<br><br>
the following compounds were prepared:<br>
3-(2,3-dichloro-phenylsulfanyI)-5-piperazin-l-yl-lH-indole (702), mp 255.1-255.5 °C;3-phenylsulfanyl-5-piperazin-l-yl-lH-indole (703), mp. 246-247 , and 3-(2,6-dichloro-phenyl5Lilfanyl)-5-piperazm-l-yl-lH-indoIe(704)M+H=378.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Composition for Oral Administration<br><br>
The ingredients are mixed and dispensed into capsules containing about 100 mg each; one capsule would approximate a total daily dosage.<br><br>
The ingredients are combined and granulated using a solvent such as methanol. The formulation is then dried and formed into tablets (containing about 20 mg of active compound) with an appropriate tablet machine.<br><br><br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in a portion of the water for injection. A sufficient quantity of sodium chloride is then added with stirring to make the solution isotonic. The solution is made up to weight with the remainder of the water for injection, filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane filter and packaged under sterile conditions.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 12 Suppository Formulation<br><br>
The ingredients are melted together and mixed on a steam bath, and poured into molds containing 2.5 g total weight.<br><br>
All of the ingredients, except water, are combined and heated to about 60°C with stirring. A sufficient quantity of water at about 60°C is then added with vigorous stirring to emulsify the ingredients, and water then added q.s. about 100 g.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 14 Nasal Spray Formulations<br>
Several aqueous suspensions containing from about 0.025-0.5 percent active compound are prepared as nasal spray formulations. The formulations optionally contain inactive ingredients such as, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, dextrose, and the like. Hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH. The nasal spray formulations may be delivered via a nasal spray metered pump typically delivering about 50-100 microliters of formulation per actuation. A typical dosing schedule is 2-4 sprays every 4-12 hours,<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Radioligand binding studies<br>
The binding activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows.<br>
Duplicate determinations of ligand affinity are made by competing for binding of [3H]LSD in cell membranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
All determinations are made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 20mM MgS04, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic acid, pH 7.4 at 37°C, in a 250 microhter reaction volume. Assay tubes containing [3H] LSD (5nM), competing ligand, and membrane are incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 min. at 37°C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PEI) using a Packard 96 well cell harvester and washed 3 times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl. Bound [3H] LSD is determined as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCount.<br>
Displacement of [3H]LSD from the binding sites was quantified by fitting concentration-binding data to a 4-parameter logistic equation:<br><br>
where Hill is the Hill slope, [ligand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and IC50 is the concentration of radioligand producing half-maximal specific binding of<br><br>
radioligand. The specific binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 15, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists.<br>
