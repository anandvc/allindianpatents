				<td>SECURING SAFETY-CRITICAL VARIABLES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/035,901, filed on March 12, 2008. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to securing safety-critical<br>
variables, and more particularly to securing safety-critical variables in memory of<br>
a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1A, a functional block diagram of a<br>
processor system according to the prior art is presented. A processor 100<br>
executes instructions and reads and stores data. The data may be stored in a<br>
memory 104. In various implementations, the processor 100 may execute<br><br>
instructions from the memory 104 or from another memory (not shown), which<br>
may include flash memory or read only memory.<br>
[0005] When the processor 100 writes safety-critical variables to the<br>
memory 104, the processor 100 uses a dual store module 108. Safety-critical<br>
variables may include throttle position, for example. If the stored value of the<br>
desired throttle position is erroneously increased, an increase in torque that the<br>
driver was not expecting may occur. The dual store module 108 therefore stores<br>
two copies of safety-critical variables from the processor 100 into the<br>
memory 104. These copies can be compared to detect inadvertent changes to<br>
one or the other of the copies.<br>
[0006] A direct memory access (DMA) module 112 communicates with<br>
the memory 104. In various implementations, the DMA module 112 may be<br>
located on the bus between the dual store module 108 and the memory 104.<br>
The DMA module 112 transfers data to and from the memory 104 on behalf of<br>
peripherals 116. The DMA module 112 allows for memory transfers without<br>
burdening the processor 100.<br>
[0007] Referring now to FIG. 1B, a functional block diagram of the<br>
memory 104 is shown. The dual store module 108 may store copies of the<br>
safety-critical variables into two memory blocks. For example, a first variable<br>
may be stored at 120-1 and at 120-2. This dual storage may also be performed<br>
for variable 2, variable 3, and so on.<br>
[0008] When the processor 100 requests a read of one of the safety-<br>
critical variables, the dual store module 108 compares the two values read from<br><br>
the memory 104. A difference between the two values will signal an error<br>
condition. For example, a discrepancy between values of a desired throttle<br>
position may cause the processor 100 to choose the lower of the two throttle<br>
positions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] A system comprises a general-purpose memory, a lockable<br>
memory, a memory management unit, and a processor. The general-purpose<br>
memory includes data for a first set of addresses. The lockable memory includes<br>
data for a second set of addresses. The memory management unit selectively<br>
writes data to one of the general-purpose memory and the lockable memory and<br>
selectively locks the lockable memory by preventing writes to the lockable<br>
memory. The processor instructs the memory management unit to unlock the<br>
lockable memory before requesting a write to one of the second set of<br>
addresses.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br><br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0019] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 2A, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary processor system according to the principles of the present disclosure<br>
is presented. A processor 200 stores data within a lockable memory 202 and a<br>
general-purpose memory 204 of a memory module 206. The lockable and<br>
general-purpose memories 202 and 204 are accessed by a memory<br>
management unit (MMU) 208. Access may be prevented to addresses within the<br>
lockable memory 202 until a special event occurs, such as an unlock command<br>
being received by the MMU 208.<br>
[0021] In various implementations, the lockable and general-purpose<br>
memories 202 and 204 may be implemented as a single common memory. The<br>
MMU 208 may define a section (such as a range of addresses) of the common<br>
memory to serve as the lockable memory 202. The remainder of the common<br>
memory may then serve as the general-purpose memory 204.<br>
[0022] A direct memory access (DMA) module 212 communicates with<br>
the lockable and general-purpose memories 202 and 204. The DMA module 212<br>
allows data transfer to and from peripherals 214 without requiring operation of<br><br>
the processor 200. Because the DMA module 212 interacts directly with the<br>
lockable and general-purpose memories 202 and 204, the lockable memory 202<br>
may not be protected from writes by the DMA module 212.<br>
[0023] To mitigate this vulnerability, a DMA diagnostic module 220 can<br>
be actuated by the processor 200. The DMA diagnostic module 220 verifies<br>
correct operation of the DMA module 212. For example, the DMA diagnostic<br>
module 220 may instruct the DMA module 212 to write data into the lockable<br>
memory 202 and/or the general-purpose memory 204 at a specific location. That<br>
specific location can then be read by the processor 200 to verify that the DMA<br>
module 212 is writing to the correct addresses. For example, operation of the<br>
DMA diagnostic module 220 may be initiated upon power-up, at periodic<br>
intervals, or at any other time specified by the processor 200.<br>
[0024] Data written to the lockable and general-purpose memories 202<br>
and 204 by the processor 200 may be protected by an error-correcting code<br>
(ECC) module 230. The ECC module 230 may add an ECC code, such as a<br>
checksum or parity bit, to data received from the processor 200. In addition, the<br>
ECC module 230 may encode data from the processor 200 using an ECC<br>
process, such as Reed-Solomon encoding. When data is read back, the ECC<br>
module 230 can check that no errors have been introduced, and possibly correct<br>
some or all of the detected errors.<br>
[0025] The ECC module 230 may operate on all values written by the<br>
processor 200 or on selected values, such as safety-critical variables.<br>
Checksums or other values determined by the ECC module 230 may be written<br><br>
into the lockable memory 202, where they will be protected by the MMU 208, or<br>
into the general-purpose memory 204. By writing them into the general-purpose<br>
memory, the lockable memory 202 can be re-locked as the checksum is still<br>
being calculated. This minimized the length of time that the lockable memory<br>
202 remains unlocked.<br>
[0026] Variables, such as safety-critical variables, may also be<br>
protected by a transposing dual store module 240. The transposing dual store<br>
module 240 may write two copies of each variable to the lockable memory 202<br>
and/or the general-purpose memory 204. For example only, the transposing dual<br>
store module 240 may write one copy of the variable to the lockable memory 202<br>
and the other copy to the general-purpose memory 204.<br>
[0027] Writing to the lockable memory 202 may first require an unlock<br>
command to be sent to the MMU 208. Interrupts may be disabled while the<br>
lockable memory 202 is unlocked to prevent other routines from accessing the<br>
lockable memory 202 while unlocked.<br>
[0028] The transposing dual store module 240 may write one copy of a<br>
variable to the beginning of one memory block, and write another copy of that<br>
same variable to the end of another memory block. For example only, the copies<br>
of the variable may be identical or may be variants of each other. For example<br>
only, the two copies may be ones' or two's complements of each other. These<br>
copies may be referred to as dual values, or duals, of each other.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 2B, an exemplary layout of the lockable<br>
memory 202 is shown. The data value written for the first variable may be written<br><br>
to the location 250-1, while the dual of that value may be written to the location<br>
250-2. For example, the dual may be the ones' complement or the two's<br>
complement. Variable 2 may be written to the location 250-3, adjacent to<br>
variable 1, while the dual of variable 2 may be written to the location 250-4,<br>
adjacent to the dual of variable 1.<br>
[0030] During a read, the transposing dual store module 240 verifies<br>
that the stored value and its stored dual are equivalent. If they are not, the<br>
processor 200 may take remedial action. Remedial action may also be taken<br>
when the ECC module 230 identifies an error, even if that error has been<br>
corrected by the ECC module 230.<br>
[0031] For example, remedial action may include using a default value<br>
for the variable that appears to have been corrupted. In addition, remedial action<br>
may include setting an engine code or trouble code and illuminating a<br>
malfunction indicator light, such as a check engine light. Remedial action may<br>
also include attempting to recalculate the variable.<br>
[0032] More restrictive remedial actions may include powering down<br>
the engine or disabling throttle control, which may allow a throttle valve to return<br>
to a default position, such as a high idle position. Remedial action may also<br>
include setting the throttle valve to a predetermined idle position that is less than<br>
high idle. Remedial action may also include setting a maximum limit for the<br>
opening of the throttle valve. Remedial action may also include limiting<br>
acceleration and/or power produced by the engine, such as by limiting torque<br><br>
requests to a maximum value. If an error persists or recurs, the processor 100<br>
may escalate from less severe to more severe remedial action.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIGs. 3A-3B, functional block diagrams of<br>
further exemplary processor systems according to the principles of the disclosure<br>
are presented. In FIG. 3A, the MMU 208 is absent and therefore lockable<br>
memory has not been defined within a memory module 300. Safety-critical<br>
variables are still protected within a general-purpose memory 302 by the ECC<br>
module 230 and the transposing dual store module 240. In addition, operation of<br>
the DMA module 212 is validated by employing the DMA diagnostic module 220.<br>
[0034] In FIG. 3B, a memory management unit (MMU) 304 is located<br>
between the lockable and general-purpose memories 202 and 204 and the DMA<br>
module 212. The MMU 304 may then protect the lockable memory 202 from<br>
erroneous writes by the DMA module 212. In various implementations,<br>
attempted writes to the lockable memory 202 from the DMA module 212 may be<br>
disabled entirely by the MMU 304. Alternatively, writes to the lockable memory<br>
202 may be allowed when the lockable memory 202 is unlocked.<br>
[0035] Alternatively, the MMU 304 may require an unlock command<br>
from the DMA module 212 before allowing writes to the lockable memory 202. In<br>
various implementations, a reserved address may be used as a signal to the<br>
MMU 304 that a legitimate write to the lockable memory 202 is desired. For<br>
example, one of the peripherals 214 that has a legitimate need to write to the<br>
lockable memory 202 may first perform a dummy access to the reserved<br><br>
address. The MMU 304 may then allow the subsequent write to the lockable<br>
memory 202.<br>
[0036] Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart depicts exemplary<br>
operation of a processor system such as that shown in FIG. 2A. Control begins<br>
in step 402, where a lockable area of memory is locked. In various<br>
implementations, the lockable area of the memory may be locked by default.<br>
Control continues in step 404, where DMA diagnostics are performed.<br>
[0037] The DMA diagnostics may be performed once per key cycle.<br>
For example, DMA diagnostics may be performed by commanding a DMA<br>
transfer of a known value to a predetermined location of the memory. The<br>
predetermined location may be within the lockable area or a general-purpose<br>
area of the memory. Alternatively, transfers may be initiated to both the lockable<br>
and general-purpose portions.<br>
[0038] The predetermined location can then be read and compared to<br>
the known value to verify the integrity of the DMA process. A fault during the<br>
DMA transfer or an error in the comparison of the read value with the known<br>
value may result in a trouble code being set, such as a P0606 code. After the<br>
trouble code is set, further remedial action may be performed.<br>
[0039] Control continues in step 406, where control determines<br>
whether a write has been requested to the lockable area without the appropriate<br>
authority. If so, control transfers to step 408; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
410. The appropriate authority may be determined by whether the write was<br><br>
initiated by a standard write routine or by a lockable write routine. The standard<br>
write routine would not have the authority to modify lockable memory.<br>
[0040] In step 408, the target address of the write may be recorded for<br>
diagnostic purposes. Because the write was not authorized, no data is written to<br>
the target address. Control continues in step 412, where a counter is<br>
incremented. The counter may be reset to zero upon engine start-up. Control<br>
then continues in step 414, where control determines whether the counter is<br>
greater than a threshold. If so, control transfers to step 416; otherwise, control<br>
returns to step 406.<br>
[0041] In step 416, a trouble code is set. For example, a P0604 code<br>
may be set. When a trouble code is set, a malfunction indicator light may be<br>
illuminated. In addition, other remedial actions may be performed. In various<br>
implementations, the remedial action performed may be based on the value of<br>
the counter. As the value of the counter increases, the severity of the remedial<br>
action may increase.<br>
[0042] In step 410, control determines whether an authorized write to a<br>
lockable area is desired. If so, control transfers to step 418; otherwise, control<br>
transfers to step 420. In step 418, control reads the variable from the lockable<br>
area of memory. Control continues in step 422, where control verifies the locked<br>
variable with a dual store variable and/or a checksum. In various<br>
implementations, either dual store variables or checksums may be omitted. A<br>
single checksum may cover both the locked variable and the dual store variable.<br><br>
Alternatively, the locked variable and the dual store variable may be covered by<br>
different checksums.<br>
[0043] The dual store variable and/or the checksum may be located in<br>
the lockable area of memory. Alternatively, one or both of the dual store variable<br>
and the checksum may be located in general-purpose memory. The checksum<br>
may cover a section of lockable memory including the locked variable and other<br>
locked variables. A checksum value may be calculated and compared to the<br>
stored checksum.<br>
[0044] A discrepancy between the calculated checksum and the stored<br>
checksum may indicate that the locked variable, the checksum, or another<br>
variable covered by the checksum has been corrupted. Additionally, the<br>
checksum calculation may be erroneous. If the locked variable is inconsistent<br>
with the dual store variable or the checksum comparison fails, the write fails and<br>
control transfers to step 424. Alternatively (not shown), the write may still be<br>
performed, after which control transfers to step 424.<br>
[0045] If the locked variable is consistent with the dual store variable<br>
and the checksum is correct, control transfers to step 426. In step 426, the value<br>
to be written to the locked variable may be rate limited and/or magnitude limited.<br>
For example, an upper limit may be imposed on each change in the value of the<br>
locked variable. In addition, a maximum value of the locked variable may be<br>
defined.<br>
[0046] Control continues in step 428, where control disables interrupts<br>
and unlocks the lockable area of the memory. Interrupts are disabled so that<br><br>
interrupts cannot be serviced while the lockable memory is unlocked, thereby<br>
exposing unlocked memory to other functions. Control continues in step 430,<br>
where the write value, which may have been limited in step 426, is stored into the<br>
locked variable.<br>
[0047] If the dual store variable is stored in lockable memory, the dual<br>
store variable may be updated as well. In various implementations, the dual<br>
store variable may be the ones' complement of the locked variable. Control<br>
continues in step 432, where control locks the lockable memory and re-enables<br>
interrupts.<br>
[0048] Control continues in step 434, where control updates the<br>
checksum. In various implementations, the checksum may be updated by<br>
incrementing the previous checksum based upon the stored write value.<br>
Alternatively, the checksum may be recalculated from all the variables within the<br>
section of memory that the checksum covers. Control then returns to step 406.<br>
If the checksum is located within lockable memory, the checksum update may be<br>
performed between steps 428 and 432, while the lockable memory is unlocked.<br>
[0049] In step 420, control determines whether a qualified read from a<br>
lockable memory area is requested. If so, control transfers to step 450;<br>
otherwise, control transfers to step 452. In various implementations, a read from<br>
locked memory may be initiated via the same routine as a read to any other area<br>
of memory. Further, any process may be allowed to read values from the<br>
lockable area of memory.<br><br>
[0050] In step 450, the locked variable identified by the read request is<br>
read. Control continues in step 454, where control verifies that the locked<br>
variable is consistent with the dual stored variable and/or the checksum. If so,<br>
control transfers to step 456; otherwise, control transfers to step 458. In step<br>
456, control returns the value from the locked variable and continues in step 452.<br>
[0051] In step 458, control returns a default value. This default value<br>
may be stored in lockable memory or in general-purpose memory. Alternatively,<br>
the default value may be provided by the function requesting the read from the<br>
lockable area. In this way, the function specifies the value it will use if the read<br>
fails.<br>
[0052] Control then continues in step 424. In step 424, if the read or<br>
write failure is the result of a checksum error, control transfers to step 470;<br>
otherwise, control transfers to step 472. In step 470, control recalculates a<br>
checksum and continues in step 474. In step 474, control compares the<br>
recalculated checksum to the stored checksum. If they are equal, control<br>
transfers to step 472; otherwise, control transfers to step 476. If the new<br>
checksum is equal to the stored checksum, the checksum calculated in step 422<br>
or 454 was apparently miscalculated.<br>
[0053] In step 476, both the recalculated checksum and the calculated<br>
checksum from step 422 or 454 disagree with the stored checksum. The stored<br>
checksum may therefore be replaced. In various implementations, the checksum<br>
may be replaced when the recalculated checksum matches the calculated<br><br>
checksum. If these checksums are not equal, remedial action may be<br>
performed. Control then continues in step 472.<br>
[0054] In step 472, control increases the value of a countdown timer.<br>
The countdown timer may periodically decrease. Therefore, if the countdown<br>
timer has not been increased for a period of time, the countdown timer may<br>
reach zero. However, if the countdown timer is increased more frequently, the<br>
value in the countdown timer will rise. Control continues in step 478, where<br>
control determines whether the value of the countdown timer is greater than a<br>
threshold. If so, control transfers to step 480; otherwise, control returns to step<br>
406. In step 480, control performs remedial action. In various implementations,<br>
the remedial action may be to shut down the engine, after which control ends.<br>
[0055] In step 452, control determines whether a lockable area test<br>
should be conducted. If so, control transfers to step 482; otherwise, control<br>
returns to step 406. For example only, a test may be performed at periodic<br>
intervals. In step 482, control attempts to write to an area in lockable memory.<br>
Control continues in step 484, where control determines whether the attempted<br>
write was detected as unauthorized. If so, control returns to step 406; otherwise,<br>
control transfers to step 486. In step 486, a trouble code may be set. In addition,<br>
other remedial action may be performed. Control then returns to step 406.<br>
[0056] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br><br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification and the following claims.<br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1.	A system comprising:<br>
a general-purpose memory including data for a first set of<br>
addresses;<br>
a lockable memory including data for a second set of addresses;<br>
a memory management unit that selectively writes data to one of<br>
the general-purpose memory and the lockable memory, and that selectively locks<br>
the lockable memory by preventing writes to the lockable memory; and<br>
a processor that instructs the memory management unit to unlock<br>
the lockable memory before requesting a write to one of the second set of<br>
addresses.<br>
2.	The system of claim 1 wherein the processor selectively performs<br>
remedial action when a write request to the lockable memory is detected while<br>
the lockable memory is locked.<br>
3.	The system of claim 2 wherein the remedial action includes at least<br>
one of initiating an engine shutdown, limiting a torque of the engine, limiting an<br>
acceleration of a vehicle, limiting a throttle position of the engine, and setting a<br>
trouble code.<br><br>
4.	The system of claim 2 wherein the processor tests the memory<br>
management unit by requesting a sample write to the lockable memory while the<br>
lockable memory is locked, and performs remedial action unless the sample write<br>
is detected.<br>
5.	The system of claim 1 further comprising an error control module<br>
that selectively encodes data from the processor, transmits the encoded data to<br>
the memory management unit, and checks for errors when the encoded data is<br>
received from the memory management unit.<br>
6.	The system of claim 1 further comprising a dual store controller that<br>
receives a value from the processor, stores a first version of the value at a first<br>
end of a first memory region of the lockable memory, and stores a second<br>
version of the value at a first end of a second memory region of the lockable<br>
memory.<br>
7.	The system of claim 6 wherein the first and second versions are<br>
one of copies of each other, ones' complements of each other, and two's<br>
complements of each other.<br>
8.	The system of claim 6 wherein the first and second memory regions<br>
are adjacent, and the first ends of the first and second memory regions are at<br>
distal ends.<br><br>
9.	The system of claim 1 further comprising:<br>
a direct memory access (DMA) module that directly accesses the<br>
general-purpose memory and the lockable memory; and<br>
a DMA diagnostic module that selectively tests operation of the<br>
DMA module by instructing a predetermined value to be written to a selected<br>
address of one of the first and second sets of addresses, and comparing a value<br>
read from the selected address to the predetermined value.<br>
10.	The system of claim 1 wherein the processor disables interrupts<br>
while the lockable memory is unlocked and instructs the memory management<br>
unit to lock the lockable memory after requesting the write.<br><br>
11.	A method comprising:<br>
storing data for a first set of addresses;<br>
storing data for a second set of addresses;<br>
selectively locking the second set of addresses by preventing writes<br>
to the second set of addresses; and<br>
unlocking the second set of addresses before requesting a write to<br>
one of the second set of addresses.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 further comprising selectively performing<br>
remedial action when an attempted write to the lockable memory is detected<br>
while the second set of addresses is locked.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12 wherein the remedial action includes at<br>
least one of initiating an engine shutdown, limiting a torque of the engine, limiting<br>
an acceleration of a vehicle, limiting a throttle position of the engine, and setting<br>
a trouble code.<br>
14.	The method of claim 12 further comprising:<br>
requesting a sample write to the second set of addresses while the<br>
second set of addresses is locked; and<br>
performing remedial action unless the sample write is detected.<br><br>
15.	The method of claim 11 further comprising:<br>
selectively encoding data to be written;<br>
writing the encoded data;<br>
reading the encoded data; and<br>
checking the encoded data that was read for errors.<br>
16.	The method of claim 11 further comprising:<br>
storing a first version of a value at a first end of a first memory<br>
region of the second set of addresses; and<br>
storing a second version of the value at a first end of a second<br>
memory region of the second set of addresses.<br>
17.	The method of claim 16 wherein the first and second versions are<br>
one of copies of each other, ones' complements of each other, and two's<br>
complements of each other.<br>
18.	The method of claim 16 wherein the first and second memory<br>
regions are adjacent, and the first ends of the first and second memory regions<br>
are at distal ends.<br><br>
19.	The method of claim 11 further comprising:<br>
directly accesses the first and second sets of addresses via direct<br>
memory access (DMA);<br>
instructing a transfer of a predetermined value to a selected<br>
address of one of the first and second sets of addresses;<br>
reading the selected value; and<br>
comparing the value read to the predetermined value.<br>
20.	The method of claim 11 further comprising:<br>
disabling interrupts while the second set of addresses is unlocked;<br>
and<br>
locking the second set of addresses after requesting the write.<br><br>
A system comprises a general-purpose memory, a lockable memory, a<br>
memory management unit, and a processor. The general-purpose memory<br>
includes data for a first set of addresses. The lockable memory includes data for<br>
a second set of addresses. The memory management unit selectively writes<br>
data to one of the general-purpose memory and the lockable memory and<br>
selectively locks the lockable memory by preventing writes to the lockable<br>
memory. The processor instructs the memory management unit to unlock the<br>
lockable memory before requesting a write to one of the second set of<br>
addresses.</td>
