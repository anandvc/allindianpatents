Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions and in particular to detergents comprising lipolytic or lipase enzymes. <br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
Improved removal of greasy soils is a constant aim for laundry detergent manufacturers. In spite of the use of many effective surfactants and combinations of surfactants, especially when used at low water temperatures, many surfactant-based products still do not achieve complete removal of greasy/oily soils. Lipase enzymes have been used in detergents since the late 1980s for removal of fatty soils by breakdown of fatty soils into tri-glycerides.<br>
Until relatively recently, the main commercially available lipase enzymes, such as Lipolase (trade name, Novozymes) worked particularly effectively at the lower moisture levels of the drying phase of the wash process. These enzymes tended to produce significant cleaning only in the second wash step because the active site of the enzyme was occupied by water during the washing process, so that fat breakdown was significant only on soils remaining on laundered clothes during the drying stage, the broken down fats then being removed in the next washing step. However, more recently, higher efficiency lipases have been developed that also work effectively during the wash phase of the cleaning process, so that as well as cleaning in the second washing step, a significant improvement in cleaning effect due to lipase enzyme can be found in the first wash-cycle. Examples of such enzymes are as described in WO00/60063 and Research Disclsoure IP6553D. Such enzymes are referred to below as first wash lipases. Examples of such enzymes include certain variants of lipolase (wild-type Humicola lanuginosa) which should comprise one or more substitutions with positive amino acids near the N-terminal in the three-dimensional structure. The variants should further comprise a peptide addition at the C-terminal and/or should meet certain limitations on electrically charged amino acids at positions 90-101 and 210.<br>
The problem facing the present inventors was how to maximise performance from this new generation of enzymes. The present inventors found that whilst a small benefit<br>
could be achcivcd formulating such enzymes according to present day delergeni formulations by simply replacing existing lipasc cnzymes with the new generation of enzymes, a considerable improvement in performance was found by formulating the detergent compositions in a different way and even reducing the levels of some conventional detergent ingredients. Furthermore, it is known that the use of lipase enzymes in some conditions can generate malodours as the fatty soils are broken down to tri-glycerides. The present invention aims to alleviate that problem. Definition of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a detergent composition comprising a lipasc which is a polypcptidc having an amino acid sequence which: (a) has at least 90% identity with the wild-type lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa strain DSM 4109; (b) compared to said wild-type lipasc, comprises a substitution of an electrically neutral or negatively charged amino acid at the surface of the three-dimensional structure within 15 Angstroms of El or Q249 with a positively charged amino acid; and (c) comprises a peptide addition at the C-terminal; and/or (d) comprises a peptide addition at the N-terminal and/or (e) meets the following limitations: i) comprises a negative amino acid in position E210 of said wild-type lipase; ii) comprises a negatively charged amino acid in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase; and iii) comprises a neutral or negative amino acid at a position corresponding to N94 of said wild-type lipase and/or has a negative or neutral net electric charge in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase; the detergent composition having a reserve alkalinity of greater than 7.5 and comprising less than 15 wt% aluminosilicate (anhydrous basis) and/or phosphate builder.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a detergent composition comprising a lipase enzyme producing First Wash lard removal performance better than that produced by WT Lipolasc (tradcnamc from Novozymcs) using the Lard First Wash Test described below, and the detergent composition having a reserve alkalinity greater than 7.5 and comprising less than 15 wt% aluminosilicate builder and/or phosphate builder. WT Lipolase from Novozymes is described in US 5 869 438, seq#2.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, the detergent compositions of the invention comprise less than 15 wt% builders selected from aluminosilicate (zeolite) builder and/or<br>
phosphate builder. In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the compositions comprise less than 10 wt% zeolite and/or phosphate builder, or even less than 5 wt% or 4 wt % zeolite and/or phosphate builder.<br>
The present inventors have found that when a first wash lipase is used in conjunction with high reserve alkalinity and low levels of builder, the problems of malodour formation are reduced or eliminated. Without wishing to be bound by theory the inventors work suggests that this is because the alkalinity in the wash neutralises the malodorous fatly acids produced by break-down of fatly soils by the lipase enzymes and then after neutralisation, calcium salts of the fatty acids form having a significantly lower vapour pressure than the protonatcd fatty acids released by the enzymes.<br>
Surprisingly, even at the low levels of phosphate and zeolite builder, dramatically improved grease removal benefits are obtained compared to formulating lipase with conventional builder levels. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of divalent cations is enhancing lipase activity by (i) increasing the deposition of enzyme onto the fabric surface and/or (ii) enhancing the precipitation of insoluble fatty acid salts arising from the lipolysis enzymatic process.<br>
While builder reduction or elimination might be expected to raise significant stain removal negatives on, for example, paniculate and beverage stains, we have found that the compositions show unexpectedly good performance. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that this is due to fatty acids released by the lipase during lipolysis of fatty soils acting to (i) destabilize these stains via a hardness sequestration effect and (ii) reduce the wash pH slightly resulting in lightening of pH-scnsitive stains. Detailed Description of the Invention Lipase Enzyme<br>
The reference lipase used in this invention is the wild type lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa strain DSM 4109. It is described in EP258068 and EP305216 and has the amino acid sequence shown in positions 1-269 of SEQ ID NO: 2 of US5869438 (attached hereto). In this specification, the reference lipase is also referred to as Lipolase. Substitution with Positive Amino Acid<br>
The lipasc of (he invention comprises one or more (e.g. 2-4, particularly two) substitutions of an electrically neutral or negatively charged amino acid near El or Q249 with a positively charged amino acid, preferably R.<br>
The substitution is al the surface of the three-dimensional structure within 15 A of El orQ249, e.g. at any of positions 1-11,90,95, 169, 171-175, 192-211,213-226,228-258, 260-262.<br>
The substitution may be within 10 A of El or Q249, e.g. at any of positions 1-7, 10, 175, 195, 197-202, 204-206, 209, 215, 219-224, 230-239, 242-254.<br>
The substitution may be within 15 A of El, e.g. at any of positions 1-11, 169, 171, 192-199, 217-225, 228-240, 243-247, 249, 261-262.<br>
The substitution is most preferably within 10 A of El, e.g. at any of positions 1-7, 10, 219-224 and 230-239.<br>
Thus, some preferred substitutions are S3R, S224R, P229R, T231R, N233R, D234R and T244R. Peptide Addition at C-Terminal<br>
The lipase may comprise a peptide addition attached to C-terminal L269. The peptide addition improves the first-wash performance in a variety of detergents.<br>
The peptide addition preferably consists of 1-5 amino acids, e.g. 2, 3 or 4 amino acids. The amino acids of the peptide addition will be numbered 270, 271, etc.<br>
The peptide addition may consist of electrically neutral (e.g. hydrophobic) amino acids, e.g. PGL or PG. In an alternative embodiment, the lipase peptide addition consists of neutral (e.g. hydrophobic) amino acids and the amino acid C, and the lipasc comprises substitution of an amino acid with C at a suitable location so as to form a disulflde bridge with the C of the peptide addition. Examples are: 270C linked to G23C or T37C 271C linked to K24C, T37C, N26C or R81C 272C linked to D27C, T35C, E56C, T64C or R81C. Amino Acids at. Positions 90-101 and 210<br>
The lipase used in the invention preferably meets certain limitations on electrically charged amino acids at positions 90-101 and 210. Thus, amino acid 210 may be negative. E210 may be unchanged or it may have the substitution E210D/C/Y, particularly E210D.<br>
The lipasc may comprise a negatively charged amino acid at any of positions 90-101 (particularly 94-101), e.g. at position D96 and/or E99.<br>
Further, the lipase may comprise a neutral or negative amino acid at position N94, i.e. N94 (neutral or negative), e.g. N94N/D/E.<br>
Also, the lipase may have a negative or neutral net electric charge in the region 90-101 (particularly 94-101), i.e. the number of negative amino acids is equal to or greater than the number of positive amino acids. Thus, the region may be unchanged from Lipolase, having two negative amino acids (D96 and E99) and one positive (K98), and having a neutral amino acid at position 94 (N94), or the region may be modified by one or more substitutions.<br>
Alternatively, two of the three amino acids N94, N96 and E99 may have a negative or unchanged electric charge. Thus, all three amino acids may be unchanged or may be changed by a conservative or negative substitution, i.e. N94 (neutral or negative), D(negativc) and E99(negativc). Examples arc N94D/E and D96E. Also, one of the three may be substituted so as to increase the electric charge, i.e. N94 (positive), D96 (neutral or positive) or E99 (neutral or positive). Examples are N94K7R, D96I/L/N/SAV or E99N/Q/K/R/H.<br>
As discussed in WOOO/60063, the substitution of a neutral with a negative amino acid (N94D/E), may improve the performance in an anionic detergent. The substitution of a neutral amino acid with a positive amino acid (N94K/R) may provide a variant lipase with good performance both in an anionic detergent and in an anionic/non-ionic detergent (a detergent with e.g. 40-70 % anionic out of total surfactant). A substitution Q249R/K/H and/or a substitution of R209 with a neutral or negative amino acid (e.g. R209P/S) may be useful. The lipase may optionally comprise the substitution G91A.<br>
The lipase may optionally comprise substitutions of one or more additional amino acids. Such substitutions may, e.g. be made according to principles known in the art, e.g. substitutions described in WO92/05249, WO94/25577, WO95/22615, WO97/04079 and WO97/07202. Specific examples of suitable combinations of substitutions are given in the table bridging pages 4 and 5 of WOOO/60063. Nomenclature for amino acid modifications is as described in WOOO/60063.<br><br>
The preferred lipasc enzymes are described in WOOO/60063, the most preferred being Lipex (registered Iradcnamc of Novo/ymcs). a variant of the Humicola lanuginosa (Thermomyces lanuginosits) lipase (Lipolase registered tradename of Novo/.ymcs) with the mutations T231R and N233R.<br>
The lipase enzyme incorporated into the detergent compositions of the present invention is generally present in an amount of 10 to 20000 LU/g of the detergent composition, or even ] 00 to 10000 LU/g. The LU unit for lipase activity is defined in WO99/42566. The lipase dosage in the wash solution is typically from 0.01 to 5 mg/1 active lipase protein, more typically from 0.1 to 2mg/l as enzyme protein.<br>
The lipasc cnzymc may be incorporated into the detergent composition in any convenient form, generally in the form of a non-dusting granulate, a stabilised liquid or a protected, for example, coated enzyme particle. Lard First Wash Test<br>
Whether any specific lipasc enzyme gives better First Wash Jard removal performance than WT Lipolase (from Novozymes, described in US 5869438, seq#2), can be determined by comparing the performance results of WT Lipolase with the performance results of the specific lipase enzyme according to the following test: The wash performance of lipolytic enzymes is tested in a one cycle wash trial carried out in a thermostated Terg-O-Tometer (TOM) followed by line-drying. The experimental conditions are as follows: Wash liquor:   1000ml per beaker<br>
Swatches: 7 flat cotton swatches (9X9cm) (supplied by Warwick-Equcst) per beaker Stain: Lard coloured red with sudan red dye (Sigma) (0.75mg Sudan red/g lard). 50 µl of lard/sudan red heated to 70°C are applied to the centre of each swatch. After application of the stain the swatches are heated in an oven for 25 minutes at 75°C and then stored overnight at room temperature.Water for preparing wash liquor: 3.2mM Ca 2+/Mg2+ (in a ratio of 5:1) Detergent: 5g/l of detergent composition A. Detergent Composition A: 0.300g/l alky] sulphate (AS; C14-16) 0.650g/l of alcohol ethoxylate (AEO; C12-14, 6EO)<br>
1.750g/l/zeolite P<br>
0.145g/lNa2CO3<br>
0.02Og/l Sokalan CP5 (BASF)<br>
0.050g/l CMC(carboxy methyl cellulose)<br>
5g/l of detergent composition A are mixed into deionised water with added hardness (3.2<br>
mM Ca2/Mg2+ (5:1)) and the pH artificially adjusted to pH 10.2 by adding NaOH.<br>
Lipasc enzyme is added.<br>
Concentration of lipolytic en/.yme: 0 and 12500 LU/1<br>
Wash time: 20 minutes<br>
Wash temperature: 30°C<br>
Rinse: 15 minutes in running tap water<br>
Drying: overnight at room conditions (approx. 20°C, 30 -40 % RH).<br>
Evaluation: the reflectance was measured at 460nm.<br>
The percentage of lard removed is determined as:<br>
Delta reflectance (dR) defined as:<br>
(R(Swatches washed in detergent with lipase)-R(Swatches washed in detergent without<br>
lipase)<br>
The reflectance (which may also be termed remission) is measured on an Elrcpho 2000<br>
apparatus from Datacolor which illuminates the sample with 2 xenon blitz lamps and<br>
measures the amount of reflected light so that entirely white corresponds to a 100%<br>
reflectance and entirely black a 0% reflectance. Comparing the results for lard removal<br>
due to the presence of enzyme, lipase enzymes giving better performance than WT<br>
Lipolase™ are suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Reserve Alkalinity<br>
As used herein, the term "reserve alkalinity" is a measure of the buffering capacity of the<br>
detergent composition (g/NaOH/lOOg detergent composition) determined by titrating a<br>
1% (w/v) solution of detergent composition with hydrochloric acid to pH 7.5 i.e in order<br>
to calculate Reserve Alkalinity as defined herein:<br>
Reserve Alkalinity (to pH 7.5) as % alkali in g NaOH/100 g product = T x M x 40 x Vol<br>
lOxWtx Aliquot<br><br>
T         =	litre (ml) to pH 7.5<br>
M        -         Molarityof HCl = 0.2<br>
40       =         Molecular weight of NaOH<br>
Vol      =         Total volume (ie. 1000 ml)<br>
W        =         Weight of product (10 g)<br>
Aliquot =        (100ml)<br>
Obtain a lOg sample accurately weighed to two decimal places, of fully formulated detergent composition. The sample should be obtained using a Pascall sampler in a dust cabinet. Add the lOg sample to a plastic beaker and add 200 ml of carbon dioxide-free deionised water. Agitate using a magnetic stirrer on a stirring plate at 150 rpm until fully dissolved and for at least 15 minutes. Transfer the contents of the beaker to a 1 litre volumetric flask and make up to 1 litre with deionised water. Mix well and take a 100 mis ± 1 ml aliquot using a 100 mis pipette immediately. Measure and record the pH and temperature of the sample using a pH meter capable of reading to ±0.01pH units, with stirring, ensuring temperature is 21 °C +/- 2°C. Titrate whilst stirring with 0.2M hydrochloric acid until pH measures exactly 7.5. Note the millilitres of hydrochloric acid used. Take the average litre of three identical repeats. Carry out the calculation described above to calculate RA to pH 7.5.<br>
The RA of the detergent compositions of the invention will be greater than 7.5 and preferably greater than 8. The RA may be greater than 9 or even greater than 9.5 or 10 or higher. The RA may be up to 20 or higher.<br>
Adequate reserve alkalinity may be provided, for example, by one or more of alkali metal silicates (excluding crystalline layered silicate), typically amorphous silicate salts, generally 1.2 to 2.2 ratio sodium salts, alkali metal typically sodium carbonate, bicarbonate and/or sesquicarbonates. STPP and persalts such as perborates and percarbonates also contribute to alkalinity. Buffering is necessary to maintain an alkaline pH during the wash process counteracting the acidity of soils, especially fatty acids liberated by the lipase enzyme.<br>
The detergent composition preferably comprises from 0 wt% to 50 wt% silicate salt, more usually 5 to 30 wt% silicate salt, or 7 to 20 wt% silicate salt, usually sodium silicate.<br>
In order to provide the desired reserve alkalinity the detergent compositions of the invention may comprise a carbonate salt, typically from 1 wl% to 70 wl%, or from 5 wt% to 50 wt% or from 10 wt% to 30 wl% carbonate salt. Preferred carbonate salts are sodium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate and/or sodium sesquicarbonale. The carbonate salt may be incorporated into the detergent composition wholly or partially via a mixed salt such as Burkeite. A highly preferred carbonate salt is sodium carbonate. Preferably, the composition may comprise from 5 wt.% to 50 wt% sodium carbonate, or from 10 to 40 wt% or even 15 to 35 wl% sodium carbonate. It may also be desired for the composition to comprise from 1 wt% to 20 wt% sodium bicarbonate, or even 2 to 10 or 8 wt%.<br>
If zeolite is present, it may be desired for the weight ratio of sodium carbonate and/or sodium silicate to zeolite builder to be at least 5:1, preferably at least 10:1, or at least 15:1, or at least 20:1 or even at least 25:1<br>
The carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, is typically in particulate form, typically having a weight average particle size in the range of from 200 to 500 micrometers. However, it may be preferred for the carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, to be in micronised paniculate form, typically having a weight average particle size in the range of from 4 to 40 micrometers; this is especially preferred when the carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, is in the form of a co-particulate admixture with a detersive surfactant, such as an alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant.<br>
In order to provide the required reserve alkalinity, preferably the levels of carbonate and/or silicate salts, typically sodium carbonate and sodium silicate will be from 10 to 70 wt%, or from 10 or even 15 to 50 wt% based on the total weight of the composition. Builders<br>
Commercially available laundry detergents comprise strong inorganic builder, with either phosphate builder typically sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), or zeolite typically sodium aluminosilicate builder being used as the predominant strong builder. Generally such strong builders are present at relatively high levels such as 20 wt% or even higher, for example even up to 40 wt%. In accordance with the present invention, the amount of strong builder selected from phosphate and/or zeolite builder is less than 15 wt% based on the total weight of the detergent composition, preferably below 10 wt%, or even below 8 or 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 wt% .<br><br>
Thus, the compositions of the inversion may comprise from 0 wt% lo Jess than 15wt% zeolite builder, and 0 wi% to less than 15 wt% phosphate builder, the totaf amounl of phosphate and/or zeolite not exceeding 15 wt%, and preferably being below 10 wt% as described above. Preferably Ihc compositions of the invention comprise from 0 wt% to 8 \vl%, or from 0 wt% to 5 or 4 wi%, or from 0 wt% lo 3 or even Jess than 2 wt% zeolite builder. It may even be preferred for the composition to be essentially free from zeolite builder. By essentially free from zeolite builder it is typically meant that the composition comprises no deliberately added zeolite builder. This is especially preferred if it is desirable for the composition to be very highly soluble, to minimise the amount of water-insoluble residues (for example, which may deposit on fabric surfaces), and also when it is highly desirable to have transparent wash liquor. Zeolite builders include zeolite A, zeolite X, zeolite P and zeolite MAP.<br>
The compositions of the invention may comprise from 0 wt% to less than 15wt% phosphate builder. The composition preferably comprises from 0 wt.% to 8 wt%, or from 0 wt% to 5 or 4 wt.%, or from 0 wt% to 3 or even 2 wt% phosphate builder. It may even be preferred for the composition to be essentially free from phosphate builder. By essentially free from phosphate builder it is typically meant that the composition comprises no deliberately added phosphate builder. This is especially preferred if it is desirable for the composition to have a very good environmental profile. Phosphate builders include sodium tripolyphosphate.<br>
In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the total level of weak builders selected from layered silicate (SKS-6), citric acid, citrate salts and nitrilo triacetic acid or salt thereof is below 15 wt%, more preferably below 8 wt%, more preferably below 4 wt% or even below 3 or 2 wl% based on the total weight of the detergent composition. Typically the level of each of layered silicate, citric acid, citrate salts and nitrilo triacetic acid or salt, thereof will be below 10 wt% or even below 5 wt.% or wt% based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Although builders bring several benefits to the formulator, their main role is to sequester divalent metal ions (such as calcium and magnesium ions) from the wash solution that would otherwise interact negatively with The surfactant system. Builders are also effective at removing metal ions and inorganic soils from the fabric surface too,<br>
leading to improved removal of paniculate and beverage stains. It would therefore he expected that reduction of their levels would ncgalivcly impact on cleaning performance and therefore, preparation of detergent compositions that are effective with the claimed reduced levels of phosphate and zeolite builders is surprising. Surfactant<br>
A highly preferred adjunct component of the compositions of the invention is a surfactant. Preferably, the detergent composition comprises one or more surfactants. Typically, the detergent composition comprises (by weight of the composition) from 0% to 50%, preferably from 5% and more preferably from 10 or even 15 wt% to 40%, or to 30%, or to 20% one or more surfactants. Preferred surfactants arc anionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof.

Preferred anionic surfactants are C8-18 alkyl benzene sulphates and/or C8-18 alkyl benzene sulphonates. The alkyl chain of the C8-18 alkyl benzene sulphates and/or C8-18 alkyl benzene sulphonates may be linear or branched, preferred branched alkyl chains comprise one or more branched moieties that are C1-6 alky! groups.<br>

It may be preferred for the anionic detersive surfactant to be structurally modified in such a manner as to cause the anionic detersive surfactant to be more calcium tolerant and less likely to precipitate out of the wash liquor in the presence of free calcium ions. This structural modification could be the introduction of a methyl or ethyl moiety in the vicinity of the head group of the anionic detersive surfactant, as this can lead to a more calcium tolerant anionic detersive surfactant due to steric hindrance of the head group, which may reduce the affinity of the anionic detersive surfactant for complexing with free calcium cations in such a manner as to cause precipitation out of solution. Other structural modifications include the introduction of functional moieties, such as an aminc moiety, in the alkyl chain of the anionic detersive surfactant; this can lead to a more calcium tolerant anionic detersive surfactant because the presence of a functional group in the alkyl chain of an anionic detersive surfactant may minimise the undesirable physicochemical property of the anionic detersive surfactant to form a smooth crystal structure in the presence of free calcium ions in the wash liquor. This may reduce the tendency of the anionic detersive surfactant to precipitate out of solution. Alkoxvlated anionic surfactants<br>
The composition may comprise an alkoxylated anionic surfactant. Where present such a surfactant will generally be present in amounts form 0.1 wt% to 40 wt%, generally<br>
0.1 to 10 wt%based on the detergent composition as a whole. It may he preferred for the composition to comprise from 3wt% to 5wt% alkoxylatcd anionic detersive surfactant, or it may be preferred for the composition to comprise from 1 wt% to 3wt% alkoxylaled anionic detersive surfactant.<br>

Preferably, the alkoxylaled anionic detersive surfactant is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstiuted C12-18 alkyl ethoxylated sulphate having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to 10. Most preferably, the alkoxylatcd anionic detersive surfactant is a linear unsubstitutcd C12-18 alkyl ethoxylaled sulphate having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 3 to 7.<br>
The alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant may also increase the non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant activity by making the non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant less likely to precipitate out of solution in the presence of free calcium cations. Preferably, the weight ratio of non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant to alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is less than 5:1, or less than 3:1, or less than 1.7:1, or even less than 1.5:1. This ratio gives optimal whiteness maintenance performance combined with a good hardness tolcrcncy profile and a good sudsing profile. However, it may be preferred that the weight ratio of non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant to alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is greater than 5:1, or greater than 6:1, or greater than 7:1, or even greater than 10:1. This ratio gives optimal greasy soil cleaning performance combined with a good hardness tolcrcncy profile, and a good sudsing profile.

The composition may comprise from 1 wt% to 7wt% or from 2wt% to 4wt% non-ionic detersive surfactant. The inclusion of<br><br>
non-ionic detersive surfactant in the composition helps to provide a good overall cleaning profile, especially when laundering at high temperatures such as 60oC or higher.<br>

Non-ionic surfactants having a degree of elhoxylation from 3 to 9 may be especially useful either. Nonionic surfactants having an HLB value of from 13 to 25, such as C8-18 alkyl ethoxylated alcohols having an average degree of ethoxylation from 15 to 50, or even from 20 to 50 may also be preferred non-ionic surfactants in the compositions of the invention. Examples of these latter non-ionic surfactants are Lulensol AO30 and similar materials disclosed in WO04/041982. These may be beneficial as they have good lime soap dispersant properties.<br>
The non-ionic detersive surfactant not only provides additional soil cleaning performance but may also increase the anionic detersive surfactant activity by making the anionic detersive surfactant less likely to precipitate out of solution in the presence of free calcium cations.

This minimises any effect that any cationic detersive surfactant may have on the undesirable precipitation of the anionic detersive surfactant, and also ensures that upon contact with water, the resultant wash liquor is not cloudy. If cationic surfactant is present, preferably the weight ratio of non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant to cationic detersive surfactant is in the range of from 5:1 to 25:1, more preferably from 5:1 to 20:1 or from 6:1 to 15:1, or from 7:1 to 10:1, or even from 8:1 to 9:1.<br>

The levels of the surfactants arc as described above under the specific classes of surfactants. Presence of AE3S and/or MES in the system is preferred on account of their exceptional hardness-tolerance and ability to disperse lime soaps which are formed during the wash by lipase.<br>
In a further embodiment, the surfactant in the detergent compositions of the invention comprises at least three surfactants, at least one from each of the first and second groups defined above and in addition a third surfactant, preferably also from the first or second groups defined above.<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may surprisingly contain relatively low levels of surfactant and yet still perform good cleaning, on account of the soil removal functionality delivered by the lipase, so that the overall level of surfactant may be below 12 wt%, or 10 wt% or 8 wt% based on total weight of the composition Polymeric polycarboxylate<br>

Particularly preferred materials are cocamidopropyl betaine, cocomonoethanolamide and amine oxide. A suitable amine oxide is Admox 12, supplied by Albemarle. Lime Soap Dispersants<br>
Since these lipase enzymes release soil into the wash water, it may be particularly preferred for the detergent compositions of the invention to additionally comprise anti-redeposition polymers such as the polymeric polycarboxylates described above. In addition, or alternatively, cellulose ethers such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) will be useful. A suitable CMC is Tylose CR1500 G2, sold by Clariant.
