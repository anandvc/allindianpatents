				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention is generally directed to oral compositions containing an<br>
encapsulated active ingredient. In particular, the invention is directed to oral compositions<br>
including an active ingredient encapsulated within a reactive barrier coating for substantially<br>
preventing a stability-limiting ingredient in the composition from reacting with the active.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Unblemished white teeth have long been considered cosmetically desirable.<br>
Unfortunately, in the absence of thorough dental cleaning, teeth can become discolored or<br>
stained from color-causing substances present in food, beverages, tobacco, and the like, and<br>
internal sources such as blood, amalgam-based fillings, and antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline).<br>
Currently, there are a number of methods for removing stains in teeth. These<br>
methods are generally based on the use of abrasives, hydrolytic agents or oxidizing agents to<br>
break down the staining material. For example, mechanical methods of tooth cleaning are<br>
known whereby the stain is mechanically abraded through the use of abrasives or polishing<br>
agents normally employed in toothpaste preparations. Typical preparations containing<br>
abrasives are toothpastes, gels or powder dentifrices, which require close contact with the<br>
teeth. Brushing and similar scrubbing or polishing action is typically required as a<br>
compliment to successful stain removal. Typical abrasives include hydrated silica, calcium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and alumina.<br>
Hydrolytic agents including proteolytic enzymes can also be used to whiten teeth.<br>
These products are usually in the form of pastes or gels, and function to whiten teeth by<br>
removing the plaque and calculus that have entrapped the stain.<br>
Oxidizing agents such as urea peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or calcium peroxide,<br>
represent the most common forms of whitening agents for tooth enamels. It is believed that<br>
peroxides whiten teeth by releasing hydroxyl radicals capable of breaking down the<br>
plaque/stain complex into a form that can be flushed away or removed by an abrasive.<br><br>
Other active stain-removing components include surface-active agents, such as<br>
anionic surfactants and chelators, which have been incorporated into stain-removing<br>
compositions because of their stain-removing properties. For example, anionic surfactants<br>
typically employed in dentifrice compositions include sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium N-<br>
lauryl sarcosinate. Furthermore, chelators, such as polyphosphates, are typically employed<br>
in dentifrice compositions as tartar control ingredients. For example, tetrasodium<br>
pyrophosphate and sodium tri-polyphosphate are typical ingredients found in such<br>
compositions.<br>
Stain-removing gum compositions are known. For example, gum compositions<br>
including sodium tripolyphosphate and xylitol are known. Also, gum compositions are<br>
known, which include hexametaphosphate and an abrasive silica material. Moreover, a<br>
dental gum is known, which includes the following ingredients: sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
tetrasodium pyrophosphate, a silica abrasive and zinc acetate. A whitening gum composition<br>
is also known, which includes the abrasives sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, and<br>
is sold under the brand name V6®.<br>
Moreover, stain-removing gum compositions are known that include anionic<br>
surfactants such as fatty acid salts. For example, sodium stearate is a fatty acid salt<br>
employed in a gum product sold under the brand name Trident White® (see U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,471,945,6,479,071 and 6,696,044). Furthermore, copending, commonly-owned U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 10/901,511 discloses stain-removing gum compositions containing a<br>
salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
Unlike toothpaste, mouthwash and other dentifrice compositions, tooth whitening<br>
gum compositions present unique problems. For example, certain tooth whitening active<br>
ingredients can react adversely with other ingredients in gums. This results in short shelf-<br>
life, as well as the production of undesirable by-products. For example, certain anionic<br>
surfactants interact with lecithin, which is often used in gums and other food products to help<br>
different parts mix together well. Moreover, phosphate salts, such as polyphosphates, and<br>
certain anionic surfactants undergo changes in acidic formulations, such as fruit gums.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it would be beneficial to provide further gum compositions<br>
for cleaning teeth. In particular, it would be beneficial to provide a tooth whitening gum<br><br>
where the stain-removing active agent was encapsulated within a barrier coating that<br>
substantially prevents the active agent from reacting with other gum ingredients.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to oral compositions in which an active<br>
ingredient has been effectively incorporated therein so that the reaction between a stability-<br>
limiting ingredient in the composition and the active ingredient is limited. In so doing, the<br>
oral composition is stabilized, shelf-life is increased and the active remains available for its<br>
intended purpose.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an oral composition including<br>
a carrier composition and an active composition. The carrier composition may include a first<br>
reactive component, which is also referred to as the stability limiting component. If the first<br>
reactive component is exposed to the active composition in absence of the reactive barrier<br>
coating described below, the first reactive component may react with the active resulting in<br>
less active being available for its intended use.<br>
The active composition includes at least one active component encapsulated in a<br>
coating, which is also referred to as the reactive barrier coating. The reactive barrier coating<br>
may include a hydrophilic material; and a second reactive component. An interaction<br>
between the first and second reactive components preserves the activity and/or availability of<br>
the active.<br>
In the present specification, the terms "first reactive component" and "stability-<br>
limiting component" may be used interchangeably. The first reactive component may react<br>
"unfavorably with the active component.<br>
The term "second reactive component" may be used interchangeably with the terms<br>
"reactive barrier agent", "reactive barrier component" and the like. The second reactive<br>
component assists in preventing any undesirable reaction or interaction between the first<br>
reactive component and the active.<br>
The phrase "preserve the activity and/or availability of the active" when used in the<br>
present invention includes protecting the active component such that it will maintain its<br><br>
activity, or at least any substantial loss of activity and/or degradation of the active will be<br>
reduced during manufacture and storage over a given time period, as compared to similar<br>
compositions not practicing the present invention. The phrase includes maintaining the<br>
active chemically or physically intact for a given time period as discussed herein. In<br>
particular, through the interaction of the first and second reactive components in the oral<br>
composition, less of the first reactive component (i.e., the stability-limiting component) is<br>
capable of interacting with the active component. As a result, there is a reduction in the<br>
extent and/or rate of degradation of the active component by the first reactive component.<br>
For example, in some embodiments where the active is a chelating agent, such as a<br>
polyphosphate, the polyphosphate is coated with a reactive barrier coating, which includes a<br>
buffer. The buffer is the second reactive component, which interacts with a first reactive<br>
component, such as a food acid. As a result of the reaction between the buffer (second<br>
reactive component) and the food acid (first reactive component), the polyphosphate active is<br>
chemically and physically "protected". That is to say, its activity is maintained or any loss of<br>
its activity is reduced than would otherwise be possible.<br>
The reactive barrier coating extends the stability of the oral composition, as compared<br>
to the same composition in the absence of the coating. In particular, the coating provides a<br>
physical and chemical barrier between the active and a stability-limiting component in the<br>
oral composition.<br>
The oral compositions of this invention can include, but are not limited to, any<br>
number of compositions, including gums, confectionary compositions, toothpastes and<br>
mouthwashes. For example, certain aspects of the present invention relate to tooth whitening<br>
gum compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, the tooth whitening gum composition may include a gum base<br>
and an active composition. The gum base includes at least one first reactive component,<br>
which upon exposure to one or more active components, reacts therewith to reduce the<br>
activity of the active. The active composition includes at least one active component<br>
encapsulated in a reactive barrier coating. The reactive barrier coating includes a<br>
hydrophilic material; and a second reactive component, which interacts with the first reactive<br>
component to preserve the activity and/or availability of the active.<br><br>
Other aspects of the present invention relate to methods for preparing and using the<br>
inventive oral compositions herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides a method for removing stains from<br>
teeth. This method includes providing an oral composition including a carrier composition<br>
and an active composition. The carrier composition includes at lease one first reactive<br>
component. The active composition includes at least one active component encapsulated in a<br>
reactive barrier coating. The reactive barrier coating includes a hydrophilic material; and at<br>
least one second reactive component, wherein an interaction of the first and second reactive<br>
components preserves the activity and/or availability of the active. The method further<br>
includes contacting the teeth with the provided oral composition for a sufficient time to<br>
remove stains from the teeth. For example, in one embodiment, stains may be removed from<br>
teeth by chewing an effective amount of a stain-removing gum composition provided herein.<br>
Gum compositions provided herein can be prepared in any number of ways. For<br>
example, the active component can be coated with a water-soluble hydrophilic material and<br>
the reactive barrier agent, and then combined with a gum base, or with a coating for the gum,<br>
or with both.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of preparing a tooth<br>
whitening gum composition that includes: encapsulating a tooth whitening active component<br>
in a reactive barrier coating. The reactive barrier coating includes a hydrophilic material;<br>
and a component reactive with a stability-limiting component in the gum composition. The<br>
method also includes heating a gum base to soften the base; mixing the softened gum base<br>
with the encapsulated tooth whitening active component to obtain a substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture; cooling the mixture; and forming the cooled mixture into individual<br>
gum pieces. Other components, such as including, but not limited to, sweeteners, flavorants,<br>
fillers and colorants may also be included in the gum base.<br>
In further embodiments, the present invention provides a method of preparing a tooth<br>
whitening gum composition that may include suspending tooth whitening active particles in a<br>
fluidized air stream; and spraying a reactive barrier coating onto the suspended active<br>
particles, wherein the coating includes a hydrophilic material and a component reactive with<br>
a stability-limiting component in the gum composition.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is<br>
synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-<br>
ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its<br>
use in the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
As used herein, the term "gum compositions" is intended to include any gum<br>
compositions, including "chewing gum <br>
As used herein, the term "active component" refers to any encapsulated material<br>
included in the oral compositions of the present invention, wherein the active provides some<br>
desirable property upon release from encapsulation (for example, when the encapsulated<br>
material has been subjected to mastication). Examples of suitable actives include tooth<br>
whitening agents, such as surfactants, chelating agents, hydrolytic agents, oxidizing agents<br>
and high intensity sweeteners. Other examples of suitable actives include flavors,<br>
medicaments, vitamins, etc.<br>
The term "fatty acid salt" is a compound formed by replacing hydrogen in a fatty acid<br>
by a metal (or a radical that acts like a metal).<br>
The term "phosphate salt" is meant to encompass pyrophosphates, triphosphates,<br>
polyphosphates, polyphosphonates and combinations thereof.<br>
The present invention is directed to compositions with stain-removing properties for<br>
producing a whitening effect on dental surfaces that are treated with the same. Such<br>
compositions are especially suitable for removing stains, which adhere to, or are entrapped in<br>
materials on, the surface of teeth and for preventing build-up of the stain entrapping material<br>
and stains on dental surfaces. The compositions of the present invention are retained in the<br>
oral cavity for a sufficient time to contact the dental surfaces for purposes of providing<br>
beneficial dental effects.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be in a form selected from, for<br>
example, dentifrices including mouthwashes, mouth rinses, toothpastes, tooth powders, tooth<br><br>
hardeners, antiplaque compositions, dental creams, dental flosses, liquids, gels, and the like;<br>
chewing gums, including center-filled gums, and the like; and confectionaries, including<br>
mints, lozenges, and the like. In some embodiments, the compositions of the present<br>
invention are in the form of chewing gums.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a stain-removing effective amount of a an<br>
encapsulated tooth whitening active is employed in the compositions of the present invention<br>
to provide effective stain-removing activity. For example, the encapsulated tooth whitening<br>
active may be one or more of the following: chelating agents, such as phosphate salts,<br>
surfactants, such as fatty acid salts, hydrolytic agents, such as proteolytic enzymes, and<br>
oxidizing agents, such as peroxides. Such agents facilitate the effective removal of dental<br>
stains.<br>
Tooth whitening agents can substantially interact with other ingredients in oral<br>
compositions. This results in short shelf-life, as well as the production of undesirable by-<br>
products. The present invention is directed to overcoming this problem.<br>
For example, by encapsulating the active within a reactive barrier coating, the<br>
physical and chemical interaction between a stability-limiting component in the oral<br>
composition and the active is substantially reduced. Thereby, the oral composition is<br>
stabilized. The reactive barrier coating includes a water-soluble hydrophilic material that<br>
provides a physical barrier between the active ingredient and the stability-limiting ingredient.<br>
In some embodiments, the water-soluble hydrophilic material is selected from at least one of<br>
the following: gum arabic, starch, gelatin, alginates, alkyl and hydroxycellulose, carrageenen,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, gum agar, hydroxyethylcellulose, poly(acrylic acid), polyethylene<br>
glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, modified starch, xanthan gum, zein, polyols,<br>
and guar gum.<br>
In addition to providing a physical barrier between the active ingredient and the<br>
stability-limiting component, the barrier coating further provides a chemical barrier between<br>
these components. In particular, the reactive barrier coating includes a reactive agent that<br>
reacts with a stability-limiting component in the composition so as to chemically neutralize<br>
its effect on the active. This prevents premature degradation of the active and stabilizes the<br>
oral composition. Applicants have discovered that encapsulating the tooth whitening active<br><br>
component in the reactive barrier coating increases the shelf-life of the oral composition and<br>
avoids the production of undesirable by-products.<br>
In some embodiments, the interaction of the first and second reactive components<br>
lessens the capability of the first reactive component to interact with the at least one active<br>
component. In further embodiments, the degradation of at least one active component, over<br>
time, is lessened due to the interaction of the first and second reactive components, as<br>
compared to the composition without the interaction.<br>
In other embodiments, this interaction of the first and second reactive components<br>
increases the shelf-life of the oral composition as measured by the presence of higher active<br>
component amounts, as compared to the composition without the interaction. In still other<br>
embodiments, the interaction of the first and second reactive components provides a shelf-life<br>
of at least about one year, as measured by the presence of at least 75% of the active<br>
remaining. In yet still other embodiments, the interaction of the first and second reactive<br>
components provides a shelf-life of at least about six months, as measured by the presence of<br>
at least 90% of the active remaining.<br>
Chelating agents are one group of encapsulated tooth whitening agents suitable for<br>
use in the compositions of the present invention. Chelators are capable of strongly binding<br>
with metal ions, such as calcium. For example, chelating agents are able to complex calcium<br>
found in the cell walls of bacteria, a major component of plaque. Chelating agents can also<br>
disrupt plaque by removing calcium from the calcium bridges, which help hold the plaque<br>
matrix together.<br>
Examples of suitable chelators include phosphate salts. In some embodiments, the<br>
phosphate salt is selected from one of the following: pyrophosphates, triphosphates,<br>
polyphosphates, polyphosphonates and combinations thereof.<br>
As shown in Table 1 below, polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STP)<br>
and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), which are commonly employed in tooth whitening<br>
gum compositions, react with stability-limiting acids (e.g., citric acid). This reduces the<br>
shelf-life of the oral composition and results in the production of undesirable by-products.<br>
By encapsulating the polyphosphate active in a barrier coating, the adverse effects of the acid<br><br>
on the polyphosphate are reduced. In some embodiments, the barrier coating for the<br>
polyphosphate includes one of the following hydrophilic materials: gum arabic, starch or<br>
gelatin. The barrier coating for the polyphosphate may also include a phosphate buffer as a<br>
reactive agent. The phosphate buffer, when in the presence of a stability-limiting acid, reacts<br>
therewith to stabilize the oral composition.<br><br>
Encapsulating sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) increases its stability in acidic gum as<br>
compared to free STP. The result is an increase in the shelf-life of the gum, and a reduction<br>
in the production of undesirable by-products.<br>
Hydrolytic agents are another group of encapsulated tooth whitening agents suitable<br>
for use in the oral compositions of the present invention. Hydrolytic agents function to<br>
whiten teeth by removing the plaque and calculus that entrap the stain. Referring to Table 1<br>
above, examples of hydrolytic agents which may be employed in the oral compositions of the<br>
present invention include proteolytic enzymes (e.g., papaine), lipase, amylase and<br>
glucoamylase. Such hydrolytic agents react unfavorably with the following stability-limiting<br>
components: flavors, peroxides, florides and water. By coating the enzyme with a material<br>
such as gum arabic, starch or gelatin, a physical barrier against these stability-limiting<br>
components is provided. Preferably, the barrier coating for the enzyme further includes one<br>
of the following reactive barrier agents: phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, silica or reducing<br><br>
agents. These reactive agents, when in the presence of stability-limiting flavors, peroxides,<br>
florides or water, react therewith to stabilize the oral composition.<br>
With further reference to Table 1, oxidizing agents, such as peroxides, are another<br>
group of encapsulated tooth whitening agents suitable for use in the oral compositions of the<br>
present invention. Peroxides are believed to whiten teeth by releasing hydroxyl radicals<br>
capable of breaking down the plaque-stain complex into a form that can be flushed away or<br>
removed by abrasives. Encapsulating peroxides in a material such as gum arabic, starch or<br>
guar gum substantially physically prevents peroxides from interacting with stability-limiting<br>
flavors or aldehydes, which are often present in oral compositions. The reactive agent in the<br>
coating provides the chemical barrier between the active and the stabihty-limiting<br>
component. In some embodiments, the reactive agent in the barrier coating for the peroxide<br>
is silica or a buffer, such as citrate buffer, which in the presence of stability-limiting flavors<br>
or aldehydes, react therewith to stabilize the oral composition.<br>
Surfactants, such as anionic surfactants, are yet another example of a group of<br>
encapsulated tooth whitening agents suitable for use in the inventive compositions. Certain<br>
fatty acid salts interact with lecithin, which is often used in gums and other food products to<br>
help different parts mix together well. Moreover, fatty acid salts can undergo changes in<br>
acidic formulations, such as fruit gums. By encapsulating surfactants in a physical barrier<br>
coating of a water-soluble hydrophilic material, such as gum arabic, starch or gelatin, these<br>
adverse interactions are substantially reduced. Preferably, a chemical barrier is also<br>
provided. For example, in some embodiments, the barrier coating for the surfactant includes<br>
a buffer, such as a citrate buffer, which can neutralize the effect of a stability-limiting acid.<br>
Alternatively, the barrier coating for the surfactant may include a phosphate buffer, which<br>
can react/interact with lecithin, thereby reducing any interaction between lecithin and the<br>
surfactant active.<br>
Intense sweeteners, such as Neotame and Aspartame, are other examples of suitable<br>
encapsulated active agents suitable for use in the inventive compositions. In particular, it is<br>
common to employ such sugar substitutes in tooth whitening gum compositions. As shown<br>
in Table 1, encapsulating intense sweeteners in a material such as gum arabic, starch or guar<br>
gum substantially prevents these actives from physically interacting with stability-limiting<br>
flavors, aldehydes or glycerin which are often present in oral compositions. The barrier<br><br>
coating for the sweetener may further include a buffer, such as a citrate buffer. A citrate<br>
buffer, when in the presence of flavors, aldehydes or glycerin, reacts therewith to further<br>
stabilize the oral composition.<br>
The term "stain-removing effective amount" as used herein is an amount of stain-<br>
removing agent(s) disclosed herein that is sufficient to prevent, eliminate, or at least reduce,<br>
the presence of stains on dental surfaces in warm-blooded animals including humans, but low<br>
enough to avoid any undesirable side effects. This stain-removing effective amount of stain-<br>
removing agent(s) may vary with the type and extent of the particular stain, the age and<br>
physical condition of the warm-blooded animal, including humans being treated, the duration<br>
of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, the specific stain-removing agent employed,<br>
and the particular carrier from which the stain-removing agent is applied.<br>
The concentration of the stain-removing agents in the composition of the present<br>
invention depends on the type of composition (e.g., toothpaste, mouthwash and rinse,<br>
lozenge, chewing gum, confectionary, and the like) used to apply the stain-removing agents<br>
to the dental surfaces, due to the differences in the efficiency of the compositions contacting<br>
the teeth and due also to the effective amount of the composition generally used. The<br>
concentration may also depend on the levels of the stains present.<br>
Except as otherwise noted, the amount of the components incorporated into the<br>
compositions according to the present invention is designated as percentage by weight based<br>
on the total weight of the composition.<br>
As described above, an oral composition of the present invention can be a gum<br>
composition, such as chewing gum composition. The chewing gum compositions of the<br>
present invention may be coated or uncoated, and be in the form of slabs, sticks, pellets, balls<br>
and the like. The composition of the different forms of the chewing gum compositions will<br>
be similar but may vary with regard to the ratio of the components. For example, coated gum<br>
compositions may contain a lower percentage of softeners. Pellets and balls may have a<br>
chewing gum core, which has been coated with either a sugar solution or a sugarless solution<br>
to create the hard shell. Slabs and sticks are usually formulated to be softer in texture than<br>
the chewing gum core.<br><br>
Center-filled gum is another common gum form. The gum portion has a similar<br>
composition and mode of manufacture to that described above. However, the center-fill is<br>
typically an aqueous liquid or gel, which is injected into the center of the gum during<br>
processing. The tooth whitening agent(s) could optionally be incorporated into the center-fill<br>
during manufacture of the fill, incorporated directly into the chewing gum portion of the total<br>
gum composition, or both. The center-filled gum may also be optionally coated and may be<br>
prepared in various forms, such as in the form of a lollipop.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, a coated gum may be formed, wherein<br>
the tooth whitening agent(s) is in at least one of the core or the gum coating. For example, an<br>
abrasive agent may be incorporated into the coating, and surface actives (e.g., surfactant<br>
and/or chelating agent) may be incorporated into the gum base. By providing the abrasive in<br>
the coating, the stain is first mechanically abraded by the abrasive in combination with<br>
chewing, which requires close contact with the teeth. In particular, the abrasive tends to have<br>
a short time before it goes into solution. Whereas the abrasive continues to have a chemical<br>
effect in removing the stain after it is released from the coating into the saliva, it may be<br>
advantageous to enhance the mechanical abrasion initially by providing it in the coating<br>
layer. Furthermore, the coating provides another effective vehicle for delivering a surface-<br>
active.<br>
It is also well within the contemplation of the present invention that the tooth<br>
whitening agent(s) can be incorporated into the gum base. The gum base provides another<br>
effective vehicle for delivering the tooth whitening agent(s), such as abrasives and surface-<br>
active agents because it permits protracted contact of the tooth whitening agents with the<br>
teeth. For example, the tooth whitening agent(s) can chemically remove the stain once<br>
released from the gum base and/or gum coating into saliva.<br>
Chewing gum compositions of the present invention may include a gum base and<br>
most of the other typical chewing composition components, such as sweeteners, softeners,<br>
flavorants and the like. At least one encapsulated tooth whitening active is employed in some<br>
embodiments of the gum compositions.<br>
The gum compositions of some embodiments have an increased "shelf-life" as a result<br>
of the incorporation of me second reactive component. The second reactive component<br><br>
characteristics. The presence of a hydroxy group on long-chain fatty acids increases water<br>
solubility. Therefore, Applicants have found that water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids<br>
having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms are useful in the compositions of the present invention. In<br>
particular, the water solubility of a hydroxy fatty acid salt allows it to solubilize an<br>
established stain into the saliva and loosens it so that it can be easily removed by chewing,<br>
brushing or saliva.<br>
In some embodiments, the inventive oral compositions can include other anionic or<br>
nonionic surfactants. For example, other suitable surfactants may include the following<br>
anionic or non-ionic surfactants: sulfated butyl oleate, sodium oleate, salts of fumaric acid,<br>
potassium glomate, organic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, stearyl monoglyceridyl<br>
citrate, succistearin, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, glycerol tristearate, lecithin, hydroxylated<br>
lecithin, sodium lauryl sulfate, acetylated monoglycerides, succinylated monoglycerides,<br>

steary1-2-lactylate, sodium stearyl lactylate, lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and<br>
propylene glycerol, glycero1-lactoesters of C8-C24 fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of C8-C24<br>
fatty acids, propylene glycol alginate, sucrose C8-C24 fatty acid esters, diacetyl tartaric and<br>
citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, triacetin, sarcosinate surfactants, isethionate<br>
surfactants, tautate surfactants, pluronics, polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols,<br>
products derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction product of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene diamine, ethylene oxide condensates of aliphatic alcohols, long<br>
chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides, long chain dialkyl<br>
sulfoxides and mixtures thereof.<br>

weight of the total composition. In some embodiments, the surfactant may be present at<br>
about 0.05 to about 10% by weight of the total composition. Moreover, in some<br>
embodiments, the surfactant may be present in amounts of about 0.05 to about 2% by weight<br>
of the total composition.<br>
Chelating Agents<br>
As described above, the oral compositions of the present invention may include<br>
encapsulated chelating agents. Chelating agents strongly interact with metal ions, such as the<br><br>
calcium found in the cell walls of mouth bacteria. Chelating agents can also disrupt plaque<br>
by removing calcium from the calcium bridges which help hold this biomass intact.<br>
One group of agents suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the<br>
present invention are phosphate salts. In some embodiments, the phosphate salt selected<br>
from the following: pyrophosphates, triphosphates, polyphosphates, polyphosphonates and<br>
combinations thereof. The chelating agent can be a dialkali metal pyrophosphate salt, a tetra<br>
alkali polyphosphate salt or a combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the<br>
chelating agent can be selected from the following: tetrasodium pyrophosphate,<br>
tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and<br>
combinations of these. Other chelating agents that can be employed in the compositions of<br>
the present invention may include tartaric acid and salts thereof, citric acid and alkali metal<br>
citrates and mixtures thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the chelating agent is present in amounts of about 0.001 to<br>
about 5% by weight of the inventive oral composition. Furthermore, in some embodiments,<br>
the chelating agent is present in amounts of about 0.5 to about 3% by weight of the oral<br>
composition.<br>
Hvdrolvtic Agents<br>
In some embodiments the oral compositions of the present invention include<br>
encapsulated hydrolytic agents. Suitable hydrolytic agents include enzymes. For example, a<br>
protease, lipase, amylase for glucoamylase may be included in the invention compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, the enzyme is present in amounts of about 0.01% to about<br>
5.0% of the inventive oral composition. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the enzyme is<br>
present in amounts of about 0.01% to about 3.0%, or more specifically from about 0.1% to<br>
about 1.0 % by weight of the oral composition.<br>
Oxidizing Agents<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention may include encapsulated oxidizing<br>
agents. Suitable oxidizing agents include peroxide compounds. Useful peroxides should<br>
contain an 0-0 bond, which can break down to provide at least one active specie. Examples<br>
of preferred peroxide compounds are inorganic peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide,<br><br>
strontium peroxide, zinc peroxide or magnesium peroxide, and organic peroxides including,<br>
but not limited to, carbamide peroxide. The amount of the peroxide compound incorporated<br>
into the present composition will vary depending upon the particular individual or<br>
combinations of stain removing agents employed and the type of other components or<br>
components of the compositions and their respective amounts. The peroxide compound may<br>
be present in a stain removing effective amount of from about 0.01% to 10%, preferably from<br>
about 0.1% to 5%, and more preferably from about 0.2% to 3% by weight based on the total<br>
weight of the composition.<br>
High Intensity Sweeteners<br>
In some embodiments the oral compositions of the present invention include<br>
encapsulated high intensity sweeteners. High intensity sweeteners include sucralose,<br>
aspartame, neotame, salts of acesulfame, and the like. Such sweeteners are desirably present<br>
in amounts up to about 1.0% by weight of the oral composition.<br>
Abrasive Agent<br>
In some embodiments, the oral compositions of the present invention include an<br>
abrasive agent. Suitable abrasives include silicas, aluminas, phosphates, carbonates and<br>
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the abrasive agent is a silica selected from:<br>

abrasive agent is selected from the following: calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium<br>
metaphosphate, potassium metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dehydrated dicalcium<br>
phosphate and combinations thereof.<br>
The abrasive polishing material contemplated for use in the compositions of the<br>
present invention can be any material which does not excessively abrade dentin. However,<br>
silica dental abrasives have unique benefits of exceptional dental cleaning and polishing<br>
performance without unduly abrading tooth enamel or dentin.<br>
The silica abrasive polishing materials herein, as well as other abrasives, generally<br>
have an average particle size ranging between about 0.1 to about 30 microns, and preferably<br>
from about 5 to about 15 microns. The abrasive can be precipitated silica or silica gels such<br>
as the silica xerogels described in U.S. Patent No. 3,538,230 to Pader, et al. and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,862,307 to DiGiulio, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Preferred<br><br>
are the silica xerogels marketed under the trade name "Syloid" by the W.R. Grace &amp;<br>
Company, Davison Chemical Division. Also preferred are the precipitated silica materials,<br>
such as those marketed by the J.M. Huber Corporation under the trade name "Zeodent",<br>
particularly the silica carrying the designation "Zeodent 119". The types of silica dental<br>
abrasives useful in the present invention are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,340,583<br>
to Wason, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Silica abrasives described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial Nos. 08/434,147 and 08/434,149, both filed May 2,1995, are also<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, an abrasive is present in amounts from about 0.1 to about 30%<br>
by weight of the oral composition. The abrasive agent may be more typically employed in<br>
amounts from about 0.5 to about 5% by weight of the total composition. The abrasive in the<br>
toothpaste compositions of this invention is generally present at a level of from about 0.5% to<br>
about 10% by weight of the composition. Moreover, inventive chewing gum may contain<br>
from about 1% to about 6% of abrasive, by weight of the oral composition.<br>
The silica used to prepare a chewing gum composition of the present invention is<br>
differentiated by means of its oil absorption value, having oil absorption value of less than<br>
100 cc/100g, and preferably in the range of from 45 cc/100g silica to less than 70 cc/100g<br>
silica. Silica particularly useful in the practice of the present invention is marketed under the<br>
trade designation SYLODENT XWA GRACE Davison Co., Columbia, DS 21044. An<br>
example of such silica is SYLODENT XWA 150, a silica precipitate having a water content<br>
of 4.7% by weight averaging from about 7 to about 11 microns in diameter, having an<br>
Einlehner Hardness of 5, a BET surface area of 390 m.sup.2/g of silica, an oil absorption of<br>
less than 70 cm.sup.3/100g of silica. This silica exhibits low abrasiveness to tooth enamel.<br>
A silica abrasive can be used as the sole abrasive in preparing a chewing gum of the<br>
present invention or in combination with other known abrasives or polishing agents,<br>
including calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium metaphosphate, potassium<br>
metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dehydrated dicalcium phosphate, or other siliceous<br>
materials, or combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the total quantity of abrasive silica present in a chewing gum<br>
composition of the present invention is at a concentration of from about 0.1 to about 20% by<br><br>
weight. Moreover, in some embodiments, the total quantity of abrasive silica present in a<br>
chewing gum composition of the present invention is from about 0.5% to about 5% by<br>
weight.<br>
Orally Acceptable Carrier Composition<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention include an orally acceptable carrier<br>
composition, in an appropriate amount to accommodate the other components of the<br>
formulation. The term "orally acceptable carrier composition" refers to a vehicle capable of<br>
being mixed with the active components for delivery to the oral cavity for tooth whitening<br>
and cleaning purposes, and which will not cause harm to warm-blooded animals, including<br>
humans. The orally acceptable carriers further include those components of the composition<br>
that are capable of being comingled without interaction in a manner which would<br>
substantially reduce the composition's stability and/or efficacy for dental stain-removal in the<br>
oral cavity of warm-blooded animals, including humans, in accordance with the compositions<br>
and methods of the present invention.<br>
The orally acceptable carriers of the present invention can include one or more<br>
compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for<br>
oral administration. The carriers or excipients employed in the present invention may be in<br>
any form appropriate to the mode of delivery, for example, solutions, colloidal dispersions,<br>
emulsions, suspensions, rinses, gels, foams, powders, solids, and the like, and can include<br>
conventional components of toothpastes (including gels), mouthwashes and rinses, mouth<br>
sprays, chewing gums, lozenges, and confectionaries. Carriers suitable for the preparation of<br>
compositions of the present invention are well known in the art. Their selection will depend<br>
on secondary considerations like taste, cost, shelf stability and the like.<br>
Types of additives or ingredients, which may be included in the present compositions include one or more desirable stain-removing agents as provided herein. The inventive<br>
compositions may also include a component selected from the following: elastomers,<br>
elastomer solvents, waxes, emulsifiers, plasticizers, softeners, dispersing agents, sweeteners,<br>
flavorants, humectants, active agents, cooling agents, warming agents, tooth whitening<br>
agents, colorants, bulking agents, fillers and combinations thereof.<br><br>
In some embodiments, an active agent can be a fluoride compound or an antibacterial<br>
compound. For example, a known antibacterial compound is triclosan.<br>
Moreover, in some embodiments a film-forming polymer may be included in the<br>
compositions of the present invention. For example, the film-forming polymer may be a<br>
synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylate (SAPP), such a PVM/MA copolymer (Gantrez<br>
S-97, GAP Corp.). Such polymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,334,375 and<br>
5,505,933, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. SAPP's have<br>
previously been described as being useful for dentin sensitivity reduction. Moreover, SAPP's<br>
have previously been described as antibacteria1-enhancing agents, which enhance delivery of<br>
an antibacterial agent to oral surfaces, and which enhance the retention of the antibacterial<br>
agent on oral surfaces. It is well within the contemplation of the present invention that film-<br>
forming polymers, such as PVM/MA copolymer, may be employed in the compositions of<br>
the present invention as a means of reducing stain formation.<br>
As described above, in some embodiments, the inventive composition may be a gum<br>
composition including a gum base and the encapsulated active.<br>
As described above, in some embodiments, the inventive composition may be a gum<br>
composition including a gum base and the encapsulated active. The gum base may be present<br>
in an amount of about 20 to about 40% by weight of the total composition. It may include<br>
any component known in the chewing gum art. For example, the gum base may include<br>
sweeteners, elastomers, bulking agents, waxes, elastomer solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers,<br>
fillers, mixtures thereof and may include a desirable stain-removing agent(s) as provided<br>
herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may include a suitable sugar bulking agent. For<br>
example, the gum base may include a specific polyol composition including at least one<br>
polyol which is from about 30% to about 80% by weight of the gum base, and desirably from<br>
50% to about 60%. The polyol composition may include any polyol known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to maltitol, sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, isomalt, lactitol<br>
and combinations thereof. Lycasin which is a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate including<br>
sorbitol and maltitol, may also be used.<br><br>
The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation,<br>
natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>
rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay,<br>
and the like, and mixtures thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without<br>
limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
10% to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by<br>
weight.<br>
When a wax is present in the gum base, it softens the polymeric elastomer mixture<br>
and improves the elasticity of the gum base. The waxes employed will have a melting point<br>
below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C. and about 55°C. The low melting<br>
wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the gum base in an amount from<br>
about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about 9.5%, by weight of the gum<br>
base.<br>
In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point may<br>
be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, most petroleum<br>
waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety of<br>
other components, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br><br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art,<br>
for example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl,<br>
glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as<br>
hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
elastomer solvents suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially<br>
hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin,<br>
the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and<br>
the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in amounts from about 2% to about<br>
15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing any immiscible<br>
components into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention include<br>
glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene glycol<br>
monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%,<br>
by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
components, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. 'Waxes, for example, natural<br>
and synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane<br>
waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan<br>
monostearate, tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be<br>
incorporated into the gum base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the<br><br>
gum base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
amounts from about 9% to about 17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean oil<br>
and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers<br>
provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and<br>
softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more<br>
specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous<br>
conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Although softeners may be present to modify the texture of the gum composition, they<br>
may be present in reduced amounts as compared to typical gum compositions. For example,<br>
they may be present from about 0.5 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the<br>
composition, or they may not be present in the composition, since a surfactant active can act<br>
as a softener.<br>
The gum base of this invention may also include effective amounts of bulking agents<br>
such as mineral adjuvants, which may serve as fillers and textural agents. Useful mineral<br>
adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate and the<br>
like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in the gum base<br>
compositions in various amounts. Preferably the amount of filler, when used, will be present<br>
in an amount from about 15% to about 40%, and desirably from about 20% to about 30%, by<br>
weight of the gum base.<br>
A variety of traditional additives may be optionally included in the gum base in<br>
effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and<br>
the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated<br><br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and mixtures<br>
thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to one<br>
having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of making the gum compositions. The manner<br>
in which the gum base components are mixed is not critical and is performed using standard<br>
techniques and apparatus known to those skilled in the art. In a typical method, an elastomer<br>
is admixed with an elastomer solvent and/or a plasticizer and/or an emulsifier and agitated for<br>
a period of from 1 to 30 minutes. The remaining components, such as the low melting point<br>
wax, are then admixed, either in bulk or incrementally, while the gum base mixture is<br>
blended again for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected from,<br>
but not limited to, the following: sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners,<br>
emulsifiers, waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral<br>
adjuvants, flavoring agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings),<br>
antioxidants, acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some<br>
of these additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum<br>
compositions, a sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a<br>
bulking agent.<br>
The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing<br>
gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include<br>
emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in<br>
combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan<br>
gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean, and carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as<br>
malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
fillers, such as those discussed above under the category of mineral adjuvants.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum region may also contain a bulking agent. Suitable<br>
bulking agents may be water-soluble and include sweetening agents selected from, but not<br>
limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, and mixtures<br>
thereof; randomly bonded glucose polymers such as those polymers distributed under the<br><br>
tradename POLYDEXTROSE by Pfizer, Inc., Groton, Conn.; isomalt (a racemic mixture of<br>
alpha-D-glucopyranosy1-l,6-mannitol and alpha-D-glucopyranosy1-l,6-sorbitol manufactured<br>
under the tradename PALATINIT by Suddeutsche Zucker), maltodextrins; hydrogenated<br>
starch hydrolysates; hydrogenated hexoses; hydrogenated disaccharides; minerals, such as<br>
calcium carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide, dicalcium phosphate; celluloses; and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar bulking agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides and<br>
polysaccharides such as xylose, ribulose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, galactose, fructose<br>
(levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, invert sugar, partially hydrolyzed starch and corn syrup<br>
solids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar alcohol bulking agents include sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol,<br>
maltitol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable hydrogenated starch hydrolysates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
25,959, 3,356,811,4,279,931 and various hydrogenated glucose syrups and/or powders<br>
which contain sorbitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are<br>
mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different<br>
saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTAR, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured by Lonza, Inc., of Fairlawn, N.J., are also useful.<br>
The sweetening agents used may be selected from a wide range of materials including<br>
water-soluble sweeteners, water-soluble artificial sweeteners, water-soluble sweeteners<br>
derived from naturally occurring water-soluble sweeteners, dipeptide based sweeteners, and<br>
protein based sweeteners, including mixtures thereof. Without being limited to particular<br>
sweeteners, representative categories and examples include:<br>
(a) water-soluble sweetening agents such as dihydrochalcones, monellin, steviosides,<br>
glycyrrhizin, dihydroflavenol, and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, and L-<br>
aminodicarboxylic acid aminoalkenoic acid ester amides, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br><br>
reacts with the stability limiting component, thereby reducing the stability limiting<br>
component's effect on the active. For example, at least about 90% of the active remains at<br>
about six months in the compositions, and at least about 75% of the active remains at about<br>
one year of shelf-life.<br>
Surfactants<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention include encapsulated tooth whitening<br>
agent(s) as provided herein. For example, the composition may include anionic surfactants<br>
and nonionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. Anionic surfactants useful herein include<br>
medium and long chain fatty acid esters and salts. In some embodiments, the anionic<br>
surfactant is a water-soluble salt of a fatty acid having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms. The salt<br>
may include a metal ion that can be a divalent metal ion or a monovalent metal ion. For<br>
example, the metal ion can be selected from sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable examples of fatty acid salts include salts of stearate and palmitrate. Other<br>
examples include hydroxy fatty acid salts, such as salts of ricinoleic acid, castor oil and ergot<br>
oil. Ricinoleic acid accounts for about 90% of the triglyceride fatty acids of castor oil, and up<br>
to about 40% of the glyceride fatty acids of ergot oil. Other suitable hydroxy fatty acid salts<br>
include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following: lesquerolic acid, densipolic<br>
acid, auricolic acid and P-dimorphecolic acid. Combinations of hydroxy fatty acid salts may<br>
also be employed.<br>
The water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids may be derived from naturally<br>
occurring fatty acids having at least one hydroxyl functionality, such as ricinoleic acid.<br>
Furthermore, the surfactants employed in the present invention or the fatty acids from which<br>
they are derived may be chemically or enzymatically modified so as to contain at least one<br>
hydroxyl functionality.<br>
The fatty acid salts may be derived from fatty acids found, for example, in animals,<br>
plants or bacteria. The polar -COOH group on short-chain fatty acids (e.g., 2-4 carbon<br>
atoms) and even medium-chain (e.g., 6 to 10 carbon atoms) is typically enough to make them<br>
soluble in water. However, as chain length increases (e.g., from 14 to 25 carbons), the fatty<br>
acid type becomes progressively less water soluble and tends to take on oily or fatty<br><br>

The intense sweetening agents may be used in many distinct physical forms wel1-<br>
known in the art to provide an initial burst of sweetness and/or a prolonged sensation of<br>
sweetness. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br><br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Desirably, the sweetener is a high intensity sweetener such as aspartame, sucralose,<br>
and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K).<br>
In general, an effective amount of sweetener may be utilized to provide the level of<br>
sweetness desired, and this amount may vary with the sweetener selected. The amount of<br>
sweetener may be present in amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of the gum<br>
composition, depending upon the sweetener or combination of sweeteners used. The exact<br>
range of amounts for each type of sweetener may be selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
The flavoring agents which may be used include those flavors known to the skilled<br>
artisan, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic<br>
flavor oils and flavoring aromatics and/or oils, oleoresins and extracts derived from plants,<br>
leaves, flowers, fruits, and so forth, and combinations thereof. Nonlimiting representative<br>
flavor oils include spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate),<br>
peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, oil of<br>
nutmeg, allspice, oil of sage, mace, oil of bitter almonds, and cassia oil. Also useful<br>
flavorings are artificial, natural and synthetic fruit flavors such as vanilla, and citrus oils<br>
including lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, and fruit essences including apple, pear, peach,<br>
grape, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, plum, pineapple, apricot and so forth. These flavoring<br>
agents may be used in liquid or solid form and may be used individually or in admixture.<br>
Commonly used flavors include mints such as peppermint, menthol, spearmint, artificial<br>
vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit flavors, whether employed individually or in<br>
admixture.<br>
Other useful flavorings include aldehydes and esters such as cinnamyl acetate,<br>
cinnamaldehyde, citral diethylacetal, dihydrocarvyl acetate, eugenyl formate, p-<br>
methylamisol, and so forth may be used. Generally any flavoring or food additive such as<br>
those described in Chemicals Used in Food Processing, publication 1274, pages 63-258, by<br>
the National Academy of Sciences, may be used. This publication is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br><br>
Further examples of aldehyde flavorings include but are not limited to acetaldehyde<br>

In some embodiments, the flavoring agent may be employed in either liquid form<br>
and/or dried form. When employed in the latter form, suitable drying means such as spray<br>
drying the oil may be used. Alternatively, the flavoring agent may be absorbed onto water<br>
soluble materials, such as cellulose, starch, sugar, maltodextrin, gum arabic and so forth or<br>
may be encapsulated. The actual techniques for preparing such dried forms are wel1-known.<br>
In some embodiments, the flavoring agents may be used in many distinct physical<br>
forms wel1-known in the art to provide an initial burst of flavor and/or a prolonged sensation<br>
of flavor. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of flavoring agent employed herein may be a matter of preference subject<br>
to such factors as the type of final chewing gum composition, the individual flavor, the gum<br>
base employed, and the strength of flavor desired. Thus, the amount of flavoring may be<br>
varied in order to obtain the result desired in the final product and such variations are within<br>
the capabilities of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation. In gum<br>
compositions, the flavoring agent is generally present in amounts from about 0.02% to about<br>
5%, and more specifically from about 0.1% to about 2%, and even more specifically, from<br>
about 0.8% to about 1.8%, by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Coloring agents may be used in amount's effective to produce the desired color. The<br>
coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br><br>
6%, by weight of the gum composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated<br>
in amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the gum<br>
composition. The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food,<br>
drug and cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The<br>
materials acceptable for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative<br>
nonlimiting examples include the indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the<br>
disodium salt of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Green<br>
No.l comprises a triphenylmethane dye and is the monosodium salt of 4-[4-(N-ethy1-p-<br>
sulfoniumbenzylamino)diphenylmemylene]-[1-(N-ethy1-N-p-sulfoniumbenzyl)-delta-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadieneimine]. A full recitation of all F.D.&amp; C. colorants and their corresponding<br>
chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,<br>
3rd Edition, in volume 5 at pages 857-884, which text is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable oils and fats usable in gum compositions include partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable or animal fats, such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef tallow, and lard, among<br>
others. These components when used are generally present in amounts up to about 7%, and<br>
preferably up to about 3.5%, by weight of the gum composition.<br>
Some embodiments may include a method for preparing the gum compositions<br>
including both chewing gum and bubble gum compositions. The chewing gum compositions<br>
may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The apparatus useful in accordance with some embodiments comprises mixing and heating<br>
apparatus well known in the chewing gum manufacturing arts, and therefore the selection of<br>
the specific apparatus will be apparent to the artisan.<br>
In some embodiments, a method of preparing a tooth whitening gum composition<br>
includes encapsulating a tooth whitening active component of the composition within a<br>
reactive barrier coating. The coating includes a hydrophilic material; and a component<br>
reactive with a stability-limiting component in the gum composition. The method also<br>
includes heating a gum base to soften the base and then mixing the softened gum base with<br>
the encapsulated tooth whitening active component so as to obtain a substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture. The method further includes cooling the mixture and forming the<br>
cooled mixture into individual gum pieces. Further components may be mixed into the<br>
softened gum base. For example, one or more of the following may typically be added:<br><br>
bulking agent, filler, humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer,<br>
preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener.<br>
In some embodiments, the method of preparing a tooth whitening gum composition of<br>
the present invention can involve suspending tooth whitening active particles in a fluidized<br>
air stream; and spraying a reactive barrier coating onto the suspended active particles. The<br>
coating includes a hydrophilic material and a component reactive with a stability-limiting<br>
component in the gum. Suitable tooth whitening actives are the same as those described<br>
above. Moreover, suitable hydrophilic materials and reactive components for the barrier<br>
coating are the same as those described above. One or more barrier coating layers may be<br>
sprayed onto the suspended active particles. The coating composition sprayed on the<br>
particles may include any solvent capable of dissolving the water-soluble hydrophilic<br>
material in the coating.<br>
The encapsulated particles of some embodiments may be prepared by any suitable<br>
spray coating method as known in the art. One suitable process is the Wurster process. This<br>
process provides a method for encapsulating individual particulate materials. First the<br>
particles to be encapsulated are suspended in a fluidizing air stream which provides a<br>
generally cyclic flow in front of a spray nozzle. The spray nozzle sprays an atomized flow of<br>
the coating solution.<br>
The atomized barrier coating solution collides with the particles as they are carried<br>
away from the nozzle to provide a particle coating with the coating solution. The temperature<br>
of the fluidizing air stream, which also serves to suspend the particles to be coated, may be<br>
adjusted to evaporate the solvent shortly after the coating solution contacts the particles.<br>
This serves to solidify the coating on the particles, resulting in the desired encapsulated<br>
particle.<br>
This process may be repeated until the desired thickness of the barrier coating is<br>
achieved. Alternatively, the process may be repeated with a different barrier coating solution<br>
to provide different and distinct barrier coating layers in the encapsulated particle<br>
composition.<br><br>
Following the barrier coating process, the particles may then be formed to an<br>
appropriate size as desired, generally from an average particle size range of about 50 µm to<br>
about 800 µm. This may be accomplished by any suitable means such as chopping,<br>
pulverizing, milling or grinding the particles.<br>
In some embodiments, gum pieces may be coated with an aqueous gum coating<br>
composition, which may be applied by any method known in the art. The gum coating<br>
composition may be present in an amount from about 25% to about 35% by weight of the<br>
total gum piece, more specifically about 30% by weight of the gum piece.<br>
The outer gum coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer gum coating<br>
may include sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, isomalt, and other crystallizable polyols; sucrose may<br>
also be used. Flavors may also be added to yield unique product characteristics. Moreover,<br>
the outer gum coating may include one or more of the encapsulated active agents provided<br>
herein.<br>
The gum coating, if present, may include several opaque layers, such that the chewing<br>
gum composition is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be covered<br>
with a further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective purposes.<br>
The outer gum coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. The gum<br>
coating can be further coated with wax. The gum coating may be applied in a conventional<br>
manner by successive applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat.<br>
As the coating dries it usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants<br>
may be added. A polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The gum coating can<br>
further include colored flakes or speckles.<br>
If the composition comprises a gum coating, it is possible that one or more oral care<br>
actives can be dispersed throughout the coating. This may be preferred if one or more oral<br>
care actives is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives.<br>
Moreover, it is well within the contemplation of the present invention that providing one or<br>
more of the stain-removing agents in the gum coating can enhance the stain-removing<br>
efficacy of the total composition.<br><br>
The encapsulated active can be included in one or more of the chewing gum regions<br>
such as the gum coating, the gum base or both. Additionally, the encapsulated active can be<br>
added at different stages of the manufacture, alone or as a premix with other components.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the method for preparing a stain-removing gum<br>
composition includes heating a gum base to soften the base; and mixing the softened gum<br>
base with at least one of the following: elastomer, wax, emulsifier, bulking agent, filler,<br>
humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer, preservative, warming<br>
agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener to obtain a substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture. The method also involves cooling the mixture; forming the cooled<br>
mixture into individual gum pieces; and coating the gum pieces with a gum coating solution<br>
including the encapsulated active. The hydroxy fatty acid salt may be a salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
One or more other components may be included in the gum coating, such as including, but<br>
not limited to, the following: gum arabic, flavorant, colorant, sweetener, bulking agent, filler,<br>
anti-adherent compound, dispersing agent, moisture absorbing compound, warming agent,<br>
cooling agent and film-forming agent.<br>
The gum coating may be formulated to assist with increasing the thermal stability of<br>
the gum piece and preventing leaking of a liquid fill if the gum product is a center-filled gum.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum coating may include a gelatin composition. The gelatin<br>
composition may be added as a 40% by weight solution and may be present in the gum<br>
coating composition from about 5% to about 10% by weight of the gum coating composition,<br>
and more specifically about 7% to about 8%. The gel strength of the gelatin may be from<br>
about 130 bloom to about 250 bloom.<br>
Additives, such as physiological cooling agents, throat-soothing agents, spices,<br>
warming agents, tooth-whitening agents, breath-freshening agents, vitamins minerals,<br>
caffeine, drugs and other actives may be included in any or all portions of the chewing gum<br>
composition. Such components may be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their intended<br>
effects.<br>
With respect to cooling agents, a variety of well known cooling agents may be<br>
employed. For example, among the useful cooling agents are included menthol, xylitol,<br>
menthane, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthyl salicylate, N,2,3-trimethy1-2-isopropyl<br>
butanamide (WS-23), N-ethy1-p-menthane-3-carboxamide (WS-3), menthyl succinate, 3,1-<br><br>
menthoxypropane 1,2-diol, among others. These and other suitable cooling agents are further<br>
described in the following U.S. patents, all of which are incorporated in their entirety by<br>
reference hereto: U.S. 4,230,688 and 4,032,661 to Rowsell et al.; 4,459,425 to Amano et al.;<br>
4,136,163 to Watson et al.; and 5,266,592 to Grub et al. These cooling agents may be<br>
present in one or more of the outer gum coatings, the gum region surrounding the liquid fill,<br>
the liquid fill per se, or in any combination of those three gum areas. Cooling agents, when<br>
used in the outer coating composition for the gum, are generally present in amount of 0.01%<br>
to about 1.0%. When used in the other portions of the gum, such as the gum region or the<br>
center fill, they may be present in amounts of about 0.001 to about 10% by weight of the total<br>
chewing gum piece.<br>
Warming components may be selected from a wide variety of compounds known to<br>
provide the sensory signal of warming to the user. These compounds offer the perceived<br>
sensation of warmth, particularly in the oral cavity, and often enhance the perception of<br>
flavors, sweeteners and other organoleptic components. Among the useful warming<br>
compounds included are vanillyl alcohol n-butylether (TK-1000) supplied by Takasago<br>
Perfumary Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan, vanillyl alcohol n-propylether, vanillyl alcohol<br>
isopropylether, vanillyl alcohol isobutylether, vanillyl alcohol n-aminoether, vanillyl alcohol<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
STABLE TOOTH WHITENING GUM WITH REACTIVE INGREDIENTS<br>
The invention relates to an oral composition having an increased shelf life<br>
comprising: (a) a carrier composition comprising a first reactive component such as herein<br>
described; and (b) an active composition comprising an active component such as herein<br>
described encapsulated in a coating, said coating comprising: (i) a physical barrier coating<br>
comprising a hydrophilic material such as herein described; and (ii) a reactive barrier coating<br>
comprising a hydrophilic material and a second reactive component such as herein described,<br>
characterized in that the said coating provides an interaction of the first and second reactive<br>
components, wherein said interaction prevents a degradation of the active component by<br>
controlling the pH of the first reactive component and provides an increased shelf life of the<br>
oral composition.</td>
