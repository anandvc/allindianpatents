Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and the use of these compounds or compositions for treating hyper-proliferative and angiogenesis disorders, as a sole agent or in combination with other active ingredients, e.g., cytotoxic therapies.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Activation of the ras signal transduction pathway indicates a cascade of events that have a profound impact on cellular proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. Raf kinase, a downstream effector of ras, is recognized as a key mediator of these signals from cell surface receptors to the cell nucleus (Lowy, D. R.; Willumsen, B. M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1993, 62, 851; Bos, J. L. Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 4682). It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of active ras by inhibiting the raf kinase signaling pathway by administration of deactivating antibodies to raf kinase or by co-expression of dominant negative raf kinase or dominant negative i\4EK, the substrate of raf kinase, leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the normal growth phenotype (see: Daum et al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994, 19, 474-80; Fridman et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 30105-8. Kolch et al. [Nature 1991, 349, 426-28) have further indicated that inhibition of raf expression by antisense RNA blocks cell proliferation in membrane-associated oncogenes, Similarly, inhibition of raf kinase (by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides) has been correlated in vitro and in vivo with inhibition of the growth of a variety of human tumor types (Monia et al., Nat. Med. 1996, 2, 668-75). Some examples of small<br>
ule inhibitors of Raf kinase activity are important agents for the treatment of cancer. (Naumann, U.; Eisenmann-Tappe, [.; Rapp, U. R. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1997, 143, 237; Monia, B. P.; Johnston, J. F,; Geiger, T.; Muiier, M.; Fabbro, D. Nature Medicine 1996, 2,668).<br>
To support progressive tumor growth beyond the size of 1-2 mm3, it is recognized that tumor cells require a functional stroma, a support structure consisting of fibroblast, smooth muscle cells, endotheiial cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and soluble factors (Folkman, J., Semin Oncol, 2002. 29(6 Suppl 16), 15-8). Tumors induce the formation of stromal tissues through the secretion of soluble growth factors such as PDGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which in turn stimulate the secretion of complimentary factors by host cells such as fibrobfast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endotheliaf growth factor (VEGF). These stimulatory factors induce the formation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the tumor and allows it to grow and provides a route for metastasis. It is believed some therapies directed at inhibiting stroma formation will inhibit the growth of epithelial tumors from a wide variety of histological types. (George, D. Semin Oncoi&gt; 2001. 26(5 Supp! 17), 27-33; Shaheen, R.M., et at., Cancer Res, 2001. 61(4), 1464-8; Shaheen, R.M., et al. Cancer Res, 1999. 59(21), 5412-6). However, because of the complex nature and the multiple growth factors involved in angiogenesis process and tumor progression, an agent targeting a single pathway may have limited efficacy. It is desirable to provide treatment against a number of key signaling pathways utilized by tumors to induce angiogenesis in the host stroma. These include PDGF, a potent stimulator of stroma formation (Ostman, A. and C.H. Heldin, Adv Cancer Res, 2001, 80, 1-38), FGF, a chemo-attractant and mitogen for fibrobiasts and endothelia! ceils, and VEGF, a potent regulator of vascularization.<br>
PDGF is another key regulator of stromal formation which is secreted by many tumors in a paracrine fashion and is believed to promote the growth of fibrobiasts, smooth muscle and endothelia! cells, promoting stroma formation and angiogenesis, PDGF was originally identified as the v-sis oncogens product of the simian sarcoma<br>
virus (Heldin, C.H., et al., J Cell Sci Suppl, 1985, 3, 65-76). The growth factor is made up of two peptide chains, referred to as A or B chains which share 60% homology in their primary amino acid sequence. The chains are disulfide cross linked to form the 30 kDa mature protein composed of either AA, 3B or AB homo- or heterodimmers, PDGF is found at high levels in platelets, and is expressed by endotheliai cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, the production of PDGF is up regulated under low oxygen   conditions   such   as   those   found   in   poorly  vascularized   tumor  tissue {Kourembanas, S., et al., Kidney Int, 1997, 51(2), 438-43). PDGF binds with high affinity to the PDGF receptor, a 1106'amino acid 124 kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (Heidin, C.H., A. Ostman, and L, Ronnstrand, Biochrm Biophys Acta, 1998. 1378(1), 79-113). PDGFR is found as homo- or heterodimer chains which have 30% homology overall in their amino acid sequence and 64% homology between -their kinase domains (Heldin, C.H., et al.. Embo J, 1988, 7(5), 1387-93). PDGFR is a member of a family of tyrosine kinase receptors with split kinase domains that includes VEGFR2 (KDR). VEGFR3 fFI!4). c-Kit, and FLT3. The PDGF receptor is expressed primarily on fibroblast, smooth muscfe cells, and pericytes and to a lesser extent on neurons, kidney mesangial, Leydig, and Schwann cells of the central nervous system. Upon binding to the receptor, PDGF induces receptor dimerization and undergoes auto- and trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues which increase the receptors' kinase activity and promotes the recruitment of downstream effectors through the activation of SH2 protein binding domains. A number of signaling molecules form complexes with activated PDGFR  including   PI-3-kinase,  phospholipase  C-gamma,  src  and  GAP  (GTPase activating protein for p21-ras) (Soskic, V., et al. Biochemistry, 1999, 38(6), 1757-64). Through the activation of PI-3-kinase, PDGF activates the Rho signaling pathway inducing cell motility and migration, and through the activation of GAP,  induces mitogenesis through the activation of p21-ras and the MAPK signaling pathway.<br>
In adults, it is believed the major function of PDGF is to faciiitate and increase the rate of wound healing and to maintain blood vessel homeostasis (Baker, E.A. and D. J. Leaper, Wound Repair Regen, 2000. 8(5), 392-8; Yu, J., A. Moon, and H.R, Kim,<br>
Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2001. 282(3), 697-700). PDGF is found at high concentrations in platelets and is a potent chemoattractant for fibroblast, smooth muscle cells, neutrophils and macrophages. In addition to its role in wound healing PDGF is known to help maintain vascular homeostasis. During the development of new blood vessels, PDGF recruits pericytes and smooth muscle cells that are needed for the structural integrity of the vessels. PDGF is thought to play a similar role during tumor neovascularization. As part of its role in angiogenesis PDGF controls interstitial fluid pressure, regulating the permeability of vessels through its regulation of the interaction between connective tissue cells-and the extracellular matrix. Inhibiting PDGFR activity can lower interstitial pressure and facilitate the influx of cytotoxics into tumors improving the anti-tumor efficacy of these agents (Pietras, K., et al. Cancer Res, 2002. 62(19), 5476-84; Pietras, K., et al. Cancer Res, 2001. 61(7), 2929-34).<br>
PDGF can promote tumor growth through either the paracrine or autocrine stimulation of PDGFR receptors on stromal cells or tumor cells directly, or through the amplification of the receptor or activation of the receptor by recombination. Over expressed PDGF can transform human melanoma cells and keratinocytes (Forsberg, K., et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A., 1993. 90(2), 393-7; Skobe, M. and N.E. Fusenig, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1998. 95(3), 1050-5), two cell types that do not express PDGF receptors, presumably by the direct effect of PDGF on stroma formation and induction of angiogenesis. This paracrine stimulation of tumor stroma is also observed in carcinomas of the colon, lung, breast, and prostate (Bhardwaj, B., et al. din Cancer Res, 1996, 2(4), 773-82; Nakanishi, K., et al. Mod Pathol, 1997, 10(4), 341-7; Sundberg, C., et al. Am J Pathol, 1997, 151(2), 479-92; Lindmark, G., et al. Lab Invest, 1993, 69(6), 682-9; Vignaud, J.M., et al, Cancer Res, 1994, 54(20), 5455-63) where the tumors express PDGF, but not the receptor. The autocrine stimulation of tumor cell growth, where a large faction of tumors analyzed express both the ligand PDGF and the receptor, has been reported in glioblastomas (Fleming, T.P.;' et al. Cancer Res, 1992, 52(16), 4550-3), soft tissue sarcomas (Wang, J., M.D. Coltrera, and A.M. Gown, Cancer Res, 1994, 54(2), 560-4) and cancers of the ovary (Henriksen, R., et al. Cancer Res,<br>
1993,	53(19), 4550-4), prostate (Fudge, K., C.Y. Wang, and M.E. Stearns, Mod Pathol,<br>
1994,	7(5), 549-54), pancreas (Funa, K., et al. Cancer Res, 1990, 50(3), 748-53) and<br>
lung (Antoniades, H.N., et al., Proc NailAcad Sci USA, 1992, 89(9), 3942-6). Ligand<br>
independent activation of the receptor is found to a lesser extent but has been reported<br>
in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) where the a chromosomal translocation<br>
event forms a fusion protein between the Ets-like transcription factor TEL and the PDGF<br>
receptor. In addition, activating mutations in PDGFR have been found in gastrointestinal<br>
stromal tumors in which c-Kit activation is not involved (Heinrich, M.C., et al., Science,<br>
2003, 9, 9).<br>
Certain  PDGFR inhibitors will  interfere with tumor stromal development and are believed to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.<br>
Another major regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in both embryonic development and some angiogenic-dependent diseases is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also called vascular permeability factor, VPF). VEGF represents a family of isoforms of mitogens existing in homodimeric forms due to alternative RNA splicing. The VEGF isoforms are reported to be highly specific for vascular endothelial cells (for reviews, see: Farrara et al. Endocr. Rev. 1992, 13, 18; Neufield et al. FASEB J. 1999, 13, 9).<br>
VEGF expression is reported to be induced by hypoxia (Shweiki et al. Nature 1992, 359, 843), as well as by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor. To date, VEGF and the VEGF family members have been reported to bind to one or more of three transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (Mustonen et al. J. Cell Biol., 1995, 129, 895), VEGF receptor-1 (also known as flt-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)), VEGFR-2 (also known as kinase insert domain containing receptor (KDR); the murine analogue of KDR is known as fetal liver kinase-1 (flk-1)), and VEGFR-3 (also known as flt-4). KDR and flt-1 have been shown to have different signal transduction properties (Waltenberger et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 26988); Park et al. Oncogene 1995, 10,<br>
135). Thus, KDR undergoes strong ligand-dependant tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells, whereas flt-1 displays a weak response. Thus, binding to KDR is believed to be a critical requirement for induction of the full spectrum of VEGF-mediated biological responses.<br>
In vivo, VEGF plays a central role in vasculogenesis, and induces angiogenesis and permeabilization of blood vessels. Deregulated VEGF expression contributes to the development of a number of diseases that are characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes. It is believed regulation of the VEGF-mediated signal transduction cascade by some agents can provide a useful mode for control of abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an important prerequisite for growth of tumors beyond about 1-2 mm. Oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to cells in tumor smaller than this limit through diffusion.   However, it is believed every tumor is dependent on angiogenesis for continued growth after it has reached a certain size. Tumorigenic cells within hypoxic regions of tumors respond by stimulation of VEGF production, which triggers activation of quiescent endothelial cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation. (Shweiki et al. Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., 1995, 92, 768).  In addition, VEGF production in tumor regions where there is no angiogenesis may proceed through the ras signal transduction pathway (Grugel et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 25915; Rak et al. Cancer Res, 1995, 55, 4575).   In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated VEGF mRNA is strongly upregulated in a wide variety of human tumors, including lung (Mattern et al. Br. J. Cancer 1996, 73, 931), thyroid (Viglietto et al. Oncogens 1995, 11, 1569), breast (Brown et al. Human Pathol. 1995, 26, 86), gastrointestional tract (Brown et al. Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 4727; Suzuki et al.   Cancer Res. 1996, 56, 3004), kidney and bladder (Brown et al. Am. J. Pathol. 1993, 1431, 1255), ovary (Olson et al. Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 1255), and cervical (Guidi et al. J. Nat'l Cancer Inst. 1995, 87, 12137) carcinomas, as well as angiosacroma (Hashimoto et al. Lab. Invest. 1995, 73, 859) and several intracranial tumors (Plate et al. A/aft/re 1992, 359, 845; Phillips et al. Int. J. Oncol. 1993,<br>
2, 913; Berkman et al. J. Clin. invest, 1993, 9f, 153). Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to KDR have been shown to be efficacious in blocking tumor angiogenesis (Kim et al. Nature 1993, 362, 841; Rockwell et al. Mo/. Cell. Differ. 1995, 3, 315).<br>
Overexpression of VEGF, for example under conditions of extreme hypoxia, can lead to intraocular angiogenesis, resulting in hyperproliferation of blood vessels, leading eventually to blindness. Such a cascade of events has been observed for a number of retinopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, ischemic retinal-vein occlusion, and retinopathy of prematurity (Aiello-et al. New Engl. J. Med. 1994, 331, 1480; Peer et al. Lab. Invest 1995, 72, 638), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see, Lopez et al. Invest. Opththalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996, 37, 855).<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the in-growth of vascular pannus may be mediated by production of angiogenic factors. Levels of immunoreactive VEGF are hig'h in the synovial fluid of RA patients, while VEGF levels were low in the synovial fluid of patients with other forms of arthritis of with degenerative joint disease (Koch et al. J. Immunol. 1994, 152, 4149). The angiogenesis inhibitor AGM-170 has been shown to prevent neovascularization of the joint in the rat collagen arthritis model (Peacock et al. J. Exper. Med. 1992, 775, 1135).<br>
Increased VEGF expression has also been shown in psoriatic skin, as well as bullous disorders associated with subepidermal blister formation, such as bullous pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis herpetiformis (Brown et al. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995, 104,744).<br>
The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF, VEGF-C, VEGF-D) and their receptors (VEGFR2, VEGFR3) are not only key regulators of tumor angiogenesis, but also lymphangiogenesis. VEGF, VEGF-C and VEGF-D are expressed in most tumors, primarily during periods of tumor growth and, often at substantially increased levels. VEGF expression is stimulated by hypoxia, cytokines, oncogenes such as ras, or by<br><br>
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (McMahon, G. Oncologist 2000, 5(Suppl. 1), 3-10; McDonald, N.Q.; Hendrickson, W.A. Ce//1993, 73, 421-424).<br>
The biological activities of the VEGFs are mediated through binding to their receptors. VEGFR3  (also  called   Flt-4)  is  predominantly expressed  on  lymphatic endothelium in normal adult tissues.   VEGFR3 function is needed for new lymphatic vessel formation, but not for maintenance of the pre-existing lymphatics.   VEGFR3 is also upregulated on blood vessel endothelium in tumors. Recently VEGF-C and VEGF-D, ligands for VEGFR3, have been identified as regulators of lymphangiogenesis in mammals. Lymphangiogenesis induced by tumor-associated lymphangiogenic factors could promote the growth of new vessels into the tumor, providing tumor cells access to systemic circulation. Cells that invade the lymphatics could find their way into the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. Tumor expression studies have allowed a direct comparison of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR3 expression with clinicopathoiogical factors that relate directly to the ability of primary tumors to spread (e.g., lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, secondary metastases, and disease-free survival). In many instances, these studies demonstrate a statistical correlation between the expression of lymphangiogenic factors and the ability of a primary solid tumor to metastasize (Skobe, M. et al. Nature Med. 2001, 7(2), 192-198; Stacker, S.A. et aL Nature Med. 2001, 7(2), 186-191; Makinen, T. et al. Nature Med. 2001, 7(2), 199-205; Mandriota, S.J. et al. EMBO J. 2001, 20(4), 672-82; Karpanen, T. et al. Cancer Res. 2001, 61(5), 1786-90; Kubo, H. et al. Blood 2000, 96(2), 546-53).<br>
Hypoxia appears to be an important stimulus for VEGF production in malignant cells. Activation of p38 MAP kinase is required for VEGF induction by tumor cells in response to hypoxia (Blaschke, F. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002, 296, 890-896; Shemirani, B. et al. Oral Oncology 2002, 38, 251-257). In addition to its involvement in angiogenesis through regulation of VEGF secretion, p38 MAP kinase promotes malignant cell invasion, and migration of different tumor types through regulation of collagenase activity and urokinase plasminogen activator expression<br>
(Laferriere, J. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 33762-33772; Westermarck, J. et al. Cancer Res. 2000, 60, 7156-7162; Huang, S. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 12266-12272; Simon, C. et al. Exp. Cell Res. 2001, 277, 344-355).<br>
Some diarylureas have been described as having activity as serine-threonine kinase and/or as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ultility of these diarylureas as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of cancer, angiogenesis disorders, and inflammatory disorders has been demonstated.

The term "5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring, containing at least one atom selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, which is saturated, partially saturated, or aromatic" includes, by no way of limitation, tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperazine, piperidine, piperidinone, tetrahydropyrimidone, pentamethyiene sulfide, tetramethylene sulfide, dihydropyrane, dihydrofuran, dihydrothiophene, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, pyrazole, thiazole, oxazole, isoxazole, isothiazole, triazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazine, triazine, and the like.<br>
The term "C1-3 alkyl-phenyl" includes, for example, 2-methylphenyl, isopropylphenyl, 3-phenylpropyl, or 2-phenyl-1-methylethyl. Substituted examples include 2-[2-chlorophenyl]ethyl, 3,4-dimethylphenylmethyl, and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the term "aryl" includes 6-12 membered mono or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups (e.g., phenyl, naphthalene, azulene, indene group ) having 0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 substituents.<br>
The compounds of Formula (1) may contain one or more asymmetric centers, depending upon the location and nature of the various substituents desired. Asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the {R) or (S) configuration or (R,S) configuration. In certain instances, asymmetry may also be present due to restricted rotation about a given bond, for example, the central bond adjoining two substituted aromatic rings of the specified compounds. Substituents on a ring may also be present in either cis or trans form. It is intended that all such configurations (including enantiomers and diastereomers), are included within the scope of the present invention. Preferred compounds are those- with the absolute configuration of the compound of Formula (I) which produces the more desirabfe biological activity. Separated, pure or partially purified isomers or racemic mixtures of the compounds of this invention are also included within the scope of the present invention. The purification of said isomers and the separation of said isomeric mixtures can be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoi'someric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covaient diastereomers. Examples  of  appropriate  acids   are   tartaric,   diacetyltartaric,  ditoluoyitartaric   and camphorsulfonic  acid.  Mixtures of diastereoisomers  can  be separated   into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known in the art, for example, by chrornatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then (iberated from the separated diastereomeric salts.   A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chirai chrornatography (e.g., chira! HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chirai HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of Formula I can likewise be obtained by chirai syntheses utilizing opticafly active starting materials.<br>
The present invention also relates to useful forms of the compounds as disclosed herein, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, metabolites and prodrugs of all the compounds Formula (I). The term "pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt" refers to a relatively non-toxic, inorganic or organic acid addition salt of a compound of the present invention. For example, see S. M. Berge, et a/, "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Pharm. Sci 1977, 66, 1-19. Pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts include those obtained by reacting the main compound, functioning as a base, with an inorganic or organic acid to form a salt, for example, salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succintc acid and citric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include those in which the main compound functions as an acid and is reacted with an-appropriate base to form, e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, mangnesium, ammonium, and choline salts. Those skilled in the art will further recognize that acid addition salts of the claimed compounds may be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate inorganic or organic acid via any of a number of known methods. Alternatively, alkali and alkaline earth metal saits are prepared by reacting the compounds of the invention with the appropriate base via a variety of known methods.<br>

Certain pharmacologically active agents can be further modified with labile functional groups that are cleaved after in vivo administration to furnish the parent active agent and the pharmacologically inactive derivatizing group, These derivatives, commonly referred to as prodrugs, can be used, for example, to alter the physicochemical properties of the active agent, to target the active agent to a specific tissue, to alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the active agent, and to reduce undesirable side effects, Prodrugs of the invention include, e.g., the esters of appropriate compounds of this invention that are well-tolerated, pharmaceutically acceptable esters such as alkyl esters including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl or pentyl esters. Additional esters such as phenyl-C1-C5 alkyl may be used, although methy! ester is preferred.<br>

General Preparative Methods<br>
The particular process to be utilized in the preparation of the compounds used in this embodiment of the invention depends upon the specific compound desired. Such factors as the selection of the specific substituents play a role in the path to be followed in the preparation of the specific compounds of this invention. Those factors are readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures. Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are presented to aid the reader in synthesizing the compounds of the present invention, with more detailed particular examples being presented below in the experimental section describing the working examples.<br>
All variable groups of these methods are as described in the generic description if they are not specifically defined below. When a variable group or substituent with a given symbol is used more than- once in a given structure, it is to be understood that each of these groups or substituents may be independently varied within the range of definitions for that symbol. It is recognized that compounds of the invention with each claimed optional functional group cannot be prepared with each of the below-listed methods. Within the scope of each method optional substituents are used which are stable to the reaction conditions, or the functional groups which may participate in the reactions are present in protected form where necessary, and the removal of such protective groups is completed at appropriate stages by methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be made according to conventional chemical methods, and/or as disclosed below, from starting materials which are either commercially available or producible according to routine, conventional chemical methods. General methods for the preparation of the compounds, are given below, and the preparation of representative compounds is specifically illustrated in exampfes.<br>
General Methods<br>
Reaction Scheme 1: Synthesis of Ureas of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)Aryl amines of formulas (III) or (V) are commercially available, or can be synthesized according to Method A or B, or methods commonly known to those skilled in the art. Aryl amines are commonly synthesized by reduction of nitroaryls using a metal catalyst, such as Ni, Pd, or Pt, and H2 or a hydride transfer agent, such as formate, cyclohexadiene, or a borohydride (Rylander. Hydrogenation Methods; Academic Press: London, UK (1985)). Nitroaryls may also be directly reduced using a strong hydride source, such as LiAlH4 (Seyden-Penne. Reductions by the Alumina- and horohydrides in Organic Synthesis; VCH Publishers: New York (1991)), or using a zero valent metal, such as Fe, Sn or Ca, often in acidic media. Many methods exist for the synthesis of nitroaryis (March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.; John Wiley: New York (1985). Larock. Comprehensive Organic Transformations; VCH Publishers: New York (1989)). Nitro aryls are commonly formed by electrophilic aromatic nitration using HNO3, or an alternative NO2+ source.<br>
For the synthesis of compounds of formula (II) where L represents -O- or • -S-, and B, R2 and m are broadly defined as above, the nitroaryls are further elaborated prior to reduction. In Reaction Scheme 2 - method D, nitro aryls substituted with potential leaving groups such as F or Cl undergo substitution reactions on treatment with nucleophiles, such as phenoxide or thiolate, under basic conditions.<br>
Another method for the preparation of the intermediate of Formula (II) is depicted in. Reaction Scheme 2 - Method C. The condensation of amine (V) with an appropriate substituted choropyridine has been previously described in the patent literatures, and can be adapted to the compounds of the present invention. For example, PCT Int. AppL, WO 99 32111, Dumas, J. et al., "Method for the Treatment of Neoplasm by inhibition of raf Kinase using N-Heteroaryl-N'-(hetero)arylureas", PCT Int. AppL, WO 99 32110, Dumas, J., et al., "Inhibition of raf Kinase using Aryl- and Heteroaryl- Substituted Heterocyclic Ureas",<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be prepared from compounds of formula (VII) according to the reaction sequence shown in the General Methods G and H above. Using Method G, ureas of Formula (VI) are treated with a lewis acid such as magnesium chloride and the appropriate substituted amines, in a solvent such as THF<br>
at room temperature, to provide substituted amides. In Method H, ureas of Formula (VI) are deesterified with a base such as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, Carboxylic acids of formula (VII) are coupled with the appropriate amines according to methods commonly known to those skilled in the art [e.g. from treatment of a carboxylic acid with DCC/DMAP or EDC!/ HOST], in a solvent such as THF, AcCN, or DMF. In addition, compounds of formula (I) where R4 and R5 are hydrogens may be synthesized according to the reaction scheme shown in Method I. The cyano compound (VIII) can be hydrolyzed in the presence of NaOH or sodium percarbonate, in aqueous solvent such as acetone-water, and at temperature from 20 to 100°C. Compounds of formula (VI) and (VIII) are synthesized according to methods A to F, or methods commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Pyridine-1 -oxides or Formula (I) where the pyridine ririg carries a hydroxy substituent on its nitrogen atom, and-A, 8, L are broadly defined as above can be prepared from the corresponding pyridines using oxidation conditions know in the art. Some examples are as follows:<br>
•	peracids such as meta chloroperbenzoic acids in chlorinated solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or chloroform (Markgraf et al,, Tetrahedron 1991,<br>
47,183);<br>

The parenteral compositions of this invention will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) preferably of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulation preferably ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Diluents and solvents that may be employed are, for example, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solutions and isotonic glucose solutions. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. For this purpose, any bland, fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
A composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritation excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such material are, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs<br>
transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, incorporated herein by reference). Such patches may be constructed for continuous,- pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Controlled release formulations for parenteral administration include liposomal, polymeric microsphere and polymeric gel formulations which are known in the art.<br>
It may be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the patient via a mechanical delivery device. The construction and use of mechanical delivery devices for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. Direct techniques for, for example, administering a drug directly to the brain usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the patient's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system, used for the transport of agents to specific anatomical regions of the body, is described in US Patent No. 5,011,472, issued April 30, 1991.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also contain other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable compounding ingredients, generally referred to as carriers or diluents, as necessary or desired. Conventional procedures for preparing such composition's in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized.

A unit dosage may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 1500 mg of active ingredient, and can be administered for example, one or more times per day.   In some cases every other day or weekly administration is suitable. Clinically useful dosing schedules will range from three times a day dosing to once every four weeks dosing. In addition, "drug holidays" in which a patient is not dosed with a drug for a certain period of time, may be beneficial to the overall balance between pharmacological effect and tolerability. The average daily dosage for administration by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, and use of infusion techniques will preferably be from about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily rectal dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily vaginal dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.1 to 200 mg administered between one to four times daily. The transdermal concentration will preferably be that required to maintain an average daily dose of from about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg, The average daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of total body weight.<br>
The specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary<br>
according to the nature and severity of the condition as determined by the attending diagnostician, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age and general condition of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion of the drug, drug combinations, and the like. The desired mode of treatment and number of doses of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt or ester or composition thereof can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests.<br>

For IC50 generation for both PDGFR and Flk-1, compounds were added prior to the enzyme initiation. A 50-fold stock plate was made with compounds serially diluted 1:3 in a 50% DMSO/50% dH2O solution. A 2 µL. addition of the stock to the assay gave final compound concentrations ranging from 10 µM - 4.56 nM in 1% DMSO. The data were expressed as percent inhibition: % inhibition = 100-((Signal with inhibitor-background)/(Signal without inhibitor - background)) * 100<br>
pPDGFR-b sandwich ELISA in AoSMC cells<br>
100K P3-P6 Aortic SMC were plated in each well of 12-well cluster in 1000 pi. volume/ well of SGM-2 using standard cell culture techniques. Next day, cells were rinsed with 1000 pL D-PBS once, then serum starved in 500 pL SBM (smooth muscle cell basal media) with 0,1% BSA overnight. Compounds were diluted at a dose range from (10 \M to 1 nM in 10-fold dilution steps in DMSO, final DMSO concentration 0.1%). Remove old media by inversion into the sink quickiy then add 100 µl of each dilution to corresponding well of cells for 1 hr at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with 10 ng/mL PDGF BB ligand for 7 minutes at 37 °C. The media is decanted and 150 pL of isotonic lysis buffer with protease inhibitor tablet (Complete; EDTA-free) and 0.2 mM Na vanadate is added. Cells are lysed for 15 min at 4 °C on shaker in cold room. Lysates are put in eppendorf tubes to which 15 µL. of agarose-conjugated anti-PDGFR-b<br>
antibody is added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Next day, beads are rinsed in 50-volumes of PBS three times and boiled in 1x IDS sample buffer for 5 minutes. Samples were run on 3-8% gradient Tris-Acetate gels and transferred onto Nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 1% BSA/TBS-T for 1 hr. before incubation in anti-phospho-PDGFR-b (Tyr-857) antibody in blocking buffer (1:1000 dilution) for 1 hour. After three washes in TBS-T, membranes were incubated in Goat anti-rabbit HRP IgG (1:25000 dilution) for 1 hr. Three more washes followed before addition of ECL substrate. Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL. Subsequently, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-PDGFR-b antibody for total PDGFR-b.<br>
c-Raf (Raf-1.) Biochemical Assay<br>
Purification of proteins used in the assay<br>
The c-Raf biochemical assay was performed with a c-Raf enzyme that was activated (phosphorylated) by Lck kinase. Lck-activated c-Raf (Lck/c-Raf) was produced in Sf9 insect cells by co-infecting cells with baculoviruses expressing, under the control of the polyhedrin promoter, GST-c-Raf (from amino acid 302 to amino acid 648) and Lck (full-length). Both baculoviruses were used at the multiplicity of infection of 2.5 and the cells were harvested 48 hours post infection.<br>
MEK-1 protein was produced in Sf9 insect cells by infecting cells with the baculovirus expressing GST-MEK-1 (full-length) fusion protein at the multiplicity of infection of 5 and harvesting the cells 48 hours post infection. Similar purification procedure was used for GST-c-Raf 302-648 and GST-MEK-1.<br>
Transfected cells were suspended at 100 mg of wet cell biomass per ml in a buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM sodium chloride pH 7.3, 0.5% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were disrupted with Poiytron<br>
homogenizer and centrifuged 30,000g for 30 minutes, The 30,000g supernatant was applied onto GSH-Sepharose. The resin was washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 150 mM NaCI and 0.01% Triton X-100. The GST-tagged proteins were eluted with a solution containing 100 mM Glutathione, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCI and 0.01% Triton X-100. The purified proteins were dialyzed' into a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,150 mM NaCI and 20% Glycerol.<br>
BiochemicaLassay protocol and results,<br>
The compounds were serially diluted in DMSO using three-fold dilutions to stock concentrations ranging typically from 50 µM to 20 nM (final concentrations in the assay range from 1 µM to 0.4 nM). The c-Raf biochemical assay was performed as a radioactive filtermat assay in 96-well Costar polypropylene plates (Costar 3365). The plates were loaded with 75 µL solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 70 mM NaCI, 80 ng of Lck/c-Raf and 1 µg MEK-1. Subsequently, 2 µL of the serially diluted individual compounds were added to the reaction, prior to the addition of ATP. The reaction was initiated with 25 (xL ATP solution containing 5 µM ATP and 0.3 µCi [33P]-ATP. The plates were sealed and incubated at 32 °C for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 50 µl of 4 % Phosphoric Acid and harvested onto P30 filtermats (PerkinElmer) using a Wallac Tomtec Harvester. Filtermats were washed with 1 % Phosphoric Acid first and deinonized H2O second. The filters were dried in a microwave, soaked in scintillation fluid and read in a Wallac 1205 Betaplate Counter (Wallac Inc., Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.). The results were expressed as percent inhibition.<br>
% Inhibition = [100-(Tib/TO] x 100 where.<br>
Tib - (counts per minute with inhibitor)-(background) TI = (counts per minute without inhibitor)-(background)<br>
