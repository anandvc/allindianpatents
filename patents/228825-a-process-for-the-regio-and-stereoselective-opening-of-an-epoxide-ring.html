PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF (+)-P-MENTHA-2,8^DIENE-l-OL FIELD OF THE INTENTION<br>
The present relation relates to a process for regio- and stereoselective opening of an epoxide ring, and more particularly to the regio- and stereoselective conversion of (+)-limonene oxide to (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Epoxides, also known as oxiranes, are useful intermediates in synthesizing active phannaceutical ingredients and drugs. The inherent polarity and strain of the three-membered ring makes them susceptible to reaction with a large number of reagents. Of particular interest is the stereoselective nucleophilic attack of the epoxide ring to form 1,2-di-substituted products.<br>
A9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is one of the biologically active components of cannabis. Phannaceutical interest in THC has increased due to FDA approval for several therapeutic applications. Many of the known processes for the preparation of THC utilize (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol or an analog thereof as an intermediate. The (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol or an analog can be prepared from limonene through a synthesis that includes opening an epoxy ring. Conventional methods for converting limonene into (+)-p-mentha-2?8-diene-l-ol include oxidizing limonene with singlet oxygen and conversion using an enzymatic reaction.<br>
Previous methods to synthesize (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol present certain drawbacks when attempts are made to produce on a commercial scale. Many of these methods result in the formation of significant isomeric mixtures of intermediates and the<br><br>
final product, requiring chiral resolution. Previous methods are therefore too costly and/or complicated to scale up to commercial scale. To this date there is no known commercial process for the production of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol or its' analogs.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide a regio- and stereoselective process for opening an epoxide ring, thereby providing a regio- and stereoselective process for preparing (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-1-ol. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for the regio- and stereoselective opening of an epoxide ring, the process comprising reacting a compound having the epoxide ring with at least one amine in the presence of at least one Lewis acid.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol and analogs thereof. In a preferred embodiment the process comprises reacting (+)-limonene oxide with an amine in the presence of a Lewis acid to form amine adduct intermediates. The desired amine adduct intermediate is formed at a ratio of.greater than 20:1 over other reaction products. The desired amine adduct is then oxidized to form an N-oxide that is pyrolized to form (4-)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol. In an alternative embodiment the amine adduct is converted to an acid salt and then base hydrolyzed to form (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol.<br>
These are merely two illustrative aspects of the present invention and should not be deemed an all-inclusive listing of the innumerable aspects associated with the present invention. These and other aspects will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the following disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
There is provided a process for the regio  and stereoselective opening of an epoxide ring, where one carbon of the epoxide ring is more substituted. A compound having such an epoxide ring is reacted with an amine in the presence of a Lewis acid. The chemistry for the reaction of the epoxide ring with secondary amines is known in the art. However, by introducing a Lewis acid catalyst to chelate or complex with the oxygen atom of the epoxide, the partial charge on the two carbon atoms of the epoxide ring is changed. Experimental results suggest that the less substituted carbon is more prone to nucleophilic attack. This allows for the regio- and stereoselective opening of the epoxide ring.<br>
This process can be used to prepare (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol and analogs thereof, as follows:<br><br><br><br>
wherein R4 is an alkyl, alkenyl or alcohol.<br>
This process is described in more detail in the following example of a process for the regio-and stereoselective preparation of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol as follows:<br><br><br><br>
Reaction step (a) comprises reacting a mixture of cis and trans isomers of (+)-limonene oxide (Formula (lb)) with at least one amine in the presence of at least one Lewis acid. The amine may be primary, wherein R2 and R3 are H; secondary, wherein R3 is H; or tertiary. The choice of R1 in the primary amine, R1 and R2 in the secondary amine and R1, R2 and R3 in the tertiary amine are limited only in that R1, R2and R3 must not interfere with the reaction, either by chemical reaction or sterically. For practical reasons suitable amines include, but are not limited to, amines wherein R1, R2 and R3 are lower alkyl radicals having from about 1 to about 6 carbons, or aryl groups.<br>
The Lewis acid may be any compound containing an element that is two electrons short of having a complete valence shell, as is well known in the art. Suitable Lewis acids include but are not limited to non-protic acids including metals, primarily halides, alkyls, and ether complexes thereof. Suitable alkyl metal halides include MRX wherein R is an alkyl, preferably having 1 to 6 carbons. M is a metal, including but not limited to Group II metals, and X is a halide. Suitable ether complexes include those of the formula<br><br>
MOR, wherein M is a metal and R is an alkyl, preferably having 1 to 6 carbons. While the metal is typically selected from Group I alkali metals, any suitable metal may be utilized. In one embodiment of the present invention, M is selected from Li, K and Na, and R is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl<br>
The reaction products of step (a) are the amine adducts Formula (2b) and Formula (3b). Step (a) leads to a significant improvement of the regio- and stereoselectivity of the reaction of (+)-limonene oxide with the primary or secondary amine. Only one major product, the desired Formula (2b), is produced. Formula (2b) is fomied at a ratio of greater than 20:1 over Formula (3b). The Lewis acid also allows the reaction to be carried out at lower temperatures than previously, typically 30° C to 80° C, with about 50° C being preferred in an embodiment utilizing LiOAc as the Lewis acid.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the (+)-trans-limonene oxide does not react and can be easily recovered by well known methods, thereby providing a means for diastereomeric separation of the two (+)-limonene oxide isomers. The Formula (2b) amine adduct intermediate is also easily purified by making and acid salt. Suitable acids include but are not limited to HC1 salt using concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%).<br>
In step (b), the amine adduct of Formula (2b) is oxidized to form the N-oxide of Formula (4b). In a preferred embodiment the amine adduct Formula (2b) is oxidized with a peracid, for example about 30% to about 50% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of at least one alcohol. Suitable alcohols include but are not limited to alkyl alcohols having, for practical reasons, from about 1 to about 6 carbons, including but not limited to methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, t-butanol, and branched,<br><br>
unbranched and cyclic pentanol and hexanol. This reaction is also accomplished at a relatively lower temperature, about 50° C when the alcohol utilized is ethanol.<br>
In step (c), the N-oxide intermediate Formula (4b) is pyrolized to produce (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol. This pyrolysis reaction to eliminate the tertiary amine oxide is known as a Cope elimination. In a preferred embodiment the pyrolysis takes place in a solvent system including toluene at a temperature of at least about 110° C, or at any temperature at which the pyrolysis reaction will occur given the experimental conditions. In an alternative embodiment, the pyrolysis takes place in toluene in the presence of at least one particulate matter such as zeolites or silica gels. In a preferred embodiment the particulate matter is SiO2 or molecular sieves.<br>
The overall yield of the conversion of (+)-limonene oxide to (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-1-ol of the present invention is typically about 50%.<br>
An alternative embodiment for the conversion of the amine adduct to (+)-p-<br><br><br>
wherein R4 is an alkyl, alkenyl or alcohol; and wherein X is a halide.<br>
This alternative process is described in more detail in the following example for the preparation of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol as follows:<br>
Formula (2b)	Formula (6b)	Formula (5b)<br>
The amine adduct of Formula (2b) reacts with the R5X to form the quaternary salt of Formula (6b) that is then heated under basic condition to form (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol of Formula (5b). In a one suitable embodiment, Mel is used, as illustrated below.<br><br>
Formula (2b)	Formula (6b)	Formula (5b)<br>
The amine adduct of Formula (2b) is converted to the quaternary salt of Formula (6b), and then base hydrolyzed under heat to form (+)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol of Formula (5b).<br><br>
The following examples are offered to illustrate the process of the present invention, and are not intended to limit or define the present invention in any manner. Examples Example 1<br>
