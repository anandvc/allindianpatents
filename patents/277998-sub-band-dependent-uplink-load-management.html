SUB-BAND DEPENDENT UPLINK LOAD MANAGEMENT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This appHcation claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application<br>
Serial No. 60/864,576 entitled "UPLINK INTER-CELL INTERFERENCE MANAGEMENT" which was filed November 6, 2006. The entirety of the aforementioned application is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	I.	Field<br>
[0003]	The following description relates generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more particularly to inter-cell interference management in a wireless communication system.<br>
[0004]	IL        Background<br>
[0005]	A typical wireless communication network (e.g., employing frequency,<br>
time and code division techniques) includes one or more base stations that provide a coverage area and one or more mobile (e.g., wireless) terminals that can transmit and receive data within the coverage area. A typical base station can concurrently transmit multiple data streams for broadcast, multicast, and/or unicast services, wherein a data stream is a stream of data that can be of independent reception interest to a mobile temiinaJ. A mobile terminal within coverage area of the base station can be interested in receiving one, more than one, or all data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, a mobile terminal can transmit data to the base station, other stations or other mobile terminals. Each terminal communicates with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-signal-out or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.<br>
 <br>
[0006]	Conventional technologies utilized for transmitting information within a<br>
mobile communication network (e.g., a cell phone network) include frequency, time and code division based techniques. In general, with frequency division based techniques calls are split based on a frequency access method, wherein respective calls are placed on a separate frequency. With time division based techniques, respective calls are assigned a certain portion of time on a designated frequency. With code division based techniques respective calls are associated with unique codes and spread over available frequencies. Respective technologies can accommodate multiple accesses by one or more users.<br>
[0007]	With time division based techniques, a band is split time-wise into<br>
sequential time slices or time slots. Each user of a channel is provided with a time slice for transmitting and receiving information in a round-robin manner. For example, at any given time t, a user is provided access to the channel for a short burst. Then, access switches to another user who is provided with a short burst of time for transmitting and receiving information. The cycle of "taking turns" continues, and eventually each user is provided with multiple transmission and reception bursts.<br>
(0008]	Code division based techniques typically transmit data over a number of<br>
frequencies available at any time in a range. In general, data is digitized and spread<br>
over available bandwidth, wherein multiple users can be overlaid on the channel and<br>
respective users can be assigned a unique sequence code. Users can transmit in the<br>
same wide-band chunk of spectrum, wherein each user's signal is spread over the entire<br>
bandwidth by its respective unique spreading code. This technique can provide for<br>
sharing, wherein one or more users can concurrently transmit and receive. Such sharing<br>
can be achieved through spread spectrum digital modulation, wherein a user's stream of<br>
bits is encoded and spread across a very wide channel in a pseudo-random fashion. The<br>
receiver is designed to recognize the associated unique sequence code and undo the<br>
randomization in order to collect the bits for a particular user in a coherent manner.<br>
[0009]	More particularly, frequency division based techniques typically separate<br>
the spectrum into distinct channels by splitting it into uniform chunks of bandwidth, for example, division of the frequency band allocated for wireless cellular telephone communication can be split into 30 chaimels, each of which can carry a voice conversation or, with digital service, carry digital data. Each channel can be assigned to only one user at a time.<br>
 <br>
[OOIOJ	One commonly utilized variant is an orthogonal frequency division<br>
technique that effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subbands. Orthogonal meaning that the frequencies are chosen so that cross¬talk between the sub-channels is eliminated and inter-carrier guard bands are not required. These subbands are also referred to as tones, carriers, subcarriers, bins, and frequency channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation) at a low symbol rate. Orthogonal frequency division has an advantageous ability to cope with severe channel conditions — for example, attenuation of high frequencies at a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath — without complex equalization filters. Low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to handle time-spreading and eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI).<br>
[0011]	The orthogonality also allows high spectral efficiency, near the Nyquist<br>
rate. Almost the whole a\'ai]able frequency band can be utilized. OFDM generall&gt;' has a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users, and allowing higher transmit power when a single cell is considered alone. Also, without interior -carrier guard bands, the design of both the transmitter and the receiver is greatly simplified; unlike conventional FDM, a separate filter for each sub-charmel is not required.<br>
[0012]	Orthogonality is often paired with fi-equency reuse, where<br>
communications taking place in cells located far apart may use the same portion of the spectrum, and ideally the large distance prevents interference. Cell communications taking place in nearby cells use different channels to minimize the chances of interference. Over a large pattern of cells, a frequency spectrum is reused as much as possible by distributing common channels over the entire pattern so that only far apart cells reuse the same spectrum. In such a case, and when scheduler flexibility to allocate bandwidth to different users is introduced, inter-cell interference control becomes critical.<br>
10013]	With OFDM intra-cetl interference is effectively contained. The<br>
roadblock to greater system efficiency becomes inter-cell interference. Methods to improve management of inter-cell interference, and at the same time be robust enough to handle various cell varieties (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous) and support a<br>
 <br>
variety of user devices or end nodes (e.g., expensive, feature laden as well as economical, basic use), requires consideration in the wireless communications arena.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0014]	The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic<br>
understanding of some aspects of the disclosed embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such embodiments. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the described embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.<br>
[0015]	In an aspect, a method to mitigate inter-cell interference gains granularity<br>
and increased efficiency by dividing communications bandwidth into multiple subbands and providing a load indicator per subband. The load per subband information is provided as binary load indicator data and is provided for both a serving cell and broadcast to neighboring cells. A user equipment (UE) has access to both the servmg cell and non-serving neighbor cell's load indicator data on a per subband basis, which provides for a level of granularity that allows for more complete use of the bandwidth, and more UE's can operate at load within a given bandwidth.<br>
[0016]	In another aspect a method to control and reduce inter-cell interference<br>
through UE based load management is disclosed. The method robustly handles multiple cells that operate either synchronously or asynchronously, and allows an individual UE capability to be a factor in optimizing the reduction of inter-cell interference. When a UE is started, it typically receives a message from the serving cell access node indicating the type of serving cell operation (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous). The type of operation can force the UE to follow one method or another in reducing inter-cell interference. The current method allows the UE to seek the best method of mter-cell interference reduction that may not be dependent on the serving cell's mode of operation. In one non-limiting example, an UE may be operating in a asynchronous cell but have the capability of accessing a neighbor cell's load data directly. In this case, the UE may operate to reduce or maintain its transmitting power spectral density depending on a faster direct neighbor cell binary load per subband information rather than waiting<br>
 <br>
for the neighbor cell binary load per subband information that may arrive through a backhaul channel of the serving cell.<br>
[0017]	In an aspect, a method to mitigate inter-cell interference gains granularity<br>
and increased efficiency by dividing communications bandwidth into multiple subbands<br>
and providing a load metric corresponding to observed load per subband. The load<br>
metric can be provided for both to user equipment (UE) and broadcast to neighboring<br>
cells. The serving cell can also receive load metrics per subband from adjacent cells<br>
through a backhaul channel, and provide this to UEs. User equipment can also have<br>
access of load metrics on a per subband basis directly from adjacent cells.<br>
[0018]	In another aspect a method for UE based communication system is<br>
disclosed. The UE receives adjacent cell load metric information on a subband basis. The UE determines the source of the load metric information. If the information is directly from an adjacent cell (e.g. the information flow through he backhaul is not available), the UE determines if the assigned subband is loaded in the adjacent cell metrics, and if so can then reduce its transmit power spectral density. If the metric indicates an unloaded condition, the UE maintains the assigned subband transmit power spectral density. If the source of the load metric information is not the adjacent cell, the UE maintains the assigned transmit power spectral density as dictated by the serving cell.<br>
[0019]	In an aspect, a method that facilitates inter-cell interference mitigation,<br>
comprises: dividing a cell bandwidth into N subbands, where N is an integer &gt; 2;<br>
assigning the respective sub-bands to respective user equipment (UEs); tracking sub-<br>

thereon computer readable instructions for performing acts comprising: dividing a ceil bandwidth into N subbands, where N is an integer &gt; 2; assigning the respective sub-bands to respective user equipment (UEs); tracking sub-band assignments; and broadcast sub-band assignments to neighboring cells.<br>

comprising computer executable instructions stored thereon for carrying out the following acts: dividing a cell bandwidth into N subbands, where N is an integer &gt; 2; assigning the respective sub-bands to respective user equipment (UEs); tracking sub-<br>

band assignments; and broadcasting sub-band assignments to neighboring cells. A processor executes the computer executable instructions.<br>

comprises: means for dividing a cell bandwidth into N subbands, where N is an integer &gt; 2; means for assigning the respective sub-bands to respective user equipment (UEs); means for tracking sub-band assignments; and means for broadcasting sub-band assignments to neighboring cells.<br>
[0023]	In another aspect, a method that facilitates inter-cell interference<br>
mitigation, comprises: receiving an assigned sub-band; identifying capabilities of a user equipment (UE); if the UE meets a capability threshold, look at neighboring cells for conflicting sub-band load indicator data; if a conflict exists, reduce UE power; andifa conflict does not exist, maintain UE power.<br>
[0024]	In yet another aspect, a computer readable storage medium has stored<br>
thereon computer readable instructions for performing acts comprising: receiving an assigned sub-band; identifying capabilities of a user equipment (UE); if the UE meets a capability threshold, look at neighboring cells for conflicting sub-band load indicator data; if a conflict exists, reduce UE power; and if a conflict does not exist, maintain UE power.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
(0055]	The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the<br>
drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are<br>
set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It<br>
may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without<br>
these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown<br>
in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.<br>
[0056]	Various embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings,<br>
wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however, that such embodiment{s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more embodiments. As used in this<br>
 <br>
application, the terms "component," "module," "system," and the like are intended to<br>
refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware<br>
and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be,<br>
but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an integrated<br>
circuit, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer.<br>
By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the<br>
computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a<br>
process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer<br>
and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can<br>
execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored<br>
thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and/or remote processes<br>
such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one<br>
component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system,<br>
and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).<br>
[0057]	Various embodiments will be presented in terms of systems that may<br>
include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.<br>
[0058]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example,<br>
instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs. The word "listening" is used herein to mean that a recipient device (access point or access terminal) is receiving and processing data received on a given channel.<br>
[0059]	Various aspects can incorporate inference schemes and/or techniques in<br>
connection with transitioning communication resources. As used herein, the term "inference" refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system, environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic - that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest<br>
 <br>
based on a consideration of data and events, or decision theoretic, building upon probabilistic inference, and considering display actions of highest expected utility, in the context of uncertainty in user goals and intentions. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.<br>
(0060]	Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a<br>

[0062]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communication system 100 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herem. System 100 can comprise a base station 102 that receives, transmits, repeats, etc., wireless communication signals to a wireless terminal 104. Further, it is contemplated that system 100 may include a plurality of base stations similar to base station 102 and/or a<br>
 <br>
plurality of wireless terminals similar to wireless terminal 104. Base station 102 can comprise a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Base station 102 may be a fixed station and/or mobile. Wireless terminal 104 can be, for example, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a laptop, a handheld communication device, a handheld computing device, a satellite radio, a global positioning system, a PDA, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 100. Also, wireless terminal 104 may be fixed or mobile.<br>
[0063]	Wireless terminal 104 may communicate with base station 102 (and/or<br>
disparate base station(s)) on a downlink and/or an uplink channel at any given moment. The downlink refers to the communication link ftom base station 102 to wireless terminal 104, and the uplink channel refers to the communication link from wireless terminal 104 to base station 102. Base station 102 may further communicate with other base station(s) and/or any disparate devices (e.g., servers) (not shovm) that may perform functions such as, for example, authentication and authorization of wireless terminal 104, accounting, billing, and so on.<br>
[0064]	Base station 102 may further include a power controller 106, and a<br>
wireless terminal verifier 108. Power controller 106 may measure a power level associated with wireless terminal 104 (and/or any disparate wireless terminals). Further, power controller 106 may transmit power commands to wireless terminal 104 to facilitate adjusting the power level. For instance, power controller 106 may transmit a power command in one or more transmission units associated with a first subset of transmission units. The power commands, for instance, may indicate to increase a power level, decrease a power level, remain at a power level, and the like. Upon receipt of power commands to increase or decrease power, wireless terminal 104 may alter an associated power level a fixed (e.g., preset) and/or variable amount. The preset amounts may be of variable size based on certain factors (e.g., frequency reuse factors, channel conditions at different mobile stations). Further, wireless terminal verifier 108 may transmit information as a fiinction of a terminal identifier related to a wireless terminal (e.g., wireless terminal 104) in one or more transmission units associated with a second subset of transmission units. Moreover, one or more ON identifiers may be assigned to<br>
 <br>
each wireless terminal when in session ON state and the ON identifiers may be associated with a first subset and second subset of transmission mnts. Transmission units may be in variable formats (e.g., time domain, frequency domain, hybrid of both time and fi"equency domains).<br>
[0065]	Power controller 106 may transmit power commands over a downlink<br>
power control channel (DLPCCH). Pursuant to an example, resources may be assigned to wireless terminal 104 by base station 102 as wireless terminal 104 accesses a session ON state; such resources may include particular DLPCCH segments, one or more ON identifiers, etc. The DLPCCH may be utilized by a base station sector attachment point (e.g., employing power controller 106) to transmit downlink power control messages to control transmission power of wireless terminal 104.<br>
[0066]	Wireless terminal verifier 108 may transmit information associated with<br>
a wireless terminal (e.g., wireless terminal 104) to which the power commands correspond along with the power commands transferred by power controller 106. For example, wireless terminal verifier 108 may transmit information as a fimction of a terminal identifier (e.g., scrambling mask) associated with the wireless terminal (e.g., wireless terminal 104). Wireless terminal verifier 108 may transfer such information over the DLPCCH. Piu-suant to an illustration, information associated with wireless terminal 104 may be transmitted over the DLPCCH with a subset of the power command transmissions from power controller 106.<br>
[0067]	Wireless terminal 104 may fiirther include a verification information<br>
comparator 110 that evaluates the received information associated with wireless terminal 104. Verification information comparator 110 may analyze the received information to determine whether wireless terminal 104 is utilizing resources as set forth by base station 102: thus, verificafion information comparator 110 may evaluate information included in the Q component of symbols transmitted over the DLPCCH. For instance, base station 102 may have assigned identifier(s) (e.g., session ON ID) to wireless terminal 104, and verification information comparator 110 may analyze whether wireless terminal 104 employs appropriate resources associated with the assigned identifier(s). According to other examples, verification information comparator 110 may determine whether wireless terminal 104 is utilizing segments of the DLPCCH allocated by base station 102 and/or whether base station 102 has reclaimed resources (e.g., session ON ID) previously assigned to wireless terminal 104.<br>
 <br>
[0068]	It is to be appreciated that the base station 102 or wireless terminal 110,<br>
given respective state, can serve as user equipment (UE). For uplink communications, it is desirable to control reverse link load. Conventionally, a single control is typically employed for time-frequency bands; however, doing so results in a relatively inflexible framework. By dividing a communications band into several sub-bands increased flexibility is achieved as to conventional schemes - this affords for increased control granularity by having different control thresholds over respective sub-bands as well as allowing for distinct control per sub-band. The increase in control provides for using sub-bands for different purposes, and more efficient usage of reverse up-link resources as compared to conventional schemes. Market forces have moved the industry toward simple communications protocols in an attempt to optimize system performance. The aspects described and claimed herein run counter to conventional wisdom and market forces by increasing processing overhead via utilization of multiple sub-bands and control thereof However, as a resuU of enduring such perceived processing load, overall system performance optimization is facilitated as a result of the flexibility afforded by more granular control of sub-bands and increased utilization of system resources. For example, in conventional systems with single control every user within a given cell can increase power which can resuh in interference to neighboring cells. In response, UE in neighboring cells would likely respond by increasing their power to overcome the interference which in turn would cause interference in the other cell. Consequently, such convergence toward power boosting compounds interference created.<br>
[0069]	More particularly, interference management in orthogonal systems is<br>
facilitated by identifying and mitigating caused by neighboring celts. Communications bandwidth is divided into multiple subbands, and load indicator(s) are provided per subband.   As noted supra, doing so mitigates inter-cell interference, improves control granularity, and facilitates overall utilization of system resources. The load per subband information is provided as binary load indicator data and is provided for both a serving cell and broadcast to neighboring cells. The user equipment (UE) has access to both the serving cell and non-serving neighbor cell's load indicator data on a per subband basis, which provides for a level of granularity that allows for more complete use of the bandwidth, and more UE's can operate at load within a given bandwidth.<br>
 <br>
[0070]	UE based load management can be handled across multiple cells that<br>
operate either synchronously or asynchronously. This allows an individual UE capability to be a factor in optimizing the reduction of inter-cell interference. When a UE is started, it typically receives a message from the serving cell access node indicating type of serving cell operation (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous). The type of operation can force the UE to follow one method or another in reducing inter-cell interference. The current method allows the UE to seek a best method of inter-cell interference reduction that may not be dependent on the serving cell's mode of operation. In one non-limiting example, an UE may be operating in a asynchronous cell hut have the capability of accessing a neighbor cell's load data directly. In this case, the UE may operate to reduce or maintain its transmitting power spectral density depending on a faster direct neighbor cell binary load per subband information rather than waiting for the neighbor cell binary load per subband information that may arrive through a backhaul channel of the serving cell.<br>
[0071]	In orthogonal cellular systems, inter-cell interference needs to be<br>
mitigated to ensure cell-edge quality of service (QoS). Different systems employ different forms of techniques, but in essence there are two schools of thought. In a network based solution, each cell controls the transmit power spectral density (Tx PSD) of each UE based on its neighbor cell signal to noise ratio (SNR) measurements - this is similar to general packet radio service (GPRS). In a UE based solution, each UE controls its own Tx PSD based on neighbor cell SNR. Furthermore, in the UE based solution there are two aspects. In a neighbor cell based aspect, each UE monitors an uplink load indicator transmitted by a subset of the neighbor cells that it detects - similar to high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), LTE, and DOrC. In a serving cell aspect, the serving cell broadcasts uplink load of the geographical neighbor cells (e.g., used in flash). Aspects described herein employ a UE based uphnk load management scheme that combines the above two solutions appropriately.<br>
[0072]	In the UE based approach, there are pros and cons of each solution. In<br>
the neighbor cell based aspect, the UE can detect neighbor cell load quickly. However, in asynchronous systems, the UE needs to maintain multiple fast fourier transform (FFT) timings, one for each neighbor cell detected - this can be a con. In the serving cell based aspect, the UE does not need to maintain any neighbor cell timing - this is advantageous. However, load information needs to propagate through a backhaul (con).<br>
 <br>
[0073]	A hybrid approach {e.g., combining various features) results in improved<br>
performance. To combine, each cell broadcasts both parameters: uplink inter-cell<br>
interference seen at the receiver (Rx). A binary valued load indicator is employed per<br>
subband, and this indicates whether the respective cell is loaded on a particular subband<br>
or not. A subband is smaller than or equal to the total system bandwidth (e.g., 20 MHz<br>
system with 20 subbands of 900 KHz each and a spanned bandwidth of 18 MHz). The<br>
transmission is done on a primary broadcast channel (BCH). Regarding neighbor cell<br>
load, loading is done from geographically close cells, and load is indicated per subband.<br>
[0074]	With respect to UE behavior, the UE reduces Tx PSD depending on<br>
detected neighbor cell load. Detection is based on either of two approaches: (1)<br>
decoded load indicator transmitted from neighbor cell; and (2) decoded neighbor cell<br>
load information transmitted from serving cell. In synchronous systems, the UE relies<br>
on load indicators transmitted from neighbor cell. In asynchronous systems, the UE<br>
relies on neighbor cell load information transmitted from the serving cell.<br>
[0075]	In an alternative aspect, one could envision behavior in asynchronous<br>
systems dependent on UE capability (e.g., ability to maintain multiple Rx timing, Tx BW capability (10 MHz vs. 20 MHz, and peak data rate capability). The UE is aware whether the system is synchronous or not, and the information is fransmitted as part of system parameters on BCH (broadcast channel).<br>
[0076]	FIG. 2 provides an illustration of an aspect of the current invention. As<br>
pictured, a given bandwidth comprises a number of subbands 201 (e.g. subbands 1 to N). Each subband then provides a binary valued load indicator 502 showing if that subband is in use 204 or is available for use 205 in a particular cell. The finer granularity can be seen when compared to the bandwidth binary valued load indicator as provided with subband division 203, where subbands 3 to N are actually available when subbands 1 and 2 are in use.<br>
[0077]	In another aspect, the determination of whether a subband is loaded is<br>
based on the load factor for that subband rising above a pre-determined threshold value.<br>
[0078]	The preceding discussion focused on dividing bandwidth into subbands<br>
for a given cell. U is to be understood that the disclosed aspects are not limited by this example and includes other applications such as dividing a cell into sectors and then dividing the sector bands into subbands.<br>
 <br>
[0079]	With reference to FIG. 3, illustrated is an exemplary communication<br>
system 300 (e.g., a cellular communication network) implemented in accordance with various aspects, which comprises a plurality of nodes interconnected by communications links 305, 307, 308, 311, 341, 341', 341", 341A, 345, 345', 345", 345S, 347, 347', 347" and 347S. Nodes in exemplary communication system 300 may exchange information using signals (e.g., messages) based on communication protocols (e.g., the Internet Protocol (IP)). The communications links of system 300 may be implemented, for example, using wires, fiber optic cables, and/or wireless communications techniques. Exemplary communication system 300 includes a plurality of end nodes 344, 346, 344', 346', 344", 346", which access communication system 300 via a plurality of access nodes 340, 340', and 340". End nodes 344, 346, 344', 346', 344", 346" may be, e.g., wireless communication devices or terminals, and access nodes 340, 340', 340" may be, e.g., wireless access routers or base stations. Exemplary communication system 300 also includes a number of other nodes 304, 306, 309, 310, and 312, used to provide interconnectivity or to provide specific services or functions (e.g. backhaul path for serving and non-serving cell subband binary value load indicator data). Specifically, exemplary communication system 300 includes a Server 304 used to support transfer and storage of state pertaining to end nodes. The Server node 304 may be an AAA server, a Context Transfer Server, a server including both AAA server fionctionality and Context Transfer server functionality.<br>
[00801	Exemplary communication system 300 depicts a network 302 that<br>
includes Server 304, node 306 and a home agent node 309, which are connected to an intermediate network node 310 by corresponding network links 305, 307 and 308, respectively. Intermediate network node 310 in network 302 also provides interconnectivity to network nodes that are external from the perspective of network 302 via network link 311. Network link 311 is connected to another intermediate network node 312, which provides furdier connectivity to a plurality of access nodes 340, 340', 340" via network links 341, 341', 341", respectively.<br>
[0081]	Each access node 340, 340', 340" is depicted as providing connectivity<br>
to a plurality of N end nodes (344, 346), (344', 346'), (344", 346"), respectively, via corresponding access links (345, 347), (345', 347'), (345", 347"), respectively. In synchronous systems, access links such as 345S and 347S may also be available. In synchronous or asynchronous systems, end nodes may have the capability of<br>
 <br>
establishing access links to access nodes outside their own cell environments depicted by 341 A. In exemplary commumcation system 300, each access node 340, 340', 340" is depicted as using wireless technology (e.g., wireless access links) to provide access. A radio coverage area (e.g., communications cells 348, 348', and 348") of each access node 340, 340', 340", respectively, is illustrated as a circle surrounding the corresponding access node.<br>
[0082]	Exemplar)' communication system 300 is presented as a basis for the<br>
description of various aspects set forth herein. Further, various disparate network<br>
topologies are intended to fall within the scope of the claimed subject matter, where the<br>
number and type of network nodes, the number and type of access nodes, the number<br>
and type of end nodes, the number and type of Servers and other Agents, the number<br>
and type of links, and the interconnectivity between nodes may differ &amp;om tliat of<br>
exemplary communication system 300 depicted in Fig. 3. Additionally, functional<br>
entities depicted in exemplary communication system 100 may be omitted or combined.<br>
Also, the location or placement of the functional entities in the network may be varied.<br>
[0083]	Control traffic is often transmitted with channel-independent rates. Cell<br>
edge users generally experience severe channel impairments and more likely become power limited. As well as power limitations, error rates may increase and advanced error control mechanisms such as H-ARQ may not be as applicable to control traffic as well as data. The loT operating level is typically limited by control traffic from cell edge users. These factors contribute to an often low loT operation point, e.g., around 5dB. Thus the uplink load metric (e.g. the loT operating level) is typically lunited by control traffic from cell edge users.<br>
[0084]	However, users with good channel conditions are less likely to be power-<br>
limited and capable of supporting a much higher loT point. The inflexible and low loT operation level from the cell edge thus makes the uplink load management for data traffic uimecessarily inefficient.<br>
[0085]	An uplink load management mechanism is described which exploits<br>
distinct uplink load operating level requirements for subbands, instead of a same operation level across an entire available band, and is robust to serve a variety of cell types (e.g. synchronous or asynchronous) as well as end node capability (e.g. capable to produce path 341 A). By introducing and properly managing subband dependent uplink load information, larger per user throughput and sector throughput can be achieved.<br>
 <br>
[0086]	The configuration of subbands can be dynamically changed over time<br>
and may adapt to system conditions, and can be different for different sectors (not shown).<br>

wireless terminal) associated with various aspects. Exemplary end node 400 may be an apparatus that may be used as any one of the end nodes depicted in Fig. 4 (e.g. 444, 446, 444', 446', 444", 446").

can exchange information, signals and data with other components of end node 400 via<br>
user input/output interface 440 and bus 406. User inpuVoutput interface 440 and<br>
associated devices (e.g., user input device 442, user output device 444) provide a<br>
mechanism by which a user can operate end node 400 to accomplish various tasks, In<br>

[0099]	FIG. 6 provides an illustration of an exemplary aspect of cell neighbors<br>
in a multi-cell network. A cell as represented by its service area 652 has neighbor cells 650, 651, 653, 654, 655 and 656. These neighbor cells are adjacent to cell 652. These service areas are analogous to figure 3 (e.g., 348, 348', and 348"), Equally, A cell may be represented by access node 642 and its neighbors 640, 641, 643, 644, 645 and 646. These are analogous to figure 3 (e.g., 340, 340', 340"). For a device or User Equipment (UE) 660 within a service area 650, the UE is served by the cell 650 if the cell 650 is the primary provider of resources for the UE. According to an aspect of the current invention, each cell broadcasts (e.g. on the BCH channel) the subband binary valued load indicator data for subbands 1 to N (binary data bits ! to N for the fi-equency subbands in use in that cell). In addition to its own load indicator data, the cell through the backhaul channel will also transmit the binary valued load indicator data on a subband basis for its neighbors cell activity. At a minimum, access node 642 provides the load data for end nodes 662 and 672 as well as which subbands all neighboring cells are using including end nodes 660, 670, 671 and 661.<br>
[00100]	Note, that while this an exemplary model, this invention is not limited to<br>
this model and covers all permutations as captured in the claims. If the cells are sectored as in a frequency reuse scenario, then the adjacent sector load metric per subband would be transmitted (not shown).<br>
[00101]	Referring now to FIG. 7, an exemplary aspect of inter-cell interference<br>
mitigafion is presented. In cell 750, end nodes 770 and 760 use subbands 1 and 2 as represented hy the subband load indicator 790. For that same frequency band, also used in cell 751, the subband load indicator 791 illustrates which subband end node 771 is using. As illustrated, end node 761 is using a different frequency band altogether. This allows the PSD of 771, 760 and 770 to remain at their respective levels since the increased granularity allows more efficient and denser use of the fi-equency subbands in the given frequency used in the different cells. The subband load indicators illustrates<br>
 <br>
that even though the end nodes are all in the same frequency band, there is no interference, and allows more complete use of the resources.<br>
[00102]	In view of exemplary aspects described herein, methodologies that can<br>
be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter are discussed. While, for purposes of simplicity, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the number or order of blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement respective methodologies. It is to be appreciated that the functionality associated with various blocks may be implemented by software, hardware, a combination thereof or any other suitable means (e.g., device, system, process, component). Additionally, it should be further appreciated that some methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to various devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate and understand that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as for example in a state diagram,<br>
[00103]	FIG. 8 illustrates a high-level methodology in accordance with various<br>
aspects. At 804, cell bandwidth is divided into N sub-bands (N being an integer &gt;2). At 806, respective sub-bands are assigned to respective user equipment (UE). It is to be appreciated that a variety of assignment protocols can be employed in connection with making sub-band assignments. For example, respective sub-bands can be designated for particular purposes (e.g., data type, power level, distance, interference mitigation, load-balancing...}, andUEs can be respectively assigned to sub-bands as a function of affinity thereto. In another example, an optimization scheme can be employed in connection with assigrunents. Likewise, extrinsic information (e.g., environmental factors, preferences, QoS, customer preferences, customer ranking, historical information) can be employed. In another example, assignment can be a function of load-balancing across a cell or a plurality of cells.<br>
[00104]	An embodiment f the methodology can employ an artificial intelligence<br>
techniques to facilitate automatically performing various aspects (e.g., transitioning communications resources, analyzing resources, extrinsic information, user/UE state,<br>
 <br>
preferences, sub-band assignments, power level setting) as described herein. Moreover, inference based schemes can be employed to facilitate inferring intended actions to be performed at a given time and state. The Al-based aspects of the invention can be effected via any suitable machine-learning based technique and/or slatisticaJ-based techniques and/or probabiUstic-based techniques. For example, the use of expert systems, fuzzy logic, support vector machines (SVMs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), greedy search algorithms, rule-based systems, Bayesian models (e.g., Bayesian networks), neural networks, other non-linear training techniques, data fusion, utility-based analytical systems, systems employing Bayesian models, etc. are contemplated.<br>
[00105]	At 808, sub-band assignments are tracked. At 810, sub-band<br>
assignments are broadcast to neighboring cells (e.g., to apprise base stations or UEs in such neighboring cells of sub-band assigmnents). At 812, neighboring cell sub-band assignments are monitored. At 814, as a function of such monitoring, if it is determined that a conflict exists with respect to sub-band assignments at 816 control information is sent to particular UEs to reduce power in connection with mitigating inter-cell interference due to the conflict, for example. If no conflict exists, at 818 the UEs maintain power level.<br>
[00106]	It can be readily appreciated from the foregoing that by sub-dividing<br>
bandwidth into respective sub-bands a more granular tuning of UE power-level can be<br>
achieved as compared to conventional schemes. As a result, overall system resource<br>
utilization as well as inter-cell interference mitigation is facilitated.<br>
[00107]	FIG. 9 illustrates a high-level methodology in accordance with various<br>
aspects. At 904, sub-band assignment(s) are received by a user equipment. At 906, a determination or identification is made as to respective capabilities/functionalities of the UE. If the UE is deemed to not possess certain capabilities/functionalities, the UE simply listens for commands from a base station in connection with sub-band assignments at 908. However, if the UE does possess certain capabilities or functionalities in connection with aspects described herein, at 910, the UE looks to neighboring cells for conflicting sub-band load indicator data. At 912, a determination is made regarding whether or not a conflict exists as a function of respective sub-band load indicator data. If a conflict does exist, the UE reduces power level to mitigate<br>
 <br>
interference it may cause. If it is determined that a conflict does not exist, at 914, the UE maintains power level.<br>
[00108]	FIG. 10 highlights exemplary logic for a management method in<br>
accordance with various aspects. The management method 1000 is for a UE based inter-cell interference mitigation system that robustly handles both synchronous and asynchronous orthogonal systems. At 1004, for each UE in a given serving cell, the UE receives a serving ceil Type message indicating whether the serving cell is operating in synchronous or asynchronous mode. At 1006, the US determines or is informed of whether a serving cell is synchronous or asynchronous. If the cell is synchronous, the process proceeds to 1018 where the US looks to the serving cell orneighboring cells for binary sub-band load data. If at 1006, the cell is asynchronous, the process proceed to 1012 where capabilities of the UE are assessed. If the UE is deemed to have advanced capabilities, the process proceeds to 1018. If the US is deemed to have basic capabilities, the process proceeds to 1016 where the UE looks to the serving cell for backhauled binary sub-band data. Block 1018 signifies various advantages {e.g. faster neighbor cell detection, neighbor cell load data being obtained directly from the neighbor cell). For other less capable UE, path 1016 will still provide the novel binary subband load data transmitted from UE's serving cell and obtained through the backhaul channel. In either path, the binary load data per sub-band is obtained and a comparison at 1020 then can take place.<br>
[00109]	At this point the finer granularity as shown in Figure 7 will provide the<br>
UE with the control direction to take either step 1022 or 1024 with increased room for<br>
more UE operating in the different subbands of a given bandwidth.<br>
[00110]	This can be contrasted with Figures 11 and 12, which shows the less<br>
robust conventional alternatives. In FIG 11, upon start 1102, the UE receives the<br>
serving cell Type message 1104 and the serving cell type mandates the UE's next step<br>
1118. Here the entire bandwidth of the neighboring cells' data as obtained directly and<br>
quickly from the neighbor cells and compared to the load data fi-om the serving cell<br>
1120. The less efficient direction (e.g. UE using non-interfering different subbands<br>
within matching bands will be indicated as causing interference when they in actuality<br>
are not) for the UE is dictated and either 1122 or 1124 will then be taken.<br>
[00111]	In FIG. 12, the UE at start 1202 receives the serving cell Type message<br>
1204 which mandates step 1216. Here the entire bandvridth from the slower backhaul<br>
 <br>
channel as provided by the serving cell is obtained and compared to the UE bandwidth<br>
in the serving cell 1220. The less efficient direction (e.g. UE using non-interfering<br>
different subbands within matching bands will be indicated as causing interference<br>
when they in actuality are not) for the UE is dictated and either 1222 or 1224 will then<br>
be taken. UE capability is ignored. The systems as represented in Figures 11 and 12 are<br>
also less UE based as the Serving Cell system mandates the path.<br>
[00112]	FIG. 13 illustrates a system 1300 that facilitates mitigating inter-cell<br>
interference. Component 1302 divides cell bandwidth into N sub-bands (N being an integer &gt;2). Component 1304 assigns respective sub-bands to respective user equipment (UE). It is to be appreciated that a variety of assignment protocols can be employed in connection with making sub-band assignments. For example, respective sub-bands can be designated for particular purposes (e.g., data type, power level, distance, interference mitigation, (oad-balancing...), and UEs can be respectively assigned to sub-bands as a function of affinity thereto. In another example, an optimization scheme (e.g., employing artificial intelligence) can be employed in connection with assignments. Likewise, extrinsic information (e.g., environmental factors, preferences, QoS, customer preferences, customer ranking, historical information) can be employed. In another example, assignment can be a fimction of load-balancing across a cell or a plurality of cells.<br>
[00113]	Component 1308 tracks sub-band assignments, and component 1310<br>
broadcasts sub-band assignments to neighboring cells (e.g., to apprise base stations or UEs in such neighboring cells of sub-band assignments). Component 1312 monitors neighboring cell sub-band assignments. Component 1314 determines if a conflict exists as a function of such monitoring, and if it is determined that a conflict exists with respect to sub-band assignments component 1316 sends control information to particular UEs to reduce power in connection with mitigating inter-cell interference due to the conflict, for example. If no conflict exists, component 1318 send control information to the UEs to maintain power level.<br>
[00114]	FIG. 14 illustrates a high-level methodology in accordance with various<br>
aspects. At 1404, cell bandwidth is divided into a plurality of sub-bands. At 1406, load metric corresponding to observed load on a per subband level is provided to adjacent cells. At 1408, the subband load metrics are broadcast to served UEs.. At 1410, the serving cell receives subband load metrics from adjacent cells. With this<br>
 <br>
information, at 1412 the serving cell can determine if the subband assignment for a served UE is loaded in an adjacent cell. At 1414, if it is determined that there is a loaded adjacent cell for the assigned subband, control information is sent to particular UEs to reduce power spectral density in connection for the conflicted UE. If no conflict exists, at 1416 the UEs maintain power spectral density level.<br>
[00115]	FIG. 15 illustrates a high-level methodology in accordance with various<br>
aspects. At 1504, adjacent cell load metrics per subband are received by a user equipment. At 1506, a determination is made as to the source of the load metric information. If the load metric information is received from the serving cell 1508, the UE maintains the assigned transmit power spectral density 1514. If the source of the load metric is directly an adjacent cell 1510, the load metric is evaluated at 1512, where a detennination is made regarding whether or not the assigned subband is loaded or not. The determination of whether an assigned subband is loaded can be based on the load factor for that subband rising above a pre-determined threshold value. If the assigned subband is not loaded, transmit power spectral density is maintained at 1514. If the load metric indicates a loaded assigned subband in the adjacent cell, the UE reduces its assigned transmit power spectral density 1516.<br>
[00116]	FIG. 16 illustrates a system 1600 that facilitates mitigating inter-cell<br>
interference. Component 1602 divides cell bandwidth into a plurality of sub-bands. Component 1604 provides a load metric corresponding to observed load per subband. Component 1606 broadcasts subband load metrics to neighboring cells and component 1608 broadcasts subband load metrics to served UEs. Component 1610 receives subband load metrics from adjacent ceils. Component 1612 determines if the subband assignment for a served UE is loaded in an adjacent cell. 1614 is a component for reducing power spectral density for the UE when the subband assignment for a served UE is loaded in an adjacent cell while 1616 is a component for maintaining UE power spectral density and is used if the subband assignment for a served UE is not loaded in an adjacent cell. 1618 serves as a data store.<br>
[00117]	FIG. 17 illustrates a UE based communication system 1700. 1702 is a<br>
component for receiving subband load metric information from adjacent cells.  1704 is a component for determining the source of adjacent subband load metrics (e.g. directly from the adjacent cell, from the serving cell through the backhaul charmel).  1706 is a component for determining the loaded/not loaded state of the subband load metrics.<br>
 <br>
Component 1708 is a component for reducing assigned transmit power spectral density for UE for which it has been determined that the assigned subband is loaded in an adjacent cell. Component 1710 maintains an assigned transmit power spectral density. 712 serves as a data store.<br>
[00118]	It can be readily appreciated from the foregoing that by sub-dividing<br>
bandwidth into respective sub-bands a more granular tuning of UE power-level can be<br>
achieved as compared to conventional schemes. As a result, overall system resource<br>
utilization as well as inter-cell interference mitigation is facilitated.<br>
