				<td>Process for the epoxidation of propene<br>
The invention is directed to an improved process for the<br>
continuous epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide in<br>
the presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a<br>
methanol solvent, wherein the catalyst is periodically<br>
regenerated by washing with methanol and the epoxidation<br>
reaction is carried out for periods of more than 300 h<br>
between two regeneration steps.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide and a<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst is known from EP-A 0 100 118<br>
and from M.G.Clerici et al., Journal of Catalysis, Vol.<br>
129, pages 159 to 167. M.G.Clerici et al. disclose that in<br>
this reaction catalytic activity decreases with time on<br>
stream and that titanium silicalite may be regenerated by<br>
washing with solvents somewhat above reaction temperature.<br>
Suitable solvents are methanol or the. solvent that is used<br>
in the reaction. It is also stated that fresh and recovered<br>
catalysts have similar activity and physical-chemical<br>
properties. However, no information is given on the<br>
deactivation behaviour of catalysts that were regenerated<br>
by washing with solvents.<br>
JP-A 03-114 536 describes the regeneration of a titanium<br>
silicalite catalyst that was deactivated in an epoxidation<br>
reaction by washing with a solvent at a temperature that is<br>
5 to 150°C higher than the temperature used in the<br>
epoxidation reaction. Examples 4 and 5 disclose the<br>
regeneration of a catalyst that was used for the<br>
epoxidation of allyl chloride by washing with methanol at<br>
70 and 85°C. No information is given on the deactivation<br>
behaviour of catalysts that were regenerated by washing<br>
with solvents.<br><br>
EP-A 1 190 770 discloses a method for regenerating a<br>
titanium silicalite that has been used as an epoxidation<br>
catalyst by washing with a solvent containing a source of<br>
ammonium and/or alkali metal ions at a temperature of at<br>
least 150°C. The presence of ammonium or alkali metal ions<br>
in the washing solvent has the effect that regenerated<br>
catalysts reach high epoxide selectivities more quickly<br>
■after recommencement of epoxidation. However, no<br>
information is given on the deactivation behaviour of<br>
catalysts that were regenerated by washing with a solvent.<br>
7<br>
The use of a solvent containing ammonium or alkali metal<br>
ions also has the disadvantage that a recovery of the<br>
solvent from the regeneration effluents will be more<br>
difficult.<br>
EP-A 1 190 770 also teaches that, if propene is epoxidized<br>
and the reaction temperature is raised to compensate for<br>
the deactivation of the catalyst while a constant pressure<br>
is maintained, such temperature rise will lead to a<br>
decrease in propene oxide selectivity. In order to keep the<br>
propene oxide selectivity constant the pressure has to be<br>
raised during the temperature rise in such a manner as to<br>
maintain a constant propene concentration in the reaction<br>
mixture. The epoxidation process disclosed in EP-A<br>
1 190 770 therefore has the disadvantage that a constant<br>
product selectivity can only be achieved if the reaction<br>
mixture is permanently monitored for the propene content.<br>
The inventors of this application have investigated the<br>
methods of regenerating titanium silicalite catalysts which<br>
have been used for the epoxidation of propene by washing<br>
them with a solvent and have investigated the use of such<br>
regenerated catalysts in the continuous epoxidation of<br>
propene for extended periods of time. During these<br>
observations, they observed the hitherto unknown effect<br>
that regenerated catalysts frequently showed a much faster<br>
loss of catalytic activity compared with the freshly<br><br>
prepared catalyst, although the initial activity and<br>
selectivity as well as the physical-chemical properties of<br>
the regenerated catalyst and the fresh catalyst were<br>
essentially the same.<br>
Therefore, there was a need to improve the process for<br>
continuous epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide<br>
and a titanium silicalite catalyst with a catalyst<br>
regeneration by washing with a solvent in such a way, that<br>
the regenerated catalyst can be used for a longer period of<br>
time between regeneration steps and at the same time to<br>
overcome the disadvantages known from EP-A 1 190 770.<br>
Subject of the invention<br>
This object is attained by a process for the continuous<br>
epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide in the<br>
presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a methanol<br>
solvent, wherein the catalyst is periodically regenerated<br>
in a regeneration step by washing with a methanol solvent<br>
and wherein regeneration of the catalyst is carried out at<br>
a temperature of at least 100°C and epoxidation is carried<br>
out for periods of at least 300 h between two regeneration<br>
steps.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the process of the<br>
invention not only permits to operate the continuous<br>
epoxidation reaction with a regenerated catalyst for a long<br>
time period, but also that high catalyst selectivity is<br>
achieved shortly after the regeneration step without the<br>
need to add sources for ammonium or alkali metal ions and<br>
that the epoxidation process can be operated at essentially<br>
constant hydrogen peroxide conversion and product<br>
selectivity by raising the reaction temperature to<br>
compensate for catalyst deactivation without the need for<br>
adjusting the reaction pressure.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is directed to an improved process for the<br>
continuous epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide in<br>
the presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a<br>
methanol solvent, wherein the catalyst is periodically<br>
regenerated by washing with methanol and the epoxidation<br>
reaction is carried out for periods of more than 300 h<br>
between two regeneration steps.<br>
For economic reasons it is preferred for an industrial<br>
scale process to use propene not in a pure form but as a<br>
technical mixture with propane that as a rule contains 1 to<br>
15 vol.% of propane. Propene may be fed as a liquid as well<br>
as in gaseous form into the epoxidation reaction.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is preferably used in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution with a hydrogen peroxide content of 1 to<br>
90 wt.%, preferably 10 to 80 wt.% and particularly<br>
preferably 30 to 70 wt.%. The hydrogen peroxide may be<br>
used in the form of a commercially available, stabilised<br>
solution. Also suitable are unstabilised, aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide solutions such as are obtained in the<br>
anthraquinone process for producing hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide solutions in methanol which are obtained<br>
by reacting hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a noble<br>
metal catalyst in a methanol solvent may also be used.<br>
Titanium silicalites are crystalline, titanium-containing<br>
zeolites preferably of the composition (Ti02) X (Si02) i-x where<br>
x is from 0.001 to 0.05 having a MFI or MEL crystalline<br>
structure. Such catalysts may be produced for example<br>
according to the process described in US-A 4,410,501. The<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst is preferably employed as a<br>
shaped catalyst in the form of granules, extrudates or<br>
shaped bodies. For the forming process the catalyst may<br><br>
contain 1 to 99% of a binder or carrier material, all<br>
binders and carrier materials being suitable that do not<br>
react with hydrogen peroxide or with the epoxide under the<br>
reaction conditions employed for the epoxidation.<br>
Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm are preferably used<br>
as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
The methanol solvent used in the epoxidation reaction<br>
preferably comprises more than 90 wt.% methanol and more<br>
preferably more than 97 wt.% methanol. The methanol solvent<br>
is preferably a technical grade methanol, a solvent stream<br>
recovered in the work-up of the epoxidation reaction<br>
mixture or a mixture of both.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide, propene and the methanol solvent may be<br>
introduced into the epoxidation reactor as independent<br>
feeds or one or more of these feeds may be mixed prior to<br>
introduction into the reactor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention an additional<br>
base, preferably ammonia, is fed to the epoxidation reactor<br>
to control the__se 1 ectiyity of the catalyst. The base may be<br>
added separately or admixed to one of the above feeds to<br>
the reactor. The addition of the base may be at a constant<br>
rate. Alternatively, the base may be added to one of the<br>
feeds to the reactor in such an amount as to maintain a<br>
constant pH in the feed stream the base is added to.<br>
In the epoxidation reaction propene is preferably employed<br>
in excess relative to the hydrogen peroxide in order to<br>
achieve a significant consumption of hydrogen peroxide, the<br>
molar ratio of propene to hydrogen peroxide preferably<br>
being chosen in the range from 1.1 to 30. The methanol<br>
solvent is preferably used in the epoxidation in a weight<br>
ratio of 0.5 to 20 relative to the amount of hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution. The amount of catalyst employed may be<br>
varied within wide limits and is preferably chosen so that<br>
a hydrogen peroxide consumption of more than 90%,<br><br>
preferably more than 95%, is achieved within 1 minute to<br>
5 hours under the employed epoxidation reaction conditions.<br>
During the epoxidation the pressure within the reactor is<br>
usually maintained at 0,5 to 5 MPa, preferably 1,5 to<br>
3,5 MPa.<br>
The epoxidation of propene is typically carried out at a<br>
temperature of 30 to 80°C, preferably at 40 to 60°C.<br>
The epoxidation is preferably carried out in a fixed bed<br>
reactor by passing a mixture comprising propene, hydrogen<br>
peroxide and methanol over the catalyst fixed bed. The<br>
fixed bed reactor is preferably equipped with cooling means<br>
and cooled with a liquid cooling medium. The temperature<br>
profile within this reactor is preferably maintained such<br>
that the cooling medium temperature of the cooling means is<br>
at least 40°C and the maximum temperature within the<br>
catalyst bed is 60°C at the most, preferably 55°C.<br>
When using a fixed bed reactor, the epoxidation reaction<br>
mixture is preferably passed through the catalyst bed in<br>
down flow mode, preferably with a superficial velocity from<br>
1 to 100 m/h, more preferably 5 to 50 m/h, most preferred 5<br>
to 30 m/h. The superficial velocity is defined as the ratio<br>
of volume flow rate/cross section of the catalyst bed.<br>
Additionally it is preferred to pass the reaction mixture<br>
through the catalyst bed with a liquid hourly space<br>
velocity (LHSV) from 1 to 20 h"1, preferably 1.3 to 15 h"1.<br>
It is particularly preferred to maintain the catalyst bed<br>
in a trickle bed state during the epoxidation reaction.<br>
Suitable conditions for maintaining the trickle bed state<br>
during the epoxidation reaction are disclosed in<br>
WO 02/085873 on page 8 line 23 to page 9 line 15.<br>
In order to be able to operate the epoxidation process<br>
continuously when changing and/or regenerating the<br>
epoxidation catalyst, two or more flow reactors may if<br><br>
desired also be operated in parallel or in series in the<br>
before-described manner.<br>
During the continuous oxidation of propene the titanium<br>
silicalite catalyst slowly loses catalytic activity. When<br>
the activity of the catalyst drops below the desired level<br>
the epoxidation reaction is interrupted and the catalyst is<br>
regenerated by washing with a methanol solvent at a<br>
temperature of at least 100°C. Regeneration is preferably<br>
performed at a temperature from 100 to 200°C for a period<br>
of 0.5 to 48 hours, more preferably 2 to 24 hours and most<br>
preferably 4 to 10 hours.<br>
When a fixed bed catalyst is used, the catalyst is<br>
preferably regenerated inside the epoxidation reactor<br>
without removing it from the reactor by passing a flow of<br>
methanol solvent through the catalyst fixed bed. Preferably<br>
the methanol solvent stream is passed through the catalyst<br>
bed in down flow mode and most preferably the flow rate is<br>
adjusted to maintain a trickle flow in the catalyst bed.<br>
Suitable conditions for maintaining a trickle flow mode are<br>
disclosed in WO 02/085873 on page 8, line 23 to page 9,<br>
line 15.<br>
Regeneration may be performed at a constant temperature or<br>
using a temperature program. When a fixed bed catalyst is<br>
regenerated, passing the methanol solvent over the fixed<br>
bed is preferably started at the temperature used for the<br>
epoxidation reaction. The temperature is then raised to at<br>
least 100°C and maintained at a temperature of at least<br>
100°C for the time necessary to carry out regeneration.<br>
Thereafter, the temperature is lowered back to the<br>
temperature used for epoxidation. Finally the methanol flow<br>
is stopped or the epoxidation is recommenced by starting to<br>
feed propene and hydrogen peroxide to the reactor. In such<br>
a temperature program, raising and lowering of the<br>
temperature is preferably performed at a rate of from 5 K/h<br>
to 30 K/h.<br><br>
During regeneration with a methanol solvent the pressure is<br>
adjusted to maintain the major part of the methanol solvent<br>
in the liquid state. The necessary pressure may be attained<br>
as the autogenous vapour pressure by evaporating part of<br>
the methanol solvent or by supplying an inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen.<br>
When a fixed bed catalyst is regenerated by passing a<br>
methanol solvent stream through the catalyst fixed bed, at<br>
least a part of the solvent that is passed through the<br>
catalyst fixed bed may be reused for regenerating the<br>
catalyst without prior purification. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the methanol solvent is passed<br>
through the catalyst fixed bed without reuse for a period<br>
of from 2 % to 30 % of the time used for regeneration.<br>
Thereafter, all the methanol solvent that is passed through<br>
the catalyst fixed bed is returned to the regeneration,<br>
creating a closed loop for washing the catalyst with a<br>
methanol solvent for the remainder of regeneration time. In<br>
this embodiment of the invention the amount of methanol<br>
needed for regenerating the catalyst is considerably<br>
reduced.<br>
The methanol solvent used for regenerating the catalyst<br>
preferably comprises more than 90 % methanol and less then<br>
10 % water and more preferably more than 97 wt.-% methanol<br>
and less than 3 % water. The methanol solvent is preferably<br>
a technical grade methanol, a solvent stream recovered in<br>
the work-up of the epoxidation reaction mixture or a<br>
mixture of both.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the reaction<br>
mixture from the epoxidation reaction is worked up by a<br>
sequence comprising a depressurising step removing part of<br>
the propene, followed by a pre-separation which separates<br>
the mixture from the depressurising step into an overhead<br>
product comprising propene, propene oxide and a minor part<br>
of the methanol contained in the mixture and a bottom<br><br>
product comprising the major part of the methanol contained<br>
in the mixture, water and high boiling by-products. The<br>
bottom product from the pre-separation is then subjected to<br>
a hydrogenation step and the hydrogenated steam is<br>
subjected to a distillation step to give an overhead<br>
product containing more than 90 wt.-% and more preferably<br>
97 wt.-% methanol. This overhead product is preferably used<br>
as the methanol solvent for regenerating the catalyst.<br>
The used methanol solvent obtained from the step of<br>
regenerating the catalyst may be passed to a process stage<br>
for working up the reaction mixture of the epoxidation<br>
reaction to recover the methanol contained therein. When<br>
the preferred embodiment for working up the reaction<br>
mixture of the epoxidation reaction as described in the<br>
paragraph above is used, the methanol solvent that was used<br>
for regenerating the catalyst is preferably passed either<br>
to the hydrogenation stage or to the subsequent<br>
distillation step.<br>
After the catalyst has been regenerated by washing with the<br>
methanol solvent the continuous epoxidation of propene is<br>
recommenced and the epoxidation is carried out for a period<br>
of at least 300 hours before the next regeneration step is<br>
performed. Preferably the epoxidation is carried out for a<br>
period of from 500 to 8000 hours between to regeneration<br>
steps, more preferably for a period of from 1000 to 4000<br>
hours and most preferably for a period of from 1500 to 2500<br>
hours. The ratio of the time period used for epoxidation<br>
between two regeneration steps relative to the time period<br>
of a regeneration step is preferably at least 100 and more<br>
preferably from 100 to 300.<br>
In between two regeneration steps the epoxidation reaction<br>
is preferably operated to maintain an essentially constant<br>
hydrogen peroxide conversion. In this context, essentially<br>
constant has the meaning that hydrogen peroxide conversion<br>
. varies by no more than 2 % at a given reactant feed.<br><br>
However, if reactant feeds are changed to achieve a<br>
different production rate, hydrogen peroxide conversion may<br>
change by a larger value than 2 %, but thereafter will be<br>
maintained within 2 % of the new value. In order to<br>
maintain an essentially constant hydrogen peroxide<br>
conversion while the catalyst looses activity through<br>
deactivation, reaction parameters, such as temperature or<br>
pressure, have to be adjusted. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the pressure during the epoxidation is<br>
maintained constant and the reaction temperature for the<br>
epoxidation is raised at a rate of 0.025 K/h or less to<br>
compensate for catalyst deactivation and maintain an<br>
essentially constant hydrogen peroxide conversion.<br>
The following examples illustrate the process of the<br>
invention and the improvement over the prior art achieved<br>
by the process of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Titanium silicalite was used in the form of extrudates with<br>
2 mm diameter shaped with silica sol as a binder as<br>
described in example 5 of EP-A 1 138 387.<br>
	 ---'- »<br>
H2O2 was used as a 60 wt-% solution that was prepared from<br>
an aqueous solution obtained in the extraction step of an<br>
anthraquinone process by evaporation of water without<br>
further purification. The 60 wt-% H2O2 was adjusted with<br>
1100 ppm ammonia to a pH of 4.5 before feeding it to the<br>
epoxidation. pH values were measured with a glass electrode<br>
without correction.<br>
Reaction products were analysed by gas chromatography and<br>
H2O2 conversion was determined by redox titration. The<br>
catalyst H2O2 selectivity was calculated as the ratio of<br>
the amount of propene oxide formed relative to the amount<br>
of H202 converted.<br><br>
Example 1 (comparative example)<br>
Epoxidation of propene was carried out continuously in a<br>
tubular reactor of 300 ml volume, a diameter of 10 mm and a<br>
length of 4 m, equipped with a cooling jacket. The reactor<br>
was filled with a titanium silicalite catalyst in the form<br>
of 2 mm extrudates made with a silica sol binder according<br>
to example 5 of EP-A 1 138 387. The reactor was operated in<br>
down-flow operation mode. The equipment furthermore<br>
comprised of three feed containers and pumps for the liquid<br>
starting materials and a liquid-gas separating vessel for<br>
collecting the reaction mixture. Reaction temperature was<br>
controlled by circulating an aqueous coolant through the<br>
cooling jacket whereby the coolant temperature was<br>
controlled by a thermostat. Reactor pressure was kept at<br>
2.5 MPa absolute with nitrogen gas and a pressure<br>
controller. The feed containers were charged with methanol,<br>
the 60 wt-% H2O2 solution and liquid propene. Mass flow of<br>
the feeding pumps was adjusted to result in a propene feed<br>
concentration of 43 wt-%, a methanol feed concentration of<br>
43 wt-% and a H2O2 feed concentration of 8.4 wt-% at a<br>
total flow of 0.35 kg/h. The cooling jacket temperature was<br>
initially adjusted to 41°C. Initial H202 conversion was<br>
96 % at a catalyst H202 selectivity of 88 %. During 2500 h<br>
running time of the epoxidation process the coolant<br>
temperature was increased to 50°C to maintain the H2O2<br>
conversion constant at 95 %. After 2500 h of operation the<br>
catalyst H2O2 selectivity had dropped to 85 %. The product<br>
mixture contained 2.7 mol-% of methoxypropanols and<br>
2.5 mol-% 1.2-propylene glycol with respect to the amount<br>
of propene oxide.<br>
After 2500 h the reaction feed was stopped and the catalyst<br>
was regenerated by feeding to the reactor 0.35 kg/h of a<br>
1 wt.-% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in down-flow<br>
mode for a period of 4 h at a temperature of 50°C.<br><br>
After the regeneration procedure the feed was again changed<br>
to the reaction mixture described above and the epoxidation<br>
process was continued as described above with an initial<br>
cooling jacket temperature of 41°C. After 48 h reaction<br>
time the H2O2 conversion was 95,5 % at a catalyst H2O2<br>
selectivity of 87 %. The product mixture contained<br>
2.6 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 1.9 mol-% 1.2-propylene<br>
glycol with respect to the amount of propene oxide.<br>
Example 2 (comparative example)<br>
The epoxidation of propene was carried out as described in<br>
example 1.<br>
After 2500 h the reaction feed was stopped and the catalyst<br>
was regenerated as described in EP-A 0 790 075 by feeding<br>
to the reactor 10 Nl/h nitrogen gas in down-flow mode for a<br>
period of 24 h at a temperature of 250°C.<br>
After the regeneration procedure the epoxidation process<br>
was continued as described in example 1. After 48 h<br>
reaction time the H2O2 conversion was 95,2 % at a catalyst<br>
H202 selectivity of 87 %. The product mixture contained<br>
2.6 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 2.1 mol-% 1.2-propylene<br>
glycol with respect to the amount of propene oxide.<br>
Example 3 (comparative example)<br>
The epoxidation of propene was carried out as described in<br>
example 1.<br>
After 2500 h the reaction feed was stopped and	the catalyst<br>
was regenerated by feeding to the reactor 0.35	kg/h pure<br>
methanol in down-flow mode for a period of 4 h	at a<br>
temperature of 71°C.<br><br>
After the regeneration procedure the epoxidation process<br>
was continued as described in example 1. After 48 h<br>
reaction time the H202 conversion was 93,8 % at a catalyst<br>
H202 selectivity of 8 9 %. The product mixture contained<br>
2.2 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 1.0 mol-% 1.2-propylene<br>
glycol with respect to the amount of propene oxide.<br>
After the regeneration step, the coolant temperature had to<br>
be increased to 49°C over a period of 271 h to maintain a<br>
constant H202 conversion in the epoxidation process. After<br>
271 h reaction time the H202 conversion was 93,9 % at a<br>
catalyst H202 selectivity of 88 %. The product mixture<br>
contained 2.5 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 1.7 mol-%<br>
1.2-propylene glycol with respect to the amount of propene<br>
oxide.<br>
Example 4<br>
The epoxidation of propene was carried out as described in<br>
example 1.<br>
After 2500 h the reaction feed was stopped and the catalyst<br>
was regenerated by feeding to the reactor 0.35 kg/h pure<br>
methanol in down-flow mode for a period of 4 h at a<br>
temperature of 150°C.<br>
After the regeneration procedure the epoxidation process<br>
was continued as described in example 1. After 58 h<br>
reaction time the H202 conversion was 95,8 % at a catalyst<br>
H202 selectivity of 90 %. The product mixture contained<br>
2.1 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 0.9 mol-% 1.2-propylene<br>
glycol with respect to the amount of propene oxide.<br>
After the regeneration step, the coolant temperature had to<br>
be increased to 44°C over a period of 328 h to maintain a<br>
constant H202 conversion in the epoxidation process. After<br>
328 h reaction time the H202 conversion was 94,9 % at a<br><br>
catalyst H202 selectivity of 90 %. The product mixture<br>
contained 1.9 mol-% of methoxypropanols and 1.0 mol-%<br>
1.2-propylene glycol with respect to the amount of propene<br>
oxide.<br>
Example 4 shows that by selecting the solvent and<br>
temperature according to the invention, the time on stream<br>
of the regenerated catalyst in the epoxidation of propene<br>
can be considerably prolonged before another regeneration<br>
treatment becomes necessary. In example 4, the reaction<br>
temperature had to be raised by 3 K over a 27 0 h period<br>
(0.011 K/h) to compensate for the loss in catalyst<br>
activity, whereas in example 3 the temperature had to be<br>
raised by 8 K in a shorter 230 h period (0.035 K/h),<br>
indicating a reduced loss of catalyst activity over time<br>
when the epoxidation process is operated according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The results also show, that by selecting the solvent and<br>
temperature according to the invention, a high catalyst<br>
H2O2 selectivity and low levels of by-products<br>
methoxypropanols and 1,2-propylene glycol are reached after<br>
the regeneration within a short time period of 58 h without<br>
the need for additives in the washing solvent as described<br>
in EP-A 1 190 770.<br>
Example 4 demonstrates that in the process according to the<br>
invention a low level of by-products is maintained for a<br>
long period after the catalyst was regenerated, whereas<br>
regeneration at a lower temperature leads to increasing by-<br>
product levels when the regenerated catalyst is used over<br>
an extended period as can be seen from example 3. This<br>
proves that in the process according to the invention the<br>
regenerated catalyst shows a reduced loss of catalyst<br>
selectivity.<br><br>
With the process according to the invention a high<br>
selectivity can also be maintained while the reaction<br>
temperature is raised to compensate for catalyst<br>
deactivation without the need for raising the pressure as<br>
for the process of EP-A 1 190 770. This facilitates process<br>
control because there is no need to measure the amount of<br>
propene in the liquid phase of the reaction mixture,<br>
whereas the process of EP-A 1 190 770 requires such<br>
measurement to adjust the pressure for maintaining a<br>
constant propene concentration.<br><br>
