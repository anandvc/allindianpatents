The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
-WO £003/04614T	PCT/U92004/036839<br>
METHOD ANfTSPF^RATUS FOR POLICY CONTROL ENHANCEMENT IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM-<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/517,454<br>
filed November 4, 2003, entitled "3GPP2 Policy Control Enhancement," by AC Mahendran et al., bearing Atty. Docket No. 040064P1, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and, more<br>
specifically, to a method and apparatus for policy control enhancement in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
(0003]	Wireless communication technologies have seen explosive growth over the past<br>
several years. This growth has been primarily fueled by wireless services providing freedom of movement to the communicating public as opposed to being "tethered" to a hard-wired communication system. It has further been fueled by the increasing quality and speed of voice and data communications over the wireless medium, among other factors. As a result of these enhancements in the communications field, wireless communications has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on a growing number of die communicating public.<br>
[0004]	Typically, a mobile station communicating in a wireless communication system<br>
is afforded various types of communication services, which may include SP-based services, stream-based (streaming) services, among other types of services. The mobile station will usually generate a resource reservation request for a particular communication service, and the resource request is either accepted or rejected based upon policy control as determined by a policy decision function (PDF) that is specific to the type of service requested by the mobile station. The policy decision function will typically make a policy decision on the mobile station's resource request based at least in part upon a user profile associated with the mobile station making the resource request and network policy.  Generally, however, the policy decision function does not<br><br>
WO 2005/046147	PCTI/US2004/036839<br>
•2-<br>
have direct access to the user profile of the mobile station making the resource request<br>
since it is usually not involved in the user authentication process.<br>
[0005]	The resource request generated by the mobile station is typically received at a<br>
packet data serving node (PDSN), which forwards the resource request to a policy decision function (PDF) that makes a policy decision of whether to grant the resource request to the mobile station. As mentioned, each policy decision function is service-specific, and only makes policy decisions for resource requests of a specific type of communication service that it handles. For example, a mobile station may request a certain amount of bandwidth allocation from the wireless communication system for a streaming service. The policy control for the allocation of bandwidth for streaming service is handled by a particular policy decision function of the network; whereas another policy decision function may handle resource requests for another type of communication service (such as SIP-based services, for example).<br>
[0006]	A problem that occurs is that the packet data serving node is typically ignorant<br>
of the communication resource request service type requested by the mobile station. Consequently, the packet data serving node is not aware of which policy decision function to contact to handle the specific type of resource request initiated by the mobile station, which may decrease the expediency in which the resource request is handled. Another problem that exists is that, since the policy decision function needs to obtain the requesting mobile station's user profile to make a policy decision, the PDF's poKcy decision on the mobile's resource request may be impeded as a result of not having direct access to the mobile's user profile because the PDF is not involved in the user authentication process.<br>
[0007]	The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing the effects<br>
of, one or more problems indicated above.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	In one aspect of the invention, a method in a wireless communication system is<br>
provided. The method comprises generating a resource request for a communication service, the resource request including an identifier uniquely identifying a type of communication service and receiving the resource request for the communication service. The method further includes selecting a policy control entity to process the resource request, the selecting being based at least on the identifier, and performing policy control by the selected policy control entity on the resource request.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
(0019]	Turning now to the drawings, and specifically referring to FIG. 1, a wireless<br>
communication system 100 is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The wireless communication system 100 comprises a plurality of mobile stations (MS) 105 that communicate wim a plurality of base stations (BS) 110, which are geographically dispersed to provide continuous communication coverage with the mobile stations 105 as they traverse the wireless communication system 100.<br>
[0020]	The mobile stations 105 may, for example, take the form of wireless telephones,<br>
personal information mangers (PIMs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, or other types of computer terminals that are configured for wireless communication. The base stations 110 transmit data to the mobile stations 105 over a forward link of a wireless communication channel 115, and the mobile stations 105 transmit data to the base stations 110 over a reverse link of the wireless communication channel 115.<br>
[0021]	In one embodiment, the wireless communication system 100 conforms generally<br>
to a release of the cdma2000 specification. Cdma2000 is a 3rd Generation (3G) wireless communication standard, hi accordance with the illustrated embodiment, me wireless communication system 100 is intended to operate utilizing 3GPP2 (3rd Generation<br><br>
WO 1003/046147	PCT//US2004/036839<br>
6<br>
Partnership Project) Revision D of the cdma2000 standard. In an alternative embodiment, the wireless communication system 100 may operate in accordance with Release 6 of the W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) standard, but other embodiments may be implemented in other releases of the W-CDMA standard. It will be appreciated that the embodiments described herein should be considered as exemplary rather than limiting. Accordingly, the system 100 may take the form of various other types of wireless communication systems without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and, thus, need not necessarily be limited to the aforementioned examples.<br>
[0022]	Each base station 110 is coupled to a base station controller (BSC) 120, which<br>
controls connections between the base stations 110 and other communication system components of the wireless communication system 100. The base stations 110 and the base station controller 120 collectively form a radio access network (RAN) for transporting data to and from the plurality of mobile stations 105 that communicate within the wireless communication system 100. The base stations 110 are coupled to the base station controller 120 by backhaul communication links, which may take the form of wireline El or Tl links. The backhaul communication links, however, may alternatively be embodied using any one of a number of wired or wireless communication mediums including, but not necessarily limited to, microwave, optical fiber, and the like.<br>
[0023]	The simplified depiction of the wireless communication system 100 in FIG. 1 is<br>
merely for ease in conveying the present invention. It will be appreciated that the wireless communication system 100 may be configured with any number of mobile stations 105, base stations 110, and base station controllers 120 without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and, thus, need not necessarily be limited to the example illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0024]	In the illustrated embodiment, the base station controller 120 is coupled to<br>
various communication system components to effectively extend the communication capabilities available to the mobile stations 105 communicating within the wireless communication system 100. The communication system components include a packet data serving node (PDSN) 140, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 150, and the Internet 160 for access by the mobile stations 105 communicating therein. Additionally, the wireless communication system 100 is configured with an Authentication,   Authorization,   and   Accounting   (AAA)   server   170   to   provide<br><br>
WO 2005/046147.	PiET/US2004/036839<br>
authentication and billing services for each of the mobile stations 105 communicating therein- The AAA server 170 maintains a user profile (not shown) for each of the mobile stations 105 communicating in the wireless communication system 100. The user profile includes information on various communication services afforded to the mobile station 105 by the wireless communication system 100, among various other information to provide authentication, authorization and accounting of the mobile station 105 by the AAA server 170. It will be appreciated that the wireless communication system 100 may be interfaced with various other types of communication system components without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Additionally, there may be a connection between the PSTN 150, Internet 160, and AAA server 170 to the BSC 120 directly, as opposed to being coupled to the BSC 120 through the PDSN 140 as illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0025]	Turning now to FIG. 2, a more detailed representation of the mobile station 105<br>
is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In one of its simpler forms, the mobile station 105 comprises a transmitter 205 for transmitting data over the reverse link of the wireless communication channel 115 to the base stations 110. The mobile station 105 also includes a receiver 210 for receiving data that is transmitted from the base stations 110 over the forward link of the wireless communication channel 115. In an alternative embodiment, the transmitter 205 and receiver 210 may be combined into a single transceiver unit as opposed to being embodied as two separate entities as illustrated in the figure. The transmitter 205 and the receiver 210 are coupled to an antenna 215 to facilitate the wireless transmission and reception of data between the mobile station 105 and the base stations 110 over the wireless communication channel 115.<br>
[0026]	The mobile station 105 further comprises a processor 220 for controlling various<br>
operating functions of the mobile station 105 and a memory 225 for storing data. In one embodiment, the processor 220 may take the form of a digital signal processor (DSP) chip. It will be appreciated, however, that the processor 220 may take the form of various other commercially-available processors or controllers.<br>
{0027]	The mobile station 105 also comprises a data input 230, coupled to the processor<br>
220, which provides data for transmission by the mobile station 105 to the base stations 110 over the wireless communication channel 115. The data input 230 may take the form of a microphone or an input from a data generating device, such as a computer terminal, for example.    It will be appreciated that the data input 230 may be<br><br>
WO 2005/046147<br><br>
PCT/US2004/036839<br><br>
implemented in various other forms to provide data to the processor 220, and, thus, need<br>
not necessarily be limited to the aforementioned examples.<br>
[0028]	The data received through the data input 230 is processed by the processor 220<br>
and then forwarded to the transmitter 205 for transmission over the reverse link of the<br>
wireless communication channel 115 to the base stations 110.   Data received by the<br>
receiver 210 over the forward link of the wireless communication channel 115 from the<br>
base stations 110 is forwarded to the processor 220 for processing and then to data<br>
output 235 for presentation to the user of the mobile station 105. The data output 235<br>
may take the form of at least one of a speaker, visual display, and an output to a data<br>
device (e.g., a computer terminal), or any combination thereof. It will be appreciated<br>
that the data output 235 may comprise various other visual or aural perceptible devices,<br>
and, thus, need not necessarily be limited to the aforementioned examples.    The<br>
simplified depiction of the mobile station 105 in FIG. 2 is merely for ease in conveying<br>
the present invention. Accordingly, it will also be appreciated that the mobile station<br>
105 may include other components to enable various other features and/or capabilities<br>
of the mobile station 105 than those illustrated.<br>
[0029]	Referring now to FIG. 3, a more detailed representation of the base station 110 is<br>
shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.     In one of its<br>
simpler forms, the base station 110 comprises a transmitter 305 for transmitting data<br>
over the forward link of the wireless communication channel 115 to the mobile station<br>
105, and a receiver 310 for receiving data that is transmitted from the mobile stations<br>
105 over the reverse link of the wireless communication channel 115. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the transmitter 305 and receiver 310 may be combined into a single<br>
transceiver unit as opposed to being embodied as two separate entities as illustrated.<br>
The transmitter 305 and the receiver 310 are coupled to an antenna 315 to facilitate the<br>
transmission and reception of data between the base station 110 and the mobile station<br>
105 over the wireless communication channel 115.<br>
{0030]	The base station 110 is further configured with a processor 320 for controlling<br>
various operating functions and a memory 325 for storing data. In one embodiment, the<br>
processor 320 may take the form of a digital signal processor (DSP) chip. It will be<br>
appreciated, however, that the processor 320 may take the form of various other<br>
commercially-available processors or controllers without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention. The base station 110 further comprises a communication<br>
interface 340 for interfacing the base station 110 to the base station controller 120. It<br><br>
WO 2005/046747	PCT/US2004/036839<br>
will be appreciated that the base station 110 may be configured with additional components to perform a variety of other functions than those illustrated.<br>
[0031]	Referring back to FIG. 1, the PDSN 140 receives resource reservation requests<br>
for specific types of communication services desired by the mobile stations 105 within the wireless communication system 100. The resource reservation request generated by a particular mobile station 105 may include various types of communication services afforded to the mobile station 105 by the wireless communication system 100. For example, a resource reservation request by the mobile station 105 may include a request for 100 kbps of bandwidth for video. It will be appreciated, however, mat the resource reservation request initiated by the mobile station 105 may include various other types of requests for communication services, and, thus, need not necessarily be limited to the aforementioned example.<br>
[0032]	Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary block diagram of a policy control<br>
architecture for the wireless communication system 100 is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. When a mobile station 105 initiates a resource reservation request for communication services, the PDSN 140 accesses one or more policy decision functions (PDFs) 405 that make a network policy decision on a particular mobile station's resource reservation request The PDFs 405, in accordance with the illustrated embodiment, are configured to make policy decisions on the mobile stations' resource reservation requests based at least in part upon a user profile of the particular mobile station 105 generating the request and on network policy. The PDSN 140 may access different PDFs 405 depending on the type of service (e.g., SIP-based services, streaming-based services, etc.) requested by the mobile station 105 since each PDF 405 is service-specific.<br>
[0033]	Each PDF 405 is associated with at least one application function (AF) 410 for<br>
providing the resource reservation requested by the mobile station 105. The AF 410 does not provide policy control since the AF 410 is typically not provided with access to the user profile of the mobile station 105 and network policy. It will be appreciated that the number of PDFs 405 associated with the PDSN 140 need not necessarily be limited to the example illustrated in FIG. 4. Accordingly, the PDSN 140 may have associated therewith more or fewer PDFs 405 than the two illustrated without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
[0034]	Referring now to FIG. 5, a signaling flow diagram between the mobile station<br>
105 and the components of the policy control architecture (illustrated in FIG. 4) of the<br><br>
•WO 2003/046147	PCT/US2004/036839<br>
10                                                               wireless communication system 100 is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At 505, the mobile station 105 sends a Session Setup Request to the AF 410 that provides resource allocation for the communication service of the resource reservation request desired by the mobile station 105. For example, the mobile station 105 may make a request for 100 kbps of bandwidth for video. Accordingly, in this particular example, the Session Setup Request is sent to the particular application function (AF) 410 that provides the bandwidth allocation for video to the requesting mobile station 105. It will be appreciated, however, that the communication resource reservation request generated by the mobile station 105 may vary, and, thus, need not necessarily be limited to the aforementioned example.<br>
[0035]	In response to receiving the Session Setup Request message from the mobile<br>
station 105, the AF 410 sends a Session Setup In-Progress message to the mobile station 105. In accordance with one embodiment, the Session Setup In-Progress message includes a Service Type, Session DO, and AF address. The Service Type identifies the type of the application service (e.g., SIP-based services, stream-based services, etc.) that is being requested by the mobile station 105. The Session ID is a number chosen by the AF 410 to identify the particular session for the request generated by the mobile station 105. The AF address identifies the particular AF 410 that is configured to handle the request made by the mobile station 105. hi one embodiment, die AF address may take the form of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). In an alternative embodiment, the AF address may take the form of an IP address. It will be appreciated, however, that the AF address need not necessarily be limited to a FQDN or IP address, but may take the form of other address types used to identify the particular AF 410 providing the particular service request without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
[0036]	At 515, the mobile station 105 sends a Bearer Resource Request message to the<br>
PDSN 140. The Bearer Resource Request message includes the Service Type, Session ID, and AF address that was provided to the mobile station 105 by the AF 410 handling the particular service request at 510. As previously mentioned, the PDSN 140 is configured with multiple PDFs 405 that are service-specific for the resource reservation request that is sent from the mobile station 105. Based on the Service Type field in the Bearer Resource Request message sent from the mobile station 105, the PDSN 140 has knowledge of which particular PDF 405 to query for policy control.<br><br>
