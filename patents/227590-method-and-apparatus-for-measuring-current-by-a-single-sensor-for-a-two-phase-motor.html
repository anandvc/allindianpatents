				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to two-phase power devices (such as two-phase<br>
motors) and, more particularly, to an improved procedure for measuring the currents in<br>
each phase of a two - phase motor via a single current sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A two-phase motor (such as a permanent magnet synchronous motor and<br>
induction motor) can be used in many applications to provide power assistance to<br>
mechanical systems. It is known to control the phase winding voltages in a two-phase<br>
motor using pulse width modulated signals. The pulse width modulated signals are<br>
applied to an inverter or a series of switching devices that connect the phase windings<br>
of the motor to a positive and negative terminal of a direct current (DC) power supply,<br>
such as a battery. This inverter consists of four switches in an upper bank and four<br>
switches in a lower bank.<br>
To adequately control the motor and minimize torque ripple, it is necessary to<br>
measure the current flowing through each phase winding. The current measured in<br>
each phase is provided to a controller that generates the pulse width modulated<br>
signals. To measure currents, it is known to use a resistor in series with each phase<br>
winding. The voltage drop across each resistor is measured to determine the current<br>
flowing for each phase. This type of system has the disadvantage of requiring two<br>
current sensors, one for each of the two phase windings, and two measurement<br>
circuits. These existing configurations use either Hall Effect sensors or shunts, which<br>
are expensive. Moreover, Hall Effect sensors have differing response characteristics<br>
due to sensor accuracy, amplification offset, gain and linearity, and temperature and<br>
aging drift, which will cause a mismatch between the two current channels which<br>
generates torque ripple. This is also true for shunts or any other current sensor that<br>
requires an amplification stage. Further, there is an issue with common-mode noise<br>
rejection in two-phase motors that is not addressed.<br><br>
It is also known to use a single resistor to perform the function of measuring<br>
the current through each phase of a Y-connected three-phase motor. The single<br>
resistor is located external to the motor windings on the DC link between the DC<br>
power supply and the inverter or series of switching devices. Depending on the states<br>
of the switches and period of operation, the currents through the phases may be<br>
measured or calculated by the single resistor. Specifically, in a Y-connected three-<br>
phase motor, the sum of all currents flowing through all phases of the motor are zero,<br>
so by knowing the current flowing through one or two phases a determination of the<br>
current flowing through the remaining phase(s) may be made (with the exception of<br>
Y-connected motors with a grounded center point or a motor with a fault). However,<br>
this solution is not applicable to two-phase motors without a common winding<br>
connection.<br>
It is also known to close either the upper bank of switching devices or the<br>
lower bank of switching devices, thereby recirculating the current in the windings of<br>
the motor together when damping or braking is required. Braking is used to damp<br>
unwanted mechanical system oscillations and is also used to reduce the speed of the<br>
mechanical system. For example, mechanical resonances or disturbances may feed<br>
back into the motor from the mechanical system. Not only are unstable mechanical<br>
resonances undesired by themselves, these resonances can generating an electromotive<br>
force (EMF) that can result in excess current in the motor. In damping mode, the<br>
closed switches allow current to circulate within the motor windings to act as a brake<br>
to oppose any motion induced by the mechanical resonances, thereby helping to<br>
restore stability. However, the internal circulation of currents within the motor<br>
windings in this mode cannot be measured by a single external resistor since the<br>
resistor is not in a current carrying loop. Therefore, the currents within the motor<br>
windings cannot be measured, and therefore cannot be modified or controlled.<br>
Recent advances in digital signal processors (DSPs) have permitted the use of<br>
more advanced pulse width modulation schemes such as space vector pulse width<br>
modulation (hereinafter "SVPWM"). One significant advantage of using SVPWM in<br>
a 3-phase system is that it can provide more output voltage compared to<br>
conventionally known sinusoidal pulse width modulation schemes. The drawback,<br>
however, is that SVPWM requires more complex schemes to generate PWM signals<br><br>
applied to the inverter. The main challenge into measuring full phase currents via a<br>
single DC link current sensor is that there are situations where the full phase currents<br>
cannot be sampled during SVPWM operation. One situation is when the amplitude of<br>
the voltage space vector is very small. Another situation is when the voltage space<br>
vector falls on the other active vector.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for an improved technique to monitor current in a<br>
two-phase device, using a single current sensor. It would also be of benefit if<br>
common-mode noise rejection can be provided. Further, it would be desirable to<br>
provide this technique with no additional hardware requirements, thereby improving<br>
reliability and saving cost.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
What is described is an improved procedure for measuring the electric current<br>
flowing through each phase of a two-phase device in a system, using a single external<br>
current sensor. Advantageously, no additional hardware is needed to implement the<br>
invention. Because the sensor is located in the DC link current path, there is no<br>
common-mode noise rejection issue. Two-phase motors, such as permanent magnet<br>
synchronous motors, may be used as part of a powered mechanical system. For<br>
purposes of illustration and description, an example of an application of the procedure<br>
for a two-phase motor for automotive uses will be used. Two-phase motors, such as<br>
permanent magnet synchronous motors, may be used as part of a power steering<br>
system in an automobile. The present invention, however, is not limited to two-phase<br>
motors and may be applicable to other two-phase devices or even multi-phase devices<br>
not sharing a common winding connection, such as two DC motors, for example.<br>
Now, turning to the drawings, an example use of a system for a two-phase<br>
motor will be explained. Referring to FIG. 1, there is a system 20 having generally a<br>
power source 22, an inverter or switching circuit 24, and a motor 26. For automotive<br>
use, the power source 22 may be an automobile DC battery having a positive terminal<br>
28 and a negative terminal 30. The negative terminal 30 may also be a ground<br>
connection. The motor 26 may be a motor having two uncoupled phase windings W1<br>
and W2 driving the motor ninety degrees out of phase, although it should be<br>
recognized that each winding may include a plurality of poles and could also drive the<br>
motor at various angular relationships. It should also be recognized that the present<br>
invention can also be applied to multiple winding motors not sharing a common<br><br>
connection or neutral. Such motors may include, for example, a permanent magnet<br>
synchronous motor or an induction motor.<br>
The inverter or switching circuit 24 includes four sets of switching devices,<br>
one set for each end of each phase winding of the motor 26. A first set of switching<br>
devices Sah (switch A high), Sal (switch A low) are capable of providing a voltage Va<br>
to one side the first phase winding W1, and a second set of switching devices Sbh<br>
(switch B high), Sal (switch B low) are capable of providing a voltage Vb to the other<br>
side the first phase winding W1. The drive to winding W1 is then Va-Vb, or Vab.<br>
Similarly, a third set of switching devices Sch (switch C high), Sc1 (switch C low) are<br>
capable of providing a voltage Vc to one side the second phase winding W2, and a<br>
fourth set of switching devices Sdh (switch D high), Sd1 (switch D low) are capable of<br>
providing a voltage Vd to the other side the first phase winding W2. The drive to<br>
winding W2 is then Vc-Vd, or Vcd. Both upper and lower devices on the same<br>
inverter leg are not allowed to turn-on simultaneously to prevent shoot-through<br>
current. For example, Sah (switch A high) and Sal (switch A low) are never turned on<br>
together. Typically, the amplitude of Va and Vc (or Vb and Vd) is about V batt when<br>
the corresponding upper device is turn-on and OV when the corresponding lower<br>
device is turn-on. Therefore, the amplitude of Vab and Vcd are about either V batt or<br>
zero volts. The amplitude of Vab and Vcd shown in the figures is just an example.<br>
For a 2-phase AC motor, the 2 windings have been driven by sinusoidal voltages.<br>
Each set of switching devices has an upper bank of switching device Sah, Sbh,<br>
Sch, Sdh connected to the positive terminal 28 of the power source 22 and a lower<br>
bank of switching device Sa1, Sb1, Sc1, Sd1 connected to the negative terminal 30 of<br>
the power source 22. Each switching device is independently driven by a PWM<br>
controller 34. The opening and closing of switching devices within each set allows<br>
each end of phase winding W1 and W2 of the motor 26 to be connected to a positive<br>
terminal 28 or a negative terminal 30 of the power supply 22. This permits a voltage<br>
Vab or Vcd to be applied to a corresponding phase winding W1 or W2 of the motor<br>
26, respectively. The current flowing through each phase winding W1 or W2 is<br>
represented in FIG. 1 by a corresponding variable i1 or i2, respectively.<br>
As will be explained in more detail below, the present invention uses SVPWM<br>
signals to control the switching devices. The PWM controller 34 is used to generate a<br><br>
PWM signal to each of the switching devices. The controller 34 generates the PWM<br>
signal based on the current measurements provided by a current sensor 32. It should<br>
be recognized that the current sensor 32 can be associated with amplifiers, sample &amp;<br>
hold circuitry, analog-to-digital converters, and the like in order to provide an analog<br>
or digital signal to the controller indicating a current in the measured phase of the<br>
motor 26. The controller 34 can include a digital processor and memory to store<br>
software having control algorithms. The digital processor supplies the PWM signals<br>
based the control algorithms implemented in software. A suitable controller 34<br>
having a digital processor for the present invention may be obtained from Motorola,<br>
Inc. as part of the 56F83xx family, for example. The part is a digital signal processor<br>
(DSP) controller that includes flash memory to store software. Alternatively, the<br>
controller 34 could include a DSP processor with an external memory (not shown).<br>
A variety of switching devices can be used for the switching circuit 24. For<br>
example, the switching devices can be power transistors such as IGBT, power<br>
MOSFET, and bipolar transistor. The PWM signals would then be applied to the<br>
gates or bases of the power transistors. What is important is that each switching<br>
device is capable of being opened or closed (or turned off or on) by applying a PWM<br>
signal. The switches are generally controlled by a PWM signal but most important,<br>
they are generating the PWM phase voltage to the motor windings.<br>
To adequately control the motor 26 and minimize torque ripple, the currents<br>
for variables i 1 and i2 need to be measured or otherwise known. In one embodiment,<br>
the single current sensing device 32 is positioned on the DC link between the power<br>
supply 22 and the switching circuit 24. In particular, the current sensing device 32 is<br>
located between the lower switching devices Sa1, Sb1, Sc1, Sd1 of the switching circuit<br>
24 and the negative terminal 30 of the power supply 22. The current sensing device<br>
32 may be a sensor that measures the voltage drop across a resistor. The current<br>
sensing device 32 may be capable of converting the measured voltage drop to a<br>
current (represented by i dc link) through the DC link according to well-known<br>
methods. The current sensor 32 can be on the negative rail (as shown) or on the<br>
positive rail. Alternatively, the measured voltage drop from sensor 32 may be<br>
provided to the controller 34 and the controller 34 may convert the sensed voltage<br>
drop to a current.<br><br>
Each switching device within a high and low set of switching devices is<br>
complementary to the other switching device. For example, voltage Va at one end of<br>
winding W1 may either be ON, by directing switch Sah to conduct while directing Sal<br>
to stop conducting, or OFF by directing switch Sah to stop conducting while directing<br>
Sal to start conducting. Voltage Vb, Vc and Vd are controlled in the same manner.<br>
However, all of the voltages Va, Vb, Vc and Vd can be operated independently of<br>
each other.<br>
For a two-phase motor system, this results in sixteen possible switching states.<br>
The table illustrated in FIG. 2 reflects the sixteen possible switching states as vectors.<br>
The first column in the table represents the states (open/closed) of the first set of<br>
switching devices Sah, Sal. The second column in the table represents the states<br>
(open/closed) of the second set of switching devices Sbh, Sb1. The third column in<br>
the table represents the states (open/closed) of the third set of switching devices Sch,<br>
Sc1. The fourth column in the table represents the states (open/closed) of the third set<br>
of switching devices Sdh, Sd1. The fifth and sixth columns reflect the sixteen vector<br>
states. The seventh column reflects the relationship between the current through the<br>
DC link (i_dc_link) and the currents i1 and i2 through the phase windings W1 and<br>
W2. Out of the sixteen possible switching states, there are twelve active vector states<br>
where current will flow through the DC link and four zero vector states (0000, 1100,<br>
0011, 1111) where little or no current will flow through the DC link and only a DC<br>
offset current will be registered. As can be seen there are many motor drive states<br>
where the individual current for Winding W1 or W2 can not be measured on the DC<br>
link, but only a combination of the two. For example, vector 1001 includes a<br>
combination of i1-i2.<br>
The present invention uses PWM signals to control the states of the switching<br>
devices. By controlling the states of the switching devices, desired phase voltages<br>
may be applied to the phase windings W1 and W2 of the motor.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a typical inverter voltage space vector diagram for PWM<br>
operation. The vector diagram is divided into four sectors I-IV. When the inverter or<br>
switching circuit is driving the motor, the voltage space vector Vαβ will rotate at the<br>
same speed as the motor. A voltage space vector will fall within one of the sectors or<br>
fall on one of the active vectors. If the voltage space vector falls within a sector, two<br><br>
adjacent vectors are chosen. For example, FIG. 3 illustrates a voltage space vector<br>
Vαβ falling within sector I. The voltage space vector Vαβ can be represented by two<br>
adjacent vectors V1' and V2' in the following relations:<br>
Vαβ = V1' + V2'	(1)<br>
V1' = V1*(t1/Tp)	(2)<br>
V2' = V2 * (t2/Tp)	(3)<br>
In the above relations, t1 is a first time period during which vector V1 is<br>
applied; t2 is a second time period during which vector V2 is applied; and Tp is a full<br>
pulse width modulated cycle or period (typically fifty microseconds). The amplitude<br>
of the voltage space vector Vαβ can be described by a modulation index.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a timing diagram is shown for naturally symmetric PWM<br>
signals. Each timing diagram shows the voltage pulse trains applied to the switching<br>
devices to produce voltages Va, Vb, Vc, Vd on the windings W1, W2 of the motor<br>
that correspond to the two phases of the motor over a single pulse width modulation<br>
cycle or period Tp. The pulse timing can be driven by a simple ramp signal 40 that<br>
operates on various thresholds 42. For example, a Vc threshold on a downward ramp<br>
signal will apply the voltage Vc, and the same Vc threshold on an upward ramp signal<br>
will remove the voltage Vc. Thresholds Va, Vb and Vd work similarly in this<br>
symmetric manner. In this example, winding W1 is idle across the period, i.e. Vab=0<br>
(Va-Vb=0), and winding W2 is being driven by a positive voltage Vcd over two<br>
quarters of the period Tp.<br>
In pulse width modulation schemes, the pulse width modulated signal is not<br>
constant. Rather, the signal is on for a part of the period and off for another part of<br>
the period. In FIG. 4, the high state of the voltage pulse train indicates that an upper<br>
switching device Sah, Sbh, Sch, Sdh is closed (and a corresponding lower switching<br>
device Sa1, Sb1, Sc1, Sd1 is open by a corresponding opposite voltage pulse train (not<br>
shown)). The low state of the voltage pulse train indicates that an upper switching<br>
device Sah, Sbh, Sch, Sdh is open (and a corresponding lower switching device Sa1,<br>
Sb1, Sc1, Sd1 is closed by a corresponding opposite voltage pulse train (not shown)).<br>
The patterns of the voltage pulse trains are symmetrical to a center axis that represents<br>
a half pulse width period tp.<br><br>
At the bottom of FIG. 4, the corresponding vectors (from FIG. 2) are shown.<br>
In this example, any of sample points S1-S4 can be taken to determine current i2 in<br>
winding W2 (at vector 0010 or vector 1110), but it is not possible to independently<br>
find the current i1 in winding W1 inasmuch as none of the vectors contain i1 solely.<br>
Indeed, during the vectors 0000 and 1111 there is no current is passing through DC<br>
link (zero vector states). However, in half the time period Tp the active vector V2 is<br>
applied. In other words, a current will pass through the DC link during the vectors<br>
00010 and 1110. If the time period of vector 0010 or 1110 is sufficiently long<br>
enough, a current through the corresponding winding may be measured or sampled<br>
(S1-S4). Typically, the time period necessary to obtain an accurate sample<br>
measurement is about two microseconds, preferably taken in the middle of the pulse<br>
width. Therefore, a sampling window of about four microseconds is desired<br>
FIG. 5 shows one solution to the problem of obtaining both i1 and i2<br>
measurements involving shifting of the pulse train. This can be accomplished by<br>
manipulating then switching thresholds for Va and Vb during the PWM cycle as<br>
shown. For example, threshold Va1 is used to apply voltage Va, and threshold Va2 is<br>
used to remove voltage Va. Similarly, threshold Vb1 is used to apply voltage Vb, and<br>
threshold Vb2 is used to remove voltage Vb. In this case, a sample S1 can be taken<br>
during vector 1000 (or sample S3 during vector 0111) to determine il and samples S2<br>
or S4 can be taken to determine i2 as before. However, it is very difficult to manage<br>
the four PWM outputs and changing thresholds in this solution.<br>
FIGs. 6 and 7 show a further solution to mitigate the problems inherent in the<br>
solution of FIG. 5, by using a phase grounding approach (FIG. 6) and then introducing<br>
small active states (FIG. 7) for measurement. Phase grounding is to choose vector<br>
0000 for zero-vector synthesis by turning-on the corresponding lower devices. The<br>
advantage of this is the reduction of switching and the switching losses inherent<br>
therein. In addition, any coupling interaction between windings is reduced and there<br>
is no need to use a gate drive with 100% duty cycle capability. As shown in FIG. 6<br>
(and referencing FIG. 4), the only non-zero active vector is Vc. Other vectors Va, Vb<br>
and Vd are zero vectors. As a result, Va, Vb and Vd are at virtual grounds (i.e. phase<br>
grounding), but the drive to the motor is essentially the same as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
However, it is still necessary to change switching thresholds during the PWM cycle.<br><br>
Therefore, it is desirable to merge the Vc ON states into one (arrows), wherein a<br>
single Vc threshold can be maintained for the ramp signal, and the amount of<br>
switching is minimized. As before, i2 can again be sampled at S1, but i1 still can not<br>
be sampled.<br>
After phase grounding, one or more vectors can be artificially introduced to<br>
measure i1 as shown in FIG. 7. In this case two vectors are introduced within the<br>
0010 vector (resulting after the merging of the Vc ON states) of FIG. 6. The two<br>
introduced vectors are of a minimal time period (e.g. four microseconds) that is<br>
sufficient to provide an accurate measurement. As shown for sample S2, Va is turned<br>
on (Vb off) to drive a current i1 through W1 so that a sample can be measured.<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 2, just turning Va ON would result in a 1010 vector,<br>
which does not isolate i1. However, it can be noticed that a 1011 vector will isolate i1<br>
for measurement. Therefore, Vd can be turned on for the sample S2. This can be<br>
done as long as the Vc ON time is spread out such that the total ON time for Vcd (Vc-<br>
Vd) remains the same. During sample S2 current +i 1 is introduced into winding W1.<br>
In order to balance this out, so that an intended average Vab=0 state is maintained<br>
through the cycle, an equivalent-i1 current is introduced (shown as sample S3). In<br>
this case, Va is switched OFF (by the change from a downward to upward ramp<br>
indication), Vb is switched ON (also by the change from a downward to upward ramp<br>
indication), while Vd is left ON, with the resulting 0111 vector providing a -i1 current<br>
in winding W1. As a result, i1=(S3+S2)/2. As long as Vcd is ON for the same<br>
amount as FIGs. 4 and 6, this representation is substantially equivalent. Samples S1 or<br>
S4 can be used as before to measure i2. However, in this example it should be noted<br>
that there is much sampling and switching to be done during a very short time, which<br>
can introduce coupling effects between windings and switching problems.<br>
Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the active states and sampling between<br>
the windings are removed from each other. This can be done by providing two PWM<br>
ramp signals that are separated by 180 degrees, as shown in FIG. 8. This embodiment<br>
has several advantages. First, only one W2 active vector is needed which reduces<br>
switching losses. Second, the active states are well separated which not only reduces<br>
potential winding coupling, but also leaves room for the active vectors to widen (as<br>
motor drive requires) without interacting, i.e. increase dynamic range. In addition, the<br><br>
sampling points can remain fixed. As a result, this embodiment provides accurate<br>
two-phase motor measurements with a single current sensor for all the light and<br>
medium duty-cycle requirements for a two-phase motor. Although the special case of<br>
an average Vab=0 is shown (W1 is substantially idle), it should be recognized that if<br>
W1 is being driven, which is the typical case, then i1 can still be easily measured<br>
away from i2 (as represented in FIG. 9 below) as long as the W1 and W2 states do not<br>
overlap. In heavy load requirements, the active states of the windings may extent to<br>
most or all of the duty cycle of the PWM cycle, i.e. the drive voltage to one or both<br>
windings may be forced ON for most or all of the PWM cycle causing the active states<br>
to overlap. In this case, the solution of FIG. 8 may not be able to provide the isolated<br>
current measurement of each winding.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the two-phase motor under heavy load with overlapping active<br>
states (both ramps shown together). In the example shown, W2 is being driven for a<br>
large majority of the duty cycle. As long as W2 is off for a sufficient amount of time<br>
for sample S2 (at least four microseconds), then i1 can be accurately measured during<br>
vector 1000, and i2 can be measured anytime during sample S4. However, if the<br>
period for sample S2 is less than sufficient (e.g. four microseconds), then an accurate<br>
measurement for i1 can not be made. However, even in this heavy load embodiment,<br>
the present invention provides a technique where i1 can still be determined.<br>
Specifically, the sum current of i1+i2, due to applied vector 1010, can be measured at<br>
either sample point S1 or S3. Since i2 can be determined at S4, i1 can then be<br>
calculated from i1=Sl-S4 or i1=(il+i2)-i2.<br>
It should be noted it is undesirable for both motor windings to be driven at<br>
100% duty cycle as motor saturation occurs and the PWM system can no longer<br>
provide proper control of the motor. Therefore, it is preferred that the motor control<br>
algorithm will limit voltage output to guarantee that both active voltage vectors cannot<br>
be at 100% duty cycle. Specifically, the system provides that at least one of the<br>
windings will be driven at less than 100%, and preferably 100%-the minimum<br>
sampling window (i.e. fifty microseconds - four microseconds = forty-six<br>
microseconds), which will be referred herein after as Wmax. The minimum sampling<br>
window will hereinafter be referred to as Wmin.<br><br>
Similarly, problems may occur when using PWM signals if the time periods<br>
for either (or both) of the sample periods for the active vectors are very small or<br>
nonexistent. When the sample periods for the active vectors are very small or<br>
nonexistent, the system is not able to measure the currents through at least two phases<br>
of the windings in the motor. FIG. 10 shows the very-light load case where one of the<br>
windings is powered for a very short time (e.g. less than four microseconds), wherein<br>
an accurate sample can not be obtained. In this case something similar to the<br>
embodiment for FIG. 7 can be used wherein one of the vectors (0010) is widened<br>
while an artificial vector (0001) is introduced, by driving Vd, to balance out the<br>
current inequity caused by widening the short vector.<br>
For the example shown in FIG. 10, if it is assumed that the Vc ON time for<br>
active state vector 0010 is only three microseconds, then it is known that an accurate<br>
sample for S3 can not be obtained. One solution would be to spread the Vc ON time<br>
for another one microsecond (arrow) and apply a balancing one microsecond Vd On<br>
time (shown as sample S4. However, it is very difficult to control a one microsecond<br>
pulse in the PWM system. It is preferred that Vd ON time is also at least four<br>
microseconds for better control. This then requires that the sample S3 be spread not<br>
an addition one microsecond, but an additional four microseconds (seven<br>
microseconds total). Not only does this provide more stable operation, the presence<br>
of the new 0010 and 0001 vectors allows at least two samples (S2, S4) to be taken and<br>
averaged for a more consistent measurement result for current i2.<br>
As can be realized, there are many possible scenarios for driving a two-phase<br>
motor relating to the active vectors for W1 and W2. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention takes into account these different cases. As explained in more detail below,<br>
depending on the specific case, the PWM signals are applied in certain ways to allow<br>
a sufficient sampling window (or time period) for measuring a current across the<br>
sensor on the DC link. In order to ensure sufficient sampling window for valid DC-<br>
link current measurement, each case is identified and then appropriate shifts or<br>
modifications to the PWM signals are made by the controller of the system based on<br>
the identified case.<br><br>
In all of the above embodiments, the 0000 vector or zero voltage vector can be<br>
measured for zero-amp calibration and to take into account resistor and amplifier<br>
temperature coefficient drift.<br>
Generally, and referring to FIG. 11, the present invention describes a method<br>
for measuring the current in each phase of a two-phase motor by a single sensor, the<br>
motor being controlled by a plurality of switching devices that receive pulse width<br>
modulation signals from a controller. A first step 80 includes providing two ramp<br>
signals for a pulse width modulation controller for controlling the switches. The ramp<br>
signals being approximately one half cycle out of phase, with the first ramp signal for<br>
controlling the first set of switches and the second ramp signal for controlling the<br>
second set of switches. The dual ramp signals ensure that the distribution of pulses<br>
used to control one winding are approximately one-half of a PWM cycle away from<br>
the pulse distribution for the other winding.<br>
A next step 90 includes gating the first and second set of switches using the<br>
respective ramp signals. This results in a first voltage pulse train Vab, and second<br>
voltage pulse train Vcd associated with the two windings W1, W2 of the motor,<br>
respectively. The Vab and Vcd pulse trains provide a relative timing offset of<br>
approximately one-half cycle between the pulse width modulation signals driving the<br>
first and second windings of the motor.<br>
A next step includes the reading 100 a modulation index (i.e. duty cycle) for<br>
the pulse width modulation signals for one pulse width modulation cycle from a motor<br>
drive control. In other words, this step reads a first duty cycle of a first drive signal<br>
for the first winding and a second duty cycle of a second drive signal for the second<br>
winding. The method then uses the modulation index to determine how to when and<br>
how to modify the voltage pulse trains. First and second sampling windows are time<br>
periods defined within pulse train of the cycle that may allow certain current<br>
measurements to be taken. Preferably, measurement samples are taken in the middle<br>
of a sampling window. For adequate current measurement, these windows should be<br>
greater than a minimum window, Wmin. For control purposes, at least one of these<br>
windows should be less than 100%-Wmin, or Wmax. A next step includes<br>
configuring 104, 110, 114, 116, 118 the timing of the pulse width modulation signals<br>
to provide at least one timing window wherein at least of one of the windings of the<br><br>
motor is being driven while the other winding is not being driven, such that a single<br>
current sensor can sample the current of the at least one of the windings during the at<br>
least one timing window.<br>
In a first embodiment 104, when both the first and second sampling windows<br>
are less than the minimum sampling window (resulting in no overlapping) 102,<br>
artificial voltage vectors are introduced to add to the sampling period for both Vab<br>
and Vcd to provide sufficient sampling time. For example, for Vab, artificial and<br>
adjacent vectors 1000 and 0100 vectors are introduced to provide at least one sample<br>
for i 1 (as was demonstrated for Vab in FIG. 8). This is also the case where Vab is<br>
non-existent (Vab has zero duty cycle), with artificial vector 1000 being added to the<br>
existing 1000 vector and vector 0100 being placed adjacent (similar to what was<br>
demonstrated for Vcd in FIG. 10). For Vcd, artificial and adjacent vectors 0010 and<br>
0001 vectors are introduced to add to the sampling period to provide at least one<br>
sample for i2 (similar to what was demonstrated for Vab in FIG. 8). This is also the<br>
case where Vcd is non-existent (Vcd has zero duty cycle), with artificial vector 0010<br>
being added to the existing 0010 vector and vector 0001 being placed adjacent (as was<br>
demonstrated for Vcd in FIG. 10).<br>
In a second embodiment 110, when both sampling windows are greater than<br>
Wmin 106, and both sampling windows are less than Wmax 108, no artificial vectors<br>
need be introduced since i1 and i2 are isolated and can be sampled individually. For<br>
example, for Vab, i1 can be sampled during vector 1000 (as was demonstrated for<br>
Vab in FIG. 10), and for Vcd, i2 can be sampled during vectors 0010 (as was<br>
demonstrated for Vcd in FIG. 8).<br>
In a third embodiment 114, when both sampling windows are greater than<br>
Wmin 106, and the first sampling window is greater than Wmax, and the second<br>
sampling window is less than Wmax 108, the current of the first sample can not be<br>
obtained, but the current of the second sample can be obtained by itself. In this case,<br>
the first sample will contain the sum of the winding currents, and the second current is<br>
subtracted from this sum to obtain the first current (as was demonstrated in FIG. 9).<br>
In a fourth embodiment 116, when the first sampling window is less than<br>
Wmin, and the second sampling window is greater than Wmin 106, and both sampling<br>
windows are less than 100%-3 Wmin (hereinafter Wmax3) 112, than artificial vectors<br><br>
are introduced for the first sampling window (e.g. Vcd) to provide sufficient sampling<br>
time. For example, for Vcd, artificial, extended (3x), and adjacent vectors 0010 and<br>
0001 vectors can be introduced to add to the sampling period to provide at least one<br>
sample for i2 (as was demonstrated for FIG. 10). For Vab, artificial, extended (3x),<br>
and adjacent vectors 1000 and 0100 vectors can be introduced to add to the sampling<br>
period to provide at least one sample for i1 (as was demonstrated for Vcd in FIG. 10).<br>
In a fifth embodiment 118, when the first sampling window is less than Wmin,<br>
and the second sampling window is greater than Wmin 106, and at least one of the<br>
sampling windows is greater than 100%-3*Wmin 112, then artificial vectors are<br>
introduced for the first sampling window (e.g. Vcd) to provide sufficient sampling<br>
time. For example, for Vab less than Wmin, artificial and adjacent vectors 1011 and<br>
0111 vectors are introduced to add to the sampling period to provide at least one<br>
sample for i1 (as was demonstrated for FIG. 7 wherein the W2-11 vector is introduced<br>
along with the two active W1 vectors). This is subtracted from the second sample,<br>
which contains the sum of the currents, to obtain the sample for i2. As shown in FIG<br>
12, i1 = ((Sl-i2) - (S2-i2))/2 so i1 = (Sl-S2)/2. Alternatively, another option is to<br>
create a sub-case where the W2 null vector (11) is aligned with only one of the two<br>
introduced W1 vectors .<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention also provides technique for<br>
abnormal operation for the motor. For example, if one of the windings is shorted (or<br>
the associated switches shorted) and turned OFF, breaking torque for the motor will<br>
come from free-wheeling, recirculating current only. However, it will still be possible<br>
to use the common shunt current sensor to read the current from the other good<br>
winding. In addition, is desirable that the controller incorporate delay compensation<br>
between the controller and the power stage. This will provide compensation for the<br>
propagation delay between these stages.<br>
After one of the above embodiments is performed, depending on the<br>
determined duty cycle, a next step 90 includes gating the first and second set of<br>
switches using the respective ramp signals in accordance with the modifications of<br>
selected embodiment above. A final step 95 includes sampling the current in at least<br>
one of the windings in the defined sampling windows to determine the current in both<br>
windings, as detail previously.<br><br>
What has been described is an improved procedure for measuring current<br>
flowing in a two-phase device with a single current sensor external to the motor. The<br>
above-described procedure modifies existing PWM operation based on specific cases.<br>
The procedure involves monitoring currents in a motor phase over very short periods.<br>
It should be recognized that switching devices other than FETs can be used.<br>
However, in that case, external diodes are added to replicate FET body diodes so that<br>
the operation of the present inventions is the same as that with FETs.<br>
The above description of the present invention is intended to be exemplary<br>
only and is not intended to limit the scope of any patent issuing from this application.<br>
