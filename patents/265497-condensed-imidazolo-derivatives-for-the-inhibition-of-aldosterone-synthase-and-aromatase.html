As used herein, the term "isomers" refers to different compounds that have the same molecular formula. Also as used herein, the term "an optical isomer" refers to any of the various stereo isomeric configurations which may exist for a given compound of the present invention and includes geometric isomers. It is understood that a substituent "nay be attached at a chiral center of a carbon atom. Therefore, the invention includes enantiomers, diastereomers or racemates of the compound. "Enantiomers" are a pair of stereoisomers that are non- superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a "racemic" mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. "Diastereoisomers" are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn- Ingold- Prelog R-S system. When a compound is ?. pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+} or (-) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Additionally, resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated by high pressure liquid chromatognaphy (HPLC) retention time (tr) using a chiral adsorbent. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention is meant to include all such possible<br>
isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synfhons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis- or trans-configuration. All tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>

As used herein, the term "treating" or "treatment" of any disease or disorder refers in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment "treating" or "treatment" refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the patient. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to preventing or delaying the onset or development or progression of the disease or disorder.<br>
As used herein, the term "abnormal" refers to an activity or feature which differs from a normal activity or feature.<br>
As used herein, the term "abnormal activity" refers to an activity which differs from the activity of the wild- type or native gene or protein, or which differs from the activity of the gene or protein in a healthy subject.

As used herein, the term "a," "an," "the" and similar terms used in the context of the present invention (especially in the context of the claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and plural unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by the context. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range. Unless<br>
otherwise indicated herein, each individual value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g. "such as") provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention.<br>
Any asymmetric carbon atom on the compounds of the present invention can be present in the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)- configuration, preferably in the (R)- or (S)- configuration. Substituents at atoms with unsaturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis- (Z)- or trans (£)- form. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention can be in the form of one of the possible isomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, diastereomers, optical isomers (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular, the imidazolyl moiety may thus be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl tartaric acid, di-0,0'-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.<br>
Finally, compounds of the present invention are either obtained in the free form, as a salt thereof, or as prodrug derivatives thereof.<br>
When a basic group is present in the compounds of the present invention, the compounds can be converted into acid addition salts thereof, in particular, acid addition salts with the imidazolyl moiety of the structure, preferably pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. These are formed, with inorganic acids or organic acids. Suitable inorganic acids include but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid. Suitable organic acids include but are not limited to, carboxylic acids, such as (Cr C4)alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, e.g., acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, e.g., oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, e.g., glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, e.g., aspartic or glutamic acid, organic sulfonic acids, such as (CrC4)alkylsulfonic acids, e.g., methanesulfonic acid; or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, e.g., by halogen. Preferred are salts formed with hydrochloric acid, methanesulfonic acid and maleic acid.<br>
When an acidic group is present in the compounds of the present invention, the compounds can be converted into salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. Such salts include alkali metal salts, like sodium, lithium and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, like calcium and magnesium salts; ammonium salts with organic bases, e.g., trimethylamine salts, diethylamine salts, fr/s(hydroxymethyl)methylamine salts, dicyclohexylamine salts and W-methyl-D-glucamine salts; salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine and the like. Salts may be formed using conventional methods, advantageously in the presence of an ethereal or alcoholic solvent, such as a lower alkanol. From the solutions of the latter, the salts may be precipitated with ethers, e.g., diethyl ether. Resulting salts may be converted into the free compounds by treatment with acids. These or other salts can also be used for purification of the compounds obtained.<br>
When both a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule, the compounds of the present invention can also form internal salts.<br>
The present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro-drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be<br>
-conceptually divided into two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001). Generally, bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound, that contains one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity. Typically, the formation of active drug compound involves a metabolic process or reaction that is one of the follow types:<br>
1.	Oxidative reactions, such as oxidation of alcohol, carbonyl, and acid<br>
functions, hydroxyation of aliphatic carbons, hydroxyation of aiicyclic carbon atoms,<br>
oxidation of aromatic carbon atoms, oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds, oxidation of<br>
nitrogen-containing functional groups, oxidation of silicon, phosphorus, arsenic, and sulfur,<br>
oxidative N-delakyiation, oxidative O- and S-delakylation, oxidative deamination, as well as<br>
other oxidative reactions.<br>
2.	Reductive reactions, such as reduction of carbonyl groups, reduction of<br>
alcoholic groups and carbon-carbon double bonds, reduction of nitrogen-containing<br>
functions groups, and other reduction reactions.<br>
3.	Reactions without change in the state of oxidation, such as hydrolysis of<br>
esters and ethers, hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-nitrogen single bonds, hydrolytic cleavage<br>
of non-aromatic heterocycles, hydration and dehydration at multiple bonds, new atomic<br>
linkages resulting from dehydration reactions, hydrolytic dehalogenation, removal of<br>
hydrogen halide molecule, and other such reactions.<br>
Carrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety, e.g., that improve uptake and/or localized delivery to a site(s) of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug, the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond, the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound, and any released transport moiety is acceptably non-toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake, typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases, it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release, e.g., certain polymers or other moieties, such as cyclodextrins. See, Cheng et at., US20040077595, application Ser. No. 10/656,838, incorporated herein by reference. Such carrier prodrugs are often<br>
advantageous for orally administered drugs. Carrier prodrugs can, for example, be used to improve one or more of the following properties: increased lipophilicity, increased duration of pharmacological effects, increased site-specificity, decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, and/or improvement in drug formulation (e.g., stability, water solubility, suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property). For example, lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of hydroxy groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids, or of carboxylic acid groups with alcohols, e.g., aliphatic alcohols. Wermuth, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32, Ed. Werriuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001.<br>
Exemplary prodrugs are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and S-acyl and O-acyl derivatives of thiols, alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Preferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the o-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the a-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition, amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde (Bundgaard, J. Med. Chem. 2503 (1989)). Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups (Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985)). Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. EP 039,051 (Sloan and Little) discloses Mannich-base hydroxamic acid prodrugs, their preparation and use.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the compounds, the compounds in the form of their salts and the pro-drugs, any reference to the compounds of the present invention is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention, as appropriate and expedient.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have valuable pharmacological properties. The compounds of the present invention are useful as aldosterone synthase inhibitors. Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a mitcohcondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing the last step of aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex, i.e., the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone. Aldosterone synthase has been demonstrated to be expressed in all cardiovascular tissues such as heart, umbilical cord, mesenteric and pulmonary arteries, aorta, endothelium and vascular cells. Moreover, the expression of aldosterone synthase is closely correlated with aldosterone production in cells. It has been observed that elevations of aldosterone activities or aldosterone levels induce different diseases such as congestive heart failure, cardiac or myocardial fibrosis, renal failure, hypertension, ventricular arrhythmia and other adverse effects, etc., and that the inhibition of aldosterone or aldosterone synthase would be useful therapeutic approaches. See e.g., Ulmschenider et al.

Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention as aldosterone synthase inhibitors, are also useful for treatment of a disorder or disease mediated by aldosterone synthase or<br>
responsive to inhibition of aldosterone synthase. In particular, the compounds of the present invention as aldosterone synthase inhibitors are useful for treatment of a disorder or disease characterized by abnormal aldosterone synthase activity. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are also useful for treatment of a disorder or disease selected from hypokalemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, in particular, chronic renal failure, restenosis, atherosclerosis, syndrome X, obesity, nephropathy, post-myocardial infarction, coronary heart diseases, inflammation, increased formation of collagen, fibrosis such as cardiac or myocardiac fibrosis and remodeling following hypertension and endothelial dysfunction.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present inventions are useful as aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase is a cytochrome P450 enzyme, it plays a central role in the extragonadal biosynthesis of estrogens such as estradiol, estrone and estrol, and is widely distributed in muscular and adipose tissue (Longcope C, Pratt J H, Schneider S H, Fineberg S E, 1977, J. din. Endocrinol. Metab. 45:1134-1145). An increase in aromatase activity has been confirmed to be associated with estrogen-dependent disorders or diseases. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are also useful for treatment of a disorder or disease characterized by abnormal expression of aromatase. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treatment of an estrogen-dependent disorder or disease. More preferably, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treatment of an estrogen-dependent disorder or disease selected from gynecomastia, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, polycystic ovarian disease, infertility, fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer and fibrocystic mastopathy.<br>

Scheme?<br>
(Scheme Removed)The N-protected imidazole intermediates (XXI) and (XXII) are prepared according to Scheme 8. Esterification of acid (XXIII) with an alcohol, preferably methano! or ethanol,. under acidic conditions followed by protection of the imidazole nitrogen, preferably as the N-trityl analog gives (XXII), with RB and R7 equal to hydrogen. Reduction of (XXII) to the alcohol by a suitable reducing agent, preferably NaBH4, followed by protection as the TBS ether gives (XXI). Esters (XXII) where Re and R7 are not both hydrogen are generated by alkylation of esters (XXII) with a suitable electrophile, e.g. a benzyl bromide, under basic conditions. Conversion of the ester (XXII) to ether (XXI) with Ra and R? not both hydrogen may be effected by reduction and protection of the resultant alcohol by analogy to above.

Esters (XXII) where R7 equals H may be generated by Wittig olefination of ketones (XXIV) by analogy to methods outlined in S/oorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12(9), 2273. Subsequent reduction of the olefinic moiety with a suitable reducing agent, such as hydrogen, utilizing a palladium catalyst yields ester (XXII).   Esters (XXV) are produced by alkylations of esters (XXV) where Re and/or R7 are hydrogen under basic conditions in the presence of a suitable electrophile, e.g. methyl iodide. Homologation of ester (XXV) to ether (XXI) can be achieved by reduction with a suitable reagent, such as LAN, followed by oxidation to the aldehyde, treatment of the aldehyde with the ylide generated from methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium chloride to produce the homolog<br>

Reduction of the resultant oiefins yields the saturated ether (XXI) with R6 equal to hydrogen, which may be N-alkylated with a bromide (VII) by analogy to step 4 outlined in Scheme 1 for the conversion of (VI) to (VIII).<br>

In starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino thiol, carboxyl<br>
and hydroxyl groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.<br>
Well-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, e.g., in McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, NY (1973); and Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY (1999).<br>
The above-mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably, such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents, respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperatures, preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used, and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure. The preferred solvents, catalysts and reaction conditions are set forth in the appended illustrative Examples.<br>
The invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which the starting materials are formed in situ under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure antipodes.<br>
Compounds of the invention and intermediates can also be converted into each other according to methods generally known perse.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for particular routes of administration such as oral administration, parenteral administration, and rectal administration, etc. In<br>
addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be made up in a solid form including capsules, tablets, pills, granules, powders or suppositories, or in a liquid form including solutions, suspensions or emulsions. The pharmaceutical compositions can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or can contain conventional inert diluents, lubricating agents, or buffering agents, as well as adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifers and buffers etc.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are tablets and gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient together with<br>
a)	diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or<br>
glycine;<br>
b)	lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or<br>
polyethyleneglycol; for tablets also<br>

methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone; if<br>
desired<br>
d)	disintegrants, e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent<br>
mixtures; and/or<br>
e)	absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners.<br>
Tablets may be either film coated or enteric coated according to methods known in the art.<br>
Suitable compositions for oral administration include an effective amount of a compound of the invention in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use are prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with nontoxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients are, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets are uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Injectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. Said compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Said compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1-75%, preferably about 1-50%, of the active ingredient.<br>
Suitable compositions for transdermal application include an effective amount of a compound of the invention with carrier. Advantageous carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound of the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.<br>
Suitable compositions for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, include aqueous solutions, suspensions, ointments, creams, gels or sprayable formulations, e.g., for delivery by aerosol or the like. Such topical delivery systems will in particular be appropriate for dermal application, e.g., for the treatment of skin cancer, e.g., for prophylactic use in sun creams, lotions, sprays and the like. They are thus particularly suited for use in topical,<br>
including cosmetic, formulations well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.<br>
The present invention further provides anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising the compounds of the present invention as active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations overtime. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles &amp; Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.<br>
Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected.<br>
An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e. g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.<br>
The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more agents that reduce the rate by which the compound of the present invention as an active ingredient will decompose. Such agents, which are referred to herein as "stabilizers," include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers, etc.<br>
he pharmaceutical compositions contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention as defined above, either alone or in a combination with one or more therapeutic agents, e.g., each at an effective therapeutic dose as reported in the art. Such theraprutic agents include at least one or two or more selected from the following groups:<br>

(xi)	an obesity-reducing agent;<br>
(xii)	an aldosterone receptor blocker;<br>
(xiii)	an endothelin receptor blocker;<br>
(xiv)	a CETP inhibitor;<br>
(xv)	an inhibitor of Na-K-ATPase membrane pump;<br>
(xvi)    a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker or an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker; (xvii)    a neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor; and (xviii)   an inotropic agent.<br>
An angiotensin II receptor antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is understood to be an active ingredients which bind to the AT-] -receptor subtype of angiotensin II receptor but do not result in activation of the receptor. As a consequence of the inhibition of the ATi receptor, these antagonists can, for example, be employed as antihypertensives or for treating congestive heart failure.<br>
The class of AT., receptor antagonists comprises compounds having differing structural features, essentially preferred are the non-peptidic ones. For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting of valsartan, iosartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, saprisartan, tasosartan, telmisartan, the compound with the designation E-1477 of the following formula<br>

The natriuretic peptides constitute a family of peptides that include the atrial (ANP), brain-derived (BNP) and C-type natriuretic (CNP) peptides. The natriuretic peptides effect vasodilation, natriuresis, diuresis, decreased aldosterone release, decreased cell growth,<br>
and inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system indicating their involvement in the regulation of blood pressure and of sodium and water balance. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) inhibitors impede degradation of natriuretic peptides and elicit pharmacological actions potentially beneficial in the management of several cardiovascular disorders. A NEP inhibitor useful in the said combination is an agent selected from the group represented by candoxatril, sinorphan, SCH 34826 and SCH 42495.<br>
An inotropic agent is selected from the group consisting of: digoxin, digitoxin, digitalis, dobutamine, dopamine, epinephrine, milrinone, amrinone and ncrepinephrine, etc.<br>
A compound of the present invention may be administered either simultaneously, before or after the other active ingredient, either separately by the same or different route of administration or together in the same pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Furthermore, the combinations as described above can be administered to a subject via simultaneous, separate or sequential administration (use). Simultaneous administration (use) can take place in the form of one fixed combination with two or three or more active ingredients , or by simultaneously administering two or three or more compounds that are formulated independently. Sequential administration(use) preferably means administration of one (or more) compounds or active ingredients of a combination at one time point, other compounds or active ingredients at a different time point, that is, in a chronically staggered manner, preferably such that the combination shows more efficiency than the single compounds administered independently (especially showing synergism). Separate administration (use) preferably means administration of the compounds or active ingredients of the combination independently of each other at different time points, preferably meaning that two, or three or more compounds are administered such that no overlap of measurable blood levels of both compounds are present in an overlapping manner (at the same time).<br>
Also combinations of two or three or more of sequential, separate and simultaneous administrations are possible, preferably such that the combination compound-drugs show a joint therapeutic effect that exceeds the effect found when the combination compound-drugs are used independently at time intervals so large that no mutual effect on their therapeutic efficiency can be found, a synergistic effect being especially preferred.<br>

The activities of a compound according to the present invention can be assessed by the following in vitro &amp; in vivo methods well-described in the art. See Fieber, A et al. (2005), "Aldosterone Synthase Inhibitor Ameliorates Angiotensin ll-lnduced Organ<br>
Damage," Circulation, 111:3087-3094; see also Stresser DM, Turner SD, McNarnara J, et al (2000), "A high-throughput screen to identify inhibitors of aromatase (CYP19)," Anal Biochenr, 284:427-30. All the references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
In particular, the aldosterone synthase and aromatase inhibitory activities in vitro can be determined by the following assays.<br>
Human adrenocortical carcinoma NCI-H295R cell line is obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS)-A supplement (100x), DMEM/F-12, antibiotic/antimycotic (100x), and fetal calf serum (PCS) are purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY). Anti-mouse PVT scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads and NBS 96-well plates are obtained from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) and Corning (Acton, MA), respectively. Solid black 96-well flat bottom plates are purchased from Costar (Corning, NY). Aldosterone and angiotensin (Ang II) are purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). D-[1,2,6,7-3H(N)]aldosterone was acquired from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). Nu-serum was a product of BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The NADPH regenerating system, dibenzylfluorescein (DBF), and human aromatase supersomes® are obtained from Gentest (Woburn, MA).<br>
For in vitro measurement of aldosterone activity, human adrenocortical carcinoma NCI-H295R cells are seeded in NBS 96-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well in 100 ul of a growth medium containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FCi?, 2.5% Nu-serum, 1 ug ITS/ml, and 1x antibiotic/antimycotic. The medium is changed after culturing for 3 days at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. On the following day, cells are rinsed with 100 ul of DMEM/F12 and incubated with 100 ul of treatment medium containing 1 uM Ang II and a compound at different concentrations in quadruplicate wells at 37 °C for 24 hr. At the end of incubation, 50 ul of medium is withdrawn from each well for measurement of aldosterone production by an RIA using mouse anti-aldosterone monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Measurement of aldosterone activity can also be performed using a 96-well plate format. Each test sample is incubated with 0.02 uCi of D-[1,2,6,7-3H(N)]aldosterone and 0.3 ug of anti-aldosterone antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 12% glycerol in a total volume of 200 pi at room temperature for 1 hr. Anti-mouse PVT SPA beads (50 ul) are then added to each well and<br>
incubated overnight at room temperature prior to counting in a Microbeta plate counter. The amount of aldosterone in each sample is calculated by comparing with a standard curve generated using known quantities of the hormone.<br>
To measure aromatase activity, the human aromatase assay is performed in 96-well flat bottom plates according to a published protocol (Stresser et al, 2000) with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 pi of an NADPH regenerating system containing 2.6 mM NADP+, 6.6 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 6.6 mM MgCI2, and 0.8 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, is pre-incubated with the test compound at a desired concentration at 30 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 100 ul. Afterwards, 4 pmol of human aromatase, 20 ug of control microsoma! protein, and 4 uM DBF in 100 ul of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, is added to each well and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 75 u! of 2 N NaOH to each well. After 2 hr, the product, fluorescein, is measured by a fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 538 nm, respectively.<br>
Full concentration-response curves of the test compound are performed at least 3 times. The IC60 values are derived using a non-linear least squares curve-fitting program from Microsoft XLfit.<br>
The in vivo inhibitory activities for aldosterone synthase and aromatase can be determined by the following assays.<br>
Test compounds (i.e., potential aldosterone synthase inhibitors) are profiled in vivo in a conscious rat model of acute secondary hyperaldosteronism. Wild-type rats are instrumented with chronically indwelling arterial and venous cannulas, which are exteriorized through a tether/swivel system. The ambulatory rats are housed in specialized cages to allow blood sampling and parenteral drug administration without disturbing the animals. Angiotensin II is continuously infused intravenously at a level sufficient to elevate plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) by -200-fold to 1-5 nM. This PAC increase is sustained at a stable level for at least 8-9 hours. Test compounds are administered p.o. (via oral gavage) or parenterally (via the arterial catheter) after one hour of angiotensin II infusion at a time when PAC has increased to a steady-state level. Arterial blood samples are collected before and at various times (up to 24 hours) after test agent administration for later determination of PAC and concentration of test agent. From these measurements, various<br>
parameters can be derived, e.g., 1) onset and duration of PAC reduction by the test agent, 2) pharmacokinetic parameters of the test agent such as half-life, clearance, volume of distribution, and oral biovailability, 3) dose/PAC response, dose/test-agent concentration, and test-agent concentration/PAC response relationships, and 4) dose- and concentration-potencies and efficacy of the test agent. A successful test compound decreases PAC in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in the dose range of about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg i.a. or P.O.<br>
