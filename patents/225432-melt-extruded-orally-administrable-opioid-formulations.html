				<td>MELT-EXTRUDED ORALLY ADMINISTRABLE OPIOID FORMULATTONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of melt extrusion technology in the<br>
production of bioavailable sustained-release matrix pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Previously, melt extrusion has been used in the production of immediate release<br>
formulations.<br>
It is known in the pharmaceutical art to prepare compositions which provide<br>
for controlled release of pharmacologically active substances contained in the<br>
compositions after oral administration to humans and animals. Such slow release<br>
compositions are used to delay absorption of a medicament until it has reached certain<br>
portions of the alimentary tract. Such sustained-release of a medicament in the<br>
alimentary tract further maintains a desired concentration of said medicament in the<br>
blood stream for a longer duration than would occur if conventional rapid release<br>
dosage forms are administered.<br>
Different methods of preparing controlled release pharmaceutical dosage forms<br>
have been suggested. For example, direct compression techniques, wet granulation<br>
techniques, encapsulation techniques and the like have been proposed to deliver<br>
pharmaceutically active ingredients to the alimentary tract over extended periods.<br>
Additionally, various types of sustained release formulations are known in the<br>
art, including specially coated pellets, coated tablets and capsules wherein the slow ire-<br>
lease of the active medicament is brought about through selective breakdown of the<br>
coating of the preparation or through compounding with a special matrix to affect the<br>
release of a drug. Some sustained release formulations provide for related sequential<br>
release of a single dose of an active compound at predetermined periods after administration.<br>
It is the intent of all sustained-release preparations to provide a longer period<br>
of pharmacologic response after the administration of the drug and is ordinarily<br>
experienced after the administration of the rapid release dosage forms. Such longer<br>
periods of response provide for many inherent therapeutic benefits that are not<br>
achieved with corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. This is<br>
especially true in the treatment of cancer patients or other patients in need of treatment<br>
for the alleviation of moderate to severe pain, where blood levels of an opioid<br>
analgesic medicament must be maintained at a therapeutically effective level to provide<br>
pain relief. Unless conventional rapid acting drug therapy is carefully administered at<br>
frequent intervals to maintain effective steady state blood levels of the drug, peaks and<br>
valleys in the blood level of the active drug occur because of the rapid absorption,<br>
systemic excretion of the compound and through metabolic inactivation, thereby<br>
producing special problems in maintenance of analgesic efficacy.<br>
The prior art teaching of the preparation and use of compositions providing the<br>
sustained-release of an active compound from a carrier is basically concerned with the<br>
release of the active substance into the physiologic fluid of the alimentary tract. How-<br>
ever, it is generally recognized that the mere presence of an active substance in the<br>
gastrointestinal fluids does not, by itself, insure bioavailability.<br>
In order to be absorbed, the active drug substance must be in solution. The<br>
time required for a given proportion of an active substance from a unit dosage form is<br>
determined as the proportion of the amount of active drug substance released from a<br>
unit dosage form over a specified time base by a test method conducted under<br>
standardized conditions. The physiologic fluids of the gastrointestinal tract are the<br>
media for determining dissolution time. The present state of the art recognizes many<br>
satisfactory test procedures to measure dissolution time for pharmaceutical compo-<br>
sitions, and these test procedures are described in official compendia world wide.<br>
Although there are many diverse factors which influence the dissolution of drug<br>
substance from its carrier, the dissolution time determined for a pharmacologically<br>
active substance from the specific composition is relatively constant and reproducible.<br>
Among the different factors affecting the dissolution time are the surface area of the<br>
drug substance presented to the dissolution solvent medium, the pH of the solution,<br>
the solubility of the substance in the specific solvent medium, and the driving forces of<br>
the saturation concentration of dissolved materials in the solvent medium. Thus, the<br>
dissolution concentration of an active drug substance is dynamically modified in its<br>
steady state as components are removed from the dissolution medium through<br>
absorption across the tissue site. Under physiologic conditions, the saturation level of<br>
the dissolved materials is replenished from the dosage form reserve to maintain a<br>
relatively uniform and constant dissolution concentration in the solvent medium<br>
providing for a steady state absorption.<br>
The transport across a tissue absorption site of the gastrointestinal tract is<br>
influenced by the Donnan osmotic equilibrium forces on both sides of the membrane<br>
since the direction of the driving force is the difference between the concentrations of<br>
active substance on either side of the membrane, i.e., the amount dissolved in the<br>
gastrointestinal fluids and the amount present in the blood. Since the blood levels are<br>
constantly being modified by dilution, circulatory changes, tissue storage, metabolic<br>
conversion and systemic excretion, the flow of active materials is directed from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream.<br>
Notwithstanding the diverse factors influencing both dissolution and absorption<br>
of a drug substance, a strong correlation has been established between the in-vitro<br>
dissolution time determined for a dosage form and (in-vivo) bioavailability. The<br>
dissolution time and the bioavailability determined for a composition are two of the<br>
most significant fundamental characteristics for consideration when evaluating<br>
sustained-release compositions.<br>
Melt granulation techniques have also been suggested to provide controlled<br>
release formulations. Generally, melt granulation involves mechanically working an<br>
active ingredient in paniculate form with one or more suitable binders and/or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a mixer until one or more of the binders<br>
melts and adheres to the surface of the particulate, eventually building up granules.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,957,681 (Klimesch, et. al.) discloses a continuous process<br>
for preparing pharmaceutical mixtures having at least two components which are<br>
continuously metered. The process includes continuously metering the individual<br>
components of the pharmaceutical mixture at a rate of at least 50 g/h on electronic<br>
differential metering balances having a metering accuracy of at least ± 5% within time<br>
intervals of less than one minute and, additionally, having screw conveyors, thereby<br>
obtaining a substantially uniformly metered mixture; and shaping the mixture. Example<br>
1 of the '681 patent is representative of the process. The requisite amounts of a<br>
copolymer having a K value of 30 and obtained from 60% of N-vinylpyrrolid-2-one<br>
(NVP), stearyl alcohol and theophylline are metered via three metering balances into<br>
the hopper of an extruder and extruded. The temperatures of the extruder cylinder<br>
consisting of six shots ranged from 30-60°C and the die is heated to 100°C. The<br>
resultant extrudate is then pressed into tablets of the required shape. The '681 patent<br>
does not disclose preparation of sustained release opioid pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
N. Follonier., et al., Hot-Melt Extruded Pellets for the Sustained Release of<br>
Highly Dosed Freely Soluble Drugs. Proceed. Intern. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact.<br>
Mater., 18 (1991) describes certain diltiazem hydrochloride formulations prepared<br>
using hot-melt screw-extrusion to obtain sustained-release pellets to be filled into hard<br>
gelatin capsules. The polymers used were ethylcellulose, a copolymer of ehtyl acrylate<br>
and methyl methacrylate containing quaternary ammonium groups, cellulose acetate<br>
butyrate, poly(vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate) and a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl<br>
acetate. In order to lower the extrusion temperature, some plasticizers were used.<br>
WO 93/07859 describes drug loaded pellets produced through melt<br>
spheronization wherein the therapeutically active agent is blended with various<br>
excipoients and binders; the formulation is fed to an extruder where it is heated and<br>
extruded at a speed of about 0.05 to 10 mm/sec, at approximately 60-180° C. The<br>
extrudate is then cut into pieces in a pelletizer and subsequently fed to a spheronizer<br>
for uniform pellet formulation.<br>
Despite the foregoing advances and the various techniques for preparing<br>
sustained release formulations available in the pharmaceutical art, there is a need in the<br>
art for an orally administrate opioid formulation which would provide an extended<br>
duration of effect which is also easy to prepare, e.g via melt-granulation techniques.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide sustained- release<br>
pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration and methods for preparing<br>
the same utilizing melt-extrusion techniques.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide improved methods for<br>
producing pharmaceutical extrudates containing opioid analgesics and pharmaceutical<br>
acceptable hydrophobic materials via melt extrusion techniques.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide methods of treatment for<br>
human patients in need of opioid analgesic therapy using dosage forms prepared in<br>
accordance with the methods disclosed herein.<br>
In accordance with the above objects and others which will be apparent from<br>
the further reading of the specification and of the appended claims, the present<br>
invention is related in part to the surprising discovery that sustained-release oral opioid<br>
analgesic formulations may be prepared utilizing melt extrusion techniques to provide<br>
bioavailable unit dose products which provide analgesia in a patient for, e.g., 8-24<br>
hours..<br>
The invention is also related in part to a new melt-extruded oral sustained-<br>
release dosage forms which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophobic<br>
material, a retardant selected from waxes, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids, and a drug.<br>
More particularly, one aspect of the present invention is related to a<br>
pharmaceutical extrudate including an opioid analgesic dispersed in a matrix.<br>
Preferably, the extrudate is strand or spaghetti-shaped and has a diameter from about<br>
0.1 to about 5 mm. The extrudate is divided into unit doses of the opioid analgesic<br>
for oral administration to a patient, and provides a sustained analgetic effect for 8-24<br>
hours or more.<br>
The matrices preferably include a hydrophobic material and a second retardant<br>
material which acts to further slow or control the release of the therapeutically active<br>
agent when the formulation is exposed to aqueous solutions in-vitro, or exposed to<br>
gastic and/or intestinal fluids.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophobic material is selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkylcelluloses, acrylic and methacrylic acid polymers and copolymers, shellac, zein,<br>
hydrogenated castor oil or hydrogenated vegetable oil, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The retardant material is preferably selected from natural and synthetic waxes,<br>
fatty acids, fatty alcohols and mixtures of the same. Examples include beeswax and<br>
carnauba wax, stearic acid, and stearyl alcohol. This list is of course not meant to be<br>
exclusive.<br>
The extrudate may be cut into multiparticulates by any cutting means known in<br>
the art. Preferably, the multiparticulates have a length of from about 0.1 to 5 mm in<br>
length. The multiparticulates may then be divided into unit doses such that each<br>
individual unit dose includes a dose of opioid analgesic sufficient to provide analgesia<br>
to a mammal, preferably a human patient.<br>
The unit doses of multiparticulates may then be incorporated into a solid<br>
pharmaceutical dosage formulation, e.g. via compression or shaping into tablets, or by<br>
placing a requisite amount inside a gelatin capsule.<br>
The pharmaceutical extrudates of the present invention may be prepared by<br>
blending the drug together with all matrix ingredients (hydrophobic material, binder<br>
and any additional (optional) excipients), feeding the resultant mixture into an extruder<br>
heated to the requisite temperature necessary to melt the mixture; extruding the<br>
viscous, heated mass as a spaghetti-like strand; allowing the extrudate to congeal and<br>
harden, and then dividing the strand into desired pieces. This may be accomplished,<br>
e.g., by cutting the strands into pellets of 1,5 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in length.<br>
 A therapeutically effective amount of an opioid analgesic is dispersed in the<br>
matrix to form a homogeneous mixture. The homogeneous mixture to is extruded to<br>
form the extrudate comprising the opioid analgesic dispersed within a matrix of the<br>
hydrophobic material and the retardant material. In certain preferred embodiments,<br>
the opioid analgesic is homogeneously (uniformly) dispersed throughout the matrix.<br>
Preferably, the extrudate has a diameter of from about 0.1 to about 5 mm and provides<br>
sustained release of said opioid analgesic for a time period of from about 8 to about 24<br>
hours.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to pharmaceutical dosage forms<br>
including the extrudate prepared as outlined above. The extrudate is cut into<br>
multiparticulates using any cutting means known in the art, e.g a blade. The<br>
multiparticulates are then divided into unit doses containing an effective amount of<br>
opioid analgesic to provide analgesia or pain relief in a human patient over the desired<br>
dosing interval. The unit dose of multiparticulates may then be incorporated into<br>
tablets, e.g. via direct compression, or encapsulated by any means known in the art.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating a<br>
patient with sustained-release formulations prepared as described above. This method<br>
includes administering a dosage form containing the novel extrudate to a patient in<br>
need of opioid analgesic therapy. For purposes of the present invention, a unit dose is<br>
understood to contain an effective amount of the therapeuticaily active agent to<br>
produce pain relief and/or analgesia to the patient. One skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that the dose of opioid analgesic administered to a patient will vary due to numerous<br>
factors; e.g. the specific opioid analgesic(s) being administered, the weight and<br>
tolerance of the patient, other therapeutic agents concomitantly being administered,<br>
etc.<br>
As mentioned above, in order for a dosage form to be effective for its intended<br>
purpose, the dosage form must be bioavailable. For purposes of the present invention,<br>
the term "bioavailable" is defined as the total amount of a drug substance that is<br>
absorbed and available to provide the desired therapeutic effect after administration of<br>
a unit dosage form. Generally, the bioavailabifity of a given dosage form is determined<br>
by comparison to a known reference drug product, as commonly determined and<br>
accepted by Governmental Regulatory Agencies, such as the United States FDA.<br>
The term "bioavailability" is defined for purposes of the present invention as<br>
the extent to which the drug (e.g., opioid analgesic) is absorbed from the unit dosage<br>
form and is available at the site of drug action.<br>
The terms "sustained release", "extended duration", and "controlled release"<br>
are defined for purposes of the present invention as the release of the drug (e.g., opioid<br>
analgesic) at such a rate that blood (e.g., plasma) levels are maintained within the<br>
therapeutic range but below toxic levels over a period of time greater than 8 hours,<br>
more preferably for about 12 to about 24 hours, or longer.<br>
The term "unit dose" is defined for purposes of the present invention as the<br>
total amount of multiparticulates needed to administer a desired dose of therapeutically<br>
active agent (e.g., opioid analgesic) to a patient.<br>
The extrudates of the present invention preferably permit release of the opioid<br>
(or salts thereof) over a sustained period of time in an aqueous medium. The term<br>
"aqueous medium" is defined for purposes of the present invention as any water-<br>
containing medium, e.g. water, pharmaceutically acceptable dissolution medium,<br>
gastric fluid and/or intestinal fluid and the like.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the sustained-release dosage forms comprise an<br>
opioid analgesic as the therapeuticaily active agent. In such formulations, the drug is<br>
incorporated into a melt-extruded strand which includes a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
hydrophobic material such as an alkylcellulose or an acrylic polymer or copolymer;<br>
together with a suitable plasticizer, alternatively (preferably) together with an<br>
additional retardant material that has binding properties, such as a wax, a fatty acid<br>
and/or a fatty alcohol; and any further pharmaeutical excipients known to those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to improved melt extruded matrices<br>
which comprise a hydrophobic material and a fatty binder such as previously specified.<br>
In accordance therewith, a therapeutically active agent is combined with one or more<br>
suitable hydrophobic materials and a further retardant material is extruded to form an<br>
extrudate. The extrudate may then be cut into multiparticulates which are<br>
subsequently incorporated into sustained release dosage forms.<br>
Tharapeutically Active Agents<br>
Therapeutically active agents which may be used in accordance with the<br>
present invention include both water soluble and water insoluble drugs. Examples of<br>
such therapeutically active agents include antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate,<br>
diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and dexchlorpheniramine maleate), analgesics<br>
(e.g.', aspirin, codeine, morphine, dihydromorphone, oxycodone, etc.), non-steroidal<br>
anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin, ibuprofen,<br>
sulindac), anti-emetics (e.g., metoclopramide, methylnaltrexone), anti-epileptics (e.g.,<br>
phenytoin, meprobamate and nitrazepam), vasodilators (e.g., nifedipine, papaverine,<br>
diltiazem and nicardipine), anti-tussive agents and expectorants (e.g., codeine<br>
phosphate), anti-asthmatics (e.g. theophylline), antacids, anti-spasmodics (e.g.<br>
atropine, scopolamine), antidiabetics (e.g., insulin), diuretics (e.g., ethacrynic acid,<br>
bendrofluthiazide), anti-hypotensives (e.g., propranolol, clonidine), antihypertensives<br>
(e.g, cionidine, methyldopa), bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol), steroids (e.g.,<br>
hydrocortisone, triamcinolone, prednisone), antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline),<br>
antihemorrhoidais, hypnotics, psychotropics, antidiarrheals, mucolytics, sedatives,<br>
decongestants, laxatives, vitamins, stimulants (including appetite suppressants such as<br>
phenylpropanolamine), as well as salts, hydrates, and solvates of the same.<br>
In embodiments of the invention directed to opioid analgesics, the opioid<br>
analgesics used in accordance with the present invention include alfentanil, allylpro-<br>
dine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzyl morphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine,<br>
butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, cyclazocine, desomorphine, dextromoramide,<br>
dezocine, diampromide, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimephep-<br>
tanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, etho-<br>
heptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene fentanyl, heroin,<br>
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone,<br>
levallorphan, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol,<br>
metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine,<br>
nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone,<br>
opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone,<br>
phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, propheptazine,<br>
promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tramadol, tilidine, salts<br>
thereof, mixtures of any of the foregoing, mixed mu-agonists/antagonists, mu-<br>
antagonist combinations, and the like. The opioid analgesic may be in the form of the<br>
free base, or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable complex.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the opioid analgesic is selected from<br>
morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine,<br>
dihydromorphine, oxymorphone, tramadol or mixtures thereof.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the sustained-release opioid oral dosage form of<br>
the present invention includes hydromorphone as the therapeutically active ingredient<br>
in an amount from about 4 to about 64 mg hydromorphone hydrochloride.<br>
Alternatively, the dosage form may contain molar equivalent amounts of other hydro-<br>
morphone salts or of the hydromorphone base. In other preferred embodiments where<br>
the opioid analgesic is other than hydromorphone, the dosage form contains an<br>
appropriate amount to provide a substantially equivalent therapeutic effect. For<br>
example, when the opioid analgesic comprises morphine, the sustained-release oral<br>
dosage forms of the present invention include from about 5 mg to about 800 mg<br>
morphine, by weight (based on morphine sulfate). When the opioid analgesic<br>
comprises oxycodone, the sustained-release oral dosage forms of the present invention<br>
include from about 5 mg to about 400 mg oxycodone. When the opioid analgesic is<br>
tramadol, the sustained-release oral dosage forms of the invention include from about<br>
50 mg to about 800 mg tramadol by weight, based on the hydrochloride salt.<br>
The sustained-release dosage forms of the present invention generally achieve<br>
and maintain therapeutic levels substantially without significant increases in the<br>
intensity and/or degree of concurrent side effects, such as nausea, vomiting or<br>
drowsiness, which are often associated with high blood levels of opioid analgesics.<br>
There is also evidence to suggest that the use of the present dosage forms leads to a<br>
reduced risk of drug addiction.<br>
In the present invention, the oral opioid analgesics have been formulated to<br>
provide for an increased duration of analgesic. Surprisingly, these formulations, at<br>
comparable daily dosages of conventional immediate-release drug, are associated with<br>
a lower incidence in severity of adverse drug reactions and can also be administered at<br>
a lower daily dose than conventional oral medication while maintaining pain control.<br>
When the therapeutically active agent included in the dosage forms of the<br>
present invention is an opioid analgesic, the dosage form may further include one or<br>
more additional which may or may not act synergistically with the opioid analgesics of<br>
the present invention. Examples of such additional therapeutically active agents<br>
include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including ibuprofen, diclofenac,<br>
naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen,<br>
piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen,<br>
aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac,<br>
tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac,<br>
mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid tolfenamic acid,<br>
diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam or isoxicam, and the like. Other suitable<br>
additional drugs which may be included in the dosage forms of the present invention<br>
include acetaminophen, aspirin, salicylate-derived analgesics and antipyretics or salts<br>
thereof, and other non-opioid analgesics.<br>
The additional (non-opioid) therapeutically active agent may be included in<br>
controlled release form or in immediate release form. The additional drug may be<br>
incorporated into the controlled release matrix along with the opioid; incorporated as a<br>
separated controlled release layer or immediate release layer; or may be incorporated<br>
as a powder, granulation, etc., in a gelatin capsule with the extrudates of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Matrix Ingredients<br>
The extrudates of the present invention include at least one hydrophobic<br>
material. The hydrophobic material will preferably impart sustained release of the<br>
opioid analgesic to the final formulation. Preferred hydrophobic materials which may<br>
be used in accordance with the present invention include alkylcelluloses such as natural<br>
or synthetic celluloses derivatives (e.g. ethylcellulose), acrylic and methacrylic acid<br>
polymers and copolymers, shellac, zein, wax-type substances including hydrogenated<br>
castor- oil or hydrogenated vegetable oil, or mixtures thereof. This list is not meant to<br>
be exclusive, and any pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophobic material which is<br>
capable of imparting sustained release of the active agent and which melts (or softens<br>
to the extent necessary to be extruded) may be used in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic<br>
material is a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic polymer, including but not limited to<br>
acrylic acid and methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate copolymers, ethoxyethyl methacrylates, cynaoethyl methacrylate,<br>
aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid),<br>
methacrylic acid alkylamine copoiymer, poly(methyl metliacrylate), poly(methacrylic<br>
acid)(anhydride), polymethacrylate, polyacrylamide, poly(methacrylic acid anhydride),<br>
and glycidyl methacrylate copolymers. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic<br>
material is selected from materials such as hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and mixtures of the foregoing.<br>
The retardant material may consist of one or more water-insoluble wax-like<br>
thermoplastic substances possibly mixed with one or more wax-like thermoplastic<br>
substances being less hydrophobic than said one or more water-insoluble wax-like<br>
substances. In order to achieve constant release, the individual wax-like substances in<br>
the binder material should be substantially non-degradable and insoluble in<br>
gastrointestinal fluids during the initial release phases.<br>
Useful water-insoluble wax-like substances may be those with a water-<br>
solubility that is lower than about 1:5,000 (w/w).<br>
Retardant materials are preferably water-insoluble with more or less<br>
pronounced hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic trends. Preferably, the retardant materials<br>
useful in the invention have a melting point from about 30 to about IOO°C, preferably<br>
from about 45 to about 90°C. Specifically, the retardant material may comprise<br>
natural or synthetic waxes , fatty alcohols (such as lauryl, myristyl stearyl, cetyl or<br>
preferably cetostearyl alcool), fatty acids, including but not limited to fatty acid esters,<br>
fatty acid glycerides (mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides), hydrogenated fats, hydrocarbons,<br>
normal waxes, stearic aid, stearyl alcohol and hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers<br>
having hydrocarbon backbones. Suitable waxes include, for example, beeswax,<br>
glycowax, castor wax and carnauba wax. For purposes of the present invention, a<br>
wax-like substance is defined as any material which is normally solid at room<br>
temperature and has a melting point of from about 30 to about 100°C.<br>
Suitable retardant materials which may be used in accordance with the present<br>
invention include digestible, long chain (C8.C50, especially C12-C40), substituted or<br>
unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, glyceryl esters of fatty<br>
acids, mineral and vegetable oils and natural and synthetic waxes. Hydrocarbons<br>
having a melting point of between 25° and 90°C are preferred. Of the long chain<br>
hydrocarbon materials, fatty (aliphatic) alcohols are preferred in certain embodiments..<br>
The oral dosage form may contain up to 60% (by weight) of at least one digestible,<br>
long chain hydrocarbon.<br>
In addition to the above ingredients, a sustained-release matrix may also<br>
contain suitable quantities of other materials, e.g., diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
granulating aids, colorants, flavorants and glidants that are conventional in the<br>
pharmaceutical art. The quantities of these additional materials will be sufficient to<br>
provide the desired effect to the desired formulation. In addition to the above<br>
ingredients, a sustained-release matrix incorporating melt-extruded multiparticulates<br>
may also contain suitable quantities of other materials, e.g. diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
granulating aids, colorants, flavorants and glidants that are conventional in the<br>
pharmaceutical art in amounts up to about 50% by weight of the particulate if desired.<br>
Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that may be<br>
used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical<br>
Excipients. American Pharmaceutical Association (1986), incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
In order to facilitate the preparation of a solid, sustained-release oral dosage<br>
form according to this invention there is provided, in a further aspect of the present<br>
invention, a process for the preparation of a solid, sustained-release oral dosage form<br>
according to the present invention comprising incorporating opioids or a salt thereof in<br>
a sustained-release melt-extruded matrix. Incorporation in the matrix may be effected,<br>
for example, blending the opioid analgesic, together with at least one hydrophobic<br>
material and preferably the additional retardant material to obtain a homogeneous<br>
mixture. The homogeneous mixture is then heated to a temperature sufficient to at<br>
least soften the mixture sufficiently to extrude the same. The resulting homogeneous<br>
mixture is then extruded, e.g., using a twin-screw extruder, to form strands. The<br>
extrudate is preferably cooled and cut into multiparttculates by any means known in the<br>
art. The strands are cooled and cut into multiparttculates. The multiparttculates are<br>
then divided into unit doses. The extrudate preferably has a diameter of from about<br>
0.1 to about 5 mm and provides sustained release of the therapeutically active agent<br>
for a time period of from about 8 to about 24 hours.<br>
An optional process for preparing the melt extrusions, multiparticulates and<br>
unit doses of the present invention includes directly metering into an extruder a water-<br>
insoluble retardant, a therapeutically active agent, and an optional binder; heating said<br>
homogenous mixture; extruding said homogenous mixture to thereby form strands;<br>
cooling said strands containing said homogeneous mixture; and cutting said strands<br>
into particles having a size from about 0.1 mm to about 12 mm; and dividing said<br>
particles into unit doses. In this aspect of the invention, a relatively continuous<br>
manufacturing procedure is realized.<br>
The diameter of the extruder aperture or exit port can also be adjusted to vary<br>
the thickness of the extruded strands. Furthermore, the exit part of the extruder need<br>
not be round; it can be oblong, rectangular, etc. The exiting strands can be reduced to<br>
particles using a hot wire cutter, guillotine, etc.<br>
The melt extruded multiparticulate system can be, for example, in the form of<br>
granules, spheroids or pellets depending upon the extruder exit orifice. For purposes<br>
of the present invention, the terms "melt-extruded multiparticulate(s)" and "melt-<br>
extruded multiparticulate system(s)" and "melt-extruded particles" shall refer to a<br>
plurality of units, preferably within a range of similar size and/or shape and containing<br>
one or more active agents and one or more excipients, preferably including a retardant<br>
as described herein. In this regard, the melt-extruded multiparticulates will be of a<br>
range of from about 0.1 to about 12 mm in length and have a diameter of from about<br>
0.1 to about 5 mm. In addition, it is to be understood that the melt-extruded multipar-<br>
ticulates can be any geometrical shape within this size range such as beads,<br>
microspheres, seeds, pellets, etc.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, oral dosage forms are prepared to include an<br>
effective amount of melt-extruded multiparticulates within a capsule. For example, a<br>
plurality of the melt-extruded multiparticulates may be placed in a gelatin capsule in an<br>
amount sufficient to provide an effective sustained-release dose when ingested and<br>
contacted by gastric fluid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a suitable amount of the multiparticulate<br>
extrudate is compressed into an oral tablet using conventional tableting equipment<br>
using standard techniques.<br>
Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded),<br>
capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences. (Arthur Osol, editor), 1553-1593 (1980), incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
• In yet another preferred embodiment, the extrudate can be shaped into tablets<br>
as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,957,681 (Klimesch, et. al.), described in addtional<br>
detail above and hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Optionally, the sustained-release melt-extruded multiparticulate systems or<br>
tablets can be coated, or the gelatin capsule can be further coated, with a sustained-<br>
release coating comprising one of the hydrophobic materials described above. Such<br>
coatings preferably include a sufficient amount of hydrophobic material to obtain a<br>
weight gain level from about 2 to about 30 percent, although the overcoat may be<br>
greater depending upon the physical properties of the particular opioid analgesic<br>
compound utilized and the desired release rate, among other things. In certain<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic polymer comprising<br>
the sustained-release coating is a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic polymer, such as<br>
those described hereinabove. The solvent which is used for the hydrophobic material<br>
in the coating may be any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, including water,<br>
methanol, ethanol, methylene chloride and mixtures thereof.<br>
The unit dosage forms of the present invention may further include<br>
combinations of melt-extruded multiparticulates containing one or more of the<br>
therapeutically active agents disclosed above before being encapsulated. Furthermore,<br>
the unit dosage forms can also include an amount of an immediate release<br>
therapeutically active agent, for prompt therapeutic effect. The immediate release<br>
therapeutically active agent may be incorporated, e.g., as separate pellets within a.<br>
gelatin capsule, or may be coated on the surface of the compressed tablet which has<br>
been prepared from the multiparticulate extrudate as set forth above.<br>
The controlled-release formulations of the present invention slowly release the<br>
therapeutically active agent, e.g., when ingested and exposed to gastric fluids, and then<br>
to intestinal fluids. The controlled-release profile of the melt-extruded formulations of<br>
the invention can be altered, for example, by varying the amount of retardant, i.e.,<br>
hydrophobic polymer, by varying the amount of plasticizer relative to hydrophobic<br>
polymer, by the inclusion of additional ingredients or excipients, by altering the method<br>
of manufacture, etc. In certain embodiments of the invention, the the sustained-release<br>
dosage forms of the present invention preferably release the therapeutically active<br>
agent at a rate that is independent of pH, e.g., between pH 1.6 and 7.2. In other<br>
embodiments, the formulations can be designed to provide a pH-dependent release of<br>
the therapeutically active agent.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the melt extruded material is prepared<br>
without the inclusion of the therapeutically active agent, which is added therafter to the<br>
extrudate. Such formulations typically will have the therapeutically active agent<br>
blended together with the extruded matrix material, and then the mixture would be<br>
tabletted in order to provide a slow release formulation. Such formulations may be<br>
advantageous, for example, when the therapeutically active agent included in the<br>
formulation is sensitive to temperatures needed for softening the hydrophobic material<br>
and/ or the retardant material.<br>
Opioid Analgesic Formulations<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the invention is directed to sustained-release<br>
oral opioid formulations which are administrable on a once-a-day basis, and which are<br>
prepared from the melt extrudates described herein. Such dosage forms will provide<br>
an in-vitro release (when assessed by the USP Paddle or Basket Method at 100 prm at<br>
900 ml aqueous buffer (pH between 1.6 and 7.2) at 37°C from about 1 to about<br>
42.5% opioid released after one hour, from about 5 to about 65% opioid released after<br>
2 hours, from about 15 to about 85% opioid released after 4 hours, from about 20 to<br>
about 90% opioid released after 6 hours, from about 3 5 to about 95% opioid released<br>
after 12 hours, from about 45 to about 100% opioid released after 18 hours, and from<br>
about.5 5 to about 100% opioid released after 24 hours, by weight. Such formulations<br>
may further be characterized by a peak plasma level at from about 2 to about 8 hours<br>
after oral administration, and preferably from about 4 to about 6 hours after<br>
administration. Such formulations are further characterized by a W50 from about 4 to<br>
about 12 hours.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the oral 24 hour sustained-release opioid<br>
dosage form provides a rapid rate of initial rise in the plasma concentration of the<br>
opioid after oral administration, such that the peak plasma level obtained in-vivo<br>
occurs from about 2 to about 8 hours after oral administration, and/or the absorption<br>
half-life is from about 1 to about 8 hours after oral administration (in the fasted state).<br>
More preferably in this embodiment the absorption half-life is 1-6 hours and possibly<br>
1-3 hours after oral administration (in the fasted state). Such formulations provide an<br>
in-vitro dissolution under the conditions specified above, from about 12.5 to about<br>
42.5% opioid released after one hour, from about 25 to about 65% opioid released<br>
after 2 hours, from about 45 to about 85% opioid released after 4 hours, and greater<br>
than about 60% opioid released after 8 hours, by weight.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention.<br>
They are not to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever.<br>
MELT-EXTRUSION TECHNIQUES<br>
Typical melt extrusion systems capable of carrying-out the present invention<br>
include a suitable extruder drive motor having variable speed and constant torque<br>
control, start-stop controls, and ammeter. In addition, the system will include a<br>
temperature control console which includes temperature sensors, cooling means and<br>
temperature indicators throughout the length of the extruder. In addition, the system<br>
will include an extruder such as twin-screw extruder which consists of two counter-<br>
rotating intermeshing screws enclosed within a cylinder or barrel having an aperture or<br>
die at the exit thereof. The feed materials enter through a feed hopper and is moved<br>
through the barrel by the screws and is forced through the die into strands which are<br>
thereafter conveyed such as by a continuous movable belt to allow for cooling and<br>
being directed to a pelletizer or other suitable device to render the extruded ropes into<br>
the multiparticulate system. The pelletizer can consist of rollers, fixed knife, rotating<br>
cutter and the like. Suitable instruments and systems are available from distributors<br>
such as C.W Brabender Instruments, Inc. of South Hackensack, New Jersey. Other<br>
suitable apparatus will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
General Pellet Manufacturing Procedure<br>
The following technique was used to manufacture the extrudate and<br>
multiparticulates for Examples 1-26:<br>
Blend the required amount of drug, hydrophobic material and binder along with<br>
any additional excipients.<br>
Charge a powder feeder with proper amount of drug/ excipient blend.<br>
Set temperatures of extruder heating zones to the required temperature,<br>
depending on the formulation. Typically, the temperature should be set at about 83°<br>
C. Wait until the corresponding heating zones reach steady temperatures. Set the<br>
extruder screw rotation speed to 20 rpm. Start the feeder, the conveyor and the<br>
pelletizer. After the excipients are melted and the drug is embedded in the molten<br>
mixture, the resultant viscous mass is extruded as spaghetti-like strands. The diameter<br>
of the extruder aperture can be adjusted to vary the thickness of the resulting strand.<br>
Set the conveyor belt speed to an appropriate speed (e.g., 3-100 ft/min).<br>
Allow the extruded semisolid strand(s) to be congealed and/or hardened while<br>
transported to the pelletizer on the conveyor belt. Additional cooling devices may be<br>
needed to ensure proper congealing. (The conveyor belt may not be needed to cool<br>
the strand, if the material congeals rapidly enough.)<br>
, Set the roller knife to an appropriate speed (e.g., to 3-100 ft/min and 100-800<br>
rpm). Cut the congealed strands to desired size (e.g., 3-5 mm in diameter, 0.3-5 mm in<br>
length).<br>
Collect the pellet product.<br>
Fill a desired weight of pellets into hard gelatin capsules to obtain an<br>
appropriate doses of the drug.<br>
Dissolution Method<br>
The following dissolution method was used to obtain dissolution profiles for<br>
the dosage forms of Examples 1-25:<br>
(USP II Paddle at 100 rpm at 37°C)<br>
Media - 1st hour in 700 ml simulated gastric fluid (SGF), pH 1.2 without enzyme<br>
thereafter, 900 ml simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), pH 7.5 without enzyme<br>
Using HPLC procedures for assay<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention.<br>
They are not meant to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-2<br>
CONTROLLED RELEASE CHLORPHENIRAMINE FORMULATIONS<br>
In these examples, chlorpheniramine maleate controlled release pellets were<br>
prepared according to the above manufacturing procedure using ethylcellulose and an<br>
acrylic polymer (Eudragit RSPO), respectively as the retardant. The formulations are<br>
set forth in Tables 1 and 2 below. The dissolution of these formulations is set forth in<br>
Figure 1. Drug release rate from ethylcellulose pellets (prepared at 105°C) is<br>
significantly slower than that from Eudragit RSPO pellets (prepared at 85CC).<br>
The drug release rate of Example 3 was slower than expected especially during<br>
later hours of the dissolution.<br>
Ex. 4-5 Examples 4-5 were prepared in accordance with Example 3<br>
above. To increase the drug dissolution rate during later hours, varying amounts of<br>
Eudragit L-100 were incorporated in the formulation. The drug dissolution rate<br>
increases with increasing amount of Eudragit L-100 in the formulation. The morphine<br>
sulfate capsule formulation are set forth in tables 4-6 below:<br>
Ex. 6. A sustained release morphine sulfate formulation was prepared<br>
having the ingredients listed in Table 6 below:<br>
The formulation of Example 6 was prepared as follows:<br>
Pellet Manufacture<br>
a. Extruder system description- The twin screw extruder is consisted of a pair of<br>
counterrotating screws and a barrel block equipped with heating/cooling zones. The<br>
extrudate is delivered to a pelletizer through a conveyor belt and cut into pellets of the<br>
desirable size.<br>
b. ' Manufacturing procedure-<br>
1. Blend the drug and all the excipients in a proper mixer.<br>
2. Place the mixture in a powder feeder.<br>
3. Set temperatures of the extruder heating zones to approximately 83°C.<br>
4. Set the extruder screw rotation speed to 20 rpm.<br>
5. Start the feeder, the conveyor and the pelletizer.<br>
6. After the excipients are melted and the drug embedded in the molten mixture,<br>
the viscous mass is extruded as spaghetti-like strands.<br>
7. The extrudate is congealed and hardened while being delivered to the pelletizer<br>
on the conveyor belt.<br>
8. The roller knife of the pelletizer cuts the strands into pellets of 1.5 mm in<br>
diameter and 1.5 mm in length.<br>
Encapsulation<br>
After the pellets were manufactured, 120 mg of pellets are encapsulated in size<br>
#2 hard gelatin capsules, rendering capsules containing 60 mg of morphine sulfate.<br>
These capsules were then tested using the following dissolution methodology:<br>
The capsules of Example 6 were found to have the following dissolution<br>
results:<br>
As seen in Figure 3, the drug dissolution rate obtained from the product of Ex.<br>
3 showed a significant pH dependency. The release rate was slower in S1F (simulated<br>
intestinal fluid) than in SGF (simulated gastric fluid).<br>
In Figure 4, it can be seen that due to the addition of Eudragit L-100, the drug<br>
dissolution rate obtained from Ex. 6 was less pH dependent. The drug release rate was<br>
faster in SIF during later hours of dissolution which is desirable for complete<br>
bioavailability.<br>
EXAMPLES 7-8<br>
As demonstrated in Fig. 5, with proper choice of plasticizers, the drug release<br>
rate from the formula containing Eudragit L-100 can be reduced. This may be<br>
necessary to achieve desirable plasma drug concentration profiles after oral<br>
administration of the pellets.<br>
EXAMPLES 9-10<br>
A different polymer/wax combination was used as an alternative formulation.<br>
As seen in Figure 6, the drug dissolution rate from ethylcellulose/polyviny! acetate<br>
phthalate was somewhat faster.<br>
EXAMPLES 11-14<br>
CONTROLLED RELEASE OXYCODONE FORMULATIONS<br>
The formula used in Ex. 6 was applied to oxycodone hydrochloride. Due to<br>
the higher potency of oxycodone, only 20 mg of drug was used. The missing 40 mg<br>
was replaced by 40 mg of talc (Ex. 12). No replacement was used in Ex. 11. When<br>
tested in only SGF or SlF, the use of Eudragit L causes the formulation to become less<br>
pH dependent. The results are shown in Figure 7.<br>
The pellet manufacturing procedure and the dissolution method are the same as<br>
described in Example 6.<br>
The above capsules were found to have the dissolution results set forth in Table<br>
lla below:<br>
Ex- 13 Oxycodone HC1 once-a-day capsules were produced with the<br>
following formula using the technology described in Example 6. The formulation is set<br>
forth in Table 13 below.<br>
The pellet manufacturing procedure is the same as described in Example 6.<br>
However, 80 mg of pellets were encapsulated to contain 20 mg of oxycodone HCL.<br>
The above capsules were tested using the following dissolution methodology:<br>
1. Apparatus-USP type II (paddle), 100rpm at 37°C<br>
2. Media- Either 900 ml simulated gastric fluid (SGF), pH 1.2 without enzyme;<br>
or 900 ml simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), pH 7.5 without enzyme.<br>
3. Analytical method- High performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The dissolution results are set forth in Table 13a below:<br>
Ex, 14 To prepare an oxycodone HC1 controlled release tablet which<br>
would dissolve preferentially in a lower pH, the following formula is used:<br>
Total Manufacture<br>
1. Mix Eudragit RS30D (suspension) and Triacetin for 5 minutes.<br>
2. Place spray dried lactose, oxycodone HCI, PVP, in a fluid bed drier.<br>
3. Spray the suspension onto the powders under fluidization.<br>
4. Pass the granulation through a Comil to reduce lumps.<br>
5. Melt stearyl alcohol at 70°C.<br>
6. Incorporate the molten stearyl alcohol into the dry granulation in a Collete<br>
Mixer.<br>
7. Transfer the waxed granulation to a cooling tray and allow the granulation to<br>
congeal.<br>
8. Pass the granulation through a Comil.<br>
9. Mix the waxed granulation with talc and magnesium stearate in a Collete<br>
Mixer.<br>
10. Compress the lubricated granulation into tablets using a rotary tablet press.<br>
11. Film coat the tablets.<br>
These tablets were then tested using the following dissolution methodology<br>
described in Example 13.<br>
The above tablets were found to have the following dissolution results:<br>
EXAMPLES 15-19<br>
CONTROLLED RELEASE HYDROMORPHONE FORMULATIONS<br>
Ex. 15-16 The formula used in Ex. 6 was applied to hydromorphone<br>
hydrochloride. Due to the higher potency of hydromorphone, only &amp; trig of drug was<br>
used. The missing 52 mg was replaced by 52 mg of talc (Ex. 16) or 52 mg of<br>
excipients (Ex. 15). The results are shown in Figure 8.<br>
Ex. 17 Hydromorphone HC1 once-a-day capsules were produced with<br>
the formula set forth in Table 17 below using the technology described in Example 6.<br>
The pellet manufacturing procedure is the same as described in Example 6.<br>
However, pellets of 1.0 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in length were prepared. Each<br>
capsule holds 80 mg of pellets and contains 8 mg of hydromorphone HCL.<br>
The above capsules were tested using the dissolution methodology described in<br>
Example 6.<br>
The above capsules were found to have the dissolution results set forth in Table<br>
17a below:<br>
Ex. 18 Hydromorphone HC1 once-a-day capsules were produced with<br>
the formula set forth in Table 18 below as the second example of the technology<br>
described in Example 6.<br>
The pellet manufacturing procedure and the dissolution method are the same as<br>
described in Example 6<br>
The above capsules were found to have the dissolution results set forth in<br>
Table 18a below<br>
Ex. 19 Hydromorphone HC1 once-a-day capsules were produced with<br>
the following formula according to the method described Example 6.<br>
The manufacturing procedure of the pellets and the dissolution method are the<br>
same as described in Example 6.<br>
The above capsules were found to have the following dissolution results:<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
In this Example, a bioavailability study was undertaken. Fourteen subjects were given<br>
the morphine sulfate formulations of Example 3. The results are provided in Table 20<br>
below in Figure 10.<br>
From the above data, it can be seen that the formulation is an ideal candidate<br>
for an extended release or once-a-day product without a food effect.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Bioavailability of morphine sulfate melt extrusion imltiparticulate 60 ing<br>
capsules.<br>
A bioavailability study of morphine capsules of Example 6 was conducted in 12<br>
normal male volunteers. Capsules of 60 mg in strength were administered either with<br>
or without food in a single dose, two-way crossover study. Blood samples were taken<br>
periodically and assayed for morphine concentrations using gas chromatography with<br>
mass detection (G/MS). From the data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters<br>
were calculated and are indicated in Table 20 below.<br>
When compared to the typical blood levels of MS Contin®, a single dose<br>
twice-a-day marketed morphine sulfate 30 mg tablets, in the fasted state, it can be seen<br>
that the capsules of Example 6 are suitable for once daily administration. At the 24th<br>
hour the blood levels are well above MS-Contin and within the therapeutic range<br>
(Figure 11).<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
Bioavailability of OXY-MEM 20 ing capsules.<br>
A bioavailability study of oxycodone capsules of examples 11 and 13 was<br>
conducted in 10 normal male volunteers. Capsules of example 13 were administered<br>
either with or without food. Capsules of example 11 were administered without food.<br>
The study was conducted in a single dose, four-way crossover design. Blood samples<br>
were taken periodically and assayed for oxycodone concentrations using gas<br>
chromatography with mass detection (G/MS).<br>
From the data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated as<br>
set forth in Table 22 below:<br>
From the above data, it can be concluded that both Examples 11 and 13, but<br>
particularly Example 13, are suitable for once daily administration. This is shown<br>
graphically in Figure 12.<br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
Bioavailability of Example 14 Tablets.<br>
A bioavailability study of oxycodone controlled release tablets of example 14<br>
was conducted in 25 normal volunteers. These tablets were administered either with<br>
or without food. The study was conducted in a single dose, randomized crossover<br>
design. Blood samples were taken periodically and assayed for oxycodone<br>
concentrations using gas chromatography with mass detection (GC/MS). The plasma<br>
oxycodone concentration versus time curves are shown in Figure 13.<br>
From the data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that the controlled release oxycodone HC1<br>
preparation, which dissolved preferentially in low pH, does not show substantial food<br>
effect. From the Cmax data, it can be seen that there is no significant change in blood<br>
oxycodone levels when the drug was taken with food than without food<br>
(35.3/39.3=09). From the AUC (area under the curve) data, it appears that the<br>
amount of drug absorbed with or without food is similar (416/422=0.986).<br>
EXAMPLE 24<br>
Bioavailability of HH-MEM 8 mg capsules.<br>
A bioavailability study of hydromorphone capsules of Examples 17 and 18 was<br>
conducted using a single dose, five-way crossover study in 12 normal male volunteers.<br>
The subjects received either 8 mg of Dilaudid tablet (immediate release) or 8 mg of<br>
HH-MEM capsules. Dilaudid tablets were administered after an overnight fast. MEM<br>
capsules were administered with or without food. Blood samples were taken<br>
periodically and assayed for hydromorphone concentrations using gas chromatography<br>
with mass detection (G/MS). From the data, the following pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters were calculated.<br>
From the above data, both formulations 17 and 18 would be suitable for once-<br>
a-day administration both not having a food effect, and in fact Example 17 looks ideal.<br>
The data of Example 17 is shown graphically in Figure 14 and the data of Example 18<br>
is shown graphically in Figure 15.<br>
EXAMPLE 25<br>
Steady State Bioavailability of HH-MEM 8 mg capsules.<br>
To assess steady state plasma levels and the effect of food on hydromorphoae,<br>
a single dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in 12 normal male volunteers.<br>
The subjects received either 4 mg of Dilaudid (immediate release) every 6 hours or 16<br>
mg of the capsules according to Example 17 every 24 hours. Venous blood samples<br>
were taken at predetermined time points. The plasma hydromorphone concentrations<br>
were quantitated using gas chromatography with mass detection (G/MS).<br>
From the data from day 4, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were<br>
calculated and are set forth in Table 25 below.<br>
The results are shown graphically in Figure 16. From this data it can be seen<br>
that Example 17 is an ideal product for once-a-day administration for either single dose<br>
or multiple dose administration.<br>
EXAMPLE 26<br>
Bioavailability of HH-MEM 8 mg capsules.<br>
To assess bioavailability and effect of food on hydromorphone MEM capsules,<br>
a single dose, three-way crossover study was conducted in 12 normal male volunteers.<br>
The subjects received either 8 mg of Dilaudid tablet (immediate release) or 8 mg of<br>
HH-MEM (Example 19.) Dilaudid tablets were administered after an overnight fast.<br>
MEM capsules were administered with or without food. Venous blood samples were<br>
taken at predetermined at time points. The plasma hydromorphone concentrations<br>
were quantitated using gas chromatography with mass detection (G/MS).<br>
From the data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and<br>
are set forth in Table 26 below.<br>
From the above data it can be concluded that a once-a-day Hydromorphone<br>
product can be produced using other ingredients than are used for Examples 17 and<br>
18. This data is shown graphically in Figure 17.<br>
EXAMPLE 27<br>
Tramadol HOl 200 mg SR Tablet<br>
The following formula is used to prepare melt extrusion granulation and tablet.<br>
Granulation Manufacture<br>
a. Extruder system description- The twin screw extruder is consisted of a pair of<br>
counterrotating screws and a barrel block equipped with heating/cooling zones. The<br>
stranded extrudate is congealed on a conveyor belt and cut into pellets of the desirable<br>
size.<br>
b. Manufacturing procedure-<br>
1.Blend the drug and all the excipients in a proper mixer.<br>
2.Place the mixture in a powder feeder.<br>
3. Set temperatures of the extruder heating zones to approximately 65 °C.<br>
4.Set the extruder screw rotation speed to 40 rpm.<br>
5. Start the feeder and the conveyor.<br>
6. After the excipients are melted and the drug embedded in the molten mixture, the<br>
viscous mass is extruded as spaghetti-like strands.<br>
7.The extrudate is congealed and hardened while being carried away on a conveyor<br>
belt.<br>
8.The stranded extrudate was cut into pellets of 2 mm in diameter and 2-8 cm in<br>
length.<br>
Tabletting<br>
The pellets were milled into granules through a suitable screen. The granulation was<br>
blended with talc and magnesium stearate. The mixture was then compressed into<br>
capsule-shaped tablets.<br>
Dissolution Method<br>
1. Apparatus- USP Type II (paddle), 100 rpm at 37°C.<br>
2. The tablet was placed in a tablet sinker clip and immersed in each vessel.<br>
3. Media- 900 ml pH 6.5 phosphate buffer.<br>
4. Analytical method- High performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The above tablets were found to have the following dissolution results:<br>
EXAMPLE 28<br>
Tramadol HC1 200 mg SR Tablet<br>
The following formula is used to prepare melt extrusion granulation and tablet with a<br>
slower dissolution profile than example 27.<br>
The manufacturing procedure and dissolution method are the same as described<br>
in example 27. Additional dissolution media used include pH 1.2 simulated gastric fluid<br>
(SGF) without enzyme, pH 7.5 simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) without enzyme, and<br>
pH 4 phosphate buffer.<br>
The above tablets were found to have the following dissolution results:<br>
The results show that the dissolution profiles of Tramadol SR tablets in media<br>
of different pH values are similar. Based on our experience with similar formulae of<br>
other opiates, a formula which demonstrates pH independent dissolution profile would<br>
provide a consistent drug release profile in vivo without food effect.<br>
