Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawing<br>
Fig 1 illustrates a reaction scheme for preparing para-chloro benzoic acid from 4-chloro-2'-hydroxybenzophenone (o-CHBP).<br>
 <br>
Detailed Description<br>
4-Chloro-4'-hydroxybenzophenone is prepared in high yield by reacting p-chlorobenzoyl chloride with phenol. However during the process, around 1 to 10 % of the isomer 4-chloro-2'-hydroxy benzophenone is formed. The isomer is isolated by the process such as distillation and crystallization.<br>
The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation is an organic reaction in which a ketone is oxidized to an ester by treatment with peroxy acids or hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation can be applied to 4-chloro-2'-hydroxy benzophenone. 4-chloro-2'-hydroxy benzophenone is subjected to Baeyer Villiger oxidation reaction to yield an ester which is then further hydrolyzed to convert it in to simpler and useful compounds.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for preparing para-chloro benzoic acid from4-chloro-2'-hydroxy benzophenone<br>
4-Chlorobenzoic acid is a useful intermediate for manufacturing dyes, fungicides, pharmaceuticals and other organic chemicals. It is also used as a preservative in adhesives and paints.<br>
In accordance with the process of the present invention, 4-chloro-2' -hydroxy benzophenone (formula I) is alkylated to yield an ether 2'-alkoxy-4-chloro benzophenone of (formula II). The alkylation is carried out using an alkylating agent. Various alkylating agents can be used such as alkyl<br>
 <br>
sulfonates, trialkyl phosphates, dialkyl sulfites, alkyl sulfates and alkyl halides.<br>
 <br>
wherein R represents an alkyl group,<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the alkylation is carried out using an alkyl sulfate. The alkyl sulfates usually preferred are dimethyl sulfate, diisopropyl sulfate and diethyl sulfate.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the alkylation is carried out using alkyl halide. The alkyl halides usually preferred are methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, propyl and butyl halide.<br>
Baeyer Villegar oxidation of 2'-alkoxy-4-chloro benzophenone yields an ester 2'-alkoxy phenyl-4-chlorobenzoate (formula III). The reaction is carried out under mild condition. During the process 4-chlorophenyl-2'-alkoxy benzoate (Formula IIIA) is also formed as byproduct.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Formula III	Formula IIIA<br>
The ester is then hydrolyzed to yield salts of p-chlorobenzoic acid (formula V).<br>
 <br>
Formula (V)<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, 4-chloro-2'-hydroxy benzophenone is methylated to 4-chloro-2,-methoxy benzophenone. 4-chloro-2'-methoxy benzophenone so formed is then oxidized to 2'-methoxyphenyl-4-chlorobenzoate. The oxidation step is carried out in the presence of peroxy acids formed in-situ by reaction of hydrogen peroxide and per-acetic acid. The oxidation reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 10°C to 50°C. During oxidation process, 4-chlorophenyl-2'-methoxy benzoate is also formed. The ratio of 2'-methoxyphenyl-4-chlorobenzoate and 4-chlorophenyl-2'-methoxy benzoate is 99:1. The ester is then hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis of the ester is carried out under basic<br>
 <br>
alcoholic conditions at a pH in the range of 9-14. The hydrolyzed product contains salt of p-benzoic acid. The hydrolyzed product mixture is quenched with water to remove unreacted ester if any and then neutralised to pH in the range of 8 to 6, at this pH , a biphasic system containing an organic phase and an aqueous phase is obtained. The organic phase is removed from the biphasic system and the aqueous phase is then further acidified to a pH in the range of 1-3 to crystallize out para-benzoic acid .<br>
The invention is further illustrated with the help of examples which do not limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a R.B. flask equipped with a stirrer was charged 200ml acetic acid. lOOgm H2S04 was then slowly added to it &amp; the system was heated to 40°C. 1.4mole of 65% H2O2 and 1.0 mole of 2-Methoxy-4'-ChloroBenzo phenone, were added simultaneously but separately, over a period of 3 hrs maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at 40°C. The mixture was further stirred for a period of 6.5 hrs at 40°C. The reaction was monitored by G.C. Reaction at termination showed 91.5 % of product ester 2'-methoxyphenyl-4-chlorobenzoate, 7.3 % unreacted starting raw material 2- Methoxy 4' Chloro Benzophenone &amp; 1.2 % of 4-chlorophenyl-2'-methoxy benzoate, ester impurity. Ratio of 2'-methoxyphenyl-4-chlorobenzoate and 4-chlorophenyl-2'-methoxy benzoate was found to be 99:1. Reaction mass was then quenched with water, the aqueous layer was further extracted with Ethylene dichloride. The Organic layer was further washed sequentially with sodium bisulfite and aqueous sodium carbonate till pH of<br>
 <br>
organic layer was neutral. Organic layer was distilled to remove the solvent. 252 gm of Crude ester 2'-methoxyphenyI-4-chlorobenzoate of Purity 92%, corresponding to 92.5% yield was obtained after removal of the solvent. Crude ester was then hydrolyzed by refluxing it with methanolic NaOH for 10 hrs. After complete hydrolysis, the methanol from the hydrolyzed mixture was recovered and the concentrated mass was quenched with water, the unreacted ester was removed by extracting the mixture with EDC. The aqueous layer was then acidified to pH 8 to biphasic system containing organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase is then separated and the aqueous phase is further acidified to pH 1-3 to obtain 4-chloro benzoic acid. Yield of 4-chlorobenzoic acid obtained was 88%.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a R.B. flask equipped with a stirrer was charged 200ml acetic acid. l00gm H2S04 was then slowly added to it and the reaction system was heated to 30°C. 1.4 mole of 65% H202 &amp; 1.0 mole 2-Methoxy-4'-Chloro Benzophenone, was added simultaneously but separately, over a period of 3 hrs maintaining temperature at 30°C. Reaction is maintained further for a total period of 15 hrs at 30°C. The reaction at termination showed 89.0 % Product ester, 9.5 % unreacted starting raw material &amp; 1.5 % impurity ester by glc. Ratio of 2,-methoxyphenyl-4-chlorobenzoate and 4-chIorophenyl-2'-methoxy benzoate was found to be 99:1.<br>
Reaction mass after work as carried out in example -01 to yield 89% 4-chlorobenzoic acid.<br>
