				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns an aluminium alloy for diecasting of components with high<br>
elongation in the cast state.<br>
Diecasting technology has today developed so far that it is possible to produce<br>
components with high quality standards. The quality of a diecasting however<br>
depends not only on the machine setting and the process selected but to a great<br>
extent also on the chemical composition and the structure of the aluminium alloy<br>
Oused. The latter two parameters are known to influence the castability, the feed<br>
behaviour (G. Schindelbauer, J. Czikel "Mould filling capacity and volume deficit of<br>
conventional aluminium diecasting alloys", Giessereiforschung 42, 1990, p.<br>
88/89), the mechanical properties and - particularly important in diecasting - the<br>
life of the casting tools (L.A. Norstrom, B. Klarenfjord, M. Svenson "General<br>
Aspects on Wash-out Mechanism in Aluminium Diecasting Dies" 17th<br>
International NADCA Diecasting Congress 1993, Cleveland, OH).<br>
In the past little attention has been paid to the development of aluminium alloys<br>
which are particularly suited for diecasting of high quality components.<br>
Manufacturers in the car industry are now increasingly required to produce e.g.<br>
weldable components with high ductility in the diecasting process, since<br>
diecasting is the most economic production method for high quantities.<br>
The refinement of the diecasting technology now allows the production of<br>
weldable components of high quality. This has expanded the area of application<br>
for diecastings to include chassis components.<br>
Ductility is increasingly important, in particular in components of complex design.<br>
In order to achieve the required mechanical properties, in particular a high<br>
elongation to fracture, the diecastings must usually be subjected to heat<br>
treatment. This heat treatment is necessary for forming the casting phase and<br>
hence achieving ductile fracture behaviour. Heat treatment usually means solution<br><br>
annealing at temperatures just below the solidus temperature with subsequent<br>
quenching in water or another medium to temperatures 
treated in this way now has a low elongation limit and tensile strength. In order to<br>
raise these properties to the required value, artificial ageing is then performed.<br>
This can also be process-induced e.g. by thermal shock on painting or stress-<br>
relief annealing of a complete assembly.<br>
As diecastings are cast close to the final dimensions, they usually have a complex<br>
geometry with thin walls. During the solution annealing, and in particular the<br>
quenching process, distortion must be expected which can require retouching e.g.<br>
by straightening the casting or, in the worst case, rejection. Solution annealing<br>
also entails additional costs, and the efficiency of this production method could be<br>
substantially increased if alloys were available which fulfilled the required<br>
properties without heat treatment.<br>
An AISi alloy with good mechanical values in the casting state is known from EP-<br>
A-0 687 742. Also for example EP-A-0 911 420 discloses alloys of type AIMg<br>
which in the casting state have a very high ductility, but with complex form design<br>
however tend to hot or cold cracking and are therefore unsuitable. A further<br>
disadvantage of ductile diecastings is their slow ageing in the cast state which can<br>
lead to a temporary change in mechanical properties - including a loss of<br>
elongation. This behaviour is tolerated in many applications as the property limits<br>
are not exceeded, but cannot be tolerated in some applications and can only be<br>
excluded by targeted heat treatment.<br>
The invention is based on the object of preparing an aluminium alloy which is<br>
suitable for diecasting which is easy to cast, has a high elongation in the cast<br>
state and after casting ages no further. In addition the alloy should be easily<br>
weldable and flangeable, able to be rivetted and have good corrosion resistance.<br>
According to the invention the object is achieved by an aluminium alloy with<br>
8.0 to 11.5 w.% silicon<br>
0.3 to 0.8 w.% manganese<br><br>
max 0.08 to 0.4 w.% magnesium<br>
max 0.4 w.% iron<br>
max 0.1 w.% copper<br>
max 0.1 w.% zinc<br>
max 0.15 w.% titanium<br>
0.05 to 0.5 w.% molybdenum<br>
optionally also<br>
0.05 to 0.3 w.% zirconium<br>
30 to 300 ppm strontium or 5 to 30 ppm sodium and/or 1 to 30 ppm calcium for<br>
permanent refinement<br>
gallium phosphide and/or indium phosphide in a quantity corresponding to 1 to<br>
250 ppm phosphorus for grain refinement<br>
titanium and boron added by way of an aluminium master alloy with 1 to 2 w.% Ti<br>
and 1 to 2 w.% B for grain refinement,<br>
and as the remainder aluminium and unavoidable impurities.<br>
With the alloy composition according to the invention, for diecastings in the cast<br>
state a high elongation can be achieved with good values for the yield strength<br>
and tensile strength, so that the alloy is suitable in particular for the production of<br>
safety components in car manufacture. Surprisingly, it has been found that by the<br>
addition of molybdenum the elongation can be increased substantially without<br>
losses in the other mechanical properties. The desired effect can be achieved with<br>
the addition of 0.05 to 0.5 w.% Mo, the preferred behaviour level is 0.08 to 0.25<br>
w.% Mo.<br>
With the combined addition of molybdenum and 0.05 to 0.3 w.% Zr, the elongation<br>
can be improved even further. The preferred content is 0.10 to 0.18 w.% Zr.<br>
The relatively high proportion of eutectic silicon is refined by strontium. In contrast<br>
to granular diecasting alloys with high contaminant levels, the alloy according to<br>
the invention also has advantages with regard to fatigue strength. The fracture<br><br>
toughness is higher because of the very low mixed crystals present and the<br>
refined eutectic The strontium content is preferably between 50 and 150 ppm and<br>
in general should not fall below 50 ppm otherwise the casting behaviour can<br>
deteriorate. Instead of strontium, sodium and/or calcium can be added<br>
The preferred silicon content is 8.0 to 10.0 w.% Si.<br>
By restricting the magnesium content to preferably 0.08 to 0.25 w.% Mg, the<br>
eutectic structure is not coarsened and the alloy has only a insignificant age-<br>
hardening potential which contributes to a high elongation.<br>
Due to the proportion of manganese, adhesion in the mould is avoided and good<br>
mould removal properties guaranteed. The manganese content gives the casting<br>
a high structural strength at high temperature so that on removal from the mould,<br>
very little or no distortion is expected.<br>
The iron content is restricted to preferably max 0.25 w.% Fe.<br>
With stabilisation annealing for 1 to 2 hours in a temperature range of around 280<br>
to 320°C, very high elongation values can be achieved.<br>
The alloy according to the invention is preferably produced as a horizontal<br>
diecasting pig. Thus without costly melt cleaning, a diecasting alloy with low oxide<br>
contamination can be melted: an important condition for achieving high elongation<br>
values in the diecasting.<br>
On melting, any contamination of the melt, in particular by copper or iron, must be<br>
avoided. The permanently refined AISi alloy according to the invention is<br>
preferably cleaned by flushing gas treatment with inert gases by means of<br>
impellers.<br>
Preferably, grain refinement is performed in the alloy according to the invention.<br>
For this gallium phosphide and/or indium phosphide can be added to the alloy in a<br><br>
quantity corresponding to 1 to 250 ppm, preferably 1 to 30 ppm phosphorus.<br>
Alternatively or additionally the alloy can contain titanium and boron for grain<br>
refinement, where the titanium and boron are added by way of a master alloy with<br>
1 to 2 w.% Ti and 1 to 2 w.% B, remainder aluminium. Preferably, the aluminium<br>
master alloy contains 1.3 to 1.8 w.% Ti and 1.3 to 1.8 w.% B and has a Ti/B<br>
weight ratio of around 0.8 to 1.2. The content of the master alloy in the alloy<br>
according to the invention is preferably set at 0.05 to 0.5 w.%.<br>
The aluminium alloy according to the invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
production of safety components in the diecasting process.<br><br>
