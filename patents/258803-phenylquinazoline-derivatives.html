Phenylquinazoline derivatives<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention was based on the object of finding novel compounds having<br>
valuable properties, in particular those which can be used for the prepara-<br>
tion of medicaments.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds in which the inhibition, regula-<br>
tion and/or modulation of HSP90 plays a role, furthermore to pharmaceuti-<br>
cal compositions which comprise these compounds, and to the use of the<br>
compounds for the treatment of diseases in which HSP90 plays a role.<br>
The correct folding and conformation of proteins in cells is ensured by<br>
molecular chaperones and is critical for the regulation of the equilibrium<br>
between protein synthesis and degradation. Chaperones are important for<br>
the regulation of many central functions of cells, such as, for example, cell<br>
proliferation and apoptosis (Jolly and Morimoto, 2000; Smith et al., 1998;<br>
Smith, 2001).<br>
Heat shock proteins (HSPs)<br>
The cells of a tissue react to external stress, such as, for example, heat,<br>
hypoxia, oxidative stress, or toxic substances, such as heavy metals or<br>
alcohols, with activation of a number of chaperones which are known<br>
under the term "heat shock proteins" (HSPs).<br>
The activation of HSPs protects the cell against damage initiated by such<br>
stress factors, accelerates the restoration of the physiological state and<br>
results in a stress-tolerant state of the cell.<br>
Besides this originally discovered protective mechanism promoted by<br>
HSPs against external stress, further important chaperone functions<br>
have also been described in the course of time for individual HSPs<br>
under normal stress-free conditions. Thus, various HSPs regulate, for<br><br>
-2-<br>
example, correct folding, intracellular localisation and function or regu-<br>
lated degradation of a number of biologically important proteins of cells.<br>
HSPs form a gene family with individual gene products whose cellular ex-<br>
pression, function and localisation differs in different cells. The naming and<br>
classification within the family is carried out on the basis of their molecular<br>
weight, for example HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90.<br>
Some human diseases are based on incorrect protein folding (see review,<br>
for example, Tytelletal., 2001; Smith etal., 1998). The development of<br>
therapies which engages in the mechanism of the chaperone-dependent<br>
protein folding could therefore be useful in such cases. For example, incor-<br>
rectly folded proteins result in aggregation of protein with neurodegenera-<br>
tive progression in the case of Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases or<br>
Huntington's syndrome. Incorrect protein folding may also result in loss of<br>
wild-type function, which can have the consequence of incorrectly regu-<br>
lated molecular and physiological function.<br>
HSPs are also ascribed great importance in tumour diseases. There are,<br>
for example, indications that the expression of certain HSPs correlates with<br>
the stage of progression of tumours (Martin et al., 2000; Conroy et al.,<br>
1996; Kawanishi et al., 1999; Jameel et al., 1992; Hoang et al., 2000;<br>
Lebeauetal., 1991).<br>
The fact that HSP90 plays a role in a number of central oncogenic signal-<br>
ling pathways in the cell and certain natural products having cancer-inhib-<br>
iting activity target HSP90 has led to the concept that inhibition of the func-<br>
tion of HSP90 would be sensible in the treatment of tumour diseases.<br>
An HSP90 inhibitor, 17- allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG),<br>
a derivative of geldanamycin, is currently undergoing clinical trials,<br>
HSP90<br>
HSP90 represents approximately 1-2% of the total cellular protein mass. It<br><br>
-3-<br>
is usually in the form of a dimer in the cell and is associated with a multipli-<br>
city of proteins, so-called co-chaperones (see, for example, Pratt, 1997).<br>
HSP90 is essential for the vitality of cells (Young et al., 2001) and plays a<br>
key role in the response to cellular stress by interaction with many proteins<br>
whose native folding has been modified by external stress, such as, for<br>
example, heat shock, in order to restore the original folding or to prevent<br>
aggregation of the proteins (Smith etal.,1998).<br>
There are also indications that HSP90 is of importance as buffer against<br>
the effects of mutations, presumably through correction of incorrect protein<br>
folding caused by the mutation (Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998).<br>
In addition, HSP90 also has a regulatory importance. Under physiological<br>
conditions, HSP90, together with its homologue in the endoplasmatic<br>
reticulum, GRP94, plays a role in the cell balance for ensuring the stability<br>
of the conformation and maturing of various client key proteins. These can<br>
be divided into three groups: receptors for steroid hormones, Ser/Thr or<br>
tyrosine kinases (for example ERBB2, RAF-1, CDK4 and LCK) and a col-<br>
lection of various proteins, such as, for example, mutated p53 or the cata-<br>
lytic subunit of telomerase hTERT. Each of these proteins takes on a key<br>
role in the regulation of physiological and biochemical processes of cells.<br>
The preserved HSP90 family in humans consists of four genes, cytosolic<br>
HSP90a, the inducible HSP90p isoform (Hickey et al., 1989), GRP94 in<br>
the endoplasmatic reticulum (Argon et al., 1999) and HSP75/TRAP1 in the<br>
mitochondrial matrix (Felts et al., 2000). It is assumed that all members of<br>
the family have a similar mode of action, but, depending on their localisa-<br>
tion in the cell, bind to different client proteins. For example, ERBB2 is a<br>
specific client protein of GRP94 (Argon et al., 1999), while the type 1<br>
receptor of tumour necrosis factor (TNFR1) or the retinoblastoma protein<br>
(Rb) have been found to be clients of TRAP1 (Song et al., 1995; Chen et<br>
al., 1996).<br>
HSP90 is involved in a number of complex interactions with a large num-<br>
ber of client proteins and regulatory proteins (Smith, 2001 ). Although pre-<br><br>
-4-<br>
cise molecular details have not yet been clarified, biochemical experiments<br>
and investigations with the aid of X-ray crystallography in recent years<br>
have increasingly been able to decipher details of the chaperone function<br>
of HSP90 (Prodromou et al., 1997; Stebbins et al., 1997). Accordingly,<br>
HSP90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (Prodromou et al,<br>
1997), with dimerisation being important for ATP hydrolysis. The binding of<br>
ATP results in the formation of a toroidal dimer structure, in which the two<br>
N-terminal domains come into close contact with one another and act as a<br>
switch in the conformation (Prodromou and Pearl, 2000).<br>
Known HSP90 inhibitors<br>
The first class of HSP90 inhibitors to be discovered were benzoquinone<br>
ansamycins with the compounds herbimycin A and geldanamycin. Origi-<br>
nally, the reversion of the malignant phenotype in fibroblasts which had<br>
been induced by transformation with the v-Src oncogene was detected<br>
with them (Uehara et al., 1985).<br>
Later, a strong antitumoural activity was demonstrated in vitro (Schulte et<br>
al., 1998) and in vivo in animal models (Supko et al., 1995).<br>
Immune precipitation and investigations on affinity matrices then showed<br>
that the principal mechanism of action of geldanamycin involves binding to<br>
HSP90 (Whitesell et al., 1994; Schulte and Neckers, 1998). In addition,<br>
X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that geldanamycin competes for<br>
the ATP binding site and inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP90<br>
(Prodromou et al, 1997; Panaretou et al., 1998). This prevents the forma-<br>
tion of the multimeric HSP90 complex, with its property of functioning as<br>
chaperone for client proteins. As a consequence, client proteins are<br>
degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.<br>
The geldanamycin derivative 17- allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin<br>
(17AAG) showed an unchanged property in the inhibition of HSP90, the<br>
degradation of client proteins and antitumoural activity in cell cultures and<br><br>
-5-<br>
in xenograft tumour models (Schulte et al, 1998; Kelland et al, 1999), but<br>
had significantly lower liver cytotoxicity than geldanamycin (Page et all<br>
1997).17AAG is currently undergoing phase l/ll clinical trials.<br>
Radicicol, a macrocyclic antibiotic, likewise exhibited revision of the<br>
v-Src and v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant phenotype of fibroblasts (Kwon<br>
et all 1992; Zhao et al, 1995). Radicicol degrades a large number of<br>
signal proteins as a consequence of HSP90 inhibition (Schulte et al.,<br>
1998). X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that radicicol likewise<br>
binds to the N-terminal domain of HSP90 and inhibits the intrinsic<br>
ATPase activity (Roe et al., 1998).<br>
Antibiotics of the coumarine type, as is known, bind to the ATP binding<br>
site of the HSP90 homolog DNA gyrase in bacteria. The coumarine,<br>
Novobiocin, binds to the carboxy-terminal end of HSP90, i.e. to a differ-<br>
ent site in HSP90 than the benzoquinone-ansamycins and radicicol,<br>
which bind to the N-terminal end of HSP90 (Marcu et al., 2000b).<br>
The inhibition of HSP90 by novobiocin results in degradation of a large<br>
number of HSP90-dependent signal proteins (Marcu et al., 2000a).<br>
The degradation of signal proteins, for example ERBB2, was demon-<br>
strated using PU3, an HSP90 inhibitor derived from purines. PU3 causes<br>
cell cycle arrest and differentiation in breast cancer cell lines (Chiosis et<br>
al.,2001).<br>
HSP90 as therapeutic target<br>
Due to the participation of HSP90 in the regulation of a large number of<br>
signalling pathways which have crucial importance in the phenotype of a<br>
tumour, and the discovery that certain natural products exert their biologi-<br>
cal effect through inhibition of the activity of HSP90, HSP90 is currently<br><br>
-6-<br>
being tested as a novel target for the development of a tumour therapeutic<br>
agent (Neckers et al., 1999).<br>
The principal mechanism of action of geldanamycin, 17AAG, and radicicol<br>
includes the inhibition of the binding of ATP to the ATP binding site at the<br>
N-terminal end of the protein and the resultant inhibition of the intrinsic<br>
ATPase activity of HSP90 (see, for example, Prodromou et al., 1997;<br>
Stebbins et al., 1997; Panaretou et al., 1998). Inhibition of the ATPase ac-<br>
tivity of HSP90 prevents the recruitment of co-chaperones and favours the<br>
formation of an HSP90 heterocomplex, which causes client proteins to<br>
undergo degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (see, for<br>
example, Neckers et al., 1999; Kelland et al., 1999). The treatment of<br>
tumour cells with HSP90 inhibitors results in selective degradation of im-<br>
portant proteins having fundamental importance for processes such as cell<br>
proliferation, regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. These processes<br>
are frequently deregulated in tumours (see, for example, Hostein et al.,<br>
2001).<br>
An attractive rationale for the development of an inhibitor of HSP90 is that<br>
a strong tumour-therapeutic action can be achieved by simultaneous deg-<br>
radation of a plurality of proteins which are associated with the trans-<br>
formed phenotype.<br>
In detail, the present invention relates to compounds which inhibit, regulate<br>
and/or modulate HSP90, to compositions which comprise these com-<br>
pounds, and to methods for the use thereof for the treatment of HSP90-<br>
induced diseases, such as tumour diseases, viral diseases, such as, for<br>
example, hepatitis B (Waxman, 2002); immune suppression in transplants<br>
(Bijlmakers, 2000 and Yorgin, 2000); inflammation-induced diseases<br>
(Bucci, 2000), such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, type<br>
1 diabetes, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel dis-<br>
ease; cystic fibrosis (Fuller, 2000); diseases associated with angiogenesis<br>
(Hur, 2002 and Kurebayashi, 2001 ), such as, for example, diabetic reti-<br><br>
-7-<br>
nopathy, haemangiomas, endometriosis and tumour angiogenesis; infec-<br>
tious diseases; autoimmune diseases; ischaemia; promotion of nerve re-<br>
generation (Rosen et al., WO 02/09696; Degranco et al., WO 99/51223;<br>
Gold, US 6,210,974 B1); fibrogenetic diseases, such as, for example,<br>
sclerorma, polymyositis, systemic lupus, cirrhosis of the liver, keloid forma-<br>
tion, interstitial nephritis and pulmonary fibrosis (Strehlow, WO 02/02123).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds according to the<br>
invention for the protection of normal cells against toxicity caused by<br>
chemotherapy, and to the use in diseases where incorrect protein folding<br>
or aggregation is a principal causal factor, such as, for example, scrapie,<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's or Alzheimer's (Sittler, Hum. Mol.<br>
Genet., 10, 1307, 2001; Tratzelt et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 92, 2944,<br>
1995; Winklhofer et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276, 45160, 2001). WO 01/72779<br>
describes purine compounds and the use thereof for the treatment of<br>

The compounds according to the invention and also the starting materials<br>
for their preparation are, in addition, prepared by methods known per se,<br>
as described in the literature (for example in the standard works, such as<br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic<br>
Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart), to be precise under reaction<br>
conditions which are known and suitable for the said reactions. Use may<br><br>
-33-<br>
also be made here of variants known per se which are not mentioned here<br>
in greater detail.<br>
If desired, the starting materials can also be formed in situ by not isolating<br>
them from the reaction mixture, but instead immediately converting them<br>
further into the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The starting compounds are generally known. If they are novel, however,<br>
they can be prepared by methods known per se.<br>
The reactions are carried out by methods which are known to the person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The reactions are carried out in a suitable inert solvent.<br>
Examples of suitable inert solvents are hydrocarbons, such as hexane,<br>
petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons,<br>
such as trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chlo-<br>
roform or dichloromethane; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropa-<br>
nol, n-propanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol; ethers, such as diethyl ether,<br>
diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; glycol ethers, such as<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether (diglyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone; amides, such as<br>
acetamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethylformamide (DMF); nitrites, such<br>
as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); carbon di-<br>
sulfide; carboxylic acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid; nitro com-<br>
pounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene; esters, such as ethyl ace-<br>
tate, or mixtures of the said solvents.<br>
Depending on the conditions used, the reaction times are between a few<br>
minutes and 14 days, the reaction temperature is between about -30° and<br>
140°, normally between -10° and 130°, in particular between about 30° and<br>
about 125°.<br><br>
-34-<br>
Free amino groups are acylated, for example, in a conventional manner<br>
using an acid chloride or anhydride or alkylated using an unsubstituted or<br>
substituted alkyl halide, advantageously in an inert solvent, such as di-<br>
chloromethane or THF, and/or in the presence of a base, such as triethyl-<br>
amine or pyridine, at temperatures between -60 and +30°.<br>
Pharmaceutical salts and other forms<br>
The said compounds according to the invention can be used in their final<br>
non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses<br>
the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutical accept-<br>
able salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids<br>
and bases by procedures known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt forms of the compounds of the formula I are for the most part prepared<br>
by conventional methods. If the compound of the formula I contains a car-<br>
boxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by reacting the com-<br>
pound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt.<br>
Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, including potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal<br>
alkoxides, for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide; and<br>
various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N-methyl-<br>
glutamine. The aluminium salts of the compounds of the formula I are like-<br>
wise included. In the case of certain compounds of the formula I, acid-<br>
addition salts can be formed by treating these compounds with pharma-<br>
ceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids, for example hydrogen<br>
halides, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide,<br>
other mineral acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as sulfate,<br>
nitrate or phosphate and the like, and alkyl- and monoarylsulfonates, such<br>
as ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate and benzenesulfonate, and other<br>
organic acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as acetate, trifluoro-<br>
acetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascor-<br><br>
-35-<br>
bate and the like. Accordingly, pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition<br>
salts of the compounds of the formula I include the following: acetate, adi-<br>
pate, alginate, arginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate),<br>

Furthermore, the base salts of the compounds according to the invention<br>
include aluminium, ammonium, calcium, copper, iron(lll), iron(ll), lithium,<br>
magnesium, manganese(lll), manganese(ll), potassium, sodium and zinc<br>
salts, but this is not intended to represent a restriction. Of the above-men-<br>
tioned salts, preference is given to ammonium; the alkali metal salts so-<br>
dium and potassium, and the alkaline earth metal salts calcium and mag-<br>
nesium. Salts of the compounds of the formula I which are derived from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of pri-<br>
mary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines, also including<br>
naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion ex-<br>
changer resins, for example arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine,<br>
choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine,<br>
diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylamino-<br>

-36-<br>
zine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, tri-<br>
ethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine and tris-<br>
(hydroxymethyl)methylamine (tromethamine), but this is not intended to<br>
represent a restriction.<br>
Compounds of the present invention which contain basic nitrogen-contain-<br>
ing groups can be quaternised using agents such as (C1-C4)alky! halides,<br>
for example methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl chloride, bromide and<br>
iodide; di(CrC4)alkyl sulfates, for example dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl<br>
sulfate; (Ci0-Ci8)alkyl halides, for example decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl<br>
and stearyl chloride, bromide and iodide; and aryl(CrC4)alkyl halides, for<br>
example benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Both water- and oil-solu-<br>
ble compounds according to the invention can be prepared using such<br>
salts.<br>
The above-mentioned pharmaceutical salts which are preferred include<br>
acetate, trifluoroacetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisucci-<br>
nate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, me-<br>
glumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stea-<br>
rate, sulfate, subsalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate and trometh-<br>
amine, but this is not intended to represent a restriction.<br>
The acid-addition salts of basic compounds of the formula I are prepared<br>
by bringing the free base form into contact with a sufficient amount of the<br>
desired acid, causing the formation of the salt in a conventional manner.<br>
The free base can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact<br>
with a base and isolating the free base in a conventional manner. The free<br>
base forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms<br>
thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in<br>
polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts other-<br>
wise correspond to the respective free base forms thereof.<br><br>
-37-<br>
As mentioned, the pharmaceutically acceptable base-addition salts of the<br>
compounds of the formula I are formed with metals or amines, such as<br>
alkali metals and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Preferred metals<br>
are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Preferred organic<br>
amines are N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, di-<br>
ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine and procaine.<br>
The base-addition salts of acidic compounds according to the invention are<br>
prepared by bringing the free acid form into contact with a sufficient<br>
amount of the desired base, causing the formation of the salt in a conven-<br>
tional manner. The free acid can be regenerated by bringing the salt form<br>
into contact with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional man-<br>
ner. The free acid forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding<br>
salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solu-<br>
bility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts<br>
otherwise correspond to the respective free acid forms thereof.<br>
If a compound according to the invention contains more than one group<br>
which is capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this type,<br>
the invention also encompasses multiple salts. Typical multiple salt forms<br>
include, for example, bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, di-<br>
phosphate, disodium and trihydrochloride, but this is not intended to repre-<br>
sent a restriction.<br>
With regard to that stated above, it can be seen that the expression<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" in the present connection is taken to<br>
mean an active ingredient which comprises a compound of the formula I in<br>
the form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties on the active ingredient compared with the free<br>
form of the active ingredient or any other salt form of the active ingredient<br>
used earlier. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the active in-<br>
gredient can also provide this active ingredient for the first time with a de-<br><br>
-38-<br>
sired pharmacokinetic property which it did not have earlier and can even<br>
have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active ingredi-<br>
ent with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body.<br>
Compounds of the formula I according to the invention may be chiral owing<br>
to their molecular structure and may accordingly occur in various enantio-<br>
meric forms. They can therefore exist in racemic or in optically active form.<br>
Since the pharmaceutical activity of the racemates or stereoisomers of the<br>
compounds of the formula I may differ, it may be desirable to use the en-<br>
antiomers. In these cases, the end product or even the intermediates can<br>
be separated into enantiomeric compounds by chemical or physical meas-<br>
ures known to the person skilled in the art or even employed as such in the<br>
synthesis.<br>
In the case of racemic amines, diastereomers are formed from the mixture<br>
by reaction with an optically active resolving agent. Examples of suitable<br>
resolving agents are optically active acids, such as the R and S forms of<br>
tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid,<br>
malic acid, lactic acid, suitably N-protected amino acids (for example N-<br>
benzoylproline or N-benzenesulfonylproline), or the various optically active<br>
camphorsulfonic acids. Also advantageous is chromatographic enantiomer<br>
resolution with the aid of an optically active resolving agent (for example<br>
dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine, cellulose triacetate or other derivatives of<br>
carbohydrates or chirally derivatised methacrylate polymers immobilised<br>
on silica gel). Suitable eluents for this purpose are aqueous or alcoholic<br>
solvent mixtures, such as, for example, hexane/isopropanol/ acetonitrile,<br>
for example in the ratio 82:15:3.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of the compounds and/or<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a medica-<br>
ment (pharmaceutical composition), in particular by non-chemical meth-<br>
ods. They can be converted into a suitable dosage form here together with<br><br>
-39-<br>
at least one solid, liquid and/or semi-liquid excipient or adjuvant and, if de-<br>
sired, in combination with one or more further active ingredients.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one<br>
compound of the formula I and/or pharmaceutical usable derivatives, sol-<br>
vates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and optionally excipients and/or adjuvants.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage<br>
units which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per<br>
dosage unit. Such a unit can comprise, for example, 0.1 mg to 3 g, pref-<br>
erably 1 mg to 700 mg, particularly preferably 5 mg to 100 mg, of a com-<br>
pound according to the invention, depending on the disease condition<br>
treated, the method of administration and the age, weight and condition of<br>
the patient, or pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the<br>
form of dosage units which comprise a predetermined amount of active<br>
ingredient per dosage unit. Preferred dosage unit formulations are those<br>
which comprise a daily dose or part-dose, as indicated above, or a corres-<br>
ponding fraction thereof of an active ingredient. Furthermore, pharmaceu-<br>
tical formulations of this type can be prepared using a process which is<br>
generally known in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations can be adapted for administration via any<br>
desired suitable method, for example by oral (including buccal or sublin-<br>
gual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal),<br>
vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous<br>
or intradermal) methods. Such formulations can be prepared using all<br>
processes known in the pharmaceutical art by, for example, combining the<br>
active ingredient with the excipient(s) or adjuvant(s).<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration can be admin-<br>
istered as separate units, such as, for example, capsules or tablets; pow-<br><br>
-40-<br>
ders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liq-<br>
uids; edible foams or foam foods; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-<br>
in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
Thus, for example, in the case of oral administration in the form of a tablet<br>
or capsule, the active-ingredient component can be combined with an oral,<br>
non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipient, such as, for<br>
example, ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by<br>
comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing it with a<br>
pharmaceutical excipient comminuted in a similar manner, such as, for<br>
example, an edible carbohydrate, such as, for example, starch or mannitol.<br>
A flavour, preservative, dispersant and dye may likewise be present.<br>
Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture as described above<br>
and filling shaped gelatine shells therewith. Glidants and lubricants, such<br>
as, for example, highly disperse silicic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, cal-<br>
cium stearate or polyethylene glycol in solid form, can be added to the<br>
powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrant or solubiliser,<br>
such as, for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate,<br>
may likewise be added in order to improve the availability of the medica-<br>
ment after the capsule has been taken.<br>
In addition, if desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants and disin-<br>
tegrants as well as dyes can likewise be incorporated into the mixture.<br>
Suitable binders include starch, gelatine, natural sugars, such as, for ex-<br>
ample, glucose or beta-lactose, sweeteners made from maize, natural and<br>
synthetic rubber, such as, for example, acacia, tragacanth or sodium algi-<br>
nate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. The<br>
lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium<br>
stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium<br>
chloride and the like. The disintegrants include, without being restricted<br>
thereto, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br><br>
-41 -<br>
The tablets are formulated by, for example, preparing a powder mixture,<br>
granulating or depressing the mixture, adding a lubricant and a disinteg-<br>
rant and pressing the entire mixture to give tablets. A powder mixture is<br>
prepared by mixing the compound comminuted in a suitable manner with a<br>
diluent or a base, as described above, and optionally with a binder, such<br>
as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatine or polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone, a dissolution retardant, such as, for example, paraffin, an ab-<br>
sorption accelerator, such as, for example, a quaternary salt, and/or an<br>
absorbent, such as, for example, bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate.<br>
The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting it with a binder, such as,<br>
for example, syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulose<br>
or polymer materials and pressing it through a sieve. As an alternative to<br>
granulation, the powder mixture can be run through a tableting machine,<br>
giving lumps of non-uniform shape which are broken up to form granules.<br>
The granules can be lubricated by addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt,<br>
talc or mineral oil in order to prevent sticking to the tablet casting moulds.<br>
The lubricated mixture is then pressed to give tablets. The compounds<br>
according to the invention can also be combined with a free-flowing inert<br>
excipient and then pressed directly to give tablets without carrying out the<br>
granulation or drypressing steps. A transparent or opaque protective layer<br>
consisting of a shellac sealing layer, a layer of sugar or polymer material<br>
and a gloss layer of wax may be present. Dyes can be added to these<br>
coatings in order to be able to differentiate between different dosage units.<br>
Oral liquids, such as, for example, solution, syrups and elixirs, can be pre-<br>
pared in the form of dosage units so that a given quantity comprises a pre-<br>
specified amount of the compounds. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving<br>
the compound in an aqueous solution with a suitable flavour, while elixirs<br>
are prepared using a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be for-<br>
mulated by dispersion of the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilisers<br>
and emulsifiers, such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavour additives, such as,<br><br>
-42-<br>
for example, peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin, or other<br>
artificial sweeteners and the like, can likewise be added.<br>
The dosage unit formulations for oral administration can, if desired, be en-<br>
capsulated in microcapsules. The formulation can also be prepared in<br>
such a way that the release is extended or retarded, such as, for example,<br>
by coating or embedding of particulate material in polymers, wax and the<br>
like.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and salts, solvates and physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof can also be administered in the form of lipo-<br>
some delivery systems, such as, for example, small unilamellar vesicles,<br>
large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be<br>
formed from various phospholipids, such as, for example, cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and the salts, solvates and physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof can also be delivered using monoclonal anti-<br>
bodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are cou-<br>
pled. The compounds can also be coupled to soluble polymers as targeted<br>
medicament carriers. Such polymers may encompass polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidophenol, polyhydroxy-<br>
ethylaspartamidophenol or polyethylene oxide polylysine, substituted by<br>
palmitoyl radicals. The compounds may furthermore be coupled to a class<br>
of biodegradable polymers which are suitable for achieving controlled<br>
release of a medicament, for example polylactic acid, poly-epsilon-capro-<br>
lactone, polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, poly-<br>
dihydroxypyrans, polycyanoacrylates and crosslinked or amphipathic block<br>
copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration can<br>
be administered as independent plasters for extended, close contact with<br><br>
-43-<br>
the epidermis of the recipient. Thus, for example, the active ingredient can<br>
be delivered from the plaster by iontophoresis, as described in general<br>
terms in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).<br>
Pharmaceutical compounds adapted for topical administration can be for-<br>
mulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions,<br>
pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils.<br>
For the treatment of the eye or other external tissue, for example mouth<br>
and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as topical ointment or<br>
cream. In the case of formulation to give an ointment, the active ingredient<br>
can be employed either with a paraffinic or a water-miscible cream base.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient can be formulated to give a cream with<br>
an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application to the eye in-<br>
clude eye drops, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended<br>
in a suitable carrier, in particular an aqueous solvent.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application in the mouth<br>
encompass lozenges, pastilles and mouthwashes.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration can be ad-<br>
ministered in the form of suppositories or enemas.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration in which the<br>
carrier substance is a solid comprise a coarse powder having a particle<br>
size, for example, in the range 20-500 microns, which is administered in<br>
the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation via the nasal<br>
passages from a container containing the powder held close to the nose.<br>
Suitable formulations for administration as nasal spray or nose drops with<br><br>
-44-<br>
a liquid as carrier substance encompass active-ingredient solutions in<br>
water or oil.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation en-<br>
compass finely particulate dusts or mists, which can be generated by vari-<br>
ous types of pressurised dispensers with aerosols, nebulisers or insuffla-<br>
tors.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration can be<br>
administered as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray<br>
formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions comprising antioxi-<br>
dants, buffers, bacteriostatics and solutes, by means of which the formula-<br>
tion is rendered isotonic with the blood of the recipient to be treated; and<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may comprise sus-<br>
pension media and thickeners. The formulations can be administered in<br>
single-dose or multidose containers, for example sealed ampoules and<br>
vials, and stored in freeze-dried (lyophilised) state, so that only the addition<br>
of the sterile carrier liquid, for example water for injection purposes, imme-<br>
diately before use is necessary.<br>
Injection solutions and suspensions prepared in accordance with the rec-<br>
ipe can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.<br>
It goes without saying that, in addition to the above particularly mentioned<br>
constituents, the formulations may also comprise other agents usual in the<br>
art with respect to the particular type of formulation; thus, for example,<br>
formulations which are suitable for oral administration may comprise fla-<br>
vours.<br><br>
-45-<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I depends<br>
on a number of factors, including, for example, the age and weight of the<br>
human or animal, the precise disease condition which requires treatment,<br>
and its severity, the nature of the formulation and the method of admini-<br>
stration, and is ultimately determined by the treating doctor or vet. How-<br>
ever, an effective amount of a compound according to the invention is<br>
generally in the range from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of the recipi-<br>
ent (mammal) per day and particularly typically in the range from 1 to<br>
10 mg/kg of body weight per day. Thus, the actual amount per day for an<br>
adult mammal weighing 70 kg is usually between 70 and 700 mg, where<br>
this amount can be administered as an individual dose per day or usually<br>
in a series of part-doses (such as, for example, two, three, four, five or six)<br>
per day, so that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a<br>
salt or solvate or of a physiologically functional derivative thereof can be<br>
determined as the fraction of the effective amount of the compound of the<br>
formula I perse. It can be assumed that similar doses are suitable for the<br>
treatment of other conditions mentioned above.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one<br>
compound of the formula I and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, sol-<br>
vates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and at least one further medicament active ingredient.<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably chemotherapeutic<br>
agents, in particular those which inhibit angiogenesis and thus inhibit the<br>
growth and spread of tumour cells; preference is given here to VEGF<br>
receptor inhibitors, including robozymes and antisense which are directed<br>
to VEGF receptors, and angiostatin and endostatin.<br>
Examples of antineoplastic agents which can be used in combination with<br>
the compounds according to the invention generally include alkylating<br>
agents, antimetabolites; epidophyllotoxin; an antineoplastic enzyme; a<br><br>
-46-<br>
topoisomerase inhibitor; procarbazin; mitoxantron or platinum coordination<br>
complexes.<br>
Antineoplastic agents are preferably selected from the following classes:<br>

prine, adenosine, pentostatin, erythrohydroxynonyladenine, cladribine,<br>
6-mercaptopurine, gemcitabine, cytosinarabinoside, podophyllotoxin or<br>
podophyllotoxin derivatives, such as, for example, etoposide, etoposide<br>
phosphate or teniposide, melphalan, vinblastine, vinorelbine, vincristine,<br>

CPT-11, topotecan, arabinosylcytosine, bicalutamide, flutamide, leuprolide,<br>
pyridobenzoindole derivatives, interferons and interleukins.<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably antibiotics. Preferred<br>
antibiotics are selected from the group<br>
dactinomycin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, bleo-<br>
mycin, plicamycin, mitomycin.<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably enzyme inhibitors.<br>
Preferred enzyme inhibitors are selected from the group<br>
of the histone deacetylation inhibitors (for example suberoylanilide hydrox-<br><br>
-47-<br>
amic acid [SAHA]) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (for example ZD 1839<br>
[Iressa]).<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably nuclear export in-<br>
hibitors. Nuclear export inhibitors prevent the output of biopolymers (for<br>
example RNA) from the cell nucleus. Preferred nuclear export inhibitors<br>
are selected from the group callystatin, leptomycin B, ratjadone.<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably nuclear export in-<br>
hibitors. Nuclear export inhibitors prevent the output of biopolymers (for<br>
example RNA) from the cell nucleus. Preferred nuclear export inhibitors<br>
are selected from the group callystatin, leptomycin B, ratjadone.<br>
Further medicament active ingredients are preferably immunosuppres-<br>
sants. Preferred immunosuppressants are selected from the group rapa-<br>
mycin, CCI-779 (Wyeth), RAD001 (Novartis), AP23573 (Ariad Pharmaceu-<br>
ticals).<br>
The invention also relates to a set (kit) consisting of separate packs of<br>
(a) an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or pharma-<br>
ceutically usable derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers thereof,<br>
including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and<br>
(b) an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient.<br>
The set comprises suitable containers, such as boxes, individual bottles,<br>
bags or ampoules. The set may, for example, comprise separate am-<br>
poules, each containing an effective amount of a compound of the formula<br>
I and/or pharmaceutical usable derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers<br>
thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios,<br>
and an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient in dis-<br>
solved or lyophilised form.<br><br>

Test method for the measurement of HSP90 inhibitors<br>
The binding of geldanamycin or 17- allylamino-17-demethoxygeldana-<br>
mycin (17AAG) to HSP90 and competitive inhibition thereof can be utilised<br>
in order to determine the inhibitory activity of the compounds according to<br>
the invention (Carreras et al. 2003, Chiosis et al. 2002).<br>
In the specific case, a radioligand filter binding test is used. The radio-<br>
ligand used here is tritium-labelled 17-allylaminogeldanamycin,<br>
[3H]17AAG. This filter binding test allows a targeted search for inhibitors<br>
which interfere with the ATP binding site.<br><br>

phenyl]quinazoline ("A1"):<br>
1.1	Reaction procedure analogous to Okabe, Masami; Sun, Ruen-Chu;<br>
Tetrahedron (1995), 51(7), 1861-6<br>
1 litre of glacial acetic acid and 10 litres of ice-water are added to a solu-<br>
tion of 2.0 kg of methyl 2-aminobenzoate in 15 litres of dichloromethane.<br>
1.9 kg of calcium hypochlorite are added at 10° with vigorous stirring, dur-<br>
ing which the temperature should not rise above 15°. The mixture is stirred<br>
for a further 6 hours and left to stand for 16 hours. The dichloromethane is<br>
separated off, the aqueous phase is washed with dichloromethane, and<br>
the combined organic phases are washed with a 10% Na2S03 solution<br>
(warming!). The combined dichloromethane phases are stirred with 2 kg of<br>
silica gel, 200 g of activated carbon and 2 kg of sodium sulfate. The<br>
phases are separated, the dichloromethane is removed, 10 litres of n-<br>
hexane are added, the mixture is left to stand at 0-5° for 16 hours, and the<br>
product'isseparated off, giving 1.6 kg of methyl 2-amino-5-chlorobenzoate<br>
("1").<br>
1.2	A solution of 1 kg of sodium cyanate in 10 litres of water is added<br>
dropwise with stirring and cooling to a solution of 1.6 kg of "1" in 5 litres of<br>
glacial acetic acid. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for a further<br>
16 hours. 300 g of sodium cyanate are again added, and the mixture is<br>
stirred for a further 4 hours. The precipitate is separated off, suspended in<br>
15 I of water at 60°, and 1 I of cone. NaOH is added. The mixture is stirred<br>
at 96° for 1 hour, left to stand at room temperature for 16 hours, and the<br>
precipitate is then separated off. The latter is suspended in 6 litres of hot<br>
ethanol and separated off. The product is dried at 100° for 16 hours, giving<br>
978 g of 6-chloro-2,4-dihydroxyquinazoline ("2").<br><br>

cool and filtered through kieselguhr with suction. The solvent is removed,<br>
and the residue is purified by chromatography, giving 116 mg of 2,6-di-<br>
chloro-4-(3-nitrophenyl)quinazoline ("4").<br>
1.5	A solution of 700 mg of "4" and 0.7 g of ammonia in 10 ml of THF is<br>
stirred at 80° under pressure for 21 hours. Removal of the solvent gives<br>
2-amino-6-chloro-4-(3-nitrophenyl)quinazoline ("5").<br>
1.6	800 mg of "5" are hydrogenated by standard methods in 30 ml of<br>
THF and using 800 mg of Raney nickel (water-wet). The catalyst is sepa-<br>
rated off, the solvent is removed and crystallised from 10 ml of ethanol.<br>
Drying gives 527 mg of 2-amino-6-chloro-4-(3-aminophenyl)quinazoline<br>
("6").<br>
