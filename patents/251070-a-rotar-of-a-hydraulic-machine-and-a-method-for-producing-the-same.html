				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a rotor of a hydraulic machine and a method for producing the same.<br>
The present application relates to a rotor of a hydraulic machine, preferably a Francis turbine, Francis pump-turbine or radial or diagonal pump, with a number of rotor blades which are "arranged between' an inner and an outer cover disk, the rotor blades having an inlet edge and an outlet edge.<br>
A rotor of a hydraulic machine, such as, for example, a Francis turbine, has a plurality of rotor blades, in each case two blades forming -a^-flow duct for an operating medium, for example water, through which the<br>
operating medium flaws during the	operation of the<br>
hydraulic machine and thus sets the rotor in rotation. The manufacture of such a rotor is highly complicated because of the complex geometric shapes of. the rotor blades. In order to allow the manufacture of the rotor, for example by welding,  etc., and/or a corresponding^ machining of the surfaces,  for example by grinding, polishing, etc., by means of machine tools, such as, for example, robots, etc., the rotor blades should not lie too closely to one another. Furthermore, when blade regions are closely adjacent to one another, there is always the risk that flushed material remains caught in the rotor and therefore is detrimental to operation or even makes it necessary to shut down the hydraulic machine.<br>
On the other hand, a small radius at the inner cover disk is desirable in the region of the outlet edge (=inlet edge in the case of a pump-turbine in pumping mode) of the rotor blades, since this is advantageous for operation, above all at operating points away from the design operating point. In the case of a small radius, for example, vortex formation at the outlet of the rotor would be improved substantially in the part-load ranges. A. large number of blades results in highly confined<br>
space conditions at the rotor outlet. On the other hand, a small number of blades results, at the rotor inlet, in wide spacings and high load and cavitation at the rotor inlet.<br>
In order to eliminate this fundamental contradiction, rotors have been manufactured, for example, such that every second or third blade in the entire outlet region of the rotor blades has been designed so as to be shorter than the adjacent rotor blades, what is known as the "splitter blade runner", and the rotor blades in the inlet region have generally been left the same. The advantage of this design is that more space has consequently been provided in the outlet region, thereby essentially eliminating the above disadvantages. However, in this case, the risk of cavitation increases in the region of the outer cover disk between the blade center and outlet edge, since the blade loads increase there because of the partially reduced blade lengths.<br>
US 6,135,716 again discloses a rotor of a Francis turbine, in which the cavitation behavior has been improved in that the inlet and outlet edges of the rotor blades are shaped in a special way with respect to the axis of rotation of the turbine. The lengths of all the rotor blades are in this case left the same and therefore correspond to a conventional rotor. This results, however, once more in the abovementioned disadvantages with regard to manufacture and operation away from the design operation point.<br>
An object of the present invention is, therefore, to specify a hydraulic machine rotor, in which the abovementioned disadvantages are avoided, but which nevertheless has a good cavitation behavior and does not entail any efficiency losses.<br>
This  object  is  achieved  by  means  of  the  present<br><br>
invention in that a contact point between the inner cover disk and the inlet edge and/or a contact point between the inner cover disk and the outlet edge of at least one first blade has a larger radius with respect to the axis of rotation of the hydraulic machine than the corresponding contact points of a directly adjacent second blade, the contact points between the outer cover disk and the inlet and outlet edge of the first and the second rotor blade having essentially the same radius.<br>
It is consequently possible, on the one hand, to implement very small radii in the outlet region of the rotor at the inner cover disk, without manufacturing problems or problems due to too narrow a blade arrangement being caused. On the other hand, the load in the regions of high blade load, that is to say in the contact region of the blade with the outer cover disks, is not increased or is increased only insignificantly, since the contact lengths in these regions are not varied, as compared with conventional rotors, so that there is no impairment during operation as regards cavitation.<br>
Hydraulically and in manufacturing terms, it is advantageous if the inlet and outlet edges of a first and a second rotor blade of the rotor are at least partially shaped identically, the edges preferably between the contact point and the outer cover disk and any point on the inlet or outlet edge being shaped identically.<br>
So that the hydraulic machine can be operated frictionlessly, even in part-load ranges, the ratio between the smallest radius of a contact point of the outlet edge with the inner cover disk of a blade and the radius of the contact point of the outlet edge with the outer cover disk of this blade is predetermined to<br>
be smaller than or equal to 0.4, preferably smaller than or equal to 0.2. What is achieved thereby is that the outlet vortex from the rotor is reduced and the hydraulic machine can be operated satisfactorily even in part-load ranges.<br>
The number of rotor blades of the rotor is advantageously selected so as to be divisible by two or three, in which case every second or third rotor blade has different inlet and/or outlet edges, thus affording major advantages in manufacturing terms, at least in the region of small radii, since the individual rotor blades can thereby be machined without difficulty.<br>
For hydraulic reasons, it is beneficial to arrange the contact point between the outlet edge and the inner cover disk of at least one blade in the axial direction below the center of the inlet edge of this blade and, in respect of the direction of rotation of the rotor, to arrange the contact points of the inlet and outlet edge with the outer cover disk of at least one blade in front of the corresponding contact points of the inlet and outlet edge with the inner cover disk of this blade. Additional improvements in the hydraulic behavior of the machine arise when, with respect to the axis of rotation of the rotor, the radial spacing between the contact points of the outlet edge with the outer and the inner cover disk of at least one blade is greater than the radial spacing between the contact points of the inlet edge with the outer and the inner cover disk of this blade, advantageously is greater than 10°, preferably greater than 15°. Consequently, inter alia, the cavitation behavior of the hydraulic machine can be improved even further.<br>
If part of at least one rotor blade is arranged on the hub cover and this part is removable together with the hub cover, very small radii of the contact points at<br>
the outlet edge with the inner cover disk .. can be implemented, this, in turn, having a highly advantageous effect in the part-load range of the hydraulic machine.<br>
The present invention is described, then, with reference to the following diagrammatic and unrestricted figures 1 to 3 in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows a rotor blade of a conventional rotor<br>
of a hydraulic machine,<br>
fig. 2  shows  rotor  blades  according  to  the<br>
invention of a hydraulic machine, and<br>
fig. 3 shows a view of a rotor blade according to<br>
the invention in the axial direction.<br>
A conventional rotor blade 1 of a hydraulic machine according to fig. 1, such as, for example, a turbine, pump-turbine or radial pump, is arranged between an inner 3 and an outer 2 cover disk and has an inlet 4 and an outlet 5 edge which intersect the inner 3 and the outer 2 cover disk at the four contact points A, B, C and D.<br>
Adjacent rotor blades 1 form a flow duct, through which the operating medium, for example water, can flow. For a turbine, a flow would occur from the inlet edge 4, for example from a sufficiently known spiral casing and distributor, not illustrated here, to the outlet edge 5 and, further on, to a sufficiently known suction pipe, likewise not illustrated here, which issues underwater. For a pump or pump-turbine in pumping mode, the flow direction would be reversed correspondingly, that is to say, here, from the outlet edge 5 to the inlet edge 3. By means of the flow of operating medium through the rotor, the hydraulic machine is set in rotation (in the case of a turbine) or, as a result of the rotation of the hydraulic machine, operating medium is conveyed (in the case of a pump) .  The axis of rotation of the<br>
hydraulic machine is indicated by the dashed and dotted line.<br>
The rotor blade 1 is in most cases not planar, but, instead, may basically have any desired spatial curvature, as indicated in fig. 3, in which a view of a rotor blade 1 in the axial direction of the axis of rotation is illustrated. It can be seen that the contact points C (or G) and D of the inlet edge 4 (or 4') of the inner cover disk 3 and at the outer cover disk 2 with respect to the axis of rotation of the hydraulic machine may have a circumferential spacing (pE, that is to say do not come to lie on a radial line through the axis of rotation with respect to the axial direction of the axis of rotation, but, instead, are arranged at a defined angle with respect to one another. The same may, of course, also apply to the contact points B (or F) and A of the outlet edge 5 (or 5') of the inner 3 and outer 2 cover disk, where a circumferential spacing cpA may be provided. For the cavitation behavior of the hydraulic machine, it is beneficial in this case if this circumferential spacing is (pA of the contact points B (or F) and A of the outlet edge 5 (or 5') is selected so as to be greater than the radial spacing (pE of the contact points C (or G) and D of the inlet edge 4 (or 4') . A preferred value for (pA is in this case 15° or greater.<br>
Moreover, it can be seen in fig. 3 that, as seen in the direction of rotation indicated by the arrow, the contact points D, A at the outer cover disk 2 are arranged in front of the corresponding contact points B (or F) and C (or G) of the inner cover disk.<br>
Fig. 2, then, illustrates diagrammatically a rotor according to the invention. The rotor blades 1 of this rotor are again arranged between an inner 3 and an outer 2 cover disk and again form a flow duct for the operating medium.<br>
In this rotor, however, the inlet edge 4 and the outlet edge 5 of every second or third rotor blade 1 are partially drawn outward (or drawn inward, depending on the type of view) with respect to the axis of rotation of the hydraulic machine. That is to say, as before, part   of   the   rotor   blades   1   are   delimited conventionally, as described in fig. 1, that is to say by an inlet edge 4 between the contact points C and D, an outlet edge 5 between the contact points A and B and the inner 3 and outer 2 cover disk. Every second or third rotor blade 1' deviates from this delimitation. The inlet edge 4 of two adjacent rotor blades 1, 1' runs identically from the contact point D between the inlet edge 4 and the outer cover disk as far as any point H on the inlet edge 4, and, from this point H, the inlet edge 4' is drawn outward with respect to the axis of rotation, that is to say the contact point G of the inlet edge 4' of the rotor blade 1' of the inner cover disk 3 has a larger radius than the corresponding contact point C of the-adjacent rotor blade 1. What was stated above applies similarly to the outlet edge 5. The outlet edges 5 of the directly adjacent rotor blades 1, 1' are essentially congruent between a contact point A at the outer cover disk 2 and any point E on the outlet edge 5. From this point E, the outlet edge 5' of every second or third rotor blade 1' is drawn outward (or drawn inward, depending on the type of view) , that is to say the contact point F of the outlet edge 5' of the rotor blade 1' of the inner cover disk 3 has a larger radius than the corresponding contact point B of the adjacent rotor blade 1. The delimitation of part of the rotor blades 1 thus runs between the contact points C and D, which form the inlet edge 4, and the contact points A and B, which form the outlet edge 5, as in conventional blades, and the delimitation of every second or third rotor blade 1' runs between the points D, H and G, which form the inlet edge 4', and the points A, E and F, which form<br>
the outlet edge 5'.<br>
The above description is, of course, merely by way of example. It would, of course, also be conceivable partially to draw outward only the inlet edge 4 or only the outlet edge 5 or the inlet 4 and outlet edge 5 alternately.<br>
Furthermore, the points E and H may be arranged in any desired position on the outlet 5 or inlet 4 edge, and, in particular, in a design according to the invention, these points E and H could also coincide with the contact points A and D at the outer cover disk 2.<br>
By means of these outlet edges 5, 5' alternately running in a different way, the rotor blades 1 can be brought very close to the axis of rotation of the hydraulic machine, that is to say the contact points B of the outlet edges 5 of the inner cover disk 3 can have very small diameters. In particular, a radius ratio rB/rA of the outlet edge 5 of smaller than or equal to 0.2 can be achieved, which has hitherto been difficult, if not impossible.<br>
If the outlet edge 5 is lead very close up to the axis of rotation in the region of the inner cover disk 3, problems of space and/or mounting relating to the fastening of the rotor to the shaft 7 may arise under some circumstances. In order to solve this problem, there could be provision, for example, for designing part of the rotor blades 1 or 1' as part of a sufficiently known hub cover, not illustrated here. For example, a portion which is defined by the points E, B and F could be manufactured as part of the hub cover which would then be releasable together with the hub cover, from the rotor.<br><br><br><br><br>
