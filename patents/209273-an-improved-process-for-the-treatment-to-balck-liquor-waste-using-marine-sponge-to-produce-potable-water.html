				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the treatment of black liquor waste using marine sponge to produce potable water. More particularly it relates to separation of lignin &amp; colouring matter from black liquor waste through adsorption technology. Marine sponge particularly from Phyllum Porifera class Demospongia such as Mycale mytilorum, Acctenella forminifera, Presteylessa foetida, Sygmadoin carnosa &amp; Callyspongia fibrosa can be used for the treatment of black liquor waste.<br>
Accordingly to the widely accepted concept lignin may be defined as amorphous plyphenolic material arising from an enzyme mediated dehydrogenate polymerization of three phenylpropanoid monomers, of e.g. conyferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl acohols.<br>
Lignin (from the Latin lignin, wood) is after cellulose, the principal constituent of woody Structure of higher plants in part deposited in xylem cell walls, in part located in the intercellular spaces.<br>
The sulfite waste liquors from paper mills contain upto 3 to 6% lignin, which is not easily biodegradable. This lignin may act as a source of vanillin, syringic aldehyde, can be used as extender for phenolic plastics as well as to strengthen the rubber, as oil mud additive to stabilize asphalt, as emulsions to precipitate proteins.<br>
Lignin also can be converted to pure low molecular weight chemicals; it may serve as an important feedstock for the chemical industry. At present only vanillin and dimethyl sulfide is produced commercially and economically competitive processes for conversion to phenolic and aromatic chemicalsare real possibilities.<br>
Until the past 2-3 decades or so,  large amounts of lignin were<br><br>
discarded into streams and waterways as dilute aqueous solutions which is not tolerated now and almost all waste streams containing lignin are concentrated and burned.<br>
The process of the present invention is environment friendly &amp; convert hazardous waste to a potable water and helps in preserving environment as per environmental pollution act.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines, a number of primary and secondary treatment systems to control effluents are installed, treatment comprises clarifires to remove 85-1 OOwt. % of solid such as clarifires in first treatment and lagoons aerated or otherwise, trickling filters, modified biological systems, charcoal treatment etc.<br>
to remove as 90-95% of BOD, most solid, most of the toxicity except very little color. Ultrafiltrations also has been tried and found futile to remove total dissolved solids completely.<br>
The pulp and paper industry uses large amounts of water which is recycled and reused resulting in temperature rise and dissolution of more solids in water enhancing problems e.g. corrosion, slime and other deposits. Directly or indirectly all of these viz. BOD, color and toxicity may effect aquatic life. Total dissolved solids are removed and used as energy source in fuel. Biomethanation has also been attempted. All these do not meet the standards of pollution control. Therefore it becomes very essential to remove color, total dissolved solids with negligible quantity of BOD and COD.<br>
In the prior art following methods are used for the separation of lignin from black liquor in paper industry. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief herein below:<br><br>
Purification of waste waters from installations for bleaching sulfate paper<br>
Udeleholms A.B.  Fr.  Demande 2,  202,043 03  May  1974.  Swed  Appl. 12772/72 04 Oct. CA 82: 34833 g (1975).<br>
The lignin and other organic matter are mostly precipitated from wastewater by addition of mineral acid and by filtration. The filtered wastewater is treated with feebly alkaline ion exchange resin activated with acid and then resin is eluted with alkali to remove adsorbed lignin. The elute together with solution of original precipitate in alkali are recycled to the sulfate pulp process, preferably by burning in the black liquor recovery process. In this process the ion exchange resins used are commercially available chemical components.<br>
Desulfurisation of waste gas with pulp waste liquor Suyama A; Hayashi, H (Mitsubishi Kausha Ltd. Toyo Tokushi Kogyo K. K.) Jap. Kokai 76,20,089 17 Feb. 1976. CA 85: 67527a 91976).<br>
Fiber free black liquor is used for waste gas desulfurisation and lignin in waste liquor is precipitated as lignin sulfate. The fibre is removed by boiling. Thus 1100 ppm SO2 containing diesel oil boiler flue gas was desulfurised with boiled black liquor (pH 12) to desulfurise 93%. The spent liquor was air oxidized and coagulant was added to precipitate lignin and others. Recovery of sodium hydroxide and black liquor from cellulose manufacture<br>
Torras hostench S. A. Belg. 861, 585 31 March 1977. Span Appl. 461, 364 04 Aug. 1977. CA 89: 61292 (1978).<br>
An improved process for title recovery as compared to Spanish patent<br>
No. 29, 158 Comprises carbonation of spent liquor (preconcentrated to 40% from 10-15%) from treatment of pulp by bubbling Co2 through a stream of spent liquor in a counter current system from bottom to the top of the liquor at 75-85 and 0.5kg/cm2 and treating the resulting silica -lignin precipitate with 0.03 N NaOH to redissolve the lignin for recycling to carbonated black liquor before further concentrating by evaporating.<br>
Recovery of inorganic compounds from kraft pulping black liquor Domtar Inc. Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho 58 36292 (83 36292) 03 Marc. 1985. Appl. 382387 23 July 1981. CA 99: 89814 h (1983).<br>
Sodium compound from Kraft pulping black liquors are recovered by first acidifying the cool liquor with acids containing H2SO4 to Kraft black liquor by ultracentrifugation (UC) of liquor, followed by electrodialysis (E) of UC permeate treating deionate from E with acid to precipitate lignin and electrolytic H2O splitting of resulting solution. Removal of lignin alkaline waste pulping liquors<br>
Ishikawa H.; Kade K. (Oji Paper Co. Ltd.). Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo JP 62 90398 (87 90 389) 24th April 1987 85 226 870 Oct. 1985. CA 107: 79 808 d (1987).<br>
The title removal involved colloidising the solution lignin followed by ultrafiltration. Thus beech chips were cooked at effective alkali 14% sufidity 25% liquor ratio 4 and 165. The resulting black liquor was filtered, adjusted to pH 11, 10 and9 with which CO2 and ultra filtered to give delignification 89%, 94% and 97% respectively.<br>
Manufacture of methylolated lignin from black kraft liquor residues Dilling Peter (West Vaco Corp.) US 4, 764,59716 Aug. 1988 Appl. 61 460 15 Jun 1987 CA 109: 212612 v (1988).<br>
Methylolated lignin (I) is manufactured from black Kraft liquor residues by initially oxidizing black Kraft liquor containing (I) and salt in situ methylolation of (I) with an aldehyde followed by lowering the pH of the black Kraft liquor residue to precipitate methylolated (I) and finally recovering the precipitated methylolated (I) from black liquor residue. Thus a black Kraft residue (pH 13) was oxidized with air until the Na2S content was 1% and then stirred with 31b/mole HCHO/1000 Ib I at 70 for 2h. The black liquor containing methylolated I was acidified with H2SO4 to pH4. The methylolated I was coagulated at 85, filtered, washed with water. The methylolated slurry was then treated with triethanolamine to pH7 and then sufonated with SO2 at 205F for 12h to give sulfomethylolated. I amine salt useful as dispersing for azodyes.<br>
Recovery of solids from black liquors<br>
Caperos, S.A. Span ES 2, 006, 964 16 May 1989 Appl. 8, 801,697 27 May 1988. CA 114: 26042 n (1991).<br>
Solids in black liquors are recovered, as precipitate by mixing 1 part black liquor with 0.1-1.0 parts reactive precipitating agents and separating the precipitate. The 1000cm2 black hquor E globules was mixed with 1000cm2 saturated of solution of CaCI2  in  EtOH to form precipitate which was separated with centrifuge and washed with 1:1 EtOH- water to give ppt. 134, organic components 105 lignin 53 and pentosans 8g with 85% yield.

The combination of sponge and naturally occuring calciferous material such as muscle shells, sea shells, bone mill preferably oyster shell powder found to remove organics, inorganics and the removal of the color of the black liquor from black to pale yellow, which further treated with active carbon to get almost colorless liquid. The treated effluent was found to be passing BOD, COD and all the other parameters of effluent<br>
treated water required by the environmental agencies.<br>
All the operations in this process are done at room temperature hence saves energy costs, the treated water can be recycled to the process. The resins used in the process can be generated with known methods.<br>
In hitherto known processes main drawback are as follows:<br>
The use of acidic media involves corrosive problems. The use of alkaline media causes further filtration problems due to colloidal particles and results in to incomplete removal of organic as well as inorganic matter from the effluent resulting in to colored effluent water due to organic mainly lignin and mellanoidin.<br>
The adsorbant media used is commercially available chemosorbents.<br>
There is continued interest on development of new improved processes for separation of lignin organic matters; inorganic compounds from black liquor produced in paper mill wastes. It is he known fact those lignin-containing effluents are not degradable and hence has disposal problems in the environment.<br>
