SIGNAL RECEIVER<br>
This invention relates to signal receivers, especially receivers for radio signals as are used in base transceiver stations (BTSs) and mobile phones or mobile communication systems.<br>
Figure 1  shows the architecture of a receiver suitable for receiving GMSK (Gaussian minimum shift-keyed) modulated signals.    Such signals generally comprise a tram of symbols equally spaced in time.  Before the modulation each symbol takes one of two values, conventionally denoted +1 and -1. After GMSK modulation the signals comprise of complex valued samples each having a I (in-phase) and a Q (quadrature-phase) component. These signals are received at an antenna 1 and pre-processed by a front-end section shown schematically at 2. The pre-processing involves amplification and basic filtering.  The signal is then sampled at the symbol frequency by a sampling unit 3 to form a train of complex samples denoted r. The samples are then demodulated by a demodulation unit 4 to form a tram of symbol estimates y.   The symbol estimates are passed to an equaliser 5, which forms an estimate of the received symbols and outputs them at 5 for further processing to decode the information represented by them. The sampling unit in this receiver provides only one sample per symbol. Further processing of the signal happens by considering one sample per symbol. Therefore, it may be called a "symbol-spaced" receiver<br>
During their passage from the transmitter to the receiver the symbols wiii have been subject to interference. The interference may include:<br>
-	Interference from other signals on the channel That may be spectrally neutral ("white") interference; or interference that is spectrally biased ("coloured" interference). Coloured interference often results from interference from other signals of the same communication system.<br>
-	Interference arising from the propagation of the signal in question itself. This includes inter-symbol interference: interference between nearby symbols in that<br><br>
signal due to their having travelled from the transmitter to the receiver on multiple paths of different lengths.<br>
In order to allow the signal to be recovered reliably at the receiver, the effects of interference must be taken into account To achieve this the symbol estimates y are passed to a channel estimator 7 which forms an estimate of the effects of the channel by analysing the form of a known training sequence of symbols as received.    The channel estimator forms an estimate h of the signal prior to distortion by the channel,   h and y are passed to an SNR estimator 8 which estimates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal h is also passed to an auto-correlation computation unit 9 which generates a reference signal F. F and the SNR estimate are passed to a OMSK scaling unit 10 which scales h and F by the SNR estimate and produces corresponding h' and F. h' represents a set of filter taps gauged to represent the characteristics of the channel.  Those are applied to a matched filter unit 11 of the equaliser 5 which filters the samples y in accordance with the taps h' to form Z.   Z and F are passed to an equaliser 12 which estimates the symbols that made up the received signal. One way in which that may be done is by computing based on the channel estimate h' the likely effect of the channel on ail possible sets of received symbols, and comparing those sets with the actual received signal to determine the best fit. The symbols in the best-fitting set are adopted as the estimate that is output at 6 for further processing.<br>
One approach that has been taken to improve the accuracy of decoding is to oversample the received signal. By taking samples of the received signal at a higher frequency than the symbol rate more data on the received signal is obtained, which can be used to improve the decoding process. Since the additional samples have been generated from actual sampling of the received signal they include additional data over that contained in a set of samples taken al the symbol rate, which can be used (e.g. by means of a temporal whitening technique) to help eliminate Î±-channe! and adjacent-channel interference. This type of receiver may be called a "fractionally-spaced" receiver. However, in some<br><br>
situations the receiver may not haye the capability of performing oversampiing! and so this route is net available.<br>
One example of this situation is where a radio-frequency module (RFM) of receiver has been designed in such a way that it provides only one sample per symbol to the base-band module where the rest of the signal processing takes place. Radio-frequency module is the receiver front-end component that performs amplification, front-end filtering and sampling. Usually this component comes as a hardware solution. The base-band module is where digital signal processing takes place. Usually this part is implemented partly through software and partly through hardware.<br>
In recent days the radio-frequency module of a receiver has been designed to provide more than one sample per symbol to the base-band unit At the same time, the digital signal processing functions in the base-band unit of receiver make use of this extra group of samples to enhance the performance of receiver. But such RFMs introduce additional cost to the overall receiver<br>
There are customers who do not wish to replace their ofd radio-frequency modules, but want to change their base-band units. They may not want the best but at feast improved performance from their receiver by replacing only the baseband modules. Therefore, it is desired to enhance the old symbol-spaced GMSK receiver and Integrate it into the new base-band unit so that it can cope with one sample per symbol, yet with better performance.<br>
As mentioned above, in a typical receiver the signal processing in the base-band unit is split between software and dedicated hardware elements. The software is typically executed by a DSP (digital signal processor) which can only carry out a limited number of operations in the time available between successive symbols. Therefore, it is essential to streamline the software so that it can be carried out by suitable DSPs.   The hardware may be pre-existing, or may be shared between<br><br>
different platforms, so ft is desirable if the receiver design can take advantage or standard hardware.<br>

The present invention will now be described by way of example.<br>
Figure 1 shows the architecture of a symbol-spaced receiver suitable for receiving OMSK signals.<br>
Figure 2 shows the architecture of an improved symbol-spaced receiver suitable for receiving GMSK signals.<br>
The receiver shown In figure 2 is capable of operating with greater accuracy than that of figure 1. The receiver of figure 2 samples the signal at the symbol frequency. Then an additional set of samples is generated by interpolating between the sampled symbols. The original and additional samples are subjected to temporal whitening process in order to reduce the apparent correlation between them. The correlation arises due to the signal being corrupted by the intÏ21erence coming from other signals of similar frequency band. Removing the correlation between the two group of received samples, in other way, means the removal of intÏ21erence or coloured noise from them. Then the signals are subjected to matched filtering and decimation, before being passed to an equaliser which decides on the symbols that are to be generated as output.<br>
1. Receiver front-end (Radio frequency module)<br>
The radio signal is received from the radio channel by an antenna 20. The signal is then passed to the radio-frequency module 21 for pre-processing. The preprocessing involves amplification and basic filtering, it is normally viewed as being desirable to filter the received signal relatively narrowly (e.g. normalised bandwidth of 0.7), so as to cut out adjacent channel intÏ21erence. In contrast, it has been found that a wider bandpass (e.g. normalised bandwidth of 1.0) front end provides better accuracy of symbol recovery in the architecture of figure 2.<br>
The signal is then sampled at the symbol frequency by a sampling unit 22 to form a train of original complex samples r. Assuming the signals represents a burst of<br><br>
length N symbols then the original samples will be represented as r(n) for 0<n></n>
2. Interpolation:<br>
The samples r are passed to an interpolation unit 23, which interpolates them to form a set of additional samples. Numerous interpolation methods could be used. It has been found that a simple linear interpolation process is effective, In this process the second set of samples r2(n) is formed according to:<br><br>
The set of original samples rrfn) is denoted the even set and the set of interpolated samples r2(n) is denoted the odd set.<br>
It should be noted that more than one additional sample could be formed between each pair of original samples.<br><br>
The signals y1(n) and y2(n) are passed to a channel estimation unit 25 which forms corresponding outputs hi(n) and h2(fn). Those together with the signals y1(n) and y2(n) are passed to a temporal whitening unit 26. The whitening mechanism involves generation of noise Î±-yamnce matrix, generation of a transform matrix from the noise Î±-variance matrix and apply1ng the transform matrix onto the two groups of samples and taps separately.<br>
The noise Î±-variance matrix for the demodulated signal is defined as,<br><br><br>
and where, x is the transmitted signal vector, y1 and y2 are the even and odd samples of the received signals, h1 and h2 are the corresponding channel impulse response vectors and e1 and e2 are the noise signals. !t should be noted here that in the above equation we need only the training sequence portion of the vectors x, y1 and y2 Therefore, the difference between the received training sequence and the transmitted known training sequence, conditioned by the channel taps, gives as the error or noise signals.<br>
The actual noise de-correlation or whitening process involves operating on signal and channel taps by a transform matrix T which can be obtained from the noise Î±-variance matrix A. The derivation of T from A is considered below.<br><br><br><br>
be verified that the matrix is diagonal, which means there is no Î±-reiation between even and odd group of samples after the whitening is done.<br><br>
the computation involved are given in equation (9) and (10) can be re-written as:<br><br><br><br>
Equations (12) and (13) suggest that there wilt be significant amount of computation 1n the multiplication process when the length of samples sequence, y1 and y21s large, in the case of GSM signals the length is 156. It has been<br>
identified that computation can be reduced by doing a partial whitening process which is explained below. Then during the matched filter operation the channel taps are modified in such a way that the resultant matched filter output is same as<br><br><br><br>
are partially whitened y1elds the same result as though the matched filtering is done using fully whitened samples and taps.<br>
In summary the preferred, simplified whitening ar16 matched filter operation involves;<br><br>
4. Matched filter operation on partially whitened samples and  the scaled taps.<br><br>
it should also be noted that from the noise variance matrix it is simpler to compute variances of and a2 than to compute standard deviations Ï1 a, A direct or fuli<br>
whitening process based on equation (12)-(15) requires finding square root of variances to compute the standard deviations. The square root operation is computationally very complex for a fixed point digital signal processor, as is often used in signal receivers, whereas if the preferred whitening process is used then this square root operation is not required.<br><br>
in a typical fractionally spaced receiver, signals with two samples per symbol are decimated and combined during the pre-filter operation. But the pre-filter approach requires intensive computational complexity due to matrix inversion during pre-filter taps designing. In the receiver described herein, an approach that requires less complexity yet pÏ21orms efficiently is introduced. First the individual matched filter outputs and OMSK reference values are computed, and then they are averaged to get combined matched filter output and combined OMSK reference values.<br><br>
respectively. At first the auto-correlation or ambiguity function, C1(i)1 CÂ£f) are calculated, which are later convolved with possible hard-decision inter-symbol intÏ21erence svmbol seauences as below.<br><br><br>
Since the matched fitter computation can be done inside a DSP (digital signal processor), the same process need not be done in hardware. If the approach described above is to be applied as an upgrade to a pre-existing receiver this may not be straightforward, since the matched filter 32 may be part of the hardware equaliser unit 33 and may not be capable of being be bypassed, so . the same matched filter operation would be repeated. However, even in this situation the present approach can be implemented by setting the channel taps of the matched filter so that the primary tap is 1 and the other taps are 0, in order that the filter simply passes Z through unaltered. In the example illustrated in figure 2 the filter has 5 taps and. The computed matched filter values 2 and the channel taps as (1, 0, 0, 0, 0) are passed to it so that the same matched filter values will be presented at the output of HW matched fitter. Since the MAP equaliser 31 itself needs only F and 2 and it does not need channel taps, this technique allows the<br><br>
desired output to be obtained without any modification in a hardware equaliser (if present).<br>
Tables 1 below shows the gain that can be achieved by using the receiver of figure 2 compared to a prior receivers of the type shown in figure 1 in a range of propagation environments. The data in the tabfe is derived from simulations that are carried out using fixed-point models using proper intÏ21ace scaling.<br>

interpolated to form additional samples that are then processed as described<br>
above.	<br>
