				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A CARBOXYLIC  ACLD<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid. Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid by the reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide in the presence of a palladium compound as catalyst, an organic or an inorganic halide and an organic sulphonic acid as promoter, water and a solvent under mild conditions. Background of the invention<br>
Acetic acid has been produced industrially on a large scale by methanol carbonylation by the well known Monsanto and Cativa™ processes. US Patent 3816490, European Patents EP 728726A1 and EP 752406A1 disclose the use of rhodium or iridium as catalyst to produce acetic acid using methanol and carbon monoxide in the presence of iodide promoters and water. The disadvantage of these processes is the high costs and limited availability of the catalyst. The use of nickel in the presence of iodides has been reported for the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid [US Patent 4902569 and J. Catal. (156), 290, (1995)]. However these processes use drastic conditions.<br>
Palladium and platinum catalysts carbonylation of methyl iodide to acetic acid with quaternary iodide promoter is disclosed in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 179 - 180 (1999). However the activity level is low (Turn Over Number TON = 110), and methyl iodide is used as starting material. European Patent EP 0133331 discloses the palladium catalysed carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid in the presence of metal iodide, methyl iodide and sulfolane or sulfoxide. However, in this process sulfolane or sulfoxide are essential components.<br>
As can be seen, the prior art processes suffer from several disadvantages such as the use of expensive starting materials resulting in higher cost of production; low activity; or require extreme operating conditions thereby rendering the process expensive. It is therefore important to develop a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid that overcomes the drawbacks enumerated above. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid that overcomes the twin drawbacks of low activity and drastic reaction conditions.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a carboxylic acid that operates at milder reaction conditions.<br>
It is further object of the invention  to provide a process of a carboxylic acid such as<br>
acetic acid using metal halides and organic sulphonic acid as promoters.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a<br>
carboxylic acid that is efficient and less expensive.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
These and other objevts of the invention are achieved by providing a palladium catalysed process for the carbonylation of an alcohol to the corresponding carboxylic acid in the presence of halide and organic sulphonic acid promoters, water and a solvent at milder reaction conditions.<br>

organic sulphonic acid work together for the carbonylation of methanol.
