				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of (-) 3R, 4R - trans - 2,2-dialkyl -3- substituted phenyl-4- (hydroxy substituted phenyl)- substituted chromans. The product is used as key intermediates for the preparation of tissue selective estrogens as pharmaceuticals.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 3R, 4R (-) - trans - 2,2-dialkyl -3- substituted phenyl-4-(hydroxy substituted phenyl)- substituted chromans, key intermediate for the synthesis of compounds having significant medicinal properties such as contraceptives, fertility inducers, breast cancer, osteoporosis, hyper cholesteremia, estrogen replacement therapy, anti-inflammatory ,prostatic carcinoma CNS and CVS disorders.<br>
Trans - 2,2-alkyl -3- phenyl-4-(4(2-tertiary aminoethoxy phenyl)-7-methoxy chroman shown below wherein R1 and R2 are individually H or lower alkyl ,R3 and R4 are lower alkyl or forms a nitrogen heterocycle including the nitrogen atom eg. pyrrolidine or piperidine etc. (n = 1 to 4) have been found useful as contraceptives.<br>

Resolution of free base of 1 wherein RI = 7-OMe; R2= Me; R3= Me, R4 and R5 = H and X = H, led to the 3R,4R (-) and 3S, 4S (+) enantiomers of 1, optionally converted into its salt of 1 wherein RI, R2, RS, R4 and RS are as defined above and X is an anion of an acid such as HC1, fumaric acid, tartaric acid etc.<br>

Kamboj (1986), Studies in antifertility agents 50: stereoselective binding of d- and 1-centchromans to estrogen receptor and their antifertility activity, J. Med. Chem. 29: 1801-1803. Back ground of the invention:<br>
Estrogen agonists as well as antagonists elicit biological activity through their binding to estrogen receptor. In case of a chiral ligand, a specific chirality favours receptor binding. Thus, d-estradiol shows many fold higher affinity towards estrogen receptor binding as compared to 1-estradiol. In the case of trans-3,4-diaryl chromans of structure 1, 3R, 4R- trans- chroman wherein RI= 7-OMe; R2=Me; R3=Me, R» and R5 = H shows 7 fold higher affinity for ER binding as compared to the 3R, 4R- form and also elicits similar order of anti-implantation activity (JMC.29, 1801-1803). It is also possible that the different enantiomers may show different biological activities and also<br>
pharmacokinetic  properties.     Therefore,  use  of single  enantiomeric  forms  as<br>
pharmaceutical is recommended.<br>
In order to develop enantiomers of trans-3,4-diaryl chromans Figure I substituted with various amino alkoxy side chain, which is known to play a major role in deciding their antiestrogenic activities and towards development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), it was therefore, necessary to synthesize hydroxy derivatives of (3R, 4R) and (3S, 4S) enantiomers of trans-3, 4-diaryl chromans 2 which would serve as intermediate for the preparation of aminoalkoxy side chain substituted final products.<br>
The object of the present investigation was therefore to develop a process for the preparation of trans-3R, 4R 3-aryl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)- substituted chromans 2, which would serve as the key intermediate for the preparation of 3R, 4R- trans-3,4-diaryl substituted chromans variously substituted with substituted amino alkyl groups on the 4-phenyl residue.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (-) 3R, 4R - trans - 2,2-dialkyl -3- substituted phenyl-4- (hydroxy substituted phenyl)-substituted chromans of the structure 2, where in R1 and R4 are individually hydrogen, hydroxy, halogens, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, R2, R3, are individually hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl and R5 is hydrogen, halogen, nitro, cyano, C1-6 alkyl or cyclic alkyloxy, treating 3R, 4R- trans - 2,2-dialkyl -3- substituted phenyl-4-(ω-aminoalkoxy substituted phenyl)- substituted chroman derivatives of structure 3 where in R1,R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as stated above and R6 is a methyl iodide salt of a substituted amino alkoxy group, with an inorganic base selected from NaOH, KOH, AgOH, Hg (OH) 2 and the like, isolating the hydroxide salt and reacting the isolated hydroxide salt with cyclic amines selected from 1, 4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) , DBU in a high boiling solvent such as diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol or similar solvents at a temperature in the range of 80°C to 200°C for a period of 5 minutes to 8 hrs or insitu conversion of methyliodide salt to desired compound of structure 2 using above stated methodology.<br>
