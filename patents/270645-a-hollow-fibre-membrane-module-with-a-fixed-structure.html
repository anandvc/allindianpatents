				<td>A HOLLOW FIBRE MEMBRANE MODULE<br>
WITH A FIXED STRUCTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a filtrating equipment, more specifically, to a hollow<br>
fibre membrane module with a fixed structure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hollow fibre membranes have been widely used m the fields such as water treatment,<br>
biological separation and air filtration. The typical manner for constructing a hollow fibre<br>
membrane module is to amount a bundle of hollow fibre membranes into a bearing shell, then<br>
fix the ends of the bundle. However, such manner of directly amounting the bundle into a<br>
shell easily causes the fibre membranes knotted and disordered.<br>
The directly fixed membrane module has been improved. Some improvement are to<br>
cover a net-like protection layer on the bundle, and others are to separate the membranes into<br>
several bundles with separators. Although the above improvements have a certain protection<br>
effect on the membranes, they easily damage the bundles, and cannot well solve the problems<br>
existing in the distribution of water stream and collection of the produced water, which tend<br>
to resulting the breaking of the membranes and the low filtrating efficiency. When the<br>
diameter and the length of the membrane module are larger, the above problems are more<br>
obvious.<br>
To solve the above problems, someone have proposed to add a waiter distributing device<br>
at the end of the bundle, so as to distribute water, and fix the water distributor, bundle and<br>
shell together through bonding. However, this method still has the problem of nonuniform<br>
water distribution.<br>
Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a hollow fibre membrane module with<br>
a reasonable structure, which has more reasonable and efficient water stream distribution and<br>
produced water collection, improved hollow membranes availability, and higher filtration<br>
efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

a fixing structure into the hollow fibre membrane module.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Through extensive and intensive investigation, the inventors of the present invention<br>
have found that by incorporating a fixing structure such as a separate fixed ring into the<br>
hollow fibre membrane module, a hollow fibre membrane module with a reasonable structure,<br>
which has more reasonable and efficient water stream distribution and produced water<br>
collection, improved hollow membranes availability, and higher filtration efficiency, can be<br>
obtained. Based on the above finding, the present invention has been achieved.<br>
Now, the present invention is further described in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
However, it should be understood that these drawings are merely to illustrate the present<br>
invention, not limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of the hollow fibre membrane module with a fixed structure<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Figure 1, the<br>
hollow fibre membrane module is a cylinder structure. The central tube 1 is also a cylinder,<br>
and there are small holes 11 drilled on the outer wall thereof. The separate fixed rings 2 are<br>
distributed in equidistance on the central tube 1 for separating and fixing the hollow fibre<br>
membranes 6. The radial rib plates 3 corresponding to each separate fixed ring 2 forms a<br>
plane along the axis of the central tube 1. The hollow fibre membranes 6 are also in the form<br>
of cylinder and parallel with the central tube 1, and the ends thereof and the central tube 1 are<br>
fixed together. These hollow fibre membranes 6 are arranged in parallel through the separate<br>
fixed rings 2. The above member composed of the central tube 1, the hollow fibre membranes<br>
6 and the separate fixed rings 2 are inserted into the bearing shell 7, so as to seal the outer<br>
edge of the ends of the membranes and the bearing shell 7, In another embodiment, the ends<br>
of the membranes, the central tube 1 and the bearing shell 7 can be directly integrated with a<br>
bonding material. In another embodiment, when only one separate fixed ring 2 is used, it is<br>
located at the middle of the central tube 1.<br>
The operation principle of the hollow fibre membrane module is as follows: when the<br>
ultrafiltration membrane is an internal pressure membrane, raw water flows into the inlet 8<br>
located at one end of the hollow fibre membranes 6, then the filtrated produced water flows<br>
into the central tube 1 via the through-hole on the central tube 1 through the space between<br>
the bundle, and flows out of the produced water outlets 9 on both ends of the central tube 1;<br>
and, the raw water without being filtrated flows into the other end of the membranes 6 via the<br>
inner side of the membranes, so as to form concentrated water and flow out of the<br>
concentrated water outlet 10, wherein the produced water outlet 9 can be located at one end of<br>
the central tube 1 only; and, when the ultrafiltration membrane is an external pressure<br>
membrane, the inlet 8 and the concentrated water outlet 10 become the produced water outlets,<br>
and the produced water outlet 9 becomes an aeration outlet, thus the produced water flows out<br>
of the inlet 8 and the concentrated water outlet 10 via the outer sides of the membranes.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the separate fixed ring 2 in the preferred embodiment<br><br>
according to Figure 1. As illustrated in Figure 2, the separate fixed ring 2 is composed of an<br>
outer ring 4, an inner ring 5, and radial rib plates 3 located between the outer ring and the<br>
inner ring in equidistance. There are many through-holes 12 on the outer ring 4, the inner ring<br>
5 is fixed on the central tube 1, and the radial rib plate 3 has a length of no less than 5mm, a<br>
width of no less than 2mm and a thickness of no less than 2mm, generally. When mounting,<br>
the outer ring 4 and the radial rib plates 3 can be integrated, or the outer ring can be formed<br>
into many separating bodies respectively inserted into the radial rib plates 3. The amount of<br>
the separafing bodies is at least 2, and at most equal to the amount of the radial rib plates 3.<br>
The separating bodies and the radial rib plates 3 can be bonded together, or the separating<br>
bodies and the radial rib plates 3 can be clipped together, and the separating bodies can be<br>
easily separated from the radial rib plates 3. The hollow fibre membranes are mounted in a<br>
cyclic space formed by the outer ring 4, the inner ring 5 and the radial rib plates 3 of the<br>
separate fixed ring in equal amount.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are as follows:<br>
The separate fixed ring fixes the bundle, correspondingly separates the bundle, and<br>
forms a channel between the bundle, thus greatly reducing the resistance of the membranes<br>
against water stream. Raw water flows into the inlet, then penetrates through the wall of the<br>
hollow membranes to form produced water, while raw water flows to the other end of the<br>
inner wall of the membranes to form concentrated water. Through the above channel formed<br>
by the separate fixed rings, the produced water can flow into the produced water outlet<br>
without being blocked, and the concentrated water can be discharged from the concentrated<br>
water outlet, thus greatly increasing the operating efficiency of the membranes. Therefore,<br>
when the diameter and the length of the membrane module are larger, the configuration of the<br>
present invention can still remain the ordered arrangement of the membranes and the high<br>
efficient operation, thus ensuring the collection and flow of the produced water.<br>
Although the present invention has been illustrated in detail for the purpose of clarity<br>
and understanding, upon reviewing the description of the present application, those skilled in<br>
the art will readily understand that various amendments and modifications can be made in the<br>
