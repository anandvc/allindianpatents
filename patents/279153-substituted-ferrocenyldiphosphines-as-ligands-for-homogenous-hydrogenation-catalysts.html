				<td>Substituted ferrocenyldiphosphines as ligands for homogeneous hvdrogenation catalysts<br>
The present invention relates to 2,2'-bis(a-secondary aminoalkyl)-1,1'-diphosphinoferrocenes having 3,5- or 3,4,5-substituted phenyl radicals in the phosphine groups as ligands for homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts; metal complexes of these ligands with metals of transition group 8 of the Periodic Table of the Elements; and a process for hydrogenating prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated, organic compounds.<br>
EP-A-0 967 015 describes, in quite general terms, 1,1'-diphosphinoferrocenes which are substituted in the 2,2' positions with very different, chiral α-substituted alkyl radicals. Specific mention is made of some 1,1'-diphenylphosphinoferrocenes which are substituted in the 2,2' positions by a-secondary aminophenylmethyl, for example α-dimethylaminophenylmethyl. These diphosphinoferrocenes act as ligands for effective, homogeneous and enantio-selective metal catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bonds. No mention is made of a possible influence of substitution of the phenyl radicals in the two phosphino groups.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that specific substitution of the 3, 5 and possibly 4 positions of the phenyl radicals in the two phosphino groups leads to ligands whose metal complexes display a considerably higher activity and thus also productivity to hydrogenation products and also display a very high enantioselectivity in the hydrogenation of prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated compounds, so that the hydrogenations can even be carried out at atmospheric pressure. Hydrogenation processes using such metal complexes therefore offer significant process engineering and economic advantages.<br>
The invention provides compounds of the formula I in the form of essentially pure enantiomers.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R1 is C1-C4alkyl, C6-C10aryl or C7-C11aralkyl,<br>
R2 is an open-chain or cyclic secondary amino group,<br>
and R is a radical of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R3 is C12-C4alkyl or C1-C4alkoxy, and<br>
R4 is H, C1-C4alkyl or C1-C4alkoxy.<br>
C1-C4Alkyl radicals R1 can be linear or branched and can be methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl and n-, i- or t-butyl. The alkyl is preferably linear. Preferred alkyl radicals R1 are methyl and ethyl.<br>
C6-C10Aryl radicals R1 can be, for example, phenyl or naphthyl. A preferred aryl radical R1 is phenyl.<br>
A preferred aralkyl radical R1 is benzyl.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, R1 in the compounds of the formula I is phenyl.<br>
The secondary amino group preferably contains a total of from 2 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The open-chain or cyclic secondary amino group R2 can correspond to the formula R5R6N-, where R5 and R6 are each, independently of one another, C1-C6alkyl, preferably C1-C4alkyl, C3-C8cycloalkyl, preferably C5-C6cycloalkyl, C6-C10aryl, preferably phenyl, or C7-C11aralkyl, preferably benzyl, where the cycloalkyl groups and aryl groups are unsubstituted or substituted by C1-C4alkyl or C1-C4alkoxy, or R5 and R6 together form tetramethylene, pentamethylene or 3-oxapentylene. Examples of alkyl radicals, which are preferably linear, are methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Examples of cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopentyl, cyclo-hexyl and cyclooctyl.<br>
ln a preferred embodiment, R5 and R6 are each methyl, ethyl, phenyl, benzyl, cyclohexyl, or R5 and R6 together form tetramethylene, pentamethyl.ene or 3-oxapentylene. Very particular preference is given to R5 and R6 each being methyl.<br>
Alkyl or alkoxy radicals R3 can be linear or branched and can be methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl and n-, i- or t-butyl, or methoxy, ethoxy, n- or i-propoxy and n-, i- or t-butoxy. Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl and t-butyl. Preferred alkoxy radicals are methoxy and t-butoxy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, both radicals R3 are methyl, t-butyl or methoxy.<br>
Alkyl or alkoxy radicals R4 can be linear or branched. Specific examples have been given for Rain a preferred embodiment, R4 is H or methoxy.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of the formula I are those in which R1 is phenyl, R2 is di-C1-C4alkylamino, in particular dimethylamino, R3 is methyl, t-butyl or methoxy and R4 is H, methyl or methoxy.<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 are obtainable by known methods as are described, for example, in EP-A 0 965 574 or by J. J. Almena Perea in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 10 (1999) pages 375 to 384. The compounds are obtainable, for example, by reacting compounds of the formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 have the meanings given for the compounds of the formula I and X is H, CI, Br or<br>
I, preferably H or Br,<br>
with an organometallic compound such as lithium alkyl (methyllithium or butyllithium) and<br>
subsequently adding a monohalophosphine of the formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R is as defined above and X1 is halogen, preferably CI, Br or I.<br>
The compounds of the formulae II and III are known or can be prepared by analogous methods. The reaction is generally carried out in inert solvents, for example ethers or hydrocarbons. Further details regarding this reaction may be found in the examples. The preparation of substituted halophosphines is known to those skilled in the art and can be carried out either by published preparative methods or by methods analogous to these starting from the appropriately substituted aryl bromides.<br>
The novel compounds of the formula I are ligands for complexes of metals selected from the group of TM8 metals, in particular from the group Ru, Rh and Ir, which are excellent catalysts or catalyst precursors for asymmetric syntheses, for example the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated, organic compounds. the metal complexes display a very high activity and enantioselectivity. If prochiral unsaturated organic compounds are used, a very high excess of optical isomers can be induced in the synthesis of organic compounds and a high chemical conversion can be achieved in short reaction times. The activity and enantioselectivity for selected substrates is considerably higher than that obtained using known unsubstituted diphosphines. In addition, the productivity can also be increased considerably by means of the metal complexes. In this way, efficient hydrogenation processes can be carried out even at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The invention further provides complexes of metals selected from the group of TM8 metals with compounds of the formula I as ligands.<br>
Possible metals are, for example, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Co, Rh, Pd, Ir, Ru and Pt. Preferred metals are rhodium and iridium and also ruthenium, platinum and palladium.<br>

The metal complexes of the invention are prepared by methods known from the literature (cf. US-A-5,371,256, US-A-5,446,844, US-A-5,583,241 and E. Jacobsen, A. Pfaltz, H. Yamamoto (Eds.), Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis I to III, Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1999, and references cited therein).<br>
The metal complexes of the invention are homogeneous catalysts, or catalyst precursors which can be activated under the reaction conditions, which can be used for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated, organic compounds. Such hydrogenations using soluble homogeneous metal complexes are described, for example, in Pure and Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 1, pp. 131-138 (1996). According to the invention, preference is given to using complexes of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium for the hydrogenation. Particularly good results are achieved in the hydrogenation of prochiral compounds having a carbon double bond. The high activity also enables the amount of catalyst to be reduced, which offers economic advantages.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of complexes of metals selected from the group of TM8 metals with ligands including compounds of the formula I as homogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated, organic compounds by means of hydrogen.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral, organic compounds containing at least one carbon double bond by means of hydrogen in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst, wherein the addition reaction is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of at least one complex of metals selected from the group of TM8 metals with compounds of the formula I as ligands.<br>

The process of the invention can be carried out at low or elevated temperatures, for example temperatures in the range from -20 to 150°C, preferably from -10 to 100°C, particularly preferably from 10 to 80°C. The optical yields are generally better at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or super-atmospheric pressure. The pressure can be, for example, from 104 to 2 x 107Pa (pascal), preferably from 105 to 2 x 106 Pa and particularly preferably in the range from atmospheric pressure to 106Pa<br>
Catalysts are preferably used in amounts of from 0.00001 to 10 mol%, particularly preferably from 0.0001 to 10 mol%, and in particular from 0.001 to 5 mol%, based on the compound to be hydrogenated. The molar ratio of compound to be hydrogenated to homogeneous catalyst can be, for example, from 10 to 10 000 000 and more preferably from 20 to 100 000.<br>
The preparation of the catalysts and hydrogenations and addition reactions can be carried out in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, with it being possible to use one solvent or mixtures of solvents. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, heptane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, dichloroethane and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrfle), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-substituted lactams (N-methylpyrrolidone), carboxamides (dimethyl-acetamide, dimethylformamide), acyclic ureas (dimethyiimidazoline) and sulphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether), nitromethane and water.<br>
The reactions can be carried out in the presence of cocatalysts, for example quaternary ammonium halides (tetrabutylammonium iodide) and/or in the presence of protic acids, for example mineral acids (cf., for example, US-A-5,371,256, US-A-5,446,844 and US-A-5,583,241 and EP-A-0 691 949). The cocatalysts are particularly useful for hydrogenations.<br>
The metal complexes used as catalysts can be added as separately prepared, isolated compounds or can be formed in situ prior to the reaction and then mixed with the substrate to be hydrogenated. It can be advantageous to additionally add ligands in the reaction using isolated metal complexes, or to use an excess of the ligands in the in-situ preparation. The excess can be, for example, from 1 to 30 mol%, preferably from 1 to 10 mol%, based on the metal compound used for the preparation. In the in-situ preparation of the catalysts, it is also possible to use salts of the diphosphine ligands, for example halides or tetrafluoroborates.<br>
The process of the invention is generally carried out by initially placing the catalyst in the reaction vessel and then adding the substrate or vice versa, if appropriate reaction auxiliaries and then hydrogen, and then starting the reaction. The hydrogen is preferably introduced under pressure. The process can be carried out continuously or batchwise in various types of reactor.<br>
'The chiral organic compounds which can be prepared according to the invention are active substances or intermediates for the preparation of such substances, in particular in the field of preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>

t-ButylLi (4.42 ml, 6.63 mmol, 3.0 equivalents; 1.5 M in pentane) is added dropwise at 0°C under argon to a solution of (R,R)-1,1-bis(α-N,N-dimethylaminophenylmethyl)ferrocene (1.00 g, 2.21 mmol) in dry tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) (20 ml) over a period of 5 minutes. The solution obtained is stirred for 1 hour at 0oC. Chlorobis(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxyphenyl)-phosphine (2.61 g, 7.74 mmol, 3.5 equivalents) is subsequently added over a period of 5 minutes and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is poured into saturated NaHCO3 solution (100 ml), the organic phase is separated off and the aqueous phase is extracted with TBME (3 x 100 ml). The combined organic phases are washed with saturated NaCI solution (100 ml), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is dissolved in CH2CI2 and purified by column chromatography (250 g of silica gel, n-heptane/TBME 2:1); Rt (n-heptane/TBME 2:1): 0.11). The resulting yellow solid (1.10 g) is suspended in methanol (5 ml) and refluxed for 15 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension is filtered and the solid obtained in this way is dried. The title compound (0.73 g, 0.69 mmol, 31% of theory) is obtained in the form of a yellow solid. 31P-NMR (C6D6): -22.7 ppm (s); optical rotation [a]D20: -61.5 (C=1.0, CHCI3).<br>
Example A2: Preparation of (αR, αR)-2,2,-bis(α-N,N-dimethylaminophenylmethyl)-(S,S)-1,1'-<br>
bis[di(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphino]ferrocene<br>
20 g  (44.2 mmol)  of (R,R)-1,1'-bis(α-N,N-dimethylaminophenylmethyl)ferrocene together<br>
with 160 ml of TBME are placed in a reaction vessel at 0°C under argon. 88.4 ml of t-butylLi<br>
(1.5 M in pentane, 132.6 mmol) are then added dropwise at 0 - 3oC over a period of<br>
40 minutes. The reaction solution is stirred for another 2 hours at 0°C. 42.82 g (154.7 mmol)<br>
of bis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)chlorophosphine suspended in 100 ml of TBME are subsequently<br>
added dropwise at 3 - 7°C. The reaction solution is firstly stirred for 2 hours at 0°C and then<br>
overnight at room temperature.<br>
The solution is then hydrolyzed at 0°C by means of 250 ml of saturated, aqueous sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate solution and the mixture is extracted with TBME. The organic phases<br>
are washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, combined, dried over sodium sulphate,<br>
filtered and then evaporated to dryness.<br>
This gives 62 g of crude product. Chromatography two times over silica gel 60 using<br>
hexane/ethyl acetate 19:1 (then changed to hexane/ethyl acetate 9:1) gives 12.9 g<br>
(44.2 mmol; 31%) of the title compound. Recrystallization from diethyl ether/pentane gives<br>
6.56 g  (7.03 mmol;   15.9%) of analytically pure (αR, αR)-2,2'-bis(α-N,N-dime(hylamino-<br>
phenylmethyl)-(S,S)-1,1'-bis[di(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphino]ferrocene.<br>

After addition of 5 ml of degassed methanol, the solution is stirred for 15 minutes. 2.77 g (0.01265 mol) of cis-methyl acetamidocinnamate and 5 ml of degassed methanol are subsequently introduced into a 10 ml Schlenk flask in which an argon atmosphere prevails and stirred for 15 minutes. The ratio of substrate/catalyst is 1000. The catalyst solution and the substrate solution are injected in succession by means of a steel capillary into a 100 ml glass reactor filled with argon. Finally, 1.05 bar of hydrogen are introduced in 4 flushing cycles (argon/hydrogen). The glass reactor is heated to 25°C and the hydrogenation is started by switching on the stirrer. The course of the reaction can be followed via the hydrogen consumption (pressure drop in the hydrogen reservoir).
