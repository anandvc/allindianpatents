DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring particularly to the, drawings, thtre is show<br>
in Figure 1 a chair 10, The dudr 10 has a seat 12 and a-back 14,<br>
A left side 16 and a fight side 18 are located on opposite sides of the seat 12 and the back 14 and connect together sett frame 20 and'back frame 22, It can be seen by observing Figure 1 that the back 14 is located substantially perpendicular to the seat 12, Although a chair 10 is shown in figure 1, it is to be understood that the subject raatter of this indention could be incorporated ia other types of husan support structures, such as recliners, ottomans, sofas, chaise lounges, hamtocks and amy otter type of structure that if designed for stating or reclining of a huasn. Typically, the structure of the present invention will be particularly useful in the construction of outdoor furniture, home furniture and office 'furniture, the seat frame' 20 coaititutes a rigid structure surrounding an enclosed space 24, k similar enclosed space 34 is formed by the back frame 22. Included within each enclosed space 24 is the tenia body support structure 26 of this invention,<br>
Mounted between the meiibsrs of the seat frame 20 or the back frame 22 are a series of first cords 28, The first cords 28 are to be slightly stretchable, stall in diameter, maybe no more<br>
than an eighth of an inch in diameter, and resemble a string. Bach of the cords 28 is mounted in a taut relationship on' their respective seat frame 20 or back frame 22, laoh of the first cords 28 are located evenly spaced apart. He number of the first cords 28 eta he increased or decreased according to what it desired, It happens to be that the nyaber -selected is twelve in nipber. Each first cord 2S passes through a hole formed in a pin 30. there are actually twelve in number of the pins 30 mounted on the each first cord 21, and since there are eighteen in nutBber of the first cords 28 located between the sides- 16 and 18, that means there will be a total number of two-hundred and sixteen pins 30. There will be two-hundred and sixteen of the pins 30 located in both the seat 12 and the back 14, However, in a recliner, sofa, hasaock or chaise loungi, it is understood that there will almost assuredly be a greater maaber of pins 30.<br>
Between the sides 16 and 18, there are mounted a plurality of second cords 32. The second cords 32 are all identical and again the same as the first cords 28, She second cords 32 are located in a perpendicularly oriented relationship relative to the first cords 28. The second cords 32 also pass through a series of the pins 30 with it being understood that each cord 32 will pass through eighteen in number of the pins 30 while each cord 28 only passes through twelve in number of the pins 30 within the embodiment of the invention showa in figure 1,<br>
There are also eighteen in number of third cords 34. The third corf® 34 are located parallel to the first cords 28,<br>
each third corf 34 is speed about am and one-quartsr inch from the first cord 28. lack third corf 34 also passes through a hole in each of the pins 30 with it being understood that each third cord 34 will be conducted through twelve is number of the pins 30.<br>
Also mounted through a tola in etch, of the piss 30 is a fourth cord M with tha fourth cords 36 also being identical in construction to the first cords 28» The fourth cords 3€ are located paraxial to each other and are located parallel to the second cords 32 and are spaced about one and one-guarter inch from each second cord 32. Each of the fourth cords 36 will also toe conducted through eighteen in number of the pins 30,<br>
Bach of the pins 30 hai a rounded upper end 38, When there is no human resting against the structure %€, the pins 30 are ia the position shorn in Figure 2 with the rounded upper end 38 all being located on a plane 40, However, when the human places his or her body against the rounded upper ends 38, the entire series of pias 30 will deflect, as shorn in Figure 3, trita the human body being defined as lice 42. The deflection of the pias 30 will be permitted by the stretching of the cords 28, 32* 34 and 3f. She spicing between ths pins 30 is aaiatained essentially constant by the using of spacers 44, Sach spacer 44 constitute® -a sleeve with each of the cords 28, 32, 34 and 36 being conducted through a series of the spacers 44 with there being a spacer 44 between each directly adjacent pair of pins 30, The function of the spacers 44 is to keep the pins 30 spaced about three-eighths of an inch to one-half of aa inch apart.  The<br>
spacers 44 are shown to be a separate part froa the pin? 30, However, it ia considered to be within the scops of tMi invention that the spacers 44 could actually be incorporated to be part of the pins 30.<br>
It is to fee understood that when tie weight of the human body is placed against the rounded upper ends 38 of the pias 30, as is shown, ia figure 3, the pine 30 do not deflect, laoh pin 30 regains the same size, fhe pias 30 deflect withis the structure 26 which is permitted by the streteeMiiess of the cords 28, 32, 34, and 36.<br>
It is to be acted that then the weight of the human body is placed against the rounded upper ends 38, as is shown in Figure 3, the pins 30 will actually pivot so that tba leagitadiital center axil 46 of each pia 30 will be located substantiaily peirpendicwlar to the body surface represented by line 42. this perpendicular aixangement is desired as this is most comfortable to the user.. Also, it is therapeutic ia that the pins 30 reaction to apply acoupresaure to the usar which nay help to relieve eoraaess ia muscles.<br>
Because each pia 30 ia supported on four different cords, 28, 32, 34 and 36, each of the pias 30 irtll function to twist as weight is applied to the plane. 40 so as to Maintain a petpeiidicular relationship with respect to the surface 42, Without the use of the torn different cords, this twisting of each of the pins 30 would be difficult to accomplish, The length of each of the spacers 44 is deemed to be a nutter of choice.<br>
However, in mat instances the spacers 44 will be between, one-fourth and one-half inch in length.<br>
Referring particularly to Figures 5 and 5, there is shorn a modified form of constructional arrangement tetwesa the pins 48 and the spacers 50, lack pin 48 has a plurality of bosses'<br>
S2 which protrude from the sidewall of its respective pia 48. ' Each bogs 52 is located at a hole 54 that is forced within the pin 48. It is to be understood that each pia 48 will have tight ia number of the basses 52, Each spacer 50 has a through hole 56. it the end of each spacer 50 forms an annular chamfered edge 58, Each chamfered edge 58 is to matingly engage with an annular inclined surface 60 formed interiorly of each boss 52, fhe stractural arraagement between the pias and spacers ia figures 5-8 versus Figures 1-4 is that the pins 48 and spacers 50 are interconnected by the chamfered edges S8 and their respective-annular inclined surfaces 60, wherein Fgures 1-4 there is no -such connection but just an abutting relationship. In Figures 5-6, there still is used the first cords 28, second cords 32, third cords 34 and fourth cords 36 ia the same arrangement as was previously discussed ia figures 1-4,<br>
Each of the pias 48 has a smoothly contoured tip 62 which is a little bit more flat than in figures 1-4, fhe tips 62 provide a slightly greater flat surface area of contact than the rounded upper ends 38 which aay prove to be more comfortable to a user.<br><br><br><br>
