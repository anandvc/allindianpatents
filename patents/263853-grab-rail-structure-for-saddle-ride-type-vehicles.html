[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of Che Invention] GRAB RAIL STRUCTURE FOR SADDLE-RIDE TYPE VEHICLES<br>
[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to improvement of a grab rail structure for saddle-ride type vehicles. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As knovm grab rail structures for saddle-ride type vehicles, there are a metallic one fitted to the rear part of the body (e.g. see Patent Document 1) and what includes a soft layer formed outside the mandrel as an assist grip for vehicles (e.g. see Patent Document 2).<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2006-143058 [Patent Document 2] JP-B No. H6-6415 [0003]<br>
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of Patent Document 1 will be described. A grab rail 31 is a metallic component formed in a U shape in a plan view, open toward the front part of the vehicle and having grips concavely shaped in the under faces left and right, the inner parts of these grips in the direction of the vehicle width being fitted to a body frame 13.' [0004]<br>
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of Patent Document 2 will be described. An assist grip is formed by encircling a belt-shaped mandrel 1 having fitting parts 2 and 2 at its two ends with a synthetic resin-made core 4 except around the fitting parts 2 and<br><br>
2, further wrapping this synthetic resin-made core 4 with a sponge layer 7, and covering this sponge layer 7 with a synthetic resin sheet 8.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0005]<br>
The grab rail 31 of Patent Document 1, though the under faces of the grips are concaved and easy to grasp, is inferior in grabbing comfort because its material is hard.<br>
The assist grip of Patent Document 2, since it is a mere grip and therefore is applicable to a simple-shaped object, is difficult for use on a grab rail having many variations in shape. Furthermore, though soft to grasp, it is less strong and rigid because its core 1 is planar and may resonate with the vibration of the body.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a grab rail structure for saddle-ride type vehicles that is soft, easy to grasp and can ensure strength and rigidity. [Means for Solving the Invention] [0006]<br>
The invention in its first aspect is characteristic in that, in a saddle-ride type vehicle fitted in the rear part of the body-frame thereof with a grab rail for an occupant to grasp, the grab rail is formed of a core having a metallic rod-shaped core and a metallic first planar core that is joined to the outside of this rod-shaped core, comes down increasingly outside the flanks of the body and is given a plate thickness thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core and a rubber or resin-made covering<br><br>
that covers this core. [0007]<br>
In terras of the effect, as the core of the grab rail is formed of a metallic rod-shaped core and a metallic first rod-shaped core, the rod-shaped cores can easily follow even a complex grab rail whose shape varies, with the result that the grab rail can be increased in strength and rigidity and made more difficult to resonate. [00081<br>
Also, as the core of the grab rail is covered by a rubber or resin-made covering, the feel of the grab rail is soft when it is grasped and, moreover, as the first planar core of the grab rail is joined to the outside of the rod-shaped core and comes down increasingly outside the flanks of the body and is given a plate thickness thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core, the grab rail is comfortable to grasp. Furthermore, as the covering is made of a resin, its shape can be easily set, making it possible to form the surface of the grab rail of a curve and thereby to improve the external looks. [0009]<br>
The invention in its second aspect is characteristic in that a metallic second planar core thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core is joined to the rod-shaped core on the inside face thereof in the direction of the vehicle width.<br>
In terms of the effect, the metallic second planar core is joined to the rod-shaped core to increase the strength and rigidity of the core and to enhance the vibration suppressing effect, too.<br><br>
LUOIOJ<br>
Also, when the pillion passenger grasps the rear end of the grab rail, the whole palms are placed over the second planar core, and therefore the grasping ease is further increased.<br>
Further, a flat surface available for use is formed in the middle of the grab rail in the widthwise direction of the vehicle by  the second planar core joined to the rod-shaped core on the inside face thereof in the direction of the vehicle width. [0011]<br>
The invention in its third aspect is characteristic in that a part of the second planar core is lightened in weight.<br>
In terms of the effect, the grab rail is reduced in weight and the resonance of the grab rail attributable to body vibration is made more difficult to occur by the partial lightening of the second planar core. [0012]<br>
The invention in its fourth aspect is characteristic in that the rod-shaped core is formed in a convex shape having a higher central part in a side view and the first planar core is disposed underneath the convex in a side view.<br>
In terms of the effect, the first planar core is caused to support the rod-shaped core to enable the external shape of the rod-shaped core to be made smaller. [Effects of the Invention] [0013]<br>
According to the invention in its first aspect, as the grab rail is formed of a core having a metallic rod-shaped core and a metallic first planar core that is joined to the outside of this<br><br>
rod-shaped core, comes down increasingly outside the flanks of the body and is given a plate thickness thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core and a rubber or resin-made covering that covers this core, the grab rail can be made soft in feel when it is grasped and comfortable to grasp and, moreover, as the metallic core can secure the strength and rigidity of the grab rail, the grab rail can lae made more difficult to resonate. [0014]<br>
According to the invention in its second aspect, as a metallic second planar core thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core is joined to the rod-shaped core on the inside face thereof in the direction of the vehicle width, the strength and rigidity of the core of the grab rail can be further increased and resonance made more difficult to occur. Also, the upper part of the second planar metallic core of the grab rail can be used as a load space thereby to make the motorcycle more convenient to use. [0015]<br>
According to the invention in its third aspect, the grab rail can be reduced in weight and more difficult to resonate with body vibration by the partial lightening of the second planar core. [0016]<br>
According to the invention in its fourth aspect, as the rod-shaped core is formed in a convex shape having a higher central part in a side view and the first planar core is disposed underneath the convex in a side view, the first planar core is enabled to support the rod-shaped core and the external shape of<br><br>
the rod-shaped core can be made smaller, making it possible to reduce the weight and cost. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0017]<br>

[0024]<br>
The grab rail 68, which is a component arranged above the tail lamp 77 and covering the tail lamp 77 from above, is provided with crests 68a and 68b arranged left and right in a truncated chevron shape that is wide open toward the front, and a trough 68c formed between these crests 68a and 68b lower than the crests 68a and 68b and in a flat shape; the pillion passenger's hands hold side edges 68d and 68e of the crests 68a and 68b, respectively, and a flat part 68c is used as a load space. [0025]<br><br>
As side edges 72a and 73a of the body side covers 72 and 73 are disposed to be continuous from left and right side edges 27a and 27b of the front part of the seat 27 and side edges 68d and 68e of the grab rail 68 are disposed to be continuous to extensions of the side edges 72a and 73a of the body side covers 72 and 73, Che contour of the rear part of the saddle-ride type vehicle 10 (see Fig. 1) in a plan view is formed in a smooth streamline from the front end of the seat 27 to the rear end of the grab rail 68, embodying an intention to improve the external looks and reduce the air resistance. [0026]<br>
Fig. 3 shows a profile of the grab rail according to the invention; the grab rail G8, which is a member in which a rod-shaped core 105 is embedded, is provided at its bottom with fitting faces 68f and 68f (only the forward side reference numeral 68f is shown) to be fitted to the seat rails 25 and 26 (see Fig. 1) side. [0027]<br>
Fig. 4 shows a plan of the grab rail according to the invention; the grab rail 68 has a core 110 which includes the metallic rod-shaped core 105 of a shape close to V in a plan view, a pair of left and right external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 fitted by welding to the outside of this rod-shaped core 105 and an internal planar metallic core 108 fitted by welding to the inside of the rod-shaped core 105, a pair of left and right fitting members 111 and 112 fitted into positions close to the two ends of the rod-shaped core 105 for fitting to the seat rails 25 and 26 (see Fig. 1) side, and a rubber or soft resin-made<br><br>
covering 113 so formed as to cover these core 110 and fitting members 111 and 112. [0028]<br>
The external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 are members constituting the cores of the parts which the pillion passenger grabs by hand together with the rod-shaped core 105, each shaped in a substantial triangle one of whose sides is fitted to the rod-shaped core 105 to increase the rigidity of the rod-shaped core 105. [0029]<br>
The internal planar metallic core 108 is a member in which a plurality of lightening holes 108a, 108b, 108c, 108d, 108e and 108f are formed to increase the rigidity of the rod-shaped core 105 and reduced in its own weight. Further, formation of the lightening holes 108a, 108b, 108c, I08d, 108e and 108f enables the resonance frequency of the internal planar metallic core 108 to be shifted toward the higher side, to move the resonance frequency of the internal planar metallic core 108 away from the frequency of body vibration and to make the internal planar metallic core 108 more difficult to resonate.<br>
Bolt insertion holes Ilia, Ilia, 112a and 112a for fitting the members to the seat rails 25 and 26 side are bored in the fitting members 111 and 112. [0030]<br>
Fig. 5 shows a section along line 5-5 in Fig. 4; the crests 68a and 68b of the grab rail 68 are parts underneath whose surfaces concaves 68h and 68j are formed and in which the rod-shaped core 105 and the external planar metallic cores 106 and<br><br>
107 are embedded; grab parts 68L and 68R are formed to cause the covering 113 to come down outward in the widthwise direction of the vehicle along with the downward extension of the external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 from the rod-shaped core 105 outward in the widthwise direction of the vehicle. [0031]<br>
The formation of the grab parts 68L and 68R in this way to come down outward in the widthwise direction of the vehicle facilitates grasping of the grab parts SSL and 68R; further the grab parts 68L and S8R are made in a thickness facilitating their grasping, and moreover the rubber or soft resin-made covering 113 enables them to be softly grasped. [0032]<br>
As the grab rail 68 is formed, in the saddle-ride type vehicle 10 to which the grab rail 68 for an occupant to grasp is fitted in the rear part of the body frame 11, of the core 110 as a metallic first planar core which includes the metallic rod-shaped core 105 and the external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 as metallic first planar cores joined to the outside of this rod-shaped core 105 in the widthwise direction of the vehicle, comes down increasingly outside the flanks of the body and is given a plate thickness thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core 105 and of the rubber or resin-made covering 113 covering this core 110 as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 above, the feel of the grab rail 6 8 is soft when it is grasped, the grab rail 68 can be made comfortable to grasp and moreover, as the strength and rigidity of the grab rail 68 can be secured by the metallic rod-shaped core 110, the grab rail 68 can be made<br><br>
more difficult to resonate. [0033]<br>
Furthermore, since the internal planar metallic core 108 as a metallic second planar core thinner than the external shape of the rod-shaped core 105 is joined to the inside of the rod-shaped core 105 in the widthwise direction of the vehicle, the core 110 of the grab rail 68 can be further increased in strength and rigidity and made more difficult to resonate.  In addition, ths upper part of the internal planar metallic core 108 of the grab rail 68 can be used as a load space thereby to make the motorcycle 10 more convenient to use. [0034]<br>
Moreover, as part of the internal planar metallic core 108 is lightened, the grab rail 68 can be reduced in weight by the lightening, and the grab rail 58 can be made more difficult to resonate with the vibration of the body. [0035]<br>
Also, as the rod-shaped core 105 is formed in a convex shape having a higher central part in a side view and the external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 (for reference numeral 107, see Fig. 4) are disposed underneath the convex as shown in Fig. 3, the external planar metallic cores 106 and 107 are enabled to support the rod-shaped core 105 and the external shape of the rod-shaped core 105 to be reduced, making it possible to reduce the weight and cost. [0036]<br>
To add, though the external planar metallic cores lOS and 107 and the internal planar metallic core 108 are fitted to the<br><br>
rod-shaped core 105 in this mode for carrying out the invention as shown in Fig. 4, the arrangement is not limited to this, but the external planar inetallic cores 106 and 107 and the internal planar metallic core 108 can as well be integrally molded, and the rod-shaped core 105 can be fitted to this integrally molded product.<br>
[Industrial Applicability] [0037]<br>
