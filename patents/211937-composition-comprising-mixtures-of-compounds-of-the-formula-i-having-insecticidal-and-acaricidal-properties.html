COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"COMPOSITION, COMPRISING MIXTURES OF COMPOUNDS<br>
OF THE FORMULA (I) HAVING INSECTICIDAL AND<br>
ACARICIDAL PROPERTIES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising known cyclic ketoenols on the one hand and other known insecticidally active compounds on the other hand, which combinations are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects and undesired acarids.<br>
It is already known that certain cyclic ketoenols have herbicidal, insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The activity of these substances is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Bicyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) with herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are known.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and lH-arylpyrrolidine-dione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997, WO 95/26 954, WO 95/20 572, EP-A-0 668 267, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 97/ 43 275, WO 98/05 638, WO 98/06 721, WO 98/25 928, WO 99/16 748, WO 99/24 437, WO 99/43 649, WO 99/48 869 and WO 99/55 673).<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93/22 297, WO 93/10 083, DE-A-2 641 343, EP-A-347 488, EP-A-210 487, US 3,364,177 and EP-A-234 045). However, the activity of these substances is not always satisfactory.<br>

have very good insecticidal and acaricidal properties.<br>
Surprisingly,  the  insecticidal  and  acaricidal  activity  of the  active  compound<br>
	combinations according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the<br>
activities of the individual active compounds. Thus, an unforeseeable real synergistic effect is present, and not just an addition of activities.<br>

The active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br><br><br><br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-24-<br><br><br><br><br>
optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as cosolvents. The following are essentially suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br><br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
	polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and<br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-25-<br>
synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants such alizarin colorants, azo colorants and metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
	compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
 The active compound combinations according to the invention can be present in their<br>
commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides,<br>
attractants,  sterilants,  bactericides,  acaricides,  nematicides,  fungicides,  growth-<br>
regulating substances or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphates, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia.<br>
Mixtures with other known active compounds such as herbicides or with fertilizers and growth regulators are also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compound combinations according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available   formulations   can   vary  within   wide   limits.   The   active   compound<br><br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-26-<br>
concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and stored-product pests, the active compound combinations are distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
	The active compound combinations according to the invention are not only active<br>
against plant pests, hygiene pests and stored-product pests, but also, in the veterinary medicine sector, against animal parasites (ectoparasites) such as hard ticks, soft ticks, mange mites, harvest mites, flies (stinging and licking), parasitizing fly larvae, lice, head lice, bird lice and fleas.

	turkeys, ducks, geese, honey-bees, other domestic animals such as, for example,<br>
dogs, cats, caged birds, aquarium fish and so-called experimental animals such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reductions in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like) should be diminished, so that more economical and simpler animal<br>
	husbandry is possible by the use of the active compound combinations according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are used in the<br>
	veterinary sector in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for<br>

The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for protecting wood and timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the species and the abundance of the insects and on the medium. The optimal quantity to be employed can be determined in each case by test series upon application. In general, however, it will suffice to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics with a boiling range of 160 to 280°C, oil of terpentine, and the like are advantageously used.<br>

The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation<br>
number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the<br>
proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a<br>
flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the mixture is soluble or<br>
emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic<br>
organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are<br>
preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like.<br>
 Organochemical binders used for the purposes of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or   binding drying oils which are known per se and which can be<br>
	diluted in water and/or dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in the organochemical<br>
solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate<br>
resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation<br>
or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol<br>
	resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying<br>
	vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural<br>
and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin employed as binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion,<br>
dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances may also be used as<br>
binders, in amounts of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water<br>
repellants, odour-masking agents, and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like, all of which are known per se, can be employed.<br>
   In accordance with the invention, the composition or the concentrate preferably<br>
   comprises, as organochemical binders, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
   resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins which are preferably used in<br>

accordance with the invention are those with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl<br>
	phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as<br>
tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl)-adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
	Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example,<br>
polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones such as benzophenone and ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
	Other suitable solvents or diluents are, in particular, water, if appropriate as a mixture<br>
with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents,<br>
	emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective timber protection is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating processes, for example the vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>

Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
	Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations<br>
according to the invention have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>
Using the active compound combinations according to the invention, allows the use of heavy metals such as, for example, in bis(trialkyltin) sulphides, tri-«-butyltin<br>

According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired<br>
	and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants).<br>
Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeder's certificates. Parts<br>
	of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts<br>
and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
	rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and parts of plants with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
	 spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of<br>
-38-<br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-38-<br>
propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multilayer coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
p- to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or<br>
protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
transgenic plants and plant varieties obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in<br>
combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been<br>
explained above.<br><br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant varieties which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br><br><br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br>
The transgenic plants or plant varieties (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are<br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-39<br>
better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or 5, processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
	important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by<br>
	the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a),<br>
CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas,<br>
	glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes in question<br>
which impart the desired traits can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans),<br>
	KnockOut® (for example maize),  StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard®<br>
(cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
	phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and<br>
STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants<br>

Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
-40<br><br><br><br>
(plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant varieties having these or still-to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br><br>
The good insecticidal and acaricidal action of the active compound combinations<br>
according to the invention can be seen from the examples which follow. While the<br>
	individual active compounds show weaknesses in their action, the combinations<br>
show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
	A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the action<br>
of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the actions of the active<br>
	compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, using the formula of S.R. Colby, Weeds 15 (1967), 20-22): If<br><br>
X 	is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m ppm,<br>
-41-<br><br>
Le A 34 649-Foreign Countries<br>
41<br>
Y 	is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compound B at an application rate of ng/ha or in a concentration of n ppm and<br>
	E        is the kill rate, expressed* as a percentage of the untreated control, when<br>
employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and n g/ha or in a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
then<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the actually observed kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected kill rate (E).<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill rate in % is determined. 100% means that all the animals have been killed; 0% means that none of the animals has been killed.<br>
