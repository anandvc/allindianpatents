ORIGINAL                                                    4-2-2003<br>
	THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES<br>
THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for inputting data typically textual data.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a method and apparatus for inputting textual data in non English languages typically the Indian languages and further relates to a method and apparatus for inputting data using the very limited set of keys, which are especially available on the Mobile phones/cell phones.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a text input mechanism which enables the use of communication services such as SMS (short messaging service), wireless Internet access/email on a mobile phone a reality, particularly in non English languages.<br>
The invention requires a key pad having at least 11 keys.<br>
Although the invention was conceived and envisages its typical use for transmitting data in non English languages, it has been now discovered that the method and apparatus of this invention can also be usefully used for inputting data in English and with the added capability of transmitting  additional symbols using the limited number of keys available on a key pad, one that is commonly associated a telephone or a cellular phone instrument.<br>
It is also envisaged that the method and apparatus of this invention can be incorporated in the existing or yet to be developed word processing packages to be used with computers.<br><br>
The method of this invention though typically applied to the principle that Indian languages are of phonetic nature, is not limited or restricted in its scope to be applied to a variety of languages including English. "In accordance with the underlying principle of this invnetion, it is possible to have a common structure for inputting all the Indian languages with a limited set of keys available on certain devices. Basically it focuses on the<br>
way you see or pronounce the' way you write type or input. This type of<br>
 inputting is more accurate &amp; scientific one.<br>
Most electronic devices like mobile phones, POTS, remote controls [for<br>
TVs, VCRs, set top boxes and the like] are hand held devices having a<br><br>
limited number of keys as compared with the normal desktop or a personal<br>
computer or a typewriter. Because of the constraint of space, it is not<br>
possible to have a full blown QWERTY keyboard for hand held devices.<br>
Further the keys of the conventional hand held devices are not in principle<br>
planned for the typing in of alpha messages and sending the same when they<br>
are initially designed. The current start of telecommunications permits the<br>
sending of text messages using the mobile handset or the remote control<br>
hand sets, however because of the inherent design of these devices, sending<br>
of messages is cumbersome and most of these devices allow for inputting of<br>
the text in the English language only.	'<br><br>
The main feature of this invention is that a method and device is now made available for inputting through limited keys, typically 11, as like in cell phone or a remote hand set an English or a non English language text. The method and apparatus uses a two key press approach which is detailed as below.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided an apparatus for inputting data using limited keys for onward transmitting of data consisting of a processor which is capable of controlling all the operations of the apparatus; a key pad having at least 8 keys; a keypad driver for receiving signals from the key pad and transferring the signals in recognizable form to the processor; a display for displaying data inputted by the key pad, a display driver through which the processor communicates with the display; a first buffer in read only memory, of a storage device interfaced with the processor; consisting of [i] a code section containing a first logic means for processing data signals receivable from the keypad; a second logic means for selectively selecting either a group of characters or a single character from a group ; a third logic means for displaying the selected group or character in a group on the display; [ii] a group buffer in which different group of characters are hard coded along with a unique inputting key or set of keys for each character wherein said character is selected from a set containing consonants, half consonants, vowels and yowels signs (matras) and a [iii] a font buffer containing data for glyphs/shapes of said individual consonants, half consonants, vowels  and vowels signs; a second buffer in random access memory of a storage device interfaced with the processor consisting of :[i] key number storage means for the storage of the key number which is associated with the last key pressed on the key pad identified by the processor; [ii] a key step storage means for storage of the step number which is associated with the last key pressed on the keypad identified by the processor; [iii] graphic buffer for the storage of image of the said selected character which is composed by the processor for onward display on the display: [iv] a general buffer and scratch for storage of auto variable of a<br><br><br>
temporary nature and required for processing; and a stack for keeping the status of the variables and the context of process in a multi process mode.<br>
Typically, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the apparatus, the keypad has 11 keys.<br>
Typically, the display is divided into two zones one for displaying a class of characters and the other of displaying a character from a selected class.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the graphic buffer is a bitmap buffer.<br>
1.	The keys are organized on the device having limited keys (like numbered 0 to 9) in a manner wherein it is easy to remember.<br>
2.	Sequence on keys is as per the Basic five Vargas, non vargas, Vowels &amp; Vowel signs.<br>
3.	Basic five set of Vargas are mapped to key number 1 to 5.<br>
4.	Non-varga are mapped to key number 6 &amp; 7.<br>
5.	Vowel's &amp; Vowel signs are mapped to key number 8 &amp; 9.<br>
6.	For selecting half characters &amp; vowel signs "mode" key is defined on "*" or "#" key.<br>
7.	For backspace "cancel/c" key is used which is available on handsets.<br>
General working: In order to input text through these limited keys the<br>
sequence given below is incorporated<br>
1.	Basic set of Varga is selected by a press of key.<br>
2.	The characters within each of Varga will be displayed on the LCD of cell phone (five char, plus one numerical)<br><br><br>
3.	User can easily select the desired character by pressing .another key number as it appeared in sequence on the display.       <br>
4.	Selection of Matras &amp; half characters is done by use of mode key.<br>
5.	With this two key approach the inputting of Indian Languages is far better &amp; easy.<br>
6.	No training required for inputting using Indian Languages.<br>
The input thus done is finally presented to the application in ISCII format if<br>
required.<br>
A buffer is provided in the keypad such that the inputting done by the keys<br>
by a user is stored in the input buffer in the ISCII format and is passed to the<br>
further firmware of the apparatus for application and display.<br>

Cancel ( C ) allocated for deleting the last character or removing the entire syllable.<br>
'*' or '#' key allocated for Mode operation, which is used for typing half characters (Consonant + halant).<br><br><br>
Middleware/firmware organization:<br><br>
Rom/Flash-Rom interfaced with the, processor contains firmware for -<br>
•	Logic for handling the 'Two key press' mechanism.<br>
•	Indic onts.<br>
•	Converters for converting the data from inputted data format to the target font format which are designated as the keypad int block.<br>
•	Indiccharacter/text composition logic.<br>
•	Display logic.<br>
The apparatus for inputting data using limited keys for onward transmitting of data as seen in figure 1, consists of a processor [PROCESSOR] which is capable of controlling all the operations of the apparatus, a key pad K having at least 8 keys, a keypad driver [KEYPAD] for receiving signals from the key pad K and transferring the signals in recognizable form to the processor [PROCESSOR] ; a display [D] for displaying data inputted by the key pad K, a display driver [DISPLAY DRIVER] through which the processor communicates with the display [D] ; a first buffer [B2] in read only memory of a storage device interfaced with the processor; consisting of [i] a code section [CODE] containing a first logic means for processing data signals receivable from the keypad; a second logic means for selectively selecting either a group of characters or a single character from a group; a third logic means for displaying the selected group or character of a group on the display; [ii] a group buffer [GroupBuffer] in which different groups of characters are hard coded; and a [iii] a font buffer [FontBuffer] containing data for glyphs/shapes of individual characters; a second buffer [Bl] in<br><br><br><br>
random access memory of a storage device interfaced with the processor consisting of : [i] keynumber storage means [KEYNO] for storage of the keynumber which is associated with the last key pressed on the keypad identified by the processor; [ii] a keystep storage means [KEYSTEP] for storage of the step number which is associated with the last key pressed on the keypad identified by the processor; [iii] graphic buffer [BITMAP] for storage of an image composed by the processor for onward display on the display; [iv] a general buffer and scratch [Other Buffers &amp; Scratch Pad] for storage of auto variables of a temporary nature and required for processing; and a stack [Stack] for keeping the status of the variables and the context of process in a multi-process mode.<br>
As seen in figure 1, the keypad has 16 keys.<br>
The display D is divided into two zones a Zone Zl for displaying a class of characters and a zone Z2 for displaying a character from a selected class.<br>
The graphic buffer is typically a bitmap buffer.<br>
Functioning:<br>
The main (middleware/firmware) program on the (Flash)Rom captures the key-press and sends the key-code to the "Two key press" logic which exists on (FLASH/ROM. Depending on key-code value "Two key press" logic does one of the following operation.<br><br>
•	If key-code is for 0 to 9 key, it will display the associated Indie character group [varga] to that key to guide the user. This instruction will be, displayed in the area allocated for the displaying the instruction to guide the user.<br>
•	If key-code is for * or # key, logic will switch the mode to 'Half char mode' to allow user to enter the half Indie character to make the conjunct.<br>
•	If key-code is for "C" (Cancel) key, It will remove the last character the entire syllable from the inputted string and redisplay it on Display device.<br>
•	If key-code is for Arrow keys, it will move the cursor to the left or right as per syllable.<br>
Two key press sequence in detail.<br>
Key press 1<br>
Refer figure 2 of the accompanying drawings for first key press-event indicated by numeral 101. Signal of key value is passed as indicated by arrow marked 102 to the buffer KEYNO which is a buffer in RAM as step indicated by reference numeral 103 and the event is stored in buffer KEYSTEP another buffer in RAM as step 104. Control is then passed as indicated by arrow to the GROUP BUFFER where all characters in the group are read indicated by step 105 in the process flow. The processor then draws upon the FONT BUFFER which is a buffer in RAM indicated by step 105 to compose the bitmaps of all characters in the group in the BITMAP BUFFER indicated by step 107. The processor then sends the bitmap data to the display driver - step 108 which in turn sends instructions indicated by<br><br><br>
step 109 to display of the bitmap group characters in zone 1 at the bottom part of the display D in figure 1. This step is indicated by step 110 in figure 2 . In the first step event shown in figure 2, the zone 2 part of the display is blank.<br>
Figure 3 is the process flow diagram of the method for the second press key event indicated by the reference numeral 201. Signal of key value is passed as indicated by arrow marked 202 to the buffer KEYNO which is a buffer in RAM as step indicated by reference numeral 203 and the event is stored in buffer KEYSTEP another buffer in RAM as step 204. This buffer will be read and set to appropriate value. Control is then passed as indicated by arrow to the GROUP BUFFER where the character in the group is read as per value set by buffer KEYNO indicated by step 205 in the process flow. The processor then draws upon the FONT BUFFER which is a buffer in RAM indicated by step 206 to compose the bitmap of the selected character in the group in the BITMAP BUFFER indicated by step 207. The processor then sends the bitmap data to the display driver - step 208 which in turn sends instructions indicated by step 209 to display of the bitmap of the selected character in zone 2 in the top part of the display D. This step is indicated by step 210 in figure 2 . In the second step event shown in figure 2, the desired character is displayed in zone 2 and the instruction line in zone 1 will disappear indicated by the step 211.<br>
Thus the key press logic in accordance with this invention can select an Indie character group allocated to a key and compose the bitmaps for this group as an 'instruction message'. This bitmaps are passed to display logic to display this 'instruction message' on the Display device .<br><br><br>
