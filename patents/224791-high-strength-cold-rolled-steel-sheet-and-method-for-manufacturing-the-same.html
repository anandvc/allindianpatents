				<td>HIGH STRENGTH COLD ROLLED STEEL SHEET AND METHOD FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet used for automobiles, home appliances,<br>
and the like, more particularly to a high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet having the superior deep drawability and<br>
the tensile strenqth TS of 340 to 590 MPa, and to a<br>
manufacturing method thereof.<br>
2. Description of Related Arts<br>
Heretofore, for automobile parts having a complicated<br>
shape such as a side outer panel or a door inner panel,<br>
which are difficult to be press formed, the interstitial<br>
free (IF) mild cold rolled steel sheets (SPC270E,F) having<br>
the TS of approximately 270 MPa and the r value of 1.8 to<br>
2.0, namely the superior deep drawability have been used.<br>
In recent years, due to the further increasing needs of the<br>
lighter automobile bodies, the high strength cold rolled<br>
steel sheets having the TS of 340 to 590 MPa have been<br>
progressively applied to those parts difficult to be press<br>
formed. However, when those parts are press formed by using<br>
the high strength cold rolled steel sheets, such as a steel<br>
sheet having the TS of 340 to 390 MPa and the r value of<br>
approximately 1.7, a steel sheet having the TS of<br>
approximately 44 0 MPa and the r value of approximately 1.5,<br>
or a steel sheet having the TS of approximately 590 MPa and<br>
the r value of approximately 1.0, cracking tends to occur at<br>
the parts where the deep drawing is performed. Hence, the<br>
high strength cold rolled steel sheet having the TS of 340<br>
to 590 MPa and the higher r value is required. That is, the<br>
high strength cold rolled steel sheet having the TS of 340<br>
to 400 MPa and the r value of 1.8 or more and the high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet having the TS of 400 to 590<br>
MPa and the r value of 1.6 or more, preferably 1.7 or more,<br>
are desired.<br>
In order to increase the r value, a method has been<br>
known comprising the steps of: preparing the IF steel in<br>
which the contents of C and N are decreased as small as<br>
possible and large amounts of Ti and Nb are added; coiling a<br>
hot roiled steel sheet of the IF steel at a high temperature<br>
of 680 °C or more so as to decrease the amounts of solute C<br>
and N as small as possible, accompanied by the coarsening of<br>
the carbides and nitrides; and annealing the cold rolled<br>
steel sheet produced from the hot rolled steel sheet so as<br>
to promote the nucleation and the growth of the<br>
recrystallized grains having the texture preferable to the r<br>
value. A method to improve the r value has been also<br>
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 6-108155 and Japanese Patent No. 3291639, in<br>
which the texture preferable to the r value is developed by<br>
the formation of Ti(C,S) precipitates, using the Ti bearing<br>
IF steel in which the amounts of C and N are decreased as<br>
small as possible.<br>
The method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 6-108155 is primarily applied to<br>
a mild cold rolled steel sheet having the TS of 260 to 300<br>
MPa, and when the method is applied to the IF high strength<br>
cold rolled steel sheet containing the large amounts of P<br>
and Mr. and having the TS of 34 0 MPa or more, the large<br>
amounts of the phosphides such as Fe-Ti-P and Fe-Nb-P are<br>
formed in grain boundaries at coiling after hot rolling. As<br>
a result, the r value is extremely decreased. In the method<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3291639, it has been<br>
proposed that the high strength cold rolled steel sheet with<br>
the amount of P has the TS of 340 MPa or more and the deep<br>
drawability. However, it is believed that the cracking at<br>
press forming is caused by the non-uniform microstructure<br>
resulting from the segregation of P at casting.<br>
On the other hand, some manufacturing methods for<br>
improving the r value have also been proposed. For example,<br>
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 7-<br>
188776, a method has been disclosed in which the finish<br>
rolling is performed with the lubrication below Ar3<br>
transformation temperature. In Japanese Unexarnined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 9-279249, a method has been<br>
disclosed in which the rolling with the reduction of 1 to<br>
50 % is performed during annealing at the temperature of 550<br>
to 750 °C. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2001-131643, a method has been disclosed in<br>
which the Nb and B bearing steel, in which the amounts of Si,<br>
Mn, and P are controlled, is pickled followed by cold<br>
rolling, annealing, and rolling with the reduction of 0.3 to<br>
5 %, subsequently followed by pickling again performed and<br>
hot-dip galvanizing.<br>
However, the above-mentioned methods need the special<br>
manufacturing step, resulting in the increase in "he<br>
manufacturing cost and the decrease in the productivity.<br>
That is, by the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 7-188776, the<br>
recrystallization annealing of the hot rolled steel sheet is<br>
required. In the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 9-279249, a rolling mill<br>
which can be used at the high temperature is required in the<br>
annealing furnace. In the method disclosed in Japanese <br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-131643,<br>
the pickling, the annealing and the skin pass rolling must<br>
be performed twice, respectively.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

cold rolled steel sheet comprising the steps of: heating a<br>

1,080 to 1,350 °C; hot rolling the heated slab at a<br>

480 = CT = 580 + 0.17/{ ( [Ti]+0.08X [sol.Al] ) X [P] } •••• (5),<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Through the detailed investigation by the inventors of<br>
the present invention on the influence of various alloy<br>
elements on the r value of the IF high strength cold rolled<br>
steel sheet, the following findings were obtained.<br>
I) When the content of sol.Al is larger than that of<br>
the conventional high strength cold rolled steel sheet, the<br>
r value is significantly improved. In particular, the<br>
effect is significant when the content of Mn is set to 0.4 %<br><br>
or more.<br>
II) The addition of Si and P is effective for improving<br>
the r value.<br>
III} When the coiling temperature after hot rolling and<br>
the contents of ?, sol.Al, and Ti are optimized in addition<br>
to the content of Nb when it is added, the high r value can<br>
be obtained.<br>
The present invention is based on the findings<br>
described above, and hereinafter, the details thereof will<br>
be described.<br>
1) Content of sol.Al and r value<br>
In order to investigate the relation between the<br>
content of sol.Al and the r value, the following test was<br>
performed.<br>
The slab containing 0.002 % of C, 0.25 % of Si, 0.08 %<br>
of ?, 0.007 % of S, 0.015 % of Nb, 0.03 % of Ti, 0.002 % of<br>
N, and 0.001 % of B was heated to 1,250 °C, in which the<br>
contents of sol.Al and Mn were varied from 0.01 to 1.2 % and<br>
from 0.6 to 1.8 %, respectively. The slab was hot rolled to<br>
3 mm thick, followed by soaking at 580 °C for one hour as<br>
the coiling simulation. The hot rolled steel sheet was cold<br>
rolled to 0.75 mm thick, continuously annealed at 820 °C for<br>
60 seconds, and subjected to skin pass rolling with the<br>
elongation of 0.7 %. The r value and the TS were evaluated<br>
by the following methods.<br>
The r value and the TS were measured using JIS No. 5<br>
test pieces cut in the direction of 0° , 4 5° , and 90° to the<br>
rolling direction, respectively. The average value of the r<br>
value and the TS was calculated with the following equation,<br>
respectively.<br>
The average value = ( [To] +2 [T45] + [T90] ) /4 ,<br>
where [To] , [T45] and [T90] are the values of the r value or<br>
the TS measured in the direction of 0° , 45° , and 90° to the<br>
rolling direction, respectively.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the content of<br>
scl.Al and the r value and the TS. In the figure, black<br>
circles indicate the results obtained when the content of Mn<br>
is 1.3 %, and white circles indicate the results obtained<br>
when the total content of sol.Al and Mn is 1.8 %.<br>
When the content of Mn is 1.8 %, the r value is 1.6 or<br>
more at the sol.Al content of 0.1 % or more, is 1.7 or more<br>
at the sol.Al content of 0.2 to 0.7 %, and decreases at the<br>
sol.Al content of more than 0.7 %. The TS exceeds 460 MPa<br>
at the sol.Al content of 0.1 % or more and increases with<br>
the increase in the sol.Al content.<br>
The increase in TS is 35 MPa when the content of the <br>
sol.Al is increased by 1 %. Since it is approximately<br>
equivalent to solid solution hardenability of Mn, when the<br>
total content of sol.Al and Mn is set to 1.8 %, the relation<br>
between the TS and the r value, in which the TS is<br>
substantially constant, can be obtained as shown with the<br>
while circles. Therefore, it is understood that when the<br>
sol.Ai is added and the content of Mn is cecreased, the high<br>
r value can be obtained with the constant TS.<br>
In addition, when the content of sol.Al is more than<br>
1 %, the precipitation of fine A1N in the austenite grain<br>
boundaries at the continuous casting of slab and causes the<br>
deterioration of the grain boundary strength, which leads to<br>
the cracking in the surface of the slab by the plastic<br>
deformation at the casting or at the rough rolling. The<br>
surface defects with the scale tend to be caused by the<br>
cracking of the slab surface, so that the surface quality of<br>
the final product seriously deteriorates.<br>
Therefore, even if the TS is more than 400 M?a, when<br>
the content of sol.Al is controlled in the range of 0.1 to<br>
1 %, preferably 0.2 to 0.7 %, the high r value of 1.6 or<br>
more, preferably 1.7 or more can be obtained, respectively.<br>
The reason why the high r value becomes high when the<br>
content of sol.Al is set in the range of 0.1 to 1 % is<br>
considered as follows. That is, since Al increases the Ar3<br>
transformation temperature, the coarsening of the carbides<br>
and the decrease in the amount of solute C are caused by the<br>
precipitation of the/at the high temperature below the Ar3<br>
transformation temperature through the transformation from<br>
the austenite into the ferrite after the hot rolling; hence,<br>
the recrystailization texture preferable to the r value is<br>
developed at annealing. In addition, it may be also<br>
believed that the change in the cold rolling texture caused<br>
by the presence of Al contributes to the improvement in the<br>
r value.<br>
2) Contents of Si and P, and r value<br>
In order to investigate the relation between the<br>
contents of Si and ? and the r value, using the slab<br>
containing 0.002 % of C, 1 % of Mn, 0.007 % of S, 0.25 % of<br>
sol.Al, 0.02 % of Nb, 0.01 % of Ti, 0.002 % of N, and<br>
0.001 % cf 3 in which the contents of Si and P were varied<br>
from 0.005 to 1.5 % and from 0.003 to 0.15 %, respectively,<br>
the same test as above-mentioned was performed.<br>
In Fig. 2, the relationship between -he r value and<br>
[Si]+10X[P] is shown. In the figure, the values represent<br>
the contents of Si in each steel.<br>
In the steel containing 0.25 % of sol.Al, according to<br>
the present invention, when the following equation (2) is<br>
satisfied, the high r value of 1.7 or more can be obtained.<br>
0.3 = [Si]+10X [P] = 1.4 --- (2) ,<br>
where [M] represents the content (mass %) of the element M.<br>
However, when the content of Si and 10 times the<br>
content cf P both exceed 1.5 %, the r value is very much<br>
decreased. Therefore, the contents of Si and P are set to<br>
1.5 % or less and 0.15 % or less, respectively.<br>
When the hot-dip galvannealing is applied to the high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet of the present invention,<br>
Si and P tend to cause the decrease in the adhesion of the<br>
coating, and hence the contents of Si and P are preferably<br>
set to 0.5 % or less and 0.08 % or less, respectively. In<br>
addition, since Si and P are effective elements for the<br>
solid solution hardening, the amounts of Si and P are<br>
preferably set to 0.003 % or more and 0.01 % or more,<br>
respectively.<br>
3) Other elements<br>
C: C is combined with Ti and Nb to form carbides. When<br>
the content of C is more than 0.015 %, the amount of<br>
carbides is increased, and the r value is extremely<br>
decreased. Hence, the content of C is set to 0.015 % or<br>
less, preferably 0.008 % or less, and more preferably less<br>
than 0.004 %. Since C has the effect of increasing the<br>
strength by the precipitation hardening when C precipitates<br>
as TiC and NbC, the content of C is preferably se: to<br>
0.004 % or more for the steel sheet having the TS of<br>
approximately 440 MPa. That is, when the content of C is<br>
set to 0.004 to 0.008 %, and the atomic ratio of Ti or Nb<br>
against C is 1.0 or more, the increase in the TS can be<br>
achieved without decreasing the r value. When the content<br>
of C is less than 0.0005 %, the ferrite grains coarsen at<br>
annealing, so that the surface defect which is called<br>
"orange peel" tends to occur at press forming. Therefore,<br>
the content of C is preferably set to 0.0005 % or more.<br>
Mn: Mn is the effective element for the solid solution<br>
hardening which is essential to the IF high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet. In order to obtain the TS of 340 MPa or<br>
more, the content of Mn must be set to 0.4 % or more. When<br>
the content of Mn is more than 3 %, the r value is extremely<br>
decreased, and hence the content of Mn is set to 3 % or less,<br>
preferably 2 % or less, and more preferably 1.5 % or less.<br>
The reason why the r value is decreased by the<br>
increment of Mn content is not clarified; however, it is<br>
considered that the decrease in the r value is caused by the<br>
interaction of Mn with solute C and by the suppression of<br>
the development in the recrystallization texture preferable<br>
to the r value at annealing, which is brought about by the<br>
fine carbides precipitation and the increase in the amount<br>
of solute C at hot rolling because of the decrease in the<br>
Ar3 transformation temperature by the addition of Mn.<br>
S: S exists as sulfides in steel. When the content of<br>
S is more than 0.02 %, the ductility is decreased, and hence<br>
the content thereof is set to 0.02 % or less, preferably.set<br>
to 0.01 % or less. In view of descaling, the content of S<br>
is preferably set to 0.004 % or more.<br>
N: When the content of N is more than 0.01 %, fine A1N,<br>
NbN, and Nb(C,N) are precipitated in the austenite grain<br>
boundaries at slab continuous casting and causes the<br>
embrittlement of the grain boundaries, and as a result, the<br>
cracking tends to occur in the slab surface at the<br>
continuous casting or at the subsequent rough rolling.<br>
Hence, the content of N is set to 0.01 % or less. The<br>
content of N is preferably decreased as small as possible;<br>
however, it is too difficult to decrease the content of N<br>
below approximately 0.001 % by the smelting technique.<br>
Ti: Ti has the effect of improving the r value by the<br>
grain refinement of the hot bands or by the decrease in the<br>
solute C and N with the formation of precipitates thereof.<br>
In order to fully obtain the effect of Ti described above,<br>
the content of Ti should be controlled to satisfy the<br>
following equation (1).<br>
1 = ([Ti]/48)/([C]/12+[N]/14) .... (1),<br>
where [M] represents the content (mass %) of the element M.<br>
However, even when the content of Ti is more than 0.2 %,<br>
the increase in the r value is small, and hence the content<br>
of Ti is set to 0.2 % or less. When the hot-dip<br>
galvannealing is performed on the high strength ccld rolled<br>
steel sheet of the present invention, in order to prevent<br>
the non-uniform coating, the content of Ti is preferably set<br>
to C.04 % or less. In addition, in order to obtain the high<br>
r value by the addition of Ti, the content of Ti is<br>
preferably set to 0.005 % or more.<br>
The balance includes Fe and the inevitable impurities.<br>
Besides the elements described above, 0.002 % or more<br>
of Nb is preferably further added in order to obtain the<br>
higher r value. The contents of Nb, Ti, C, and N must be<br>
controlled so as to satisfy the following equation (3).<br>
1 = ([Nb]/93+[Ti]/48)/( [C]/12+[N]/14) .... (3),<br>
where [M] represents the content (mass %) of the element M.<br>
However, when the content of Nb is more than 0.02 %,<br>
fine NbN and Nb(C,N) precipitate in the austenite grain<br>
boundaries at slab continuous casting and lead to the<br>
embrittlement of the grain boundaries, and as a result, the<br>
cracking tends to occur in the slab surface at the casting<br>
or as the subsequent rough rolling. Hence, the content of<br>
Nb is set to 0.02 % or less.<br>
Furthermore, when 0.0001 % or more of B is added, the<br>
resistance to the secondary work embrittlement is improved.<br>
However, when the content of B is more than 0.003 %, the<br>
effect of improving the anti-secondary work embrittlement is<br>
small, and the decrease in the r value and the increase in<br>
the rolling take place. Hence, the content of B is set to<br>
0.003 % or less.<br>
Besides the elements described above, in order to<br>
further improve the strength, the resistance to secondary<br>
work embrittlement, and the r value, at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of 0.03 to 0.5 % of Cu,<br>
0.03 to 0.5 % of Ni, 0.03 to 0.5 % of Cr, 0.05 to 0.3 % of<br>
Mo, and 0.005 to 0.5 % of V may be added. Since Cu and Cr<br>
deteriorate the surface quality, the contents thereof are<br>
each se: to 0.5 % or less. The addition of Ni causes the<br>
remarkable increase in cost, and hence the content thereof<br>
is set to 0.5 % or less. Although Mo has the less adverse<br>
influence or. the resistance to the secondary work<br>
embrittleinent and is effective for increasing the strength,<br>
the addition of Mo causes the increase in the yield strength<br>
which deteriorates the accuracy of the surface shape after<br>
press forming. Hence, the content of Mo is set to 0.3 % or<br>
less. Although V has also the less adverse influence on the<br>
resistance to the secondary work embrittlement and is<br>
effective for increasing the TS, the cost is largely<br>
increased when the content is more than 0.5 %. Hence, the<br>
content of V is set to 0.5 % or less. In addition, when Cu<br>
is added, Ni is preferably added with the content equivalent<br>
to that of Cu.<br>
In order to improve the zinc coating appearance, the<br>
zinc coating adhesion, the resistance to the fatigue, the<br>
anti-secondary work embrittlement, or the like, it is<br>
effective that at least one element selected from the group<br>
ccrisisting of 0.002 to 0.2 % of Sb and 0.002 to 0.2 % of Sn<br>
is contained, and that the following equation (4) is<br>
satisfied.<br>
0.002 = [Sb]+[Sn]/2 = 0.2 •••(4),<br>
where [M] represents the content (mass %) of the element M.<br>
The addition of Sb and Sn prevents the surface<br>
nitridation and oxidation of the steel at slab heating,<br>
coiling, or annealing in a box annealing furnace (BAF), a<br>
continuous annealing line (CAL), a continuous hot-dip<br>
galvanizing line (CGL), and hence improves the non-uniform<br>
coating and the deterioration of the coating adhesion. In<br>
addition, the surface appearance can also be improved by the<br>
prevention of the adhesion of zinc oxides in a molten zinc<br>
bath. Furthermore, Sb and Sn reduce the surface oxidation<br>
and suppress the degradation in the resistance to the<br>
fatigue and the degradation in the toughness after press<br>
forming.<br>
However, when the contents of Sb and Sn exceed 0.2 %,<br>
the zinc coating adhesion and the toughness deteriorate.<br>
4) Manufacturing method<br>
The high strength cold rolled steel sheet of the<br>
present invention can be manufactured by a method comprising<br>
the steps of: heating a slab having the chemical composition<br>
described above at 1,080 to 1,350 °C; hot rolling the heated<br>
slab at a finishing temperature between (the Ar3<br>
transformaticn temperature-20) °C and (the Ar3<br>
transformation temperature+150) °C into a hot rolled steel<br>
sheet; coiling the hot rolled steel sheet at a coiling<br><br>
temperature CT which satisfies the following equation (5)<br>
when Nb is not added or the following equation (6) when Nb<br>
is added; cold rolling the hot rolled steel sheet with a<br>
reduction of 50 to 90 % into a cold rolled steel sheet; and<br>
continuously annealing the cold rolled steel sheet at a<br>
temperature of 750 to 870 °C or box annealing the cold<br>
rolled steel sheet at a temperature of 600 to 750 °C.<br>
480 = CT = 580 + 0.17/{ ( [Ti]+0.08X [sol.Al] ) X [P] } ••• (5),<br>
and<br>
480 = CT = 580 + 0. 17/{ (0.6X [Nb]+[Ti]+0.08X [sol. Al] ) X [P] }<br>
.... (6) ,<br>
where [H] represents the content (mass %) of the element M.<br>
In order to sufficiently dissolve the phosphides such<br>
as Fe-Ti-P or Fe-Nb-P formed in the slab, the heating<br>
temperature SRT before hot rolling is set to 1,080 °C or<br>
more. However, when the temperature is more than 1,350 °C,<br>
the surface quality deteriorates. Therefore, the SRT is set<br>
to 1,350 °C or less.<br>
In order to obtain the excellent surface appearance,<br>
not only the primary scale but also the secondary scale at<br>
hot rolling should be sufficiently removed. During the hot<br>
rolling, heating by using a bar heater may also be performed,<br>
The finishing temperature FDT of hot rolling is set to<br>
the temperature between (the Ar3 transformation temperature-<br>
20) °C and (the Ar3 transformation temperature+150) °C for<br><br>
the grain refinement of hot bands.<br>
The coiling temperature after hot rolling has the<br>
significant influence on the r value of the cold rolled<br>
steel sheet of the present invention which contains Al, P,<br>
and Ti and also contains Nb when it is necessary to be added.<br>
In the IF steel containing P, the phosphides such as Fe-Ti-P<br>
and Fe-Nb-P unfavorable for the r value tend to be<br>
precipitated. In general, the r value is significantly<br>
improved due to the coarsening of precipitates and the<br>
decrease in solute C by soaking at the high coiling<br>
temperature. However, when the coiling temperature is<br>
higher than the appropriate temperature, the phosphides as<br>
above mentioned are formed, and as a result, the r value is<br>
extremely decreased.<br>
Through studies on the optimum coiling temperatures for<br>
various types of steel containing Al, P, and Ti and also<br>
containing Nb when it is necessary to be added, it is found<br>
that when the coiling temperature CT is more than<br>
580 + 0.17/{ ( [Ti]+0.08 X [sol.Al])X [P] } in which Nb is not<br>
added or is more than 580 + 0.17/{ (0.6X [Nb] + [Ti]+0.08X<br>
[sol.Al]) X [?] } in which Nb is added, the phosphides are<br>
formed, and which causes the remarkable decrease in the r<br>
value. When the coiling temperature CT is less than 480 CC,<br>
even when the phosphides are not formed, precipitation of<br>
carbides becomes insufficient at coiling, decreasing the r<br>
value. Hence, the coiling temperature CT must satisfy the<br>
equation (5) or (6).<br>
The coiling temperature is preferably in the range<br>
between (the maximum value-40) °C and (the maximum value) °C<br>
in the equation (5) or (6).<br>
In view of the improvement in the r value, the<br>
reduction of the cold rolling is set to 50 to 90 %,<br>
preferably to 65 to 80 %.<br>
The annealing temperature AT is set to 750 to 870 °C<br>
when the continuous annealing is performed in CAL or CGL.<br>
When the annealing temperature AT is less than 750 °C, the<br>
ferrite recrvstallization does not occur sufficiently, and<br>
hence the high r value cannot be obtained. In addition, the<br>
elongation becomes extremely small. When the annealing<br>
temperature AT is more than 870 °C and more than the Ar3<br>
transformation temperature in case of the steel containing<br>
high Mn content, the strength is extremely increased, and<br>
the elongation and then value are extremely decreased. In<br>
order to obtain the higher r value and the higher elongation,<br>
the annealing temperature is preferably 820 °C or more. In<br>
addition, since the annealing time is long in case of the<br>
box annealing, the annealing temperature is set in the range<br>
of 600 to 7 50 °C.<br>
The coating containing zinc may be formed on the<br>
annealed steel sheet by the electrolytic coating or the hot-<br>
dip coating. The coating containing zinc may be, for<br>
example, zinc coating, alloy zinc coating, zinc-nickel alloy<br>
coating, or the like. In addition, after the coating, the<br>
organic film may be also coated.<br>
Example<br>
Various types of steel Nos. A to X shown in Table 1<br>
were smelt and continuously cast into slabs having a<br>
thickness of 230 mm. After heating these slabs at the<br>
heating temperature SRT shown in Table 2, they were hot<br>
rolled to 3.2 mm thick, at the finishing temperature FDT<br>
shown in Table 2, followed by the coiling at the coiling<br>
temperature CT shown in Table 2. The hot bands were cold 10<br>
0.3 mm thick and subsequently annealed at rhe annealing<br>
temperature AT shown in Table 2 in CAL, CGL, or BAF,<br>
followed by skin pass rolling with the elongation of 0.8 %,<br>
thereby producing steel sheet Nos. 1 to 34. In CGL, the<br>
annealed steel sheets were immersed in the molten zinc bath<br>
at the temperature of 460 °C, and heated at the temperature<br>
of 500 °C in the in-line alloying furnace. The amount of<br>
2<br>
zinc on one side surface was 45 g/m .<br>
The r value and the TS were measured by the methods<br>
described above. In addition, the surface defects were<br>
measured by eye inspection so as to evaluate the surface<br>
cualitv.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
In both Tables 1 and 2, [Nb] of the equation in the<br>
topmost column is zero when Nb is not added. <br>
In steel sheets Nos. 1 to 24 according to the examples<br>
of the present invention, the r value is l.8 or more when<br>
the TS is 340 to 400 MPa, the r value is 1.6 or more when<br>
the TS is 400 to 590 MPa, and the surface quality is also<br>
superior. In addition, compared to steel sheets of<br>
comparative examples having equivalent strength to that of<br>
the examples, it is understood that the r value of the<br>
examples of the present invention is significantly high. In<br>
particular, when the content of Mn is more than 1 %, the<br>
effect described above becomes remarkable.<br>
On the other hand, in steel sheets Nos. 25 to 34<br>
according to the comparative examples, neither the r value<br>
of 1.8 or more at the TS of 340 to 400 MPa nor the r value<br>
of 1.6 or more at the TS of 400 to 590 MPa can be obtained.<br>
In steel sheets Nos. 27, 28, and 29 corresponding to the<br>
conventional high strength cold rolled steel sheet<br>
containing the large amount of Mn, the r value is small. In<br>
addition, in steel sheets Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34, at<br>
least one of the ratio (Nb+Ti)/(C+N), the content of C, that<br>
of Si, that of Mn, that of P, that of sol.Al, and that of Nb<br>
is out of the range of the present invention, and hence the<br>
r value is small. In particular, according to steel sheet<br><br>
No. 30 among those mentioned above corresponding to the<br>
conventional low carbon high strength cold rolled steel<br>
sheet, in which the content of C and the ratio (Nb-Ti) / (C+N)<br>
are not appropriately controlled and in which solute C and<br>
Mn coexist, even when the content of sol.Al is increased,<br>
the high r value cannot be obtained. According to steel<br>
sheets Nos. 31 and 34, in which the content of Nb and the<br>
contents of Nb and sol.Al are out of the range of the<br>
present invention, respectively, the surface quality is<br>
inferior.<br>
In addition, it is understood that according to steel<br>
sheet No. 25 corresponding to the conventional mild cold<br>
relied steel sheet SPC270F and steel sheet No. 26 which<br>
contains the large amount of sol.Al, the effect of the<br>
addition of sol.Al on the improvement in the r value is<br>
small when the contents of Mn and P are small.<br>
