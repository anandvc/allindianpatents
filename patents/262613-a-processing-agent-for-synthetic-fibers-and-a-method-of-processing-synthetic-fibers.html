				<td>Backgound of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to agents for the processing of synthetic fibers and methods of processing synthetic fibers.<br>
The production speed of synthetic fibers has been increasing rapidly in recent years. At the same time, there has been a tendency to increase the production of new kinds of synthetic fibers such as low denier synthetic fibers, high multifilament synthetic fibers and modified cross-section synthetic fibers. If synthetic fibers of such new types are produced at a higher speed, their friction increases with the yarn passing, guides, rollers and heater. This causes an increase in the friction-charged electrostatic potential, resulting in low cohesion and unwanted tension variations of synthetic fibers, and the problems of fluffs and yarn breaking tend to occur. The present invention relates to agents for and methods of processing synthetic fibers capable of sufficiently preventing the occurrence of fluffs and yarn breaking as well as dyeing specks even when synthetic fibers of the aforementioned new kinds are produced at an increased production rate.<br>
Examples of prior art processing agents for synthetic fibers for preventing the occurrence of fluffs and yarn breaking at the time of their high rate of production include (1) processing agents for synthetic fibers containing polyether compounds with a molecular weight of 1000-20000, comprising a dialkylamine to which alkylene oxide(s) having 2-4 carbon atoms have been added by random or block addition (such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 6-228885); (2) processing agents for synthetic fibers containing a branched-chain polypropylene glycol having 4 or more branched chains (such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 10-273876); (3) processing agents for synthetic fibers containing a polyether lubricant having 10-50 weight % of a polyether block of number average molecular weight of 1000-10000 with block copolymerization of ethylene oxide<br>
and propylene oxide at a weight ratio of 80/20-20/80 (such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 2001-146683); and (4) processing agents for synthetic fibers containing a polyoxyalkylene glycol with a number average molecular weight of 5000-7000 with copolymerization of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide at a weight ratio of 40/60-20/80, a monocarboxylic acid having 8-14 carbon atoms and an alkylamine salt having 6-14 carbon atoms or a quaternary ammonium salt (such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 10-245729).<br>
These prior art processing agents are not sufficiently capable of preventing the occurrence of fluffs, yarn breaking and dyeing specks when synthetic fibers are produced at a fast rate and in particular when synthetic fibers of the aforementioned new kinds are produced at a fast rate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a processing agent and a process method capable of sufficiently preventing the occurrence of fluffs, yarn breaking and dyeing specks even when new kinds of synthetic fibers such as low denier synthetic fibers, high multifilament fibers and modified cross-section synthetic fibers are produced at a fast rate.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery by the present inventor, as a result of his studies in view of the object described above, that a processing agent containing a<br>
hydroxy compound of a specified kind at least as a part of a functional improvement agent<br>
should be applied to the synthetic fibers in a specified amount.<br>

Part 3 (Attachment of processing agents to synthetic fibers, false twisting and evaluation)<br>
Each of the processing agents prepared in Part 2 was diluted with water to prepare a 10% aqueous solution. After polyethylene terephthalate chips with intrinsic viscosity of 0.64 and containing titanium oxide by 0.2% were dried by a known method, they were spun at 295°C by using an extruder. The 10% aqueous solution thus prepared was applied onto the yarns extruded out of the nozzle to be cooled and solidified by a guide oiling method using a measuring pump such that the attached amount of the processing agent became as shown in Table 4. Thereafter, the yarns were collected by means of a guide and wound up at the rate of 3000m/minute without any drawing by a mechanical means to obtain partially oriented 56 decitex-144 filament yarns as wound cakes of 10kg.<br>
False twisting<br>
The cakes thus obtained as described above were subjected to a false twisting process under the conditions described below by using a false twister of the contact heater type (product name of SDS1200 produced by Teijinseiki Co., Ltd.):<br>
Fabrication speeds:    800m/minute and 1200m/minute;<br>
Draw ratio:	1.652;<br>
Twisting system:       Three-axis disk friction method (with one guide disk on the inlet side, one guide disk on the outlet side and four hard polyurethane disks);<br>
Heater on twisting side:	Length of 2.5m with surface temperature of 210°C;<br>
Heater on untwisting side;     None;<br>
Target number of twisting;    3300T/m. The false twisting process was carried out under the conditions given above by a continuous operation of 25 days.<br>
Evaluation of fluffs<br>
In the aforementioned false twisting process, the number of fluffs per hour was measured by means of a fly counter (produce name of DT-105 produced by Toray<br>
Engineering Co., Ltd.) before the false twisted yarns were wound up and evaluated according to the standards as described below:<br>
A:       The measured number of fluffs was zero;<br>
A-B:    The measured number of fluffs was less than 1 (exclusive of zero);<br>
B:       The measured number of fluffs was 1-2;<br>
C:       The measured number of fluffs was 3-9;<br>
D:       The measured number of fluffs was 10 or greater. The results of the measurement are shown in Table 4.<br>
Evaluation of yarn breaking<br>
The number of occurrences of yarn breaking during the 25 days of operation in the false twisting process described above was converted into the number per day and such converted numbers were evaluated according to the standards as described below:<br>
A:       The number of occurrence was zero;<br>
A-B:    The number of occurrence was less than 0.5 (exclusive of zero);<br>
B:       The number of occurrence was 0.5 or greater and less than 1;<br>
C:       The number of occurrence was 1 or greater and less than 5;<br>
D:       The number of occurrence was 5 or greater. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Dyeing property<br>
A fabric with diameter of 70mm and length of 1.2m was produced from the false-twisted yarns on which fluffs were measured as above by using a knitting machine for tubular fabric. The fabric thus produced was dyed by a high temperature and high pressure dyeing machine by using disperse dyes (product name of Kayalon Polyester Blue-EBL-E produced by Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd.). The dyed fabrics were washed with water, subjected to a reduction clearing process and dried according to a known routine and were thereafter set on an iron cylinder with diameter 70mm and length lm. An inspection process for visually counting the number of points of densely dyed potion on the fabric surface was repeated five times and the evaluation results thus obtained were<br>
converted into the number of points per sheet of fabric. The evaluation was carried out according to the following standards:<br>
A:       There was no densely dyed portion;<br>
A-B:   There was 1 point of densely dyed portion;<br>
B:       There were 2 points of densely dyed portion;<br>
C:       There were 3-6 points of densely dyed portion;<br>
D:       There were 7 or more points of densely dyed portion. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
This invention, as described above, has the favorable effects of sufficiently preventing the occurrence of fluffs, yarn breaking and dyeing specks even when synthetic fibers of new kinds such as low denier synthetic fibers, high multifilament synthetic fibers and modified cross-section synthetic fibers are being produced at a fast rate.<br>
