Ortho-substituted pentafluoride sulfanyl-benzenes, method for the production thereof and the use thereof in the form of valuable synthesis intermediate stages<br>
The chemistry of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives has gained importance in the last few years, especially since novel preparation processes have been found (Tetrahedron 56 (2000) 3399; Organic Letters 4(17) (2002) 3013). However, to date only very few compounds are known which bear substituents other than hydrogen and fluorine on a phenyl ring in the ortho-position to the pentafluorosulfanyl group. The only known synthetic route (Journal of Fluorine Chemistry 112 (2001) 287) uses expensive reagents such as AgF2 and is afflicted with poor yields. The authors account for this by the large bulk of the pentafluorosulfanyl group which generally makes ortho-substitution very difficult. This opinion is also shared by other authors (J.Am. Chem. Soc. 84 (1962) 3064). It is therefore surprising that it is possible to electrophilically substitute in the ortho-position to the pentafluorosulfanyl group. In this way, novel ortho-substituted pentafluorosulfanylbenzenes are obtained which constitute valuable intermediates, for example for preparing medicaments, diagnostic aids, liquid crystals, polymers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematicides, parasiticides, insecticides, acaricides and arthropodicides.<br>

The present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Alkyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This also applies if they<br>

Heteroaryl radicals are aromatic ring compounds in which one or more ring atoms are oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms, for example 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, 1 or 2 oxygen atoms, 1 or 2 sulfur atoms or a combination of different heteroatoms. The heteroaryl radicals may be attached via all positions, for example via the 1-position, 2-position, 3-position, 4-position, 5-position, 6-position, 7-position or 8-position. Heteroaryl radicals may be unsubstituted or be mono- or polysubstituted, for example mono-, di- or trisubstituted, by identical or different radicals. This applies likewise to heteroaryl radicals, for example in the heteroarylalkyl radical. Examples of heteroaryl are furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, indolyl, indazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl and cinnolinyl.

The invention further relates to a process for preparing the compounds of the formula I or the salts thereof, which comprises converting compounds of the formula II by electrophilic aromatic substitution to compounds of the formula I<br><br>
where R1 to R5 are each as defined above.<br>
In the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, the procedure is to<br>
carry out an electrophilic aromatic substitution, preferably a halogenation,<br>
chlorosulfonation or nitration.<br>
In one embodiment, halogenation (R1 = Cl, Br or I) is affected as described<br>
in  R.C.  Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to<br>
Functional Group Preparations, VCH Publishers, New York, Weinheim,<br>
1999, pages 619-628 and in the literature cited therein. The chlorination is<br>
effected,   for  example,   with   NCIS   in   an   inert  solvent,   for  example<br>
isopropanol, CHCI3, CH2CI2 or EA at a temperature between -30°C and<br>
100°C, preferably between 40°C and the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
In  another embodiment,  sulfonation  or chlorosulfonation  (R1 = SO2R6<br>
where R6 is OH or Cl) is effected as described in March's Advanced Organic Chemistry 5th edition 2001, pages 702-703 and in the literature cited therein.<br>
In another embodiment, nitration (R1 = NO2) is effected as described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Organo-Stickstoff-Verbindungen IV, part 1, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1992, pages 262-341 and in the literature cited therein. Compounds of the formula II where R3 = COOH are nitrated, for example, with a mixture of<br><br>
90% HNO3 and 96% H2SO4 at a temperature between -40°C and 80°C, preferably between 0°C and 40°C.<br>
From the compounds of the formula I where R1 = NO2, it is possible to prepare the corresponding anilines (R1 = NH2) as described in R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations, VCH Publishers, New York, Weinheim, 1999, 821-828 and the literature cited therein. From these anilines, it is possible to synthesize, via the diazonium salts by methods known to those skilled in the art, as described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Organo-Stickstoff-Verbindungen I, part 2, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1990, pages 1060-1136 and in the references cited therein, the compounds of the formula I with further definitions of R1.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae II are commercially available or can be prepared by processes similar to those described in the literature and/or known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the starting compounds, functional groups may also be present in protected form or in the form of precursors, and then be converted to the desired groups in the compounds of the formula I prepared by the process described above. Appropriate protecting group techniques are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The workup and, if desired, the purification of the products and/or intermediates is effected by conventional methods such as extraction, chromatography or crystallization and conventional dryings.<br>
Also claimed are the compounds of the formula I and/or the salts thereof for use as a synthetic intermediate, in particular for use as a synthetic intermediate for preparing medicaments, diagnostic aids, liquid crystals, polymers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematicides, parasiticides, insecticides, acaricides and arthropodicides.<br>
Examples of the various possible uses of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives are described in the following publications: WO 9421606, WO 03093228 (insectides,     acaricides);     DE19711953,     GB 2276379     (herbicides);<br><br>

Chem. 2000, 112, 4384 (liquid crystals); WO 03097591, DE 10353202 (medicaments, diagnostic aids); US 5220070, US 5302692 (polymers); WO 03093228, WO 9625401 (pesticides); GB 2276381, GB 2276380 (fungicides), US 5637607 (nematicides), WO 9947139 (parasiticides), US 6531501, WO 9516676 (arthropodicides).<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be isolated in the form of their salts.<br>
These are obtained by the conventional methods by reaction with acids or<br>
bases. Useful acid addition salts are, for example, halides, especially<br>
hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, lactates, sulfates, citrates, tartrates,<br>
acetates, phosphates, methylsulfonates, benzenesulfonates,<br>
p-toluenesulfonates, adipates, fumarates, gluconates, glutamates,<br>
glycerolphosphates, maleates, benzoates, oxalates and pamoates and<br>
trifluoroacetates, and in the case of the preparation of active ingredients<br>
preferably pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If the compounds contain an<br>
acidic group, they can form salts with bases, for example alkali metal salts,<br>
preferably sodium or potassium salts, or ammonium salts, for example as<br>
salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids. They may also be in<br>
the form of a zwitterion.<br>

Example 1     2-Methyl-5-nitro-4-pentafluorosulfuranylbenzoic acid<br><br>
a)	4-Aminophenylsulfur pentafluoride<br><br>
A solution of tin(ll) chloride (1465 g, 7.73 mol) in concentrated (32 percent) aqueous HCI solution was heated with stirring to 80°C and then, with ice cooling, 4-nitrophenylsulfur pentafluoride (584 g, 2.344 mol) was introduced in 8 portions within 1 h. The internal temperature was kept below 100°C. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at an internal temperature of 85°C for 1.5 h and then allowed to cool to 45°C within a further hour. A mixture of ice (12 kg), NaOH (2 kg) and dichloromethane (1.51) was prepared and added to the reaction mixture with vigorous stirring. The phases were separated, the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with 1 I each time of dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. 510 g of 4-aminophenylsulfur pentafluoride were obtained as a bright yellow crystalline powder, m.p. 63-65X (lit: 57-59°C)<br>
b)	4-Amino-3-bromophenylsulfur pentafluoride<br><br>
4-Aminophenylsulfur pentafluoride (510 g, 2.327 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (7 I), the solution was cooled to 5°C and, while stirring, 1,3HJibromo-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione   (326 g,    1.14 mol)   was<br><br>
introduced in several portions with ice cooling such that the internal temperature was kept at 3-8°C (about 1 h). Subsequently, the mixture was stirred without external cooling for 1 h and allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture was filtered through a bed of silica gel (volume about 1 I) and washed with dichloromethane (5.5 I), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. About 700 g of a red-brown crystalline mass were obtained and were dissolved in n-heptane (600 ml) at 60°C and then crystallized in a refrigerator at 4°C. Filtration with suction gave 590 g (85%) of 4-amino-3-bromophenylsulfur pentafluoride as brownish crystals, m.p. 59-59.5°C.<br>
c)	4-Amino-3-methyiphenylsulfur pentafluoride<br>
A mixture of CS2CO3 (794 g, 2.7 mol), dimethoxyethane (21), water (300 ml) and trimethylboroxine (50 percent solution in THF, 225 g, 0.9 mol) was heated to 70°C, PdCl2 (dppf) • CH2CI2 (37 g, 45 mmol) was added, and a solution of 4-amino-3-bromophenylsulfur pentafluoride (270 g, 0.9 mol) in dimethoxyethane (400 ml) was added dropwise within 2 h while the reaction mixture was heated to reflux. It was subsequently heated to reflux for a further 3 h and then cooled to room temperature, diluted with MTB (500 ml), filtered through a silica gel column (14x7 cm, 70-200 pm) and washed with MTB (2500 ml). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. 490 g of a black, semicrystalline mass were obtained and were subjected to a steam distillation. A total of 5.5 I of condensate was collected, from which the crystals of the product separated out. The condensate was extracted 3 times with MTB, and the combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. 4-Amino-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride (181 g, 76%) was obtained as colorless crystals, m.p. 65-66°C.<br>
d)	4-Bromo-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride<br><br>
A mixture of tert-butyl nitrite (90 percent, 37 ml, 280 mmol) and CuBr2<br><br>
(35.8 g, 160mmol) in acetonitrile (260 ml) was cooled to 5°C and, while stirring and cooling with ice, a solution of 4-amino-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride (30.9 g, 132.5 mmol) in MTB (140 ml) was added dropwise at 5-8°C within 1 h. Evolution of nitrogen started after about 2 min. The mixture was then allowed to warm with stirring to room temperature within 1 h, a mixture of ice (250 g), 26 percent aqueous NH3 solution (50 ml) and<br>
MTB (250 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The phases were separated, the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with MTB (150 ml each time), and the combined organic phases were shaken once with 400 ml of water. Drying with Na2SO4 and evaporation of the organic phase gave 39 g of 4-bromo-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride as a red-brown oil which was contaminated with 8 mol% 4,5-dibromo-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride, but was used further without further purification. Yield 89% based on a purity of 90%.<br>
e) 4-Cyano-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride<br><br>
A mixture of 4-bromo-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride (136.4 g, purity 80%, 0.367 mol), Zn(CN)2 (72.8 g, 0.62 mol) and Zn dust (7.2 g, 0.11 mol) in dimethylacetamide (900 ml) and water (40 ml) was initially charged with nitrogen sparging, heated to 125°C with stirring, and PdCl2(dppf) • CH2CI2 (32.7 g, 40 mmol) was added. After stirring at 125°C for one hour, PdCl2(dppf) • CH2CI2 (16.3 g, 20 mmol) and Zn dust (3.6 g, 55 mmol) was again added, and stirring was continued at 125°C for 2 h. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with n-heptane (400 ml) and stirred vigorously with addition of 5 N aqueous NH4CI solution (250 ml) and water (450 ml) for 15 min. The mixture was filtered with suction through a layer of kieselguhr, the phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with n-heptane (200 ml). The combined organic phases were shaken with water (450 ml), dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting black<br>
residue was dissolved in 200 ml of n-heptane, filtered and again concentrated under reduced pressure. 78 g of a dark brown liquid were obtained and were purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (7 x 55 cm, 60-200 jim, 4:1 to 3:2 n-heptane/dichloromethane). The first<br><br>
fraction obtained was 6.5 g of 4-bromo-3-methyiphenylsulfur pentafluoride (reactant) as yellowish liquid, and then 71.1 g (80%) of 4-cyano-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride as a pale yellow oil.<br>
f)	2-Methyl-4-pentafluorosulfuranylbenzoic acid<br><br>
A mixture of 4-cyano-3-methylphenylsulfur pentafluoride (41.2 g, 169.4 g), NaOH (20.4 g, 510mmol) and water (60 ml) in ethylene glycol (160 ml) was heated to 130°C and stirred at this temperature for 4 h. It was then cooled to room temperature and diluted with MTB (150 ml) and water (250 ml), and the mixture was filtered with suction. The phases of the filtrate were separated, and the aqueous phase was acidified with concentrated aqueous HCI solution, and the precipitated solid was filtered off with suction. 41.1 g (93%) of 2-methyI-4-pentafluorosulfuranylbenzoic acid were obtained as colorless crystals, m.p. 138-139°C.<br>
g)	2-Methyl-5-nitro-4-pentafluorosulfuranylbenzoic acid<br>
6.0 g of 2-methyl-4-pentafluorosulfuranylbenzoic acid were dissolved in 60 ml of a 90% aqueous HNO3 solution and, at RT, 6 mi of a 96% H2SO4 were added dropwise. The mixture was left to stand at RT for 28 h, then poured onto 300 g of ice, 300 ml of water were added, the mixture was stirred for 1 h and then the product was filtered off. The pale yellow solid was dried in air to give 6.5 g, m.p. 218-220°C.<br>
