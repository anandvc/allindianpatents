				<td>POLYMERIZATION PROCESS AND CONTROL OF POLYMER COMPOSITION PROPERTIES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to the polymerization of olefins in a single reactor<br>
using bimetallic catalysts, and more particularly to the control of the flow index and/or<br>
amounts of polymer composition components ("split") by the addition of a control agent that,<br>
in certain embodiments, is selective for one catalyst component of the bimetallic catalyst<br>
composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Broad or bimodal molecular weight distribution polymer compositions are<br>
compositions that typically include one or more high molecular weight polymers and one or more low molecular weight polymers. In bimodal molecular weight distribution polymer compositions, the weight fraction of the high molecular weight ("HMW") polymer typically ranges from, for example, 0.10 to 0.90 for applications reC1uiring broad molecular weight distribution polymers. The relative amount of HMW polymer in the polymer composition can influence the rheological properties of the composition. One such measurable rheological property of bimodal polymer compositions is its flow index ("FI", or lai, measured at 190Â°C, 21.6 kg according to ASTM D-1238). The ki of the bimodal polymer composition, in one embodiment, possesses an lai that is between 2 and 100 dg/min. This range represents a balance between processability (desiring relatively high fei) on the one hand, and product (film, etc.) toughness (desiring relatively low lai) on the other hand. Hence, it is necessary to control polymer composition lai in the polymerization reactor.<br>
[0003]	One desirable method of produC1ng bimodal polymer compositions is through<br>
the use of a bimetallic catalyst composition in a single reactor such as disclosed in, for example, US 5,882,750 and US 6,274,684. Such compositions incorporate at least two, preferably two, metal centers, both of which may be the same or different metal with similar or differing coordination spheres, patterns of substitution at the metal center or ligands bound to the metal center. Typically, one of the metal centers produces a low molecular weight ("LMW") polymer while the other produces a HMW polymer in the single polymerization reactor, and desirably, although not necessarily, simultaneously. US 5,525,678 to Mink et al. discloses the use of water and carbon dioxide in controlling the I21 using one such bimetallic<br>
catalyst composition. WO 02/46246 to Mctwson et a!.; US 6,420,474 and 6,569,963 to Nowlin et al. disclose the addition of an additional catalyst to adjust the relative amounts of HMW and LMW polymers in a polymer composition. However, the products resulting therefrom, such as bimodal resins used to make films, may still suffer from gel formation, the reaction process itself may be subject to fouling, which causes an undesirable need to shut down the polymerization reactor, and further, the procedure of adding a catalyst component can add cost and complexity to the process.<br>
[0004]	What is needed is an improved method of controlling I21 in the manufacture of<br>
bimodal polymer compositions when using bimetallic catalyst compositions. While many types of compounds have been disclosed for use in polymerization reactors, for example in WO 01/00691; US 6,596,824; US 6,417,299; US 6,417,298; US 6,313,236; US 5,733,988, US 5,625,012; US 5,244,987; US 5,200,502; US 5,194,526; US 5,066,736; US 4,855,370; and EP 1 159 311, EP 0 630 910 and EP 0 315 192; and Soviet Union Patent No. 1 249 025, there is still the problem of effective I21 control in the manufacture of bimodal polymer compositions when using bimetallic catalyst compositions. The inventors have unexpectedly found that there exists a broad class of compounds useful as I21 control agents, or "split" control agents, that also have other advantages as described herein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	One aspect of the present invention provides a method of produC1ng a polymer<br>
composition comprising incorporating a high molecular weight ("HMW") polymer into a low molecular weight ("LMW") polymer to form the polymer composition in a single polymerization reactor in the presence of polymerizable monomers, a bimetallic catalyst composition and at least one control agent; wherein the control agent is added in an amount suffiC1ent to control the level of incorporation of the high molecular weight polymer, the level of low molecular weight polymer, or both. In this manner the flow index of the polymer composition, a bimodal polyethylene composition in one embodiment, can be controlled. Described another way, the "split" or relative ratios of HMW to LMW polymer of the polymer composition can be controlled by the method of the inventions described herein.<br>
[0006]	In one aspect of the invention, the polymer composition is produced in. a gas<br>
phase fluidized bed reactor using a bimetallic catalyst composition comprising a metallocene<br>
and a titardum/magnesium based Ziegler-Natta catalyst supported on an inorganic oxide support material. The control agent in one embodiment is any compound or composition that has a reactive moiety capable of altering the catalyst activity or productivity of at least one catalyst component of the bimetallic catalyst composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.0       General Definitions<br>
[0010]	As used herein, in reference to Periodic Table "Groups" of Elements, the "new"<br>
numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups are used as in the CRC HANDBOOK OF<br>
CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS (David R. Lide ed., CRC Press 81st ed. 2000).<br>
[0011]	As used herein, the term "substituted" means that the group following that term<br>

2.0      Use of the Control Agent<br>
[0013]	The present invention is directed to a method of controlling the rheological<br>
properties of a polymer composition generated by a bimetallic catalyst composition in a single reactor, the control affected by the use of "control agents"; the control agents are added in an amount suffiC1ent to alter the relative ratios, or "split" of the HMW and LMW polymer components of the polymer compositions. More particularly, the present invention is directed to maintaining certain rheological properties of the polymer composition at a desirable "target", one such property being the I21 of the polymer composition, the rheological properties being maintained at the target level by the addition of control agents.<br>
[0014]	One aspect of the present invention is a method of produC1ng a polymer<br>
composition comprising incorporating a high molecular weight polymer into a low molecular weight polymer to form the polymer composition in a single polymerization reactor in the presence of polymerizable monomers, a bimetallic catalyst composition and at least one control agent; wherein the control agent is added in an amount suffiC1ent to control the level of incorporation of the high molecular weight polymer, the level of low molecular weight polymer, or both. The "polymer composition" in one embodiment is a bimodal polymer composition, and in a more particular embodiment, a bimodal polyethylene composition wherein from greater than 80 wt% of the monomer derived units of the composition are ethylene and the remaining 0 to 20 wt% are derived from C3 to C12 olefins and diolefins, described further herein.<br>
[0015]	The term "incorporation" is not herein limited to any particular method of<br>
combining the HMW and LMW polymers, and may comprise any techniC1ue known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, "incorporating" refers to the in situ blending of HMW and LMW polymers together as they are being formed in the polymerization reactor(s); and in yet a more particular embodiment, the in situ blending of HMW and LMW polymers together as they are being formed in a single polymerization reactor in a single stage process.<br>
[0016]	Another aspect of the present invention is a method of controlling the In of a<br>
polymer composition comprising forming a high molecular weight polymer and a low molecular weight polymer in a single polymerization reactor in the presence of polymerizable monomers, a bimetallic catalyst composition and at least one control agent; wherein the control agent is added in an amount suffiC1ent to control the level of incorporation of the high molecular weight polymer, the level of low molecular weight polymer, or both.<br>
i<br>
[0017]	Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of produC1ng a polymer<br>
composition comprising contacting a bimetallic catalyst composition, a control agent and polymerizable monomers in a single polymerization reactor; characterized in that the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises a first catalyst component and a second catalyst component, wherein the first catalyst component is capable of produC1ng a low molecular weight polymer and the second catalyst component is capable of produC1ng a high molecular weight polymer; and wherein the control agent substantially alters the polymerization activity of the first or second catalyst component relative to the second or first catalyst component, respectively. In a particular embodiment, the control agent substantially lowers the polymerization productivity (or activity) of the second catalyst component relative to the first catalyst component.<br>
[0018]	The polymer compositions of the present invention include at least one low<br>
molecular weight ("LMW") polymer and at least one high molecular weight ("HMW") polymer, and in one embodiment include one of each. The LMW polymer and HMW polymers are incorporated into one another either seC1uentially or simultaneously in a single polymerization reactor, and are incorporated into one another simultaneously in a single polymerization reactor in a particular embodiment. Polymerization reactors are well known in the art; preferable polymerization reactors include those capable of polymerizing olefins to form polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, etc., such as gas phase, and solution or slurry phase reactors. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the polymerization reactor is a fluidized-bed, gas phase reactor such as disclosed in WO 03/044061 and US 4,003,712,<br>
typically comprising at least one reactor, only one reactor in a particular embodiment, the reactor comprising a reaction zone and a veloC1ty reduction zone or expanded region; the polymerization reactor further comprising at least one recycle line that is continuous from one portion, preferably a top portion of a vertical reactor, to another portion, preferably a bottom portion of a vertical reactor, having a heat exchanger therebetween. The bimetallic catalyst composition and primary monomers, ethylene in a particular embodiment, as well as hydrogen and other gases, enter the reactor wherein the reaction zone comprises a bed of growing polymer particles maintained in a fluidized state. In one embodiment,- unreacted gases flow through the fluidized bed of growing polymer particles, into the expanded region of the reactor where solid polymer particles are allowed to settle, then pass through the recycle line, wherein the gasses are cooled in a heat exchanger before reentering the reactor through a remaining portion of the recycle line.<br>
[0019]	The LMW polymer in one embodiment is a polyolefin, and more particularly, a<br>
polyethylene homopolymer or copolymer comprising from 0 to 10 wt% â¬3 to C1o a-olefin derived units, and more particularly, a homopolymer of ethylene or copolymer of ethylene and 1-butene, 1-pentene or 1-hexene derived units. The LMW polymer can be characterized by a number of factors. The weight average molecular weight of the LMW polymer ranges from 4,000 to 200,000 amu (Daltons) in one embodiment, and from 5,000 to 100,000 amu in another embodiment, and from 5,000 to 80,000 amu in another embodiment, and from 5,500 to 50,000 amu in yet another embodiment, and from 6,000 to 20,000 amu in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable weight average molecular weight of the LMW polymer can comprise any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit described herein.<br>
[0020]	The HMW polymer in one embodiment is a polyolefin, and more particularly, a<br>
polyethylene homopolymer or copolymer comprising from 0 to 10 wt% Ca to C1C1 a-olefin derived units, and more particularly, a homopolymer of ethylene or copolymer of ethylene and 1-butene, 1-pentene or 1-hexene derived units. The weight average molecular weight of the HMW polymer ranges from 50,000 to 1,000,000 amu (Daltons) in one embodiment, and ranges from 100,000 to 800,000 in another embodiment, and from 250,000 to 700,000 amu in another embodiment, and from 300,000 to 600,000 amu in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable weight average molecular weight of the HMW polymer can comprise any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit described herein.<br>
[0021]	The polymer composition of the invention, comprising at least the HMW and<br>
LMW polymers, can be described by any number of parameters; and in one embodiment possesses a "weight average" molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of from 2.5 to 150, a "z-average" molecular weight distribution (Mz/Mw) of from 2 to 10, an I2 (190Â°C/2.16 kg) of from 0.01 to 10 g/10 cm, an I2i (190Â°C/21.6 kg) of from 2 or 4 to 100 or 500 dg/min, and a density in the range of from 0.890 to 0.970 g/cm3. One desirable measure of the polymer composition properties is its flow index or fei, as this value often determines the usefulness of the polymer composition for a given end use application. In one aspect of the present invention, this parameter of the polymer composition of the invention is controlled by the introduction of a control agent in conjunction with a bimetallic catalyst composition into the polymerization reactor. In a particular embodiment, the polymer composition consists essentially of one HMW polymer and one LMW polymer.<br>
[0022]	The control agent can be introduced into any portion of the polymerization<br>
reactor, and may be introduced with or separate from the bimetallic catalyst composition, separate from the bimetallic catalyst composition in a particular embodiment. In one embodiment, the control agent is introduced into the recycle line of a fluidized-bed gas phase reactor comprising a recycle line and reactor, and in a more particular embodiment, is introduced into the recycle line upstream of the heat exchanger.<br>
[0023]	The control agent in one embodiment is any chemical compound having a<br>
reactive moiety capable of affecting the polymerization productivity of at least one catalyst component of the bimetallic catalyst composition. Examples of such include alcohols, ethers, thiols, amines nitrogen oxides, oxygen, and other oxygen or sulfur or nitrogen-containing compounds. The control agent excludes water and carbon dioxide; however, in one embodiment, water is added to the polymerization reactor in addition to the control agent. The control agent is not part of the bimetallic catalyst composition, but is a distinct component or composition added to the polymerization reactor separately; the control agent is introduced in a distinct physical location in the reactor relative to the introduction of the bimetallic catalyst composition to the polymerization reactor in a particular embodiment. In one embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition is introduced to the fluidized bed portion of a gas phase<br>
polymerization reactor and the control agent is introduced into the recycle line of the same reactor, either simultaneously or intermittently relative to the introduction of the catalyst.<br>
[0024]	The control agent can be further described by any number or combination of<br>
features, hi one embodiment, the control agent is in a nebulous or gaseous state at a temperature of from 50Â°C to 120Â°C and a pressure of from 1 to 100 bar (or from 100 to 10,000 kPa). By "nebulous", it is meant that the control agent may, as a liC1uid or solution, be in a mist or "atomized" state at the given temperature and pressure range, preferably, in such a state when present in the polymerization reactor to which it is introduced. In another embodiment, the control agent is in a nebulous or gaseous state at a temperature of from 70Â°C to 100Â°C and a pressure of from 10 to 80 bar (or from 1000 kPa to 7,900 kPa). In a more particular embodiment, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, amines (alkylamines, ammonia, and salts thereof), 62, carbon monoxide, and mixtures thereof; and even more particularly, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C1o alcohols, Ca to C1e ethers, Ca to C1o aldehydes, C3 to C1e ketones, ammonia and C1 to Gig alkylamines, 62, carbon monoxide, and mixtures thereof; and yet even more particularly, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C1C1 alcohols, C2 to C1o ethers, 62, and mixtures thereof. In yet another embodiment, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C1o mono-alcohols and â¬2 to C1o mono-ethers, d to â¬5 alcohols, â¬2 to Cs ethers, amines, oxygen, and combinations thereof; and in yet another more particular embodiment, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C1C1 mono-alcohols and C2 to C1o mono-ethers, amines, oxygen, and combinations thereof; and in yet a more particular embodiment, the control agent is selected from the group consisting of C1 to C1o mono-alcohols and C2 to Cjo mono-ethers, oxygen, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0025]	The  "alkylamines"  described herein  include  compounds  of the  formula<br>
R/R^N, wherein N is nitrogen and each of R^R2, and R3 are bound to the nitrogen and independently selected from hydrogen, halogens and alkyls; independently selected from hydrogen, chloride, bromide, and Cj to C1e alkyls in a particular embodiment; wherein at least one R group is an alkyl group. Examples of such compounds include trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, dibutylaminechloride, dimethylaminehydride, and mixtures thereof. The alkylamine useful in the present invention is not herein limited to its physical form, and includes salts of alkylamines. Further, ammonia is not limited to NH3, but includes<br>
its hydrated form and/or salts of ammonia (e.g., ammonium bromide, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium alum, etc.).<br>
[0026]	Examples of alcohols include linear, branched and cyclic alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, octanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, and mixtures thereof. Examples of ethers include linear, branched and cyclic ethers such as diethylether, dibutylether, tetrahydrofuran, 2,6-dimethyoxyphenol, methylphenylether and mixtures thereof, and other compounds including both "ether" and "alcohol" moieties. The "mono-alcohols" are those comprising only one hydroxyl group; "mono-ethers" are those comprising only one carbon-oxygen-carbon moiety.<br>
[0027]	Water may also be present (or added to the polymerization reactor) with the<br>
control agent in a particular embodiment; water is present from 1 to 50 wt ppm based on the flow rate of the primary monomer in one embodiment., and present from 2 to 40 wt ppm in another embodiment; and present from 3 to 30 wt ppm in yet another embodiment. Although it is known that water can influence the HMW/LMW split and fC1 of the polymer composition (US 5,525,678), it has been unexpectedly found that a combination of water and a control agent also controls these parameters. Alternately, the control agent alone in the substantial absence of water is also useful. By "substantial absence", it is meant that water is not added to the reactor, and if present, is present to less than 1 wt ppm based on the flow rate of the primary monomer.<br>
[0028]	The use of the control agent is not herein limited by the means of introduC1ng<br>
the control agent to the polymerization reactor. The control agent may be dissolved in a diluent (e.g., a â¬4 to C1o branched or linear alkane, water, alcohol, ether) at any concentration and added to the polymerization reactor, and/or may be added along as a liC1uid or slurry, and/or may be accompanied by a carrier gas such as nitrogen, etc, and may be combined with one or more other control agents. Desirably, once in the reactor, the control agent is in a nebulous or gaseous form. The control agent may be introduced to the reactor in an amount that varies with time, or at a constant rate (within instrumental error), and is added at a constant rate in a particular embodiment.<br>
 [0029]	The control agent is added to the polymerization reactor in an amount suffiC1ent<br>
to control the level of incorporation of the HMW polymer, the level of LMW polymer, or both (or the "split"); stated another way, the control agent is added in an amount to influence, either increase or decrease, the Izi value of the polymer composition produced in the polymerization reactor. In one embodiment, the control agent is added in an amount suffiC1ent to increase or decrease, decrease in a particular embodiment, the level of incorporation of the HMW polymer by from 0.5 to 50 wt% in one embodiment, and from 1 to 40 wt% in another embodiment, and from 2 to 30 wt% in yet another embodiment, and from 3 to 20 wt% in yet another embodiment, and from 4 to 10 wt% in yet another embodiment based on the total amount of polymer composition, wherein a desirable range of reduction comprises any combination of any upper wt% limit with any lower wt% limit described herein.<br>
[0030]	The amount of increase or decrease of the HMW polymer (and LMW polymer)<br>
is described relative to its level in the absence or lack of change in a constant value in the amount of control agent. The control agent and/or water may be added in any level to maintain the rheological properties of the polymer composition of the invention at a desirable level. Thus, for example, while the control agent may be added in an amount to decrease the HMW polymer by from 0.5 to 10 wt%, this addition may be in response to a countervailing event or phenomena that has caused the HMW polymer to increase to an undesirable (or "non-target") level. Thus, in this manner, the level of HMW and LMW polymer (and hence, the rheological properties such as ki) can be maintained or "controlled" at a desirable target level.<br>
[0031]	The control agent can also be characterized by the amount it influences the level<br>
of the LMW polymer of the polymer composition. In one embodiment, the level of the LMW polymer increases or decreases, preferably decreases, by from 0, or 1, or- 2 or 5 to 10 or 15 or 20 wt% based on the total amount of polymer composition, upon introduction of a control agent to the polymerization reactor. The control agent may influence the HMW polymer independent of the LMW polymer in one embodiment; in another embodiment, the HMW and LMW polymers are simultaneously influenced by the presence of the control agent.<br>
[0032]	Described in yet another way, the control agent is added in an amount to<br>
substantially alter, or in a particular embodiment, lower the polymerization productivity of at least one catalyst component of the bimetallic catalyst composition; in one embodiment in an<br>
amount to substantially lower the productivity of the second catalyst component (described herein) relative to the first catalyst component. By "substantially lower", it is meant that the polymerization productivity and/or activity of the affected catalyst component decreases in the presence of the control agent by from less than 2 or 5 or 10 to 80 or 100 or 200 % in one embodiment, relative to the catalyst productivity in the absence of control agent. By "substantially alter", it is meant that the polymerization productivity and/or activity of the affected catalyst component decreases or increases in the presence of the control agent by from less than 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 to 80 or 100 or 200 % in one embodiment, relative to the catalyst productivity in the absence of control agent.<br>

[0034]	It is known in the art that chemical agents may be used as "electron donors" in<br>
certain catalyst compositions, such as in US 6,191,239; US 4,356,295; US 4,312,783; EP 0 500 530; EP 0 103 120 and EP 0 102 503. In those disclosures, the use of such chemical agents is as an electron donor to the catalyst composition, and the chemical agent is part of the catalyst itself. The control agents of the present invention are distinct in that they are not part of the catalyst composition, and hi a particular embodiment are added to the polymerization reactor separate from the bimetallic catalyst composition. In a more particular embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition is added to the fluidized bed of a gas phase reactor, while the control agent is added to the recycle line of the gas phase reactor. In the present invention, the control agent is added at a level suffiC1ent to effectuate the control of the LMW/HMW ratio ("split") and/or the I21. And in a more particular embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition and control agent contact one another exclusively in the recycle line of the polymerization reactor upon first introduction of the control agent to the polymerization reactor.<br><br>
 [0035]	The control agent is introduced into a polymerization reactor being operated in<br>
conjunction with a bimetallic catalyst composition. Such bimetallic catalyst compositions comprise at least two, preferably two, metal centers, both of which may be the same or different metal with similar or differing coordination spheres, patterns of substitution at the metal center or ligands bound to the metal center. In one embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises a first catalyst component and a second catalyst component, wherein the first catalyst component is capable of produC1ng a low molecular weight polymer and the second catalyst component is capable of produC1ng a high molecular weight polymer. In a particular embodiment, the first and second catalyst components are supported on a support medium such as an inorganic oxide or polymer support material; either one or both catalysts are supported on a collection of the same support material.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises at least two<br>
catalyst components selected from the group consisting of metallocenes, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, metal-amido catalysts, and chromium catalysts, the compounds capable of catalyzing the polymerization of olefins to form polyolefins.

Ziegler-Natta catalysts are disclosed in, for example, EP 0 703 246; US 5,525,678 and US 5,290,745. Examples of metal-amido catalysts are disclosed in, for example, Lan-Chang Liang, Richard R. Schrock, William M. Davis and David H. McConvilk, 121 J. AM. CHEM. Soc. 5797-5798 (1999); US 6,593,438; 6,380,328 and US 6,274,684. Examples of chromium catalysts are disclosed in, for example, US 3,887,494; 3,119,569; 3,900,457; 4,981,831; 4,364,842; and 4,444,965; and include chromium-cyclopentadienyls, chromium oxides, chromium alkyls, supported and modified variants thereof as is common in the art. The bimetallic catalyst composition may comprise a combination of two or more of the same class of catalyst compounds, for example, two metallocenes as disclosed in U.S. 4,530,914.<br>
[0037]	In a more particular embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises<br>
a metallocene, and another catalyst component selected from the group consisting of titanium and magnesium-containing Ziegler-Natta catalysts and metal-amido catalysts. In yet another embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises a metallocene, and a titanium and<br>

reactor such that the molar ratio of control agent to titanium of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst ranges from 0.01 to 30; and from 0.05 to 20 hi another embodiment, and from 2 to 18 hi yet another embodiment, and from 4 to 16 in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range comprises any upper limit combined with any lower limit described herein. In a particular embodiment, the control agent substantially reduces the polymerization productivity of the Ziegler-Natta component of the bimetallic catalyst composition comprising metallocene and titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst components.<br>
[0039]	The present invention can be described by any suitable combination of<br>
embodiments described herein to effectuate the control of the I2i of the polymer composition produced by the method of the invention, or control the level of incorporation of the HMW and LMW polymers of the polymer compositions. The first and second catalyst components of the bimetallic catalyst, supports, activators, methods of polymerization, polymer compositions and other components are described further herein.<br>
[0040]	For example, one embodiment of the method of polymerizing monomers to<br>
produce a polymer composition as described herein comprises combining a bimetallic catalyst composition hi the fluidized bed of a gas phase reactor with monomers, preferably olefins, and an amount of hydrogen at a temperature of from 50Â°C to 120Â°C, and optionally with from 1 to 50 ppm of water, to obtain the polymer composition having a flow index value A; followed by the introduction of a continuous amount of a control agent ranging from 0.1 to 50 ppm based on the rate of primary monomer introduction to the polymerization reactor, preferably ethylene, the introduction of control agent being at the recycle line upstream from the heat exchanger of the polymerization reactor, in order to obtain a polymer composition having a flow index value of B; wherein A and B differ by more than 2, or 4, or 10, or 20 dg/min or more hi ki value; and wherein in a particular embodiment, the value of A is lower than the value of B by between 2 or 4 or 10 or 20 dg/min or more in \2\ value. By "continuous amount", it is meant an amount<br>
that is substantially constant (within experimentally controllable and measurable error) for at least 0.5 to 10 hours or more.<br>
[0041]	Of course, the process can also be carried out in reverse order, starting with an<br>
amount of control agent, with water optionally, followed by the decrease or removal of the control agent; and the individual elements of the method can be varied as described herein. Further, other agents that may have a reverse influence on the split and/or fC1, such as a C4 to C1o alkane or an aluminum alkyl, may be added simultaneously or intermittently to achieve a balance of li\ and/or split in the polymer composition.<br>

In one embodiment, the at least two catalyst components selected from the group consisting of metallocenes, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, metal-amido catalysts, and chromium catalysts ("Phillips-type catalysts"). In a particular embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition comprises two catalyst compounds, a first and second catalyst component, both of which are supported on a support medium. The first catalyst component is capable of produC1ng the LMW polymer, and the second catalyst component is capable of produC1ng the HMW polymer as described herein.<br>
[0043]	In a more particular embodiment, the first catalyst component is a metallocene,<br>
and the second catalyst component is a titanium/magnesium based Ziegler-Natta catalyst component. In yet a more particular embodiment, the first and second catalyst components are supported on a support medium with an activator suitable to activate the first catalyst component. In one embodiment, the supported activator is an alumoxane, and in another embodiment, a non-coordinating activator, and in yet another embodiment, a mixture of the two activators. In one embodiment, the activator suitable for activating the Ziegler-Natta catalyst is added to the polymerization reactor such that the bimetallic catalyst composition can make contact with that activator. This is described in, for example, RE 33,683, wherein an<br>
aluminum alkyl such as trimethylaluminum is added to the polymerization reactor to effectuate the activation of a titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst component.<br>

3.2      The second catalyst component<br>
[0059]	The second catalyst component capable of produC1ng a HMW polymer of the<br>
polymer composition is a Ziegler-Natta catalyst compound in one embodiment. Ziegler-Natta catalyst compounds are disclosed generally in ZIEGLER CATALYSTS 363-386 (G. Fink, R. Mulhaupt and H.H. Brintzinger, eds., Springer-Verlag 1995); and more particularly in EP 103 120; EP 102 503; EP 0 231 102; EP 0 703 246; RE 33,683; US 4,302,565; US 5,518,973; US 5,525,678; US 5,288,933; US 5,290,745; US 5,093,415 and US 6,562,905. Examples of such catalysts include those comprising Group 4, 5 or 6 transition metal oxides, alkoxides and halides, and more particularly oxides, alkoxides and halide compounds of titanium, zirconium or vanadium; optionally in combination with a magnesium compound, internal and/or external electron donors (alcohols, ethers, siloxanes, etc.), aluminum or boron alkyl and alkyl halides, and inorganic oxide supports.<br>
[0060]	The Ziegler-Natta catalyst is  combined with a support material in one<br>
embodiment, either with or without the second catalyst component. The first catalyst component can be combined with, placed on or otherwise affixed to a support in a variety of ways. In one of those ways, a slurry of the support in a suitable non-polar hydrocarbon diluent<br><br>
is contacted with an organomagnesium compound, which then dissolves in the non-polar hydrocarbon diluent of the slurry to form a solution from which the organomagnesium compound is then deposited onto the carrier. The organomagnesium compound can be represented by the formula RMgR', where R' and R are the same or different C2-C12 alkyl groups, or C4-C10 alkyl groups, or C4-C6 alkyl groups. In at least one speC1fic embodiment, the organomagnesium compound is dibutyl magnesium. In one embodiment, the amount of organomagnesium compound included in the silica slurry is only that which will be deposited, physically or chemically, onto the support, for example, being bound to the hydoxyl groups on the support, and no more than that amount, since any excess organomagnesium compound may cause undesirable side reactions. Routine experimentation can be used to determine the optimum amount of organomagnesium compound. For example, the organomagnesium compound can be added to the slurry while stirring the slurry, until the organomagnesium compound is detected in the support solvent. Alternatively, the organomagnesium compound can be added in excess of the amount that is deposited onto the support, in which case any undeposited excess amount can be removed by filtration and washing. The amount of organomagnesium compound (moles) based on the amount of dehydrated silica (grams) generally range from 0.2 mmol/g to 2 mmol/g hi a particular embodiment.<br>
[0061]	In  one   embodiment the  Ziegler-Natta  catalyst,   optionally  including  the<br>
organomagnesium compound, is contacted with an electron donor, such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or an organic alcohol having the formula R"OH, where R" is a C1-C12 alkyl group, or a C1 to C8 alkyl group, or a C2 to C4 alkyl group, and/or an ether or cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran. In a particular embodiment, R"OH is n-butanol. The amount of organic alcohol is used in an amount effective to provide an R"OH:Mg mol/mol ratio of from 0.1 to 10, or from 0.2 to 1.5, or from 0.4 to 1.2, or from 0.6 to 1.1, or from 0.9 to 1.0.<br>
[0062]	The organomagnesium and alcohol-treated slurry is contacted with a non-<br>
metallocene transition metal compound. Suitable non-metallocene transition metal compounds are compounds of Group 4 and 5 metals that are soluble in the non-polar hydrocarbon used to form the silica slurry in a particular embodiment. Non-limiting examples of suitable Group 4, 5 or 6 transition metal compounds include, for example, titanium and vanadium halides, oxyhalides or alkoxyhalides, such as titanium tetrachloride (TiCU), vanadium tetrachloride<br><br>
 (VCLt) and vanadium oxytrichloride (VOC13), and titanium and vanadium alkoxides, wherein the alkoxide moiety has a branched or unbranched alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in a particular embodiment from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Mixtures of such transition metal compounds may also be used. The amount of non-metallocene transition metal compound used is suffiC1ent to give a transition metal to magnesium mol/mol ratio of from 0.1 to 5, or from 0.3 to 1.5, or from 0.5 to 0.8. The diluent can then be removed in a conventional manner, such as by evaporation or filtering, to obtain the dry, supported first catalyst component.<br>
[0063]	The first and second catalyst components may be contacted with the support in<br>
any order. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the first catalyst component is reacted first with the support as described above, followed by contacting this supported first catalyst component with a second catalyst component.<br>
[0064]	When combined to form the bimetallic catalyst component, the molar ratio of<br>
metal from the second catalyst component to the first catalyst component (e.g., molar ratio of Ti:Zr) is a value of from 0.1 to 100 in one embodiment; and from 1 to 50 in another embodiment, and from 2 to 20 in yet another embodiment, and from 3 to 12 in yet another embodiment; and from 4 to 10 in yet another embodiment, and from 4 to 8 in yet another embodiment; wherein a desirable molar ratio of second catalyst component metahfirst catalyst component metal is any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit described herein.<br>
3.3      The support<br>
[0065]	A support may also be present as part of the bimetallic catalyst system of the<br>
invention. Supports, methods of supporting, modifying, and activating supports for single-site catalyst such as metallocenes is discussed in, for example, 1 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 173-218 (J. Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000). The terms "support" or "carrier", as used herein, are used interchangeably and refer to any support material, a porous support material in one embodiment, including inorganic or organic support materials. Non-limiting examples of support materials include inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides, and in particular such materials as talc, clay, silica, alumina, magnesia, zirconia, iron oxides, bbria, calC1um oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide, thoria, aluminum phosphate gel, and polymers such as polyvinylchloride and substituted polystyrene, functionalized or crosslinked<br><br>
organic supports such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefins or polymeric compounds, and mixtures thereof, and graphite, in any of its various forms.<br>
[0066]	The support may be contacted with the other components of the catalyst system<br>
in any number of ways. In one embodiment, the support is contacted with the activator to form an assoC1ation between the activator and support, or a "bound activator". In another embodiment, the catalyst component may be contacted with the support to form a "bound catalyst component". In yet another embodiment, the support may be contacted with the activator and catalyst component together, or with each partially in any order. The components may be contacted by any suitable means as in a solution, slurry, or solid form, or some combination thereof, and may be heated when contacted to from 25Â°C to 250Â°C.<br>
[0067]	Desirable carriers are inorganic oxides that include Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 14<br>
oxides and chlorides. Support materials include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium chloride, graphite, and mixtures thereof in one embodiment. Other useful supports include magnesia, titania, zirconia, montmorillonite (EP 0 511 665 Bl), phyllosilicate, and the like. Also, combinations of these support materials may be used, for example, silica-chromium, silica-alumina, silica-titania and the like. Additional support materials may include those porous acrylic polymers described in EP 0 767 184 B1.<br>
[0068]	In one aspect of the support useful in the invention, the support possess a<br>
surface area in the range of from 10 to 700 m2/g, pore volume in the range of from 0.1 to 4.0 cm3/g and average particle size in the range of from 5 to 500 urn. In another embodiment, the surface area of the carrier is in the range of from 50 to 500 m2/g, pore volume of from 0.5 to 3.5 cm3/g and average particle size of from 10 to 200 um. In yet another embodiment, the surface area of the carrier is in the range is from 100 to 400 m2/g, pore volume from 0.8 to 3.0 cm3/g and average particle size is from 5 to 100 ^tm. The average pore size of the carrier of the invention typically has pore size in the range of from 10 to 1000A, from 50 to 500A in another embodiment, and from 75 to 350A in yet another embodiment. In yet a more particular embodiment, the support is an inorganic oxide having an average particle size of less than 50 urn or less than 35 jam and a pore volume of from 0.8 to 1 to 2 or 5 cnrVg.<br><br>
 [0069]	Dehydration or calC1ning of the support may or may also be carried out. In one<br>
embodiment, the support is calC1ned prior to reaction with the fluorine or other support-modifying compound. In another embodiment, the support is calC1ned and used without further modification, or calC1ned, followed by contacting with one or more activators and/or catalyst components. Suitable calC1ning temperatures range from 100Â°C to 1500Â°C in one embodiment, and from 200Â°C to 1200Â°C in another embodiment, and from 300Â°C to 1000Â°C in another embodiment, and from 350Â°C to 900Â°C in yet another embodiment, and from 400Â°C to 850Â°C in yet a more particular embodiment, and from 800Â°C to 900Â°C in yet a more particular embodiment, and from 810Â°C to 890Â°C in yet a more particular embodiment, wherein a desirable range comprises any combination of any upper temperature limit with any lower temperature limit. CalC1ning may take place in the absence of oxygen and moisture by using, for example, an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Alternatively, calC1ning may take place in the presence of moisture and air.<br>
[0070]	The support, espeC1ally an inorganic support or graphite support, may be<br>
pretreated such as by a halogenation process or other suitable process that, for example, assoC1ates a chemical speC1es with the support either through chemical bonding, ionic interactions, or other physical or chemical interaction. In one embodiment, the support is fiuorided. The fluorine compounds suitable for providing fluorine for the support are desirably inorganic fluorine containing compounds. Such inorganic fluorine containing compounds may be any compound containing a fluorine atom as long as it does not contain a carbon atom. Particularly desirable are inorganic fluorine containing compounds selected from the group consisting of NHUBF^ (NH^SiFe, NHTO, NHjF, (NH^TaF?, NH4NbF4, (NH4)2GeF6, (NH4)2SmF6, (NH4)2TiF6, (NH^ZrFe, MoF6, ReF6, GaF3, SO2C1F, F2, SiF4, SF6, C1F3, C1F5, BrF5, IF7, NF3, HF, BF3, NHF2 and NH4HF2.<br>
[0071]	A desirable method of treating the support with the fluorine compound is to dry<br>
mix the two components by simply blending at a concentration of from 0.01 to 10.0 millimole F/g of support in one embodiment, and in the range of from 0.05 to 6.0 millimole F/g of support in another embodiment, and in the range of from 0.1 to 3.0 millimole F/g of support in yet another embodiment. The fluorine compound can be dry mixed with the support either before or after charging to the vessel for dehydration or calC1ning the support. Accordingly, the<br><br>
fluorine concentration present on the support is in the range of from 0.2 to 5 wt% in one embodiment, and from 0.6 to 3.5 wt% of support in another embodiment.<br>
[0072]	Another method of treating the support with the fluorine compound is to<br>
dissolve the fluorine in a solvent, such as water, and then contact the support with the fluorine containing solution (at the concentration ranges described herein). When water is used and silica is the support, it is desirable to use a C1uantity of water that is less than the total pore volume of the support. Desirably, the support and, for example, fluorine compounds are contacted by any suitable means such as by dry mixing or slurry mixing at a temperature of from 100Â°C to 1000Â°C in one embodiment, and from 200Â°C to 800Â°C in another embodiment, and from 300Â°C to 600Â°C in yet another embodiment, the contacting in any case taking place for between two to eight hours.<br>
[0073]	It is within the scope of the present invention to co-contact (or "co-immobilize")<br>
more than one catalyst component with a support. Non-limiting examples of co-immobilization of catalyst components include two or more of the same or different metallocene catalyst components, one or more metallocene with a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst, one or more metallocene with a chromium or "Phillips" type catalyst, one or more metallocenes with a Group 15 containing catalyst (metal amido catalyst), and any of these combinations with one or more activators. More particularly, co-supported combinations include metallocene A/metallocene A; metallocene A/metallocene B; metallocene/Ziegler Natta; metallocene/Group 15 containing catalyst; metallocene/chromium catalyst; metallocene/Ziegler Natta/Group 15 containing catalyst; metallocene/chromium catalyst/Group 15 containing catalyst, any of the these with an activator, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0074]	Further,  the  catalyst  system  of the  present  invention  can  include  any<br>
combination of activators and catalyst components, either supported or not supported, in any number of ways. For example, the catalyst component may include any one or both of metallocenes and/or Group 15 containing catalysts components, and may include any combination of activators, any of which may be supported by any number of supports as described herein. Non-limiting examples of catalyst system combinations useful in the present invention include MN + NCA; MN:S + NCA; NCA:S + MN; MN:NCA:S; MN + A1A; MN:S + A1A; A1A:S + MN; MN:A1A:S; A1A:S + NCA + MN; NCA:S + MN + A1A; G15 + NCA;<br><br>
G15:S + NCA; NCA:S + G15; G15:NCA:S; G15 + ALA; G15:S + ALA; A1A:S + G15; G15:A1A:S; A1A:S + NCA + G15; NCA:S + G15 + A1A; MN + NCA + G15; MN:S + NCA + G15; NCA:S + MN + G15; MN:NCA:S + G15; MN + G15 + A1A; MN:S + AIA + G15; A1A:S + MN + G15; MN:A1A:S + G15; A1A:S + NCA + MN + G15; NCA:S + MN + ALA + G15; MN + NCA; G15:MN:S + NCA; G15:NCA:S + MN; G15:MN:NCA:S; G15:MN:S + AIA; G15:A1A:S + MN; G15:MN:A1A:S; G15:ALA:S + NCA + MN; G15:NCA:S + MN + AIA; wherein "MN" is metallocene component, "NCA" is a non-coordinating activator including ionic and neutral boron and aluminum based compounds as described above, "AIA" is an aluminum alkyl and/or alumoxane based activator, "G15" is a Group 15 containing catalyst component (or metal amido catalyst) as described above, and "S" is a support; and wherein the use of ":" with "S" means that that those groups next to the colon are assoC1ated with ("supported by") the support as by pretreatment and other techniC1ues known in the art, and the "+" sign means that the additional component is not directly bound to the support but present with the support and speC1es bound to the support, such as present in a slurry, solution, gas phase, or another way, but is not meant to be limited to speC1es that have no physico-chemical interaction with the support and/or supported speC1es. Thus, for example, the embodiment "MN:NCA:S + G15" means that a metallocene and NCA activator are bound to a support, and present in, for example, a gas phase polymerization with a Group 15 containing catalyst component.<br>
3.4      The activator<br>
[0075]	As used herein, the term "activator" is defined to be any compound or<br>
combination of compounds, supported or unsupported, which can activate a single-site catalyst compound (e.g., metallocenes, metal amido catalysts, etc.), such as by creating a cationic speC1es from the catalyst component. Typically, this involves the abstraction of at least one leaving group (X group in the formulas/structures above) from the metal center of the catalyst component. The catalyst components of the present invention are thus activated towards olefin polymerization using such activators. Embodiments of such activators include Lewis aC1ds such as cyclic or oligomeric poly(hydrocarbylaluminum oxides) and so called non-coordinating activators ("NCA") (alternately, "ionizing activators" or "stoichiometric activators"), or any other compound that can convert a neutral metallocene catalyst component to a metallocene cation that is active with respect to olefin polymerization.<br><br>
 [0076]	More particularly, it is within the scope of this invention to use Lewis aC1ds such<br>
as alumoxane (e.g., "MAO"), modified alumoxane (e.g., "TIBAO" or "MMAO"), and alkylaluminurn compounds as activators, and/or ionizing activators (neutral or ionic) such as tri (n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron and/or a trisperfluorophenyl boron metalloid precursors to activate desirable metallocenes described herein. MAO and other aluminum-based activators are well known in the art. Ionizing activators are well known in the art and are described by, for example, Eugene You-Xian Chen &amp; Tobin J. Marks, Cocatalysts for Metal-Catalyzed Olefin Polymerization: Activators, Activation Processes, and Structure-Activity Relationships 100(4) CHEMICAL REVIEWS 1391-1434 (2000). The activators may be assoC1ated with or bound to a support, either in assoC1ation with the catalyst component (e.g., metallocene) or separate from the catalyst component, such as described by Gregory G. Hlatky, Heterogeneous Single-Site Catalysts for Olefin Polymerization 100(4) CHEMICAL REVIEWS 1347-1374 (2000).<br>

 [0079]	Examples  of neutral ionizing activators  include  Group  13 tri-substituted<br>
compounds, in particular, tri-substituted boron, tellurium, aluminum, gallium and indium compounds, and mixtures thereof. The three substituent groups are each independently selected from alkyls, alkenyls, halogen, substituted alkyls, aryls, arylhalides, alkoxy and halides. In one embodiment, the three groups are independently selected from halogen, mono or multicyclic (including halosubstituted) aryls, alkyls, and alkenyl compounds and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the three groups are selected from alkenyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aryl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms (including substituted aryls), and combinations thereof.

By "highly halogenated", it is meant that at least 50% of the hydrogens are replaced by a halogen group selected from fluorine, chlorine and bromine. In yet another embodiment, the neutral stoichiometric activator is a tri-substituted Group 13 compound comprising highly fluorided aryl groups, the groups being highly fluorided phenyl and highly fluorided naphthyl groups.<br>

4.0      Method of polymerization<br>
[0088]	The polymerization process of the present invention may be carried out using<br>
any suitable process, for example, solution, slurry and gas phase. A particularly useful method for produC1ng polyolefm polymers according to the present invention is a gas phase polymerization process preferably utilizing a single fluidized bed reactor in a single stage process. This type reactor and means for operating the reactor are well known and completely described in, for example, US 3,709,853; 4,003,712; 4,011,382; 4,302,566; 4,543,399; 4,882,400; 5,352,749; 5,541,270; EP-A- 0 802 202 and Belgian Patent No. 839,380. These patents disclose gas phase polymerization processes wherein the polymerization medium is either mechanically agitated or fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent.<br>
[0089]	In one embodiment, the polymerization process of the present invention may be<br>
effected as a continuous gas phase process such as a fluid bed process. A fluid bed reactor for use in the process of the present invention typically comprises a reaction zone and a so-called veloC1ty reduction zone. The reaction zone comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer and diluent to remove heat of polymerization through the reaction zone. Optionally, some of the re-C1rculated gases may be cooled and compressed to form liC1uids that increase the heat removal capaC1ty of the C1rculating gas stream when readmitted to the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by simple experiment. Make up of gaseous monomer to the C1rculating gas stream is at a rate eC1ual to the rate at which particulate polymer product and monomer assoC1ated therewith is withdrawn from the reactor and the composition of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. The gas leaving the reaction zone is passed to the veloC1ty reduction zone where entrained particles are removed. Finer entrained particles and dust may be removed in a cyclone and/or fine filter. The gas is passed through a recycle line and then through a heat exchanger wherein the heat of polymerization is removed, compressed in a compressor and then returned to the reaction zone. The control agents of the present invention may be added to any part of the reactor system as described herein, and in a particular embodiment are introduced into the recycle line, and in even a more particular embodiment, introduced into the recycle line upstream of the heat exchanger.<br><br>
 [0090]	The reactor temperature of the fluidized bed process herein ranges from 30Â°C or<br>
40Â°C or 50Â°C to 90Â°C or 100Â°C or 110Â°C or 120Â°C or 150Â°C5 wherein a desirable temperature range comprises any upper temperature limit combined with any lower temperature limit described herein. In general, the reactor temperature is operated at the highest temperature that is feasible taking into account the sintering temperature of the polymer product within the reactor. Regardless of the process used to make the polyolefins of the invention, the polymerization temperature, or reaction temperature should be below the melting or "sintering" temperature of the polymer to be formed. Thus, the upper temperature limit in one embodiment is the melting temperature of the polyolefin produced in the reactor.<br>
[0091]	The gas phase reactor pressure, wherein gases may comprise hydrogen, ethylene<br>
i<br>
and higher comonomers, and other gases, is between 1 (101 kPa) and 100 atm (10,132 kPa) in one embodiment, and between 5 (506 kPa) and 50 atm (5066 kPa) in another embodiment, and between 10(1013 kPa) and 40 atm (4050 kPa) in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0092]	The gas phase reactor employing the catalyst system described herein is capable<br>
of produC1ng from 500 Ibs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to 200,000 Ibs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr), and greater than 1000 Ibs/hr (455 Kg/hr) in another embodiment, and greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4540 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater than 35,000 Ibs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater than 50,000 Ibs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and from 65,000 Ibs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0093]	In another embodiment of the invention, the polymerization is effected by a<br>
slurry polymerization process. A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from 1 to 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0Â°C to 120Â°C, and more particularly from 30Â°C to 100Â°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed hi a liC1uid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liC1uid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane<br><br>
having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, a branched alkane in one embodiment. The medium employed should be liC1uid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. In one embodiment, a hexane, isopentane or isobutane medium is employed. In this embodiment of the polymerization process, the control agent may be introduced into the liC1uid medium, either directly into the reactor or in a recycle line.<br>
[0094]	Another desirable polymerization techniC1ue of the invention is referred to as a<br>
particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in US 4,613,484 and 2 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 322-332 (2000).<br>
[0095]	The process  of the present invention is  suitable  for the production of<br>
homopolymers of olefins, particularly ethylene, and/or copolymers, terpolymers, and the like, of olefins, particularly ethylene, and at least one or more other olefin(s). Preferably the olefins are a-olefins. The olefins, for example, may contain from 2 to 16 carbon atoms in one embodiment; and in another embodiment, ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in another embodiment; and ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 3 or 4 to 10 carbon atoms in yet another embodiment; and ethylene and a comonomer comprising from 4 to 8 carbon atoms in yet another embodiment. Particularly preferred for preparation herein by the process of the present invention are polyethylenes. Such polyethylenes are homopolymers of ethylene and interpolymers of ethylene and at least one a-olefin wherein the ethylene content is at least about 50% by weight of the total monomers involved in one embodiment. Exemplary olefins that may be utilized herein are ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 4-methylpent-l-ene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-hexadecene and the like. Also utilizable herein are polyenes such as 1,3-hexadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 4-vinylcyclohex-l-ene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and olefins formed in situ in the polymerization medium. When olefins are formed in situ in the polymerization medium, the formation of polyolefins containing long chain branching may occur.<br><br>
 [0096]	In the production of polyethylene or polypropylene, comonomers may be<br>
present in the polymerization reactor. When present, the comonomer may be present at any level with the ethylene or propylene monomer that will achieve the desired weight percent incorporation of the comonomer into the finished resin. In one embodiment of polyethylene production, the comonomer is present with ethylene in a mole ratio range of from 0.0001 (comonomenethylene) to 50, and from 0.0001 to 5 in another embodiment, and from 0.0005 to 1.0 in yet another embodiment, and from 0.001 to 0.5 in yet another embodiment. Expressed another way, the mole percent of primary monomer, ethylene in one embodiment, in the reactor ranges from 5 to 95 mole% in one embodiment, and from 10 to 85 mole% in another embodiment, and from 20 to 80 mole% in yet another embodiment, and from 40 to 75 mole% in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0097]	In conjunction with the control agent, hydrogen gas is used in processes of the<br>
present invention to control the final properties of the polymer composition, such as described in POLYPROPYLENE HANDBOOK 76-78 (Hanser Publishers, 1996). The amount of hydrogen used in the polymerization process of the present invention is an amount necessary to achieve the desired FI or MI of the final polyolefin resin. In one embodiment, the mole ratio of hydrogen to total primary monomer (Bbrprimary monomer) is in a range of from 0.0001 or 0.001 or 0.002 or 0.003 to 0.012 or 0.014 or 0.018 or 0.024, wherein a desirable range may comprise any combination of any upper mole ratio limit with any lower mole ratio limit described herein, and wherein in a particular embodiment the "primary monomer" is ethylene. Expressed another way, the amount of hydrogen in the reactor at any time may range from 1000 ppm to 20,000 ppm in one embodiment, and from 2000 to 10,000 in another embodiment, and from 3000 to 8,000 in yet another embodiment, and from 4000 to 7000 in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may comprise any upper hydrogen limit with any lower hydrogen limit described herein.<br>
[0098]	A particular embodiment of the polymerization process of the invention is<br>
carried out in a single stage process using a single polymerization reactor. However, it is contemplated that the present invention would be useful in a stages process employing two or more reactors in series, wherein one reactor may produce, for example, a high molecular weight polymer and another reactor may produce a low molecular weight polymer. Such<br><br>
commerC1al polymerization systems are described in, for example, 2 METALLOCENE-BASED POLYOLEFINS 366-378 (John Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky, eds. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000); US 5,665,818, US 5,677,375; US 6,472,484; EP 0 517 868 and EP-A-0 794 200.<br>
[0100]	The bimetallic catalyst composition may be introduced into the polymerization<br>
reactor by any suitable means regardless of the type of polymerization reactor used. In one embodiment, the bimetallic catalyst composition is feed to the reactor in a substantially dry state, meaning that the isolated solid form of the catalyst has not been diluted or combined with a diluent prior to entering the reactor. In another embodiment, the catalyst composition is combined with a diluent and feed to the reactor; the diluent in one embodiment is an alkane such as a â¬4 to Cao alkane, toluene, xylene, mineral or silicon oil, or combinations thereof, such as described in, for example, US 5,290,745.<br>
[0101]	The bimetallic catalyst composition may be combined with up to 2.5 wt% of a<br>
metal-fatty aC1d compound in one embodiment, such as, for example, an aluminum stearate, based upon the weight of the catalyst system (or its components), such as disclosed in US 6,300,436 and 5,283,278. Other suitable metals useful in combination with the fatty aC1d include other Group 2 and Group 5-13 metals. In an alternate embodiment, a solution of the metal-fatty aC1d compound is fed into the reactor. In yet another embodiment, the metal-fatty aC1d compound is mixed with the catalyst and fed into the reactor separately. These agents may be mixed with the catalyst or may be fed into the reactor in a solution or a slurry with or without the catalyst system or its components.<br>
[0102]	In another embodiment, the supported catalyst(s) are combined with the<br>
activators and are combined, such as by tumbling and other suitable means, with up to 2.5 wt% (by weight of the catalyst composition) of an antistatic agent, such as an ethoxylated or methoxylated amine, an example of which is Kemamine AS-990 (IC1 SpeC1alties, Bloomington Delaware).<br>

[0103]	The polymer compositions produced by the methods described herein, are<br>
bimodal in one embodiment. The term "bimodal," when used to describe a polyolefin, for example, polypropylene or polyethylene, or other homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers,<br><br>
means "bimodal molecular weight distribution," which term is understood as having the broadest definition persons in the pertinent art have given that term as reflected in printed publications and issued patents. For example, a single polymer composition that includes polyolefins with at least one identifiable high molecular weight distribution and polyolefms with at least one identifiable low molecular weight distribution is considered to be a "bimodal" polyolefm, as that term is used herein. Those high and low molecular weight polymers may be identified by deconvolution techniC1ues known in the art to discern the two polymers from a broad or shouldered GPC curve of the bimodal polyolefins of the invention, and in another embodiment, the GPC curve of the bimodal polymers of the invention may display distinct peaks with a trough.

invention. Such salts may be present from 0.001 to 2 wt% of the composition in one embodiment, and from 0.01 to 1 wt% in another embodiment.

[0117]	With respect to the physical process of produC1ng the blend of polyolefin and<br>
one or more additives, suffiC1ent mixing should take place to assure that a uniform blend will be produced prior to conversion into a finished product. The polyolefin suitable for use in the present invention can be in any physical form when used to blend with the one or more additives. In one embodiment, reactor granules, defined as the granules of polymer that are<br><br>
isolated from the polymerization reactor, are used to blend with the additives. The reactor granules have an average diameter of from 10 um to 5 mm, and from 50 um to 10 mm in another embodiment. Alternately, the polyolefin is in the form of pellets, such as, for example, having an average diameter of from 1 mm to 6 mm that are formed from melt extrusion of the reactor granules.<br>
[0118]	One method of blending the additives with the polyolefin is to contact the<br>
components in a tumbler or other physical blending means, the polyolefin being in the form of reactor granules. This can then be followed, if desired, by melt blending in an extruder. Another method of blending the components is to melt blend the polyolefin pellets with the additives directly in an extruder, Brabender or any other melt blending means.<br>
[0119]	The resultant polyolefin and polyolefin compositions of the present invention<br>
may be further processed by any suitable means such as by calendering, casting, coating, compounding, extrusion, foaming; all forms of molding including compression molding, injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding, and transfer molding; film blowing or casting and all methods of film formation to achieve, for example, uniaxial or biaxial orientation; thermoforming, as well as by lamination, pultrusion, protrusion, draw reduction, spinbonding, melt spinning, melt blowing, and other forms of fiber and nonwoven fabric formation, and combinations thereof. These and other forms of suitable processing techniC1ues are described in, for example, PLASTICS PROCESSING (Radian Corporation, Noyes Data Corp. 1986).<br>
[0120]	The polymer compositions of the present invention may also be blended with<br>
other polymers. In a particular embodiment, the polymer compositions described herein are blended with high pressure polymerized low density polyethylene, or with linear low density polyethylene in another embodiment, or with other polymers or elastomers, non-limiting examples of which include polypropylene, ethylene-propylene rubber, butyl rubber, high density polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyamides, and polystyrenes.<br>
[0121]	In the case of injection molding of various articles, simple solid state blends of<br>
the pellets serve eC1ually as well as pelletized melt state blends of raw polymer granules, of granules with pellets, or of pellets of the two components since the forming process includes a<br><br>
remelting and mixing of the raw material. In the process of compression molding of medical devices, however, little mixing of the melt components occurs, and a pelletized melt blend would be preferred over simple solid state blends of the constituent pellets and/or granules. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine the appropriate procedure for blending of the polymers to balance the need for intimate mixing of the component ingredients with the desire for process economy.<br>

[0125]	Thus, the compositions of the present invention can be described alternately by<br>
any of the embodiments disclosed herein, or a combination of any of the embodiments<br>
/<br>
described herein. Embodiments of the invention, while not meant to be limiting by, may be better understood by reference to the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0126]	The following examples relate to gas phase polymerization procedures carried<br>
out in a fluidized bed reactor, utilizing ethylene and either a hexene or butene comonomer, resulting in production of polyethylene. The tables identify each run, along with the reported reaction conditions for each run. Various properties of the resulting product are also identified.<br>
[0127]	The fluidized bed of each reactor was made up of polymer granules.  During<br>
each run, the gaseous feed streams of ethylene and hydrogen were introduced before the reactor bed into a recycle gas line. The injections were downstream of the recycle line heat exchanger and compressor. LiC1uid hexene or butene comonomer was introduced before the reactor bed. The control agent, if any, that influenced resin split was added before the reactor bed into a recycle gas line in gaseous or liC1uid form. The individual flows of ethylene, hydrogen and hexene comonomer were controlled to maintain target reactor conditions, as identified in each example. The concentrations of gases were measured by an on-line chromatograph.<br>
[0128]	In each run, supported bimetallic catalyst was injected directly into the fluidized<br>
bed using purified nitrogen. Catalyst injection rates were adjusted to maintain approximately constant production rate. In each run, the catalyst used was made with silica dehydrated at 875 Â°C, and metallocene compound CpiMXi wherein Cp is a n-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ring, M is Zirconium; and X is fluoride. The titanium source was TiCLj.<br><br>
 [0129]	An example of the method of making the bimetallic catalyst used in the<br>
Examples is as follows: silica support material, Davison SylopolÂ® 955 Silica is used. The silicas are dehydrated at a temperature of 875Â°C. Then, for each sample, a non-metallocene catalyst is combined with the dehydrated silica. That is, for each sample, 500 grams of the respective dehydrated silica is added into a 5-liter, 3-neck round bottom flask enclosed in an N2 glove box. Anhydrous hexane (2500 ml) is then added into the flask, making a silica/hexane slurry. The slurry is heated to a temperature of about 54Â°C while under constant stirring, and 380 grams of a 15 wt.% solution of dibutyl magnesium is added to the slurry over a period of about 20 minutes. The slurry is then allowed to stand for an additional 30 minutes. Butanol (27.4 grams) is diluted to volume with hexane in a 125 ml volumetric flask. The entire 125 ml of diluted butanol solution is added dropwise into the flask containing the slurry, and then the slurry is held at a temperature of about 54Â°C for 30 minutes while under constant agitation. The amount of butanol may be varied, depending upon the desired concentrations. Titanium tetrachloride (41.0 grams) is diluted to volume with hexane. in a 125 ml volumetric flask. The entire 125 ml of diluted titanium tetrachloride solution is then added dropwise into the flask containing the slurry. Following the addition of the solution, the slurry is allowed to stand for about 30 minutes at a temperature of about 54Â°C. The slurry is then allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
[0130]	The metallocene catalyst compound is then added to the sample of titanium<br>
tetrachloride-treated dehydrated silica. First, 673 grams of a 30 wt.% solution of methylaluminoxane (MAO) in toluene is added to a new flask in an N2 glove box. About 13.72 grams of the metallocene bis-n-butyl-cyclopentadienyl zirconium difluoride is added into the MAO solution, and the mixture is stirred until all of the solids are dissolved. Next, the MAO/Metallocene mixture is slowly added into the flask containing the previously prepared titanium reaction slurry over a period of about one hour. Toluene (50 ml) is used to wash the residual MAO/Metallocene mixture remaining in the flask into the flask containing the reaction slurry. The Al/Zr molar ratio (Al from MAO) may range from about 90 to 110; The Ti/Zr molar ratio is about 6. Each resulting mixture that included the respective bimetallic catalyst sample is then held at ambient temperature for a period of one hour. Afterward, each mixture is dried using a rotary vaporizer, followed by removing most of the hexanes using a vacuum pressure of 21 mmHg at a temperature of 52Â°C. The high boiling point toluene was subseC1uently removed using a vacuum pressure of 28 mmHg at a temperature of 70Â°C. The<br><br>
final dried bimetallic catalyst appears brown in color as a free flowing solid. Each sample is used in a separate polymerization run in a gas phase reactor, under the conditions identified hi the Tables to form a polyethylene polymer composition. This example procedure is capable of being scaled-up by 250 to 1000 times these amounts listed.<br>
[0131]	During each run, the reacting bed of growing polymer particles was maintained<br>
in a fluidized state by a continuous flow of the make-up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. As indicated in the tables, each run utilized a target reactor temperatures ("Bed Temperature"), namely, a reactor temperature of about 203 Â°F or 95 Â°C. During each run, reactor temperature was maintained at an approximately constant level by adjusting up or down the temperature of the recycle gas to accommodate any changes in the rate of heat generation due to the polymerization.<br>
[0132]	Example 1.    Table 1 shows a comparison between polyethylene production<br>
with and without feed of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). These runs took place seC1uentially on the same reactor. Runs number 1 and 2 were done using no IPA. Runs 3 and 4 included IPA feed and had much higher resin Flow Index and low-molecular-weight (LMW) polymer fraction. Figure 1 shows the comparison between run 2 and 3, confirming presence of much more LMW polymer with IPA feed. Figure 2 shows the comparison between run 2 and 4, again confirming presence of much more LMW polymer with IPA feed. Densities were determined as per ASTM D-105. The Mw/Mn, Mz/Mw, the Mw (weight average molecular weight) and Mn (number average molecular weight) values are as determined by gel permeation chromatography using crosslinked polystyrene columns; pore size seC1uence: 1 column less than 1000 A, 3 columns of mixed 5x10(7) A; 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solvent at 140Â°C with refractive index detection. Other test methods are as C1ted above.<br>
[0133]	The GPC data is deconvolved into high and low molecular weight components<br>
by use of a "Wesslau model", wherein the Beta term is restrained for the low molecular weight peak to 1.4, as described by E. Broyer &amp; R.F. Abbott, Analysis of molecular weight distribution using multicomponent models, ACS SYMP. SER. (1982), 197 (COMPUT. APPL. APPL. POLYM. SC1.), 45-64.<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0134]	Example 2.    This comparative example shows the effect of oxygen feed to the<br>
recycle gas line of a different reactor than used for Example 1. Oxygen increases the amount (%) low-molecular-weight and increases polymer composition FI. In Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 3, the amount of oxygen is referenced in terms of ppmv. In the instance of oxygen, wt ppm is essentially eC1uivalent to wt ppm.<br>
[0135]	Table 2 shows test runs that took place seC1uentially on the same reactor.   Run<br>
number 5 used no oxygen feed, while run number 6 used oxygen feed eC1uivalent to 5 mole ppm based on ethylene feed rate. Resin FI changed from 11.68 dg/min hi run number 5 to 68.17 dg/min in run number 6. This happened even though water feed rate decreased from 18.9 to 13.9 comparing run number 5 to run number 6. A decrease in water feed rate would normally reduce resin FI (see, for example, US 5,525,678), but instead this example shows a major increase in FI with the oxygen feed.<br>
[0136]	The use of oxygen increased resin FI and also reduced catalyst productivity.<br>
Table 3 shows approximate distribution of the reduction in productivity between LMW and HMW portions of the catalyst. We find that oxygen preferentially kills (deactivates) the high-MW portion of the bimetallic catalyst, thereby reduC1ng production of HMW resin. This is significantly benefiC1al since the HMW polymer foulant produced in stagnant portions of the reactor is sometimes released into the fluidized bed. If the foulant is rich in HMW resin, then gels are often found in the polymer product, which reduces its potential to produce valuable products. The use of oxygen feed to the recycle gas system will result in foulant, if any, being rich in LMW polymer and this foulant having little tendency to cause gels in the final polymer product.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0137]	In one embodiment of the invention, the presence of from 1 to 50 ppm, based on<br>
the feed rate of the primary monomer, ethylene in a particular embodiment, results in a reduction in the catalyst productivity for the first catalyst component of from 0 to 20 % in one embodiment, and from 2 to 15 % hi another embodiment; and a reduction in the catalyst productivity for the second catalyst component of from 20 to 90 % in one embodiment, and from 30 to 80 % in another embodiment, and from 40 to 75 % in yet another embodiment. In a particular embodiment, these results are achieved when the first catalyst component of the bimetallic catalyst composition is a fiuorided metallocene, and the second catalyst component is a magnesium-titanium based Ziegler-Natta catalyst component, and the two are supported on an inorganic oxide support and injected by any suitable means into the fiuidized bed of a gas phase fiuidized bed reactor.<br>
[0138]	One advantage of the present invention is that the relative level of the HMW and<br>
LMW polymers can be controlled, and in particular, that the rheological properties of the resultant polymer composition can be controlled. Another advantage of the present invention is the reduction of gels (spots of discontinuity wherein a portion of the polymer is immisC1ble in the surrounding bulk polymer) in the polymer compositions produced herein, and further in the films and other articles produced from the polymer compositions. Another advantage is that the use of the control agents of the present invention also have been shown to reduce reactor fouling in gas phase reactors, thus increasing the utility of such a process as C121med herein. Yet another advantage of the present invention is the ease of transition hi the reactor from the bimetallic catalyst composition to, for example, a chromium catalyst which is known to be sensitive to alcohols and ether agents. Such a transition in the reactor from the bimetallic catalyst composition comprising a metallocene/Ziegler-Natta composition to a chromium oxide<br>
type catalyst was made without reduction in the expected activity and productivity of the chromium catalyst.<br>
[0139]	Yet another advantage of the present invention is the maintenance of a useful<br>
catalyst activity (productivity) when using from 0.1 to 50 ppm of the control agent. In one embodiment, the total bimetallic catalyst productivity decreases by less than 60 %, and by less than 50 % in another embodiment, and by less than 40% hi a more particular embodiment, and by less than 30 % in yet a more particular embodiment, and by less than 20 % in yet a more particular embodiment. While some ether/alcohol compounds have been disclosed to deactivate Ziegler-type catalysts, such as in US 5,200,502, and to deactivate metallocene catalysts, such as in EP 0 630 910, it is unexpected that these compounds can be used to selectively adjust the activity/productivity of bimetallic catalyst compositions as shown herein, while advantageously maintaining a useful overall catalyst activity/productivity for the bimetallic catalyst composition.<br>
[0140]	The polymer composition may be processed by any techniC1ue common in the art<br>
to produce a variety of products; processing techniC1ues include injection molding, blow molding, roto-molding or formed into a sheet or tubing; wherein the polymer composition used to make these products may first be extruded and pelleted by techniC1ues common in the art and blended with any combination of additives such as processing aids and antioxidants.<br>
[0141]	One embodiment of the method of produC1ng a polymer composition is as<br>
follows. For a given polymerization run, a choice is made by the resin manufacturer to produce a polymer composition which possesses a desirable "target I21 value", such as, for example, a range of from 5 to 15 dg/min for a composition to be made into certain desirable end products such as films, and a range of from 22 to 38 dg/min for a polymer composition to used in blow molding applications. The target In value is typically a range of values in practice, such as a range of+/- 2 to +/-10 dg/min about any value of from 3 to 100 or 200 dg/min, depending on the desired target value and the desired level of fluctuation in the actual target value in various batches of the polymer composition coming off the reactor.<br>
[0142]	Having determined a target I21, the method of the invention further entails the<br>
incorporation of a high molecular weight polymer into a low molecular weight polymer to form the polymer composition in a single gas phase polymerization reactor in the presence of<br>
polymerizable monomers, a bimetallic catalyst composition and at least one control agent. In a particular embodiment, the "incorporation" of the two polymer components is an in situ process taking place in one polymerization reactor, in one stage from the time polymerizable monomers are contacted in the reactor bed with catalyst, to the time that the polymer composition is drawn from the reactor bed for further processes (e.g., blending, pelleting, etc). The control agent can be any agent as disclosed herein, and is chosen to best suit the needs of the given polymerization conditions and end product that is desired. For example, it may be determined before the polymerization run that a certain control agent or blend of control agents influences in the most desirable manner the given catalyst components of the bimetallic catalyst composition being used.<br>
[0143]	The control agent, either as a liC1uid, nebulized solid, solution, or other form, is<br>
added to the reactor, preferably injected in the recycle line, in an amount suffiC1ent to control the weight average molecular weight of the high molecular weight polymer, the level of low molecular weight polymer, or both. Stated another way, the control agent is chosen and added such that it alters, either by increasing or decreasing, the polymerization activity of one or both of the catalyst components of the bimetallic catalyst composition.<br>
[0144]	Thus, in such a manner, the target fC1 can be maintained. The examples above<br>
i<br>
demonstrate the dynamic between the level and type of control agent used in the polymerization process using bimetallic catalyst compositions.<br>
