DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a recording apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 1, the recording apparatus includes a filter 1, a controller 2, and a recorder 3.<br>
The filter 1 extracts video data from an input bitstream.   The recorder 3 decodes the extracted video data, encodes the decoded video data in different way to original way, and records the encoded video data in an information storage medium, i.e., a disc 100.    The controller 2 generates and transmits video transform information, which is to be referred to for decoding the video data into an original state, to the recorder 3.<br>
For example, when a bitstream is a digital broadcast stream which is transmitted from a digital TV broadcast station, the filter 1 filters information packets containing program information data for reproduction and recording.   In addition, the filter 1 filters data packets of a selected program.<br>
A digital broadcast stream is a sequence of the data packets of a broadcast program and information packets.   An information packet is divided into two types. One is a first information packet indicating the identifiers of packets in which the identifiers of data packets of at least one broadcast program are recorded, and the other is a second information packet indicating the identifiers of data packets of the broadcast program.    In other words, the identifier of the second information packet is recorded in the first information packet, and the identifiers of data packets of a broadcasting program are recorded in the second information packet.    When a multiple-channel is supported, there are as many second information packets as the number of channels.    Each information packet may be physically composed of a plurality of packets.<br>
In the case where a digital broadcast stream is an MPEG transmission (TS) stream, information packets containing program information data for reproduction and recording are a program association table (PAT) packet and a program map table (PMT) packet.    The PAT packet is the first information packet, and the PMT packet is the second information packet.    A data packet is a video packet, an audio packet, and/or a hypertext data packet.<br>
FIG. 2 is an embodiment of FIG. 1.    Referring to FIG. 2, a recording apparatus for receiving an MPEG TS stream and re-encoding it in different way to original way includes a demultiplexer (DEMUX) 50, a video decoder 51, a video encoder 53, a filter 55, a program specific information (PSI) generator 56, and a multiplexer (MUX) 57.    In addition, the recording apparatus may further include an audio decoder 52 and an audio encoder 54.<br>
The DEMUX 50 receives an MPEG TS stream and separates it into a video data (and audio data), a hypertext data, and program information data.    More specifically, the MPEG TS stream is separated into a video packetized element stream (PES), an audio PES, and a hypertext data and program information data and input to the video decoder 51, the audio decoder 52, and the filter 55, respectively.   The video decoder 51 decodes the video PES, and the video encoder 53 encodes the decoded video PES in different way.    The encoding in different way<br>
comprehends a compression method, reduction or expansion of the size of data and so on.   The audio decoder 52 decodes the audio PES, and the audio encoder 54 encodes the decoded audio PES in different way.   When the audio decoder 52 and the audio encoder 54 are not provided, the audio PES is directly input to the MUX 57.<br>
The filter 55 filters the hypertext data and necessary program information data. More specifically, the filter 55 filters necessary packets among PAT packets and PMT packets which are contained in the MPEG TS stream and periodically transmitted. Program information data necessary for recording, reproducing, and searching a program composed of the MPEG TS stream is recorded in the PAT packets and PMT packets.   The PSI generator 56 generates PSI describing the program.    The data structure of the PSI is defined in MPEG system standards.    In addition, the PSI generator 56 extracts the vertical and horizontal resolutions and aspect ratio of the video data output from the. video decoder 51, embeds them into a PMT packet as video transform information, and transmits the resulting PMT packet to the MUX 57.   The vertical and horizontal resolutions and aspect ratio of the video data are recorded in the header of the video data.    The MUX 57 multiplexes the input video data, audio data, hypertext data, and PMT packet containing the video transform information and outputs a multiplexed data stream.    The multiplexed data stream is recorded in a program area of a disc 200.<br>
Alternatively, instead of multiplexing the PMT packet with video data, audio data, and hypertext data, the MUX 57 may transmit the PMT packet as it is so that the PMT packet is recorded only in a program information data area of the disc 200. The PMT packet can be recorded in the form of a PMT in which PMT configuration information is recorded.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 are diagrams for explaining an MPEG TS stream.   Referring to FIG. 3, video packets 31, 33, 34, and 37 and audio packets 32, 35, and 36 are multiplexed into an input MPEG TS stream 300.    Once the MPEG TS stream 300 is received, the video packets 31, 33, 34, and 37 and the audio packets 32, 35, and 36 are separated and recombined into a video stream 302 and an audio stream 301.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, each of MPEG TS packets 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 constituting an MPEG TS stream 400 is assigned with a packet identifier.    Similarly, once the MPEG TS stream 400 is received, the packets are separated during decoding, and packets having the same identifiers are combined into a single file. In other words, as shown in FIG. 4, packets having a packet identifier 1 are combined into a stream 401, and packets having a packet identifier 2 are combined into a stream 401.   A PAT packet is assigned with a particular packet identifier.    In FIG. 4, a packet having a packet identifier 0 is a PAT packet.    The identifiers of as many PMT packets as the number of supported channels are recorded in the PAT packet.    For simplicity, the PAT packet is expressed as a single packet, but as described above, the PAT packet can be composed of a plurality of packets.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram for explaining an information storage medium in which an MPEG broadcast program is recorded by a recording apparatus according to the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 5, the data recording area of the information storage medium is divided into a navigation data area in which navigation data is recorded and a program area in which programs #1, #2, ..., #n are recorded.   A program is composed of a bitstream into which video data (and audio data) and hypertext data are multiplexed.    Each of the programs #1, #2, ..., #n is a logical unit of content recorded in the information storage medium.    The navigation data is information necessary for recording, reproducing, or editing a program and general information described in the program.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B are diagrams of the data structures of video transform information which is recorded according to embodiments of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6A, a PMT containing PMT configuration information is recorded in a navigation data area.    Referring to FIG. 6B, a PMT packet containing PMT configuration information is embedded into a bitstream and recorded in a program data area.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram of the data structure of a navigation data according to an embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 7, the navigation data includes a volume manager table.    The volume manager table contains<br>
management information for a plurality of programs recorded in an information storage medium.   The volume manager table includes volume general information VOL_GI about the information storage medium, a program search pointer table PG_SRPT indicating the position of program information, and a program information table PG_lT # about each program.<br>
VOL_GI contains the number of all programs recorded in the information storage medium, PG_Ns.    PG_SRPT indicates the offset value of a corresponding program information table from the start position of the volume manager table, PG_IT_SRP #.   There are as many offset values PG_IT_SRP # as the number of programs.<br>
The program information table PGJT contains information necessary for reproducing a program.    Fields composing the program information table PGJT will be sequentially described.    PAT_SA is a start address of a PAT and indicates the offset value of the PAT from the start position of the PG_lT.    PMT_SA is a start address of a PMT and indicates the offset value of the PMT from the start position of the PGJT.    TMAP_SA is a start address of a time map (TMAP) and indicates the offset value of a relevant PAT from the start position of the PGJT.    A PAT has the same structure as a program association table structure defined in MPEG-2 standards.    A PAT can be modified to have a structure in which PMT information recorded in a PMT packet only for a predetermined program can be referred to when it is recorded.    PMT configuration information contained in a PMT packet is recorded in a PMT.    In addition, video transform information according to the present invention is embedded into the PMT.    TMAP is a table which maps times to positions (addresses).    The structure of TMAP may be the same as that of a DVD-VR or DVD-Streamer.<br>
The video transform information contains a resolution and an aspect ratio. The resolution indicates the resolution of video data contained in a bitstream in an original state.   The aspect ratio indicates the aspect ratio .of a pixel and may indicate the aspect ratio of a display screen as occasion demands.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram of the data structure of a video transform information according to an embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 8, the video transform information is embedded into a PMT or PMT packet.   A video element descriptor according to MPEG specifications is defined in the PMT packet.   The video element descriptor is for recording, for example, information indicating which specifications among MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4 video data complies with.   A video transform descriptor which is video transform information according to the present invention is added to the video element descriptor.   The video transform descriptor indicates the resolution and aspect ratio of the video data before re-encoded.   The following is an example of the video transform descriptor contained in the video element descriptor.<br>
(Descriptor Removed)<br>
Here, "descriptor_tag" denotes the identifier of the video transform descriptor, "descriptorjength" denotes the data size of the video transform descriptor, "horizontal_size" denotes a horizontal resolution, "vertical_size" denotes a vertical resolution, and "aspect_ratio_information" denotes an aspect ratio.<br>
A PMT packet according to the MPEG specifications is defined as follows.<br>
(Descriptor Removed)<br>
Here, "stream_type == 0x02" indicates video data.    In other words, when "stream_type == 0x02", "descriptor()" is a video element descriptor describing the video data.   A video transform descriptor according to the present invention is embedded into a video element descriptor as follows.<br>
(Descriptor Removed)<br>
A recording method according to the present invention will be described on the basis of the above configuration.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a recording method according to a first embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 9, a recording apparatus generates video transform information for a received MPEG TS stream, embeds the video transform information into a PMT as PMT configuration information, and records the PMT in navigation data area which is separate from an area in which a program is recorded in step 901.    Here, the recording apparatus can record PMT configuration information in the form of a PMT packet instead of a PMT.    While a PMT takes less recording space, the PMT configuration information in the PMT must be rearranged into a PAT packet and a PMT packet before being transmitted to an MPEG decoder during reproduction.    When a PAT packet and a PMT packet are recorded, rearrangement is not necessary, but a recording space for the PAT packet and the PMT packet increases.    The recording apparatus extracts an MPEG TS packet of a program whose recording is requested by a user, encodes the video data of the MPEG TS packet in different way to original one, and records the encoded video data in a program area in step 902.    Whether to record a PAT packet and a PMT packet together with the recorded video data is optional.    Either of steps 901 and 902 can be performed prior to the other.   Alternatively, steps 901 and 902 can be simultaneously performed by a time division method.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart of a recording method according to a second embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 10, a recording apparatus<br>
input to the DEMUX 60.   The DEMUX 60 demultiplexes the bitstream into video data, audio data, hypertext data, and program information data.    The filter 65 filters the hypertext data and program information data to output necessary hypertext data and program information data only.   The PS I parser 66 parses video transform information from the program information data and transmits the video transform information to the video decoder 61.   The video decoder 61 decodes the video data according to original resolution and aspect ratio (video transform information) provided from the PSI parser 66 and provides the decoded video data to the blender 64.   The audio decoder 62 decodes the audio data and provides the decoded audio data to a sound output device.   The hypertext data decoder 63 decodes the hypertext data output from the filter 65 and provides the decoded hypertext data to the blender 64.   The blender 64 blends the video data with the hypertext data and outputs the result of blending.<br>
FIG. 13 shows another embodiment of FIG. 11.    Referring to FIG. 13, a reproducing apparatus includes a reader 4, a video transform information extractor 6, a remultiplexer (REMUX) 67, a DEMUX 60, a video decoder 61, an audio decoder 62, a filter 65, a PSI parser 66, a hypertext data decoder 63, and a blender 64. Particularly, in this embodiment, the PSI parser 66 is included in the decoder 5, and the video transform information extractor 6 is provided separately from the PSI parser 66.    In addition, unlike the reproducing apparatus of FIG. 12, the decoder 5 further includes the REMUX 67.<br>
The reader 4 reads a bitstream from a disc 400 which is an information storage medium and outputs it to the video transform information extractor 6 and/or the DEMUX 60.    Video data (and audio data) and hypertext data have been multiplexed in the bitstream.    In addition, the reader 4 reads video transform information, which has been recorded as PMT configuration information, from a navigation data area and outputs it to the video transform information extractor 6.<br>
The video transform information extractor 6 extracts the video transform information and provides it to the REMUX 67 and/or the video decoder 61.    The REMUX 67 multiplexes the bitstream and the video transform information to output a<br>
receives an MPEG TS stream into which video data and hypertext data are multiplexed and changes the resolution of video data when recording it.    In other words, the video decoder 51 decodes video data in step 1001.    The video encoder 53 re-encodes the decoded video data having a changed resolution in step 1002. The filter 55 provides hypertext data, into which the MPEG TS stream is demultiplexed, to the MUX 57 in step 1003.   The PSI generator 56 generates and embeds video transform information (a video transform descriptor) into the video element descriptor in step 1004.   The MUX 57 multiplexes the encoded video data (and audio data) and the hypertext data and outputs the result of multiplexing in step 1005.   The recording apparatus records PMT configuration information including the video transform information (a video transform descriptor) embedded in the video element descriptor in a navigation data area in step 1006 and records a multiplexed bitstream in a program area in step 1007.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram of a reproducing apparatus according to the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 11, the reproducing apparatus includes a decoder 5, a video transform information extractor 6, and a reader 4.    The reader 4 reads bitstream data and video transform information from a disc 300.    The video transform information extractor 6 extracts video transform information from bitstream data read by the reader 4 and provides it to the decoder 5.    The decoder 5 decodes the bitstream data into an original state referring to the video transform information.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an embodiment of the reproducing apparatus of FIG. 11. Referring to FIG. 12, the reproducing apparatus includes a reader 4, a DEMUX 60, a video decoder 61, an audio decoder 62, a filter 65, a PS! parser 66, a hypertext data decoder 63, and a blender 64.   In this embodiment, the PSI parser 66 is provided as the video transform information extractor 6.<br>
The reader 4 reads a bitstream from a disc 500 used as an information storage medium and outputs the bitstream.    Video data (and audio data) and hypertext data have been multiplexed in the bitstream.    Particularly, video transform information has been multiplexed in the bitstream in the form of a PMT packet according to the present invention.    The bitstream is output as a digital signal or<br>
digital signal.   The DEMUX 60 demultiplexes the bitstream into video data, audio data, hypertext data, and program information data.   The video decoder 61 decodes the video data according to original resolution and aspect ratio (video transform information) provided from the video transform information extractor 6 and provides the decoded video data to the blender 64.   The audio decoder 62 decodes the audio data and provides the decoded audio data to a sound output device.   The hypertext data decoder 63 decodes the hypertext data output from the filter 65 and provides the decoded hypertext data to the blender 64.    The blender 64 blends the video data with the hypertext data and outputs the result of blending.    The program information data is processed by the filter 65 and parsed by the PSI parser 66.<br>
A reproducing method according to the present invention will be described on the basis of the above configuration.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flowchart of a reproducing method according to a first embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 14, the video transform information extractor 6 transmits PMT configuration information corresponding to a program to be reproduced to the decoder 5 in step 1401.    The PMT configuration information contains video transform information.   The reader 4 reads a bitstream of the program in step 1402 and transmits it to the decoder 5 in step 1403.   The decoder 5 multiplexes the bitstream and the video transform information into a digital signal.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart of a reproducing method according to a second embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 15, the reader 4 reads an MPEG TS stream, into which video transform information has been multiplexed as PMT configuration information, from the disc 500 and outputs the MPEG TS stream in step 1501.   A reproducing apparatus reads and reproduces the MPEG TS stream containing video data which has been recorded at a changed resolution.    In other words, the DEMUX 60 demultiplexes the MPEG TS stream read from the disc 500 into video data, audio data, hypertext data, and program information data in step 1502.    The filter 65 performs filtering to output necessary hypertext data and program information data in step 1503.   The PSI parser 66 parses a video transform<br>
descriptor received from the filter 65 and provides the parsed video transform descriptor to the video decoder 61 in step 1504.   The video decoder 61 decodes the video data referring to the video transform descriptor so that the video data can have an original resolution in step 1505.   The audio decoder 62 decodes the audio data and outputs the decoded audio data to a sound output device (a speaker) in step 1506.    The hypertext data decoder 63 decodes the hypertext data in step 1507. The blender 64 blends the decoded video data and the decoded hypertext data and outputs the result of blending to a display device (not shown) in step 1508. Therefore, the video data and the hypertext data are displayed in an original state.<br>
FIG. 16 is a flowchart of a reproducing method according to a third embodiment of the present invention.    Referring to FIG. 16, the reader 4 reads an MPEG TS stream from the program area of the disc 400 and outputs it to the REMUX 67 and the DEMUX 60 in step 1601.   In step 1602, the reader 4 reads PMT configuration information from the navigation data area of the disc 400, and the video transform information extractor 6 generates a PMT packet based on the PMT configuration information and provides the PMT packet to the REMUX 67.    The REMUX 67 multiplexes the MPEG TS stream and the PMT packet into a digital signal in step 1603.    The DEMUX 60 demultiplexes the MPEG TS stream into video data, audio data, hypertext data, and program information data in step 1604.    The filter 65 performs filtering to output necessary hypertext data and program information data in step 1605.    The video transform information extractor 6 provides video transform information (a video transform descriptor) to the video decoder 61 in step 1606.    The video decoder 61 decodes the video data referring to the video transform information (the video transform descriptor) so that the video data can have an original resolution in step 1607.    The audio decoder 62 decodes the audio data and outputs the decoded audio data to a sound output device (a speaker) in<br><br>
step 1608.    The hypertext data decoder 63 decodes the hypertext data in step 1609. The blender 64 blends the decoded video data and the decoded hypertext data and outputs the result of blending to a display device (not shown) in step 1610. Therefore, the video data and the hypertext data are displayed in an original state.<br>
The above-described recording and reproducing methods can be embodied as computer programs.    Codes and code segments which compose the programs can be easily inferred by computer programmers skilled in the art.    In addition, the programs are recorded in a computer readable medium.   The programs are read and executed by a computer, thereby realizing methods of recording and reproducing an MPEG broadcast program.   The computer readable medium may be a magnetic recording medium, an optical recording medium, or a carrier wave medium.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, video data and hypertext data can be properly reproduced even if the video data has been re-encoded in different way to original one.<br>
