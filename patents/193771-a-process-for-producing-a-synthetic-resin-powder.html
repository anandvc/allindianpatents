BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic resin powder excellent in dispersibility in water.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Arts<br>
An aqueous emulsion comprising an aqueous medium and polymer particles with small particle diameters dispersed therein has been employed in a variety of uses such as admixtures for cement or mortar, adhesives, binders for coating materials and the like.  However, such an aqueous emulsion has involved the problems of a high transportation cost because of water as a dispersion medium contained in an amount of about 50% by weight, and disposal of the containers after use.<br>
Under such circumstances, there is a demand for a synthetic resin powder which, although being in the form of powder during transportation, can easily be dispersed in water by adding water thereto under stirring at the time of use.<br>
As a synthetic resin powder having dispersibility in water, there are known a vinyl ester polymer powder obtained by spray-drying an aqueous emulsion obtained through an emulsion polymerization of a vinyl ester monomer by the use of a polyvinyl alcohol (hereinafter abbreviated as "PVA") as a dispersant (disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-<br><br>
â€¢Open No. 185606/1992); and a (meth)acrylic ester polymer powder and a diolefinlc polymer powder each obtained by spray-drying an aqueous emulsion obtained through an emulsion polymerization of a (meth)acrylic ester monomer or a diolefinic monomer by the use of a low molecular weight surfactant as a dispersant.<br>
However, any of the conventional synthetic resin powders has involved the problem of low dispersibility in water.  In addition in the case of a vinyl ester polymer powder, there has been the problem of low alkali-resistance when used as an admixture for a mortar. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic resin powder which is excellent in dispersibility in water and well suited to use as an admixture for a mortar, etc.<br>
Intensive research and investigation were made by the present inventors in order to solve the above-mentioned problems.  As a result, there have been found a synthetic resin powder which comprises a polymer made from an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or a diolefinic monomer and a polyvinyl alcohol chemically bonded through a sulfide bond at an end (preferably at only one end) thereof to the surface of a particle of said polymer; a synthetic resin powder obtained by drying an aqueous emulsion produced through an emulsion polymerization of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or a diolefinic monomer in the presence of a<br><br>
polyvinyl alcohol having a mercapto group at an end (preferably at only one end) thereof; and an admixture for mortar which comprises said synthetic resin powder.  The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the foregoing finding. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the case of the synthetic resin powder according to the present invention, the polymer particle that becomes a dispersoid, when added to water, is the particle of a polymer made from an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or a diolefinic monomer.<br>
As examples of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, mention is made of olefins such as ethylene, propylene and isobutene; halogenated olefins such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl fluoride and vinylidene fluoride; vinyl esters such vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl versatate and vinyl pivalate; (meth)acrylic acid esters such as (meth)acrylic acid, methyl (meth)aerylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)aerylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)aerylate, tert-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate and octadecyl (meth)acrylate; acrylamide series monomers such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and sodium salts thereof; nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; allyl compounds<br><br>

One of these monomers is used alone or in combination with at least one other.<br>
On the other hand, the PVA chemically bonded (graft bonded) through a sulfide bond at an end thereof to the surface of the particle of the above-mentioned polymer, when added to water, exhibits the function as a dispersant.<br>

On the other hand in the case where the particle of the<br><br>
aforesaid polymer is that of a diolefinic polymer, the degree of polymerization of the PVA is preferably 100 to 2000, more preferably 100 to 1500.<br>
Whereas one kind of the PVA may be used alone, at least two kinds of the PVAs having a degree of polymerization different from each other can be used in combination so that the degree of polymerization of the combination falls within the above-mentioned range.<br>
On the other hand, from the viewpoints of water solubility, etc. of the PVA, the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA is preferably 40 to 99.99 mol%, more preferably 50 to 99.9 mol%, particularly preferably 60 to 99.5 mol%.<br>
As the PVA chemically bonded through a sulfide bond at an end thereof to the surface of the particle of the aforesaid polymer, preferable is a PVA originating from a PVA having a mercapto group at an end thereof.  As a PVA having a mercapto group at an end thereof, it is preferably a PVA having a mercapto group at one end only thereof from the viewpoints of preventing formation of disulfide bond in the PVA itself and preserving the water solubility thereof.<br>
The PVA having a mercapto group at only one end thereof can be obtained, for example, by hydrolyzing a polyvinyl ester obtained by polymerizing a vinyl ester monomer in the presence of a thiol acetate.<br>
As examples of the vinyl ester monomer, mention is made of vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl valerate, vinyl caprylate, vinyl laurate, vinyl stearate.<br><br>
vinyl benzoate and vinyl pivalate.  Of these, vinyl acetate is preferably from the industrial point of view.<br>
The PVA may be copolymerized with an other comonomer. As examples of the comonomer, mention is made of olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene and isobutene; (meth)acrylic acid; (meth)acrylic acid esters such as methyl (meth)aerylate, ethyl (meth)aerylate, n-propyl (meth)aerylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, tert-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate and octadecyl (meth)acrylate; vinyl ethers such as methylvinyl ether, n-propylvinyl ether, isopropylvinyl ether, n-butylvinyl ether, isobutylvinyl ether, tert-butylvinyl ether, dodecylvinyl ether and stearylvinyl ether; nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; halogenated vinyls such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl fluoride and vinylidene fluoride; allyl compounds such as allyl acetate and allyl chloride; carboxyl group-containing compound and esters thereof such as fumaric acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride and itaconic anhydride; sulfonic acid group-containing compounds such as ethylenesulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallysulfonic acid and 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid; vinyl-silane compound such as vinyltrimethoxysilane; isopropenyl acetate; and 3-(meth)acrylamidepropyltrimethylammonium chloride.  The content of these monomer units is preferably 5 mol% or less.<br><br>
The synthetic resin powder (secondary particle) according to the present invention has an average particle diameter preferably in the range of 1 to 1000 ym, more preferably in the range of 2 to 500 Pm.  It can be dispersed into a particle (primary particle), having smaller particle diameter by being added to water under stirring.<br>
The synthetic resin powder according to the present invention is obtained by drying an aqueous emulsion produced through an emulsion polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer or a diolefinic monomer in an aqueous medium in the presence of the PVA having a mercapto group at an end thereof.<br>
As examples of an initiator to be used for the emulsion polymerization, mention is made of water-soluble initiators such as potassium bromate, potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide and tert-butylhydroperoxide; and oil-soluble initiators such as azobis(isobutyronitrile) and benzoylperoxide.  Of these is preferable the initiator which generates a radical only by a redox reaction with a mercapto group at an end of the PVA.  One of these initiators is used alone or in a redox system in which the initiator is combined with a various kind of reducing agents.  As a method for adding the initiator tO/the reaction system, mention is made of a method in which the initiator is collectively added in the initial stage of the emulsion polymerization and a method in which the initiator is continuously added with the progress of the polymerization.<br><br>
The amount of the PVA to be used for emulsion polymerization is preferably 0.5 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight, particularly preferably 2 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer. In the case where the amount of the PVA is less than 0.5 part by weight, the emulsion polymerization stability becomes lower, the mechanical stability and/or chemical stability of the aqueous dispersion which is obtained by adding the synthetic resin powder to water becomes lower, and the film strength becomes lower.  On the other hand in the case where the amount of the PVA is more than 100 parts by weight, the viscosity increases during the emulsion polymerization, it becomes difficult to remove the heat of reaction, and the water resistance of films becomes lower.<br>
As a method for adding the PVA to the reaction system, mention is made of a method in which the PVA is collectively added in the initial stage of the emulsion polymerization and a method in which part of PVA is added in the initial stage thereof and the balance is continuously added with the progress of the polymerization.<br>
In the emulsion polymerization, the PVA having a mercapto group at an end thereof may be used in combination with a previously known surfactant of nonionic, anionic, cationic or ampholytic type, or a water-soluble polymer such as various PVAs or hydroxyethyl cellulose.<br>
As a method for adding the monomer to the reaction system, there are usable a method in which the monomer is<br><br>
collectively added in the initial stage of the emulsion polymerization, a method in which part of the monomer is added in the initial stage thereof and the balance is continuously added with the progress of the polymerization and a method in which the monomer which has been emulsified in water in advance by the use of a dispersant is continuously added.<br>
A chain transfer agent may be added in the emulsion polymerization.  As the chain transfer agent, a compound having a mercapto group is preferable from the standpoint of chain transfer efficiency, which is exemplified by alkyl mercaptans such as n-octyl mercaptan, n-dodecyl mercaptan and tert-dodecyl mercaptan, 2-mercaptoethyl alcohol and 3-mercaptopropionic acid.<br>
The amount of the chain transfer agent to be added is preferably 5 parts or less by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer.  In the case where the amount of the chain transfer agent is more than 5 parts by weight, the emulsion polymerization stability becomes lower, the molecular weight of the polymer particles becomes remarkably lower, and the physical properties of the film become lower.<br>
The synthetic resin powder according to the present invention is obtained by drying the aqueous emulsion produced through the above-mentioned emulsion polymerization.  As drying method, mention is made of spray drying, heating drying, blast drying, lyophilizing, etc.  Of these, spray drying is preferable.  As spraying method, mention is made of<br><br>
uiSG system, nozzle system, etc.  As the heat source for drying, mention is made of heated air, heated steam, etc.  As drying conditions, it is preferable to set the size and type of a spray dryer, and the concentration, viscosity and flow rate of the aqueous emulsion so as to obtain sufficiently dried powder at drying temperature in the range of 40 to 150'C.<br>
While the content of volatile matters in the synthetic resin powder is about equilibrium moisture content, it is preferably 3% or less by weight, more preferably 2% or less by weight.<br>
The synthetic resin powder according to the present invention may be incorporated with a water-soluble additive in order to further enhance its dispersibility in water.  The water-souble additive is preferably added to the aqueous emulsion, followed by spray drying.  The amount of the water-soluble additive to be added is set to the extent that such addition does not exert adverse influence on the physical properties such as water resistance of the synthetic resin powder.<br>

water-soluble polyamide resin, water-soluble acrylic resin, water-soluble polycarboxylic acid resin, water-soluble polyester resin, water-soluble polyurethane resin, water-soluble polyol resin and water-soluble epoxy resin.<br>
In addition, the synthetic resin powder according to the present invention is preferably incorporated with an antiblocking agent (anticaking agent) in order to further enhance its storage stability and dispersibility in water. The antiblocking agent may be added to the synthetic resin powder obtained by spray drying, followed by uniform mixing, but it is preferably added to the aqueous emulsion, followed by spray drying.<br>
The anitiblocking agent is preferably an inorganic powder in the form of fine particle having an average particle diameter of 0.1 to 10 um.  As the inorganic powder, mention is made of calcium carbonate, clay, anhydrous silicic acid, aluminum silicate, white carbon, talc and alumina white.  Moreover, an organic filler is usable.  The amount of the antiblocking agent to be used is preferably 20% or less by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.2 to 10% by weight based on the synthetic resin powder.<br>

a thickening agent, a waterproofing agent or the like.  The synthetic resin powder, when used for an adhesive, is incorporated with a viscosity improving agent, a water-retaining agent, a tackifying agent, a thickening agent or the like.  The synthetic resin powder, when used for a paint binder, is incorporated with a viscosity improving agent, a thickening agent, a pigment-dispersing agent, a stabilizing agent or the like.<br>
Although the synthetic resin powder of the present invention can be in the form of powder during transportation, it can easily be dispersed in water by adding water thereto under stirring, because it is excellent in dispersibility in water and blocking resistance.  The synthetic resin powder is excellent also in film forming properties, and thus can preferably be used as an admixture for a mortar, etc.<br>
The synthetic resin powder according to the present invention, when used as an admixture for a mortar, is incorporated therein in an amount of preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight, more preferably 2 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of a cement contained in the mortar.<br>
As a method for adding the synthetic resin powder to a mortar or cement, mention is made of a method comprising the steps of preparing in advance an aqueous dispersion of the synthetic resin powder and thereafter preparing a composition of an aqueous slurry of mortar and the aqueous dispersion thus prepared; a method in which the synthetic resin powder is added in the form of powder to an aqueous slurry of mortar<br><br>
at the time of its preparation; a method in which the synthetic resin powder is added in the form of powder to a powdery composition of cement and sand, etc. and thereafter a composition of an aqueous slurry of the mortar and the synthetic resin powder is prepared; and the like methods.  Of these, the lastly described method is most preferable.<br>
The composition of the aqueous slurry of motar obtained by adding the synthetic resin powder (admixture for mortar) according to the present invention is cured usually by a conventional method and is made into a molded product.<br>
The aforesaid molded product is favorably used for the same use as that of the conventional mortar-molded product which is incorporated with the emulsion of acrylic acid ester polymer or the emulsion of styrene/butadiene copolymer (SBR).<br>

Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing a synthetic resin powder, comprising the steps of emulsion-polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or a diolefinic monomer in the presence of a polyvinyl alcohol having a mercapto group at its polymer chain end thereby producing an aqueous emulsion of the synthetic resin which comprises a polymer particle of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer or the diolefinic monomer and the polyvinyl alcohol chemically bonded to the surface of the polymer particle through a sulfide linkage derived from the mercapto group and drying the aqueous emulsion of the synthetic resin.<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example, in which;<br>
Example 1:<br>
A glass-made vessel equipped with a reflux condenser, a dropping<br>
funnel, a thermometer, a nitrogen blowing-in nozzle and a stirrer was<br>
charged with a parts of PVA having a	<br><br>
'mercapto group at only one end thereof (PVA-1: degree of<br>
polymerization of 1500, degree of hydrolysis of 96.0 mol%,<br>
-5 mercapto group content of 1.5 X 10  equivalent/g) and 90<br>
parts of ion-exchanged water, and the PVA was completely<br>
dissolved in the water at 95Â°C.  The resultant aqueous<br>
solution of the PVA was adjusted to pH=4 with dilute sulfuric<br>
acid, and incorporated, under stirring at 150 r.p.m., with 10<br>
parts of vinyl acetate.  Then, the reaction system was<br>
replaced with nitrogen, and the temperature in the system was<br>
raised to 60Â°C.  Subsequently, emulsion polymerization was<br>
initiated by adding to the system, 5 parts of aqueous<br>
solution of tartaric acid having a concentration of 5% and<br>
thereafter continuously adding thereto aqueous solution of<br>
hydrogen peroxide having a concentration of 0.5%.  To the<br>
system was continuously added 90 parts of vinyl acetate over<br>
a period of 2 hours.  The polymerization was finished at the<br>
time when the concentration of the residual vinyl acetate<br>
reached as low as 1% after 3 hours from the start of the<br>
polymerization.  As a result, there was obtained a stable<br>
emulsion of polyvinyl acetate having a solid concentration of<br>
50.5%.<br>
The mixture of 100 parts of the emulsion thus obtained<br>
and 100 parts of water, and fine powder of anhydrous silicic<br>
acid (average particle diameter of 2 ym) in an amount of 3%<br>
based on the solid content in the aforesaid emulsion, were<br>
sprayed separately and simultaneously into hot air at 100"C<br>
and dried.  As a result, there was obtained a synthetic resin<br><br>
'powder having an average particle diameter of 60 u m.  The results of evaluation of the powder are given in Tables 1 and 2. Comparative Example 1<br>
The procedure in Example 1 was repeated to produce emulsion except that the dispersant as given in Table 1 was used in place of PVA-1.  Subsequently, the procedure in Example 1 was repeated to produce a synthetic resin powder except that the emulsion thus obtained was used.  The results of evaluation of the powder are given in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br>

acid, and incorporated, under stirring at 150 r.p.m., with 10<br>
parts of methyl methacrylate, 10 parts of n-butyl aerylate<br>
and 0.1 part of n-dodecyl mercaptan.  Then, the reaction<br>
system was replaced with nitrogen, and the temperature in the<br>
system was raised to 70Â°C.  Subsequently, emulsion<br><br>
