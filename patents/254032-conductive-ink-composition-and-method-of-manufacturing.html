The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a conductive ink. composition comprising a metal complex compound having a special structure and an additive and a preparing method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, conductive ink is drawing attention since it is useful in metal film or pattern formation and electrode printing in the field of lead (Pb) free electric/electronic circuits, low-resistance metal wirings, printed circuit boards (PCB), flexible printed circuit boards (FPC), antennas for radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, plasma displays (PDP), liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD), organic light emitting diodes (OLED), flexible displays and organic thin film transistors (OTFT).<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-221006 (August 5, 2004) and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-273205 (September 30, 2004) disclose conductive inks in the form of a paste prepared from nanoparticle, powder or flake of metal or metal alloy using a binder resin or a solvent. Chem. Mater.,  15, 2208 (2003), Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 11-319538 (November 24,1999), Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2004-256757 (September 10, 2004) and U.S. Patent No. 4,762,560 (August 9, 1988) disclose the method of reacting such metal compounds as silver nitrate, hydrogen tetrachloroaurate and copper sulfate with other compounds in an aqueous solution or an organic solvent to form colloids or nanoparticles. However, these methods are uneconomical and less stable and require a complicated process.  In addition, the high baking temperature makes them inappropriate to be applied for a variety of substrates.<br>
2<br><br>
Carboxylate is well known as a ligand that forms complexes, particularly organic metal complexes Prog.   Inorg.   Chem.,   10, p. 233 (1968) . In general, since metal carboxylate complexes are less soluble in organic solvents J.   Chem.   Soc,    (A).,  p. 514 (1971), U.S. Patent No. 5,534,312 (July 9, 1996) and are discomposed at high temperature, they are limited in application in spite of easiness in preparation. Several methods have been proposed to solve this problem in J.   Inorg.  Nucl.   Chem.,   40, p. 1599 (1978), Ang.   Chem., Int. Ed. Engl.,  31, p. 770 (1992), Eur. J. Solid State Inorg. Chem., 32, p. 25 (1995), J.   Chem.   Cryst.,   26, p. 99 (1996), Chem.   Vapor Deposition, 1,  111 (2001) , Chem. Mater., 16, 2021 (2004) , U.S. Patent No. 5,705,661 (January 6, 1998), Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-329419 (November 15, 2002) and Korean Patent Publication No. 2003-0085357 (November 5, 2003) .  Of them are the methods of using a carboxylate compound with a long alkyl chain or using an amine compound or a phosphine compound.<br>
The present inventors have presented stable and highly soluble complex compounds and preparation methods thereof in Korean Patent Application Nos. 2005-11475 and 2005-11478. Particularly, in Korean Patent Application Nos. 2005-18364 and 2005-23013, they presented stalbe and transparent conductive ink compositions with superior solubility and good conductivity, metal content of which and film thickness can be easily controlled, and methods for forming metal patterns easily even at low temperature using the compositions. However, a variety of conductive inks are required to produce high-quality specialty products or to meet the situation where special properties are needed.<br>
According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Ind. Chem., Vol. A24, 107 (1993) , silver is a percious metal which is not oxidized easily and has good electrical and thermal conductivity and catalytic and antibacterial activity, and thus silver and silver compounds are<br>
3<br><br>
used widely in the industries, in silver alloys, plating, medicines, photographs, electric and electronic products, fibers, detergents, household appliances, etc. In addition, silver compounds can be used as catalyst in the synthesis of organic compounds and polymers. Particularly, silver is recently used in the new fields that require metal patterns or electrodes, including lead-free electric/electronic circuits, low-resistance metal wiring, PCBs, FPCs, antennas for RFIDtags, EMI shielding, PDPs, TFT-LCDs, OLEDs, flexible displays and OTFTs.<br>
Of recent, researches for replacing aluminum with silver, which has better reflection and conduction properties, in reflection film for reflection type or semi-transparent type LCDs are in progress, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-129259 (May 9, 2002), Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-176115 (June 24, 2004) and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-231982 (August 19, 2004).<br>
However, compounds derived from silver are limited and they<br>
lack stability and solubility.   In addition,  they have a<br>
decomposition temperature of 200 Â°C or higher, which is too high<br>
- to obtain a metal pattern with good conductivity, and are decomposed<br>
slowly.<br>
The present inventors have worked consistently to solve these problems and come to complete this invention. The present invention provides a conductive ink composition having very superior stability and solubility, enabling easy formation of thin film and being easily calcined even at low temperature, thereby enabling formation of uniform and percise film or pattern with good conductivity regardless of the particular substrate used, and a method for preparing the same.<br>

Preparation method of the ammonium carbamate- or ammonium carbonate-based compound represented by the formulas 2 to 4 and is not particularly limited.   For example,  the  ammonium carbamate-based compound may be prepared from a primary amine, a secondary amine, a tertiary amine or a mixture thereof and carbon dioxide, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,542,214 (September 17, 1985), J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc,   123, p. 10393 (2001), Langmuir,   18, p. 71247 (2002) . An ammonium carbonate-based compound is obtained if 0.5 mole of water is used per 1 mole of amine and an ammonium bicarbonate-based compound is obtained when 1 mole or more of water is used. The preparation may be performed under normal pressure or appied pressure without a solvent or in the presence of such solvent as alcohols like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol andbutanol, glycols like ethylene glycol and glycerine, acetates like ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and carbitol acetate, ethers like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, ketones like methyl ethyl ketone and acetone, hydrocarbons like hexane and heptane, aromatic solvents like benzene and toluene and halogen-substituted solvents like chloroform, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride.  The carbon dioxide may be bubbled in gas phase or used in the form of dry ice. Alternatively, the preparation may be performed in the supercritical phase. Any other known methods can be applied in the preparation of the ammonium carbamate derivative and ammonium the carbonate-based derivative used in the present invention, as long as the final sturcutre is the same.  That is, solvent, reaction temperature, concentration, catalyst, etc. are not particularly<br>
9<br><br>
limited in the preparation.   Nor the preparation yield is particularly limited.<br>
Along with the carbon dioxide, a composite ammonium compound obtained by reacting an amine compound with a triatomic molecule may be used. For example, an adduct obtained by reacting an amine compound such as propylamine, decylamine and octadecyl amine with nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide or carbon disulfide, refer to Langmuir,  19, p. 1017 (2003) and Langmuir,  19, p. 8168 (2003), may be used along with the ammonium compound of the present invention. Or, a composite ammonium carbamate or carbonate-based compound may be prepared directly during the reaction with amine, using the triatomic molecule and carbon dioxide. Besides, a compound obtained by reacting the amine compound with a boron compound such as boric acid and boron acid can be used and such ammonium compound as ammonium sulfamate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium hydrogensulfate, ammonium sulfite and a mixture therof may be used.<br>
The ammonium carbamate- or ammonium carbonate-based compound is reacted with the metal or metal compound to prepare a metal complex compound. For examlpe, at least one metal or metal compound represented by the formula 1 and at least one ammonium carbamate-or ammonium carbonate-based compound represnted by the formulas 2, 3 or 4 are reacted under nitrogen atmosphrere at normal pressure or applied pressure without a solvent or in the presence of such solvent as water, alcohols like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol, glycols like ethylene glycol and glycerine, acetates like ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and carbitol acetate, ethers like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, ketones like methyl ethyl ketone and acetone, hydrocarbons like hexane and heptane, aromatic solvents like benzene and toluene and halogen-substituted solvents like chloroform, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride or a mixture thereof.  Alternatively, the metal<br>
10<br><br>
complex compound may be prepared by preparing a solution comprising the metal or metal compound represented by the formula 1 and at least one amine compound and reacting the solution with carbon dioxide. This reaction may also be performed under normal pressure or applied pressure without a solvent or in the presence of a solvent. However, the perapration method of the metal complex compound is not particularly limited and any known methods can be applied, as long as the final structure is the same. That is, solvent, reaction temperature, concentration, catalyst, etc. are not particularly limited. Nor the preparation yield is particularly limited.<br>

11<br><br>
invention, and one endowed with conductivity through heat treatment, oxidation or reduction treatment, IR, UV, electron beam or laser treatment, etc. is more preferred. For example, the metal precursor may be an organometal compound or metal salt and, in general, is represented by the formula 1, where M is at least one metal selected from Ag, Au, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Pd, Pt, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, W, Ru, Cd, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, Al, Ga, Ge, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi, Sm, Eu, Ac and Th or an alloy thereof, n is an integer from 1 to 10 and X is at least one substituent selected from hydrogen, ammonium, oxygen, sulfur, halogen, cyano, cyanate, carbonate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, phosphate, thiocyanate, chlorate, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, acetylacetonate, mercapto, amide, alkoxide, carboxylate and derivatives thereof.<br>

They may be in the form of particle, incluidngnanoparticle, powder, flake, colloid, hybrid, paste, sol, solution or a combination thereof. Size or content of the conductor or metal precursor is not particularly limited, as long as they do not negatively affect the properties of the ink. Preferably, the conductor or metal precursor is equal to or smaller than 50 microns in size, considering the film thickness after calcination, more preferably between 1 nm and 25 microns. It is<br>
12<br><br>
preferable that they are not used in excess, so that the calcination<br>
temperature does not rise excessively or coating or pattern formation<br>
is not negatively affected. In general, they are used in 1-90 wt%,<br>
preferably in 10-70 wt%, per 100 wt% of the entire ink composition.<br>
     An oxidant may be used as additive in the preparation of the<br>

The ink composition prepared in accordance with the present invention has superior stability and thus can be easily formed into film or pattern using a variety of substrates through coating or printing. For example, it may be coated or directly printed on such substrate as metal, glass, silicon wafer, ceramic, plastic film like polyester or polyimide, rubber sheet, fiber, wood and paper. The substrate may be used after washing with water, fat removal or special pre-treatment. Examples of the pre-treatment method are plasma, ion beam or corona treatment, oxidation or reduction, heating, etching, UV treatment, primer treatment using the afore-mentioned binder or additive, etc. Filmpreprationorprintingmaybeperformed by spin coating, roll coating, spray coating, dip coating, flow coating, doctor blade coating, dispensing, ink-jet printing, offset printing,  screen printing,  pad printing,  gravure printing, flexography, stencil printing, imprinting, xerography, lithography, etc., considering the physical properties of the ink.<br>
The viscosity of the ink of the present invention is not particularly limited, as long as the film formation or printing is not negatively affected. Although changeable depending on the prepration method and particular kind of the ink, a viscosity in the range from 0.1 to 1,000,000 cps is preferable and one in the range from 1 to 500,000 cps is more preferable. The viscosity of the ink becomes an important factor when film or pattern formation is performed by ink-jet printing. In such case, a viscosity in the range from 0.1 to 50 cps, preferably in the range from 1 to 20 cps,<br>
18<br><br>
more preferably in the range from 2-15 cps, is favorable. If the viscosity is smaller, conductivity may be not enough because of insufficient film thickness. In contrast, if the viscosity is larger, the ink may not easily flow.<br>
Such prepared film or pattern may be post-treated by oxidation or reduction, heat treatment, IR, UV, electronbeamor laser treatment, etc. for metal or metal oxide pattern formation. The heat treatment may be performed under inert gas atmosphere, or in air, nitrogen or carbon monoxide or in a mixture gas comprising hydrogen and air or other inert gas, depending on the need. The heat treatment is usually performed at 80-500 Â°C, preferably at 90-300 Â°C, more preferably at 100-250 Â°C, for better physical properties of the film. The heat treatment may be performed at different temperatures for filmuniformity.  Forexample, the heat treatmentmay be performed at 80-150 Â°C for 1-30 minutes, and then at 150-300 Â°C for 1-30 minutes . The present invention provides a variety of conductive ink compositions comprising a metal complex compound obtained by reacting at least one metal or metal compound represented by the formula 1 with at least one ammonium carbamate- or ammonium carbonate-based compound represented by the formula 2, 3 or 4 and an additive.<br>
The ink composition of the present invention has superior stability and solubility, enables easy film formation and is readily calcined even at low temperature of 200 Â°C or below to form film or pattern with good conductivity. The ink composition of the present invent ion may be coated or directly printed on a variety of substrates, including metal, glass, silicon wafer, ceramic, plastic film like polyester or polyimide, rubber sheet, fiber, wood and paper. Depending on the physical properties of the ink, a variety of film formation or printing methods, such as spin coating, roll coating, spray coating, dip coating, flow coating, doctor blade coating and<br>
19<br><br>
dispensing, ink-jet printing, offset printing, screen printing, pad printing, gravure printing, flexography, stencil printing, imprinting, xerography, lithography, etc. are applicalbe.<br>
Use of the ink composition of the present invention enables formation of uniform film having supeiror conductivity and adhesivity. Moreover, the film is hardly cracked.<br>
In addition, the ink composition of the present invention may be used in EMI shielding materials, conductive adhesives, low-resistance metal wirings, PCBs, FPCs, antennas for RFID tags, solar cells, secondary cells or fuel cell and electrodes or wirings of PDPs, TFT-LCDs, OLEDs, flexible displays and OTFTs.<br>
