				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a sewage treatment control device and method<br>
and a sewage treatment system using the same, and more particularly, to a sewage<br>
treatment control device and method and a sewage treatment system using the same, in<br>
which if abnormal operation or failure of a measuring device for setting a water quality<br>
target value is detected, another measuring device may be used to set the water quality<br>
target value, and an improved sewage treatment apparatus may be used to reduce<br>
operational costs.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As society has generally been developed, the quantity of water used has increased,<br>
and a sewage treatment apparatus has been used for treating the used water. In such a<br>
sewage treatment apparatus, a biological treatment process has been frequently used, and a<br>
physical-chemical treatment process in addition to the biological treatment process has<br>
been recently used.<br>
This biological treatment process uses microorganisms to dissolve pollutant<br>
materials, and waste sludge may be generated when microorganisms are used to dissolve<br>
pollutant materials. Further, in the physical-chemical treatment process, chemicals are<br>
added and mixers or the like are used to mix the chemicals, so that pollutant materials can<br>
be quickly and efficiently removed. However, the physical-chemical treatment process is<br>
uneconomical because the continuous supply of chemicals, the increase of the generated<br>
sludge, the stirring operation, and the like result in the increase of treatment costs.<br>
Further, the physical-chemical treatment process is undesirable in that if the amount of<br>
chemicals is too small to remove pollutant materials, the removal efficiency of pollutant<br>
materials may be reduced, while if the amount of chemicals is too large, other pollutions<br><br>
may be generated due to the misappropriation of chemicals.<br>
Meanwhile, although the biological treatment process may not quickly remove<br>
pollutant materials, there is an advantage in that the biological treatment process is stable,<br>
reliable and economical in a long-term view and does not generate another environmental<br>
pollution. Nevertheless, the biological treatment process leaves much room for<br>
improvement so far.<br>
The conventional sewage treatment system receives water so that a state of the<br>
sewage treatment system may be changed into one of an anaerobic state, an anoxic state<br>
and an aerobic state, and the sewage treatment system includes a sewage treatment<br>
apparatus, which has a biological reactor whose a discharge portion is controlled to be<br>
opened/closed in order to change a flow path, and a sewage treatment control device for<br>
controlling the sewage treatment apparatus according to the set values.<br>
The sewage treatment apparatus which is controlled by various processes as<br>
described above controls the sewage treatment processes under different conditions<br>
depending on the water quality of the inflow sewage, so that the sewage treatment<br>
performance and the economic efficiency can be improved and another environmental<br>
pollution can be minimized.<br>
The sewage treatment control device as described above has used a temporal<br>
control method in which on/off operation is repeated during a predetermined interval by<br>
means of PLC, DCS and PC control devices, a quantitative control method in which a<br>
constant target value is set for quantitative control, a manual control method in which a<br>
target value is manually controlled by an operator, or a programmable control method in<br>
which a given variable target value program is used for control.<br>
When the constant target value is used to operate the sewage treatment control<br>
device, it is impossible to quickly cope with an external environmental change.<br>
Meanwhile, the manual control method in which the target value is manually controlled<br>
depends on the specialty of an operator. Accordingly, if the operator has no specialty,<br>
appropriate control is impossible and a sewage treatment process may be controlled under<br>
the subjective control condition of the operator.<br>
Accordingly, a method for controlling a sewage treatment process has been<br><br>
recently used, in which a target value is appropriately set depending on a water quality load<br>
and a water quality state, and a variable target value is set by a given program.<br>
Meanwhile, the conventional biological sewage treatment process does not<br>
effectively remove pollutant materials such as nitrogen and phosphorous in addition to<br>
BOD and SS because pollutant materials such as living wastewater, industrial wastewater<br>
and livestock wastewater have increased and secondary treatment facilities of the activated<br>
sludge method is limited, and therefore, the water pollution has been really going on.<br>
Accordingly, apparatuses and methods for effectively removing pollutant<br>
materials such as nitrogen and phosphorous have been developed, and the methods are<br>
classified into a physical-chemical treatment method and a biological treatment method<br>
depending on their treatment manner.<br>
The biological sewage treatment method includes an anaerobic zone, an anoxic<br>
zone, an aerobic zone, or the like, and may be represented as an A2/O method, an<br>
intermittent aeration method and an SBR method.<br>
In the aforementioned A2/O series sewage treatment apparatus, internal partition<br>
walls are installed within a biological reactor to spatially separate the biological reactor<br>
into small chambers in order to identify an anaerobic (zone) state, an anoxic (zone) state<br>
and an aerobic (zone) state. The A2/O series sewage treatment apparatus is very useful<br>
for a large-scaled sewage treatment, is relatively resistant to load variations, and maintains<br>
a stably treated water quality which is over a predetermined level.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 which is a flowchart of the conventional A2/O series sewage<br>
treatment apparatus, the conventional A2/O series sewage treatment apparatus allows<br>
inflow water, such as sewage and polluted waste water, which has been settled and treated<br>
in a primary clarifier to partially remove suspended solid materials, to be introduced into a<br>
biological reactor.<br>
The internal portion of the biological reactor is divided into an anaerobic zone 10,<br>
an anoxic zone 12 and an aerobic zone 14 by partition walls. Further, the inflow water<br>
which has passed through the biological reactor is stored in a secondary clarifier 16, in<br>
which foreign materials are settled and then the water is discharged outward.<br>
At this time, the sludge generated in the secondary clarifier 16 is reintroduced into<br><br>
the anaerobic zone, so that the retreatment process is performed.<br>
Further, in order to improve the removal efficiency of nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen<br>
should be converted into nitrate nitrogen in the aerobic (zone) state, and then, an internal<br>
recycle pump or a propeller-type submarine transfer apparatus should be used to perform<br>
the internal recycle into the anoxic (zone) state.<br>
As described above, the A2/O series sewage treatment apparatus separates the<br>
treatment stages from each other by the partition walls, whereas the intermittent aeration<br>
and SBR series sewage treatment apparatuses separately operate the anaerobic state, the<br>
anoxic state and the aerobic state via temporal control.<br>
That is, the conventional intermittent aeration or SBR series sewage treatment<br>
apparatuses has one biological reactor, and is controlled to operate the biological reactor in<br>
the anaerobic state, the anoxic state and the aerobic state under different conditions with<br>
the passage of time, without requiring the internal recycle as described in the conventional<br>
A2/O series sewage treatment apparatus.<br>
As such, the conventional sewage treatment methods identify the anaerobic state,<br>
the anoxic state and the aerobic state via the spatial or temporal separation (control), and<br>
are operated while the minimum dissolve oxygen concentration of 2.0 mg/L or more is<br>
maintained in the aerobic state. In addition, a mixer is installed in the biological reactor<br>
in the anoxic or anaerobic state, so that the contents therein may be completely mixed by a<br>
physical method, and if the internal recycle is performed, an internal recycle pump or the<br>
like is required.<br>
Meanwhile, the operational control of the sewage treatment apparatus is mainly<br>
dependent on conditions, such as the inflow amount of sewage, a pollutant load in inflow<br>
sewage, and microorganism concentration in the biological reactor, and these conditions<br>
are determined by a flow rate measuring apparatus, a water quality measuring apparatus,<br>
an experimental value, and the like.<br>
The inflow amount of sewage, which is most influential among these operational<br>
conditions of the sewage treatment apparatus, is highly fluid depending on time, day,<br>
month and season. Accordingly, if the sewage treatment apparatus is operated by a<br>
determined quantitative control condition, much time and budget may be wasted to<br><br>
maintain the normal operation, and thus, it is not easy to implement the normal operation.<br>
Further, since a change of operational conditions depending on experimental values causes<br>
an experiment procedure to be complicated and to require much time, it is difficult to cope<br>
with the conditions such as the flow rate and the pollutant load amount which are changed<br>
in real time. When a target value is manually determined, there is a problem in that a<br>
permanently stationed manager should adjust the target value depending on variable<br>
conditions.<br>
Recently, although many automatic operational control methods using flow rate<br>
sensors and water quality measuring sensors have been developed, an error range in the<br>
measuring sensitivity of the water quality measuring sensors increases and frequency of<br>
maintenance occurrence for the sensors increases with the passage of time in comparison<br>
with their initial installment, so that there may be technical problems such as component<br>
replacement and periodic maintenance and economical problems such as component<br>
replacement and dual installment cost. As such, the operational control of the sewage<br>
treatment process depending on the sensors has not been really implemented.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram schematically showing a sewage treatment control<br>
device of a sewage treatment system according to a prior art. Referring to Fig. 2, a<br>
sewage treatment control device 50 is equipped with a measuring unit 51, which has<br>
sensors for inspecting specific components in water, and the measuring unit 51 is<br>
connected to a target value setting unit 52. As the component values measured from the<br>
measuring unit 51 are input, the target value setting unit 52 sets target values of operational<br>
conditions required for the sewage treatment.<br>
In addition to the method in which the sewage treatment control device 50 is<br>
automatically operated by the set values measured by the measuring unit 51, the sewage<br>
treatment control device 50 has a manual setting unit 53 in which a target value is set<br>
depending on a component value which is input by an operator. Further, the sewage<br>
treatment control device 50 is equipped with a signal selection unit 55 for selectively<br>
connecting either the target value setting unit 52 or the manual setting unit 53, and an<br>
automatic/manual mode selection unit 54 in which an operator may select either an<br>
automatic mode or a manual mode to select the signal selection unit 55. Further, the<br><br>
target value input from the signal selection unit 55 is transferred to a PID control unit 56<br>
and is converted into a control signal by proportional, integral or derivative action. In<br>
addition, the PID control unit 56 is connected to a sewage treatment apparatus 57, and the<br>
sewage treatment apparatus 57 is manipulated depending on the converted control signal to<br>
treat the sewage.<br>
Meanwhile, the sewage treatment control device 50 includes a control<br>
compensation unit in which the target value inputted from the signal selection unit 55 and<br>
the measured value measured from the water that has passed through the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus 57 are compared with each other and the target value to be inputted to the PID<br>
control unit 56 may then be compensated. The control compensation unit includes a final<br>
measuring unit 58, which has a sensor installed to an outlet side of the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus 57 to inspect a specific component of water, and a comparison unit 59, which is<br>
installed to an inlet side of the PID control unit 56 to compare the specific component<br>
value anticipated from the set target value and the specific component value inspected by<br>
the final measuring unit 58 and correct the target value so that the anticipated specific<br>
component value may be converged into the inspected specific component value.<br>
Although the sewage treatment system configured as described above<br>
conventionally measures one specific component with one water quality measuring unit, a<br>
difference in sensitivity of the sensor may be generated as the water quality measuring unit<br>
has been operated for a long time. Accordingly, a measuring error and an economical<br>
problem such as maintenance occur.<br>
In order to solve these problems, a scheme has been proposed in the conventional<br>
sewage treatment system, in which a plurality of water quality measuring units are installed,<br>
so that the measuring values between the water quality measuring units are compared with<br>
each other, or when there is a failure of one water quality measuring unit, the disabled<br>
water quality measuring unit may be replaced with another water quality measuring unit to<br>
measure the water quality. However, since the water quality measuring unit is expensive,<br>
the scheme has not been used as a realistic alternative scheme.<br>
Accordingly, most sewage treatment systems conventionally used in the domestic<br>
region have not been used for a long time after the initial installation due to an increase of<br><br>
maintenance or incessant adjustments of the sensors. There is a problem in that it does<br>
not quickly cope with external factors such as extinction of microorganisms, a failure of<br>
the system, variations in flow rate of the inflow water and variations in the load amount, so<br>
that the function of the sewage treatment process may be lost.<br>
Further, although the conventional sewage treatment system provides a<br>
monitoring and control system using the real-time water quality monitoring, it dose not<br>
provide a system which may check whether or not the monitoring and control system is<br>
abnormal, and therefore, the reliability for the monitoring and control system is<br>
considerably low. In addition, if the conventional sewage treatment plant is modified by<br>
an advanced treatment method, the period of time required to install partition walls and<br>
submarine machinery is so long that the treatment efficiency for the sewage treatment plant<br>
may be dramatically reduced during the construction period of time, thereby aggravating<br>
the pollutions in the neighboring rivers.<br>
Further, in the conventional sewage treatment system, high dissolved oxygen<br>
concentration is maintained in an aerobic state and a mixer is installed and continuously<br>
operated in an anaerobic or anoxic state, large operational cost is necessary to operate the<br>
sewage treatment apparatus.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for the improvement of the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus in the conventional sewage treatment system as well as the fundamental<br>
improvement of the control method for controlling the sewage treatment apparatus.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

prior art. An object of the present invention is to provide a sewage treatment control<br>
device and method and a sewage treatment system using the same, in which it is possible<br>

measuring unit is abnormally operated; when an expensive measuring unit for measuring a<br>
specific component is out of order, an inexpensive measuring unit for measuring another<br>
specific component can be used to convert a target value to thereby replace the expensive<br><br>

The sewage treatment system according to the present invention comprises a<br>

Here, the sewage treatment control device 100 has measuring units 101 for<br>

pressure, water level or sludge interface, turbidity, pH, and the like. Herein, the dissolved<br>
oxygen may be used to measure the amount of oxygen required to react an ammonia<br>
material in order to remove sewage pollutant material with microorganisms. Further, the<br>
nitrate may be used to measure reactant of ammonia nitrogen which has been treated by<br>
microorganisms! Furthermore, the mixed liquor suspended solid refers to suspended solid<br>
which is included in the sewage to be treated and may be used to measure concentration of<br>
microorganisms in a sewage treatment process. In addition, the measuring units 101 may<br>
measure temperature of water, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen<br>
demand (COD), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and the like.<br>
In addition, the measuring units 101 are connected to validity verification units<br>
102, respectively. The validity verification units 102 determine validities of the<br>
component values measured in the measuring units 101.<br>
The validity verification units 102 determine whether or not signals of the<br>
measured component values are activated with a predetermined voltage or whether or not a<br>
variation range of the measured component values is included within a predetermined<br>
range. Further, the validity verification units 102 determine the validity by determining<br>
the variation rates of the measured component values, and may determine whether or not<br>
the sensors are normally operated through the variation numbers during a predetermined<br>
period of time.<br>
In addition, the validity verification units 102 are connected to target value setting<br>
units 103, respectively, in which target values for the component values measured in the<br>
respective measuring units 101 are set.<br>
In the target value setting units 103, the target values for the component values to<br>
be inputted have been previously set with functional relationships. For example, if the<br>
component value for ammonia (NH4) is inputted, the target value setting units 103 can<br>
obtain the target value for the dissolved oxygen (DO). Here, the target value function for<br>
NH4 may be expressed as Chemical Formula 1:<br><br><br>
That is, if the component value for NH4 is inputted, the component value for O2<br>
required to be chemically changed into NO3 (nitrate) can be obtained. On the other hand,<br>
if the component value for NO3 is inputted, the component value for O2 required to change<br>
NH4 can be obtained.<br>
As described above, an alternative function for a specific component may be used,<br>
e.g., oxygen uptake rate (OUR) can be calculated by using BOD and MLSS input flow rate,<br>
and therefore, DO can be measured.<br>
The setting principle by which the target values may be replaced will be described<br>
later.<br>
The nitrification reaction is a process in which ammonia nitrogen is oxidized into<br>
nitrous acid and nitric acid by nitrification microorganisms in an aerobic condition, and it<br>
is classified into an ammonia oxidation process and a nitrous acid oxidation process, which<br>
are expressed as Chemical Formula 2:<br><br>
where the theoretical total oxygen demand required to oxidize ammonia into nitric acid is<br>
about 4.57g-O2/g-N, among which the amounts of oxygen required in the ammonia<br>
oxidization process and the nitrous acid oxidization process are 3.43g-O2/g-N and 1.14-<br>
O2/g-N, respectively. At this time, nitrification microorganisms use carbonic acid gas in<br>
wastewater as an inorganic carbon source, and the hydrogen ion (H+) generated through the<br>
nitrification process will cause alkalinity in wastewater to be reduced. Theoretically,<br>
alkalinity of 7.14 mg (as CaCO3) is required to oxidize 1 mg NH4+-N.<br>
In the nitrification reaction, inorganic carbon is required during a cellular<br>
synthesis process. At this time, most energy obtained from the oxidation of nitrogen is<br><br>
used to deoxidize carbon dioxide into a cell. The stoichiometrical formula in which the<br>
cellular synthesis is considered can be expressed as Chemical Formula 3:<br><br>
where yields of the ammonia oxidizer and the nitrite oxidizer are applied as 0.08g-<br>
VSS/g-NH4+-N and 0.05g-VSS/g-NO2--N, respectively. Here, C5H7NO2 refers to<br>
nitrosomonas.<br>
Generally, it is well known that the nitrification reaction is principally caused by<br>
chemoautotrophic bacteria. Nitrosomonas sp. among the microorganisms related to the<br>
nitrification reaction is a representative microorganism by which ammonia is oxidized<br>
through hydroxylamine into nitrous acid, and there are other microorganisms such as<br>
Nitrosospira briensis, Nitrosococcus nitrous and Nitrosolobus multiformis. The principal<br>
microorganism for oxidizing nitrous acid into nitric acid is Nitrobacter sp., and it is also<br>
known that there are marine microorganisms such as Nitrosospina gracilis and<br>
Nitrosococcus mobils.<br>
As described above, since the reaction related to a nitrification process occurs in a<br>
field reactor (in an aeration state), the control relationship and flow is analogized to be a<br>
simplified reaction formula such as 'NH4 amount + O2 amount → NO3 amount', so that the<br>
object to be controlled is O2 (or dissolved oxygen (DO)) and the relationship parameters<br>
required for the control are NH4 and NO3.<br>
Further, by the quantitative chemical reaction relationship, ammonia (NH4) (i.e.,<br>
the reaction amount), oxygen (i.e., the required amount) and nitrate (i.e., the production<br>
amount) can measure a state (quantitative reaction amount) of the reactor by installing NH4,<br>
NO3 and DO measuring units in a control system, and the oxygen amount to be required<br>
during the aeration process can be estimated by the measured NH4 and NO3.<br><br>
Moreover, since the reaction flows from the left side to the right side in the<br>
reaction formula, mutual inverse proportional operation occurs between NH4 and NO3<br>
according to the reaction formula corresponding to the consumption and the production<br>
relationship. That is, O2 consumption reaction over time causes NH4 to be reduced and<br>
NO3 to be increased.<br>
According to the mutual reaction relationship, the required O2 demand can be set<br>
by NH4 and NO3. A load curve for the DO demand is proportional to NH4, while a load<br>
curve for the DO demand is inversely proportional to NO3.<br>
Although the respective load curves are theoretically linear, they are non-linearly<br>
proportional due to real operational conditional parameters such as season, time, load,<br>
water-material component ratio, microorganism activity, water temperature and climate.<br>
Further, the respective non-linear proportional curves are plotted with reference to data<br>
obtained from various empirical operations or initial trial runs for the sewage introduced<br>
into a sewage treatment plant.<br>
Further, the sewage treatment control device 100 may automatically set the target<br>
values based on the component values inspected by the respective measuring units 101 as<br>
described above. The sewage treatment control device 100 may cause the operator to set<br>
the target values voluntarily if there are dramatic conditional changes such as a failure of<br>
the sewage treatment control device 100 or a climate flood. To this end, a manual setting<br>
unit 104 for causing an operator to input the component values directly may be included.<br>
Meanwhile, the sewage treatment control device 100 includes a signal selection<br>
unit 106 for selectively allowing either one of the respective target value setting units 103<br>
or the manual setting unit 104 to be connected. The signal selection unit 106 includes a<br>
selection logic unit 105 for controlling either one of the target value setting units 103,<br>
which has a component value determined to be valid in the respective validity verification<br>
units, or the manual setting unit 105 to be connected.<br>
The selection logic unit 105 selects one of target value setting units 103 whose<br>
validity is verified depending on a predetermined priority ranking. That is, the selection<br>
logic unit 105 inspects a first component value designated as a first priority ranking<br>
according to a sequential logic and if there is no abnormality, selects the first component<br><br>
value. However, if the first component value designated as the first priority ranking is<br>
abnormal, the selection logic unit 105 inspects and selects a second component designated<br>
as a second priority ranking. As described above, the selection logic unit 105 inspects the<br>
respective component values depending on its priority ranking, and if all the component<br>
values are abnormal, the target value is set depending on the setting value inputted by an<br>
operator into the manual setting unit 104.<br>
Further, the sewage treatment control device 100 includes a PID control unit 107<br>
for performing proportional, integral or derivative action for the target value input from the<br>
signal selection unit 106 to convert the target value into a control signal. In addition, the<br>
sewage treatment control device 100 may further include a control compensation unit in<br>
which the target value inputted from the signal selection unit 106 and the measured value<br>
obtained by measuring from the water which has passed through the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus 108 are compared with each other and then the target value to be inputted to the<br>
PID control unit 107 may be compensated.<br>
The control compensation unit includes a final measuring unit 109, which has a<br>
sensor installed to the outlet side of the sewage treatment apparatus 108 to inspect a<br>
specific component of the water, and a comparison unit 110, which is installed to the inlet<br>
side of the PID control unit 107 and compares the specific component value anticipated<br>
from the set target value and the specific component value inspected by the final measuring<br>
unit 109 to correct the target value so that the anticipated specific component value is<br>
converged to the inspected specific component value.<br>
As described above, the sewage treatment control device 100 is capable of rapidly<br>
coping with the occurrence or not of any problem, an environmental change or processing<br>
situation due to newly inflow water, and an external environmental change, so that the<br>
stably treated water quality can be maintained as well as the operational cost can be largely<br>
reduced.<br>
The configuration and operation of the sewage treatment apparatus which is<br>
controlled by the sewage treatment control device 100 as described above will be described<br>
as follows.<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view schematically showing a biological reactor according<br><br>
to the present invention. In addition, Fig. 6 is a view schematically showing the<br>
configuration of a sewage treatment apparatus according to the present invention, and Fig.<br>
7 is a sectional view showing an interior of the biological reactor of the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 to 7, the sewage treatment apparatus 108 is provided with two<br>
biological reactors 210 and 220 (for bulk liquid), which are formed with channels 216 and<br>
226 through which the biological reactors 210 and 220 communicate with each other and<br>
the sewage may flow to each other. In addition, the respective biological reactors 210<br>
and 220 are connected to inflow portions 211, 212, 221 and 222 for causing the sewage to<br>
be introduced through upper and lower ends of the biological reactors 210 and 220 and<br>
discharge portions 214 and 224 for discharging the sewage which is purified through the<br>
respective biological reactors 210 and 220. To this end, the biological reactors 210 and<br>
220 are provided with inflow and discharge ports to be connected to the inflow portions<br>
211, 212, 221 and 222 and the discharge portions 214 and 224, respectively.<br>
Further, the inflow portions 211, 212, 221 and 222 are connected to the upper and<br>
lower ends of the biological reactors 210 and 220, respectively. Opening and closing<br>
units 270 are installed to outlet portions of the inflow portions 211, 212, 221 and 222, so<br>
that an open state of the discharge portions 214 and 224 can be adjusted by the control of<br>
the opening and closing units 270.<br>
Each of the opening and closing units 270 is an electric-powered water gate, and<br>
includes a cylinder 272 provided with a vertically moved rod 274, and a shielding plate<br>
276 connected to the rod 274 of the cylinder 272 to shield the outlet portion of the inflow<br>
portion 211, 212, 221 or 222.<br>
Further, diffusers 230 for supplying air are installed to a lower portion of each<br>
biological reactor 210 or 220. The diffuser 230 selectively supplies air into the biological<br>
reactor 210 or 220, and accordingly, the biological reactor 210 or 220 can be changed to be<br>
one of an anaerobic zone state, an anoxic state and an aerobic state. In addition, the<br>
anaerobic zone state, the anoxic state and the aerobic state may coexist in the biological<br>
reactor 210 or 220 by controlling the injection position of air to be supplied from the<br>
diffuser 230.<br><br>
Further, a plurality of diffusers 230 may be installed. It is preferable that the<br>
diffusers 230 be installed to face the inflow portions 211,212,221 and 222. Accordingly,<br>
the respective diffusers 230 are positioned at the lower portions of the corresponding<br>
inflow portions 211,212, 222 and 222.<br>
In addition, a main air supply piping 232 for supplying air is connected to the<br>
diffuser 230, and a blower 236 is installed to the main air supply piping 232 to supply air.<br>
Further, a valve means 234 for adjusting the amount of the supplied air is installed to a<br>
connection portion between each diffuser 230 and its main air supply piping 232. The<br>
valve means 234 may include an electric needle valve, an electric butterfly valve or an<br>
electric ball valve, and the adjustment of the valve means 234 may cause the amount of air<br>
supplied to each diffuser 230 to be controlled. Accordingly, the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus 108 can block or adjust the supply of air to be supplied to respective portions of<br>
the biological reactors 210 and 220 through the diffusers 230 without suspending the<br>
operation of the blower 236.<br>
Moreover, a flow rate adjustment zone (not shown) for adjusting the flow rate of<br>
the supplied sewage water may be installed to inlet portions of the inflow portions 211,212,<br>
221 and 222 of the biological reactors 210 and 220. Accordingly, a constant flow rate of<br>
the sewage water may be supplied to the biological reactors 210 and 220.<br>
Further, water level adjustment devices 280 for adjusting the closing/opening of<br>
the discharge portions 214 and 224 to change the flow path are installed to the discharge<br>
portions 214 and 224 of the biological reactors 210 and 220. Accordingly, the adjustment<br>
of the water level adjustment device 280 in the biological reactors 210 and 220 may cause<br>
the nitrated sewage in the anoxic (zone) state to gravitationally flow, and therefore, an<br>
internal recycle effect can be obtained with a relatively small power.<br>
The water level adjustment device 280 is to adjust the closing/opening of the<br>
discharge portions 214 and 224 by adjusting the opened height of the discharge portions<br>
214 and 224, and changes the flow path by adjusting the flow rate where the discharge<br>
portions 214 and 224 overflows. To this end, the water level adjustment device 280<br>
includes a closing/opening means for closing its opening and a height adjustment means<br>
for adjusting the height of the closing/opening means.<br><br>
Fig. 8 is a view of the configuration of a modified embodiment of the sewage<br>
treatment apparatus 108 according to the present invention. A primary clarifier 240 for<br>
primarily clarifier foreign materials included in the inflow sewage water may be installed<br>
between the flow rate adjustment zone and the inlet portion of the inflow portions 211,212,<br>
221 and 222. Further, a secondary clarifier 250 for secondarily clarifier foreign materials<br>
included in the treated sewage may be installed to the discharge portions 214 and 224 of<br>
the biological reactors 210 and 220. Here, a plurality of primary clarifier 240 and a<br>
plurality of secondary clarifier 250 may be installed in order to increase the settling<br>
performance of foreign materials.<br>
Meanwhile, the secondary clarifier 250 is equipped with a return channel 255 for<br>
allowing the secondary clarifier 250 to communicate with the inflow portions 211, 212,<br>
221 and 222 of the biological reactors 210 and 220 is, so that the return channel 255 causes<br>
a portion of the sludge settled in the secondary clarifier 250 to be fed back through the<br>
inflow portions 211, 212, 221 and 222 to the biological reactors 210 and 220 and retreated<br>
therein.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 which is a view showing the configuration of a sewage<br>
treatment apparatus 108 according to another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
auxiliary anaerobic zones 218 and 228, into which the inflow sewage and the sludge fed<br>
back from the return channel 255 are introduced, may be installed at front ends of the<br>
biological reactors 210 and 220, respectively. The auxiliary anaerobic zones 218 and 228<br>
for mixing and supplying the sewage and the sludge may preferably be equipped with a<br>
mixer for physically stirring the sewage and the sludge.<br>
In the present invention, the auxiliary anaerobic zones 218 and 228 may be<br>
installed to the sides of the biological reactors 210 and 220, respectively, and one auxiliary<br>
anaerobic zone may be installed to the front ends of the biological reactors 210 and 220 to<br>
allow the sewage and the sludge to be mixed and supplied in a mixed state.<br>
In addition, referring to Fig. 10 which is a view showing the configuration of a<br>
sewage treatment apparatus according to a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
instead of the aforementioned auxiliary anaerobic zones 218 and 228, a mixing and<br>
distributing zone 245 for mixing and distributing the inflow sewage and the return<br><br>
activated sludge may be installed to the front ends of the biological reactors 210 and 220.<br>
A plurality of mixing and distributing zones 245 may be installed, so that the inflow<br>
sewage water and the return activated sludge may be properly mixed and distributed.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 11, the sewage treatment apparatus 108 may further<br>
include filter units 260 within the biological reactors 210 and 220, respectively. The filter<br>
unit 260 is composed of a membrane film and used to filter foreign materials contained in<br>
the sewage to be discharged to thereby prevent foreign materials from being discharged<br>
through the discharge portions 214 and 224. Accordingly, if the filter units 260 are<br>
installed in the biological reactors 210 and 220, settled materials are not included in the<br>
sewage to be discharged, so that the additional secondary clarifier (reference numeral 250<br>
in Figs. 8 to 10) for settling foreign materials may not be installed. Here, although it is<br>
shown in Fig. 11 that a space is formed between the filter unit 260 and the outlet portions<br>
of the biological reactors 210 and 220, this is to show the configuration of the filter unit<br>
260, and accordingly, the filter unit 260 and the outlet portions of the biological reactors<br>
210 and 220 may be in contact with each other.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the sewage treatment apparatus 108 is<br>
provided with a control system which may quickly and flexibly cope with the external<br>
environment and the inflow load amount.<br>
The control system is divided into a water quality monitoring control system and a<br>
tuning system. The water quality monitoring control system analyzes data in real time<br>
according to a control logic which is previously inputted, and manages and controls the<br>
respective control portions. Also, the tuning system is allowed to receive and diagnose<br>
the data and operational results inputted to the water quality monitoring control system,<br>
and monitors and determines whether or not the operation according to the aforementioned<br>
control logic is reasonable. Further, the tuning system performs self simulation using the<br>
input data to implement the understanding for the current operation state and the<br>
anticipation. Further, after the data has been reviewed, the tuning system analyses the<br>
reviewed result to construct a new control logic, transmits the new control logic back to the<br>
water quality monitoring control system, and hereafter allows the water quality monitoring<br>
control system to be operated by the new control logic.<br><br>
As described above, the tuning system is capable of rapidly coping with the<br>
occurrence or not of any problems, environmental change or treatment status due to newly<br>
inputted water quality, and external environmental change, so that the stably treated water<br>
quality can be maintained as well as the operational cost can be largely reduced.<br>
To this end, a measuring sensor for analyzing water quality is installed in each of<br>
the biological reactors 210 and 220, and the data transmitted by the measuring sensor for<br>
analyzing the water quality is inputted to the water quality monitoring control system.<br>
At this time, the water quality monitoring control system inputs the date to the<br>
programmed control logic to automatically control a sector-based state change, a change of<br>
the positions through which the sewage and the sludge are introduced, the adjustment of<br>
the return rate for the sludge, the adjustment of the inflow amount of sewage, and a sector-<br>
based appropriate dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic sectors in the biological<br>
reactors 210 and 220.<br>
Further, the water quality monitoring control system transmits the inputted data<br>
and the resulting values to the tuning system.<br>
The tuning system monitors the operational state of the water quality monitoring<br>
control system according to the data inputted to the water quality monitoring control<br>
system and the resulting values to thereby prevent abnormal operation. Further, the<br>
tuning system performs a simulation for anticipating the operation of the sewage treatment<br>
apparatus 108 according to the inputted data and the resulting values, accordingly<br>
diagnoses and estimates the current state, and then extracts an appropriate control logic.<br>
Fig. 12 is a view showing the configuration of an estimation unit of a tuning<br>
system in the sewage treatment apparatus 108 according to the present invention. The<br>
estimation unit includes a measuring unit, which is composed of sensors for measuring<br>
NH4, NO3, PO4, DO, the ventilation amount, mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), a<br>
flow rate, and the like; controllers for controlling an aerobic/anoxic state, a DO setting<br>
point, a return flow rate, and the like; and actuators controlled to be actuated by the<br>
controller. Here, the aerobic/anoxic state controller is controlled by the information on<br>
NH4, NO3, PO4, DO, and the like, while the DO setting point controller is controlled by the<br>
information on NH4, DO, the ventilation amount, and the like. Further, the return flow<br><br>
rate controller is controlled by the information on the MLSS, the flow rate, and the like.<br>
In addition, each actuator flexibly determines the aerobic/anoxic condition,<br>
determines an appropriate DO value in an aeration sector, or maintains an appropriate<br>
MLSS concentration in a reactor.<br>
As described above, the new control logic extracted according to the simulation<br>
results is transmitted to the water quality monitoring control system to control the water<br>
quality monitoring control system in real time.<br>
In addition to the DO measuring sensor, a hydrogen ion concentration (pH) sensor,<br>
an MLSS sensor, an ammonia nitrogen (NH/-N) sensor, a nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N)<br>
sensor, a phosphate phosphorous (PO4--P) sensor, an oxidation reduction potential (ORP)<br>
sensor, and the like may be additionally installed as the measuring sensors installed in the<br>
biological reactors 210 and 220, and the respective sensors are always connected to the<br>
water quality monitoring control system on-line.<br>
Meanwhile, the water quality monitoring control system, which separately<br>
controls the respective sectors of the biological reactors 210 and 220, is different from the<br>
conventional schemes in that<br>
the dissolved oxygen concentrations in all the aerobic sectors through all the<br>
treatment processes are identically maintained with a constant level (for example, at least<br>
2.0 mg/L) or the air supply amount is controlled according to the occurrence or not of an<br>
aeration process or by a frequency modulation scheme.<br>
In addition, a conventional water quality monitoring system, a control system, an<br>
expert control system, or the like has allowed a manager to directly control the system<br>
through the man &amp; machine interface while it has communicated with a main server<br>
computer installed to the central position based on a conventional supervisory control and<br>
data acquisition (SCADA) which has been used to monitor and control a remotely installed<br>
apparatus and equipment in another remote position (such as the central position); or has<br>
been automatically operated by the previously inputted control logic. If an additional<br>
simulation is integrated, the simulation results would be presented to the operator as the<br>
operation method through a previously inputted similar scenario.<br>
Accordingly, the conventional control system has no scheme capable of checking<br><br>
the occurrence or not of problems, so that a manager directly controls the control system.<br>
This is because the portion required to be controlled in the domestic advanced sewage<br>
treatment scheme is extremely small, so that the need to be controlled may be extremely<br>
low, and even if the real sewage treatment plant control system is installed, it has been no<br>
difference in operational manpower.<br>
Meanwhile, the control system according to the present invention receives the<br>
information inputted from the sensors in real time, and the tuning system is allowed to<br>
produce the optimum control logic even when conditions such as external environmental<br>
changes, flow rate variations, and the like are varied according to the inputted information.<br>
Accordingly, the control system according to the present invention can cope with the<br>
sewage treatment environmental change quickly and flexibly, improve the treatment<br>
efficiency of organic materials, nitrogen and phosphorous to maintain the stable treated<br>
water quality, and reduce operational manpower to thereby reduce maintenance and<br>
management costs.<br>
Referring to Figs. 13 (a) to (d) which show an application example of the sewage<br>
treatment apparatus 108 according to the present invention, the sewage treatment method<br>
according to the present invention will be described as follows.<br>
First of all, as shown in Fig. 13 (a), the sewage and return activated sludge is<br>
introduced into the lower end of the first biological reactor 210. The sewage and return<br>
activated sludge is introduced into the first biological reactor 210 under an anaerobic state<br>
where air is not supplied. At this time, the sewage and return activated sludge has not<br>
been completely mixed , so that it is moved in a plug-flow type. In addition, a middle<br>
portion and the upper end of the first biological reactor 210 are converted into an anoxic<br>
state.<br>
Meanwhile, the second biological reactor 220 maintains the aerobic state and<br>
discharges the completely treated sewage.<br>
Then, if a predetermined time goes by, the inflow of the sewage into the first<br>
biological reactor 210 stops as shown in Fig. 13 (b). Then, the sewage and return<br>
activated sludge is introduced into the upper end of the second biological reactor 210 220.<br>
At this time, the upper and lower ends and the middle portion of the first biological reactor<br><br>
210 are supplied with air, so that they may be converted into an aerobic state.<br>
Meanwhile, the upper and lower ends and the middle portion of the second<br>
biological reactor 220 are not supplied with air, so that they may be converted into an<br>
anoxic state to discharge the treated sewage.<br>
Then, if a predetermined time goes by, the inflow of the sewage and return<br>
activated sludge into the upper end of the second biological reactor 220 is blocked as<br>
shown in Fig. 13 (c) while the sewage and return activated sludge is introduced into the<br>
lower end of the second biological reactor 220. At this time, the sewage and return<br>
activated sludge has not been completely mixed , so that it is moved in a plug-flow type.<br>
In addition, the middle portion and the upper end of the second biological reactor 220 are<br>
converted into an anoxic state. Further, the first biological reactor 210 is converted into<br>
an aerobic state, and the completely treated sewage is discharged.<br>
Then, if a predetermined time goes by, the inflow of the sewage into the lower<br>
end of the second biological reactor 220 is blocked as shown in Fig. 13 (d). Then, the<br>
sewage and return activated sludge is introduced into the upper end of the first biological<br>
reactor 210.<br>
At this time, the upper and lower ends and the middle portion of the first<br>
biological reactor 210 are converted into an anoxic state. Then, the completely treated<br>
sewage is discharged. Further, the upper and lower ends and the middle portion of the<br>
second biological reactor 220 are converted into an aerobic state.<br>
As described above, the treatment time for the respective stages is changed<br>
depending on the load of the inflow sewage water, and it is possible to increase the<br>
treatment time for the respective stages or to omit the respective stages.<br>
Meanwhile, in the stage before the sewage is introduced into the biological<br>
reactors 210 and 220, the biological reactors 210 and 220 are maintained in the aerobic<br>
state and remove organic material therefrom. Further, through a nitrification process in<br>
which ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) is converted into nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), the sewage<br>
and return activated sludge to be treated is introduced with nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N)<br>
accumulated therein and a diffusion process is performed. At the same time, a<br>
denitrification process for nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) is performed.<br><br>
Meanwhile, referring to the Manual Nitrogen Control (993) proposed by EPA, a<br>
main factor in a denitrification process is a ratio of food to microorganism, an F/M ratio,<br>
and a specific denitrification rate (SDNR) and an F/M ratio are proportional with each<br>
other.<br>
Conventionally, the SDNR may be equal to the sum of 0.03 times the F/M ratio<br>
and 0.029 as expressed in Equation 1:<br><br>
Accordingly, the sewage and the sludge react with each other under the complete<br>
mixing state in a conventional A2/O, intermittent aeration or SBR method, the amount of<br>
organic materials (F) in the inflow water is reduced while the amount of microorganism<br>
(M) is constant, so that the low F/M ratio may be maintained. Accordingly, as a carbon<br>
source is deficient, the carbon source is preferentially used in bioaccumulation or cell<br>
synthesis rather than an actual denitrification process, so that the elongated hydraulic<br>
retention time has been required in order to improve the denitrification efficiency since the<br>
carbon source has been absolutely deficient.<br>
On the contrary, in order to maintain the F/M ratio constantly at a high level, the<br>
present system controls the amount of the return activated sludge, so that the return<br>
activated sludge may be mixed with the inflow water or introduced into another position<br>
which is different from that of the inflow water, thereby maintaining the high F/M ratio by<br>
controlling the MLSS in an anoxic state. The activated sludge in the biological reactors<br>
210 and 220 is appropriately mixed with the sewage in the biological reactors 210 and 220<br>
without being completely settled in the biological reactors 210 and 220, so that it may be<br>
diffused in an ideal plug-flow type. Accordingly, the activated sludge is in contact with a<br>
large quantity of nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) in the biological reactors 210 and 220 using the<br>
inflow sewage, so that the denitrification process can be performed.<br>
At this time, the high F/M ratio causes the denitrification process to be performed<br><br>
more quickly than the complete mix reaction, so that the hydraulic retention time in the<br>
anoxic (zone) state can be dramatically reduced. The most important control factor in the<br>
process is a dissolved oxygen concentration in an aerobic state before the introducing stage<br>
and a scheme for preventing microorganism from being settled in the time point from<br>
which air is not supplied and in an anaerobic/anoxic state. It is generally known that if<br>
the dissolved oxygen concentration in the biological reactors 210 and 220 is not smaller<br>
than 0.2 mg/L, oxygen is actuated as an electron receiver, so that the actual denitrification<br>
process may not be performed. Accordingly, if a high dissolved oxygen concentration is<br>
maintained in an aerobic state, a large amount of time is required between the time point<br>
from which air is no more supplied and the time point in which the dissolved oxygen<br>
concentration is reduced smaller than or equal to 0.2 mg/L.<br>
Specifically, a contact ratio between microorganisms and various pollutant<br>
materials in the biological reactors 210 and 220 is dramatically reduced since the stirring<br>
operation is not performed, so that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the biological<br>
reactors 210 and 220 cannot be reduced smaller than or equal to 0.2 mg/L.<br>
Further, if the dissolved oxygen concentration maintains to be not smaller than 0.2<br>
mg/L, organic materials in the inflow water are coupled with the oxygen in the biological<br>
reactors 210 and 220, so that organic materials required to the denitrification process is<br>
remarkably deficient, and therefore, the denitrication rate has had no choice but to be<br>
maintained very low. Due to the aforementioned problem, the dissolved oxygen<br>
concentration in the aerobic state is maintained to be not smaller than 2.0 mg/L, and<br>
therefore, a large amount of the organic material introduced after the time point from<br>
which air is not supplied may not be used to perform the denitrification process, the<br>
anaerobic/aerobic scheme according to the time control scheme in a conventional<br>
intermittent air supply process represents very low nitrogen removing efficiency.<br>
In order to solve these problems, an on-line dissolved oxygen measuring sensor is<br>
installed to each sector of the diffusers 230 which are separately installed to the lower<br>
portions of the biological reactors 210 and 220. In addition to the on-line dissolved<br>
oxygen measuring sensor, an on-line pH sensor, an MLSS sensor, an ammonia nitrogen<br>
(NH4+-N) sensor, a nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) sensor, a phosphate phosphorous (PO4--P)<br><br>
sensor, an oxidation reduction potential (ORP) sensor, and the like may be further installed<br>
to monitor a state of the biological reactors 210 and 220. At this time, according to the<br>
preset values, the water quality monitoring system separately controls the occurrence or<br>
not of aeration process and a dissolved oxygen concentration in the respective aerobic<br>
states using the concentrations of the respective pollutant materials measured in real time.<br>
At this time, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic states are maintained in the<br>
range of 0.5 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L, but the respective dissolved oxygen concentrations in all<br>
the aerobic states are different from each other.<br>
The actual limitation factor in the nitrification process is the maximum specific<br>
growth rate µN of microorganism, which is influenced by temperature. Such a fact may<br>
be known from the Manual Nitrogen Control (1993)(µN = 0.47e0.098(temperature-15)) which has<br>
been proposed by EPA.<br>
Accordingly, by injecting the minimum amount of air required to an oxidation and<br>
nitrification process of organic materials, unnecessary energy can be cut down to reduce<br>
operation cost.<br>
The conventional sewage treatment methods have strictly prevented air from<br>
being supplied since air supply in an anaerobic or anoxic (zone) state causes the<br>
nitrification efficiency to be reduced. Further, in order to maintain the dissolved oxygen<br>
concentration in the biological reactor to be smaller than or equal to 0.2 mg/L, the<br>
conventional sewage treatment methods have maintained a mixer at a low speed, so that an<br>
increase of the dissolved oxygen concentration due to a re-aeration process on a surface of<br>
the biological reactor might have been prevented.<br>
However, this is because the dissolved oxygen concentration in an anaerobic or<br>
anoxic state increases due to the dissolved oxygen included in the internal recycle water,<br>
and therefore, if the dissolved oxygen concentration in the internal recycle water is<br>
maintained to be low and air is instantaneously introduced, the dissolved oxygen<br>
concentration in the biological reactor does not increase.<br>
Therefore, since the microorganisms in the biological reactor in an<br>
anaerobic/anoxic state are quickly settled in the present sewage treatment method, the<br>
contact rate of the microorganisms with the nitrite nitrogen in the biological reactor 210<br><br>
and 220 may be reduced. Accordingly, a small amount of air is instantaneously supplied<br>
through the diffusers located at the lower portions according to the microorganism<br>
concentration in biological reactor which has been previously set in the monitoring system,<br>
so that the microorganisms can be prevented from being quickly settled.<br>
At this time, in order to prevent the plug-flow from being disintegrated due to the<br>
air supply in an anaerobic/anoxic state, air is sequentially supplied through only some lines<br>
of the installed diffusers rather than the whole lower aeration, and if the high-concentrated<br>
microorganisms are secured, so that when the sludge is little settled, air may not be<br>
supplied.<br>
The air supply is primarily controlled using the monitoring system, and the tuning<br>
system determines whether or not the air supply is controlled.<br>
The sewage treatment control device and method and the sewage treatment<br>
system using the same according to the presenting invention as described above have<br>
advantages, in that when a sensor in a measuring unit is abnormally operated, it may be<br>
appreciated whether or not a measured value from the sensor is abnormal; when an<br>
expensive measuring unit for measuring a specific component is out of order, an<br>
inexpensive measuring unit for measuring another specific component can be used to<br>
convert a target value, so that the expensive measuring unit can be replaced with the<br>
inexpensive measuring unit, thereby dramatically reducing the installation cost for the<br>
measuring units; the number of measuring units can be minimized, whereby the<br>
maintenance can be easily performed; the occurrence of failure can be minimized; and<br>
although any one of the measuring units is out of order, another measuring unit can be used<br>
to perform the measurement continuously, so that there is no need to be manually operated,<br>
thereby being capable of securely and precisely controlling the sewage treatment process.<br>
In addition, the present invention can be commonly applied to the sewage treatment<br>
process; implement the best control conditions; and minimize the maintenance time and the<br>
maintenance manpower associated therewith to thereby reduce a budget. Further, when<br>
an activated sludge method is modified into an advanced treatment construction, the<br>
present invention need not install additional internal partition walls, thereby dramatically<br>
reducing a construction interval and preventing the neighboring river from being polluted<br><br>
during the construction interval. Furthermore, the respective biological reactors can be<br>
converted into an anaerobic state, an anoxic state and an aerobic state, and the respective<br>
states may coexist, so that the space applicability is excellent. Moreover, the dissolved<br>
oxygen concentrations in the respective sectors in an aerobic state can be separately<br>
controlled in a region of 0.5 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L, so that the operational cost can be reduced.<br>
In addition, a portion through which sewage is introduced is maintained in an anoxic state<br>
of a plug-flow type, so that the denitrification rate is improved, and therefore, the high-<br>
level denitrification may cause a phosphorous emission rate to be improved. Further,<br>
using a water level adjustment apparatus capable of adjusting an opened height of a<br>
discharge port without additionally using both the stir and the internal recycle by an<br>
internal recycle pump, the operation cost can be dramatically reduced. Also, an on-line<br>
water quality measuring unit is installed in the biological reactor, so that the water quality<br>
in the biological reactor can be checked in real time. The water quality monitoring<br>
control system for controlling the biological reactor depending on the previously inputted<br>
control logic is installed, and the tuning system for monitoring, controlling, diagnosing and<br>
anticipating an operational state of the water quality monitoring control system is used to<br>
manage the water quality monitoring control system, so that the operation efficiency of the<br>
sewage treatment apparatus can be improved.<br>
Although the sewage treatment control device and method according to the<br>
present invention is described with reference to the illustrated drawings, the scope of the<br>
present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and the drawings. It<br>
will be apparent that those skilled in the art can make various modifications and changes<br>
