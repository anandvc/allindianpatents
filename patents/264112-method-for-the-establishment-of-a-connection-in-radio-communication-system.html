ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONNECTION IN RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
The invention relates to a method for the establishment of a<br>
connection in radio communication systems, particularly in<br>
mobile radio systems, and to components of the radio<br>
communication system for carrying out the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
A continuously rising number of different radio communication<br>
systems, to mention only the systems according to the familiar<br>
GSM, IS-95, UMTS, CDMA2000, WLAN, WiMAX, etc. standards, for<br>
example, leads to user terminals also supporting an ever<br>
increasing number of these systems or standards and, as a<br>
result, providing the user with access to communication<br>
networks in the most varied manner. In addition, operators of<br>
radio communication systems are increasingly providing their<br>
customers with systems of different standards, with the<br>
possibility of roaming between these systems.<br>
However, all this can disadvantageously lead to the period for<br>
establishing a connection by a user terminal being extended due<br>
to the large selection of available systems which, in addition,<br>
operate in different system-specific frequency bands, as a<br>
rule. If, for example, the user wishes to use a high-data-rate<br>
service, to mention video streaming as an example, such a<br>
service can be potentially provided by different systems. If no<br>
specific system has been preselected by the user, the user<br>
terminal, during the establishment of the connection,<br>
establishes contact to various systems or, respectively, the<br>
user terminal first attempts to receive signals from different<br>
systems - for example of the same operator - and then to select<br>
a system suitable for the selected service.<br><br>
Especially when the user terminal is taken into operation at a<br>
location which it has previously not maintained a connection to<br>
a system and can thus not make use of empirical values, for<br>
example if the user is located in a foreign country after a<br>
flight, an additional aggravating factor which may extend the<br>
access time is that the local operator is not known, with whom<br>
the home operator has concluded a so-called roaming agreement<br>
in order to provide lowered connection charges to the customer.<br>
In this case, a local system or operator may be proposed to the<br>
user a number of times, with which the user must then decide<br>
whether a connection establishment is to take place or not.<br>
From DE 197 34 933 C1, a method is known in which a mobile<br>
station located in a radio coverage area of a mobile radio<br>
network generates an adaptation to an air interface access<br>
method of the mobile radio network by signaling information<br>
transmitted on a pilot channel. In this context, the pilot<br>
channel is transmitted by at least one broadcast transmitting<br>
station of a public broadcasting system in the radio coverage<br>
area of the mobile radio network and received and evaluated by<br>
the mobile station.<br>
To provide an overview of the increasing number of systems for<br>
users or user terminals, it has already been proposed, inter<br>
alia in the document "Global Pilot Mechanism" Tdoc SMG2 UMTS<br>
52/97, ETSI STC SMG2 UMTS adhoc, April 8-10,  1997,  Lulea,<br>
Sweden, pages 1 and 2, to introduce a globally uniform pilot<br>
channel (Global Pilot Channel) on a uniform frequency channel<br>
or in a uniform frequency spectrum. On such a global pilot<br>
channel, information about the respective locally available<br>
radio access technologies (Radio Access Technology Indicator)<br>
and references (Spectral Pointers) to their spectral position<br>
should be transmitted so that a user terminal can select and<br>
access a suitable or supported radio access technology.<br><br>
Radio access technologies are understood to be systems of<br>
different standards, for example GSM and UMTS which operate in<br>
different frequency bands. According to the above document, the<br>
pilot channel should be sent out either by the operators<br>
themselves which would correspondingly also have to send out<br>
information by competing operators, or by a national entity not<br>
specified in greater detail, for example the regulating<br>
authority.<br><br><br><br>
However, such a uniform pilot channel has the disadvantage that<br>
with the rising number of different systems and their expansion<br>
to a greater number of frequency bands, the signaling load<br>
would also rise continuously. In addition, the administrative<br>
effort for acquiring and sending out information of the<br>
different systems appears to be comparatively large.<br>
Furthermore, a user terminal, after having been referred to the<br>
frequency spectrum, for example of the GSM mobile radio system,<br>
by means of the pilot channel, would still have to perform a<br>
large number of measurements of networks of different operators<br>
in order to find an operator network which is suitable for the<br>
desired service or the desired tariff or contract.<br>
It is the object of the invention, therefore, to specify a<br>
method, a system and system components which enable a user<br>
terminal to establish a connection setup to a desired radio<br>
communication system or network in a simple and quick manner.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of the independent<br>
patent claims. Advantageous embodiments of the invention can be<br>
found in dependent patent claims.<br>
According to the invention, a user terminal selects an operator<br>
on the basis of information on at least one operator of a radio<br>
communication system in a country-specific pilot channel.<br>
Following this, the user terminal selects a radio communication<br>
system on the basis of information on at least one radio<br>
communication system in an operator-specific pilot channel of<br>
the selected operator and, finally, carries out an access to<br>
the selected radio communication system for the establishment<br>
of a connection.<br>
Advantageously, the hierarchical structure of the pilot<br>
channels according to the invention and a corresponding<br>
subdivision of the information in each case transmitted in the<br>
pilot channels provides for a simpler and more flexible<br>
administration of the contents of<br><br>
the pilot channels compared with the method of the prior art,<br>
described by way of the introduction. Thus, for example, a<br>
change of the systems or networks supported by an operator does<br>
not require any change in the content of the country-specific<br>
pilot channel which, if necessary, is administered by a higher-<br>
level entity, for example a national regulating authority.<br>
Advantageously, the respective operator can also dynamically<br>
change, for example the assignment of physical resources to the<br>
individual systems or networks in the sense of a dynamic<br>
resource assignment in the pilot channel allocated to him, for<br>
example in order to optimize a load distribution in the systems<br>
or networks. In this context, the content of the operator-<br>
specific pilot channel is advantageously configured, for<br>
example, by the operator himself, for example by means of a<br>
correspondingly designed operation and maintenance function<br>
(O&amp;M). If a number of operators use the same frequency<br>
spectrum, the current use and its corresponding signaling<br>
should preferably take place in agreement with one another on<br>
the operator-specific pilot channels.<br>
In the same manner, the user terminal is advantageously enabled<br>
to pass through a uniform connection setup procedure in order<br>
to carry out a quick establishment of a connection to a desired<br>
system or network independently of its current location.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, a<br>
reference to at least the operator-specific pilot channel is<br>
transmitted as information in the country-specific pilot<br>
channel. By means of this information, the user terminal can<br>
directly access the operator-specific pilot channel. The same<br>
applies to another development according to which a reference<br>
to at least one system-specific pilot channel of the at least<br>
one radio communication system is transmitted as information in<br>
the operator-specific pilot channel.<br><br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the method according<br>
to the invention, information of a synchronization channel,<br>
control channel and/or pilot channel is transmitted in the<br>
system-specific pilot channel. In this context, the information<br>
is dependent on the respective configuration of the radio<br>
interface or the radio transmission standard, respectively, and<br>
can have a different content in dependence on the system or<br>
standard.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the at least one operator-<br>
specific pilot channel and the at least one system-specific<br>
pilot channel are sent out by at least one radio access device<br>
of the at least one radio communication system. This has the<br>
advantageous effect that the number of devices involved in the<br>
sending out of the pilot channels is limited. According to a<br>
further development, the country-specific pilot channel is also<br>
sent out by at least one radio access device of the at least one<br>
radio communication system and/or a broadcast transmitting<br>
station of a public or private broadcasting system. Using<br>
broadcast transmitting stations offers the advantage that, by<br>
using facilities which are already in existence, large<br>
geographic areas can be covered with one radio cell. In this<br>
context, long transit times which may be due to the size of the<br>
radio cell do not have a negative effect since the signal<br>
transmission is exclusively in the downward direction, i.e. in<br>
the direction of the user terminals.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, information<br>
on operators, with whom the at least one operator maintains<br>
national and/or international roaming agreements, is<br>
additionally transmitted in the country-specific pilot channel.<br>
This enables a user terminal which is located outside its own<br>
network to obtain in a simple manner an overview of the locally<br>
available operators and finally to select one operator.<br>
According to a further development, the<br><br><br>
information  on  operators  with  roaming  agreements  can  be<br>
transmitted in specific frames<br><br><br>
within a sequence of frames of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, finally, a<br>
reconfigurability of the user terminal by means of a<br>
transmission of information with respect to a system-specific<br>
configuration of the user terminal in the operator-specific<br>
pilot channel is supported, as a result of which the user<br>
terminal can be advantageously adapted to the radio access<br>
method of the selected system even before an access to the<br>
system.<br>
The system according to the invention and system components in<br>
each case have devices according to the invention by means of<br>
which the method according to the invention can be realized.<br>
In the text which follows, the invention will be presented in<br>
greater detail by means of an exemplary embodiment, in which:<br>
figure 1  shows  a  representation  of  coverage  areas  of<br>
respective pilot channels,<br>
figure 2  shows a representation of the hierarchical structure<br>
of the pilot channels and their contents,<br>
figure 3  shows a flowchart of an access of a user terminal to<br>
a system,<br>
figure 4  shows a sequence of frames of a country-specific<br>
pilot channel,<br>
figures 5a, 5b show structures of frames with information with<br>
respect to operators with roaming agreements,<br>
figure 6  shows the structure of an operator-specific frame<br>
with a subfield for reconfigurable terminals, and<br>
figure 7  shows a representation of system components.<br>
Figure 1 shows by way of example the respective coverage areas<br>
of the pilot channels according to the invention. It shall be<br><br><br>
assumed in this context that a country-specific pilot channel<br>
C-CPC (Country level Common Pilot Channel) radiates information<br><br>
channel C-CPC by means of broadcast transmitting stations, it<br>
can also be sent out by the systems of the operators<br>
themselves.<br>
Apart  from  the  first  operator  0P1	operating  nationwide,<br>
figure 1 also shows by way of example	the coverage area of a<br>
second, locally operating operator 0P2	with three radio cells<br>
of a wireless access system according	to the so-called WiMAX<br>
standard (IEEE 802.16).<br>
Furthermore, a user terminal UE which is located in the<br>
coverage area of systems and networks both of the first<br>
operator OP1 and of the second operator OP2, and is thus<br>
potentially capable of establishing a connection to each of<br>
these systems, is shown by way of example. For subsequent<br>
explanations it shall be assumed that the user terminal UE is<br>
technically constructed to support the three standards<br>
mentioned by way of example, wherein the method can be<br>
similarly carried out for user terminals which only support one<br>
of the standards.<br>
In the exemplary situation of figure 1, it shall also be<br>
assumed that the user terminal UE is switched on or taken into<br>
operation for the first time. This occurs, for example, after<br>
the purchase of the terminal by the user or after arrival at<br>
the airport after a trip from another country. To establish a<br>
first contact to a system operating at the location of the user<br>
terminal, the user terminal will first tune itself to the<br>
frequency band of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC,<br>
receive it and evaluate information contained therein and then<br>
select a suitable or predetermined operator, for example on the<br>
basis of operator information or roaming agreements of<br>
operators stored in the SIM card. As mentioned before, the<br>
frequency band and the access technology of the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC is preferably known per se to the<br><br>
user terminal UE so that the country-specific pilot channel<br>
C-CPC can be selectively and rapidly accessed.<br><br>
On the basis of the information contained in the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC, the user terminal UE thus selects<br>
a suitable or predetermined operator and subsequently tunes the<br>
receiving device to the operator-specific pilot channel of the<br>
selected operator by means of a reference contained in the<br>
information of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC.<br>
A cellular structure, described above, of the country-specific<br>
pilot channel advantageously enables regional or local<br>
peculiarities to be taken into consideration and, as a result,<br>
to limit the volume of information to be transmitted in the<br>
pilot channel. Thus, for example, in the case where an operator<br>
operates in a locally limited way and thus exclusively in one<br>
particular one of the multiplicity of cells of the country-<br>
specific pilot channel, information and a reference to this<br>
operator could be sent out exclusively in this cell whereas no<br>
information whatsoever relating to this operator is sent out in<br>
all other cells of the country-specific pilot channel in which<br>
this operator is not operating. This would correspondingly<br>
apply if an operator, for example, operates wireless access<br>
networks exclusively in metropolitan areas. In this case, it<br>
would be sufficient that only the cells of the country-specific<br>
pilot channel which comprise the metropolitan areas affected<br>
send out information and references to this operator.<br>
In the operator-specific pilot channel, in turn, information<br>
with respect to the systems and networks supported by the<br>
operator is transmitted so that the user terminal UE can<br>
subsequently select and access a suitable system or network,<br>
respectively. The user terminal UE is preferably again referred<br>
to the selected system or network by means of a reference to a<br>
system-specific pilot channel, synchronization channel or<br>
control channel contained in the information of the operator-<br>
specific pilot channel. In the text which follows, the term<br>
pilot channel will be used as synonym for<br><br>
such system-specific channels. In this context, the operator-<br>
specific pilot channel is transmitted, corresponding to the<br>
country-specific pilot channel, preferably in a uniform<br>
frequency band, for example in a subfrequency band of the<br>
country-specific pilot channel in order to provide for rapid<br>
access by the user terminal wherein, as an alternative, a<br>
limited number of frequency bands also appears to be possible<br>
and appropriate, in turn.<br>
Figure 2 shows by way of example the hierarchical structure<br>
according to the invention of the pilot channels and a<br>
respective exemplary frame structure, referring to the<br>
situation of figure 1.<br>
The country-specific pilot channel C-CPC is composed, for<br>
example, of the several subfields of different content, shown<br>
in figure 2, wherein these subfields can also be transmitted in<br>
a different order in the sense of the invention. Together, the<br>
subfields produce a frame which is sent out periodically as<br>
mentioned above, for example by broadcast transmitting stations<br>
or operator stations.<br>
The beginning of a frame is identified by a start field or<br>
starting sequence Start. This Start field can contain<br>
information about the identity of the pilot channel, for<br>
example with regard to the fact that this is a country-specific<br>
pilot channel, in contrast to an operator-specific pilot<br>
channel, but also a synchronization sequence which enables a<br>
user terminal to synchronize itself to the transmission in the<br>
pilot channel, and for detecting the beginning of a respective<br>
frame.<br>
In a second subfield, following the start field start, of the<br>
country-specific pilot channel C-CPC, a country code (CC) is<br>
preferably transmitted on the basis of which the receiving user<br>
terminal UE can identify the country<br><br>
in the territorial field of which it is currently located. This<br>
country code CC can be used by the user terminal, for example,<br>
for matching it with information, stored on the SIM card or an<br>
integrated memory, relating to operators of this country, for<br>
example with respect to existing roaming agreements.<br>
Following the second subfield of the country code CC,<br>
information info with respect to the operators OP1, OP2, ...,<br>
OPn operating in the coverage area of the country-specific<br>
pilot channel C-CPC, including a respective reference to the<br>
operator-specific pilot channel or channels OP1-CPC, OP2-CPC,<br>
..., OPn-CPC (Operator level Common Pilot Channel) is<br>
transmitted in respective subfields. This information enables<br>
the user terminal UE, after evaluation and the abovementioned<br>
matching, to select a suitable operator, the first operator 0P1<br>
in the example of figure 2, and to directly access the pilot<br>
channel or channels OP1-CPC of this selected first operator OP1<br>
by means of the reference.<br>
Finally, a frame of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC is<br>
preferably concluded by a subfield with an end sequence End. In<br>
the case of a periodic repetition of the transmission of the<br>
frame and unambiguous identifiability of the beginning of a<br>
frame by means of the start field, however, a transmission of<br>
the subfield of the end sequence End can also be omitted,<br>
however.<br>
At the hierarchy level of the operator, a corresponding frame<br>
structure of a pilot channel is used but with at least<br>
partially different content of the subfields. The operator-<br>
specific pilot channel is also preferably periodically<br>
repeatedly sent out. Figure 2 shows by way of example the frame<br>
structure of the operator-specific pilot channel OPl-CPC of the<br>
first operator 0P1 selected by the user terminal UE.<br><br>
Since, as a rule, the operator-specific pilot channel OP1-CPC<br>
is sent out in a frequency band disjoint from the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC, an identification of the<br>
beginning of a respective frame by means of a start field Start<br>
is again appropriate. Corresponding to the described field of<br>
the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC, this Start field can<br>
again contain information about the identity of the pilot<br>
channel, for example with regard to the fact that this is an<br>
operator-specific pilot channel, in contrast to the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC, but also a synchronization<br>
sequence which enables a user terminal to synchronize itself to<br>
the transmissions in the pilot channel. A frame of the<br>
operator-specific pilot channel OPl-CPC is preferably again<br>
ended by a subfield with an end sequence End, wherein in the<br>
case of a periodic repetition of the transmission of the frame<br>
and unambiguous identifiability of the beginning of a frame by<br>
means of the start field, a transmission of the subfield of the<br>
end sequence End may be omitted, if necessary.<br>
As an alternative to utilizing a frequency band which is<br>
disjoint from the frequency band of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel, for transmitting the operator-specific pilot channels,<br>
a common frequency spectrum can also be advantageously used,<br>
wherein the individual pilot channels can be separated, for<br>
example, by means of a respective assignment of one or more<br>
subfrequency bands in the sense of an FDMA (Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access) separation and/or by means of further known<br>
methods such as,  for example, TDMA (Time Division Multiple<br>
Access) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). In the same<br>
manner, pilot channels can be separated at the country or<br>
operator level if an identical frequency band is used for<br>
transmissions in adjacent cells.<br>
In a subfield following the start field Start, for example, an<br>
operator code (OPC) is transmitted<br><br>
by means of which the user terminal UE or another user terminal<br>
accessing this pilot channel OP1-CPC can identify the first<br>
operator 0P1.<br>
In subfields following the subfield of the operator code OPC,<br>
information info with respect to the systems or system<br>
technologies RAT1, RAT2, ..., RATn (Radio Access Technology)<br>
available in the coverage area of the operator-specific pilot<br>
channel OP1-CPC including a respective reference to the system<br>
specific pilot or control channel or channels RAT1-BCH, RAT2-<br>
PCH, ..., RATn-BCH is transmitted. This information enables the<br>
user terminal UE, after evaluation and matching with its own<br>
technical capabilities, for example with the support of only a<br>
number of the available system technologies, to select a<br>
suitable system.<br>
In accordance with the example of figure 1, the user terminal<br>
UE would receive information relating to the systems according<br>
to the UMTS and WLAN standard, operated in the coverage area of<br>
the pilot channel OPl-CPC, in the pilot channel OPl-CPC of the<br>
first operator 0P1, and, for example, select the UMTS system<br>
for a first access with the aim of the establishment of a<br>
connection. Correspondingly, it shall be assumed in figure 2<br>
that the UMTS system is represented by the first system<br>
technology RAT1 being specified. Since the user terminal UE is<br>
thus currently located in the coverage area of a radio cell of<br>
the UMTS system, an access to this system is possible after<br>
evaluation of the reference to the control channel of the UMTS<br>
system RATl-BCH. For this purpose, a frame of a control channel<br>
of the UMTS system RATl-BCH is shown by way of example on the<br>
next hierarchical level, i.e. at the system level, in figure 2.<br>
Should the user terminal UE select the WLAN system, however, in<br>
the situation shown in figure 1, which is represented by the<br>
RAT2 system, technology in figure 2 by way of example, it could<br>
RAT2 system technology in figure 2 by way of example, it could<br><br>
not access this pilot channel after evaluation of the reference<br>
to the pilot channel of the WLAN system RAT2-PCH<br><br>
since it is currently located outside the coverage area of a<br>
radio cell of the WLAN system. In this case, the user terminal<br>
UE, after determining that a reception of the pilot channel of<br>
the WLAN system RAT2-PCH is not possible, will select, by again<br>
accessing the operator-specific pilot channel OP1-CPC, an<br>
alternative system, for example the UMTS system identified by<br>
the first system technology RAT1 and then access the latter. If<br>
this newly selected system is not receivable by the user<br>
terminal UE, either, and/or the selected operator does not<br>
operate an alternative system which can be used by the user<br>
terminal UE, the user terminal UE can again access the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC and select a new operator.<br>
The operator-specific pilot channel OP1-CPC with information<br>
relating to the systems operated by the respective operator<br>
advantageously enables the operator to be able to control, for<br>
example, a load distribution between the individual systems.<br>
Thus, according to the example of figures 1 and 2, the first<br>
operator 0P1, in the case of a full loading or overloading of<br>
the WLAN system, could suppress the transmission of information<br>
to this system in the pilot channel OP1-CPC, and thus the<br>
potential access of user terminals to this system until a load<br>
situation is restored which allows further connections to be<br>
accepted. As an alternative, the current load situations of the<br>
individual operated systems can also be signaled to the user<br>
terminals by means of specific information, for example by<br>
means of a status indicator in the information info with<br>
respect to the system technology.<br>
It also appears possible to indicate the distribution of<br>
physical resources by changing the information in the subfields<br>
of the operator-specific pilot channel in order to achieve, for<br>
example, a load balance between systems. If, for example, two<br>
systems use a common frequency band within a coverage area,<br><br>
a  corresponding  reference	to  a  pilot  or  control  channel<br>
belonging to this frequency	band is signaled in the subfield in<br>
dependence on which of the	two systems is currently using the<br>
frequency band.<br>
As a supplement to the references, described above, in the<br>
country-specific and the operator-specific pilot channels to<br>
the pilot and control channels of the next lower hierarchy<br>
level in each case, it may be appropriate also to accommodate a<br>
reference to the next higher hierarchy level of the pilot<br>
channels. In the example of figure 2, the control channel<br>
RAT1-BCH of the UMTS system could thus similarly contain a<br>
reference to the pilot channel OP1-CPC of the first operator<br>
OP1. By means of this reference, a user terminal UE which<br>
maintains an active connection to the UMTS system could<br>
directly access the pilot channel of the operator OP1-CPC, for<br>
example for preparing an intersystem call forwarding or the<br>
establishment of an additional service.<br>
In the text which follows, different procedures of the access<br>
according to the invention of a user terminal to the different<br>
pilot channels or control channels, respectively, are described<br>
with reference to the flowchart of figure 3, shown by way of<br>
example.<br>
Firstly, a first exemplary procedure is described on the basis<br>
of the situation that the user terminal UE has no knowledge<br>
whatsoever about available systems. This situation occurs, for<br>
example, when the user terminal is taken into operation the<br>
first time or switched on after a trip outside the homeland.<br>
After switch-on or startup, step 0, of the user terminal UE, it<br>
will first look for a country-specific pilot channel C-CPC for<br>
establishing a connection to a network or system, step 1. If,<br>
as explained above, country-specific pilot channels C-CPC are<br>
globally<br><br>
sent out in one or more uniform frequency bands, the user<br>
terminal UE will tune its receiving device to this frequency<br>
band or scan the possible frequency bands for signals of a<br>
country-specific pilot channel C-CPC. The frequency band or<br>
bands used for the country-specific pilot channel are known to<br>
the user terminal UE, for example by the storage of relevant<br>
information on the SIM card of the user or a memory of the user<br>
terminal. Thus, the transmission method used for the<br>
transmission of the pilot channel, for example the coding,<br>
modulation, etc., is known to the user terminal UE, so that<br>
fast detection and subsequent reception of a country-specific<br>
pilot channel C-CPC by the user terminal UE is possible. In the<br>
case of a receiving device designed exclusively for the<br>
reception of country-specific pilot channels, for example an<br>
RDS (Radio Data System) receiver for public broadcast systems,<br>
such information is correspondingly not required or only<br>
limited to the transmission method.<br>
After receiving and evaluating, step 2, of the information<br>
transmitted in the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC, the<br>
user terminal UE first selects a suitable operator, step 3.<br>
This is done in accordance with the methods described above<br>
with respect to figures 1 and 2. After evaluation of the<br>
country code CC transmitted in the country-specific pilot<br>
channel C-CPC, the user terminal UE knows, for example, whether<br>
it is located in the coverage area of its home operator or if<br>
it must take into consideration roaming agreements between the<br>
home operator and foreign operators for the selection of an<br>
operator available at the current location of the user<br>
terminal. For this purpose, for example, matching with<br>
information stored on the SIM card with respect to the home<br>
operator and his roaming partner is carried out. If no direct<br>
roaming partner is known, the user terminal UE initially<br>
optionally selects<br><br>
one of the available operators. This situation will still be<br>
described in greater detail in the text which follows.<br>
After selecting an operator, the user terminal UE tunes the<br>
receiving device to the pilot channel, for example the pilot<br>
channel OP1-CPC of the selected first operator OP1. This is done<br>
by taking into consideration the reference in the information of<br>
the operator-specific subfield of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel C-CPC. In dependence on whether the user terminal UE is<br>
capable of receiving the pilot channel OP1-CPC of the selected<br>
operator, step 4, it will, in the case of adequate receivability<br>
of the pilot channel, evaluate its information, step 6, or, in<br>
the case of no or only inadequate receivability of the pilot<br>
channel, block the selected operator, step 5, and perform a<br>
reselection, step 3, of a suitable operator.<br>
After evaluating the information of the operator-specific pilot<br>
channel, the pilot channel OP1-CPC of the first operator OP1<br>
according to the example of figures 1 and 2, the user terminal<br>
UE selects a suitable system or network, step 7. As described<br>
above, this selection is carried out, for example, in<br>
dependence on the technical equipment of the user terminal or<br>
on the service to be set up. After selecting a system or<br>
network, the UMTS system according to the example of figures 1<br>
and 2, the user terminal UE tunes the receiving device to the<br>
control channel RAT1-BCH in order to receive it and evaluate<br>
its content. If the user terminal UE can adequately receive the<br>
control channel RATl-BCH and/or the system does not indicate<br>
any overload, and thus blocking of the access, step 8, it will<br>
receive it and evaluate it, step 10, in order to subsequently<br>
carry out an access to the system according to the mechanisms<br>
predetermined by the standard of the system. If, in contrast,<br>
the user terminal UE is not capable of receiving the control<br>
channel RATl-BCH of the selected system, for example because it<br>
is currently located<br><br><br>
outside a radio cell of the system, or overload of the system<br>
is<br><br>
indicated, it will block the selected system, step 9, and carry-<br>
out a reselection of a suitable system, step 7.<br>
If, after an access by the user terminal UE to the selected<br>
UMTS system, it is found that it does not support, for example,<br>
the desired service to be established, the user terminal UE<br>
again carries out a reselection of an alternative system of the<br>
operator, the WLAN system according to the example of figures 1<br>
and 2. If, however, no alternative systems of the operator are<br>
available or the user terminal UE cannot access the newly<br>
selected system, either since, as specified by way of example<br>
in figure 1, it is located outside the coverage area or cell of<br>
the WLAN system, the user terminal UE carries out a reselection<br>
of an alternative operator by again accessing the country-<br>
specific pilot channel C-CPC.<br>
A further exemplary situation occurs when the user terminal UE<br>
already has knowledge of the system last used. This can be<br>
available in the form of a storage of connection parameters of<br>
the last active connection. In this case, the user terminal UE<br>
will first attempt, after switching-on, to receive again the<br>
control or pilot channel last used. If this is not possible<br>
since the user terminal UE, for example, has changed its<br>
location since the last active connection, it will attempt to<br>
access the operator-specific pilot channel of the operator last<br>
used in order to select a new system or network. For this<br>
purpose, it can use, for example, a reference to the operator-<br>
specific pilot channel transmitted in the control channel of<br>
the system. If this is not possible, either, the user terminal<br>
UE will lastly access the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC<br>
and progressively select an operator and a system in accordance<br>
with the above description.<br><br>
system would take place in supplementary manner in step 4 or 8,<br>
respectively, according to the flowchart of figure 3.<br>
Relations between individual operators in the sense of roaming<br>
agreements are subject to continuous changes. Since, according<br>
to the prior art, a list of roaming partners of the home<br>
operator is usually stored in the SIM card of a user before the<br>
first start-up and is subsequently no longer renewed, it may no<br>
longer be valid even after a short time. If, according to the<br>
above description, a user terminal is located outside the<br>
coverage area of his home operator, it will preferably select,<br>
utilizing the country-specific pilot channel, an operator with<br>
whom the home operator has concluded a roaming agreement in<br>
order to have to pay, for example, lower charges or to be able<br>
to use special services. If, however, the user terminal selects<br>
an operator with whom there is no longer an agreement due to an<br>
outdated list of roaming partners in this situation, the user<br>
would incur, for example, disadvantageously higher charges than<br>
expected by him.<br>
In order to facilitate for the user terminal the choice of an<br>
operator with whom there is a roaming agreement and to ensure<br>
that the information is up-to-date, it is proposed, according<br>
to an embodiment of the invention, to transmit information<br>
relating to roaming agreements at the hierarchy level of the<br>
country-specific pilot channel C-CPC. In return, this<br>
information can be used by the user terminal for updating the<br>
stored list of roaming partners, independently of whether the<br>
user is located in the area of his home network or not.<br>
According to figure 2, the information can be	transmitted, for<br>
example, by supplementing the information info	in the operator-<br>
specific subfields of the C-CPC frame. As	an alternative,<br>
special frames R in the sequence of frames<br><br>
of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC can be used for<br>
transmitting information relating to roaming agreements of the<br>
operators listed in the subfields of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel C-CPC as shown in figure 4 by way of example. After a<br>
sequence of in each case m frames of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel C-CPC, for example, one frame R with information<br>
relating to roaming agreements is transmitted. The occurrence<br>
of the special frame R within the sequence of C-CPC frames can<br>
be signaled, for example, in the start fields Start of the<br>
C-CPC frames so that a user terminal, if it knows that the next<br>
special frame can only be received at a particular time<br>
interval, can switch off the receiving device for this period<br>
of time and, as a result, advantageously save energy.<br>
An exemplary structure of such a frame R with information<br>
relating to operator-specific roaming agreements is shown in<br>
figure 5a. In accordance with the frame structure of figure 2,<br>
a frame R begins with a start field Start R for indicating the<br>
beginning of the frame and for identifying this special frame<br>
in comparison with the frames of the country-specific pilot<br>
channel C-CPC. The start field Start R is followed by a field<br>
with information of the country code CC. The subfield following<br>
the subfield of the country code CC carries information info<br>
relating to, for example, the first operator OP1, wherein this<br>
information can largely correspond to the operator information<br>
in the normal C-CPC frame. The subfield of the information info<br>
relating to the first operator OP1 is followed by subfields<br>
with respective information info relating to operators ROP1,<br>
. . ., ROPn, with whom the first operator OP1 has concluded a<br>
roaming agreement. Corresponding information is transmitted to<br>
the second operator 0P2 and his operators ROP1, ..., ROPn<br>
connected by roaming agreement. After it has determined by<br>
means of the country code that it is located outside the<br>
coverage area of its home operator, a user terminal UE<br>
receiving this information will look for the code or<br>
information with respect to the home operator in the sequence<br><br>
of subfields of frame R and find one or more operators with<br>
roaming agreement, which are available within the coverage area<br><br>
of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC.<br>
As an alternative, a frame structure of the special frame R<br>
according to figure 5b can also be implemented. According to<br>
this exemplary structure, the operators ROP1, ROP2, with whom<br>
the operators OP1, ..., OPn available in the coverage area of<br>
the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC have roaming<br>
agreements, are listed and in each case allocated the available<br>
operators OP1, ..., OPn with roaming agreements in subsequent<br>
subfields.<br>
Due to the rising number of radio access technologies or<br>
adaptations to existing technologies, for example in the form<br>
of new modulation or coding types, expansion of the frequency<br>
spectrum, etc., user terminals will be increasingly equipped as<br>
terminals with a so-called software defined radio functionality<br>
(SDR) in future. This provides for individual adaptation of the<br>
devices of a terminal involved in the radio transmission to the<br>
radio access technology required in each case by a purely<br>
software-based change.<br>
From the German patent specification DE 19734933 C1, for<br>
example, a method is known in which, for the purpose of<br>
adapting a mobile station to a method of radio access,<br>
supported by a mobile radio system, to a pilot channel<br>
transmitted by a broadcast transmitting station, information<br>
about at least one radio access method of the mobile radio<br>
system is transmitted, the pilot channel is received and<br>
evaluated by the mobile station and the mobile station selects<br>
a radio access method by means of the information and generates<br>
an adaptation to this method. For this purpose, the mobile<br>
station is referred by means of the signaling, for example to a<br>
broadband transmission channel on which program modules are<br>
transmitted. These program modules are subsequently used by the<br>
mobile station for generating the adaptation.<br><br>
Figure 6 specifies, on the basis of the frame structure of the<br>
operator-specific pilot channel OP1-CPC of figure 2, a frame<br>
structure by means of which such reconfigurable terminals can<br>
be supported in accordance with the method according to the<br>
invention. A special subfield DL of the frame contains, for<br>
example, information relating to the radio access technologies<br>
in each case listed in the text which follows, so that the user<br>
terminal, before accessing this radio access technology, can<br>
adapt its devices to this technology. This information can be<br>
realized, for example, in the form of parameter information but<br>
also in the form of complete program modules. As an alternative<br>
to a subfield comprising all available access technologies, a<br>
separate field can be provided for each access technology or<br>
the information info in the subfields can be supplemented by<br>
such configuration information.<br>
Figure 7, finally, shows by way of example the individual<br>
system components which enable the method according to the<br>
invention to be realized. The geographic arrangement is based<br>
on the example of figure 1. The systems or networks are<br>
represented simplified by a respective radio access device, a<br>
base station NB (Node B) in the case of the exemplary UMTS<br>
system and a so-called access point AP in the case of the<br>
exemplary WLAN system. This base station NB or access point AP<br>
exhibits, apart from known components and devices, not shown,<br>
in each case a transmitting device SE which send out via<br>
respective antenna devices signals both of the operator-<br>
specific pilot channel OP1-CPC and of the system-specific<br>
control BCH (broadcast channel) or PCH (pilot channel),<br>
particularly omnidirectionally on the radio interface. By way<br>
of example, it is assumed that signals of the country-specific<br>
pilot channel C-CPC are emitted by a broadcast transmitting<br>
station RFS, for example, of the public broadcast system. As<br>
explained above, it is, however, similarly conceivable that the<br><br>
signals of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC, like the<br>
operator-specific pilot channels, are sent out by the base<br>
stations or access points of the operator networks.<br>
The signals both of the country-specific pilot channel C-CPC<br>
and of the operator-specific pilot channel OP1-CPC are received<br>
by a receiving device EE of the user terminal UE (user<br>
equipment) and evaluated in an evaluating device AW. These<br>
devices of the user equipment and a transmitting device SE<br>
controlled by the evaluating device AW carry out the access<br>
according to the invention to the individual pilot channels and<br>
a selection of a suitable operator or system according to the<br>
method according to the invention described above. In this<br>
context, an involvement of other known devices of the user<br>
terminal UE is just as conceivable as that of supplementary<br>
devices, for example of a special receiver for signals of the<br>
country-specific pilot channel C-CPC sent out by broadcast<br>
transmitting stations.<br><br>
