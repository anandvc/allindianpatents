				<td>Value document<br>
[001]     This invention relates to a luminescent substance, a value document, a secu-rity element and a security paper having at least one luminescent substance as an authenticity feature. The invention also relates to different methods for checking the authenticity of such value document, security element or securi-ty paper, and to methods for production thereof.<br>
[002]      Security paper will hereinafter be understood to be paper that is e.g. already equipped with security elements, such as a watermark, security thread, holo-gram patch, etc., but is not yet fit for circulation and is an intermediate prod-uct in production of the value document. Value document will refer to the product fit for circulation.<br>
[003]     The designation "value document" will refer in the context of the invention to bank notes, checks, shares, tokens, identity cards, credit cards, passports and other documents as well as labels, seals, packages or other elements for product protection.<br>
[004] The protection of value documents against forgery by means of luminescent substances has been known for some time. EP 0 052 624 B2 uses for exam-ple luminescent substances based on host lattices doped with rare earth met-als.<br>
[005]     Preferably, substances are used in which either the absorption or the emis-sion is outside the visible spectral range.<br>
[006]     If the emissions are at wavelengths between approx. 400 run and approx. 700 nm, the luminescent substances are detectable with the eye upon suitable ex-citation. For some applications this is desired, e.g. in authenticity testing by illumination with UV light. For other applications, however, it is of advan-tage if the emission is outside the visible spectral range, since special detec-tors are then necessary for detecting the substances.<br><br>
-2-<br>
[007] However, luminescent substances with characteristic properties that are suit-able for protecting value documents and in particular for automatic authen-ticity recognition are restricted in number. Most inorganic and organic lumi-nescent substances have uncharacteristic, wide spectra, insufficient emission intensity and are moreover often commercially available. This impedes their identification and makes it impracticable to use several of said substances si-multaneously.<br>
[008]     Starting out from this prior art, the invention is based on the problem of in-creasing the number of luminescent substances suitable as authenticity fea-tures for value documents and providing in particular value documents and security papers having authenticity features in the form of luminescent sub-stances that differ from value documents and security papers having hitherto known luminescent substances by a characteristically altered excitation and/or emission spectrum.<br>
[009]     The solution to this problem can be found in the independent claims. Devel-. opments are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
[0010]     According to the invention, at least one luminescent substance is used for protection. Preferably, its emission spectrum is in the visible or infrared spectral range (VIS, IR), Particularly preferably, the luminescent substance emits in the near infrared (N1R). The excitation is preferably also effected in the near infrared.<br>
[0011]     Depending on the inventive luminescent substance used, the emission band can follow the Stokes or anti-Stokes rule or quasi-resonance can be ob-served.<br>
[0012]     The substances suitable for the inventive authenticity protection are lumines-cent substances with the general formula<br>

[0023]     The Z element Fe has the oxidation state 3 here.<br>
[0024]     It is of course possible to replace individual X and/or Z elements by further elements, such as indium (In), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg) and chromi-um (Cr), as long as the stoichiometric ratios are taken into account and the . crystal lattice allows. In particular, dopings with chromium and aluminum or with magnesium and aluminum are preferred.<br>
[0025]     In a preferred embodiment, the X element present is at least La or Y or both, i.e. it holds that b?0 and/or c?0 in the general formula. All other X ele-ments or only selected ones thereof can of course also be present additional-ly. In particular, k ? 0 and/or o ? 0 holds here. <br>

[0027]     It is further preferred that X stands for La or for Y, i.e. that only one X ele-ment is present in the general formula.<br>
[0028]     In another preferred embodiment,<br>

Yb Ybp Prc NbO4 with b + e + p = 1 and 0 
[0048]     It preferably holds for all compounds in which Y and Yb are present that the' proportion of Yb is greater than the proportion of Y.<br>
[0049] The positions and forms (intensity, width, etc.) of the excitation and/or emis-sion bands are dependent on the quantity ratios of the elements involved, the type of elements and the type and quantity of the dopants.<br>
[0050]     For protection of value documents it is possible to use both broadband and narrowband luminescence, but for reasons of selectivity the narrowband lu-minescence is preferred.<br>
[0051]     One normally speaks of narrowband emission when the bands occurring in the emission spectrum show an average half-value width of less than 50 nm. However, this does not mean that bands having a half-value width outside this range do not also solve the inventive problem.<br>
[0052]     Variation and combination of the inventive luminescent substances open up numerous possibilities for influencing the excitation and emission spectra of<br><br>
-8-<br>
the inventive luminescent substances and thus producing a multiplicity of se-curity features. Besides the evaluation of the excitation and/or emission spec-tra, the lifetime of luminescence or decay time can likewise be used for dis-tinction. Evaluation can take account of not only the wavelengths of the exci-tation or emission lines but also their number and/or form and/or intensities, so that any desired coding can be represented.<br>
[0053]     Likewise it is possible to obtain an energy transfer between like and/or un-like elements in certain inventive luminescent substances, i.e. produce a quasi-resonance, and to use it for identification.<br>
[0054]     If the value document is marked, not with one, but with several, of the inven-tive luminescent substances, the number of distinguishable combinations can be increased further. If different mixing ratios are moreover distinguished from each other, the number of combinations can be increased again. Mark-ing can be done either at different places on the value document or at the same place. If the luminescent substance is applied or incorporated at differ-ent places on the value document, it is possible to produce a spatial code, in the simplest case e.g. a bar code.<br>
[0055]     Further, the falsification security of the value document can be increased if the special selected luminescent substance e.g. in a value document is linked with other information of the value document, permitting a check by means of a suitable algorithm. The value document can of course have further addi-tional authenticity features, such as classic fluorescence and/or magnetism, besides the inventive luminescent substance.<br>
[0056]     The luminescent substances can be incorporated into the value document in a great variety of ways according to the invention. For example, the lumines- cent substances can be incorporated into a printing ink. It is also possible to admix the luminescent substance to the paper pulp or plastic mass during production of a value document based on paper or plastic. The luminescent substances can likewise be provided on or in a plastic supporting material, which for example can in turn be at least partly embedded in the paper pulp.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The supporting material, which is based on a suitable polymer, such as PMMA, and in which the inventive luminescent substance is embedded, can have the form of a security thread, a mottling fiber or a planchet. Likewise, for product protection the luminescent substance can be e.g. incorporated di-rectly into the material of the object to be protected, e.g. in housings and plastic bottles.<br>
[0057]     However, the plastic or paper supporting material can also be fastened to any other desired object e.g. for product protection. In this case the supporting material preferably has the form of a label. If the supporting material is part of the product to be protected, as is the case e.g. with tear threads, any other design is of course also possible. In certain application cases it can be expe-dient to provide the luminescent substance as an invisible coating on the val-ue document. It can be present here all over or also in the form of certain pat-terns, such as stripes, lines, circles, or also in the form of alphanumeric char-acters. To ensure the invisibility of the luminescent substance, it is possible according to the invention to use either a colorless luminescent substance in the printing ink or coating lacquer, or a colored luminescent substance in such a low concentration that the transparency of the coating is just given. Alternatively or in addition, the supporting material can also already be suit-ably colored, so that colored luminescent substances are not perceived due to their inherent color.<br>
[0058]     The inventive luminescent substances are normally processed in the form of pigments. For better processing or to increase their stability, the pigments can in particular be present as individually encapsulated pigment particles or be covered with an inorganic or organic coating. For example, the individual pigment particles are surrounded by a silicate cover and can  thus be more easily dispersed in media. Likewise, different pigment particles of a combi-nation can be encapsulated jointly, e.g. in fibers, threads, silicate covers. It is thus e.g. no longer possible to change the "code" of the combination subse-quently. "Encapsulation" refers here to complete encasing of the pigment<br><br>
-10-<br>
particles, while "coating" also refers to partial encasing or coating of the pig-ment particles.<br>
[0059]     The inventive luminescent substances are characterized in particular by their high intensity in the emission spectrum and the simple production. Further-more, the inventive luminescent substances have the advantage that the loca-tion of the emission bands is already influenced by simple variation in the el-ementary composition, thereby providing a multiplicity of distinguishable feature substances.<br>
[0060]     In the following, some examples of the inventive luminescent substance will be explained in more detail.<br>
[0061] For preparation, the initial substances in oxidic form or substances that can be converted to oxides are mixed in a suitable ratio, then annealed, crushed, washed (e.g. with water), dried and ground.<br>
Example 1: Y0.1 Yb0..9TaO4<br>
[0062]      539.46 g of Ta2O5, 27.57 g of Y2O3, 432.97 g of Yb2O3 and 500.00 g of Na2-SO4 (ultrapure, anhydrous) as a fluxing agent are intimately intermixed in a paddle mixer. The mix is poured into a crucible and annealed at 1150°C for 6 to 24 hours. The material cooled for 1 to 2 days after the oven is switched off is liberated from the sulfate by washing, and ground with a common pin mill to fineness that permits homogeneous and invisible incorporation into paper or printing inks.<br>
[0063]     The thus produced compound has the totals formula Y0.1Yb0.9TaO4.<br>

[0076]     Further embodiments and advantages of the invention will be explained in the following with reference to the figure. The proportions shown in the fig-ure do not necessarily correspond to the relations existing in reality and serve mainly to improve clarity.<br>
[0077]     Fig. 1 shows an inventive value document in cross section.<br>
[0078]     Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the inventive security element. The security element consists in this case of a label 2 composed of a paper or plastic layer 3, a transparent cover layer 4 and an adhesive layer 5. Said label 2 is con-nected via the adhesive layer 5 to any desired substrate 1. Said substrate 1 can be a value document, identity card, passport, certificate or the like, but also another object to be protected, such as a CD, package or the like. The luminescent substance 6 is contained within the volume of the layer 3 in this embodiment.<br>
[0079]     Alternatively, the luminescent substance could also be contained in a print-ing ink (not shown) which is printed on one of the label layers, preferably on the surface of the layer 3.<br>
[0080]     Instead of providing the luminescent substance in or on a supporting material which is then fastened to an object as a security element, it is also possible according to the invention to provide the luminescent substance directly in the value document to be protected or on the surface thereof in the form of a coating.<br><br>
