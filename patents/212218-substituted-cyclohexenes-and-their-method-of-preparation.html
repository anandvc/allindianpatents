Substituted cyclohexenes<br>
The present invention relates to substituted cyclohexenes, to their use as well as to their method of preparation.<br>
The main disadvantage of organoleptic compounds of natural origin, such as grapefruit oil, is, apart from price and availability, their changing quality and odor as well as flavor characteristics. The compounds of grapefruit oil, which are responsible for the typical odor and flavor are well known: Nootkatone was object of many syntheses and structurally related bicyclic compounds were described in various patents. Nonetheless, nootkatone is still too expensive for many applications and its analogues often lack various facets of the natural product. Sulfur containing compounds like l-p-menthene-8-thiol have also been used in grapefruit accords. Other compounds in this domain are 4-methoxy-2-methylbutan-2-thiol and 8-mercapto-p-menthone. However, these compounds are chemically and olfactorely non homogenous mixtures and, in addition, are sensitive towards oxidation. A further compound exhibiting a fruity, cassis like odor is described in EP 0 167 709,<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having long lasting and natural grapefruit notes accompanied by floral and fresh green aspects.<br>
Further it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds with above organoleptic characteristics which do not contain sulfur.<br><br>
Further it is an object	of the present  invention tc<br>
provide  an  inexpensive	method  for  preparing  such<br>
compounds.<br>
It has  surprisingly been found that  compounds of the general formula (I)<br><br>
have powerful long lasting	natural fruity grapefruit notes<br>
with minty and fresh green	tonalities. In compounds of the<br>
formula I having less than	18 carbon atoms, A stands for a<br>
residue of the formula II,	III or IV<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R1-R6 are independently hydrogen or a methyl group, R is a methyl or ethyl group, and R5 and R7 may form together a phenyl ring or a furan;<br>
X is either a carbonyl group or CR OR , wherein R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, ethinyl or vinyl and R9 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;<br>
R10 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;<br>
the dotted line in formula (II) is a bond only if X is CR8OR9 and<br>
the dotted line in formula (III) and the dotted line in formula (IV) optionally is a bond.<br>
The above formula include all possible stereo- and double bond isomers.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein A is a residue of formula IIa <br>
wherein R1 -R3 are independently hydrogen or a methyl group are preferred.<br>
Further preferred are compounds of formula I wherein A is a residue of formula IIb<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R -R are independently hydrogen or a methyl group;<br>
R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, ethinyl or vinyl and R9 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;<br>
and the dotted line in formula (lib) optionally is a bond.<br>
Especially preferred compounds are:<br>
1,2,6-trimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohex-2-enol,<br>
2,6-dimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohex-2-enol,<br>
2,6-dimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-1-vinyl-eyelohex-2-enol,<br>
2,6-dimethyl-1-ethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohex-2-enol,<br>
2,6-dimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohex-2-enone,<br>

6-methoxy-l,5,6-trimethyl-5-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohexene,<br>
2,2,6-trimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohex-3-enone.<br><br>
In an organoleptic composition compounds according to the present invention may be used alone or in combination with numerous fragrance or flavor ingredients of natural and/or synthetic origin. The range of the natural fragrances or flavors includes in addition to readily volatile, also moderately and only slightly volatile components. The synthetic fragrances or flavors embrace representatives from practically all classes of fragrance or flavor substances. The following list comprises examples of known fragrances or flavors which may be combined with the compounds of the invention:<br>
natural products: tree moss absolute, basil oil, tropical fruit oils (such as bergamot oil, mandarin oil, etc.), mastix absolute, myrtle oil, palmarosa oil, patchouli oil, petitgrain oil, wormwood oil, lavender oil, rose oil, jasmin oil, ylang-ylang oil, etc.;<br>
alcohols: farnesol, geraniol, linalool, nerol, phenylethyl alcohol,  rhodinol,  cinnamic alcohol,  (2)-hex-3-en-l-ol,<br>
menthol, a-terpineol, etc.;<br>
aldehydes: citral, a-hexyl cinnamaldehyde, Lilial, methylionone, verbenone, nootkatone, geranylacetone, etc.;<br>
esters: allyl phenoxyacetate, benzyl salicylate, cinnamyl propionate, citronellyl acetate, decyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl butyrate, ethyl acetoacetate, cis- 3-hexenyl isobutyrate, cis-3-hexenyl salicylate, linalyl acetate, methyl dihydrojasmonate, styralyl propionate, vetiveryl acetate, benzyl acetate, geranyl acetate, etc.;<br>
lactones: y-undecalactone, 5-decalactone, pentadecanolide, 12-oxahexadecanolide, etc.;<br><br>
acetals: Viridine (phenylacetaldehyde dimethylacetal), etc. ;<br>
other components often used in perfumery: indole, p-mentha- 8 -thiol-3-one, methyleugenol, eugenol, anethol, etc. .<br>
The compounds of the present invention harmonize particularly well with floral notes (lily of the valley, rose, iris, jasmine, ylang-ylang, narcissus notes, etc,) as well as with woody, chypre and animalic notes, tobacco-and an patchouli-like compositions, etc.<br>
The percentage in which the compounds of the invention are used in a composition may vary within wide limits ranging from a few parts per thousand in mass market products (e.g. cleaning compositions, deodorant, etc.) up to a few percents in alcoholic extracts for fine perfumery. In all cases, the compounds of formula I provide fragrance compositions with powerful long lasting natural fruity grapefruit notes and minty and fresh green tonalities. Flavoured products comprise compounds according to the present invention at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 ppm.<br>
Compositions comprising one or more compounds according to the present invention are preferably used in consumer products and industrial products. A few examples are body care and cosmetic products such as cream, shampoo, soap, sun cream, household products such as detergent, household cleaner, fabric softener, etc..<br>
In a preferred embodiment food and beverage products comprise one or more compounds according to the present invention.<br><br>
Compounds according to the present invention can be prepared as depicted in scheme 1 and 2.<br>
Scheme 1:<br><br>
C-Alkylations of 2, 6-disubstituted phenols by reaction of a phenol with a metal hydride and an alkenylchloride are known in the art (Greuter, H. et al. (1977) Helv. Chim. Acta, 60, 1701) . The resulting dienones are known to be unstable and to rearrange to higher alkylated phenols, or to aryl-alkenyl-ethers, or the allyl unit may also be cleaved off under certain reaction conditions known to those skilled in the art (Chalais, S. et al. (1986) Tetrahedron Lett., 27,2627) .<br>
The alkylation for preparing the compounds of the present invention can also be performed under phase-transfer conditions, which avoids the use of the expensive metal hydride. It was surprisingly found, that the intermediate dienones of the formula VI of scheme 1 can be selectively hydrogenated with a transition metal catalyst, instead of generating the above mentioned side products. A preferred transition metal catalyst is palladium on charcoal. This hydrogenation is especially efficient for substrates of<br><br>
scheme 1 wherein the 3' -position (R6 and R7) is dialkylated, or for substrates of scheme 1 wherein R and R constitute an aromatic ring.<br>
The α, β-unsaturated ketones of the formula Ic may be converted to cyclohexenol derivatives of the formula lb. Depending on number and location of substituents on the cyclohexene ring, 2 or more diastereomeric alcohols may be formed. For example, 1,2,6-trimethyl-6-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-cyclohexenol consists of 2 isomers, one having a borneol/grapefruit character with a GC threshold of 18 ng/L, the other having a grapefruit/cassis note with an odor threshold of 0.5 ng/L.<br>
The unsaturated ketones of the formula VI may be converted to cyclohexadienol derivatives of the formula la according to the process illustrated in scheme 1.<br>
In addition, compounds of the formula Ic and of the formula lb (scheme 1) may further be converted as described in scheme 2.<br><br>
The invention will be further described, by way of illustration, in the following examples.<br><br>
All compounds were unambiguously identified by their "1H-NMR- (chemical shifts (S) are given in ppm downfield from TMS; coupling constants J  in Hz), IR- and MS-spectra.<br><br>
