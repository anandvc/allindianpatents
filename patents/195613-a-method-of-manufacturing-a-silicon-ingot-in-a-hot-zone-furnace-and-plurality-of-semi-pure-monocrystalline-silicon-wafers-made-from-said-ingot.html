Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a silicon ingot in a hot zone furnace, and generally to microelectronic manufacturing methods and devices, and more particularly to silicon ingot manufacturing methods and silicon ingots and wafers manufactured thereby<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Integrated circuits are widely used in consumer and commercial applications Integrated circuits are generally fabricated from monocrystailine silicon As the integration density of integrated circuits continues to increase, it generally is of increasing importance to provide high-quality monocrystalHne semiconductor material for integrated circuits Integrated circuits are typically produced by fabricating a large ingot of monocrystalline silicon, slicing the ingot into wafers, performing, numerous microelectronic fabrication processgs on the wafers and then dicing the wafers into individual integrated circuits that are<br><br>
packaged Because the purity and crystallinity of the silicon ingot can have a large impact on the performance of the ultimate integrated circuit devices that are fabricated therefrom, increased efforts have been made to fabricate ingots and wafers with reduced numbers of defects<br><br>
-2-<br>
Conventional methods of manufacturing monocrystalline silicon ingots will now be described   An overview of these methods is provided in Chapter ! of the textbook "Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Volume 1, Process Technology", by Wolf and Tauber, 1986, pp. 1-35, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference   In manufacturing monocrystalline silicon, electronic grade polysilicon is converted into a monocrystalline silicon ingot.  Polycrystalline silicon such as quartzite is refined to produce electronic grade polycrystalline silicon. The refined electronic grade pplycrystalline silicon is then grown into a single crystal ingot using the Czochralski (CZ)-or Float Zone (FZ) technique   Since the present invention relates to manufacturing a silicon ingot using the CZ technique, this technique will now be described<br>
CZ growth involves crystalline solidification of atoms from a liquid_phase at an interface   In particular, a crucible is loaded with a charge of electronic grade polycrystalhne silicon and the charge is melted   A seed crystal of silicon of precise orientation tolerances is lowered into the molten silicon   The seed crystal is then withdrawn at a controlled rate in the axial direction   Both the seed crystal and the crucible are generally rotated during the pulling process, in opposite directions.<br>
     The initial pull rate is generally relatively rapid so that a thin neck of silicon is produced   Then, the_melt temperature is reduced and stabilized so that the desired ingot diameter can be formed   This diameter is generally maintained by controlling the pull rate   The pulling continues until the charge is nearly exhausted, and which time a tail is formed<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a CZ puller. As shown in Figure 1, the CZ puller 100 includes a furnace, a crystal pulling mechanism, an environment controller and a computer-based control system   The CZ furnace is generally referred to as a hot zone furnace   The hot zone furnace includes heating elements 102 and 104, an inner crucible 106 which may be made of quartz, an outer crucible 108 which may be made of graphite and a rotation shaft 110 that rotates in a first direction 112 as shown   A hot shield 114 may provide additional thermal distribution<br>
The crystal pulling mechanism includes a crystal pulling shaft 120 which may rotate in direction 122 opposite direction 112 as shown   Crystal pulling shaft 120 holds seed crystal 124, which is pulled from molten polysilicon charge 126 in crucible 106 to form ingot 128<br><br>
-3-<br>
The ambient control system may include the chamber enclosure 130, a cooling port 132 and other flow controllers and vacuum exhaust systems that are not shown A computer-based control system may be used to control the heating elements, puller and other electrical and mechanical elements<br>
In order to grow a monocrystalline silicon ingot, the seed crystal 124 is contacted to the molten silicon charge 126 and is gradually pulled in the axial direction (up). Cooling and solidification of the molten silicon charge 126 into monocrystalline silicon occurs at the interface 130 between the ingot 128 and the molten silicon 126<br>
Real silicon ingots differ from ideal monocrystalline ingots because they include imperfections or defects   These defects are undesirable in fabricating integrated circuit devices   These defects may be generally classified as point defects or agglomerates (three-dimensional defects)   Point defects are of two general types: vacancy point defects and interstitial point defects   In a vacancy point defect, a silicon atom is missing from one of its normal positions in the silicon crystal lattice This vacancy gives rise to a vacancy point defect   On the other hand, if an atom is found at a non-lattice site (interstitial site) in the silicon crystal, it gives rise to an interstitial point defect<br>
 Point defects are generally formed at the interface 130 between the molten silicon 126 and the solid silicon 128   However, as the ingot 128 continues to be pulled, the portion that was at the interface begins to cool   During cooling, diffusion of vacancy point defects and interstitial point defects may cause defects to coalesce and form vacancy agglomerates or interstitial agglomerates   Agglomerates are three-dimensional (large) structures that arise due to coalescence of point defects Interstitial agglomerates are also referred to as dislocation defects or D-defects Agglomerates are also sometimes named by the technique that is used to detect these defects   Thus, vacancy agglomerates are sometimes referred to as Crystal-Originated Particles (COP), Laser Scattering Tomography (LST) defects or Flow Pattern Defects (FPD)   Interstitial agglomerates are also known as Large Dislocation (L/D) agglomerates   A discussion of defects in monocrystalline silicon is provided in Chapter 2 of the above-mentioned textbook by Wolf and Tauber, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference<br>
ft is known that many parameters may need to be controlled in order to grow a high punty ingot having low numbers of defects   For example, it is known to control<br><br>

the pull rate of the seed crystal and the temperature gradients in the hot zone structure Voronkov's Theory found that the ratio of V to G (referred to as V/G) can determine the point defect concentration in the ingot, where V is the pull rate of the ingot and G is the temperature gradient of the ingot-melt interface   Voronkov's Theory is described in detail in "The Mechanism of Swirl Defects Formation in Silicon" by Voronkov, Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol 59, 1982, pp 625-643<br>
An application of Voronkov's Theory may be found in a publication by the present inventor et al entitled "Effect of Crystal Defects on Device Characteristics", Proceedings pf the Second International Symposium on Advanced Science and Technology of Silicon Material, November 25-29, 1996, p 519   At Figure 15, reproduced herein as Figure 2, a graphical illustration of vacancy and interstitial concentrations, as a function of V/G is shown   Voronkov's Theory shows that the generation of vacancy/interstitial mixture in a wafer is determined by V/G   More particularly, for V/G ratios below a critical ratio, an interstitial rich ingot is formed, while lor V/G ratios above the critical ratio, a vacancy rich ingot is formed<br>
Notwithstanding many theoretical investigations by physicists, material scientists and others, and many practical investigations by CZ pulier manufacturers, there continues to be a need to reduce the defect density in monocrystalline silicon wafers   The ultimate need is for-pure silicon wafers that are free of vacancy and interstitial agglomerates<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The piesent invention provides methods of manufacturing a silicon ingot in a hot zone furnace by pulling the ingot from a silicon melt in the hot zone furnace in an axial direction, at a pull rate profile of the ingot from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace that is sufficiently high so as to prevent interstitial agglomerates bu is_ sufficiently low so as to confine vacancy agglomerates to a vacancy rich region at the axis of the ingot --The ingot so pulled is sliced into a plurality of semi-pure wafers each having a vacancy rich region at the center thereof that includes vacancy agglomerates and a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates<br>
 The present invention stems fiom the realization that agglomerates will form from point defects only if the point defect concentration exceeds a certain critical concentration   If the point defect concentiation (vacancy or interstitial) can be<br><br>
- 5 -	<br>
maintained below this critical concentration, agglomerates will not form as the ingot is being pulled   In orlder to mamtain point defrct concentrations below_cntical point defect concentrations, the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the ingot-melt interlace (V/G) is confined (1) above a first cntical ratio  of pull rate to temperature gradient at the ingot-melt interface that must be maintained in order to_prevent interstitial agglomerates and (2) below a second critical ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the ingot-melt interface that cannot be exceeded in order to confine vacancy_agglomerates to a vacancy rich region-at-the center of the ingot   The pull rate profile is therefore adjusted to maintain the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient above the first critical ratio and below the second critical ratio as the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace at a pull rate profile of the ingot from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace that is sufficiently high so as to prevent interstitial agglomerates, but is also sufficiently low as to prevent vacancy agglomerates Accordingly, when this ingot is sliced into wafers, the wafers are pure silicon wafers that may include point defects but that are free of.vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, it has been determined that if the V/G ratio is confined to within a narrower range, both the point interstitial concentration and the point vacancy concentration can be maintained below the critical point defect concentrations that will form agglomerates   Thus, the entire ingot can be agglomerate free-<br>
   To form pure silicon, a first critical ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the ingot melt interface is determined, that must be maintained to prevent interstitial agglomerates   A second critical ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the mgot-melt interface that cannot be exceeded in order to prevent vacancy agglomerates is determined   A pull rate profile is then determined that maintains the ratio of pull rate to ternperatuie gradient above the first critical ratio and below the second critical ratio as the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone surface<br>
In order to maintain the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the mgot-mclt interface between the two critical ratios, radial temperature gradients and axial tempeiature gradients are considered   In the radial direction, the temperature gradient across a wafer will generally vary because of the different thermal environments that<br><br>
-6-<br>
are experienced by the central portion of the wafer compared to the edge portion More specifically, the teinpexaturc-gradient generally is higher at the wafer-edge compared to the_wafer center, due to thermal charactenstics. The pull rate is always constant across the wafer   Therefore, the rati of V/G generally decreases from the center of the wafer Jo edge of the wa/er in the radial direction   The pull rate and hot zone furnace are designed to maintain the V/G ratio, from the center of the wafer to within a diffusion length of the edge of the wafer, below the critical point defect concentrations that would cause agglomerates, i e between the first and second critical ratios   Similar considerations apply in the axial direction   In the axial direction, the temperature gradient generally decreases as more of the ingot is pulled, due to the increased thermal mass of the ingot   Accordingly, as the ingot is pulled, the pull rate generally must be decreased in order to maintain the ratio of V/G between the first and second critical ratios<br>
Thus,by,controlling-the pull-rate profile to,maintain V/G between two critical ratios, semi-pure wafers with a vacancy rich region at the center thereof and a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge may be formed   The vacancy rich region may include both vacancy point as well as agglomerate defects, and the pure region includes neither vacancy nor interstitial agglomerates Alternatively and preferably, pure wafers may be formed that may include point defects but that are free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates<br>
        The first and second critical ratios may be determined empirically or by using 'simulations. The ratios may be determined empirically by slicing a reference ingot into wafers or by slicing the reference ingot axially. Combinations of empirical and simulation techniques may be used.<br>
In particular, the first critical ratio and the second critical ratio may be empirically determined by pulling a reference ingot from a silicon melt in the hot zone furnace at a pull rate that varies over a range of pull rates   The reference ingot is then sliced into wafers   For semi-pure silicon wafers, a wafer having a predetermined size vacancy rich region and that is also free of interstitial agglomerates is identified Preferably, a wafer having a smallest vacancy rich region and that is also free of interstitial agglomerates is identified   The first and second critical ratios for semi-pure silicon are calculated from the pull rate of the identified wafer and the position of the identified wafer in the ingot<br><br>
-7-<br>
In order to determine the first and second cntical ratios for pure silicon wafers, the reference ingot is puiled,sliced into wafers, and a wafer that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates is identified   The first and second critical ratios for pure silicon are determined from the pull rate of the identified wafer and the position of the identified wafer in the ingot<br>
The reference ingot is preferably pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace at a pull rate that varies over a range of pull rates from a first pull rate, to a second pull rate that is lower than the first pull rate, to a third pull rate that is higher than the second pull rate and that may be lower or higher than the first pull rate   The first, second and third pull rates are preferably based upon the desired diameter of ingots and expected V/G ratios   Linear changes in pull rates are preferably used so that the first and second critical ratios can be determined.<br>
In another empirical technique, a reference ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace at a pull rate that varies over a range of pull rates   The reference ingot is then axially sliced. For semi-pure wafers, at least one axial position in the axially sliced reference ingot is identified, having a smallest vacancy rich region and that is free of interstitial agglomerates   The first and second critical ratios for semi-pure silicon are then calculated from the pull rate corresponding to the identified axial position in the axially sliced ingot<br>
In order to form perfect silicon, at least one axial position in an axially sliced reference ingot is identified having no interstitial or vacancy agglomerates   The first and second critical ratios for pure silicon are then calculated from the pull rate of the identified at least one axial position and the location of the identified axial position in the axially sliced ingot<br>
The first and second critical ratios may also be determined theoretically using simulations   In particular, the first and second critical ratios may be identified from Voronkov's Theory   A pull rate to radial temperature gradient profile may be determined by simulating operation of a specific hot zone furnace during ingot pulling   A pull rate to axial temperature profile may be determined by simulating operation of the hot zone furnace during ingot pulling   A pull rate profile that maintains the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient in the ingot above the first critical ratio and below the second critical ratio may then be determined from the simulated pull rate to radial temperature profile and the simulated pull rate to axial temperature profile<br><br>
-8-<br>
It will also be understood that the first and second critical ratios for pure silicon may be identified in a two step process. First, the first and second critical ratios for semi-pure silicon may be determined empirically and/or theoretically. Then, the hot zone structure may be modified until the first and second critical ratios can be determined empirically and/or theoretically<br>
The present invention can provide a plurality of similar semi-pure monocrystalline_Silicon wafers that are manufactured from one silicon ingot Each of the semi-pure silicon wafers has a vacancy rich region at the center thereof that includes vacancy agglomerates and a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates. The vacancy rich region of each of the wafers has substantially the same diameter Preferably, the pure region is at least 36% of the wafer area More preferably, the pure region is at least 60% of the wafer area<br>
If the ratio of V/G is controlled even more tightly, the present invention can produce a plurality of pure monocrystalline silicon wafers that are manufactured from one silicon ingot, wherein each of the pure silicon wafers is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates Accordingly, by maintaining the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient at the ingot-melt interface between upper and lower bounds, agglomerate defects can be confined to a vacancy rich region at the center of the wafer or can be eliminated to produce pure silicon wafers<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a silicon ingot in a hot zone furnace, wherein an ingot is pulled from a silicon melt in the hot zone furnace in an axial direction at a predetermined pull rate profile to produce semi-perfect wafers having a first region at the center thereof that<br><br>
-8A-<br>
includes vacancy agglomerates, and a second region between the first region and the wafer edge that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates, wherein the pull rate and the temperature gradient at the ingot-melt interface are determined by . determining a first critical ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient that may not be under-run in order to prevent interstitial agglomerates, by maintaining the interstitial point defect concentration below a critical interstitial concentration at which interstitial point defects coalesce, to interstitial agglomerates , determining a second critical ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient that may not be exceeded in order to confine the vacancy agglomerates to the first region, by maintaining the vacancy point defect concentration below a critical vacancy concentration at which vacancy point defects coalesce to vacancy agglomerates ; and controlling the pull rate profile by maintaining the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient above the first critical ratio and below the second critical ratio<br>

Detailed Dcscription of Preferred Embodiments<br>
 The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown   This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein, rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art Like numbers refer to like elements throughout<br>
Overview   Vacancy Rich and Perfect Wafers<br>
Referring now to Figures 3A-3E, an overview of the fabrication of semi-pure wafers having (1) a vacancy rich region at the center thereof that may include vacancy agglomerates and (2) a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates, will now be described   As shown in Figure 3 A, the fabrication of these vacancy rich wafers can begin with an overview of Voronkov's Theory   Voronkov's Theory is graphically illustrated in Figure 3A   As shown by the hne beginning from the edge (E) and<br><br>
- 10-<br>
ending at the center (C), it has been found according to the present invention that if the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradicnt at the ingot melt surface, referred to as V/G, is maintained greater than (V/G)1 at a diffusion length from the edge E, identified by point a, and less than (V/G)2 at the center C, then semi-pure wafers having a vacancy rich region at the center thereof and a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge may be fabricated. In particular, V/G will vary radially across a wafer in an ingot, and generally will decrease from the wafer center tO the wafer edge due to the differing thermal characteristics at the center and edge of the wafer  Thus, a given wafer experiences a radial V/G range as shown in Figure 3A from the center (C) to the edge (E) thereof<br>
A critical concern in the fabrication of silicon ingots and wafers is the formation of agglomerates, either vacancy or interstitial, in the wafer   It is known that agglomerates are formed due to coalescence of point defects that are formed during the initial fabrication of the ingot from the melt   The point defect concentration is generally determined by conditions at the interface between the silicon ingot and the silicon melt   '1 hen, as the ingot is pulled further, diffusion and cooling determines the coalescence of point defects to form agglomerates<br>
As shown in Figure 3B, it has been found, according to the invention, that a critical vacancy point delect concentration [V] and a critical interstitial point defect concentration [I]* exist, below which point defects will not coalesce into agglomerates   It has been found according to the present invention that if the concentration of point defects is maintained below these critical concentrations in the peripheral area of the wafer, then a vacancy rich region is formed at the center of the wafer, but a pure region is formed between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge<br>
Thus, as shown in Figure 3B, the vacancy concentration is maintained below the critical vacancy concentration [V]* across the wafer except near the center C thereof  Thus, as shown in Figure 3C, a vacancy rich region [V] is formed at the center thereof,1 but the area outside the vacancy rich region [V] to the wafer edge, is free of vacancy agglomerates and is therefore designated [P] (pure or perfect)<br>
Referring again to Figure 3B, for interstitials, the interstitial concentration is maintained below the critical interstitial concentration [I|* from the center C of the wafer until a diffusion length L1 from the edge E of the wafer corresponding to point a   Between the diffusion length L1 of the wafer and the edge E, even if the interstitial<br><br>
-11 -<br>
concentration is initially above the critical concentration [I|* at the ingot-melt interface, diffusion will allow the interstitial vacancies to diffuse out of the ingot and not form agglomerates during the crystal growth   The diffusion length L1 is generally between about 2 5 and 3 cm for 8 inch wafers   Accordingly, as shown in Figure 3C, a semi-pure wafer having a vacancy rich region [V] at the center thereof and a perfect region [P] between the vacancy rich region and the edge, is formed   Preferably, the pure region [P] is at least 36% of the wafer area and more preferably is at least 60% of the wafer area<br>
In order to form wafers of Figure 3C,V/G must be maintained greater than (V/G)1_at point_a__and less than or equal to (V/G)2 at the center C   In order to maintain the ratio of V/G between these two critical values, two thermal considerations are taken in to account   First, the radial temperature gradient G experienced from the center C of the wafer to the diffusion length a of the wafer must be maintained within these values   Thus, V/G at the center should be close to (V/G)2 in order to confine vacancy agglomerates to the vacancy rich region   Moreover, V/G at the diffusion length L1 from the edge must be maintained greater than (V/G)1 in order to prevent interstitial agglomerates   Accordingly, the hot zone of the furnace should preferably be designed to maintain a variation in G from the center of the wafer to the diffusion length of the wafer, such that V/G is maintained between (V/G)2 and (V/G)1<br>
A second consideration is that G will vary axially as the wafer is pulled from the melt beginning at the seed and ending at the tail In particular, the increasing thermal mass of the ingot, the decreasing thermal mass of the melt and other thermal considerations will generally cause G to decrease as the ingot is pulled from the melt Thus, in order to maintain V/G within the first and second critical ratios, the pull rate profile is adjusted as the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace<br>
By controlling V/G as the ingot is pulled, vacancy agglomerates can be confined to a vacancy rich region [V] near the axis A of the ingot shown in Figure 3D Interstitial agglomerates are not formed, so that the area of the ingot outside the vacancy rich region [V] is labeled [P] for pure or perfect   As also shown in Figure 3D, this yields a plurality of semi-pure wafers having vacancy rich regions [V] at the center thereof that include vacancy agglomerates, and pure regions between the vacancy rich region and a wafer edge that is fiee of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates   T he diameter of the vacancy rich region [V] is the same in each wafer   The identification of the plurality of wafers that are formed from a single<br><br>
- 12-<br>
ingot may be found by the ID number, labeled ID in Figure 3D, which is generally an<br>
alphanumeric code that is marked on every wafer. This eighteen character field can<br>
identify the wafers as all coming from a single ingot<br>
Figure 3E illustrates a pull rate profile that is used to maintain V/G between<br>
the two critical ratios, as the ingot is pulled from the melt   Since G generally decreases as the ingot is pulled from the melt, the pull rate V is also generally decreased to maintain V/G between the two critical ratios   In order to allow for expected process variations, V/G is preferably maintained midway between the first and second critical ratios   Thus, a guard band is preferably maintained to allow for process variations<br>
Overview   Pure Silicon Wafers<br>
Figures 4A-4E correspond to Figure 3A-3E and illustrate the control of a pull rate proille to form pure silicon ingots and wafers   As shown in Figure 4A, if V/G is maintained within a tighter tolerance between the wafer center C and a diffusion length a from the wafer edge E, the formation of vacancy agglomerates as well as interstitial agglomerates may be prevented throughout the wafer   Thus, as shown in Figure 4B, in the center of the wafer (the axis A of the ingot), the ratio of V/G is maintained lower than the critical ratio (V/G)2 which would form vacancy agglomerates   Similarly, V/G is maintained above the critical ratio (V/G)1 that would form interstitial agglomerates   Accordingly, pure silicon [P] of Figure 4C is formed that is free of interstitial agglomerates and vacancy agglomerates   The pure ingot is shown in Figure 4D, along with a set of pure wafers   A pull rate profile for pure silicon is shown in Figure 4E<br>
Determination of Pull Rate Profiles<br>
According to the present invention, in order to form semi-pure wafers having a vacancy rich region at the center thereof, and a pure region between the vacancy rich region and the wafer edge, a pull rate profile (Figure 3E)_is determined that maintains the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient in the ingot above a first cntical ratio and below a second critical ratio as the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace   Similarly, in order to form pure silicon that may include point defects but that is free of vacancy agglomerates and interstitial agglomerates, a pull rate profile (Figure 4E) is determined that maintains the ratio of pull rate to temperature gradient<br><br>
-13 -<br>
above a first critical ratio and below a second critical ratio, as the ingot is pulled from the silicon melt in the hot zone furnace   The determination of the pull rate profiles will now be described<br>
The pull rate profile may be determined theoretically by simulation, empirically by axial slicing of reference ingots, empirically by slicing a reference ingot into wafers or by a combination of these techniques   Moreover, the pull rate profile for pure silicon may be determined by first determining a pull rate profile for semi-pure silicon and then modifying the hot zone structure to obtain a pull rate profile for pure silicon   These techniques will now be described.<br>
Pull Rate Profile by Simulation<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the theoretical determination of a pull rate profile by simulation will now be described   As shown in Figure 5, commercial stmulation software may be used to simulate the radial change in V/G (referred to as A(V/G)) at Block 502   Then, at Block 504, a determination is made as to whether the change in V/G from the center to the diffusion length L1 from the edge is sufficiently small to satisfy the criteria to form semi-pure wafers or pure wafers   In particular, for silicon having a vacancy rich region as illustrated in Figure 3C, the ?(V/G) must be between (V/G)1 and (V/G)2 for all regions between radius d and radius a of the wafers   Stated alternatively, interstitial point defect concentration must be less than [1]* for radii of the wafer between the center C and a, and vacancy point concentration must be less than [V]* for radii of the wafer greater than d   Similarly, to form pure silicon as shown in Figure 4, the ? (V/G) must be less than or equal to (V/G)2- (V/G)1 to maintain [V] below the critical concentration [V]*, and to also maintain [I] below the critical concentration [I]* for all radii from the center C to the diffusion distance a<br>
Continuing with the description of Figure 5, at Block 504 if the radial change in V/G that is determined at Block 502 is too large to satis by the conditions for semi-pure or pure wafers (Figures 3D and 4D), then the hot zone may be modified at Block 506 and again simulated, until the gradient is sufficiently small to satisfy the desired conditions   In particular, as shown in Figure 9, the hot zone may be modified by adding a cover 914 to hot shield 114 and filling the space between the cover 914 and the hot zone shield 114 with a heat conservation material, such as carbon ferrite<br><br>
- 14-<br>
Other hot zone modifications may be made to reduce the temperature gradient as necessary<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, a stmulation of the axial change in V/G is performed at Block 508 to determine the change in A(V/G) as the ingot is pulled Again, a test is made at Block 510 as to whether the change is sufficiently small to maintain the desired characteristics as the wafer is grown   If not the hot zone is modified at Block 506   Then, at Block 512, the pull rate profile is determined in order to maintain the critical V/G, as shown in Figures 3E or 4E   Ingots are then fabricated at Block 514 using this pull rate.  Preferably, a pull late profile is used in Block 512 that maintains V/G midway between the critical ratios, so as to maintain a guard band that can account for typical process variations<br>
Pull Rate Profile by Axial Slieing<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, empirical determination of pull rate profiles using axial slicing will now be described   As shown in Figure 6. a reference ingot is purfied at a variable pull rate at Block 602   In order to determine a preferred pull rate profile, a range of pull rates is used, as illustrated in Figure 10   As shown in Figure 10, the pull rate is adjusted from a high pull rate (a), such as 1 2mm/min, to a low pull rate (c) of 0 5mm/min and back to a high pull rate   The low pull rate may be as low as 0 4mm/min or lower   The change in pull rate (b) and (d) is preferably linear   Ingots having cross-sections as shown in Figures 11 and 12 may be produced   Figures 11 and 12 illustrate vacancy rich, interstitial rich and perfect regions [V], [I] and [PJ, respectively in an ingot   It will be understood by those having skill in the art that these regions may have varying concentrations of agglomerates which are not shown by the line drawings of Figures 11 and 12<br>
Referring back to Figure 6, the ingot is axially sliced at Block 604   Thus, referring to Figure 11, for semi-pure silicon, the ingot is sliced axially, agglomerate concentrations are measured in the axial slice using conventional techniques such as copper decoration, secco-etching, X-Ray Topography analysis, lifetime measurements or other conventional techniques   Preferably, X-Ray Topography analysis, lifetime measurements is performed after the ingot is axially cut, mirror etched and annealed in a nitiogen environment for 4 hours at 800°C and for 16 hours at 1000°C   As shown in Figure 11, axial position P1 will have a large vacancy rich region and a relatively<br><br>
- 15-<br>
small perfect region   Axial position P2 has a smaller vacancy rich region and a larger perfect region   Axial position P3 has the smallest possible vacancy rich region and the largest possible perfect region, without introducing an interstitial agglomerate rich region. Axial position P4 has a very small vacancy rich region, but has a large interstitial rich region which is undesirable   Accordingly, at Block 608, the V/G is determined for axial position P3 based on its axial position along the ingot of Figure 11   At Block 610, a pull rate profile that satisfies V/G is then determined for this position P3 as the wafer is pulled, and ingots are then fabricated<br>
It will be understood by those having skill in the art that the axial position P3 may not be used in actual production because process variations may cause the growth of an interstitial region   Accordingly, an axial position between position P1_ and P3 may be selected so that an acceptably small vacancy rich region may be included without introducing interstitial agglomerates, notwithstanding process variations<br>
Axial ingot slicing may also be perfonned on an ingot pulled in a hot zone that is designed for pure silicon   Such an ingot is shown in Figute 12   As with Figure 11, vacancy rich, perfect and interstitial rich regions [V], [I] and [P| are shown   As shown in Figure 12, axial positions P5-P10 include vacancy rich central areas similar to those described in connection with Figure 11    Positions P7 and P10 include an interstitial rich ring and a perfect center   However, positions P6 and P9 are all perfect, because there are no vacancies at the center and no interstitials at the edge Accordingly, at Block 606, an axial position corresponding to positions P6 or P9 is selected and V/G is determined for this axial position at Block 608   A pull rate profile to maintain this V/G is determined at Block 610 and ingots are fabricated at Block 612   It will be understood by those having skill in the art that a range of axial positions adjacent positions P6 and P9 may be selected to produce pure silicon Accordingly, the actual V/G may be selected to allow for process variations while still maintaining perfect silicon characteristics<br>
Pull Rate Profile by Water Identification<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, empirical determination of pull rate profiles by wafer identification will now be described   As shown in Figure 7, a reference ingot is pulled at a variable pull rate at Block 702   In order to determine a pieferrcd pull rate profile, a range of pull rates is preferably used, as described in figure 10   For<br><br>
- 16-<br>
example, the pull rate is adjusted from a high pull rate (a), here 1 2mm/mm, to a low pull rate (c) of 0 5 mm/mm and back to a high pull rate   The low pull rate may be as low as 0 4mm/mm or lower   The change in pull rate (b) and (d) is preferably linear. An ingot having a cross-section as shown in Figure 11 or Figure 12 may be produced Referring back to Figure 7, the ingot is radially sliced at Block 704 to produce a plurality of wafers   Thus, referring to Figure 11, for semi-pure silicon, the ingot is sliced to provide representative wafers W1-W4   Agglomerate concentrations are then measured in these wafers using conventional techniques such as copper decoration, secco etching, lifetime measurements or other conventional techniques   As shown in Figure 11, wafer W1 will have a large vacancy rich region and a relatively small perfect region   Wafer W2 has a smaller vacancy rich region and a larger perfect region   Wafer W3 has the smallest possible vacancy rich region and the largest possible perfect region, without introducing an interstitial agglomerate rich region Wafer W4 has a very small vacancy rich region, but has a large interstitial rich region which is undesirable   Accordingly, at Block 708. V/G is determined for wafer W3 based on its axial position along the ingot of Figure 11    At Block 710, a pull rate profile is then determined for this wafer W3 as the wafer is pulled, and ingots are then fabricated<br>
It will be understood by those having skill in the art that the axial position of wafer W3 may not be used in actual production because process variations may cause the growth of an interstitial region   Accordingly, an axial position of a wafer between wafers W3 and W2 may be selected so that an acceptably small vacancy rich region may be included without introducing interstitial agglomerates, notwithstanding process variations<br>
Wafer slicing may also be performed on an ingot pulled in a hot zone that is designed for perfect silicon   Such an ingot is shown in Figure 12   As with Figure 11, vacancy rich, perfect and interstitial rich regions [V], [I] and [PJ are shown   As shown in Figure 12, a plurality of wafers W5-W10 may be produced   Wafers W5 and W10 include vacancy rich central areas similar to those described in connection with Figure 11    Waters W7 and W8 includide an mterstitial rich ring and a perfect center However, wafers W6 and W9 are all perfect, because there are no vacancies at the center and no interstitials at the edge   Accordingly, at Block 706, the axial position corresponding to wafer W6 or W9 is selected and V/G is determined for this axial position at Block 708   A pull rate profile to maintain the V/G is determined at Block<br><br>
- 17-<br>
710 and ingots are fabricated at Block 712   It will be understood by those having skill in the art that a range of wafer positions adjacent positions W6 and W9 may be selected to produce pure silicon. Accordingly, the actual V/G may be selected to allow for process variations while still maintaining perfect silicon characteristics<br>
Pull Rate Profile by Empirical and Simulation Techniques Referring now to Figure 8, a combination of simulation, axial slicing and<br>
wafer identification may be used in order to fabricate ingots according to the present invention   As shown in Figure 8 at Block 802, simulation may be used to determine a range of pull rates   At Block 804, a plurality of reference ingots may be grown Some of the ingots are axially sliced at Block 806, and some of the ingots are sliced into wafers at Block 808   The optimum V/G is determined by correlating the results of axial slicing, wafer identification and simulation at Block 810   A pull rate profile is then determined at Block 812 and ingots are fabricated at Block 814   This process may be performed twice to obtain pure silicon, so that the hot zone may be modified as necessary after obtaining semi-pure silicon<br>
The actual pull rate profile will depend on many variables, including but not limited to the desired diameter of ingot, the specific hot zone furnace that is being used and the quality of the silicon melt   Figures 13 and 14 illustratc pull rate profiles that were determined using a combination of simulation and emprtical techniques (Figure 8)   Figure 13 tllustrates a pull rate profile for growing a 100cm long, 200mm diameter ingot, to form a vacancy rich region of 12cm diameter and to provide a pure silicon region of 64% area   A Model Q41 hot zone furnace manufactured by Mitsubishi Material Ikuno was used   Figure 14 illustrates a pull rate profile to grow pure silicon, using the same ingot parameters as Figure 13 except that a modified hot zone of Figure 11 was used<br>
