				<td>MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having multiple<br>
planetary gear sets and at least six torque-transmitting mechanisms engagable in different<br>
combinations to provide seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Wide ratio transmissions such as seven or eight speed transmissions offer<br>
several advantages including improved vehicle acceleration performance and potentially<br>
improved fuel economy over four, five and six speed transmissions. However, increasing<br>
the number of speed ratios presents challenges in packaging additional clutches, drive<br>
mechanisms for the various gear members, and hydraulic circuit feed paths, and in<br>
ensuring an overall axial length that is acceptable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A multi-speed transmission offers seven forward speed ratios with a<br>
pleasing ratio step progression, with the seventh forward speed ratio offering a relatively<br>
large percentage of the ratio spread, relatively low pinion speeds and only light torque<br>
loading on gear members carrying torque in the seventh forward speed ratio due to a<br>
brake-type torque transmitting mechanism engaged in the seventh forward speed ratio.<br>
[0004]	More specifically, a multi-speed transmission within the scope of the<br>
invention has a first planetary gear set having a first, a second, and a third member. The<br>
first planetary gear set is representable as a three-node lever having a first, a second, and<br>
a third node corresponding with the first, the second, and the third member, respectively.<br>
The transmission also has a second, a third, and a fourth planetary gear set that have a<br>
fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, and an eighth member, with at least two of the second,<br>
third and fourth planetary gear sets intermeshing as a compound planetary gear set such<br>
that the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth members rotate in fixed relation to one<br>
another and are representable by a five-node lever having a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a<br><br>
seventh and an eighth node corresponding with the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth<br>
members, respectively. As used herein, gear members that "rotate in fixed relation to one<br>
another" are interconnected such that their rotational speeds relative to one another are<br>
fixed. The first through eighth members are sun gear members, carrier members and ring<br>
gear members. The first node is grounded to a stationary member, such as the<br>
transmission housing or casing. The third node is continuously connected for common<br>
rotation with the input member. The seventh node is continuously connected for<br>
common rotation with the output member. Six torque-transmitting mechanisms are<br>
selectively engagable in different combinations to establish seven forward speed ratios<br>
and a reverse speed ratio between the input member and the output member. Optionally,<br>
selective engagement of two of the torque-transmitting mechanisms establishes an<br>
additional forward speed ratio between the input member and the output member for a<br>
total of eight forward speed ratios.<br>
[0005]	The seven forward speed ratios include a first, a second, a third, a fourth, a<br>
fifth, a sixth and a seventh speed ratio between the input member and the output member.<br>
Preferably, the seventh forward speed ratio may be established by a single transition shift<br>
from the fourth, the fifth and the sixth speed ratios. Shifts between successive speed<br>
ratios also require single transition shifts. Thus, there is a simple, quick and appropriate<br>
transmission response to nearly any sudden throttle input. Only two torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms are engaged in each speed ratio, and only one is a rotating-type torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism in any given speed ratio. Minimizing the number of rotating-<br>
type clutches required enables simpler hydraulic controls.<br>
[0006]	There are many different transmission embodiments within the scope of<br>
the invention in which the planetary gear sets may include simple planetary gear sets,<br>
dual-pinion planetary gear sets, and a compound planetary gear set made up of two or<br>
three of the four planetary gear sets included in the transmission. In some embodiments,<br>
a first and a second interconnecting member connect different members of the planetary<br>
gear sets for common rotation. In some embodiments, the third brake-type torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism is positioned closer to the output member than any of the other<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br><br>
[0007]	Preferably, the six torque-transmitting mechanisms include a first rotating-<br>
type torque-transmitting mechanism that is selectively engagable to connect the second<br>
node for common rotation with the eighth node. A second rotating-type torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to connect the third node for common<br>
rotation with the sixth node. A third rotating-type torque-transmitting mechanism is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the second node for common rotation with the fourth<br>
node. A first brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to<br>
ground the fourth node to the stationary member. A second brake-type torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism is selectively engagable to ground the sixth node to the<br>
stationary member. A third brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism selectively<br>
engagable to ground the fifth node to the stationary member.<br>
[0008]	The seventh speed ratio is significantly higher than the sixth speed ratio,<br>
(with the exact percentage increase in speed ratio depending on the specific ring gear<br>
member to sun gear member speed ratios selected), and thus increases the overall speed<br>
ratio of the transmission by the same amount. The seventh speed ratio can thus be used<br>
to provide lower highway engine speeds and/or better performance at low speeds. The<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms engaged in the seventh (top) speed ratio handle<br>
relatively low amounts of torque and can thus be sized very compactly. The specific ring<br>
gear member to sun gear member tooth ratios may be selected to ensure a good ratio<br>
progression, low sun gear torques and low pinion speeds.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

invention shown in lever diagram form;<br><br>
[0011]	FIGURE 2 is a truth table showing an engagement schedule for the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms of the transmission of Figure 1 to establish seven forward speed<br>
ratios and a reverse speed ratio;<br>

of Figure 1;<br>
[0013]	FIGURE 4 is a second embodiment in stick diagram form of the<br>
transmission of Figure 1;<br>
[0014]	FIGURE 5 is a third embodiment in stick diagram form of the<br>
transmission of Figure 1; and<br>
[0015]	FIGURE 6 is a fourth embodiment in stick diagram form of the<br>
transmission of Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 illustrates a powertrain 10, schematically in lever diagram form,<br>
mounted on and partially forming a vehicle (not shown). The powertrain 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 connected to a transmission 14. The transmission 14 is designed to receive ,<br>
driving power from the engine 12, as discussed below. The engine 12 powers an input<br>
member 16 of the transmission 14. A final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an<br>
output member 17 of the transmission 14.<br>
[0017]	The transmission 14 includes a three-node lever 20 representing a first<br>
planetary gear set having a first, a second and a third member, represented by nodes A, B<br>
and C, respectively. The members may be a ring gear member, a sun gear member and a<br>
carrier member, although not necessarily in that order. Nodes, A, B and C are referred to<br>
in the claims as the first, second and third nodes, respectively. As used herein, a "node"<br>
is a component of a transmission, such as a ring gear member, a carrier member, or a sun<br>
gear member, which is characterized by a rotational speed and which can act as a junction<br>
of torques applied to that component from other components and by that component to<br>
other components. The other components which may interact with a given node include<br>
other coaxial members of the same set of planetary gears which appear as other nodes on<br><br>
the same lever. The other components which may interact with a given node also include<br>
interconnections to members of other planetary gear sets which appear as nodes on<br>
another lever, a stationary member such as the transmission case, and other transmission<br>
members.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 14 further includes a five-node lever 22 representing<br>
second, third and fourth planetary gear sets interconnected so as to be representable by<br>
nodes D, E, F, G and H, respectively. As those skilled in the art will readily understand,<br>
two or more planetary gear sets may be represented as a single lever in a lever diagram<br>
when two different members of one of the planetary gear sets are connected for common<br>
rotation with two different members of the other planetary gear set and/or when planetary<br>
gear sets intermesh as a compound planetary gear set. Each of the nodes D, E, F, G and<br>
H represent a ring gear member, a sun gear member, or a carrier member, although not<br>
necessarily in that order. Nodes D, E, F, G and H are referred to in the claims as the<br>
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth node, respectively.<br>
[0019]	The input member 16 is connected for common rotation with node C. The<br>
output member 17 is connected for common rotation with node G. Node A is<br>
continuously grounded to a stationary member 24.<br>
[0020]	The transmission 14 also has selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms that provide various speed ratios, as described below. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 50, a rotating-type clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node B for<br>
common rotation with node H. Torque-transmitting mechanism 52, also a rotating-type<br>
clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node C for common rotation with node F.<br>
Another torque-transmitting mechanism 54, a stationary clutch, also referred to as a<br>
brake-type toque-transmitting mechanism, is selectively engagable to ground node D to<br>
the stationary member 24. Torque-transmitting mechanism 56, a rotating-type clutch, is<br>
selectively engagable to connect node B for common rotation with node D. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 57, a stationary-type clutch, also referred to as a brake-type<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism, is selectively engagable to ground node F to the<br>
stationary member 24. Torque-transmitting mechanism 58, a stationary-type clutch, also<br><br>
referred to as a brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism, is selectively engagable to<br>
ground node E to the stationary member 24.<br>
[0021]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57 and 58 are<br>
selectively engagable in the different combinations of pairs, as illustrated in Figure 2, to<br>
provide a reverse speed ratio (REV), and seven forward speed ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,<br>
5th, 6th, and 7th). Each speed ratio established in Figure 2 may also be referred to as a<br>
"gear". Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the engagement of these<br>
different combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms shown in Figure 2 will result<br>
in seven forward speed ratios having different numerical values, as well as a reverse<br>
speed ratio.<br>
[0022]	Optionally, the transmission 14 may be operated as an eight-speed<br>
transmission if the torque-transmitting mechanisms 50 and 58 are engaged following the<br>
second speed ratio (2nd) to establish an additional forward speed ratio, not listed in the<br>
table of Figure 2, for a total of eight forward speed ratios.<br>
[0023]	A controller (not shown) is operatively connected with the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms and is programmed with an algorithm to select different ones of<br>
the speed ratios set forth in Figure 2 to provide seven forward speed ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd,<br>
4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) and the reverse speed ratio. Alternatively, less than seven of the<br>
forward speed ratios may also be selected, such as to enable a five-speed or six-speed<br>
transmission with single-transition shifts. The speed ratios chosen or permitted by the<br>
controller may depend upon whether single-transition shifts are desired. As used herein,<br>
a "single-transition shift" in the context of speed ratios established with pairs of engaged<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms means that one torque-transmitting mechanism remains<br>
engaged and another torque-transmitting mechanism is disengaged while a different<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged in shifting from one speed ratio to a<br>
subsequent speed ratio (whether in an upshift or a downshift). As is apparent from Figure<br>
2, the seven forward speed ratios 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th, are operable in<br>
progression with single-transition shifts. Additionally, there are multiple single-transition<br>
upshifts (shifts from a lower numbered speed ratio to a higher numbered speed ratio (i.e.,<br>
1 st to 2nd), which are shifts from a higher numerical speed ratio to a lower numerical<br><br>
speed ratio. For example, a shift from the fourth (4th), fifth (5th) or sixth (6th) forward<br>
speed ratio to the seventh (7th) forward speed ratio is a single transition shift.<br>
[0024]	The topology and ring gear member to sun gear member tooth ratios of a<br>
specific transmission embodiment implementing the lever diagram embodiment of<br>
Figure 1 will determine the most pleasing progression of the forward speed ratios for a<br>
given application and/or driving situation. Because each of the speed ratios established<br>
as set forth in Figure 2 require only two torque-transmitting mechanisms to be applied,<br>
and because most utilize only one rotating clutch (i.e., only one of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, and 56), hydraulic leakage losses are minimized, as these are more<br>
commonly encountered with rotating-type than with stationary-type torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figure 3, a powertrain 110 has a transmission 114 configured<br>
in accordance with and operable in like manner as the transmission 14 shown in lever<br>
diagram form in Figure 1. The powertrain 110 includes engine 12 powering an input<br>
member 116 of the transmission 114. Final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an<br>
output member 117 of the transmission 114.<br>
[0026]	The transmission 114 includes simple planetary gear sets 130 and 140, as<br>
well as planetary gear sets 150 and 160 interconnected to form a compound planetary<br>
gear set 150, 160. Planetary gear set 130 includes a sun gear member 132, a ring gear<br>
member 134, and a carrier member 136 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears<br>
137 that mesh with both the ring gear member 134 and the sun gear member 132.<br>
[0027]	Planetary gear set 140 includes a sun gear member 142, a ring gear<br>
member 144, and a carrier member 146 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears<br>
147 that mesh with both the ring gear member 144 and the sun gear member 142.<br>
[0028]	Compound planetary gear set 150, 160 includes planetary gear set 150<br>
having a sun gear member 152, a ring gear member 154 and a carrier member 156 that<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 157 that mesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 152 and the ring gear member 154. The pinion gears 157 are long pinion gears.<br>
The carrier member 156 also rotatably supports a second set of pinion gears 167 that are<br><br>
included in planetary gear set 160. Gear set 160 also includes sun gear member 162.<br>
Pinion gears 167 mesh with the pinion gears 157 and with the sun gear member 162.<br>
[0029]	The input member 116 is continuously connected for common rotation<br>
with the ring gear member 134. Sun gear member 132 is continuously grounded to a<br>
stationary member 124, such as a casing of the transmission 114. Ring gear member 154<br>
is continuously connected for common rotation with output member 117. An<br>
interconnecting member 170 continuously connects ring gear member 144 for common<br>
rotation with sun gear member 152. Interconnecting member 172 continuously connects<br>
sun gear member 142 for common rotation with carrier member 156.<br>
[0030]	The transmission 114 has six selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50A, 52A, 54A, 56A, 57A, and 58A, as well as a free-wheeling one-way<br>
clutch Fl A that is that is connected in parallel with torque-transmitting mechanism 57A<br>
and permits rotation in only one direction. Torque-transmitting mechanism 50A is a<br>
rotating-type clutch that is selectively engagable to connect carrier member 136 for<br>
common rotation with sun gear member 162. Torque-transmitting mechanism 52A is a<br>
rotating-type clutch that is selectively engagable to connect input member 116 and ring<br>
gear member 134 for common rotation with carrier member 156. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 54A is a brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism that is selectively<br>
engagable to ground ring gear member 144 with stationary member 124. Free-wheeling<br>
one-way clutch F1A prevents rotation of carrier member 156 in a direction opposite the<br>
input member 116. Torque-transmitting mechanism 56A a rotating-type clutch that is<br>
selectively engagable to connect carrier member 136 for common rotation with ring gear<br>
member 144 and sun gear member 152. Torque-transmitting mechanism 57A is a brake-<br>
type torque-transmitting mechanism that is selectively engagable to ground carrier<br>
member 156 to the stationary member 124. Torque-transmitting mechanism 58A is a<br>
brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism that is selectively engagable to ground carrier<br>
member 146 to the stationary member 124.<br>
[0031]	The members of transmission 114 correspond with the lever diagram<br>
transmission 14 of Figure 1 as follows: sun gear member 132 corresponds with node A;<br>
carrier member 136 corresponds with node B; ring gear member 134 corresponds with<br><br>
node C; interconnected ring gear member 144 and sun gear member 152 correspond with<br>
node D; carrier member 146 corresponds with node E; interconnected sun gear member<br>
142 and carrier member 156 correspond with node F; ring gear member 154 corresponds<br>
with node G; and sun gear member 162 corresponds with node H. The torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50A, 52A, 54A, 56A, 57A, and 58A correspond with torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 56, 57, and 58, respectively, and are engagable<br>
according to the same schedule of Figure 2 to achieve seven forward speed ratios and a<br>
reverse speed ratio (and, optionally, an eighth forward speed ratio by engaging torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50A and 58A).<br>
[0032]	One exemplary set of gear tooth counts for the transmission 114 is as<br>
follows: ring gear member 134: 89 teeth; sun gear member 132: 49 teeth; ring gear<br>
member 144: 97 teeth; sun gear member 142: 57 teeth; ring gear member 154: 87 teeth;<br>
sun gear member 152: 43 teeth; and sun gear member 162: 35 teeth. With the<br>
engagement schedule as set forth in Figure 2 for corresponding torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms, the following speed ratios are attained: reverse speed ratio (REV): -3.137;<br>
first forward speed ratio (1st): 3.854; second forward speed ratio (2nd): 2.313; third<br>
forward speed ratio (3rd): 1.551; fourth forward speed ratio (4th): 1.167; fifth forward<br>
speed ratio (5th): 0.851; sixth forward speed ratio (6th): 0.669; and seventh forward<br>
speed ratio (7th): 0.560. The following corresponding ratio steps are achieved: REV/1 st:<br>
-0.81; lst/2nd: 1.67; 2nd/3rd: 1.49; 3rd/4th: 1.33; 4th/5th: 1.37; 5th/6th: 1.27; and<br>
6th/7th: 1.19. This corresponds with an overall ratio spread (lst/7th) of 6.88. Depending<br>
on the tooth ratios utilized, the seventh speed ratio (7th) may be approximately 16 to 18<br>
percent higher than the sixth speed ratio (6th), with the sun gear member 142 handling<br>
about 15 percent of the torque on the input member 116 and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 58A only about 43 percent of the torque on the input member 116.<br>
[0033]	The highest speed for each set of pinions in any of the speed ratios with<br>
respect to the speed of the input member is as follows: pinion gears 137: 1.58; pinion<br>
gears 147: 1.158; pinion gears 157: 3.103; and pinion gears 167: 2.968. Planetary gear<br>
set 140 is lightly loaded, with its members carrying torque only during the seventh<br>
forward speed ratio due to engagement of brake-type torque-transmitting mechanism<br><br>
58 A. In the seventh forward speed ratio, the members of planetary gear set carry the<br>
following torque ratios with respect to the torque at the input member 116: sun gear<br>
member 142: 0.163; ring gear member 144: 0.277; and carrier member 146: -0.440.<br>
[0034]	Referring to Figure 4, a powertrain 210 has a transmission 214 configured<br>
in accordance with and operable in like manner as the transmission 14 shown in lever<br>
diagram form in Figure 1. The powertrain 210 includes engine 12 powering an input<br>
member 216 of the transmission 214. Final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an<br>
output member 217 of the transmission 214.<br>
[0035]	The transmission 214 includes simple planetary gear set 230, as well as<br>

Figure 2 for corresponding torque-transmitting mechanisms, the following speed ratios<br>
are attained: reverse speed ratio (REV): -3.192; first forward speed ratio (1st): 4.060;<br>
second forward speed ratio (2nd): 2.370; third forward speed ratio (3rd): 1.549; fourth<br>

planetary gear set 460 carry the following torque ratios with respect to the torque at the<br>
input member 416: sun gear member 462: -0.556; ring gear member 464: 1.000; and<br>

ratio (7th) may be approximately 20 to 100 percent higher than the sixth speed ratio (6th),<br>
with the sun gear member 462 and the torque-transmitting mechanism 58D handling only<br>
about 56 and 44 percent of the torque on the input member 116, respectively.<br>
