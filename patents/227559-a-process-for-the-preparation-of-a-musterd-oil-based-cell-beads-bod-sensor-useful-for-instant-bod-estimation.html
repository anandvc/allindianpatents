				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a mustard oil cell beads BOD sensor useful for instant BOD estimation. The cell beads comprise of a formulated, synergistic, immobilized microbial consortium.<br>
The problem of water pollution is increasing day by day with industrial development and urbanization. Many toxic and recalcitrant chemical compounds are being released in increasing amounts in the aquatic environment without proper treatment. The multitude of industries are by far the largest pollution creating units, whose discharges require a great degree of detoxification before they are released into the aquatic environment.<br>
Before diverting the industrial effluents for treatment, their monitoring is crucial. Monitoring is an essential tool for waste-water management, for it details the ambient or background pollution level. Till date, classical chemical or spectrophotometric methods, requiring long reaction time and complicated procedures are used for monitoring of parameters/compounds of environmental interest such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), heavy metals, pesticides, phenols, etc.<br>
Amongst all these, BOD is a key parameter in the monitoring of water quality and treatment. BOD is a measure of the oxygen demand in a sample as a result of its organic content. BOD plays a very crucial role in assessing the pollutional strength of waste-waters, as high BOD means high organic content which further implies an increased consumption of oxygen to decompose these organics. BOD test is still carried out by the conventional method which is very tedious and time consuming. The control of waste-water plants is difficult or even<br><br>
impossible using the classical determination method for BOD because of its high time consumption of five days.<br>
Thus, there arises a need for determining the BOD values within minutes which is possible only by using rapid BOD measuring devices. Sensors, which are devices that transduce a selective biochemical response into an electrical signal, can offer practical alternatives in environmental monitoring in terms of convenience, ability to reduce the reaction time and test system's complexity to a minimum and suitability for on-line applications.<br>
For environmental monitoring, microbial biosensors are extensively used as compared to enzyme sensors. This is so because cell based sensors show a high degree of stability and are able to perform complex reaction sequences. Moreover, microorganisms employed in microbial biosensors are relatively easy to maintain in pure cultures, grow up and harvest at low cost, circumventing the costly extraction and purification procedures prior to use as biocatalysts as in the case of enzyme based sensors. In addition, BOD sensing by rapid devices cannot be achieved using enzyme based sensors as BOD test is a sequence of complex reactions requiring an array of enzymes which are difficult to assemble at a time on a support. As evident from the literature, one report on whole cell based sensor for BOD estimation is available using single pure culture of microorganism (Su et al. 1986). The drawback of such developed cell beads sensor using single pure culture is that a single microbe is unable to assimilate all the organic matter present in the test sample; from either a single or a wide range of industries.<br>
For solving the aforementioned problems, the applicants have realized that there exists a need to provide a process for the preparation of a defined synergistic microbial consortium immobilized in a suitable support i.e., agarose, useful for instant BOD estimation.<br><br>
To overcome these problems, a number of bacterial strains have been used for the preparation of cell beads sensor individually as well as in combination. When the cell beads sensor using single microorganism was used for instant BOD estimation they did not serve the said purpose. On the other hand, if the cell beads are prepared using combinations of microorganisms having synergistic effect and used for instant BOD estimation, it may yield reproducible and reliable results. Besides, the immobilization support also plays a crucial role in determining the response time and sensitivity of the sensor. Greater is the shelf-life, stability and viability of the immobilized biocatalyst, better is the response.<br>
In the present invention, cell beads sensor has been developed by immobilizing the formulated microbial consortium on a suitable support i.e., agarose under a hydrophobic condition, useful for instant BOD estimation. The support used for the immobilization in the present invention confers high stability, viability and negligible leaching to the biocatalyst i.e., microorganisms. This can be attributed to the fact that the biocatalysts immobilized in hydrophilic supports under hydrophobic conditions confer least leaching to the immobilized biocatalyst.<br>
There is no prior art for the development of cell beads sensor using agarose as a support, for instant BOD estimation. On the contrary, there is only one report for the development of cell beads sensor for instant BOD estimation using supports other than agarose, such as K-carrageenan under hydrophilic conditions. The limitations of such developed sensor is that it is used only for the BOD estimation of glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) covering a very low range i.e., upto a concentration of 24mg/l. The cell beads BOD sensor developed in the present invention can instantly estimate BOD of higher GGA concentrations (i.e., upto 300 mg/1), covering a wide range of synthetic<br><br>
samples (peptone, glucose, glutamic acid and citric acid) as well as a range of highly, moderately and low biodegradable industrial effluents.<br>
The reproducibility of cell beads sensor can only be obtained if a defined microbial consortium is used as a biocatalyst, because sensors based on single organisms or microbial consortium isolated from activated sludge exhibit erroneous results. Further, they don't respond to higher GGA concentrations and a range of synthetic and industrial samples. Such specific microbial consortium based cell beads sensors may also find great applications in on-line monitoring of the degree of pollutional strength in a wide variety of industrial waste-waters within a very short time, which is very essential for combating the problem of water pollution. The said microbial consortium is capable of assimilating most of the organic matter present in different industrial effluents.<br>

The immobilized cell beads may contain the bacteria, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, in uniform amounts.<br>
The cell beads of the present invention are useful for instant BOD estimation.<br>
The bacterial cultures of the above immobilized cell beads are isolated from sewage. Sewage samples are collected from Dhirpur Sewage Treatment Plant, Delhi. Sewage is homogenized for 2 minutes and suspended in nutrient broth. Incubation is carried out for 24hours. Cultures are plated on nutrient agar. Colonies are mixed on a vortex mixer and all the cultures are isolated in pure form after several sub¬cultures.<br>
In the present invention, the cell beads are prepared by inoculating individual bacterial strains of the above mentioned bacteria separately in nutrient broth containing (per litre), 5.0 g peptic digest of animal tissue, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, 1.5 g of beef extract, 1.5 g yeast extract and 0.1 ml tween-80. Incubation of all the cultures is done preferably at a temperature of 37°C for approximately 12-24 hours, under gentle shaking. Optical density of all the cultures is measured at 620 nm after stipulated time intervals. After attaining sufficient growth on the basis of optical density, the individual cultures are mixed in equal proportions for formulating desired microbial consortium. The resultant cell suspension is centrifuged at an appropriate rpm for a period of 20 minutes at a temperature ranging between 1-10°C. The resultant pellet is washed by dissolving in minimum quantity of phosphate buffer, 50 mM, pH 6.8 and recentrifuged at an appropriate rpm, preferably at 8000 rpm for a period of approximately 20 minutes at a temperature ranging between 1-10°C. Immobilization of the obtained pellet is done using various supports such as agarose, sodium alginate, sodium alginate + polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).<br>
The formulated microbial consortium was immobilized in agarose by dissolving the pellet of individual microorganisms as well as of the formulated microbial consortium is dissolved in 1.0ml of phosphate buffer, 50mM, pH6.8 and then mixed with 3% agarose. The resultant cell slurry is extruded dropwise with the help of a 10 ml syringe in 250 ml of mustard oil kept at 4°C .The cell slurry is extruded as discrete<br>
droplets so as to form beads of appropriate size. The beads thus formed are washed with petroleum ether to remove the adhering oil and then washed with 50mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 three to five times. The immobilized microbial beads thus obtained are stored at a temperature preferably 4°C in 50mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 till further use.<br>
The immobilization of microbial consortium in sodium alginate is affected by mixing the cell pellet in 2% sodium alginate solution and extruding the resultant slurry into a stirred 12mM CaCla solution. The beads thus formed are left in 12mM CaCb solution for approximately 3 hours and later washed with 50mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The immobilized microbial beads are stored in 50 Mm CaCb solution at a temperature preferably at 4°C.<br>
For the preparation of beads in alginate + polyvinyl alcohol, 15% of polyvinyl alcohol and 2% sodium alginate were dissolved in sterilized 50mM phosphate buffer, pH6.8. The cell pellet is mixed with the above said solution and the resultant cell slurry is extruded drop wise with the help of a 10ml syringe in saturated boric acid solution. The beads are removed and kept in l.OM NaH2PO4 for 30-45 minutes for hardening. The immobilized microbial beads thus obtained are stored in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH6.8 at a temperature preferably 4°C.<br>
The viability, stability and leaching of the immobilized microbial beads is checked at regular time intervals. For checking the viability of the immobilized microbial beads, the beads are added in nutrient broth and incubated at 37°C, 120rpm for 6-8 hours. A loopful of the incubated broth is streaked on nutrient agar plates and incubated at 37°C overnight. The colonies are observed for growth on agar plates. For the stability studies the formulated microbial beads are stored at 4°C in 50mM phosphate buffer, pH6.8. Stability is observed in terms of response at regular time intervals. Leaching of the prepared beads is<br>
checked by measuring the optical density of the storage buffer at stipulated time intervals.<br>
For instant BOD estimation, known amount of the prepared cell beads is added into a continuously stirred 50mM phosphate buffer solution, pH6.8 with a dissolved oxygen probe immersed in the system. The experiment is set-up in a system, which is not of flow through type.<br>
The response was measured in terms of change in current, which was observed using an amperometric system consisting of a dissolved oxygen probe attached to a multimeter. For measuring the current an external polarization voltage of-0.65 volts was applied to the cathode.<br>
The immobilized cell beads were checked for their response in terms of change in current using GGA as a reference standard in BOD analysis. For this, the electrode is dipped in stirred phosphate buffer solution, 50mM, pH6.8 containing the immobilized microbial beads. After a stable current is obtained, known strength of GGA is injected into the reaction assembly. Consumption of oxygen by the microbial cells immobilized in beads causes a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the<br>
»<br>
system. This is elucidated by a gradual decrease in current until a stable value is attained. The steady state indicates that the consumption of oxygen by the immobilized cell beads and the diffusion of oxygen from the solution to the beads is in equilibrium. As observed in the present course of study, the change in current is linearly related to GGA standard over the range of 30-300 mg/1.<br>
The invention, further described with references to the examples given below and shall not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>

Optical density of all the cultures was maintained to 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifuging the bacterial suspension at 10,000rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellet obtained was suspended in 1.0-2.Oml of 10-100mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 and recentrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. The resultant pellet of individual bacteria was mixed with 3% agarose and extruded drop wise in castor oil kept at a temperature ranging between 4°C-8°C. The cell beads were first washed with petroleum ether and then rewashed 3-5 times with 10-100mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5- 7.5. The cell beads thus obtained were stored in 10-100mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5-7.5 at a temperature preferably at 4°C. The beads obtained were irregular in shape and had a tail.<br>

Example VII (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium I comprised of six bacterial strains namely, Aeromonas sobria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazaki, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloaca and was used for the preparation of cell beads. Instant BOD analysis of a range of GGA concentrations ranging from 30-300 mg/1 was carried out using the said cell beads. Table2 depicts the BOD values of GGA concentrations using the cell beads comprising the microbial consortium I.<br>
Example VIII (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium II comprised of five bacterial strains namely, Aeromonas sobria, Enterobacter sakazaki, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloaca and was used for the preparation of cell beads. The prepared cell beads were used for the instant BOD analysis of GGA concentrations ranging from 30-300 mg/1. Table2 depicts the BOD values of GGA concentrations using the cell beads comprising the microbial consortium I.<br>
Example IX (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium III comprised of four bacterial strains namely, Aeromonas sobria, Enterobacter sakazaki, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloaca and was used for the preparation of cell beads. The prepared cell beads were used for instant BOD estimation of GGA concentrations covering a range of 30-300 mg/1. Table2 shows BOD values of GGA upto a concentration of 300 mg/1 using the prepared cell beads.<br>
Example X (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium IV comprised of three bacterial strains namely, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloaca and was used for the preparation of cell beads. The prepared cell beads were used for the instant BOD analysis of GGA concentrations ranging from 30-300 mg/1. Table2 depicts the BOD values of GGA concentrations using the cell beads comprising the microbial consortium IV.<br>
Example XI (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium V comprised of three bacterial strains namely, Enterobacter sakazaki, Aeromonas sobria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was used for the preparation of cell beads. Instant BOD analysis of a range of GGA concentrations ranging from 30-300 mg/1 was carried out using the said cell beads. Table2 depicts the BOD values of GGA concentrations using the cell beads comprising the microbial consortium V.<br>
Example XII (Comparative example)<br>
Microbial consortium VI comprised of three bacterial strains namely, Enterobacter sakazaki, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloaca and was used for the preparation of cell beads. The prepared cell beads were used for instant BOD estimation of GGA concentrations covering a range of 30-300 mg/1. Table2 shows BOD values of GGA upto a concentration of 300 mg/1 using the prepared cell beads.<br><br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example XIII<br>
Out of the six microbial consortia formulated for the preparation of cell beads, microbial consortium V comprising of the bacterial strains, namely, Enterobacter sakazaki, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas sobria was selected on the basis of the BOD values of GGA (30-300mg/l) for further study.<br>
Storage  conditions of the selected cell beads Example XIV<br>
The selected immobilized microbial consortium was stored at different temperatures i.e., 4°C to 37°C for stability and viability studies.<br>
It was observed that the cell beads stored at 4°C were more stable than the cell beads stored at other temperatures. In addition, the cell beads stored at 4°C were more viable in comparison to beads stored at temperature higher than 4°C.<br>
Instant   BOD   analysis   of  synthetic   samples using the selected cell beads sensor Example XV<br>
Cell beads selected for the present invention were used for the instant BOD estimation of different synthetic samples, e.g., glucose, glutamic acid, peptone and citric acid as described in example IV. 3000mg/l each of the respective synthetic samples were used for instant BOD estimation.<br>
TableS represents the BOD values of the above mentioned synthetic samples using the cell beads sensor. All the experiments of the present invention were carried out three times to obtain reproducibility and the mean values of all the experiments were taken into consideration. The results obtained were compared with BOD values obtained using the conventional method.<br><br>

Instant   BOD   analysis   of  industrial   samples using the selected cell beads sensor Example XVI<br>
The selected cell beads of the present invention were also used for the instant BOD estimation of a wide range of industrial samples covering low, moderate and highly biodegradable organic matter as described in example IV. The samples were collected afresh for instant BOD estimation. Table4 represents that BOD values of all the industrial waste-waters used for the study by selected cell beads BOD sensor.<br>

Advantages ;<br>
1.	The prepared immobilized cell beads when used in conjunction<br>
with an electronic device are capable of determining the BOD<br>
load    of   waste-waters    instantly i.e., within    30-45 minutes as<br>
compared to the conventional method which gives BOD values<br>
within 3-5 days.<br>
2.	The   formulated   selected microbial   consortium of cell beads acts<br>
in a synergistic   way   and   is   capable   of   assimilating   a   vast<br>
array   of   organic   compounds   present   in   different   types   of<br>
industrial effluents.<br>
3.	The method of gelling agarose in cold mustard oil, described in<br>
the invention, is novel and cost effective.<br>
4.	The   method   adopted   for immobilizing   the   microorganisms   is<br>
entrapment, which causes least physical and chemical damage<br>
to the immobilized entity.<br>
5.	The  support used  for immobilization  i.e.   agarose  is  non-toxic<br>
to    micro-organisms. Moreover, agarose is not utilizable by the<br>
microbial   consortium  in  use,   thereby  not  adding  to   BOD   of<br>
the sample in any way.<br>
6.	The prepared    immobilized    cell beads    have    long    stability,<br>
viability   and   negligible   leaching   as   compared   to cell beads<br>
prepared using other supports.<br>
7.	The   immobilized   microbial   beads   described   in   the   invention<br>
do   not   act   as   barrier   for   the   diffusion   of  oxygen   through<br>
them, thereby aiding in instant BOD estimation.<br><br><br><br><br>
