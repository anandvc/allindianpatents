COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"ACTIVE COMPOUND COMPOSITION, COMPRISING TRIFLOXYSTROBIN<br>
COMPOUND"<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AG, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, of Alfred-Nobel-Strasse 50, 40789 Monheim, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the  invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
94-MUMNP-2004<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to active compound composition, comprising trifloxystrobin compound.<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising a known oxime ether derivative and known insecticidally active compounds, which combinations are highly suitable for controlling phytopathogenic fungi and insects.<br>
4<br>
It is already known that methyl 2-[a-{[(a-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-benz-yl)imino]oxy}-o-tolyl]-glyoxylate O-methyl oxime has fungicidal properties (cf. EP-Al-460 575). The activity of this substance is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that imidacloprid (cf. EP-A-192 060 or Pesticide Manual, 9th Edition (1991), page 491), thiacloprid (cf. EP-A-235 725), acetamiprid (WO 91/04965), nitenpyram (cf. EP-A-302 389), thiamethoxam (cf. EP-A-580 533), clothianidin (cf. EP-A-376 279) and dinotefuran (cf. EP-A-649845) have insecticidal properties. The activity of these substances is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
It has now been found that the novel active compound combinations of methyl 2-[a-<br>
{[(a-memyl-3-trifluoromemylber)2yl)irnino]oxy}-o-tolyl]-glyoxylate	O-methyl<br>
oxime of the formula (I)<br><br>
and<br>
(1)       l-[(6-cMoro-3-pyridmyl)memyl]-N-m^o-2-irrn^azoHdmeiniine (reference: EP-A-192 060) of the formula (II)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
have very good fungicidal and insecticidal properties.<br>
Surprisingly,  the  fungicidal  and  insecticidal  action  of the  active  compound<br>
5	combinations according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the<br>
actions of the individual active compounds. What is present is therefore an unforeseeable true synergistic effect and not just a combination of actions.<br>
As can be seen from the structural formula of the active compound of the formula (I),<br>
10	the compound can be present as E or Z isomer. The product can therefore be present<br>
as a mixture of different isomers or else in the form of a single isomer. Preference is given to compounds of the formula (I) in which the compound of the formula (I) is present as E isomer.<br>
15	The active compound of the formula (I) is known (compare, for example, EP-A1-460<br>
575). The active compounds of the formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) and (VIII) are likewise known (cf. the given references).<br>
In addition to at least one active compound of the formula (I), the active compound<br>
20	combinations according to the invention comprise the active compound imidacloprid.<br>
Additionally, they may also comprise further fungicidally or insecticidally active components.<br>
The synergistic effect is particularly pronounced when the active compounds in the<br>
25	active compound combinations according to the invention are present in certain<br>
weight ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively wide range.<br>
In general, 30<br><br>
from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 2 parts by weight, of active compound of the formula (II),<br>
from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active<br>
5	compound of the formula (III),<br>
from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active compound of the formula (IV),<br>
10	from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active<br>
compound of the formula (V),<br>
              from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active     compound of the formula (VI), 15<br>
from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active compound of the formula (VII),<br>
from 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active<br>
20	compound of the formula (VIII),<br>
are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The  active  compound  combinations   according  to  the  invention  have  potent<br>
25	microbicidal    activity   and   can   be   employed    for   controlling   undesirable<br>
microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, in crop protection and in the protection of materials.<br>
Fungicides can be employed in crop protection for controlling Plasmodiophoro-<br>
30	mycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomy-<br>
cetes and Deuteromycetes.<br><br>
Bactericides can be employed in crop protection for controlling Pseudomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae and Streptomycetaceae.<br>

25	(conidia form: Drechslera, syn: Helminthosporium);<br>
Uromyces species, such as, for example, Uromyces appendiculatus;<br>
Puccinia species, such as, for example, Puccinia recondita;<br>
Sclerotinia species, such as, for example, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum;<br>
Tilletia species, such as, for example, Tilletia caries;<br>
30	Ustilago species, such as, for example, Ustilago nuda or Ustilago avenae;<br>
Pellicularia species, such as, for example, Pellicularia sasakii;<br><br>

The active compound combinations according to the invention also have very good fortifying action in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
15	In  the present context,  plant-fortifying  (resistance-inducing)  active compound<br>
combinations and/or substances are to be understood as meaning those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with undesirable microorganisms, they show substantial resistance against these microorganisms.<br>
20<br>
In the present case, undesirable microorganisms are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Accordingly, the substances according to the invention can be used to protect plants for a certain period after the treatment against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period for which protection is<br>
25	provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the treat-<br>
ment of the plants with the active compound combinations.<br>
The fact that the active compound combinations are well tolerated by plants at the<br>
concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-<br>
30	ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br><br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used with particularly good<br>
results for controlling diseases in rice, such as, for example, Pyricularia and<br>
Rhizoctonia, foliar and ear diseases in cereals, in particular Leptosphaeria, Septoria,<br>
Pyrenophora spp., Erysiphe, Puccinia, Fusarium spp., Microdochium nivale,<br>
5	Rhizoctonia spp; diseases of vegetables and potatoes, such as, for example, Cercospora,<br>
Rhizoctonia, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Puccinia,<br>
Mycosphaerella, Phoma, Leveillula, Phytophthora, Pseudoperonospora, Botrytis, and<br>
against fungal attack in fruits including citrus fruits, such as, for example, Elsinoe,<br>
Gloedes, Venturia, Alternaria, Coccomyces, Diaporthe, Gymnosporangium,<br>
10	Mycosphaerella, Phoma, Monilinia, and also fungal diseases in grapevines, tea,<br>
tobacco, hops, coffee, bananas, nuts and ornamental plants, for example Uncinula and Plasmopara on grapevines, Cercospora, Colletotrichum, Mycosphaerella, Phoma, Alternaria.<br>
15	The active compound combinations according to the invention are also suitable for<br>
increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants<br>
20	are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired<br>
and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants).<br>
Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and<br>
optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the<br>
25	plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts<br>
of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts<br>
and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be<br>
mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br>
and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and<br>
30	vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br><br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and parts of plants with the<br>
active compound combinations  is  carried  out directly  or by action on their<br>
environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for<br>
5	example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on<br>
and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
In the protection of materials, the active compound combinations according to the<br>
10	invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with,<br>
and destruction by, undesired microorganisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial<br>
15	materials which are intended to be protected by active compounds according to the<br>
invention from microbial change or destruction can be adhesives, sizes, paper and board, textiles, leather, wood, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, microorganisms. Parts of production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which may be impaired by the<br>
20	proliferation of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the<br>
materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned within the scope of the present invention are preferably adhesives, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids, particularly preferably wood.<br>
25<br>
Microorganisms capable of degrading or changing the industrial materials which may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active compounds according to the invention preferably act against fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes),<br>
30	and against slime organisms and algae.<br><br>
Microorganisms of the following genera may be mentioned as examples:<br>
Altemaria, such as Alternaria tenuis,<br>
Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
5	Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana,<br>
Lentinus, such as Lentinus tigrinus,<br>
Penicillium, such as Penicillium glaucum,<br>
Polyporus, such as Polyporus versicolor,<br>
Aureobasidium, such as Aureobasidium pullulans,<br>
10	Sclerophoma, such as Sclerophoma pityophila,<br>
Trichoderma, such as Trichoderma viride,<br>
Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and<br>
Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus. 15<br>
Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active<br>
compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols and<br>
microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds,<br>
20	and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is<br>
25	emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it<br>
is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
30	such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as<br>
butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br><br>
ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as<br>
dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous<br>
extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at<br>
standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol<br>
5	propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and<br>
carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates.   Suitable  solid  carriers   for  granules   are:   for  example  crushed  and<br>
10	fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or<br>
else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for<br>
15	example    alkylaryl    polyglycol    ethers,    alkylsulphonates,     alkyl    sulphates,<br>
arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
20	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
25	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
30	The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used as such or<br>
in their formulations, also in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides,<br>
acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, to broaden, for example, the activity spectrum<br>
5	or to prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are<br>
obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
5	In addition, the active compound combinations according to the invention also have<br>
very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity<br>
spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi<br>
(for example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata),<br>
and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and<br>
10	Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their<br>
15	formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions,<br>
suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules.<br>
Application is carried out in a customary manner, for example by watering, spraying,<br>
atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to<br>
apply the active compound combinations by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject<br>
20	the active compound preparation or the active compound combination itself into the<br>
soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the plants.<br>
When using the active compound combinations according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range,<br>
25	depending on the kind of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active<br>
compound combination application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound combination application rates are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the<br>
30	soil, the active compound combination application rates are generally between 0.1<br>
and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or<br>
5	protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
10<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding,  by mutagenesis  or by<br>
15	recombinant DNA techniques. This can be varieties, bio- and genotypes<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
20	reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the active compound combination which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
25	yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products,<br>
better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
30	which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants<br>
which,  in the  genetic  modification,  received  genetic  material  which  imparts<br><br>
particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are<br>
better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
5	a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, nematodes, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain<br>
10	herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be<br>
mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are the<br>
15	increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in<br>
particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CryIA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the<br>
20	increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired<br>
resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors, and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally   active   compounds,   for   example   imidazolinones,   sulphonylureas,<br>
25	glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes in question<br>
which impart the desired traits can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans),<br>
30	KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard®<br>
(cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant<br><br>
plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean<br>
varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to<br>
glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and<br>
5	STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants<br>
(plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be<br>
mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example<br>
maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still-<br>
to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the<br>
10	future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compound combination also apply to the treatment of these plants.<br>
15<br>
The active compound combinations are suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes, found in agriculture, in forests, in the protection of stored products and materials and in the hygiene sector, and they are tolerated well by plants and have favourable homeotherm toxicity. They can<br>
20	preferably be used as crop protection compositions. They are active against normally<br>
sensitive and resistant species, and against all or individual developmental stages. The abovementioned pests include:<br>

Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living<br>
30	materials such as, preferably, polymers, adhesives, glues, paper and board, leather,<br>
wood, timber products and paints.<br><br>
The material which is to be protected from insect attack is very particularly preferably wood and timber products.<br>
5	Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to<br>
the invention, or mixtures comprising it, are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties,<br>
vehicles made of wood, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging,<br>
10	windows and doors made of wood, plywood, chipboard, joinery, or timber products<br>
which quite generally are used in house construction or building joinery.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates<br>
or   generally   customary   formulations   such   as   powders,   granules,   solutions,<br>
15	suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The abovementioned formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se, for<br>
example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent,<br>
emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellant, if desired desiccants<br>
20	and UV stabilizers, and if desired colorants and pigments and other processing<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for protecting wood and timber<br>
products comprise the active compound combination according to the invention in a<br>
25	concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the species and the<br>
abundance of the insects and on the medium. The optimal quantity to be employed<br>
can be determined in each case by test series upon application. In general, however, it<br>
30	will suffice to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight,<br>
of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br><br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture<br>
and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility<br>
and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if<br>
5	appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents<br>
with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably<br>
above 45°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low<br>
10	volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or<br>
mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of<br>
15	170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum and<br>
aromatics with a boiling range of 160 to 280°C, oil of turpentine, and the like are advantageously used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180<br>
20	to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a<br>
boiling range of 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation<br>
25	number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45 °C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture. 30<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organochemical solvents which contain hydroxy! and/or ester and/or ether groups are preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like. 5<br>
Organochemical binders used for the purposes of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and which can be diluted in water and/or dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate<br>
10	resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation<br>
or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
15<br>
The synthetic resin employed as binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances may also be used as binders, in amounts of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellants, odour-masking agents, and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like,<br>
20	all of which are known per se, can be employed.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the composition or the concentrate preferably<br>
comprises, as organochemical binders, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins which are preferably used in<br>
25	accordance with the invention are those with an oil content of over 45% by weight,<br>
preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or<br>
plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the<br>
30	active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace<br>
0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br><br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl<br>
phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as<br>
tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl)-adipate, stearates such as<br>
5	butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-<br>
molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones such as benzophenone and ethylenebenzophenone. 10<br>
Other suitable solvents or diluents are, in particular, water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
15	Particularly effective timber protection is achieved by industrial-scale impregnating<br>
processes, for example the vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate,<br>
and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate. 20<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides<br>
mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an<br>
explicit constituent of the present application.<br>
Especially preferred mixing partners which may be mentioned are insecticides, such<br>

be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or<br>
brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling<br>
5	systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from<br>
the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum<br>
species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as<br>
10	Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br>
consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent stops in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
15	by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations<br>

Furthermore, the paints may comprise plasticizers, modifiers which affect the rheological properties and other conventional constituents. The compounds<br>
25	according to the invention or the abovementioned mixtures may also be incorporated<br>

10	Y        is the efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when employing<br>
active compound B in a concentration of n ppm, and<br>

If the actual fungicidal and insecticidal activity exceeds the calculated value, the<br>
activity of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this<br>
case, the actually observed efficacy must exceed the value calculated for the expected<br>
20	efficacy (E) using the above formula.<br><br>
Example A<br>
Aphis gossypii test<br>
5	Solvent:	7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier:	2 parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the<br>
10	concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentrations.<br>
Cotton leaves (Gossypium hirsutum) which are heavily infested by the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration. 15<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all aphids have been killed; 0% means that none of the aphids have been killed. The kill rates that have been determined are evaluated using Colby's formula.<br>
20	In this test, for example, the following active compound combination in accordance<br>
