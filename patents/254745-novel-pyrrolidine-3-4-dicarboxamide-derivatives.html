Further, the invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of the above compounds, pharmaceutical preparations which contain such compounds as well as the use of these compounds for the production of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are active compounds and inhibit the coagulation factor Xa. These compounds consequently influence blood coagulation. They therefore inhibit the formation of thrombi and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of thrombotic disorders, such as amongst others, arterial and venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, stroke (cerebral thrombosis) due to atrial fibrillation, inflammation and arteriosclerosis. They have potentially benefit in the treatment of acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and restenosis, e.g. after transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass grafting of the coronary or peripheral arteries and in the maintenance of vascular access patency in long term hemodialysis patients. F.Xa inhibitors of this invention may form part of a combination therapy with an anticoagulant with a different mode of action or with a platelet aggregation inhibitor or with a thrombolytic agent. Furthermore, these compounds have an effect on tumour cells and prevent metastases. They can therefore also be used as antitumour agents.<br><br>
Other inhibitors of factor Xa, which are not structurally related to the compounds of the present invention, had previously been suggested for the inhibition of the formation of thrombi and for the treatment of related diseases (WO 03/045912). However, there is still a need for novel factor Xa inhibitors which exhibit improved pharmacological properties, e.g. an improved selectivity towards coagulation factor Xa.<br>
The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which are factor Xa inhibitors The compounds of the present invention unexpectedly inhibit coagulation factor Xa and also exhibit unproved pharmacological properties compared to other compounds already known in the art.<br>

General synthetic processes.<br>
1. Synthesis of pym&gt;Bdine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid scaffolds:<br><br>
General Procedure:<br>
An N-protected glycine derivative such as e.g. N-benzyl glycine is condensed with a source for formaldehyde like paraformaldehyde in a suitable solvent like benzene, toluene, xylene, DMF&gt; DMA, DMSO or acetonitrile at elevated temperatures between 60-150 °C to the corresponding azomethine ylide. This species undergoes cycloaddition reactions with a suitable ester of fumaric acid like the corresponding diethyl ester or dimethyl ester in a one-pot procedure to yield the corresponding N-protected trans racemic mixture of pyrrolidine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid diesters. The N-protecting group is changed to the corresponding Boc- or Z-protecting group via cleavage of the first N-pxotecting group via e.g. catalytical hydrogenation. For this the protected pyrrolidine is dissolved in a suitable solvent like methanol, ethanol, THF or ethyl acetate followed by addition of a catalyst like Pd/C (e.g. 10%) to the mixture. After that a hydrogen atmosphere is generated to cleave the first N-protecting group. The free amine is then again protected by addition of B0C2O or Z-Cl, respectively.<br>
The last step is the complete saponification of the diester to the corresponding diadd. The pyrrolidine diester is dissolved in suitable solvent system like methanol, ethanols THF, l,4-dioxane&gt; water or mixtures thereof and a base like LiOH, NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3 or CS2CO3 is added. Monohydrolysis can be performed<br><br>
using enantioselective enzymes or chiral bases in suitable solvents already described ox in buffered aqueous systems.<br>
2, Modifactions of pyrrolidine scaffolds:<br>
a) Starting from N'Boc-pyrrolidine-3&gt;4-dicarboxylic acids, introduction of R2-NH-R3<br><br>
General Procedure:<br>
N-protected pyrrolidine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid is dissolved in a suitable solvent like dichloromethane, DMF, acetonitrile, THF, NMP, DMA, etc, and activated with an amide coupling reagent like EDC, DIC, DCC, CDI, TBTU, HBTU, EEDQ, CIP, HOBt, HATU, PyBOP, PyBrOP, BOP, BOP-C1, TFFH, etc. at -10°C - 120°C. By adding one to two equivalents of the amine R -NH-R the corresponding monoamide is obtained after reaction for 0.5-120 h at -10°C to 120 °C. Repetition of this reaction by using the same coupling reagents as mentioned above or transformation of the acid into the corresponding acid chloride or anhydride by means of oxalyl chloride, thionylchloride, isobutylcarbamoyl chloride or related reagents, with R4-NH-Y yields the corresponding diamide.<br>
After deprotection under standard conditions like treatment with acids (e.g. HC1, trifluoracetic acid, HBr in glacial acetic acid) or hydrogenation in the case of the Z-protecting group the unprotected pyrrolidine-l,3-dicarboxamide is reacted "with suitable reagents to introduce R1. Suitable reagents LG-R include alkylhalogenides (chlorides, bromides, iodides), -trifLates, -para-nitrophenolates, -mesylates, acidchlorides, sulfonic acid chlorides, carbamoylchlorides, sulfamides, sulfamidoylchlorides, aldehydes, ketones etc. and can be reacted in solvents like<br><br>

The inhibition of the coagulation factor Xaby the compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated with the aid of a chromogenic peptide substrate assay as described hereinafter.<br>
Factor Xa activity was measured spectrophotometrically in microtiter plates in a final volume of 150 pi using the following conditions: Inhibition of human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was tested at an enzyme concentration of 3 nM using the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix AB, Molndal, Sweden) at 200 nM. The reaction kinetics of lite enzyme and the substrate were linear with both time and the enzyme concentration. The inhibitors were dissolved<br>
in DMSO and tested at various concentrations up to 100 pM. The inhibitors were diluted using HNPT buffer consisting of HEPES lOOmM, NaCl 140mM, PEG 6000 0.1%-and Tween 80 0.02%, pH 7.8. The cleavage of S-2222 by human factor Xa was followed at 405 nm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The velocity of the reaction was determined by the autoreader from the slope of the linear regression fit to 7 time points (1 minute). The initial velocity for each inhibitor concentration was determined by the slope of at least 4 time points in the linear phase by a linear regression fit (mOD/min ). Apparent dissociation constants K* were calculated according to Cheng and Prusoff [Cheng, Y. G; Prusoff, W. H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (KO and the concentration of the inhibitor that causes 50 percent inhibition (IC50) of an enzyme reaction. Biochem. Pharmacol 1973,22, 3099-3108.] based on the IC50 and the respective Km, determined previously (K* = IC50/ (1+S/Km)). The Km for the substrate used was determined under the conditions of the test with at least 5 substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 times Km. [Lottenberg R, Hall JA, Blinder M&gt; Binder EP, Jackson CM., The action of thrombin on peptide p-nitroanilide substrates. Substrate selectivity and examination of hydrolysis under different reaction conditions. Biochim Biophys Ada. 1983 Feb 15; 742(3):539-57]. according to Eadie [Eadie G.S. The inhibition of cholinesterase by physostigmine and prostigmine. J. Biol. Chem, 1942,146, 85-93.].<br>
The Km for S-2222 amounted to 613 fiM.<br><br>
The activity of the low molecular weight substances can, moreover be characterized in the "prothrombin time" (PT) clotting test. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent Thereafter, 0.25 ml of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) was placed in the instrument-specific sample container. In each case 5 yd of each dilution of the substance-dilution series was then mixed with the plasma provided. This plasma/inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes. Thereafter, there were pipetted to the semi-automatic device (ACL, Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Instrument Laboratory)) 50 pi of plasma/ inhibitor mixture in the measurement container. The clotting reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of Dade® Innovin® (recombinant human tissue factor combined with calcium buffer and synthetic phospholipids, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4212-50). The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the PT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can furthermore be characterised by the Activated Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT). This coagulation test can e.g. be run on the ACL 300 Coagulation System (Instrumentation Laboratory) automatic analyzer. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent. The test is performed with the Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent (purified soy phosphatides in l.OxlO^M ellagic acid, stabilizers and preservative, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4218-100) Thereafter, 0.25 ml aliquots of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) are spiked with 5 pi of test compound in at least 6 concentrations. 50 pi plasma at 4°C containing 1/50 vol. inhibitor in solvent are incubated with 50 pi Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent in water at 37°C for 3 min., then 50 pi CaCl2.2H2O 25 mM in water at 37°C are added. The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the APTT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The Ki values of the active compounds of the present invention preferably amount to about 0.001 to 50 pM, especially about 0.001 to 1 jiM. The PT values preferably amount to about 1 to 100 pM, especially to about 1 to 10 pM. The aPTT values preferably amount to about 1 to 100 pM, especially to about 1 to 10 pM.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally* e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid<br><br>
waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about 1 to 300 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br><br>

The compounds of formula (I) are active compounds and inhibit the coagulation factor Xa. These compounds consequently influence blood coagulation. They therefore inhibit the formation of thrombi and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of thrombotic disorders, such as amongst others, arterial and venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, stroke (cerebral thrombosis) due to atrial fibrillation, inflammation and arteriosclerosis. They have potentially benefit in the treatment of acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and restenosis, e.g. after transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass grafting of the coronary or peripheral arteries and in the maintenance of vascular access patency in long term hemodialysis patients. F.Xa inhibitors of this invention may form part of a combination therapy with an anticoagulant with a different mode of action or with a platelet aggregation inhibitor or with a thrombolytic agent. Furthermore, these compounds have an effect on tumour cells and prevent metastases. They can therefore also be used as antitumour agents.<br><br>
Other inhibitors of factor Xa, which are not structurally related to the compounds of the present invention, had previously been suggested for the inhibition of the formation of thrombi and for the treatment of related diseases (WO 03/045912). However, there is still a need for novel factor Xa inhibitors which exhibit improved pharmacological properties, e.g. an improved selectivity towards coagulation factor Xa.<br>
The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which are factor Xa inhibitors The compounds of the present invention unexpectedly inhibit coagulation factor Xa and also exhibit unproved pharmacological properties compared to other compounds already known in the art.<br>

General synthetic processes.<br>
1. Synthesis of pym&gt;Bdine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid scaffolds:<br><br>
General Procedure:<br>
An N-protected glycine derivative such as e.g. N-benzyl glycine is condensed with a source for formaldehyde like paraformaldehyde in a suitable solvent like benzene, toluene, xylene, DMF&gt; DMA, DMSO or acetonitrile at elevated temperatures between 60-150 °C to the corresponding azomethine ylide. This species undergoes cycloaddition reactions with a suitable ester of fumaric acid like the corresponding diethyl ester or dimethyl ester in a one-pot procedure to yield the corresponding N-protected trans racemic mixture of pyrrolidine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid diesters. The N-protecting group is changed to the corresponding Boc- or Z-protecting group via cleavage of the first N-pxotecting group via e.g. catalytical hydrogenation. For this the protected pyrrolidine is dissolved in a suitable solvent like methanol, ethanol, THF or ethyl acetate followed by addition of a catalyst like Pd/C (e.g. 10%) to the mixture. After that a hydrogen atmosphere is generated to cleave the first N-protecting group. The free amine is then again protected by addition of B0C2O or Z-Cl, respectively.<br>
The last step is the complete saponification of the diester to the corresponding diadd. The pyrrolidine diester is dissolved in suitable solvent system like methanol, ethanols THF, l,4-dioxane&gt; water or mixtures thereof and a base like LiOH, NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3 or CS2CO3 is added. Monohydrolysis can be performed<br><br>
using enantioselective enzymes or chiral bases in suitable solvents already described ox in buffered aqueous systems.<br>
2, Modifactions of pyrrolidine scaffolds:<br>
a) Starting from N'Boc-pyrrolidine-3&gt;4-dicarboxylic acids, introduction of R2-NH-R3<br><br>
General Procedure:<br>
N-protected pyrrolidine-3,4-dicarboxylic acid is dissolved in a suitable solvent like dichloromethane, DMF, acetonitrile, THF, NMP, DMA, etc, and activated with an amide coupling reagent like EDC, DIC, DCC, CDI, TBTU, HBTU, EEDQ, CIP, HOBt, HATU, PyBOP, PyBrOP, BOP, BOP-C1, TFFH, etc. at -10°C - 120°C. By adding one to two equivalents of the amine R -NH-R the corresponding monoamide is obtained after reaction for 0.5-120 h at -10°C to 120 °C. Repetition of this reaction by using the same coupling reagents as mentioned above or transformation of the acid into the corresponding acid chloride or anhydride by means of oxalyl chloride, thionylchloride, isobutylcarbamoyl chloride or related reagents, with R4-NH-Y yields the corresponding diamide.<br>
After deprotection under standard conditions like treatment with acids (e.g. HC1, trifluoracetic acid, HBr in glacial acetic acid) or hydrogenation in the case of the Z-protecting group the unprotected pyrrolidine-l,3-dicarboxamide is reacted "with suitable reagents to introduce R1. Suitable reagents LG-R include alkylhalogenides (chlorides, bromides, iodides), -trifLates, -para-nitrophenolates, -mesylates, acidchlorides, sulfonic acid chlorides, carbamoylchlorides, sulfamides, sulfamidoylchlorides, aldehydes, ketones etc. and can be reacted in solvents like<br><br>

The inhibition of the coagulation factor Xaby the compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated with the aid of a chromogenic peptide substrate assay as described hereinafter.<br>
Factor Xa activity was measured spectrophotometrically in microtiter plates in a final volume of 150 pi using the following conditions: Inhibition of human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was tested at an enzyme concentration of 3 nM using the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix AB, Molndal, Sweden) at 200 nM. The reaction kinetics of lite enzyme and the substrate were linear with both time and the enzyme concentration. The inhibitors were dissolved<br>
in DMSO and tested at various concentrations up to 100 pM. The inhibitors were diluted using HNPT buffer consisting of HEPES lOOmM, NaCl 140mM, PEG 6000 0.1%-and Tween 80 0.02%, pH 7.8. The cleavage of S-2222 by human factor Xa was followed at 405 nm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The velocity of the reaction was determined by the autoreader from the slope of the linear regression fit to 7 time points (1 minute). The initial velocity for each inhibitor concentration was determined by the slope of at least 4 time points in the linear phase by a linear regression fit (mOD/min ). Apparent dissociation constants K* were calculated according to Cheng and Prusoff [Cheng, Y. G; Prusoff, W. H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (KO and the concentration of the inhibitor that causes 50 percent inhibition (IC50) of an enzyme reaction. Biochem. Pharmacol 1973,22, 3099-3108.] based on the IC50 and the respective Km, determined previously (K* = IC50/ (1+S/Km)). The Km for the substrate used was determined under the conditions of the test with at least 5 substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 times Km. [Lottenberg R, Hall JA, Blinder M&gt; Binder EP, Jackson CM., The action of thrombin on peptide p-nitroanilide substrates. Substrate selectivity and examination of hydrolysis under different reaction conditions. Biochim Biophys Ada. 1983 Feb 15; 742(3):539-57]. according to Eadie [Eadie G.S. The inhibition of cholinesterase by physostigmine and prostigmine. J. Biol. Chem, 1942,146, 85-93.].<br>
The Km for S-2222 amounted to 613 fiM.<br><br>
The activity of the low molecular weight substances can, moreover be characterized in the "prothrombin time" (PT) clotting test. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent Thereafter, 0.25 ml of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) was placed in the instrument-specific sample container. In each case 5 yd of each dilution of the substance-dilution series was then mixed with the plasma provided. This plasma/inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes. Thereafter, there were pipetted to the semi-automatic device (ACL, Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Instrument Laboratory)) 50 pi of plasma/ inhibitor mixture in the measurement container. The clotting reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of Dade® Innovin® (recombinant human tissue factor combined with calcium buffer and synthetic phospholipids, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4212-50). The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the PT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can furthermore be characterised by the Activated Partial Thromboplastin time (aPTT). This coagulation test can e.g. be run on the ACL 300 Coagulation System (Instrumentation Laboratory) automatic analyzer. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent. The test is performed with the Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent (purified soy phosphatides in l.OxlO^M ellagic acid, stabilizers and preservative, Dade Behring, Inc., Cat. B4218-100) Thereafter, 0.25 ml aliquots of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) are spiked with 5 pi of test compound in at least 6 concentrations. 50 pi plasma at 4°C containing 1/50 vol. inhibitor in solvent are incubated with 50 pi Dade® Actin® FS Activated PTT reagent in water at 37°C for 3 min., then 50 pi CaCl2.2H2O 25 mM in water at 37°C are added. The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the APTT clotting time, was determined by fitting the data to an exponential regression (XLfit).<br>
The Ki values of the active compounds of the present invention preferably amount to about 0.001 to 50 pM, especially about 0.001 to 1 jiM. The PT values preferably amount to about 1 to 100 pM, especially to about 1 to 10 pM. The aPTT values preferably amount to about 1 to 100 pM, especially to about 1 to 10 pM.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally* e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid<br><br>
waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about 1 to 300 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br><br>
