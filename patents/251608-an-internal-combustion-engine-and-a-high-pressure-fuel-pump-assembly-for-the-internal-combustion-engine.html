REMOTELY MOUNTED HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]       This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/824961, filed September 8, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]       The present invention relates to a remotely mounted high-pressure fuel pump<br>
assembly for an internal combustion engine and more specifically for a high-pressure fuel<br>
pump assembly of a spark ignition direct injection engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]       Fuel pumps for vehicles are used for pumping fuel from a fuel source to a fuel<br>
delivery system of an internal combustion engine. Depending on the type of fuel delivery<br>
system; carburetor, throttle body injection, port injection, or direct injection, the fuel is<br>
delivered under low- or high-pressure. A fuel injection system typically requires fuel to<br>
be delivered at higher pressure than that of a carburetor.<br>
[0004]       Traditional Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) engines employ a high-<br>
pressure fuel pump that is driven by a camshaft used for valve train actuation of the<br>
internal combustion engine. It is beneficial to drive the pump with the engine's camshaft<br>
or camshaft drive since the pump typically needs to be synchronized with engine timing.<br>
[0005]       For certain compact engine designs including, for example, engines having<br>
pushrod valve train systems, access to the camshaft and space for packaging the pump is<br>
limited. Therefore, to mount a high-pressure fuel pump directly operated by the engine<br>
camshaft would require a significant redesign of the engine block. Thus, in these<br>
situations, a remotely mounted, accessory-driven fuel pump would provide an alternative<br>
means to meet the requirements for such applications.<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>
2<br>
[0006]       A remotely mounted, accessory-driven fuel pump may also be desirable in<br>
applications where modularity between the SIDI and multi-port fuel injection versions of<br>
the same engine is desired, or to reduce investment in engine changes to convert to SIDI.<br>
No commercially available engines, however, disclose an accessory driven high-pressure<br>
fuel pump.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]       An internal combustion engine, such as a spark-ignited direct injection engine,<br>
is provided having an accessory drive system. A high-pressure fuel pump assembly is<br>
mounted with respect to the engine and driven by the accessory drive system.<br>
Additionally, the internal combustion engine includes an engine block and at least one<br>
cylinder head mounted thereto. The engine block and at least one cylinder head delineate<br>
a plane. The high-pressure fuel pump assembly includes a high-pressure fuel pump, such<br>
as a rotary type or a piston type pump, that is mounted substantially behind the plane.<br>
The high-pressure fuel pump is driven by a drive shaft which is configured to collapse or<br>
telescope in the presence of an axial force of sufficient magnitude.<br>
[0008]       In one embodiment, the high-pressure fuel pump may be a piston type pump<br>
having a camshaft configured to operate the high-pressure fuel pump. The drive shaft<br>
may be configured to selectively telescope within the camshaft in the presence of an axial<br>
force of sufficient magnitude.<br>
[0009]       In another embodiment, the drive shaft of the high-pressure fuel pump<br>
assembly may include a tube portion and a shaft portion in engagement with the tube<br>
portion for unitary rotation therewith. The shaft portion may be configured to selectively<br>
telescope within the tube portion in the presence of an axial force of sufficient magnitude.<br>
Alternately, the drive shaft may include a plurality of pleats to allow the collapsing or<br>
bucking of the drive shaft in the presence of an axial force of sufficient magnitude.<br>
[0010]       In yet another embodiment, the drive shaft may include a pulley sufficiently<br>
configured to engage a drive belt of the accessory drive system. Furthermore, the high-<br>
pressure fuel pump assembly may include a sensor, such as a Hall Effect type sensor,<br>
operable to provide pump synchronization with the internal combustion engine.<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>

[0011]       The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best<br>
modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012]       Figure 1 is a top view of a portion of a spark ignited direct injection internal<br>
combustion engine incorporating a remotely mounted "piston type" high-pressure fuel<br>
pump assembly in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0013]       Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional illustration of the remotely mounted<br>
"piston type" high-pressure fuel pump assembly of Figure 1;<br>
[0014]       Figure 3 is a schematic cross sectional illustration of a remotely mounted<br>
"rotary type" high-pressure fuel pump assembly in accordance with the present invention;<br>
and<br>
[0015]       Figure 4 is a schematic cross sectional illustration of an alternate embodiment<br>
of the remotely mounted "rotary type" high-pressure fuel pump assembly of Figure 3.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]       Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers correspond to like<br>
or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 an<br>
internal combustion engine, generally indicated at 10. The internal combustion engine is<br>
preferably a Spark Ignition Direct Injection, or SIDI, engine the operation of which is<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The internal combustion engine 10 is shown as a V-<br>
type engine having cylinder bores, not shown, arranged in a V-shaped fashion. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the invention described hereinbelow may be applied<br>
to other engine types such as inline, horizontally opposed, W-type, etc.<br>
[0017]       The internal combustion engine 10 includes an engine block 12 having a first<br>
cylinder head 14 and a second cylinder head 16 mounted thereto. An accessory drive<br>
system 18 is mounted with respect to the internal combustion engine 10 ahead of a plane,<br>
indicated by broken line P (the plane being perpendicular to the page), which is<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>
4<br>
delineated by the engine block 12 and the first and second cylinder heads 14 and 16,<br>
respectively. Therefore, the engine block 12 and the first and second cylinder heads 14<br>
and 16 are disposed generally behind plane P, while the accessory drive system 18 is<br>
disposed substantially in front of plane P. The orientation of the plane P within the<br>
vehicle, not shown, will vary depending on the orientation of the internal combustion<br>
engine 10. For a longitudinal orientation of the internal combustion engine 10, the plane<br>
P will face toward the front of the vehicle. Alternately, for a transverse orientation of the<br>
internal combustion engine 10, the plane P will face toward either the driver's side or<br>
passenger's side of the vehicle.<br>
[0018]       The accessory drive system 18 includes an alternator 20, water pump 22, and<br>
a high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 all of which are driven by a serpentine drive belt<br>
25. The serpentine drive belt 25 transmits torque from the crankshaft, not shown, of the<br>
internal combustion engine 10 to the alternator 20, water pump 22, and high-pressure fuel<br>
pump assembly 24. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the accessory drive<br>
system 18 may include additional components, such as a power steering pump, air<br>
conditioning compressor, etc. while remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
Since the high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 is not driven directly by the engine's<br>
camshaft, not shown, or cam drive, not shown, as in conventional fuel pump drives, the<br>
high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 can be characterized as remotely mounted.<br>
[0019]       The high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 includes a high-pressure fuel pump<br>
26 mounted with respect to a pump camshaft housing 28. The high-pressure fuel pump<br>
assembly 24 further includes a pulley 30 operable to transfer driving torque from the<br>
serpentine drive belt 25 to a drive shaft 32, shown as a broken line. The drive shaft 32 is<br>
configured to drive the high-pressure fuel pump 26 in a manner to be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Figure 2.<br>
[0020]       A bearing support bracket 34 and the pump camshaft housing 28 cooperate to<br>
mount the high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 with respect to the internal combustion<br>
engine 10. The high-pressure fuel pump 26 is preferably mounted behind the plane P,<br>
thereby reducing the likelihood of damage caused to the high-pressure fuel pump 26 in<br>
the event of a vehicle accident or impact. A high-pressure oil feed 36 may be provided<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>
5<br>
should the high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 require an external lubrication source.<br>
The oil may drain from the high pressure fuel pump 26 to an area beneath a rocker cover<br>
40. Alternately, an oil return passage 38 may be provided in a rocker cover 40 to enable<br>
drain back of lubricant from the high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24.<br>
[0021]       Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a cross sectional view of the high-<br>
pressure fuel pump assembly 24. The pulley 30 is mounted to a flanged shaft 42 via a<br>
plurality of fasteners 44. The flanged shaft 42 is rotatably supported within the bearing<br>
support bracket 34 by a bearing 46. The bearing 46 may be a type known in the art such<br>
as a roller bearing, ball bearing, journal bearing, etc. The flanged shaft 42 includes an<br>
end portion 48 sufficiently configured to engage a coupling member 50 for unitary<br>
rotation therewith. The end portion 48 may engage the coupling member 50 through an<br>
interference fit, threaded engagement, or any other engagement mechanism known in the<br>
art to substantially limit the axial movement between the flanged shaft 42 and the<br>
coupling member 50, while allowing the transfer of torque therebetween.<br>
[0022]       The coupling member 50 is sufficiently configured to engage the drive shaft<br>
32 for unitary rotation therewith. The coupling member 50 preferably engages a first end<br>
52 of the drive shaft 32 via a splined engagement, hex engagement or any other<br>
engagement mechanism known in the art to allow the axial movement between the<br>
coupling member 50 and the drive shaft 32, while allowing the transfer of torque<br>
therebetween. A second end 54 of the drive shaft 32 is sufficiently configured to engage<br>
a camshaft 56 for unitary rotation therewith. The second end 54 of the drive shaft 32<br>
preferably engages the camshaft 56 via a splined engagement, hex engagement or any<br>
other engagement mechanism known in the art to allow the axial movement between the<br>
drive shaft 32 and the camshaft 56, while allowing the transfer of torque therebetween.<br>
The camshaft 56 is rotatably supported within the pump camshaft housing 28 and<br>
includes an eccentric cam 58 operable to selectively bias a piston 60 to effect operation of<br>
the high-pressure fuel pump 26 with the rotation of the camshaft 56.<br>
[0023]       A seal support 62 is mounted to the pump camshaft housing 28 and is<br>
configured to retain a seal member 64 in relation to the camshaft 56 to reduce the<br>
likelihood external leakage of lubricant from within the pump camshaft housing 28.<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>
6<br>
Additionally, the seal member 64 may prevent the intrusion of foreign matter into the<br>
pump camshaft housing 28, thereby increasing the reliability of the high-pressure fuel<br>
pump assembly 24. A sleeve 66 extends between the seal support 62 and the bearing<br>
support bracket 34 and is sealed by seal members 68 and 70, respectively. The sleeve 66<br>
is operable to prevent infiltration of foreign matter, such as dirt, water, grease, etc. within<br>
the high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24.<br>
[0024]       A target wheel 72 is mounted with respect to the camshaft 56, while a sensor<br>
74 is mounted with respect to the pump camshaft housing 28. The sensor 74 and the<br>
target wheel 72 cooperate to provide camshaft position information for pump<br>
synchronization purposes. The sensor may be any type known in the art, such as a Hall<br>
Effect sensor, while remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0025]       The camshaft 56 is preferably formed with a hollow center having an internal<br>
diameter of Dl, while the drive shaft 32 is formed having an external diameter of D2.<br>
Preferably, the diameter Dl is greater than the diameter D2. A shaft retainer 76 is<br>
provided within the camshaft 56 and operates to maintain the relative axial position<br>
between the drive shaft 32 and the camshaft 56. Should an axial force of sufficient<br>
magnitude be applied to the pulley 30 and the flanged shaft 42, such as in a vehicle<br>
impact situation, the driveshaft 32 will cause the shaft retainer 76 to shear thereby<br>
allowing the translation of the drive shaft 32 within the camshaft 56. This relative<br>
translational or axial movement between the drive shaft 32 and the camshaft 56 allows a<br>
predetermined amount of deflection to occur within the high-pressure fuel pump<br>
assembly 24 while allowing the high-pressure fuel pump 26 to remain substantially<br>
undamaged. The sleeve 66 includes a plurality of pleats 78, which allow the sleeve 66 to<br>
collapse or buckle as the drive shaft 32 telescopes within the camshaft 56.<br>
[0026]       Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the<br>
high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24 of Figures 1 and 2, generally indicated at 24A. The<br>
high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24A includes a high-pressure fuel pump 26A driven<br>
by the pulley 30 through a drive shaft 32A. The high-pressure fuel pump 26A is<br>
preferably a "rotary type" pump. The drive shaft 32A includes a shaft portion 80<br>
disposed at least partially within a tube portion 82. The shaft portion 80 preferably<br><br>
GP-309203-PTE-JK<br>
7<br>
engages the tube portion 82 via a splined engagement, hex engagement or any other<br>
engagement mechanism known in the art to allow axial movement between the shaft<br>
portion 80 and the tube portion 82, while allowing the transfer of torque therebetween. A<br>
shaft retainer 84 is provided within the tube portion 82 and operates to limit the axial<br>
movement of the shaft portion 80 within the tube portion 82. Should an axial force of<br>
sufficient magnitude be applied to the pulley 30, such as in a vehicle impact situation, the<br>
shaft portion 80 will cause the shaft retainer 84 to shear thereby allowing the translation<br>
of the shaft portion 80 within the tube portion 82. This relative translational or axial<br>
movement between the shaft portion 80 and the tube portion 82 allows a predetermined<br>
amount of deflection to occur within the drive shaft 32A while allowing the high-pressure<br>
fuel pump 26A to remain substantially undamaged.<br>
[0027]       Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the<br>
high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24A of Figure 3, generally indicated at 24B. The<br>
high-pressure fuel pump assembly 24B includes a high-pressure fuel pump 26A driven by<br>
the pulley 30 through a drive shaft 32B. As in Figure 3, the high-pressure fuel pump 26A<br>
is preferably a "rotary type" pump. The drive shaft 32B is generally tubular in shape and<br>
includes a plurality of pleats 86. The tube is preferably designed to allow the effective<br>
transfer of torque between the pulley 30 and the high-pressure fuel pump 26A. Should an<br>
axial force of sufficient magnitude be applied to the pulley 30, such as in a vehicle impact<br>
situation, the pleats 86 will allow the drive shaft 32B to collapse or buckle, thereby<br>
allowing a predetermined amount of deflection to occur within the drive shaft 32B while<br>
allowing the high-pressure fuel pump 26A to remain substantially undamaged.<br>
[0028]       The telescoping nature of the drive shafts 32 and 32A and the bucking nature<br>
of the drive shaft 32B in conjunction with the positioning of the high-pressure fuel pumps<br>
26 and 26A behind the plane P (i.e. toward the top of the drawing as viewed in Figure 1),<br>
shown in Figure 1, and delineated by the edge of the cylinder heads 14 and 16 and the<br>
engine block 12, is effective in isolating the high-pressure fuel pumps 26 and 26A from<br>
certain types of impact loads.<br>
[0029]       While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br><br>
