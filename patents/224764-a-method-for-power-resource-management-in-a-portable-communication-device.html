				<td>A METHOD FOR POWER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<br>
IN A PORTABLE COMMUNICATION DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for power resource management in a<br>
portable communication device, i.e. the present invention generally relates to reducing<br>
power consumption in a communication device. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to power management in a portable radiotelephone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many communication devices operate on battery power. The radiotelephones in<br>
use today are almost all portable devices utilizing batteries that need periodic<br>
recharging. The size of the battery and the power efficiency of the communication device<br>
determine the amount of talk time available to a user. As a convenience to a user, it has<br>
always been desirable to extend the life of the battery to provide longer talk times.<br>
However, even with the present devices, communications are occasionally interrupted,<br>
requiring the recharging of the battery or replacement with a freshly recharged battery.<br>
Moreover, new phone features and standards are dramatically elevating phone<br>
functions, which increase processing power requirements. Such new features and<br>
functions include Internet browser capability, wireless multimedia, smart phones and<br>
videophones, for example. These requirements also increase processing speed, which is<br>
known to increase current drain. High speed packet data, data and image processing,<br>
General Packet Radio Service, Global Positioning System service, local connectivity<br>
services to a computer or peripherals, multimedia cards, and multiple high processing<br>
functions all require an increased level of processor operational speed, hardware<br>
accelerators, more complicated hardware and software, larger and more complicated<br>
instruction sets. Further, the phone may be called upon to power additional phone<br>
modules that plug into the phone.<br>
As a result, the operational frequency of the phone processor has increased and<br>
the number of transistors on the phone IC sets has increased to support these new<br>
functions and interfaces. Modern silicon technology has been improving, but has not<br>
kept pace with the functional revolution in phone technology. Consequently, the power<br>
demands on a phone has been constantly increasing. Therefore, it has been desirable to<br>
further extend the battery life on a communication device.<br>
At the same time, there are limiting factors in the phone themselves. New phones<br>
must be as small or smaller than the phones they are replacing. Therefore, batteries<br>
must be smaller. In addition, the amount of power dissipation is limited by the smaller<br>
package, existing silicon technology, and the temperature limits of components in the<br>
phone. Further, the battery technology is not able to provide the necessary current for a<br>
sufficient time in some of the desirable or simultaneous user modes. For example, a<br>
wireless packet data connection in GPRS for an Internet browser, or local connectivity to<br>
a computer and multimedia functions, would have a high current drain on a battery.<br>
There are several existing power management techniques to reduce power<br>
consumption of phone circuits and processors. These techniques include (US patent<br>
class 713/320) lowering voltage, frequency modulation, lowering frequency, gating<br>
clocks and/or transmitter/receiver, shutdown components in the phone that are not being<br>
used at the time (standby/sleep mode), etc. However, these techniques are reactive in<br>
that they will still provide full operability of the phone even though the battery may not be<br>
able to supply sufficient power for all functions.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a method and apparatus for predictive current<br>
reduction and extension of a battery lifetime in a communication device such as a<br>
radiotelephone. There is a further need to provide user input and options as to the<br>
operability of particular functions of the phone. It would also be of benefit to provide<br>
these advantages without additional hardware, which would increase the cost of the<br>
communication device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The features of the present invention, which are believed to be novel, are set forth<br>
with particularity in the appended claims. The invention, together with further objects and<br>
advantages thereof, may best be understood by making reference to the following<br>
description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in the several figures<br>
of which like reference numerals identify identical elements, wherein:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention reduces the current drain in a communication device by<br>
predicting the current drain for a particular application in a communication device<br>
before entering and running such. In addition, where there is a potential to exceed<br>
battery capacity, the present invention provides for user input to direct the<br>
functionality of the phone instead of the phone dropping applications on its own,<br>
which is undesirable.. It also reduces the total current drain and extends the battery<br>
life of a device by limiting the amount of information processed, transmitted and<br>
received by the device, and in particular, by wireless connectivity, which usually takes<br>
the most power consumption. This is accomplished in a phone without additional<br>
hardware, which would increase the cost of the communication device.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention predicts power consumption based on<br>
power or current profiles for every operational mode for optimizing user utilization of<br>
a communication device, such as a radiotelephone.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a radiotelephone system 100 includes a<br>
radiotelephone 102 with components powered by a battery 110. Preferably, the<br>
battery is rechargeable. The radiotelephone 102 is configured to provide a<br>
communication connect to a base station 104. This connection can be in any standard<br>
communication system and can be to a wide area network access, for example. The<br>
radiotelephone 102 can also be configured to accommodate local connectivity, such as<br>
to local area network (LAN) 106. This connection can be wired or wireless.<br>
Optionally, local connectivity can be provided to the LAN 106 through a module 108<br>
made for that purpose. This connection can also be wired or wireless. The module<br>
108 may contain its own power source, or it can be coupled to the radiotelephone 102<br>
to draw power directly from the battery 110.<br>
The radiotelephone 102 includes transceiver 112 coupled to one or more<br>
antennas 114. The radiotelephone is controlled by a processor 116 that is generally<br>
coupled to all the components of the radiotelephone 102. The processor 116 can be a<br>
microprocessor, microcontroller, DSP, combination of both, or other similar control<br>
circuit. The processor 116 obtains its instructions from a memory 118. The memory<br>
can be a static, dynamic, flash or erasable memory of a ROM or RAM configuration.<br>
Along with the standard uses for memory, the memory 118 can also contain many<br>
different applications to provide various functions of the radiotelephone. Optionally,<br>
the processor can also down load application from the base station 104 and/or LAN<br>
106, that can be stored in memory 118. A user interface 120 is coupled to the<br>
processor to provide and receive user information. The user interface typically<br>
includes a display, a keypad, a microphone and an earpiece with speaker. It should be<br>
recognized that there are many other devices necessary in the operation of the<br>
radiotelephone that are not shown, to avoid confusion.<br>
The antenna 114 receives signals from the base station 104 or from local<br>
connection 106 in the vicinity. Received signals are converted to electrical signals by<br>
the antenna 114 and provided to the transceiver 112 to provide conversion to baseband<br>
or data signals. The transceiver 112 includes an amplifier and other circuitry, such as<br>
RF circuits and demodulation circuitry, as is known in the art. The baseband or data<br>
signals are provided to the other circuits (not shown) in the radiotelephone 104, which<br>
converts them to streams of digital data for further processing. Similarly, the<br>
radiotelephone 102 provides data or baseband signals through modulation circuitry<br>
(not shown) in the transceiver 112, which sends electrical signals to the antenna 114<br>
for transmission to the base station 102 or LAN 106. Typically, a transmitter power<br>
amplifier consumes the most power in the radiotelephone 102.<br>
The processor 116 controls the functions of the radiotelephone 102. The<br>
processor 116 operates in response to stored programs of instructions, and can load<br>
such stored programs as needed to provide a particular function of the radiotelephone<br>
102. The present invention defines a method to reduce the current drain in the<br>
receiver by predicting the current drain for a particular application in a communication<br>
device before entering and running such application. It also reduces the total current<br>
drain and extends the battery life of a device by dynamically limiting the amount of<br>
information processed, transmitted and received by the device. In addition, user input<br>
is solicited to direct the functionality of the phone instead of the phone dropping or<br>
restricting applications on its own as power is exhausted, which is undesirable. In<br>
contrast, prior art techniques address power problems as they occur and do not<br>
consider the power consequences before a function is started.<br>
In its simplest form, the present invention provides either full application<br>
operability, alternative operation in low power mode, or restricted operability, as<br>
described above. This can include alternative, low power operations, restriction of<br>
some high current modes, and utilization of function usage profiles and predicting<br>
current drain in any phone operations prior to entering a desired operation.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides three main power modes: maximum<br>
performance, power saving mode, and low battery mode. In the maximum<br>
performance mode, the processor allows the phone to activate any functional modes<br>
and their combinations. These modes and their operational parameters can be pre-<br>
defined by a user, if desired. The limiting factors are only maximum current draw or<br>
excessive temperature resulting from a particular mode combination. For example, in<br>
some modes, current drain will exceed the current limit and the phone protection<br>
circuits shut down the phone. This can occur when connecting some accessories to<br>
the phone, which have power supplied by the phone, and activation some high power<br>
consumption modes simultaneously. Based on power profiles and system<br>
configuration, the processor can predict the phone total current drain before actual<br>
entering into this mode and provide advice to the user through the user interface (on<br>
the display screen for example) to change mode or operating configuration without<br>
shutting down the communication device. In some other modes, or particular mode<br>
combination, the internal phone temperature can exceed the temperature limit, and the<br>
phone would be shut down by temperature protection circuitry. Based on power<br>
profiles and system configuration, the processor can predict the phone total current<br>
drain before actual entering into this mode and provide advice to the user (on the<br>
screen) to change mode or system configuration without shutting down the device.<br>
In the power saving mode, the present invention can use various novel<br>
techniques to reduce current drain on the battery. As is well known, power<br>
consumption can depend upon the amount of information processing by the phone.<br>
This includes transmitting/receiving information and using algorithms, which are<br>
required to process this information. Information and algorithms are both represented<br>
by the amount of bits in a digital bitstream in the phone. The more bits there are, the<br>
more active time of the phone components and digital gate switching activity are<br>
required, and the more power is needed to support this activity. The power saving<br>
mode reduces the amount of information to lower current drain.<br>
The main techniques of the power saving mode are: a) to limit the amount of<br>
information processed, transmitted and received by the phone, especially by wireless<br>
connectivity, which usually takes the most power consumption, b) to use transmission<br>
protocols requiring lower amounts of information, c) to use some modes of the phone<br>
features and functions that do not use complicated algorithms to process the data, d) to<br>
use a simpler presentation of information that does not requires large amount of bits<br>
(text or graphics), e) to change to a connectivity interface requiring lower power<br>
consumption, and f) to restrict (terminate) some services (functions) requiring higher<br>
levels of power consumption and not being of a high priority for the user at some<br>
particular time (e.g. paging, WAP, and GPS that a user can set up).<br>
The main advantage in power saving mode is to provide solutions that provide<br>
a compromise between the phone performance and quality, the amount of processing<br>
information, and the ability to get the required information during all active phone<br>
time without terminating the service to recharge the battery. The user might not to<br>
have opportunity to directly intervene to do this in some conditions. Therefore, the<br>
processor can enter power saving mode autonomously. Optionally, the user can setup<br>
predefined preferences of power saving modes, i.e. prioritize which power saving<br>
techniques to use. Additionally, the processor can be setup by the user to notify the<br>
user, through the user interface, in real time to select a power saving technique as<br>
needed.<br>
Most of a phone's power consumption is drawn by circuits in active modes,<br>
such as the radio transceiver that transfers data in and out of the phone (a transmission<br>
required power amplifier uses the most power), and the processor that process the<br>
required information. Some of this is under control of the communication system, and<br>
not controlled by the device itself. In addition, most data are encoded in a fairly<br>
complicated way, in multiple layers, which requires a high level of processing by the<br>
device main processors and DSPs, which transfer data between internal multiple<br>
modules with high speed.<br>
The present invention is able to lower the amount of information transferred in<br>
the power saving mode. For example, multimedia video standard MPEG-4 assumes<br>
four profile levels: level 1 - 176x144 QCIF with bit rate 64 kbps; level 2 - 352x288<br>
QCIF with 128 kbps, Ievel3 - CIF with 384 kbps; level 4 - CIF with 2Mbps. By<br>
selecting a lower profile level, the user will receive a smaller picture size, loaded at a<br>
lower speed. As a result, the user receives picture with less quality, than he can get at<br>
the maximum profile level, but the user would be able to receive more required<br>
pictures with the same battery capacity or to save power for other functions. The same<br>
might be applied to the use of an Internet browser through wireless application<br>
protocol (WAP), selecting a lower amount of a data transmission (for instance, only<br>
text information with limited graphic and audio information, etc.).<br>
Further, the present invention allows the changing of the protocol for receiving<br>
data, e.g. canceling an Internet browser via WAP and using only Short Message<br>
Service (SMS), which provides usually minimum text information about the latest<br>
news. Along these lines, the processor can change the data transmission from a<br>
wireless connectivity (from a LAN such as Bluetooth™, for instance, which requires<br>
significantly more power) to lower powered USB or RS232 interfaces. Additionally,<br>
the processor can restrict or terminate some services (functions) that require a higher<br>
level of power consumption and have been identified as a lower priority for the user in<br>
some particular time. These services can include an Internet browser, GPS, "blue<br>
tooth" connectivity, etc. Further, the processor can have multiple power saving<br>
modes, which depend on extended functions of the phone and its configuration.<br>
In the low battery mode, the processor identifies conditions where available<br>
power (i.e. the battery capacity) would not be sufficient to provide some functional<br>
mode that requires significant power consumption and would discharge the battery or<br>
exceed battery capacity. The processor can enter into this mode automatically, based<br>
on power profiles and battery capacity, or through user intervention, as previously<br>
described. Specifically, the processor can restrict entry into a functional mode that<br>
would shut down immediately the phone as result of completely discharging the<br>
battery due to significant continuous power consumption. This restricted entry occurs<br>
before entering into the functional mode, thereby preventing the loss of internal<br>
information in memory (SRAM, SDRAM) under power from the battery. For<br>
example, the wireless (cellular) connectivity required to transmit data or to make<br>
regular phone calls requires a significant amount of energy. If this function cannot be<br>
supplied from the battery in low battery mode, the processor will notify the user about<br>
the low battery condition and restrict entry pending further user instruction.<br>
Advantageously, the user can still be allowed access to internal phone information,<br>
such as notebook, address book, which can be displayed without significant power<br>
consumption.<br>
In operation, the communication device has predefined power mode<br>
parameters, which are correlated by: available power or existing battery capacity, the<br>
provided functions and the typical power or current profile for each provided function,<br>
and existing wireless communication conditions. Obviously, battery capacity must be<br>
known to manage power in the device. In addition, the current profile of a function<br>
should be known and measured against battery capacity. Moreover, the<br>
communication system dictates how much transmitter power is used, depending on the<br>
air interface conditions, which directly impact current usage. These parameters must<br>
be balanced against the chosen phone configuration and the user priorities.<br>
The user can predefine options to address the management of power modes.<br>
For example, the user can set up the options for: a) the priority of the available phone<br>
functions, b) the list of functions to be restricted in the power saving or low battery<br>
modes, c) the user interface technique used by the device to inform the user, the time<br>
interval and/or battery capacity that switches the device in to or out of power saving<br>
mode or exit from the one, and e) selecting from a list of proposed battery saving<br>
modes parameters from the device, among others.<br>
Preferably, the system (processor) will provide recommendations (advise) to<br>
the user about the optimum way to use functional modes or their combinations, based<br>
on the functional conditions of the device and the user setup options. For instance, the<br>
processor, through the user interface, can recommend not using a radio<br>
communication mode to save battery capacity to keep the user (phone) internal data<br>
saved until recharging. However, the user can make a few calls in the case of emer-<br>
gency or high priority, and System will estimate and give to user the active time, based<br>
on battery capacity. In another example, the device can notify the user about power<br>
condition changes, using the phone display, speaker or alarm signal. In all cases, the<br>
user is able to receive from the device battery capacity value and the average active<br>
time range for every functional mode.<br>
The present invention is advice based. Although, the invention can include<br>
some actions that are taken autonomously, with or without predefined user<br>
preferences, priorities or instructions. The device provides its own recommendations<br>
to the user on how to optimize battery life time, given an existing battery capacity,<br>
user priority, existing environmental conditions, and desired functional modes. The<br>
present invention is interactive. A user can set up options for particular power modes<br>
(the function priority, the list of functions that have to be restricted in power saving or<br>
low battery modes) or select battery saving mode parameters proposed by the device.<br>
It should be recognized that the device can provide automatic power cuts for some<br>
modes or their combinations, such as due to existing battery capacity, ambient and<br>
phone internal temperature, and the phone system configuration.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a method for power resource management in a portable<br>
communication device, in accordance with the present invention. A first step 200<br>
includes defining typical power and usage profiles of a plurality of operational modes<br>
of the communication device. Power profiles typically include current required over<br>
time. Usage can also be defined in terms of power or instantaneous current usage, for<br>
example. Usage can be assumed by predefined, typical current profile that can be<br>
expected in the operation of a particular function, or can be monitored in real-time. Of<br>
particular importance is the expected maximum current draw that can be expected<br>
during the function of the operational mode. It is also important to note the timing of<br>
the current usage or power profile, for if two operational modes have a combined<br>
maximum current that is more than the battery capacity, but these maximums come at<br>
different times, it may still be safe to operate the device in maximum performance<br>
mode. In addition, batteries can provide current bursts over short periods that can<br>
exceed the average available current.<br>
A next step 202 includes calculating available power in the communication<br>
device. Typically, this is the battery capacity of the communication device.<br>
Obviously, this must be known or monitored, as it is the resource to be managed.<br>
Optionally, the device should be able to recognize when there is an external power<br>
source (e.g. it is in a charging cradle), wherein the device can bypass its power saving<br>
or low battery modes.<br>
A next step 204 includes inputting operating parameters of a selected<br>
operational mode. This operating parameters can include, priorities of the operational<br>
mode, settings for preferred user interface of data such as how power management<br>
information is displayed, level of user interaction with the operating parameters,<br>
prioritized data rates, desired transmission protocol, required quality levels, desired<br>
connectivity interface, how the device should handle low-power conditions, data<br>
rates, etc. Also, parameters should include time intervals (durations) of required<br>
operations in different modes, which might be set up by user requirements or by<br>
system based on typical usage profiles and required total time of a phone operation._<br>
The operating parameters of any selected mode can be predefined by a user of the<br>
communication device, or can be selected automatically or by the user before entry<br>
into a selected operational mode. The user can be warned of the low-power<br>
condition, and can be provided with instructional advice as to possible techniques to<br>
for changing the operating parameters of one or more of the operating mode to<br>
alleviate power consumption. Optionally, the device can save internal data of the<br>
communication device to a static random access memory, if power-loss is imminent.<br>
A next step 206 includes predicting whether there is sufficient available power<br>
capacity to operate the selected operational mode before entry into the selected<br>
operational mode. Based on step 204, the system updates power profiles for the<br>
particular user requirements. Based on power profiles, which defines power (current<br>
drain), and the times of operation in every required modes (from 204) the system are<br>
able to calculate required battery capacity (energy) for the required operations<br>
(multiply power in particular operational mode and time interval for this mode).<br>
If there is sufficient power (207), then entering (209) the selected mode is<br>
permitted. However, if there is insufficient available power (207), the steps (208) are<br>
taken for restricting operation of at least one of the operational modes of the<br>
communication device before entry into the selected operational mode. In this case,<br>
the selected mode can be restricted, or other presently operating modes can be<br>
restricted to provide sufficient power levels for each.<br>
The restricting step 208 can include totally preventing entry into the selected<br>
operational mode, or it can providing a user of the communication device the option<br>
of changing the operating parameters of the selected operational mode to allow entry<br>
therein. This can include a list of parameters on a display or it can be a prompt that<br>
advises a user what options can be taken to lower power consumption. Alternatively,<br>
the restricting step 208 can include automatically changing the operation of the<br>
selected operational mode or other operational modes according to the associated<br>
operating parameters of that mode to allow entry into the selected operational mode.<br>
Preferably, the restricting step 208 can include dynamically limiting information<br>
processing, data receiving and data transmitting. For example, restricting can include<br>
automatically changing information transfer protocols to achieve lower data rates,<br>
which in turn lowers current drain. Where the operating parameters include priority<br>
of operational modes, the restricting step 208 can include eliminating lower priority<br>
operational modes.<br>
A preferred technique to restrict operation of a mode is to limit informational<br>
flow or data rate. Specifically, this can include: limiting the amount of information<br>
processed, using an transmission protocol requiring less information, reducing<br>
information display, changing to a connectivity interface with lower current<br>
consumption, prioritizing processor functions, lowering the quality of transmitted<br>
information, changing information protocols, and using operating modes with less<br>
processor computations.<br>
The predicting step 206 can include calculating the existing power load or<br>
current drain of the communication device including all presently operating modes,<br>
and comparing the combination of the existing power load and the usage profile of the<br>
selected operational mode to the available power (i.e. battery capacity). The power<br>
profiles include power values for every operational mode, including any combination<br>
of simultaneous performance. Preferably, the power profiles of all the existing<br>
operational modes and processor functions and the desired operational mode are<br>
combined into a total operating profile and compared to the available battery capacity.<br>
In the power saving mode embodiment of the present invention, the operating<br>
parameters of the inputting step 204 include a time period and a required minimum<br>
power capacity for operation of the selected operational mode. In this case, the<br>
predicting step 206 includes predicting whether there is sufficient power to operate the<br>
selected operational mode at the minimum power capacity during the defined time<br>
period. If it is discovered that there is insufficient power, this embodiment restricts<br>
208 operation of operational modes that are presently operating (i.e. earlier than the<br>
define time period) to provide the required minimum power capacity for operation of<br>
the selected operational mode during the time period.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the available capacity in the communication device<br>
is monitored on a periodic or constant basis. Also, the power load is dynamically<br>
measured during operation, and the power profile along with the required capacity<br>
requirements, are updated. If at any time the current capacity of the device will be<br>
exceeded, then operation of the device can be restricted, as previously described,<br>
before available power is exceeded.<br>
The selective restriction of operation in some modes can be utilized to provide<br>
emergency calling, for example. For example, if a battery is close its end of charge,<br>
the system can save reserved battery capacity for the some emergency calls, restricting<br>
all other operations, which cause a discharge of the battery. Also, if the battery is near<br>
the end of its life, and any wireless connectivities will cause of significant dropping of<br>
the voltage and immediate shut down of the phone with losing information, the<br>
selective restricting mode will allow a user to watch and save the phone information<br>
before a shut down.<br>
FIG. 3 demonstrates a detailed flow of a specific first embodiment of the<br>
present invention based on minimizing of processing information and battery capacity.<br>
The system enters in this mode automatically upon the approach 306 of a particular<br>
level of the battery capacity. The level is defined 300 as a percentage of a battery total<br>
capacity, which can be recommended by the system or set up by user 302, and which<br>
is monitored 304 by the system. This percentage defines the level of battery capacitor,<br>
and when it becomes insufficient for full operation.<br>
During a particular operation, the system determines 308 (i.e. measures or<br>
estimates) the power load, compares to the typical power profiles for this mode. (New<br>
operational modes can be requested 312 or supplied from a local area network.) In<br>
defining a typical low power load 310, for every kind of operational mode of the<br>
system, besides the power profile (which can be updated automatically based on the<br>
real measurements in this mode and statistics), the system keeps in memory the power<br>
of alternative solutions, which provide the same functionality but with lower power<br>
(e.g. parameters, protocol different, with less quality or performance...), or alternative<br>
functionality (e.g. USB versus Blue Tooth connection).<br>
If the operational load exceeds the typical low power load 314, the system<br>
looks for 316 what kind of alternative solutions are available or have been used for the<br>
selected operational mode. If such solution is available 318 (i.e. the system has a<br>
possibility to use another data protocol or format to reduce power), then the system<br>
can request 320 the API (software application interface) to change to this lower power<br>
mode. The user can be notified 322 of this change. However, if a solution is not<br>
available 318, the system can either provide 326 some recommendation or advise to<br>
user to change of the operational mode based on above described low power methods<br>
and techniques (e.g. change wireless BlueTooth™ connectivity to wire USB, for<br>
example), or can notify 324 the user of restricted operation, as described previously.<br>
FIG. 4 demonstrates a detailed flow of the power-saving mode of the present<br>
invention. This mode is based on a predicting of consumption due to utilization of<br>
power profiles. It determines the required battery capacity to implement pre-defined<br>
reserved operations. In this embodiment, the user enters some operating information<br>
to the system. This information can include some reserved or mandatory operations,<br>
such as the number of desired incoming or outgoing calls or data transmissions of<br>
some particular durations of time. In addition, if the user expects some calls and wants<br>
to be in a standby mode, the user can define the time period for standby mode (or all<br>
the time), plus a small additional amount of capacity for system tolerances due to<br>
wireless conditions. These are initial conditions for the power resource monitoring.<br>
As a first step, the system determines 400 available power. The user defines<br>
402 a set of reserved operational modes with a desired time of operation for each. The<br>
system then calculates 404 the required total battery capacity, based on initial<br>
conditions and power profiles for the operational modes. Preferably, the system<br>
actually measures 406 battery capacity. If the operational modes do not exceed<br>
capacity 408, the user setup is complete 410. Otherwise, the user must reconfigure the<br>
settings 402.<br>
At this point, the device can enter power-saving mode 412. During this time,<br>
the system monitors battery capacity 414 and measures or estimates operational load<br>
416. Preferably, the power profiles are updated 418 with this information.<br>
Advantageously, the system is adaptive, using dynamic updating of power profiles<br>
based on the latest measurements and statistical data from previous operations. Using<br>
the battery and load measurements and updated profiles, the system can then<br>
recalculate 420 the required reserve capacity, increasing the veracity of power load<br>
predictions. Upon approaching 422 of the target lifetime of the available power, the<br>
system notifies 424 the user, and restricts any additional operations 426, besides the<br>
selected reserved operation without additional permission of the user.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the present invention provides a method<br>
and apparatus for reducing the current drain in a communication device using<br>
predictive techniques. Advantageously, the present invention predicts power<br>
consumption based on power profiles for operational modes for optimizing user<br>
utilization of a communication device. It also reduces the total current drain and<br>
extends the battery life of a device by limiting the amount of information processed,<br>
transmitted and received by the device.<br>
While a particular embodiment of the present invention has been shown and<br>
described, modifications may be made. It is therefore intended in the appended claims<br>
to cover all such changes and modifications which fall within the broad scope of the<br>
