SUPPORT STRUCTURE<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
THIS invention relates to a support structure. In particular the invention is concerned with a support structure for use in a telecommunications shelter.<br>
Telecommunications shelters are used for housing telecommunications and electronics equipment at telecommunications masts. Due to the fact that telecommunications equipment are sensitive to high temperatures it is preferable that a telecommunications shelter not be secured to a concrete slab as it has been found that such a configuration could lead to heat being conducted into the shelter consequently causing* temperature levels inside the shelter to reach unfavourable magnitudes.<br>
To date telecommunications shelters have been installed on support<br>
structures comprising either I-beams or sheet metal beams which are<br>
typically welded together. These support structures further include<br>
adjustable pillars for providing a level base on which a shelter portion can<br>
be secured on uneven ground surfaces.	'     â€¢<br>
A number of problems have however been identified with existing telecommunications shelters and the installation thereof. These include the high material costs associated with existing support structures which are constructed from either I-beams or sheet metal beams. If is also a labour intensive and time-consuming undertaking to construct the support structures of known telecommunications shelters. Further more the large dimensions of existing support structure components, when packed for transport, necessitate large expenditure in terms of transport costs when these components are to be transported to a site for installation.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to address the above problems which are commonly associated with existing telecommunications shelters.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure A shows a portion of a lattice beam, generally indicated with the reference numeral 1.   The lattice beam 1 comprises a number of support<br><br>
members 2 which are connected to each other by way of latticework, generally indicated with the reference numeral 3.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show a telecommunications shelter 10 employing a support structure according to the invention, generally indicated with the reference numeral 12. The telecommunications shelter 10 includes a shelter portion, shown in broken lines and indicated with the reference numeral 14, which houses telecommunications and electronics equipment. Due to the heat sensitivity of the equipment housed in the shelter portion 14, the telecommunications shelter 10 will typically include an air-conditioning unit, not shown in the drawings.<br>
Figure 5 shows the support structure 12 of the telecommunications shelter 10 with the shelter portion 14 removed. The support structure 12 is formed by a number of lattice beams which are configured as shown. The lattice beams indicated with the reference numerals 16.1, 16.2 and 16.3, having similar dimensions, lie in a flat plane, parallel to one another. The lattice beams indicated with the reference numerals 16.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5 have like dimensions and also lie parallel to each other in a flat plane. It is however pointed out that although the proportions of the lattice beams 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5 are similar to those of the lattice beams 16.1, 16.2 and 16.3, they are smaller in dimension. As shown the lattice beams 16.1, 16.2 and 16.3 lie transverse to the lattice beams 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5. It will be appreciated that the number of lattice beams used in constructing the support structure 12 could vary greatly depending on the size of the support structure which is constructed and the load which it should be capable of supporting.<br>
The support structure 12 is carried by four pillars 20.1, 20.2, 20.3 and 20.4 which are located at the corners of the support structure 12. The height of the pillars is adjustable. Adjustment of the pillars ensures that the support structure 12 can be erected on an uneven ground surface and still provide a flat and level base on which to secure the shelter portion 14. Although not shown in any of the drawings, it is envisaged that further pillars could<br><br>
be provided along the lattice beams in cases where very heavy loads are to be supported.<br>
As mentioned the latticework of the lattice beams 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4 and 18.5 are smaller in dimension than those of the lattice beams 16.1, 16.2 and 16.3. This allows the lattice beams to interconnect at interconnections indicated with reference numerals 22.1, 22.2, 22.3,...t22.n. At the interconnections 22.1, 22.2, 22.3,...,22.n the respective interconnecting lattice beams are connected to each other with the use of connectors 24. Referring also to Figure 6 of the drawings, each connector 24 comprises a pair of plates 26 and 28 which are connectable via a lug 30, located on the plate 28, which can be located in a hole 32 in the plate 26. The plate 26 has a number of gripping elements 34.1, 34.2, 34.3 and 34.4 as shown. The plate 28 carries corresponding gripping elements 36.1, 36.2, 36.3 and 36.4. The respective gripping elements of the two plates 26 and 28 are configured to co-operate to form four gripping formations when the plates are connected to each other.<br>
It is pointed out that a connector 24 could also be formed by using two plates 26 and doing away with the plate 28. In such a configuration the plates 26 are attached to each other with a bolt, which extends through the hole 32 of each plate, and a nut which is attached to the bolt.<br>
The operation of the connectors 24 will be explained with specific reference to the interconnection 22.4 where the lattice beams 16.1 and. 18.2 interconnect. This is clearly illustrated in the enlarged portion of Figure 5. As shown the latticework of the lattice beams interconnect at this position. The connector 24 has four gripping formations, generally indicated with the reference numerals 38, 40, 42 and 44. By gripping two support members 46 and 48 of the lattice beam 18.2 in the gripping formations 42 and 44 as well as two support members 50 and 52 of the lattice beam 16.1 in gripping formations 38 and 40, the connector 24 connects these two lattice beams. Finally the lug 30 which may include a screw threaded portion on which a fastener, typically a nut, can be located in position for locking the connector<br><br>
24 in place. The remaining interconnections, excluding those at the corners of the support structure, are connected in a similar manner.<br>
The connections at the corners of the support structure 12 will now be explained with specific reference to the support member 20.1, as shown in the enlarged portion of Figure 5, where the lattice beams 16.1 and 18.1 interconnect The pillar 20.1 comprises a square bar 54 to which supports 56 and 58 are wielded. Recesses, not shown in the drawings, are provided between the support 56 and the bar 54 and the support 58 and the bar 54. These recesses are for respectively receiving a bent end portion of a support member 60 of the lattice beam 16.1 and a bent end portion of a support member 62 of the lattice beam 18.1 as shown. The connector 24, having gripping formations 63, 64, 65 and 66, holds support members 68 and 70 of the lattice beam 18.1 as well as the support members 50 and 52 of the lattice beam 16.1 in position. In this case, as with connectors at the other corners, a lug on the lower plate 28 is provided by a portion 72 of the pillar bar 54 which protrudes through a hole, not shown, at the position where the lug 30 is normally situated. The connector 24 at this corner can now again be secured with a suitable fastener, typically a nut. The connections at the other corners are made in a similar fashion.<br>
It is pointed out that the connectors not only serve to connect adjacent lattice beams but also assist the lattice beams in carrying a load. In cases where very heavy loads are to be supported it is envisaged that the support members of the lattice beams could tend to be splayed apart. However by using the connectors described above, the support members are held in position and can not be forced apart.<br>
Figure 7 shows a second embodiment of the present invention wherein a billboard 74 is formed by configuring lattice beams as shown and connecting them with connectors as described above.<br>
Figure 8 shows a perspective view of a third embodiment in which the support structure of the invention has been incorporated, as was the case<br><br>
for the embodiment of Figures 1 to 6, in a telecommunications shelter, now indicated with the reference numeral 80. The support structure 82 of this embodiment is constructed in a manner similar to that which was described above. It is however in respect of the construction of the pillars that the embodiments differ. Here the pillars, indicated respectively with the reference numerals 84.1, 84.2, 84.3 and 84.4, are provided by angle irons 86 which are attached to footplates 88. The pillars 84.1, 84.2, 84.3 and 84.4 are connected to one another with the use of bent sheet metal shirts 90. As shown the outermost lattice beams 92 are carried inside the bent sheet metal shirts-90. It-will be appreciated that by hiding the lattice beams inside the bent sheet metal shirts, the aesthetic features of the telecommunications shelter 80 is enhanced.<br>
In order to prevent the pillars 84.1, 84.2, 84.3 and 84.4 from splaying outwardly in the event of the telecommunications shelter 80 being subjected to heavy loads, load bearing supports 94 are provided. As shown in Figure 8 a load bearing support 94, here in the form of a beam, is attached to the pillar 84.1 at one end and to a connector 24 at its other end. The other load bearing supports 94 are attached in a similar fashion to the remaining pillars.<br>
Figure 9 shows a perspective view of the telecommunications shelter 80 with its shelter portion removed to show a floor 96t while Figure 10 shows an exploded view of the connector 24. In this embodiment of the invention the connector 24 however includes a load spreading member 98, here a large washer, for spreading the load which is carried by the floor 96. In order to assist in securing the floor 96 in position the connector 24 also includes a counter sunk bolt 100.<br>
It will be appreciated that the support structure of the present invention could be used in a wide range of applications non-related to telecommunications structures. Such applications could include that containers, shelters of kiosks and prefabricated site offices, mobile homes and diners are carried on support structures as described above.<br><br>
The support structure as described above addresses the cost, labour and transport problems which are discussed in the background portion of this specification.<br><br>
