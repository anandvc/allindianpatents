Substituted lactams and their use as anti-cancer agents<br>
The present invention relates to the area of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. More particularly, the present invention relates to certain substituted lactams, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said lactam compounds, a method of treating cancer with said lactam compounds, and a process for preparing said lactam compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cancer is a serious health problem throughout the world. As a result, an extensive number of research endeavors has been undertaken in an effort to develop therapies appropriate to the treatment and alleviation of cancer in humans. Research has been conducted to develop anti-cancer agents effective against various types of cancer. Oftentimes, anticancer agents which have been developed and found effective against cancer cells are, unfortunately, also toxic to normal cells. This toxicity manifests itself in weight loss, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, itching, hallucinations, loss of appetite, and other undesirable effects.<br>
Additionally, conventionally used cancer treatment agent often do not have the effectiveness desired or are not as broadly effective against different types of cancers as desired. As a result, a great need exists for therapeutic agents which are not only more effective against multiple types of cancer, but which have a higher degree of selectivity for killing cancer cells with no or minimal effect on normal healthy cells. In addition, highly effective and selective anti-cancer agents, in particular, against cancers of the colon, bladder, prostate, stomach, pancreas, breast, lung, liver, brain, testis, ovary, cervix, skin, vulva, small intestine, lymph glands, and blood cells are desired. Moreover, anti-cancer activity against colon, breast lung, pancreas, and prostate cancers as well as melanomas are particularly desired because of the lack of any particular effective therapy at the present time.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides new anti-cancer agents which are effective against a variety of cancer cells in particular, against all liquid and solid cancers that may arise in a subject, including cancers of the colon, bladder, prostate, stomach, pancreas, breast, lung, liver,<br><br>
brain, testis, ovary, cervix, skin, vulva, small intestine, lymph glands, and blood cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to certain substituted lactams which exhibit a high degree of selectivity in killing cancer cells.<br>

The following compounds are prepared by similar methods utilizing analogous starting materials:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The anti-tumor activity of the compounds of formula I may be demonstrated employing the Anchorage Dependent Growth Monolayer Assay (ADGMA) which measures the growth inhibitory effects of test compounds on proliferation of adherent cell monolayers. This assay was adapted from the 60 cell line assay used by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with the following modifications: 1) cell lines representative for the important tumor types, for example, MDA-MB-435 breast and A549 non-small cell lung, are utilized; and 2) a tetrazolium derivative, wz, MTS, is utilized to determine cell density.<br>
The ADGMA compares the number of viable cells following a 3-day exposure to a test compound relative to a number of cells present at the time the test compound is added. Cell viability is measured using a tetrazolium derivative, wz, 3-(4,5-dimettiyIthiazol-2»yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl}-2H-tetrazoliumI inner salt (MTS) that is metabolically reduced in the presence of an electron coupling agent (PMS; phenazine methosulfate) by viable cells to a water-soluble formazan derivative. The absorbance at 490 nm (A490) of the formazan derivative is proportional to the number of viable cells. The IC50 for a test compound is the concentration of compound required to reduce the final cell number to 50% of the final control cell number.<br>
The MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma line is obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used between passages 4-20 following thawing. MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma is maintained and plated in DME/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 mM HEPES (pH=7.4), penicillin 100 units/mL, and streptomycin 100 micrograms/mL<br>
The A549 non-small cell lung lines are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used between passages 4-20 following thawing. A549 cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS, 5 mg/mL insulin, 5 mg/mL transferring, 5 mg/mL selenous acid, 1 nM [3- estradiol, 1 nM testosterone, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 ug/mL streptomycin.<br>
Cell lines are trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter to determine plating densities. Cells are then plated in their respective maintenance media (100 pL/well) in 96 well plates at the following densities: MDA-MB-435, 3,000 cells/well; A549, 700 cells/well. The number of cells plates as determined in preliminary experiments, results in cell densities of 75-90% of<br><br>
confluency by 4 days after plating. Initial cell densities, assayed one day after plating, are roughly 0.15-0.20 absorbance units greater than the media blank. Ninety-six well plates are seeded on day 0 and the test compounds are added on day 1. A control plate is created for each cell Fine that receives media only in row A and cells in row B. One day following plating, test compounds are added (in a final volume of 100 pL) to the test plates. Control plates receive 10 pL MTS mixture (prepared fresh on day of addition to cell plates at a ratio of 10 pL of a 0.92 mg/mL solution of PMS to a 190 pL of a 2 mg/mL solution of MTS) and 100 pL media. A490 of control plates is read 4 h after MTS addition to determine initial cell density values for each cell line. Three days after addition of the test compound, 10 pL/wel! of MTS mixture is added to the test plates and A490 is read 4 h later. A490 values for wells containing cells are corrected for media absorbance, then normalized to initial density readings to determine percent net growth. IC50 values are determined from graphs of percent net growth as a function of compound concentration. Percent net growth is calculated as (Cell + Drug A490 - Initial A49o/Cell + Drug Vehicle A490 - Initial A490).<br>
Each of the compounds of Examples 1-59 shows an IC50 value in the range from 0.001 pM to 100 pM in the ADGMA with at least one carcinoma cell line.<br><br><br>
