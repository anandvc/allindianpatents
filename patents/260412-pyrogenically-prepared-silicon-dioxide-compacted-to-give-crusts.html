				<td>Pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide compacted to<br>
give crusts<br>
The invention relates to pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide compacted to give crusts, to a process for the<br>
production of the crusts from pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide, and also to their use.<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be prepared by means of high temperature or flame<br>
hydrolysis from SiCl4 or from other volatile silicon<br>
compounds (Ullmann's Enzyklopadie der technischen<br>
Chemie [Ullmann's encyclopaedia of industrial<br>
chemistry], 4th Edition, Vol. 21, page 464 (1982)).<br>
Features of pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxides are<br>
extremely fine particles, low bulk density, high<br>
specific surface area, very high purity, spherical<br>
particle shape and the absence of pores.<br>
Compacting of pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
without binder is difficult because pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide is very dry and there are no<br>
capillary forces that can bring about binding of the<br>
particles.<br>
Pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide often has high<br>
surface charge which acts electrostatically to make<br>
agglomeration more difficult. Furthermore, pyrogeni-<br>
cally prepared silicon dioxide has a maximum moisture<br>
content of 1%.<br>
It is known that colloidal silicon dioxide, which<br>
derives from the exhaust gas from silicon smelting<br>
ovens, can be subject to bulk-density increase by<br>
passing the colloidal silicon dioxide almost<br>
horizontally through a pair of vertically arranged<br>
compression rollers (US 5,160,470).<br><br>
That reference makes no mention of pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide.<br>
It is known that fine-particle substances can be<br>
subject to bulk-density increase by means of two screw<br>
compactors arranged at right angles to one another (US<br>
3,664,385).<br>
It is known that powders, such as silica, can be<br>
subject to bulk-density increase by means of vacuum<br>
rolls arranged in groups (US 3,632,247).<br>
It is known that powders can be subject to bulk-density<br>
increase by means of a screw compactor and that the air<br>
escaping during that process can be returned in order<br>
to reduce powder loss (US 5,052,874).<br>
For certain applications and transport methods it is<br>
known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxides can<br>
be subject to bulk-density increase or can be formed to<br>
give pellets.<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be subject to bulk-density increase by means of the<br>
apparatus according to US 5,052,874 (US 6,156,285).<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be subject to bulk-density increase by using a<br>
compactor screw which has decreasing pitch (US<br>
4,326,852).<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared oxides, such as<br>
pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide, can be subject<br>
to bulk-density increase by means of gas-permeable<br>
belts (US 4,325,686). The density achieved by this<br>
known process is less than 100 g/1.<br><br>
US 4,325,686, column 3, discloses that pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide (fumed silica) can be subject<br>
to bulk-density increase by means of the apparatus<br>
according to US 3,838,785, US 3,742,566, US 3,762,851<br>
and US 3,860,682. The maximum tamped bulk density given<br>
by this process is 180 g/1.<br>
The known processes do not give defined compactates.<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be subject to bulk-density increase by means of a<br>
pressure-belt filter (EP 0280851 Bl) . However, this<br>
process likewise does not give defined compactates.<br>
It is known that metal oxides whose primary particle<br>
size is from 1 to 500 |im can be formed to give<br>
compactates and that these compactates can be<br>
separately welded into foils in vacuo. These vacuum<br>
panels thus manufactured to a given specification can<br>
be used for thermal insulation, for example in<br>
refrigerators (US 6,132,837).<br>
It is known that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be subject to bulk-density increase by means of a<br>
transport screw (EP 0010655 A1) . Again, this process<br>
does not give defined compactates.<br>
It is moreover known that pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide can be moulded to give pellets, by<br>
dispersing the silicon dioxide in water and spray-<br>
drying the material. These pellets can be used as<br>
catalyst supports (DE 196 01 415).<br>
It is known that precipitated silica whose moisture<br>
content cannot be below 1% can be subject to bulk-<br>
density increase by means of filter rolls (DE B<br>
1807714). The disadvantage of this process is that it<br>
can achieve bulk-density increase only when a silica<br><br>
comprises water.<br>
It was an object to subject pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide to bulk-density increase in such a way<br>
as to give a flowable product with defined particle<br>
size, with good metering capability, with high bulk<br>
density and with low dust content.<br>
The invention provides a pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide compacted to give crusts, characterized in that<br>
its tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) is from<br>
185 to 700 g/1.<br>
The tamped bulk density can be from 191 to 700 g/1,<br>
preferably from 200 to 700 g/1.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-<br>
11) can be from 200 to 450 g/1.<br>
According to the invention, the tamped bulk density of<br>
a hydrophilic pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
compacted to give crusts can preferably be from 191 to<br>
700, in particular from 200 to 700, and also from 200<br>
to 450 g/1.<br>
The tamped bulk density of a hydrophobic pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide compacted to give crusts can<br>
be from 201 to 700 g/1, preferably from 210 to 700 g/1,<br>
especially preferred from 210 to 450 g/1.<br>
Crusts are the term used for the somewhat strip-like<br>
intermediate products which are produced by pressure on<br>
the starting material during roll compacting. They are<br>
comminuted in a second step.<br>
The properties of the crusts can be influenced via the<br>
process variables, e.g. the process control system<br><br>
provided, the compacting force, the width of the gap<br>
between the two rolls and the pressure retention time,<br>
which is adjusted via an appropriate alteration in the<br>
rotation rates of the compression rolls.<br>
Compacting means achievement of a bulk-density increase<br>
by mechanical means without addition of binders. In one<br>
particular embodiment of the invention, the crusts have<br>
a clearly defined shape, and the size distribution here<br>
can be adjusted by means of sieving.<br>
The inventive pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
compacted to give crusts is very stable during<br>
transport.<br>
The invention further provides a process for production<br>
of the pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide whose<br>
tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) is from 185<br>
to 700 g/1 compacted to give crusts, characterized in<br>
that pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide is subject<br>
to preliminary de-aeration and, respectively, to bulk-<br>
density increase, and is compacted to give crusts, and<br>
the crusts are broken and, if appropriate, classified.<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram of the inventive process.<br>
According to Figure 1, the pyrogenically prepared sili-<br>
con dioxide is subject to preliminary bulk-density<br>
increase or is de-aerated by means of known methods and<br>
apparatuses in the "preliminary de-aeration" step. This<br>
step is needed if pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide is used which is not subject to bulk-density<br>
increase, possibly having been freshly prepared.<br>
If a pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide is used<br>
which has been previously subject to preliminary bulk-<br>
density increase, this preliminary de-aeration step can<br>
be omitted.<br><br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide which has<br>
been subject to preliminary de-aeration is subject to<br>
bulk-density increase (compacted) to the desired tamped<br>
bulk density in the "compacting" step.<br>
After compacting, the crusts are broken. Classification<br>
or sieving can then be carried out, if appropriate.<br>
The fines produced during sieving can be returned to<br>
the preliminary de-aeration step.<br>
According to the invention, the starting material for<br>
preliminary de-aeration can comprise a silicon dioxide<br>
which has not been subject to bulk-density increase, or<br>
which has been subject to preliminary bulk-density<br>
increase.<br>
The preliminary de-aeration process can be carried out<br>
prior to transport or during transport to the compact-<br>
ing process.<br>
Prior to transport to the compacting process, the<br>
preliminary de-aeration process can be carried out by<br>
means of a pipe to which a vacuum is applied and which<br>
is composed of a sintered material, e.g. sintered<br>
metal.<br>
The preliminary de-aeration process can moreover be<br>
carried out in the transport screw, and the transport<br>
screw here may be downstream of the apparatus which<br>
encompasses a pipe to which vacuum is applied.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the transport<br>
screw can be used as the sole apparatus for the<br>
preliminary de-aeration process.<br>
The preliminary de-aeration process can moreover be<br><br>
carried out by means of a transport screw arranged<br>
within a pipe to which vacuum is applied. The pipe to<br>
which vacuum is applied can be composed of a sintered<br>
jacket, e.g. sintered metal.<br>
If the apparatus is composed of a preliminary deaeration<br>
pipe, e.g. of a pipe to which vacuum is<br>
applied, and of a downstream transport screw, the<br>
preliminary de-aeration process can be carried out in<br>
the pipe, if a silicon dioxide is used which has not<br>
been subject to bulk-density increase.<br>
If a silicon dioxide which has been subject to<br>
preliminary bulk-density increase is used, the<br>
preliminary de-aeration process can likewise be carried<br>
out in the pipe. It is also possible to omit this<br>
preliminary de-aeration step.<br>
If exclusively the transport screw is used for the<br>
preliminary de-aeration process, it is necessary to use<br>
silicon dioxide which has been subject to preliminary<br>
bulk-density increase.<br>
If the preliminary de-aeration process uses the<br>
apparatus which has a transport screw within a pipe to<br>
which vacuum is applied, it is possible to use either<br>
silicon dioxide which has not been subject to bulk-<br>
density increase or else silicon dioxide which has been<br>
subject to preliminary bulk-density increase.<br>
The preliminary de-aeration of the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide can moreover take place by<br>
means of filtration on a filter medium, e.g. a cloth or<br>
sintered material, e.g. sintered metal, sintered<br>
plastic, sintered ceramic, porous glass, with<br>
continuous filtercake removal via, for example, a<br>
conveying screw or a scraper. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, a sintered metal pipe can be used with a<br><br>
metering screw.<br>
The preliminary de-aeration can moreover take place by<br>
means of sedimentation, where the break-up of solid<br>
bridges is promoted via additional use of vibration or<br>
sound or via slow stirring.<br>
The starting material used can be a hydrophilic,<br>
pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide or a<br>
hydrophobic, pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide.<br>
The hydrophobic pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
can be prepared by means of surface modification.<br>

In one embodiment of the	invention, the starting<br>
material used can comprise	a pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide subject to	preliminary bulk-density<br>
increase.<br>
When the pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide used is<br>
not subject to bulk-density increase its tamped bulk<br>
density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) can be smaller than<br>
50 g/1, preferably from 20 to 30 g/1. The pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide used which is subject to<br>
preliminary bulk-density increase can have a tamped<br>
bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of from 50 to<br>
190 g/1, preferably from 100 to 150 g/1, and the tamped<br>
bulk density here (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of a<br>
hydrophobic pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
subject to preliminary bulk-density increase can be<br>
from 90 to 120 g/1.<br>
In the state not subject to bulk-density increase, the<br>
hydrophilic silicon dioxide used can have a tamped bulk<br><br>
density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) smaller than 50 g/1,<br>
preferably from 20 to 30 g/1.<br>
In the state subject to preliminary bulk-density<br>
increase, the hydrophilic silicon dioxide can have a<br>
tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of from 50<br>
to 190 g/1, preferably from 100 to 150 g/1.<br>
In the state subject to preliminary bulk-density<br>
increase, the hydrophobic silicon dioxide can have a<br>
tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of from 50<br>
to 190 g/1, preferably from 90 to 120 g/1.<br>
The primary particle size of the pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide used can be from 5 to 50 nm and its BET<br>
surface area can be from 40 to 400 m2/g, preferably<br>
from 100 to 2 50 m2/g.<br>
The water content of the pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide used can be smaller than 1% by weight.<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide can be<br>
subject to preliminary bulk-density increase by means<br>
of known processes and apparatuses. By way of example,<br>
the apparatuses according to US 4,325,686, US<br>
4,877,595, US 3,838,785, US 3,742,566, US 3,762,851, US<br>
3,860,682 can be used.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
possible to use a pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide which has been subject to preliminary bulk-<br>
density increase by means of a pressure-belt filter<br>
according to EP 0280851 Bl or US 4,877,595.<br>
By way of example, the transport of the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide to the compacting process can<br>
take place by means of a screw.<br><br>
This transport consists in forcing the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide into the nip of the compacting<br>
rolls. If a conveying screw is not used, it is<br>
necessary to use a pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide which has been subject to preliminary bulk-<br>
density increase.<br>
If a conveying screw is used, the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide may not be subject to<br>
preliminary bulk-density increase, because preliminary<br>
de-aeration takes place here.<br>
In order to achieve high bulk densities of the crusts,<br>
it is possible to use a conveying screw and a<br>
pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide subject to<br>
preliminary bulk-density increase.<br>
The conveying screw used can comprise a screw with<br>
decreasing volume or with increasing pitch or with<br>
decreasing diameter.<br>
Surrounding the conveying screw there can be a pipe to<br>
which vacuum is applied. This pipe can be composed of a<br>
sintered jacket. The preliminary de-aeration of the<br>
silicon dioxide takes place here in the transport screw<br>
simultaneously with the transport into the nip.<br>
Compacting to give crusts can take place by means of<br>
two rolls, of which one, or else both simultaneously,<br>
can have a de-aerating function.<br>
It is preferable to use two compacting rolls, which can<br>
be smooth. They can also have a profile. The profile<br>
can be present either only on one compacting roll or<br>
else on both compacting rolls.<br>
The profile can be composed of grooves parallel to the<br>
axis. As an alternative, it can be composed of recesses<br><br>
(depressions) of any desired shape, arranged in any<br>
desired manner.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, at least one of<br>
the rolls can be a vacuum roll. In this embodiment, the<br>
roll can have been covered with sintered metal.<br>
In order to bring about the de-aeration function, the<br>
roll can have been produced from sintered metal or can<br>
have been covered with a filter medium, for example<br>
with a cloth.<br>
If de-aeration of the pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide is possible by means of the rolls, it is<br>
possible to omit the additional preliminary de-aeration<br>
which can take place in the conveying screw or in the<br>
feed pipe.<br>
If the roll is used for preliminary de-aeration, the<br>
roll can have a smooth or profiled surface, and this<br>
surface can be only slightly grooved, in order to<br>
improve take-up of the product.<br>
The compacting process should ensure uniform<br>
compression of the pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide, in order to give crusts with uniform density.<br>
Apparatus as shown in Figure 2 can be used to carry out<br>
the compacting process.<br>
According to Figure 2, the pyrogenically prepared<br>
silicon dioxide is introduced by means of the screw 1<br>
into the chamber 2 between the two rolls 3 and is<br>
pressed between the two rolls to give crusts.<br>
The inventive process can moreover be carried out by<br>
using an apparatus as described in the document DE B<br>
1807714.<br><br>
It is preferable to use smooth rolls in the compacting<br>
process, in order to avoid grit. It is moreover<br>
possible to use one or two rolls composed of sintered<br>
material, e.g. sintered metal or sintered ceramic, by<br>
way of which de-aeration can take place.<br>
After the compacting process, the crusts are broken. A<br>
sieving granulator can be used for this purpose, and<br>
its sieve mesh width prescribes the grain size. The<br>
mesh width can be from 250 (m to 20 mm.<br>
For breaking of the crusts it is moreover possible to<br>
use an apparatus with two counter-rotating rolls with a<br>
defined gap, or a toothed roll.<br>
The broken crusts can be classified by means of a<br>
sifter, a sieve or a classifier. The fines (particles<br>
smaller than 200 m) can thereby be removed.<br>
Sifters that can be used are cross-flow sifters,<br>
countercurrent baffle-type sifters.<br>
A cyclone can be used as classifier.<br>
The fines (particles smaller than 200 xn) removed<br>
during classification can be returned to the inventive<br>
process.<br>
Determination of tamped bulk density<br>
Tamped bulk density was measured to DIN EN ISO 787-11.<br>
Prior to the measurements, the specimens were passed<br>
through a 5 mm sieve in order to break up large<br>
agglomerates and obtain reproducible measurements.<br>
Determination of dust content<br><br>
Dust content is determined to DIN 55992-2.<br>
The comparative pyrogenic silica products subject to<br>
bulk-density increase by the apparatus according to EP<br>
0 280 851 Al, and the inventive crusts, were passed<br>
through a 5 mm sieve prior to the measurements, in<br>
order to break up large agglomerates and obtain<br>
reproducible measurements.<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the test device for<br>
determination of dust content.<br>
To determine dust content, a weighed-out amount (3 g)<br>
of the inventive crusts or of the comparative product<br>
according to EP 0 280 851 Al is charged to a feed<br>
system at the upper end of the vertical pipe. This has<br>
been sealed below by flaps prior to the start of the<br>
test. The end of the vertical pipe has been sealed. At<br>
the start of the test, this flap is opened for a<br>
certain period so that the specimen can drop into the<br>
vertical pipe. The specimen dissipates dust into the<br>
air during the drop and on impact on the base of the<br>
vertical pipe. Air turbulence during the drop provides<br>
uniform distribution of the dust in the pipe. Sedimen-<br>
tation of the suspended material then begins. The light<br>
extinction brought about by the suspended material at<br>
the lower end of the vertical pipe is measured via a<br>
photometric sensor. The sedimentation curve is<br>
indicated by a PC as extinction as a function of time.<br>
Extinction is a measure of relative particle concentra-<br>
tion .<br>
From the curve of extinction as a function of time it<br>
is possible to determine the cumulative dust values.<br>
The cumulative dust values are determined as follows<br>
from the sedimentation curve measured from an initial<br>
time ta to the end of the test after 30 s:<br><br><br>
These cumulative dust values describe the amount of<br>
dust liberated. The cumulative dust value from 16 s to<br>
30 s is also termed the "dust value". It contains<br>
information on fine dust or is a measure of fine dust<br>
content.<br>
The cumulative dust value from 1 s to 30 s describes<br>
the total amount of dust, composed of coarse dust and<br>
fine dust.<br>
The inventive crusts of a pyrogenic silica differ in<br>
these two values from pyrogenic silica subject to bulk-<br>
density increase by an apparatus according to EP 0 280<br>
851 Al.<br>
Example<br>
Comparison of the dust performance of pyrogenic silica<br>
subject to bulk-density increase in an apparatus<br>
according to EP 0 280 851 Al with the inventive crusts<br>
of a pyrogenic silica. The BET surface area of both<br>
specimens is 150 m2/g.<br>
Figure 7 shows the curve of extinction as a function of<br>
time or of relative dust concentration during the<br>
determination described above of dust content of the<br>
two specimens. This curve shows that the inventive<br>
compactates sediment substantially more rapidly and<br>
that after 16 s there is less fine dust remaining in<br>
suspension than with pyrogenic silica subject to bulk-<br>
density increase according to EP 0 280 851 Al. Over the<br>
entire duration of the test, the inventive crusts<br>
liberate substantially less dust than does the<br>
pyrogenic silica subject to bulk-density increase<br><br>
according to EP 0 280 851 Al. Extinction assumes<br>
markedly lower numeric values in Figure 7 for the<br>
inventive crusts.<br>
Table 1: Comparison of total dust contents and fine<br>
dust contents (dust values = cumulative dust value from<br>
1 s to 30 s and from 16 s to 30 s)<br><br>
The statistical independence of the dust values of the<br>
two experimental products was demonstrated via the T test.<br>
12 replicating experiments were carried out from each<br>
specimen.<br>
The cumulative dust values in the determination<br>
described above of dust contents differ markedly from<br>
one another. Firstly, pyrogenic silica subject to bulk-<br>
density increase according to EP 0 280 851 Al<br>
generates, with a I (ls) value of 207, significantly<br>
more coarse and fine dust than the inventive crusts<br>
with a I (ls) value of 113. Furthermore, the crusts have<br>
a fine dust value (I (16s)) of 40, whereas pyrogenic<br>
silica subject to bulk-density increase by an apparatus<br>
according to EP 0 280 851 Al has a substantially higher<br>
dust value: 62. That means that the inventive compact-<br>
ing process to give crusts can significantly reduce not<br>
only the total dust content but also the fine dust<br>
content when comparison is made with bulk-density<br><br>
increase according to EP 0 280 851 Al.<br>
Figure 4 compares the fine dust content of the<br>
pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide compacted by<br>
means of the inventive process to give crusts and the<br>
fine dust contents of pyrogenic silicon dioxide subject<br>
to bulk-density increase in a known manner.<br>
Starting materials used for the inventive process<br>
comprise a pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide<br>
subject to bulk-density increase by means of the<br>
pressure-belt filter according to EP 0 280 851 Bl.<br>
Figure 4 shows a measure of the particle size distribution<br>
and the average particle size of the loose powder<br>
and, respectively, of the loose crusts produced by the<br>
inventive process. It is apparent here that the<br>
inventive crusts of the pyrogenically prepared silicon<br>
dioxide sediment significantly better and generate<br>
significantly less dust than the granulated material<br>
according to EP 0 725 037 Al.<br>
Figure 4 moreover shows a measure of content of fine or<br>
suspended dust. It is apparent here that the content of<br>
suspended dust can be drastically reduced for the<br>
inventive crusts. In the case of granulated material<br>
according to EP 0 725 037 Al, a large proportion<br>
remains suspended for a very long time.<br>
Figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution (Q-3<br>
distribution) of granulated materials according to EP 0<br>
725 037 Al and according to the invention.<br>
The inventive crusts where X 
average particle size in laser diffraction spectroscopy<br>
as the granulated material according to EP 0 725 037<br>
Al. In both cases it is ~ 35 m.<br><br>
The inventive crusts generate significantly less dust,<br>
however.<br>
The fractions of the crusts were prepared via sieving<br>
granulation using a sieve of mesh width 500 m and<br>
subsequent sieving on a 250 m sieve. The fraction x<br>
The fraction whose particle size was from 250 to 500 m<br>
was the coarse product.<br>
Figure 6 shows the granulated form of the pyrogenically<br>
prepared silicon dioxide inventively compacted to give<br>
crusts after breaking and sieving. It has an angled<br>
shape.<br>
The granulated materials according to DE 19601415 have<br>
spherical appearance.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
tamped bulk density (to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of the<br>
crusts obtained is from 200 to 400 g/1. These crusts<br>
then have the necessary strength not to break apart<br>
again in the subsequent steps. However, they can be<br>
dispersed again readily.<br>
The crusts obtained are moreover porous.<br>
The inventive crusts have an advantageously low dust<br>
content after breaking, even without sieving or<br>
classification.<br>
The agglomerate hardness of the inventive crusts is<br>
smaller than 50N, measured by ERWEKA 30.<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide compacted to<br>
give crusts has, after sieving, no fines content with<br>
diameter smaller than 200 m.<br><br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide inventively<br>
compacted to give crusts has a low dust content<br>
advantageous for all applications. It can be<br>
incorporated into mixtures without loss and without<br>
dust contamination.<br>
Although the pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide has<br>
been compacted, the inventive crusts have sufficient<br>
redispersibility for rubber mixtures. The redispersibility<br>
is not sufficient for use in silicone rubber<br>
compositions.<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide inventively<br>
compacted to give crusts has no binder content.<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide inventively<br>
compacted to give crusts can be used as filler in<br>
rubber mixtures.<br>
The inventive crusts and a pyrogenically prepared<br>
silica subject to bulk-density increase according to EP<br>
0 280 851 were incorporated into silicone polymer.<br>
Formulation<br>
Stage 1<br>
100 parts, 400 g, of Silopren VS silicone polymer<br>
(Bayer AG)<br>
40 parts, 160 g, of synthetic silica<br>
6 parts, 24 g, of VP AC 3031 silicone oil processing<br>
aid (Bayer AG)<br>
Stage 2<br>
0.5% of Interox DCLBP-50-PSI bis(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)<br>
peroxide (Peroxid-Chemie GmbH)<br><br>
Mixing specification (Carried out at room tempera-<br>
ture)<br>
Polymix 200 U two-roll mill from Schwabenthan<br>
Roll diameter:	200 mm<br>
Roll length:	400 mm<br>
Nip:	0.9 ± 0.05 mm<br>
Rotation rate:	20 rpm, friction: 1:1.3<br>
Stage 1<br>
400 g of silicone polymer are added to the two-roll<br>
mill.<br>
As soon as a homogeneous milled sheet has formed on the<br>
operator roll (faster-running roll), the filler can be<br>
added. The silica is added slowly and in portions<br>
between the two rolls. After about 50% of filler<br>
addition, the compounded material is removed from the<br>
roll by the scraper and turned.<br>
For the formulation with processing aid, this is now<br>
added to the two-roll mill in the form of a mixture of<br>
24 g of processing aid in about 10 g of the silica<br>
(somewhat mixed by a spatula). The remaining 50% of the<br>
amount of filler are then added.<br>
For dispersion and homogenization of the silica,<br>
milling is continued for a further 5 min after incorporation<br>
of the filler. During the process the mixture<br>
is turned 5 more times. The mixtures thus prepared are<br>
stored for 1 week to permit continued wetting of the<br>
silica. For this purpose, the compounded materials are<br>
wrapped in PE film.<br>
Stage 2<br>
For plastification, the compounded material is mixed on<br><br>
the roll mill until a homogeneous milled sheet is<br>
produced. The previously weighed-out amount of peroxide<br>
is then administered with a spatula (made of wood or<br>
plastic) . Milling is continued for a further 8 min for<br>
dispersion and homogenization of the peroxide, the<br>
scraper being used here to remove the mixture from the<br>
roll and turn it 8 times.<br>
Storage for 24 hours at room temperature (advantageously<br>
in PE film) then again follows.<br>
Prior to vulcanization, the compounded material is<br>
again plasticized on the two-roll mill.<br>
Vulcanization<br>
The heating press is preheated to: 140°C<br>
Silicone sheets of thickness 2 mm (pressing time 7 min)<br>
and 6 mm (pressing time 10 min) are vulcanized in the<br>
preheated press between chromed steel plates.<br>
In order to remove cleavage products of the peroxide,<br>
the sheets are post-vulcanized at 200°C for 6 hours in<br>
a hot-air oven. In the 1st hour the oven door is opened<br>
for 60 seconds about every 10 minutes. In the 2nd and<br>
3rd hour, every 30 minutes. Not more than 1200 g of<br>
vulcanisates are suspended in the ovens, whose volume<br>
is 0.125 m3.<br><br><br>
It is apparent that the inventive crusts cannot be<br>
sufficiently dispersed in silicone polymer. They have<br>
relatively high strength.<br>

polymer. Photographic-quality visualization of surface<br>
