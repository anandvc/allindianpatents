APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SUPPORTING RELAY<br>
SERVICE IN A MULTI-HOP RELAY BROADBAND WIRELESS<br>
ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to a multi-hop relay Broadband Wireless<br>
Access (BWA) communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method<br>
for providing synchronization channels to Mobile Stations (MSs) and Relay Stations<br>
(RSs) and eliminating near-far interference between a direct service and a relay service<br>
in a multi-hop relay BWA communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
One of the most critical requirements for deployment of a 4th Generation (4G) com-<br>
munication system is to build a self-configurable wireless network. The self-<br>
configurable wireless network refers to a wireless network configured in an<br>
autonomous or distributed manner without control of a central system to provide<br>
mobile communication services. For the 4G communication system, cells of very small<br>
radiuses are defined for the purpose of enabling high-speed communications and ac-<br>
commodating a larger number of calls. Hence, a conventional centralized wireless<br>
network design is not viable. Rather, the wireless network should be built to be under<br>
distributed control and to actively cope with an environmental change like addition of<br>
new Base Stations (BSs). As a result, the 4G communication system requires the self-<br>
configurable wireless network.<br>
For real deployment of the self-configurable wireless network, techniques used for an<br>
ad hoc network should be introduced to a wireless access communication system. Such<br>
a major example is a multi-hop relay BWA communication system configured by<br>
applying a multi-hop relay scheme used for the ad hoc network to a BWA network<br>
with fixed BSs.<br>
In general, since a BS and an MS communicate with each other via a direct link, a<br>
highly reliable radio link can be established easily between them in the BWA com-<br>
munication system. However, due to the BSs being fixed, the configuration of a<br>
wireless network is not flexible, making it difficult to provide an efficient service in a<br>
radio environment experiencing a fluctuating traffic distribution and a great change in<br>
the number of required calls.<br>
The above drawback can be overcome by a relay service that delivers data over<br>
multiple hops via a plurality of neighbor MSs or neighbor RSs. The use of the multi-<br>
hop relay scheme facilitates fast network reconfiguration adaptive to an environmental<br><br>
change and renders the overall wireless network operation efficient. Also, a radio<br>
channel in a better channel status can be provided to an MS by installing an RS<br>
between the BS and the MS and thus establishing a multi-hop relay path via the RS. In<br>
this way, high-speed data channels can be provided to MSs in a shadowing area or an<br>
area where communications with the BS are unavailable. Cell coverage can also be<br>
expanded.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates service provisioning in a typical multi-hop relay BWA com-<br>
munication system.<br>
In FIG. 1, in the multi-hop relay BWA communication system, MSs 140 to 170<br>
(MS1 to MS4) can receive the BWA services through a BS 100, a primary RS (RS1)<br>
110, and secondary RSs (RS2) 120 and 130.<br>
MS1 and MS2 within the service area 101 of the BS 100 communicate with the BS<br>
100 via direct links L1. MS2, which is located at the cell boundary of the BS 100 and<br>
thus placed in a poor channel state, can receive a higher-speed data channel via an RS-<br>
MS link L2 between MS2 and RS2 130 than via the direct link L1.<br>
MS3 and MS4 outside the service area 101 of the BS 100 communicate with the BS<br>
100 via RS-MS links L3 provided by RS1 110. The communication links between the<br>
BS 100 and MS3 and MS4 via RS1 110 expand the cell coverage. MS4, which is<br>
located at the cell boundary of RS1 110 and thus placed in a poor channel state, can<br>
increase its transmission capacity using an RS-MS link L4 between MS4 and RS2 120.<br>
As described above, when an MS is in a poor channel state at a cell boundary of a BS<br>
or in a shadowing area suffering from a severe shielding effect due to, for example,<br>
buildings, the BWA communication system enables the MS to communicate with the<br>
BS by providing a better-quality radio channel to the MS via an RS. In other words, the<br>
BS can provide high-speed data channels to the cell boundary and the shadowing area<br>
and expand its coverage area by the multi-hop relay scheme. The RSs 110, 120 and<br>
130 are classified into RS1 (RS 110) that expands cell coverage and RS2 (the RSs 120<br>
and 130) that increases capacity according to their relay capabilities.<br>
Typically, transmission/reception is carried out between a BS and an MS in frames<br>
having the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2 in the BWA communication system. FIG.<br>
2 illustrates a Time Division Duplex (TDD) frame structure compliant with Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16, for data transmission/reception<br>
between the BS and the MS.<br>
In FIG. 2, a TDD frame 200 is divided into a DownLink (DL) subframe 210 and an<br>
UpLink (UL) subframe 220 with a guard region called Transmit/receive Transition<br>
Gap (TTG) in between. A guard region called Receive/transmit Transition Gap (RTG)<br>
is interposed between TDD frames.<br>
The DL subframe 210 includes a preamble and a common control channel in<br><br>
mandatory slots. The MSs within the service area of the BS acquire synchronization<br>
and control information from the preamble and the common control channel.<br>
As described above, the BWA communication system provides services to the MSs<br>
or RSs outside the cell coverage of the BS or in a shadowing area by use of the RSs. In<br>
order to ensure backward compatibility for the MSs, communications are conducted in<br>
frames configured as illustrated in FIG. 2. That is, an RS operates in the same manner<br>
as an MS during initial access and negotiates a relay operation with the BS so that BS<br>
can provide a relay service to MSs in frames having the configuration of FIG. 2.<br>
Because the RS provides the relay service using the same frame configuration as the<br>
BS, it has difficulty in concurrently communicating with the BS and the MSs over one<br>
frequency band in one frame. To avert a Radio Frequency (RF) isolation problem<br>
caused by the frame configuration illustrated in FIG. 2, the frames are configured as il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 3 so that transmission to and reception from the RS occur in parallel<br>
in time.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a TDD frame structure in a conventional multi-hop relay BWA<br>
communication system.<br>
In FIG. 3, a DL subframe 300 is divided into a first area 301 and a second area 303,<br>
and a UL subframe 310 is divided into a first area 311 and a second area 313. For the<br>
RS operation transitions, the first areas 301 and 311 are distinguished from the second<br>
areas 311 and 313 in time division. The lengths of the first areas 301 and 311 and the<br>
lengths of the second areas 311 and 313 are fixed or adaptively adjusted according to a<br>
cell environment.<br>
The BWA communication system provides a direct link service in the first areas 301<br>
and 311 and a relay link service in the second areas 303 and 313. Hence, the BS<br>
provides a synchronization channel, a control channel, and a traffic channel to an MS<br>
connected to it by a direct link in the first areas 301 and 311 and a synchronization<br>
channel, a control channel, and a traffic channel to an RS in the second areas 303 and<br>
313.<br>
Since the RS may move as illustrated in FIG. 4, the BWA communication system<br>
should consider the mobility of the RS.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates movement of the RS in the conventional multi-hop relay BWA<br>
communication system.<br>
In FIG. 4, being located in a vehicle such as a bus or a train, RS1 420 has mobility.<br>
Hence, the BWA communication system should provide a synchronization channel to<br>
RS1 420 for synchronization and cell search, taking into account its mobility.<br>
In the case of the frame configuration illustrated in FIG. 3, the lengths of the first and<br>
second areas 301 and 303 of the DL subframe 300 may vary depending on a cell en-<br>
vironment. The resulting change in the position of the synchronization channel at the<br><br>
start of the second area 303 imposes overhead because RS1 420 should locate the syn-<br>
chronization channels of the neighbor BSs. Increased interference between neighbor<br>
cells due to the power boost of synchronization channels, transmission of information<br>
about the neighbor BSs, and search for the synchronization channel of each neighbor<br>
BS add to the RS overhead.<br>
Without providing the synchronization channels, RS2's 120 and 130, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1, provide the relay service in conjunction with the BS by multiple commu-<br>
nications in the cell. In this case, an MS experiences near-far interference because of<br>
the power difference between a signal received from BS 100 or the RS1 110 and a<br>
signal received from the RS2 120 or 130, as illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a signal flow for a relay service from an RS in the conventional<br>
multi-hop relay BWA communication system.<br>
In FIG. 5, within the cell area of a BS 500, a first MS 530 (MS1) in a good channel<br>
status receives a service from the BS 500 via a direct link and a second MS 520 (MS2)<br>
in a poor channel status receives the service via RS2 510.<br>
Although BS 500 and RS2 510 perform multiple communications using orthogonal<br>
resources in the same time area, a BS link signal is overlaid with an RS link signal in<br>
the air. Thus, MS 1 may undergo near-far interference as it receives a stronger in-<br>
terference signal from the nearby RS2 510 than a signal from BS 510. The near-far in-<br>
terference may also occur to the uplink as RS2 510 receives a stronger interference<br>
signal from MS1 than a signal from MS2.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention provides a technique for providing a synchronization channel<br>
to support the mobility of an RS and eliminating near-far interference caused by<br>
multiple communications within a cell in a multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system. The following description will be made in the context of a Time Division<br>
Duplex (TDD)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM) wireless<br>
communication system, while the present invention is also applicable to a com-<br>
munication system using any other multiple access scheme or any other division<br>
duplex scheme.<br>
The term 'primary RS' or 'RS1' is defined as an RS that expands cell coverage and the<br><br>
term 'secondary RS' or 'RS2' is defined as an RS that increases capacity. Therefore, the<br>
RS1 provides a synchronization channel, a control channel, and traffic channels to the<br>
MSs or the RSs outside the cell area of a BS, whereas the RS2 provides unicast control<br>
and traffic channels to the MSs in a poor channel status though located in the cell area<br>
of the BS.<br>
While it is described herein that a subframe is configured in compliance with the<br>
IEEE 802.16 standard for communications between a BS and an RS, it is obviously to<br>
be understood that an advanced technology with novel functionalities and usages is<br>
also applicable. The same holds true for communications with an upper RS (or super-<br>
ordinated RS) and a lower RS.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a frame structure that provides synchronization channels to the MSs<br>
and the RSs in a multi-hop relay BWA communication system according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In FIG. 6, a frame is composed of a DL subframe 610 and a UL subframe 620. The<br>
DL subframe 610 includes time-multiplexed first and second areas 611 and 613, and<br>
the UL subframe 620 includes time-multiplexed first and second areas 621 and 623.<br>
The lengths of the first areas 611 and 621 and the lengths of the second areas 621 and<br>
623 may be fixed or vary depending on a cell environment.<br>
A BS communicates with an MS connected to it via a direct link in the first areas 611<br>
and 621, and communicates with an RS in the second areas 613 and 623. As the<br>
lengths of the first areas 611 and 621 and the second areas 613 and 623 may vary dy-<br>
namically according to the cell environment as mentioned above, the BS allocates syn-<br>
chronization channels at the start of the first area 611 and at the end of the second area<br>
613 so that the MS and the RS can acquire synchronization. The BS also allocates<br>
ranging channels at the start of the first area 621 and the end of the second area 623,<br>
for ranging from MSs. The positions of the ranging channels (or ranging slots) in the<br>
UL subframe 620 may be indicated by a control channel rather than they are fixed.<br>
To facilitate synchronization and cell search, the BS provides the MS with a syn-<br>
chronization channel (referred to as BS synchronization channel) in the form of a<br>
preamble and the RS with a synchronization channel (referred to as RS syn-<br>
chronization channel) in the form of a postamble. As the synchronization channels<br>
reside at the start and end of the DL subframe 610, the MS and the RS can acquire syn-<br>
chronization information and neighbor BS information from the fixed synchronization<br>
channels. The RS synchronization channel can further be used for interference<br>
measurement.<br>
Multiple communications take place among the BS, RS1, RS2 and MSs in the multi-<br>
hop relay BWA communication system.<br>
Since the BS and RS2 provide a service to the MSs within the service area of the BS,<br><br>
they use orthogonal resources to avoid interference between two links, i.e. a BS-MS<br>
link and an R.S2-MS link. When a plurality of RS2's exist in the cell, the orthogonal<br>
resources allocated to the RS2 can be reused among them by spatial multiplexing.<br>
Therefore, the BS-MS link signal is distinguished from the RS2-MS link signal in the<br>
frequency domain, but they overlap each other in the time domain. When the BS and<br>
RS2 communicate with the MSs at the same time, near-far interference occurs.<br>
In this context, the same time resources are not allocated to the BS-MS link and the<br>
RS2-MS link as illustrated in FIG. 7. Specifically, the BWA communication system<br>
allocates predetermined resources of the second areas 613 and 623 to the RS2-MS link.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a frame structure in the multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system according to the present invention. According to the frame structure, a frame is<br>
so configured that resources are allocated to the RS1 and the RS2 in frequency<br>
division.<br>
In FIG. 7, each frame is composed of a DL subframe 720 and a UL subframe 730.<br>
The DL subframe 720 includes a time-multiplexed first and second areas 721 and 723,<br>
and the UL subframe 730 includes time-multiplexed first and second areas 731 and<br>
733. The lengths of the first areas 721 and 731 and the lengths of the second areas 723<br>
and 733 are fixed or dynamically vary depending on a cell environment.<br>
In an RS2 frame 710, the RS2 communicates with the BS in the first areas 721 and<br>
731 and communicates with an MS in predetermined parts 711 and 713 of the second<br>
areas 723 and 733. If a plurality of RS2's exist, the second areas 723 and 733 are<br>
reused among them by spatial division multiplexing. The RS1 provides a transparent<br>
relay service to an MS in the first areas 721 and 731 and communicates with the BS in<br>
the second areas 723 and 733.<br>
When a frame is configured by the spatial multiplexing and the time multiplexing as<br>
described above, the transmission and reception of the BS, RSI, RS2, and the MSs are<br>
in the relationship illustrated in FTG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating the transmission and reception timings of signals in<br>
accordance with the frame structure illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
In FIG. 8, in the DL subframe 720, a BS 800 sends a synchronization channel, a<br>
control channel, and a traffic burst to an RS2 820 or an MS 830 connected to the BS<br>
800 via a direct link in the first area 721 and then sends a control channel, a traffic<br>
burst, and a synchronization channel to an RS1 810 in the second area 723. The BS<br>
800 provides the MS 830 and the RSs 810 and 820 with a BS synchronization channel<br>
and an RS synchronization channel at the start of the first area 721 and at the end of the<br>
second area 723, respectively.<br>
The RS1 810 sends a synchronization channel, a control channel, and a traffic burst<br>
to the RS2 820 or the MS 830 connected to the RS1 810 via a relay link in the first area<br><br>
721. Then, the RS1 810 receives the synchronization channel, the control channel, and<br>
the traffic burst from the BS 800 in the second area 723.<br>
The RS2 820 receives the control channel and the traffic burst needed for the relay<br>
service from the BS 800 in the first area 721. Then, the RS2 820 sends the traffic burst<br>
to the MS 830 connected to the RS2 via a relay link in the predetermined part 711 of<br>
the second area 723.<br>
The MS 830 receives the synchronization channel, the control channel, and the traffic<br>
burst from the BS 800 or the RS1 810 in the first area 721. Then, the MS 830 receives<br>
a signal from the RS1 810 or the RS2 820 in the second area 723. Particularly, the MS<br>
830 receives the traffic burst from RS2 820 in the part of the second area 723.<br>
To avoid near-far interference, the second areas 723 and 733 are allocated to a<br>
RS2-MS link and a BS-RS1 link by frequency division. In another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the second areas 723 and 733 are allocated to the RS2-MS link and<br>
the BS-RS1 link by time division.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a frame structure in the multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system according to the present invention. A BS frame 700 and an RS2 frame 710 are<br>
shown.<br>
In FIG. 9, each of the frames 700 and 710 is composed of the DL subframe 720 and<br>
the UL subframe 730. The DL subframe 720 includes the time-multiplexed first and<br>
second areas 721 and 723, and the UL subframe 730 includes the time-multiplexed<br>
first and second areas 731 and 733. The second areas 723 and 733 are divided into the<br>
RS2-MS areas 900 and 920 and BS-RS1 areas 910 and 930. The BS provides the RS1 with an RS synchronization channel taking the form of a postamble at a fixed position.<br>
Therefore, the RS2-MS areas 900 and 920 precede the BS-RS1 areas 910 and 930 in<br>
the second areas 723 and 733.<br>
The BS communicates with the RS2 or an MS in the first areas 721 and 731 and<br>
communicates with RS1 in the second areas 723 and 733. Notably, the BS leaves the<br>
RS2-MS areas 900 and 920 empty in the second areas 723 and 733 to avoid intra-cell<br>
interference. Accordingly, the BS communicates with RS1 in the BS-RS1 areas 910<br>
and 930.<br>
For RSI, the BS provides the RS synchronization channel and a ranging channel at<br>
the ends of the BS-RS1 areas 910 and 930.<br>
In the RS frame 710, RS2 communicates with the BS in the first areas 721 and 731<br>
and then communicates with an MS in the RS2-MS areas 900 and 920 of the second<br>
areas 723 and 733. Notably, the RS2 docs not use the BS-RS1 areas 910 and 930 to<br>
avoid the intra-cell interference.<br>
The above description has been made in the context of a two-hop multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system. The BWA communication system may be configured so<br><br>
that an MS communicates with a BS over multiple hops, as illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a configuration of the multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 10, a BS 1001 communicates with an MS 1019 via relay links established by<br>
a plurality of RSs 1011, 1013, 1015, and 1017.<br>
The RSs 1011, 1013, 1015 and 1017 can be grouped into a 1st group and a 2nd group.<br>
For example, if the BS 1001 is set as a 0-hop RS, the 1st group is an even-hop group<br>
including the BS 1001, a 2-hop RS 1013, a 4-hop RS, and other even-hop RSs and the<br>
2nd group is an odd-hop group including a 1-hop RS 1011, a 3-hop RS 1015, and other<br>
odd-hop RSs.<br>
If the BS 1001 is not classified as the 0-hop RS, the 1st group is an odd-hop group<br>
including the 1-hop RS 1011, the 3-hop RS 1015, and other odd-hop RSs and the 2nd<br>
group is an even-hop group including the 2-hop RS 1013, the 4-hop RS, and the other<br>
even-hop RSs.<br>
When the multi-hop links are grouped into the first and second groups in this way,<br>
communications are carried out in frames having the configurations illustrated in FIGs.<br>
11 to 16 in the BWA communication system. The following description is made on the<br>
assumption that the 1st group is the odd-hop group and the second area illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6 is further divided into second and third areas.<br>
A DL subframe has the configuration illustrated in FIG. 11 or FIG. 13 in the BWA<br>
communication system.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a DL subframe structure in the multi-hop relay BWA com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, each DL subframe 1100 includes a time-multiplexed first,<br>
second, and third areas 1101, 1103, and 1105, respectively.<br>
In a BS subframe 1110, the BS sends the downlink subframes to an MS within its<br>
service area in the first and second areas 1101 and 1103. To avoid interference<br>
between the MS and an RS, null data can be filled in the second area 1103, instead of<br>
the downlink subframe. The BS provides the MS with a preamble as a synchronization<br>
channel at the start of the first area 1101. The BS sends a downlink subframe to a<br>
1-hop RS of the 1st group in the third area 1105. The BS provides the 1-hop RS with a<br>
postamble as a synchronization channel at the end of the third area 1105.<br>
In a 1st group RS subframe 1120, a 1st group RS sends a downlink subframe to an MS<br>
within its service area in the first area 1101. The 1st group RS provides the MS with a<br>
synchronization channel in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1101.<br>
The 1st group RS sends a downlink subframe to a next-hop RS of the 2   group in the<br>
second area 1103. The 1st group RS provides the next-hop RS with a synchronization<br>
channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the second area 1103. The 1st group<br><br>
RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 2nd group in the third<br>
area 1105. If the 1st group RS is the 1-hop RS, the 1st group RS receives the downlink<br>
subframe from the BS in the third area 1105. A TTG is interposed between the second<br>
area 1103 and the third area 1105, for an operation transition of the 1st group RS.<br>
Hence, the 1st group RS sends the synchronization channel to the 2nd group RS using<br>
resources of the second area 1103 before the TTG.<br>
In a 2nd group RS subframe 1130, a 2nd group RS sends a downlink subframe to an<br>
MS within its service area in the first area 1101. The 2nd group RS provides the MS<br>
with a synchronization channel in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area<br>
1101. The 2nd group RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 1<br>
st group in the second area 1103. The 2nd group RS sends a downlink subframe to a<br>
next-hop RS of the 1st group in the third area 1105. The 2nd group RS provides the<br>
next-hop RS with a synchronization channel in the form of a postamble at the end of<br>
the third area 1105. For operation transitions of the 2nd group RS, a TTG is interposed<br>
between the first area 1101 and the second area and an RTG intervenes between the<br>
second area 1103 and the third area 1105.<br>
While not shown, if the 1st group RS is a last-hop RS, the 1st group RS sends the<br>
downlink subframes to the MSs within its service area in the first and second areas<br>
1101 and 1103. To avoid interference between the MSs and the RS, the second area<br>
1103 may have null data. Then, the last-hop RS receives a downlink subframe from a<br>
previous-hop RS of the 2nd group in the third area 1105.<br>
If the last-hop RS is a 2nd group RS, the 1st group RS sends the downlink subframes<br>
to the MSs within its service area in the first and third areas 1101 and 1105. To avoid<br>
interference between the MSs and the RS, the third area 1105 may have null data. The<br>
last-hop RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 1st group in<br>
the second area 1103.<br>
In accordance with the DL frame structure illustrated in FIG. 11, the subframes of the<br>
first, second, and third areas of the DL subframe can be configured in compliance with<br>
IEEE 802.16 standards, as illustrated in FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates the positions of synchronization channels in the DL subframe il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 11 in the multi-hop relay BWA communication system according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 12, a DL subframe 1200 includes time-multiplexed first, second, and third<br>
areas 1201, 1203, and 1205, respectively.<br>
A BS subframe 1210 carries a synchronization channel, a control channel, and a DL<br>
burst to an MS within the service area of the BS. The BS positions the synchronization<br>
channel for the MS in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1201. If the<br>
BS uses the second area 1203, the BS frame 1210 includes a DL burst in the second<br><br>
area 1203. The third area 1205 has a control channel, a DL burst, and a syn-<br>
chronization channel for the 1-hop RS. Thus, the BS provides the 1-hop RS with the<br>
synchronization channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the third area 1205.<br>
In a 1st group RS subframe 1220, the first area 1201 carries a synchronization<br>
channel, a control channel, and a DL burst to an MS within the service area of the Ist<br>
group RS. The 1st group RS provides the MS with the synchronization channel in the<br>
form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1201. The second area 1203 has a<br>
control channel, a DL burst, and a synchronization channel for the next-hop RS of the<br>
2nd group. Thus, the 1st group RS provides the next-hop RS with the synchronization<br>
channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the second area 1203. The 1st group<br>
RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS or the BS in the third area<br>
1205.<br>
In a 2" group RS frame 1230, the first area 1201 includes a synchronization channel,<br>
a control channel, and a DL burst for an MS within the service area of the 2° group<br>
RS. That is, the 2nd group RS provides the synchronization channel for the MS in the<br>
form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1201. The third area 1205 carries a syn-<br>
chronization channel, a control channel, and a DL burst for a next-hop RS of the 1st<br>
group. That is, the 2n group RS provides the next-hop 1st group RS with a syn-<br>
chronization channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the third area 1205. The 2<br>
group RS receive a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS in the second area<br>
1203.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates a DL subframe structure in the multi-hop relay BWA com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 13, each DL subframe 1300 includes a time-multiplexed first, second, and<br>
third areas 1301, 1303, and 1305.<br>
In a BS subframe 1310, the BS sends the downlink subframes to the MSs within its<br>
service area in the first and third areas 1301 and 1305. To avoid interference between<br>
the MSs and an RS, null data can be filled in the third area 1305, instead of the<br>
downlink subframe. The BS provides a preamble as a synchronization channel at the<br>
start of the first area 1301, for the MSs. The BS sends a downlink subframe to a 1-hop<br>
RS of the 1st group in the second area 1303. The BS provides the 1-hop RS with a<br>
postamble as a synchronization channel at the end of the second area 1303. Since an<br>
RTG exists between the second area 1303 and the third area 1305 in a 1st group RS<br>
subframe 1320, the BS sends the synchronization channel to the 1-hop RS before the<br>
RTG in the second area 1303.<br>
In the 1st group RS subframe 1320, a 1st group RS sends a downlink subframe to an<br>
MS within its service area in the first area 1301. The 1st group RS provides the MS<br>
with a synchronization channel in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area<br><br>
1301. The 1st group RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 2<br>
nd group in the second area 1303. If the 1st group RS is the 1-hop RS, the 1st group RS<br>
receives the downlink subframe from the BS in the second area 1303. The 1st group RS<br>
sends a downlink subframe to a next-hop RS of the 2nd group in the third area 1305.<br>
The 1st group RS provides the next-hop RS with a synchronization channel in the form<br>
of a postamble at the end of the third area 1305. For operation transitions of the 1st<br>
group RS, a TTG is interposed between the first area 1301 and the second area 1303<br>
and an RTG exists between the second area 1303 and the third area 1305 in the 1st<br>
group RS subframe 1320.<br>
In a 2nd group RS subframe 1330, a 2nd group RS sends a downlink subframe to an<br>
MS within its service area in the first area 1301. The 2nd group RS provides the MS<br>
with a synchronization channel in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area<br>
1301. The 2nd group RS sends a downlink subframe to a next-hop RS of the 1st group in<br>
the second area 1303. The 2nd group RS provides the next-hop RS with a syn-<br>
chronization channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the second area 1303.<br>
The 2   group RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 1st<br>
group in the third area 1305.<br>
While not shown, if a last-hop RS belongs to the 1st group, the last-hop RS sends the<br>
downlink subframes to the MSs within its service area in the first and third areas 1301<br>
and 1305. To avoid interference between the MSs and the RS, the third area 1305 may<br>
have null data. The last-hop RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS<br>
of the 2nd group in the second area 1303.<br>
If the last-hop RS is a 2nd group RS, the last-hop RS sends the downlink subframes to<br>
the MSs within its service area in the first and second areas 1301 and 1303. To avoid<br>
interference between the MSs and the RS, the second area 1303 may have null data.<br>
The last-hop RS receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS of the 1st group<br>
in the third area 1305.<br>
In accordance with the DL frame structure illustrated in FIG. 13, the subframes of the<br>
first, second and third areas in the DL subframe can configured in compliance with<br>
IEEE 802.16 standards, as illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates the positions of synchronization channels in the DL subframe il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 13 in the multi-hop relay BWA communication system according to<br>
the present invention<br>
In FIG. 14, a DL subframe 1400 includes a time-multiplexed first, second, and third<br>
areas 1401, 1403, and 1405.<br>
A BS subframe 1410 carries a synchronization channel, a control channel, and a DL<br>
burst to an MS within the service area of the BS. That is, the BS positions the syn-<br>
chronization channel for the MS in the form of a preamble at the start of the first area<br><br>
1401. If the BS uses the third area 1405, the BS subframe 1410 includes a downlink<br>
burst in the third area 1405. The second area 1403 of the BS subframe 1410 has a<br>
control channel, a DL burst, and a synchronization channel for the 1-hop RS. Thus, the<br>
BS provides the 1-hop RS with the synchronization channel in the form of a postamble<br>
at the end of the second area 1403.<br>
In a 1st group RS subframe 1420, the first area 1401 carries a synchronization<br>
channel, a control channel, and a DL burst to an MS within the service area of the 1st<br>
group RS. The 1st group RS provides the MS with the synchronization channel in the<br>
form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1401. The third area 1405 has a control<br>
channel, a DL burst, and a synchronization channel for the next-hop RS of the 2nd<br>
group. Thus, the 1st group RS provides the next-hop RS with the synchronization<br>
channel in the form of a postamble at the end of the third area 1405. The 1st group RS<br>
receives a downlink subframe from a previous-hop RS or the BS in the second area<br>
1403.<br>
In a 2   group RS subframe 1430, the first area 1401 includes a synchronization<br>
channel, a control channel, and a DL burst for an MS within the service area of the 2<br>

the form of a preamble at the start of the first area 1401. The second area 1403 carries<br>
a synchronization channel, a control channel, and a DL burst for a next-hop RS of the 1<br>
st group. The 2nd group RS provides the synchronization channel to the next-hop 1st<br>
group RS in the form of a postamble at the end of the second area 1403. The 2nd group<br>

In a BS subframe 1510, the BS receives the uplink subframes from the MSs within<br>
its service area in the first and second areas 1501 and 1503. To avoid interference<br>
between the MSs and an RS, null data can be filled in the second area 1503, instead of<br>
the uplink subframe. The BS receives an uplink subframe from a 1-hop RS of the 1st<br>
group in the third area 1505.<br>
In 1st group RS subframes 1520 and 1540, a 1st group RS receives an uplink subframe<br>
from an MS within its service area in the first area 1501. The 1st group RS receives an<br>
uplink subframe from a next-hop RS of the 2nd group in the second area 1503. For<br>
example, a 1-hop RS of the first group receives an uplink subframe from a 2-hop RS of<br>
the second group. A 3-hop RS of the first group receives an uplink subframe from a<br><br>
4-hop RS of the second group. The 1st group RS sends an uplink subframe to a<br>
previous-hop RS of the second group in the third area 1505. If the 1st group RS is the<br>
1-hop RS, (he 1st group RS sends an uplink subframe to the BS in the third area 1505.<br>
For an operation transition of the 1st group RS, an RTG is interposed between the<br>
second area 1503 and the third area 1505.<br>
In a 2nd group RS frame 1530, a 2nd group RS receives an uplink subframe from an<br>
MS within its service area in the first area 1501. The 2° group RS sends an uplink<br>
subframe to a previous-hop RS of the 1st group in the second area 1503. The 2n group<br>
ELS receives an uplink subframe from a next-hop RS of the 1st group in the third area<br>
1505. For operation transitions of the 2nd group RS, an RTG exists between the first<br>
area 1501 and the second area 1503 and a TTG is interposed between the second area<br>
1503 and the third area 1505.<br>
While not shown, if a last-hop RS belongs to the first group, the last-hop RS receives<br>
the uplink subframes from the MSs within its service area in the first and second areas<br>
1501 and 1503. To avoid interference between the MSs and the RS, the second area<br>
1503 may have null data. The last-hop RS sends an uplink subframe to a previous-hop<br>
RS of the 2nd group in the third area 1505.<br>
If the last-hop RS is a T group RS, it receives uplink subframes from the MSs<br>
within its service area in the first and third areas 1501 and 1505. To avoid interference<br>
between the MSs and the RS, the third area 1505 may have null data. The last-hop RS<br>
sends an uplink subframe to a previous-hop RS of the 1st group in the second area<br>
1503.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a UL subframe structure in the multi-hop relay BWA com-<br>
munication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 16, each UL subframe 1600 includes a time-multiplexed first, second, and<br>
third areas 1601,1603 and 1605.<br>
In a BS subframe 1610, the BS receives the uplink subframes from the MSs within<br>
its service area in the first and third areas 1601 and 1605. To avoid interference<br>
between an MS and an RS, null data can be filled in the third area 1605, instead of the<br>
UL subframe. The BS receives an uplink subframe from a 1-hop RS of the 1st group in<br>
the second area 1603.<br>
In 1st group RS subframes 1620 and 1640, a 1st group RS receives an uplink subframe<br>
from an MS within its service area in the first area 1601. The 1st group RS sends an<br>
uplink subframe to a previous-hop RS of the second group in the second area 1603. If<br>
the 1st group RS is a 1-hop RS, the 1st group RS sends an uplink subframe to the BS in<br>
the second area 1603. In the third area 1605, the 1st group RS receives an uplink<br>
subframe from a next-hop RS of the 2nd group. For operation transitions of the 1st group<br>
RS, an RTG is interposed between the first area 1601 and the second area 1603 and a<br><br>
TTG exists between the second area 1603 and the third area 1605.<br>
In a 2nd group RS frame 1630, a 2nd group RS receives an uplink subframe from an<br>
MS within its service area in the first area 1601. The 2nd group RS receives an uplink<br>
subframe from a next-hop RS of the 1st group in the second area 1603 and sends an<br>

While not shown, if a last-hop RS belongs to the first group, the last-hop RS receives<br>
the uplink subframes from the MSs within its service area in the first and third areas<br>
1601 and 1605. To avoid interference between the MSs and the RS, the third area 1605<br>
may have null data. The last-hop RS sends an uplink subframe to a previous-hop RS of<br>
the 2nd group in the second area 1603.<br>
If the last-hop RS is a 2nd group RS, the last-hop RS receives the uplink subframes<br>
from the MSs within its service area in the first and second areas 1601 and 1603. To<br>
avoid interference between the MSs and the RS, the second area 1603 may have null<br>
data. The last-hop RS sends an uplink subframe to a previous-hop RS of the 1st group<br>
in the third area 1605.<br>
The BWA communication system may configure a frame by combining the DL<br>
subframe illustrated in FIG. 11 and the UL subframe illustrated in FIG. 15 or FIG. 16.<br>
On the other hand, the BWA communication system may configure a frame by<br>
combining the DL subframe illustrated in FIG. 13 and the UL subframe illustrated in<br>
FIG. 15 or FIG. 16.<br>
As described above, the BS sends a synchronization channel to the MSs and the<br>
1-hop RSs according to a frame configuration in the BWA communication system. The<br>
1st group RSs send synchronization channels to the MSs and the 2nd group RSs<br>
according to the frame configuration. The 2nd group RSs provide synchronization<br>
channels to the MSs and the next-hop RSs of the first group according to the frame<br>
configuration.<br>
The BS, the 1st group RSs, and the 2nd group RSs send the synchronization channels<br>
in every frame or in every predetermined number of frames. Alternatively, they may<br>
include the synchronization channels in frames indicated by a control signal. The<br>
control signal contains a Frame Control Header (FCH), a MAP, and a Downlink<br>
Channel Descriptor (DCD).<br>
Now a description will be made of operations of the BS, RS1, RS2, and the MS to<br>
communicate using the frame configurations described above in the BWA com-<br>
munication system.<br>
FIG. 17 is a flow diagram illustrating a process of the BS in the multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 17, the BS defines a direct-link area and a relay-link area in each of the DL<br>
and UL subframes in step 1701. For example, if the BWA communication system<br><br>
spans two hops, a first area for the direct link and a second area for the relay link are<br>
defined in each of the DL and UL subframes. If the BWA communication system<br>
spans three hops, a first area for the direct link and second and third areas for the relay<br>
link are defined in each of the DL and UL subframes.<br>
In step 1703, the BS communicates with an MS and RS2 within its service area in the<br>
direct-link area. The BS provides a BS synchronization channel to the MS at the start<br>
of the direct-link area. For example, if a frame has the configuration illustrated in FIG.<br>
6, FIG. 7, or FIG. 9, the BS communicates with the MS in the first areas.<br>
If the DL subframe and the UL subframe have the configurations illustrated in FIG.<br>
11 and FIG. 15, respectively, the BS communicates with the MS in the first areas or<br>
the second areas. If the DL subframe and the UL subframe have the configurations il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 13 and FIG. 16, respectively, the BS communicates with the MS in<br>
the first areas or the third areas.<br>
The BS communicates with a 1-hop RS in the relay-link area in step 1705. For the<br>
1-hop RS, the BS provides an RS synchronization channel at the end of the relay-link<br>
area.<br>
For example, if the frame has the configuration illustrated in FIG. 6, FIG. 7 or FIG.<br>
9, the BS communicates with the 1-hop RS in the second areas. Thus, the BS provides<br>
the synchronization channel to the 1-hop RS at the end of the second area of the DL<br>
subframe.<br>
If the DL subframe and the UL subframe have the configurations illustrated in FIG.<br>
11 and FIG. 15, respectively, the BS communicates with the 1-hop RS in the third<br>
areas. Thus, the BS provides the synchronization channel to the 1-hop RS at the end of<br>
the third area of the DL subframe.<br>
If the DL subframe and the UL subframe have the configurations illustrated in FIG.<br>
13 and FIG. 16, respectively, the BS communicates with the 1-hop RS in the second<br>
areas. Thus, the BS provides the synchronization channel to the 1-hop RS at the end of<br>
the second area of the DL subframe.<br>
Then, the BS ends the process.<br>
FIG. 18 is a flow diagram illustrating a process of the RS1 in the multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 18, the RS1 checks the subframe configuration information, i.e. configuration<br>
information about direct-link areas and relay-link areas in the DL and UL subframes<br>
received from the BS or an upper RS in step 1801. If a frame has the configuration il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 6, FIG. 7, or FIG. 9, the RS1 checks the configuration information<br>
concerning the first and second areas.<br>
If a DL subframe has the configuration illustrated in FIG. 11 or FIG. 13 and a UL<br>
subframe has the configuration illustrated in FIG. 15 or FIG. 16, the RS1 checks con-<br><br>
figuration information about the first, second, and third areas.<br>
In step 1803, the RS1 communicates with an MS or a RS2 within its service area in<br>
the first areas for the direct link. For the MS, the RS1 provides a synchronization<br>
channel at the start of the first area in the DL subframe.<br>
The RS1 communicates with the BS or multi-hop RSs in the relay-link areas in step<br>
1805. For the lower RSs, RS1 provide a synchronization channel at the end of an area<br>
for communicating with the lower RSs in the DL subframe. If the frame has the con-<br>
figuration illustrated in FIG. 6, FIG. 7, or FIG. 9, RS1 communicates with the BS in<br>
the second areas.<br>
If the DL subframe and the UL subframe of the frame have the configurations il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 11 and FIG. 15, respectively, the RS1 communicates with the lower<br>
RSs in the second areas and communicates with the BS or the upper RSs in the third<br>
areas. The RS1 provides the synchronization channel to the lower RSs at the end of the<br>
second area in the DL subframe.<br>
If the DL subframe and the UL subframe of the frame have the configurations il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 13 and FIG. 16, respectively, the RS1 communicates with the lower<br>
RSs in the third areas and communicates with the BS or the upper RSs in the second<br>
areas. The RS1 provides the synchronization channel for the lower RSs at the end of<br>
the third area in the DL subframe.<br>
Then the RS1 ends the process.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flow diagram illustrating an operation of the RS2 in the multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 19, the RS2 checks the control information and the subframe configuration<br>
information formed according to its relay capability, received from the BS in step<br>
1901. For example, if a frame is configured as illustrated in FIG. 7 or FIG. 9, the RS2<br>
checks the information tconcerning the first and second areas and the RS2-MS link<br>
areas of the second areas.<br>
In step 1903, the RS2 communicates with the BS in the first area. The RS2 then com-<br>
municates with an MS that receives a relay service via the RS2 in the second area in<br>
step 1905.<br>
For example, the RS2 receives a signal from the BS in the first area and sends a<br>
signal to the MS in the second area of a DL subframe. In a UL subframe, the RS2<br>
sends a signal to the BS in the first area and receives a signal from the MS in the<br>
second area.<br>
Then the RS2 ends the process.<br>
FIG. 20 is a flow diagram illustrating an operation of the MS in the multi-hop relay<br>
BWA communication system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 20, the MS communicates with the BS or the RS1 in the first area in step<br><br>
2001.<br>
In step 2003, the MS communicates with RS2 in the second area. For example, in a<br>
DL subframe, the MS receives a signal from the BS or RS1 in the first area and<br>
receives a signal from the RS2 in the second area. In a UL subframe, the MS sends a<br>
signal to the BS or RS1 in the first area and a signal to the RS2 in the second area.<br>
Then the MS ends the process.<br>
It has been described above that each single-directional subframe is divided into the<br>
first and second areas or the first, second, and third areas which are time-<br>
division-multiplexed in a TDD system. In another exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the single-directional subframe is divided into first and second areas<br>
or first, second, and third areas which are frequency-division-multiplexed in a<br>
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system. In the FDD system, the DL subframe and<br>
the UL subframe are sent/received simultaneously in different frequency bands.<br>
A description will now be made of the structures of the BS and an RS for providing a<br>
relay service in the BWA communication system. Because the BS and the RS have the<br>
same configuration, their structures will be described, taking a BS configuration il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 21. The following description is made with the appreciation that<br>
signal transmission and reception are carried out using a single transceiver in the BS<br>
and the RS.<br>
FIG. 21 is a block diagram of the BS in the multi-hop relay BWA communication<br>
system according to the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 21, the BS includes a transmitter 2101, a receiver 2103, a timing controller<br>
2105, and an RF switch 2107.<br>
The transmitter 2101 has a frame generator 2109, a resource mapper 2111, a<br>
modulator 2113, and a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) 2115.<br>
In operation, the frame generator 2109 configures a DL subframe to send syn-<br>
chronization channels, control channels, and traffic bursts to an MS and a lower RS<br>
within the service area of the BS under the timing controller 2105. Notably, the frame<br>
generator 2109 provides a synchronization channel for the MS at the start of a<br>
subframe for the MS and a synchronization channel for the lower RS at the end of a<br>
subframe for the lower RS in the DL subframe.<br>
If the BWA communication system spans two hops, the frame generator 2109<br>
configures a subframe to be sent to the MS or the RS2 in a first area of the DL<br>
subframe. Then the frame generator 2109 configures a subframe to be sent to a 1-hop<br>
RS in a second area of the DL subframe. The frame generator 2109 positions the syn-<br>
chronization channels at the start of the subframe in the first area and at the end of the<br>
subframe in the second area.<br>
If the BWA communication system spans three or more hops, the frame generator<br><br>
2109 configures a subframe to be sent to the MS or RS2 in a first area or first and<br>
second areas of the DL subframe. Then, the frame generator 2109 configures a<br>
subframe to be sent to the 1-hop RS in a third area of the DL subframe. The frame<br>
generator 2109 positions the synchronization channels at the start of the subframe in<br>
the first area and at the end of the subframe in the third area.<br>
The resource mapper 2111 maps the subframes received from the frame generator<br>
2109 to bursts for links corresponding to the subframes.<br>
The modulator 2113 modulates the mapped subframes in a predetermined<br>
modulation scheme.<br>
The DAC 2115 converts the modulated digital signal to an analog signal and<br>
provides the analog signal to the RF switch 2107.<br>
The receiver 2103 includes an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) 2117, a de-<br>
modulator 2119, a resource demapper 2121, and a frame extractor 2123.<br>
The ADC 2117 converts an analog signal received through the RF switch 2107 to a<br>
digital signal. The demodulator 2119 demodulates the digital signal in a predetermined<br>
demodulation scheme.<br>
The resource demapper 2121 extracts subframes from link bursts received from the<br>
demodulator. The frame extractor 2123 extracts a subframe destined for the BS from<br>
the subframes.<br>
The RF switch 2107 switches signals to be sent to or received from the MS, RSI, and<br>
RS2 to the transmitter 2101 and the receiver 2103 under the control of the timing<br>
controller 2105.<br>
The timing controller 2105 controls transmission and reception timings at which the<br>
BS communicates with the MS and the lower RS according to a frame configuration.<br>
The configuration of the RS1 will be described with reference to FIG. 21.<br>
In FIG. 21, the RS1 includes the transmitter 2101, the receiver 2103, the timing<br>
controller 2105, and the RF switch 2107.<br>
The transmitter 2101 has the frame generator 2109, the resource mapper 2111, the<br>
modulator 2113, and the DAC 2115.<br>
In operation, the frame generator 2109 configures a DL subframe to send syn-<br>
chronization channels, control channels, and traffic bursts to an MS and a lower RS<br>
within the service area of the RS1 under the timing controller 2105. Notably, the frame<br>
generator 2109 provides a synchronization channel for the MS at the start of a<br>
subframe for the MS and a synchronization channel for the lower RS at the end of a<br>
subframe for the lower RS in the DL subframe.<br>
The frame generator 2109 also generates a UL subframe in which to communicate<br>
with the BS or an upper RS.<br>
The resource mapper 2111 maps the subframes received from the frame generator<br><br>
2109 to bursts for links corresponding to the subframes.<br>
The modulator 2113 modulates the mapped subframes in a predetermined<br>
modulation scheme.<br>
The DAC 2115 converts the modulated digital signal to an analog signal and<br>
provides the analog signal to the RF switch 2107.<br>
The receiver 2103 includes the ADC 2117, the demodulator 2119, the resource<br>
demapper 2121, and the frame extractor 2123.<br>
The ADC 2117 converts an analog signal received through the RF switch 2107 to a<br>
digital signal. The demodulator 2119 demodulates the digital signal in a predetermined<br>
demodulation scheme.<br>
The resource demapper 2121 extracts subframes from link bursts received from the<br>
demodulator. The frame extractor 2123 extracts a subframe destined for the BS from<br>
the subframes.<br>
The RF switch 2107 switches signals to be sent to or received from the BS, the MS,<br>
the lower RS, and the upper RS to the transmitter 2101 and the receiver 2103 under the<br>
control of the timing controller 2105.<br>
The timing controller 2105 controls transmission and reception timings at which the<br>
RS1 communicates with the BS, the MS, the lower RS, and the upper RS according to<br>
a frame configuration.<br>
As described above, the multi-hop relay BWA communication system provides syn-<br>
chronization channels to the MSs and the RSs. Therefore, the RSs facilitate syn-<br>
chronization and cell search. Also, time multiplexing between a relay service and a<br>
direct service within a cell eliminates near-far interference between them.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred<br>
