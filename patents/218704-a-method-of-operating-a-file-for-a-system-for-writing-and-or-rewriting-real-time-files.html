				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of operating a<br>
file for a system for writing and/or rewriting real time<br>
files, a recording and/or reproducing method, a system<br>
requiring recording and/or reproduction in real time, and<br>
also to a recording medium for storing real time<br>
recording/reproduction information, and in particular, to a<br>
method and apparatus for recording and reproducing a real<br>
time file based on the real time recording/reproduction<br>
information, This application has been divided out of Indian<br>
Patent Application No.406CAL99.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In a computer or audio and/or video (A/V) apparatus<br>
constituted of a file system for an A/V file required to be<br>
recorded/reproduced in real time, control information<br>
representing that the A/V file is a real time recording/<br>
reproduction file is not recorded in file control<br>
information. Thus, it is impossible to reproduce in real time<br>
a file comprised of data blocks physically scattered on a<br>
recording medium even if they are logically successive.<br>
Here, a conventional file system is comprised of file<br>
control information having the length of a file, information<br>
on the position of file data, information on the possibility<br>
or impossibility of reading/writing a file, etc., and file<br>
data stored in positions designated by the file control<br>
information. When a file on a disc is read, file control<br>
information is first read, and file data in the positions<br>
designated by the read file control information is then read<br>
and reproduced. Such a method of allocating a block of a<br>
fixed size used in the conventional file system cannot<br>
guarantee real time reproduction of a file.<br>
In the conventional file system, since information<br>
associated with real time recording/reproduction is not<br>
recorded even when recording a file requiring real time<br>
recording/reproduction, a data arrangement for real time<br>
recording/reproduction is not considered. Thus, real time<br>
reproduction may not be achieved.<br>
That is, a file (for example, a video file) requires<br>
real time reproduction, but the conventional file system<br>
arranges data files without consideration of the requirement<br>
of real time reproduction, thus causing a screen to be<br>
interrupted during playback. In order to record/reproduce<br>
files in real time, the sum of a seek time and a read time<br>
must be smaller than a playback time, as shown in the<br>
following expression :<br>
seek time + read time 
In order to prevent a screen from being interrupted, a<br>
next block must be searched for during reading and<br>
reproducing a current block before the next block is read.<br>
However, in an apparatus for driving a disc such as a compact<br>
disc (CD) and a digital versatile disc (DVD), the seek time<br>
is significantly longer than the read time. Therefore, real<br>
time reproduction is impossible if the next block is not<br>
physically adjacent to the current block.<br>

Related Art<br>
A conventional file system, as shown in Fig.l, is<br>
comprised of file control information having the length of a<br>
file, information on the position of file data, information<br>
on the possibility or impossibility of reading/writing a<br>
file, etc., and file data stored in positions designated by<br>
the file control information. When a file on a disc is read,<br>
file control information is first read, and file data in the<br>
positions designated by the read file control information is<br>
then read and reproduced. Such a method of allocating a block<br>
of a fixed size used in the conventional file system cannot<br>
guarantee real time reproduction of a file.<br>
That is, recording/reproduction of the conventional file<br>
system is described by taking as an example the case in which<br>
two files occupy blocks on a disc as shown in FIG.2. Here, a<br>
file A, requiring real time reproduction, occupies blocks<br>
0,3,5 and 6 of the disc, and a file B, a general file,<br>
occupies blocks 1, 2, 4 and 7 of the disc.<br>
The process for reproducing the file A is as follows.<br>
In the first step, block O is read;<br>
In the second step, block 3 is searched for;<br>
In the third step, block 3 is read and played back;<br>
In the fourth step, the block 5 is searched for;<br>
In the fifth step, blocks 5 and 6 are read and played<br>
back.<br>
In the conventional file system, since information<br>
associated with real time recording/reproduction is not<br>
recorded even when recording a file requiring real time<br>
recording/reproduction, a data arrangement for real time<br>
recording/reproduction is not considered. Thus, real time<br>
reproduction may not be achieved.<br>
That is, the file A (for example, a video file) requires<br>
real time reproduction, but the conventional file system<br>
arranges data files without consideration of the requirement<br>
of real time reproduction, thus causing a screen to be<br>
interrupted during playback. In order to record/reproduce<br>
files in real time, the sum of a seek time and a read time<br>
must be smaller than a playback time, as shown in the<br>
following expression :<br>
seek time + read time 
In order to prevent a screen from being interrupted, a<br>
next block must be searched for during reading and<br>
reproducing a current block before the next block is read.<br>
However, in an apparatus for driving a disc such as a compact<br>
disc (CD) and a digital versatile disc (DVD), the seek time<br>
is significantly longer than the read time. Therefore, real<br>
time reproduction is impossible if the next block is not<br>
physically adjacent to the current block.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of a recording medium for storing<br>
real time recording/reproduction information, a real time<br>
recording and reproducing method and apparatus, and a file<br>
operating method using the real time recording/reproduction<br>
information will now be described referring to the drawings.<br>
FIGS.3A through 3D show examples of storing real time<br>
recording/reproduction information (this can be called real<br>
time recording/reproduction attribute information) according<br>
to the present invention. As shown in FIG.3A, the real time<br>
recording/reproduction information can be provided as an<br>
attribute to each real time file. As an example, the real<br>
time recording/reproduction attribute information can be<br>
stored in an extended attribute field in a file entry or a<br>
stream directory ICB (information control block) field when<br>
a file system is a universal disk format (UDF) system.<br>
Alternatively, the real time recording/reproduction<br>
attribute information can be stored in a file identifier<br>
descriptor field, a file type field, or a flag field among an<br>
ICB TAG field in a file entry. The file entry can be called a<br>
file control information area or a file structure area.<br>
As shown in FIG.3B, real time recording/reproduction<br>
attribute information for each file can be stored in a<br>
predetermined area (information area) in each file. For<br>
example, in the case of a real time rewritable (RTRW) format,<br>
real time recording/reproduction attribute information can be<br>
stored in a data file named RTRW_TS.VOB.<br>
As shown in FIG.3C, real time recording/reproducing<br>
attribute information for each file can be stored in a<br>
separate file. As an example, real time recording/<br>
reproduction attribute information can be stored in an<br>
information file having an RTRW format named RTRW_TS.IFO. As<br>
another example, when the file system is the UDF system, the<br>
real time recording/reproduction attribute information can be<br>
stored in a volume structure area separate from a file<br>
structure area, as shown in FIG.3D.<br>
Therefore, when real time recording/reproduction<br>
attribute information is stored in the volume structure area<br>
or file structure area in the UDF system, the real time<br>
recording/reproduction attribute information is first<br>
interpreted upon mounting a volume or opening a file, and<br>
data is then recorded/reproduced in real time according to<br>
the interpreted information.<br>
Real time recording/reproduction file indication<br>
information (e.g.,identifier = "AV file") representing that a<br>
file requires real time recording/reproduction is included in<br>
the real time recording/reproduction attribute information.<br>
Among information on the size of the minimum contiguous<br>
storage block satifying the condition of expression 1,<br>
reproduction time information for ensuring minimum contiguous<br>
storage, recording/reproduction bit rate information, and<br>
information on the contiguous recording/reproduction type, at<br>
least one can be stored in the real time recording/<br>
reproduction attribute information. Here, if there are three<br>
types of discs A, B and C, the contiguous recording/<br>
reproduction type information can be predetermined as<br>
follows:<br>
type A = 10.08 Mbps, type B = 1.4 Mbps, type C = 8 Mbps<br>
An attribute representing whether files are currently<br>
arranged so as to be recorded/reproduced in real time, i.e.,<br>
an attribute representing the current real time recordable/<br>
reproducible state of files, is also included in the real<br>
time recording/reproduction attribute information.<br>
Real time recording/reproduction bit rate information is<br>
stored in the real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information. When the recording/reproduction bit rate is<br>
changed in each section, information associated with a<br>
plurality of bit rate values and sections (e.g., position<br>
information) can be stored in the real time recording/<br>
reproduction attribute information. The maximum allowable<br>
value of the real time recording/reproduction bit rate can be<br>
further stored in the real time recording/reproduction<br>
attribute information. Here, the control information of a<br>
spindle motor can be obtained by using the recording/<br>
reproduction bit rate information.<br>
In addition, file defect management information, file<br>
buffering information, file allocation information, etc. can<br>
be included in the real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information. That is, if file defect management information<br>
is stored in the real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information, replacement of a defective block with a spare<br>
area is not attempted when reading or writing fails, and<br>
further reading or writing of the defective block is not<br>
attempted.<br>
For example, file allocation information such as non-<br>
allocation of a defective block replaced by a spare area as a<br>
data block can be stored in the real time recording/<br>
reproduction attribute information. File buffering<br>
information associated with the amount of data to be<br>
initially read from a track buffer and the amount of data<br>
to be recorded in the track buffer at a time can also be<br>
stored as the real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information.<br>
Instead of individually storing many real time<br>
recording/reproduction attributes such as file defect<br>
management information, file allocation information, and file<br>
buffering information, the conditions for controlling real<br>
time files are classified into types, and the information of<br>
the classified types is recorded in a real time recording/<br>
reproduction file attribute information area. In this way,<br>
easy real time recording can be achieved. For example, the<br>
following types of information can be provided:<br>
type A: a data bit rate of lOMbps, impossibility of<br>
allocation of a data block to a defective block replaced by a<br>
spare area, and impossibility of reattempt of reading upon<br>
failure in reading; and<br>
type B: a data bit rate of 8Mbps, possibility of<br>
allocating a data block to a defective block replaced by a<br>
spare area, and impossibility of reattempting reading upon<br>
failure in reading.<br>
Meanwhile, referring to FIG.4 showing an example of real<br>
time files comprised of minimum contiguous storage blocks on<br>
a disc according to the present invention, a file A is a file<br>
requiring real time reproduction. If a minimum contiguous<br>
storage block satisfying the condition of expression 1 is<br>
comprised of four blocks, the file A is recorded in real time<br>
in units of four blocks. That is, the real time file A<br>
occupies blocks 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14 on<br>
a disc. A general file B occupies blocks 4, 9, 10 and 15 on<br>
the disc. The general file B not requiring real time<br>
reproduction has a minimum contiguous storage block comprised<br>
of one block, and one or an arbitrary number of segments can<br>
be stored. This block generally corresponds to a sector of a<br>
disc.<br>
The file A operates for real time reproduction, as<br>
follows.<br>
In step 1, blocks 0, 1, 2, and 3 are read.<br>
In step 2, block 5 is searched for during playback of<br>
the blocks 0, 1, 2 and 3.<br>
In step 3, blocks 5, 6, 7 and 8 are read.<br>
In step 4, block 11 is searched for during playback of<br>
the blocks 5, 6, 7 and 8.<br>
In step 5, blocks 11, 12, 13 and 14 are read and played<br>

If no areas for contiguous blocks capable of satisfying<br>
the minimum contiguous storage block exist on a disc upon<br>
storage of a file requiring real time reproduction, recording<br>
of the file is not possible. However, if a warning message<br>
like "contiguous recording is not possible. Shall the minimum<br>
contiguous storage block be designated as one block and the<br>
file be stored in the designated block length ?" is sent to a<br>
user, and if the user requires storage, the file can be<br>
stored in the minimum contiguous storage blocks comprised of<br>
one block. In this case, the value of the initially-<br>
designated minimum contiguous storage block is stored in the<br>
information associated with the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block length included in the real time recording/reproduction<br>
attributes, but information indicating that the arrangement<br>
of currently stored files makes real time recording/<br>
reproduction impossible is stored in a current real time<br>
recordable/reproducible state attribute. This is done so that<br>
a file to be copied can be contiguously treated as a real<br>
time recording/reproduction file when the file is copied on<br>
different discs or the same disc.<br>
In the present invention, a driving apparatus, such as a<br>
CD drive and a DVD drive, having a seek time (e.g.,150 ms)<br>
significantly longer than a read time (e.g., 1.43ms), which<br>
is expressed by seek time &gt;&gt; read time, can also realize real<br>
time reproduction if it satisfies the condition of expression<br>
1: seek time + read time 
Meanwhile, the minimum contiguous storage block limits<br>
the allocation of a free block on a disc to satisfy a<br>
predetermined purpose. Here, the free block means a non-used<br>
area having no defective blocks or a rewritable area among<br>
user areas that can be used by a user.<br>
If the minimum contiguous storage block is defined as 16<br>
blocks arranged in an error correction code (ECC) block, the<br>
allocation of a data block is not possible for less than 16<br>
contiguous free blocks. Also, the allocation of a data block<br>
is not possible for 16 contiguous free blocks ranging over<br>
two ECC blocks. Here, the minimum contiguous storage block<br>
has the purpose of recording and reproducing a DVD-RAM in an<br>
ECC unit.<br>
When all real time data is stored on physically-<br>
contiguous blocks on a disc, no seeking occurs, and thus<br>
recording/reproduction is prevented from being interrupted.<br>
However, since contiguous blocks do not. infinitely exist, a<br>
minimum contiguous storage block is calculated and stored as<br>
the real time recording/reproduction attributes of a file,<br>
and real time data is recorded in the minimum contiguous<br>
storage block. In this way, the interruption of a screen can<br>
be prevented.<br>
If an MPEG playback bit rate (=Vb) of 8Mbps, a seek time<br>
of 150ms, a read bit rate (=Va) of UMbps, a block of 2048<br>
bytes, and data having ECC blocks each comprised of 16 blocks<br>
is recorded in a recording medium such as a disc, the minimum<br>
contiguous storage block S can be obtained according to the<br>
condition of expression 1 as shown in the following<br>
expression 2:<br>
(1-Vb/Va) 2048 ) &gt;Vb seek time/1000 .... (2)<br>
From this expression, the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block S is 261 blocks. When data is recorded in units of at<br>
least 261 blocks designated as the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block, real time reproduction is possible. However, 272<br>
blocks corresponding to 17 contiguous ECC blocks can be<br>
o<br>
designated as the minimum contiguous storage block. Here, the<br>
predetermined purpose is to ensure recording/reproduction<br>
when the maximum seek time is 150ms.<br>
With one ECC block comprised of 16 blocks designated as<br>
the minimum contiguous storage block, and a limitation such<br>
as the seek time added as shown in expression 2, a free block<br>
allocation method for real time recording and reproduction is<br>
classified into steps, and the steps can be arranged as shown<br>
in Table 1:<br>
[Table 1]<br>
A/V data is recorded and reproduced by arranging blocks<br>
satisfying a limitation on the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block whose number of blocks depends on each step, so that<br>
the blocks can be physically connected to each other, whereby<br>
real time recording and reproduction can be ensured. For<br>
example, when there are three groups of blocks of the minimum<br>
contiguous storage block: 16 blocks, 272 blocks and 1088<br>
blocks, and the seek time is 150ms, the possibility of real<br>
time recording/reproduction depends on the method of<br>
connecting the blocks.<br>
That is, when 272 blocks, 1088 blocks, and 16 blocks are<br>
sequentially arranged, real time recording and reproduction<br>
is possible, and when 16 blocks, 272 blocks and 1088 blocks<br>
are sequentially arranged, real time recording and<br>
reproduction is not possible.<br>
Accordingly, the minimum contiguous storage block can be<br>
effectively recorded and reproduced in real time using the<br>
allocation of blocks by steps and the block connecting<br>
method.<br>
Meanwhile, if the end portion of a file is not filled<br>
with as much data as in a minimum contiguous storage block as<br>
shown in FIG.5, even when the file is recorded according to<br>
the condition of the minimum contiguous storage block, an<br>
attribute representing that data blocks for the unifilled<br>
area are allocated but not recorded is stored as real time<br>
recording/reproduction information, thus allowing real time<br>
playback upon additional recording.<br>
That is, referring to FIG.5 showing the one-dimensional<br>
structure of a recording medium in which real time AV data<br>
stored in the minimum contiguous storage block is placed,<br>
real time recording/reproduction attribute information in<br>
addition to the length of a file, information on the position<br>
of file data, information on the possibility or impossibility<br>
of reading/writing a file, etc is further stored in file<br>
control information positioned at a disk block #1. Two<br>
minimum contiguous storage blocks each comprised of 272 data<br>
blocks are allocated to first file data placed at a disk<br>
block #m. 272 data blocks for the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block are allocated to second file data positioned at a disk<br>
block #n, and 200 data blocks and 72 allocated/unrecorded<br>
blocks are allocated to third file data positioned at a disk<br>
block #0.<br>
When a file for real time recording/reproduction is<br>
copied on the same disc or different discs, the data blocks<br>
of the file must be arranged on the disc using real time<br>
recording/reproduction attribute information so that the file<br>
can be played back in real time. If the arrangement of the<br>
data blocks is not possible, the data blocks are arranged on<br>
the same basis as the arrangement basis of general file<br>
blocks. Here, the real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information maintains the original attribute information, but<br>
the impossibility of real time recording/reproduction is set<br>
as a current real time recordable/reproducible state<br>
attribute.<br>
Also, when an operating system (OS) detects defective<br>
blocks on a disc upon copying of a file, data blocks to be<br>
copied must be arranged in consideration of the original real<br>
time recording/reproduction attribute information and medium<br>
defect management information recorded in a secondary defect<br>
list (SDL). For example, when the minimum contiguous storage<br>
block is 40 blocks as shown in FIG.6A, data blocks are<br>
arranged in consideration of a defective area of a disc to<br>
copy a file on, as shown in FIG.6B. On the other hand, when<br>
the operating system OS does not detect defects recorded in<br>
the SDL, data is allocated to blocks other than the defective<br>
block area in an application program for copying and in<br>
consideration of real time recording/reproduction attribute<br>
information as shown in FIG.6B.<br>
FIG.7 is a flowchart illustrating a reproducing method<br>
using real time recording/reproduction information, according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. A disc is loaded<br>
on a player in step S101, and the player reads a volume area<br>
from the disc in step S102. A determination of whether real<br>
time recording/reproduction information exists on the volume<br>
area is made in step S103. If real time recording/<br>
reproduction information exists on the volume area, playback<br>
of files is set in consideration of the real time recording/<br>
reproduction information in step S104. If it is determined in<br>
step S103 or after step S104 that no real time recording/<br>
reproduction information exists on the volume area, reading<br>
of the volume area is completed in step S105.<br>
Thereafter, a file is read in step S106. It is<br>
determined whether real time recording/reproduction<br>
information exists in the read file, in step S107. If the<br>
real time recording/reproduction information exists in the<br>
read file, playback of the file is set in consideration of<br>
the real time recording/reproduction information, in step<br>
S108. If it is determined in step S107 or after step S108<br>
that no real time recording/reproduction information exists<br>
in the read file, the read file is played back in<br>
consideration of whether the real time recording/reproduction<br>
information has been set, in step S109.<br>
Here, when real time recording/reproduction information<br>
exists in the volume structure area, steps S107 and S108 may<br>
not be performed. Also, when real time recording/reproduction<br>
information exists in a file control information area, steps<br>
S103, S104 and S105 may not be performed.<br>
FIG.8 is a schematic block diagram of a disc recording<br>
and reproducing apparatus to be applied to the present<br>
invention. The function of the apparatus for recording and<br>
reproducing A/V data using a recordable and rewritable disc<br>
is divided into recording and reproduction.<br>
Upon recording, a codec 110 compresses and encodes an<br>
audio/video (A/V) signal from an external bitstream using a<br>
predetermined compression scheme, and writes data compressed<br>
according to a recording/reproduction bit rate (Vb) to a<br>
track buffer 120. An error correction encoder and decoder<br>
(ECC) 130 error-correct encodes the data written to the track<br>
buffer 120, reads the error-correction encoded data at a<br>
write/read bit rate Va, and applies the results to a pickup<br>
unit 140. Also, the ECC 130 applies real time<br>
recording/reproduction information generated under the<br>
control of a controller 170 to the pickup unit 140 so that<br>
the information can be recorded on a volume structure area or<br>
a file control information area. The pickup unit 140 converts<br>
the error-correction encoded data into a radio frequency (RF)<br>
signal and records the RF signal on a disc 150. Here, the<br>
recording rotating speed of a spindle motor 160 for driving<br>
the disc 150 is controlled according to a servo control<br>
signal from the controller 170.<br>
Upon reproduction, when real time recording/reproduction<br>
information is stored in the file control information area or<br>
the volume area, buffering information associated with the<br>
amount of data to be initially read from the track buffer,<br>
file allocation information, defect management information,<br>
recording/reproduction bit rate information, etc. are read in<br>
advance, and reading of file data is controlled on the basis<br>
of the read information. File data to be satisfied by the<br>
condition of the minimum contiguous storage block is read<br>
from the disc 150 at a write/read bit rate Va. The read file<br>
data is error-correction decoded by the ECC 130 via the<br>
pickup unit 140, and written to the track buffer 120. The<br>
codec 110 reads data written to the track buffer 120 at the<br>
recording/reproduction bit rate Vb, decodes the read data,<br>
and reproduces A/V data.<br>
When recording/reproducing bit rate information exists<br>
in the real time recording/reproduction information, the<br>
controller 170 obtains the control information of the spindle<br>
motor 160 from the recording/reproducing bit rate information<br>
provided from the pickup unit 140 and the ECC 130, and can<br>
drive not only the spindle motor but also a servo mechanism.<br>
FIG.9 is a view showing the flow of control for<br>
recording/reproducing data on a disc to which real time<br>
recording/reproduction attributes are provided, in a real<br>
time rewritable (RTRW) system.<br>
The RTRW system is comprised of an application layer 201<br>
for producing a command associated with A/V data recording/<br>
reproduction, a Windows kernel 202 for interpreting the<br>
produced command, and a device driver 203 having a file<br>
system the same as the file system of a DVD-RAM device driver<br>
for requesting a corresponding function according to the<br>
command interpreted by the Windows kernel 202 by transmitting<br>
a driver command to a drive 204. Here, the Windows kernel 202<br>
and the device driver 203 correspond to a file system layer,<br>
and the Windows kernel 202 can be called a kernel layer.<br>
FIG.10 is a block diagram showing the flow of real time<br>
recording/reproduction data for a computer system among RTRW<br>
systems. Upon recording, the following processes are<br>
performed in a multitasking manner storing A/V data input to<br>
an A/V encoder 211 in a computer main memory 212 in real<br>
time; storing A/V data stored in the computer main memory 212<br>
in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) file of a hard disk drive<br>
(HDD) 213; and storing the A/V data from the FIFO file of the<br>
HDD 213 in a DVD-RAM disk 214. Here, when a sufficient main<br>
memory exists on a computer, the FIFO file may not exist in<br>
the HDD.<br>
Upon reproduction, a process for storing A/V data from<br>
the DVD-RAM disk 214 in a computer main memory 215 in real<br>
time and a process for reading the A/V data stored in the<br>
main memory 215 through an A/V decoder 216 are performed in a<br>
multitasking way.<br>
For example, the function of a RTRW system using a<br>
Windows kernel is divided into creation of a file to which<br>
real time recording/reproduction attributes are provided,<br>
allocation of a data area, data recording, data reproduction,<br>
data deletion, and file closing, and these divided functions<br>
will now be described referring to FIG.9.<br>
A. <method of creating a real time recording></method>
file&gt;<br>
In the first step, a Windows kernel API (application<br>
programming interface) called to create a real time<br>
recording/reproduction file is a create file. The application<br>
layer 201 assigns a file attribute as FILE _ATTRIBUTE _RTRW<br>
to a create file to create the real time recording/<br>
reproduction file, and calls the Windows kernel 202 as in the<br>
following example;<br>
example: FileHandle = CreateFile<br>
("AVFILE.MPG",FILE_ATRIBUTE_RTRW,...)<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 orders the<br>
DVD-RAM device driver 203 to create a file.<br>
In the third step, the DVD-RAM device driver 203<br>
designates a FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RTRW attribute when the<br>
generation function is ordered. When the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RTRW<br>
attribute is designated, file control information is stored<br>
in an extended attribute area of a file entry, a stream<br>
directory ICB (information control block) area, a file<br>
identifier descriptor area, or a file type area or flag area<br>
of an ICB TAG field in a file entry. Here, bit rate<br>
information can also be set when an A/V file is created.<br>
B. <method of allocating an allocated area a></method>
real time recording/reproduction file&gt;<br>
In the first step, a Windows kernel API called to<br>
allocate an allocated/unrecorded area of a real time<br>
recording/reproduction file is a set file pointer having a<br>
seek function. In order for the application layer 201 to pre-<br>
allocate a data area of a real time recording/reproduction<br>
file in advance as an allocated/unrecorded area as large as a<br>
minimum contiguous storage block, the set file pointer calls<br>
the Windows kernel 202 as in the following example:<br>
example: SetFilePointer<br>
(FileHandle,8*1024*1024,NULL,FILE_END)<br>
SetFileBitrate (FileHandle,bitrate)<br>
Alternatively, a data area necessary for real time<br>
recording/reproduction can be pre-allocated in advance as an<br>
allocated/unrecorded state using the SetFileBitrate<br>
(FileHandle,bitrate). Here, when the application layer knows<br>
a bit rate, and an API for converting the bit rate into the<br>
number of blocks exists in the file system layer, the number<br>
of blocks obtained by the API can be secured as the data area<br>
necessary for real time recording/reproduction in an<br>
allocated unrecorded state using the SetFilePointer.<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 orders the<br>
DVD-RAM device driver 203 to seek for a file.<br>
In the third step, the DVD-RAM device driver 203 checks<br>
if real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned<br>
to a file, upon ordering of the file seeking function, and<br>
secures an allocated/unrecorded data area as large as the<br>
length for seeking according to minimum contiguous storage<br>
conditions (for example, file defect management, file<br>
allocation, file buffering, the magnitude of a minimum<br>
contiguous storage block, and bit rate information) specified<br>
in the assigned real time recording/reproduction attributes,<br>
as shown in FIG.11. One preallocated area or a plurality of<br>
areas are arranged in an ECC unit and can be allocated.<br>
C. <method of recording data a real time></method>
reproduction file&gt;<br>
In the first step, a Windows kernel API called to record<br>
the data of the real time recording/reproduction file is a<br>
write file. The application layer 201 calls a Windows kernel<br>
using a write file as in the following example, to store real<br>
time data:<br>
example: WriteFile<br>
(FileHandle,AV_Buffer,32*1024,NULL,NULL)<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 calls the<br>
file recording function of the DVD-RAM device driver 203.<br>
In the third step, the DVD-RAM device driver 203 checks<br>
if real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned<br>
to a file, upon calling the file recording function. If the<br>
real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned, A/V<br>
data to be recorded is recorded in an allocated/unrecorded<br>
area according to real time recording conditions. Upon<br>
recording, when no allocated/unrecorded area exists, the<br>
magnitude of recorded data is reported to the application<br>
layer 201. The application layer 201 pre-allocates an<br>
allocated/unrecorded area designated as the real time<br>
recording/reproduction attributes to record the left-over<br>
unrecorded data using a seek command SetFilePointer with<br>
reference to the amount of recorded data, and again records<br>
the left-over data.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG.12A, A/V data of 32*1024 bytes<br>
is recorded in an allocated/unrecorded area of 8*1024*1024<br>
bytes shown in FIG.11, and the residual area is still<br>
allocated as the allocated/unrecorded area.<br>
As shown in FIG.12B, when the amount of data recorded in<br>
a variable written of the application layer 201 is reported<br>
since the allocated/unrecorded area is 32*1024 bytes short,<br>
the file system layer automatically pre-allocates an<br>
unallocated area using bit rate information designated<br>
through the SetFileBitrate. As shown in FIG.12C, the residual<br>
data is recorded in the ECC block unit. When a defective<br>
block is generated during recording and an error is thus<br>
generated, a block corresponding to the defective block is<br>
excluded from the allocated/unrecorded area as shown in<br>
FIG.12D.<br>
Here, when the bit rates for sections can be<br>
distinguished from each other, information associated with<br>
the bit rate for each section can be recorded in a file<br>
control information area. That is, FIGS.13A and 13B show an<br>
example of a plurality of bit rate values (here, V1 ,V2 and V3 )<br><br>
and information associated with sections stored as real time<br>
recording/reproduction information in a file control<br>
information area when different bit rates are provided in<br>
different sections. FIGS.13C and 13D show an example of one<br>
bit rate value (here, V ) stored as real time recording/<br>
b<br>
reproduction information in a file control information area<br>
when an identical bit rate is provided in the entire file<br>
data section.<br>
D. <method of reproducing real time recording></method>
file data&gt;<br>
In the first step, a Windows kernel API called to<br>
reproduce the data of a real time recording/reproduction file<br>
is a read file. The application layer 201 calls a Windows<br>
kernel using the read file as in the following example, to<br>
reproduce real time data :<br>
example: ReadFile (FileHandle, AV_Buffer,32*1024,NULL,NULL)<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 orders the<br>
DVD-RAM device driver 203 to read a file.<br>
In the third step, the DVD-RAM device driver 203 checks<br>
if real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned<br>
to the file, when the file reading function is ordered. If<br>
the real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned,<br>
A/V data as long as the length for reproduction is reproduced<br>
from an A/V data area according to real time reproduction<br>
conditions.<br>
Here, when a defect is generated in a block to be<br>
reproduced, a read command indicating that allocated/<br>
unrecorded file attributes are assigned but not read is<br>
transmitted from the DVD-RAM device driver 203 to the drive<br>
204,<br>
a real time recording command and a reproducing command<br>
provided by a reproducing command provided by a command<br>
interface of the DVD-RAM device driver must be used upon real<br>
time recording/reproduction.<br>
E. <method of deleting part real time recording></method>
reproduction file data&gt;<br>
In the first step, a "DeletePartOfFile" is called as the<br>
Windows kernel API to delete part of the data of a real time<br>
recording/reproduction file. In order to delete part of real<br>
time data, the application layer 201 calls a Windows kernel<br>
using the "DeletePartOfFile" as in the following example:<br>
example: DeletePartOfFile (FileHandle,Offset,Size)<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 orders the<br>
DVD-RAM device driver 203 to delete part of the file.<br>
In the third step, when partial deletion of the file is<br>
ordered, the DVD-RAM device driver 203 checks if real time<br>
recording/reproduction attributes are assigned to the file,<br>
and deletes data from an A/V data area according to real time<br>
conditions if the real time recording/reproduction attributes<br>
have been assigned. Upon partial deletion of a file, a file<br>
for managing a dummy file or an ECC padding space list is<br>
created under a root directory on a system file.<br>
FIG.14A shows an area to be deleted from a real time<br>
file in which A/V data is arranged in ECC units. The deletion<br>
area is allocated to a free area as shown in FIG.14B, and an<br>
A/V data section pertaining to the deletion area, among an<br>
ECC block ranging over the boundary of the deletion area, is<br>
called a padding space. A/V data in this padding space is<br>
managed as a separate file on the system file and stored in<br>
an allocation descriptor (AD) list in an ECC padding space<br>
list. A/V data not pertaining to the deletion area, in the<br>
ECC block, is stored in the AD list of a file entry. The ECC<br>
padding space list is again updated according to a function<br>
such as deletion or writing. When an application of the<br>
method according to the present invention is an UDF system,<br>
the ECC padding space list can be described by a short<br>
allocation descriptor.<br>
In FIG.14B, the A/V file space and the padding space of<br>
the ECC block ranging over the boundary of the deletion area<br>
have extent lengths. As shown in FIG.14C, the A/V file space<br>
of the ECC block ranging over the boundary of the deletion<br>
area has both an extent length and an information length, but<br>
the padding space is managed as an allocation descriptor<br>
having an extent length and an information length of "0" in<br>
the AD list in an A/V file entry. An A/V file space not<br>
pertaining to the deletion area, in the ECC block, is also<br>
managed in the AD list in the AV file entry. In this case,<br>
the padding space can be defined as an extended allocation<br>
descriptor of UDF.<br>
F. <method of closing a real time recording></method>
file&gt;<br>
In the first step, a CloseHandle function is called as a<br>
Windows kernel API to close a real time file. In order to<br>
close a real time recording/reproduction file, the<br>
application layer 201 calls the Windows kernel 202 using the<br>
CloserHandle as in the following example:<br>
example : CloseHandle (FileHandle)<br>
In the second step, the Windows kernel 202 orders the<br>
DVD-RAM device driver 203 to seek for a file.<br>
In the third step, when the file closing function is<br>
ordered, the DVD-RAM device driver 203 updates file control<br>
information (file entry, etc) and disk information (e.g.,<br>
free area information, etc).<br>
According to the present invention as described above,<br>
real time recording/reproduction attributes are assigned to a<br>
file, and the file is recorded/reproduced in a different way<br>
from a general file. In this way, a real time recording/<br>
reproduction file can be recorded/reproduced in real time.<br>
Also, in the present invention, files are divided into<br>
real time files and general files, and defect management<br>
information, file allocation information, buffering<br>
information, and the magnitude information of a minimum<br>
contiguous storage block provided in each step are assigned<br>
as real time recording/reproduction information to the real<br>
time file upon recording/reproduction. Thus, real time<br>
recording/reproduction can be effectively performed.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the control<br>
information of a spindle motor is obtained from real time<br>
recording/reproduction information associated with a<br>
recording/reproduction bit rate, thus controlling the spindle<br>
motor.<br>

have been set, in response to the file deletion function being called, and deleting<br>
data from the disc according to a real time condition.<br>
12. The method as claimed in claim 11, comprising the steps of allocating the<br>
deletion area to a free area, and managing data in a padding space of an A/V<br>
data section pertaining to the deletion area among an error correction code<br>
(ECC) block ranging over a boundary of the deletion area as a separate file on a<br>
system file of the disc.<br>
13. The method as claimed in claim 12, comprising storing and managing the<br>
data from the padding space in an allocation description list in an ECC padding<br>
entry, wherein the padding space pertaining to the deletion area in an ECC block<br>
ranging over the boundary of the deletion area and an A/V file space not<br>
pertaining to the deletion area have extent lengths.<br>
14. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the selected process is the<br>
closing process, and the method comprises the steps of:<br>
having an application layer call a kernel layer using a close command ;<br>
having the kernel layer call a file closing function from a device driver; and<br>
having the device driver update file control information and disc information<br>
in response to the file closing function being called.<br>
15. A method of operating a file for a system for writing and/or rewriting real<br>
time files, substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
A method of operating a file for a system for writing and/or rewriting real<br>
time files to which real time recording/ or reproduction attribute information is<br>
assigned, comprises the step of operating the real time files in correspondence<br>
with any one process among a real time file creation process, an area allocation<br>
process, a recording process, a reproduction process, a deletion process, and a<br>
closing process, using the real time recording/ or reproduction attribute<br>
information.</td>
