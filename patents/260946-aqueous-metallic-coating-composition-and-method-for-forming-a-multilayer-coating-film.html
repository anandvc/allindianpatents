				<td>DESCRIPTION AQUEOUS METALLIC COATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR FORMING A MULTILAYER COATING FILM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an aqueous metallic coating composition, and a method for forming a multilayer coating film using the aqueous metallic coating composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Aqueous metallic coating compositions containing a metallic pigment such as an aluminum pigment have a problem in that the metallic pigment comes into contact with a large amount of water and reacts therewith to generate hydrogen gas.<br>
To solve this problem, incorporation of a phosphoric ester into the aqueous metallic coating composition has been proposed to protect the metallic pigment surface with a phosphoric ester by the adsorbing action of acidic hydroxy groups bonded to the phosphorus atoms in the ester, thereby inhibiting the reaction caused by direct contact between water and the metallic pigment.<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1987-30167 discloses an aqueous metallic coating composition comprising: an acrylic resin having a hydroxy value of 30 to 150 mg KOH/g and obtained by copolymerizing a specific phosphate group-containing monomer with an a, (3-ethylenic unsaturated monomer; a curing agent; and a metallic pigment. The publication describes that the aqueous metallic coating composition can form a coating film with excellent water resistance against discoloration and excellent metallic appearance. However, the coating film formed using the metallic coating composition is insufficient in terms of smoothness and water-resistant adhesion.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,151,125 discloses an aqueous metallic coating composition comprising: an acrylic resin having an acid value of 15 to 200 mg KOH/g and a hydroxy value of 20 to 200 mg<br><br>
KOH/g and prepared by copolymerizing an ethylenic monomer and a phosphoric acid group-containing monomer having an alkylene oxide chain; a curing agent; and a metallic pigment. The patent describes that the aqueous metallic coating composition can form a coating film with high adhesion and excellent water resistance against discoloration. However, the coating film formed using the aqueous metallic coating composition is insufficient in terms of smoothness, luster, and water-resistant adhesion.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an aqueous metallic coating composition that has excellent storage stability and is capable of forming a coating film with excellent smoothness, luster, and water-resistant adhesion.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for forming a multilayer coating film using the aqueous metallic coating composition.<br>
To solve the above problems, the present inventors conducted extensive research. As a result, the inventors found that when using an aqueous metallic coating composition prepared by blending an aqueous film-forming resin, a curing agent, and a metallic pigment with a specific phosphoric acid group-containing resin and a specific nitrogen-containing compound, the reaction between the metallic pigment and water is inhibited over a long period of time, so that the composition has excellent storage stability and can form a coating film with excellent smoothness, luster, and water-resistant adhesion.

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aqueous metallic coating composition of the present invention and the method for forming a multilayer coating film using the same achieve the following remarkable effects.<br>
(1) The aqueous metallic coating composition of the present invention has excellent storage stability because the reaction between the metallic pigment and water is inhibited over a long period of time, and is capable of forming a coating film with excellent smoothness, luster, and water-resistant adhesion over a substrate.<br>
The reason that the composition of the present invention has excellent storage stability, and is capable of forming a coating film with excellent smoothness, etc., is presumably as follows: a specific phosphoric acid group-containing resin firmly protects the surface of the metallic pigment in the composition of the present invention; and owing to the joint action of the phosphoric acid group-containing resin and a specific nitrogen-containing compound, the metallic pigment is uniformly dispersed in an aqueous medium.<br><br>
 (2) According to the method for forming a multilayer coating film of the present invention, it is possible to form a coating film with excellent smoothness, luster, and water-resistant adhesion over an automotive body or like substrate.<br>

The multilayer coating films of the test plates obtained in Examples 45 to 88 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6 mentioned above were tested for their coating film performance in smoothness, luster, finished appearance and water-resistant ahesion. The test method is as follows:<br>
Smoothness: Smoothness was evaluated based on the Wd value measured by "Wave Scan DOI" (tradename of BYK-Gardner GmbH). The Wd value is an idex that indicates the degree of surface roughness using the amplitude of wavelengths from about 3 to 10 mm, and the lower the measurement value, the higher the smoothness of the coated surface.<br>
Luster: The lightness values L* of the test plates defined in JIS Z 8729 when light was irradiated at an angle of 25°with respect to the sensor positioned on a line perpendicular to the coating film were determined using a spectrophotometric colorimeter (tradename "CM-512m3", manufactured by Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc.). The greater the value L*, the higher the luster of the coated surface.<br>
Finished appearance: the presence or absence of abnormalities such as cissing and dents on the test plates were visually observed and evaluated on the following scale: A: No abnormalities such as cissing or dents found; B: Almost no abnormalities such as cissing and dents found; and C: Considerable abnormalities such as cissing and dents found.<br>
Water-resistant ahesion: The test plates were immersed in warm water at 40°C for 240 hours and removed therefrom, and were then dried at 20°C for 12 hours. Lattice-like cuts were made in the multilayer coating films on the test plates with a knife to reach the base material to make 100 crosscuts having a size of 2 mm x 2 mm. Subsequently, an adhesive cellophane tape was adfixed to their surfaces, the tape was abruptly peeled off at 20°C, and the resultant conditions of the crosscut coating films<br><br>
were evaluated. The evaluation scale for water-resistant ahesion used was as follows:<br>
A: 100 crosscut sections of coating film retained, and no chipped edges were produced;<br>
B: 100 crosscut sections of coating film retained, but chipped edges were produced;<br>
C: 90 to 99 crosscut sections of coating film retained; and<br>
D: The number of remaining crosscut sections of coating film was 89 or less.<br>
