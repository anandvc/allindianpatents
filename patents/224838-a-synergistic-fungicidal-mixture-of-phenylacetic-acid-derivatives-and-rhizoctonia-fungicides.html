b)  at least one fungiC1de selected from fungiC1des of the formulae II to VII<br><br><br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide fungiC1dal mixtures having good fungiC1dal activity, in particular against fungal diseases in riC6, exC6eding the activity of the mixture components on their own.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures as claimed in claim 1.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are known per se and are described in the literature (WO 97/15552).<br>
The fungiC1des of the formulae II to VII are also known and described in the literature. In addition, they axe commerC1ally available under the trade names mentioned below in brackets:<br><br>
II: DE-A 27 32 257, common name: pencycuron <trade name: monc6ren from bayer></trade>
III:JP 01/104,514, common name: flutolanil (trade name: Moncut*, from Ninon Noyaku);<br>
IV: US 3,937,840, common name: mepronil (trade name: Basitac®, from Kumiai);<br>
V:  common name; thifluzamide (trade name: Greatam®, from Monsanto);<br>
VI: GB-A 1,312,536, OS 3,755,350; common name: iprodione (trade name: Rovral®, from Rhone-Poulenc);<br>
VII: AG Chem New Compound Review, Vol. 15 (1997), 50; common name: furametpyr (trade name: Limber®, from Sumitomo).<br>
Owing to their C=C and C=N double bonds, the preparation of the compounds I may yield E/Z isomer mixtures which can be separated into the individual compounds in a customary manner, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
However, if the synthesis yields isomer mixtures, a separation is generally not neC6ssarily required sinC6 in some cases the individual isomers can be converted into one another during the preparation for use or upon use (for example under the action of light, aC1ds or bases). Similar conversions may also occur after the use, for example in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus or animal pest to be controlled.<br>
With regard to the C=X double bond, preferenC6 is given to the E isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the -0CH3 or the -CH3 group in relation to the -CO2R1 group) with respect to their activity.<br>
With regard to the -C(R3)»NOCH2- double bond, preferenC6 is given to the C1s isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the radical R3 in relation to the -OCH2- group) with respect to their activity.<br>
In the definitions of the compounds I given at the outset, collective terms were used which generally represent the following groups:<br>
Halogen: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine;<br><br>

The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by expanding the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired by use of emulsifiers and dispersants.

Granules {eg. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silica gel, siliC1c aC1ds, silica gels [sic], silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaC6ous earth, calC1um sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as C6real meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, C6llulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>

active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR or HPLC spectrum [sic]).<br>
The corresponding formulations are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaC6s to be kept free from them with a fungiC1dally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds 1 and at least one of the compounds II to VII in the case of separate application.<br>

Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in perC6nt. These perC6ntages are converted into efficaC1es. The efficacy (H) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
W - (1 - a)-100/p<br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and P  corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficaC1es of the mixtures of the active ingredients were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Heeds J£, 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficaC1es.<br>

Leaves of potted riC6 seedlings cv "Tai-Nong 67" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active ingredient which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. The following day, the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae. The test plants were subsequently plaC6d in climatized chambers at 22-24°C and 95-99% relative atmospheric humidity for 6 days. The extent of the development of the disease on the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
The visually determined values for the perC6ntage of infected leaf area were converted into efficaC1es as perC6nt of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same infection as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% infection. The expected efficaC1es for active compound combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S.R.: "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbiC1de combinations", Weeds 15. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed efficaC1es.<br>
