				<td>This invention relates to an embeddable referenceselec-trode for use in concrete structures.<br>
The present invention relates to the improvements in or relating to the development of a stable and rugged reference electrode for use in reinforced and pre-stressed concrete bridges and structures.<br>
It is now fairly well recognised that reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges and structures exposed to marine or industrial environment need continuous monitoring of their condition because of their susceptibility to corrosion and environmental degradation. Electrochemical techniques such as half cell potential measurements, linear polarization measurements and impedance measurements have been suggested as monitoring tools. Use of a reliable reference electrode is imperative to these monitoring techniques.<br>
Cathodic protection of reinforced concrete structures has emerged as a fool-proof rehabilitation technique for corrosion damaged reinforced concrete structures. Potential criterion is widely adopted for optimizing the cathodic protection design. Reference electrode is essentially needed for continuous optimization of cathodic protection.<br>
Hitherto  various  reference  electrodes  such   as copper/copper   sulphate,    silver/silver   chloride, mercury/mercurous oxide, titanium substrate  insoluble<br>
electrode and graphite electrode have been suggested and utilised in concrete structures.  ASTM C 876 specifies<br>
the use of Cu/CuSO as reference electrode.<br>
Hitherto known electrodes have the following drawbacks:-<br>
(a)	Leakage of copper sulphate solution has been found to<br>
stain the concrete.  The seepage of CuSO solution would<br>
contaminate the concrete and these copper  ions would<br>
influence the steel behavior.<br>
(b)	Graphite electrodes are not sufficiently rugged.<br>
(c)	Surface-mounted reference electrodes are subjected to ultra violet radiation effect which considerably influences the measured values and lead to erroneous data [F.J.Ansuini and J.R.Dimond, "Long term stability testing of reference electrodes for reinforced concrete", Corrosion/94, Paper No.295 (Houston) TX NACE, 1994; Frank J.Ansuini and J.R.Dimond, "Factors affecting the accuracy of reference electrodes", Materials Performance, Vol.13, 1994, p.14]<br>
(d)	Ag/AgCl  electrodes are photosensitive [P.J.Ansuini  and<br>
J.R.Dimond  "Long-term stability testing of reference<br>
electrodes for reinforced concrete", Corrosion/94, Paper<br>
No.295 (Houston), TX, NACE, 1994; Frank J.Ansuini and J.R.Dimond, "Factors affecting the accuracy of reference electrodes", Materials Performance, Vol.13, 1994, p. 14; M.H.Peterson and R.E.Groover, "Material performance", May     1972, p.14.<br>
(e)	PbO -MnO  coated graphite electrodes are found to be<br>
2    2<br>
unstable in alkaline concrete environment [unpublished results, CECRI].<br>
(f)	Hg/HgO electrode as it is, is unstable when embedded  in<br>
concrete [C.Dehaghanian, C.R.Root and C.E.Locke;  Review<br>
of embeddable reference electrode for Portland cement concrete corrosion 81, NACE conference, April 1981, Ontario, Canada, Paper 45.]<br>
(g)	Mo/MoO  and AgCl electrodes were found unstable during<br>
3<br>
o winter  when   the  temperature  dropped  below  0 C.<br>
[H.C.Schell,D.G Manning : evaluation of performance  of<br>
cathodic  protection   system  on  reinforced  concrete<br>
bridge  super  structure, corrosion  85,  Massachusetts,<br>
March,  1985, paper 263].<br>
(h)   Zn / ZnSO electrode show erratic variations  in<br>
potentials. [D.G.Manning and H.C.Schell, Early performance of eight environmental cathodic protection systems at the Burlington Bay Skyway Test site", Transportation Research Record 1041, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington D.C. 1985].<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an embeddable reference electrode for use  in concrete structures which is rugged, stable and can give reliable<br>
data. Another object of the present invention is to provide an embeddable electrode which is unaffected by temperature changes and chloride ion concentration changes in the surrounding medium. Still another object of the present invention is to develop an electrode to be sued in soil. An embodiment of the embeddable reference electrode of the present invention is shown in Figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The system consists of a glass tube (8) in which 316 stainless steel wire (3) of approximately 1.5 mm dia is dipped in mercury (4). The mercury is in contact with mercuric oxide (5) which in turn is in contact with saturated calcium hydroxide (6). The plug (7) is made of a cement paste to act as a bridge with the bulk concrete. The stainless steel wire is fixed in a Teflon gasket (2) and electrical connections are made using coaxial copper wire (l).This reference electrode is not going to be used in cocreting relating to atomic power station and atomic energy.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an embeddable reference electrode for use in concrete structures which comprises, an open ended tubular casing (8) of inert material, the bottom end of the said casing being plugged (7) with cement paste, characterised in that above the said cement plug (7) is provided with layers of saturated calcium hydroxide (6), mercuric oxide (5) and mercury (4) respectively, a stainless steel wire (3) is fixed onto the top end of the said casing (8) by teflon gasket (2) in such a manner that the said wire dips in the mercury (4) &amp; mercuric oxide (5), the top end of the said wire (3) is provided with copper wire (1) for electrical connections.<br>
The present invention provides an embeddable, rugged stable reference electrode for use in concrete structures. This reference electrode exhibits better micro reversibility and a minimum temperature coefficient, unaffected by the influence of chloride ions present in the system. This reference electrode offers minimum IR drop in the potential measurements. This reference electrode is used for corrosion potential measurements, corrosion rate determinations and to follow cathodic protection potentials of steel reinforcements. The electrode is usually placed close to the steel reinforcement. Prior to the casting of concrete, electrical connections are made to the electrode through extended shield copper wires. The said reference electrode doesn't have any harmful effect in chemical reaction of cement hydration process<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustrations of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Micro-reversibility performance:-<br>
This test is carried out on a reference electrode to check the reversibility of the electrode and      reproduci-<br>
bility of the electrode potentials. It is carried out on a three electrode electrochemical cell. The developed embeddable electrode is used as a working electrode. A large platinum foil (2.5 x 2.5 cm area) as a counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode commercially available as reference electrode respectively. Bio Analytical System (BAS 100A) is used for small amplitude cyclic voltammetry. The amplitude of potentials is + 15 mV and the sweep rate is 1 mV/sec. The resultant current-potential curve (voltammogram) is recorded. From the open circuit potential, the cyclic polarisations are done. The zero current crossing potentials (ZCCP) for the forward and backward scans are noted. The difference in potentials values ( E) is the measure  of  irreversibility.  For a  perfect reference<br>
electrode system,   E → 0  as the sweep rate tends to<br>
zero.<br>
Figure  2 presents the cyclic current-potential  (cyclic voltammogram)  of the saturated calomel  electrode supplied by Elico P Ltd, Hyderabad.<br>
Figure  3 presents the cyclic current-potential  (cyclic voltammogram)  of the saturated calomel  electrode  supplied by Toshniwal Brothers  P Ltd, Mumbai.<br>
Figure 4 presents the cyclic current-potential  (cyclic voltammogram)  of  the developed embeddable reference electrode.<br>
Figure  5 presents the cyclic current-potential  (cyclic voltammogram)  of the laboratory-made Hg/HgO reference electrode of the present invention.<br>
Table  1  presents the results of  the micro-reversibility tests.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
MICRO-REVERSIBILITY TESTS  (Table Removed)<br>
It may be seen from the above table that the newly-developed embeddable reference electrode has the desirable reversibility characteristics when compared to the commercially available systems.<br>
Example 2<br>
Temperature coefficient:<br>
The developed reference electrode with glass tubing  is<br>
o      o stable in the temperature range of 30 C to 50 C;  Figure<br>
6 presents the variation of the developed electrode potential versus saturated calomel electrode with temperatures. A temperature coefficient of 4.5 mV per degree centigrade is obtained. By proper thermal insulation, this can be minimised and the performance of the<br>
 electrode at higher temperatures (65 C) can be studied.<br>
Example 3<br>
Influence of chloride ion concentration present in the<br>
surrounding medium<br>
To study the stability and reproductibility of the embed-<br>
dable reference electrode in presence of chloride ions<br>
in the  surrounding medium, the  following tests were<br>
carried out.  Saturated calcium hydroxide solution and<br>
saturated calcium hydroxide containing chloride ion<br>
solutions were used.  The potentials of three embeddable<br>
electrodes were used for study.  The potentials of these<br>
electrodes were monitored in saturated Ca(OH)  solutions<br>
using saturated calomel electrode for 8 days.  Figure  7<br>
presents the variation of the electrode potentials for 8<br>
days in saturated Ca(OH)  solution.  A value of - 56 + 2<br>
mV Vs SCE was obtained.<br>
The potentials of another three electrodes were monitored  in saturated Ca(OH)  containing 500 ppm chloride<br>
ions.  Figure 8 presents the variation of the electrode<br>
potentials  for 8 days in saturated Ca(OH)  solution<br>
containing 500 ppm of chloride ions.  A constant value<br>
of - 53 mV Vs SCE was obtained.<br>
It may be seen from the above example that the performance of the newly-developed embeddable electrode is not influenced    even in the presence of 500 ppm of chloride<br>
ion in the medium.<br>
Example 4<br>
Long-term stability :<br>
10  x  10 x 10 cm concrete cubes of  strength M   were<br>
used.  The reference electrodes were embedded 1 cm away<br>
from the 5 mm steel rod.  After curing for 28 days  in<br>
distilled water,  the potentials of  steel  rods were<br>
followed up to 28 days.  Three types of concrete cubes<br>
were used: (i) Plain concrete; (ii) Concrete containing<br>
50  ppm chloride  ions and  (iii)  concrete containing<br>
30,000 ppm chloride ions.<br>
Figure  9  presents the variations of the  potential  of<br>
rebar in M  concrete cubes and concrete cubes  contain-20<br>
ing various amounts of chlorides. In 30,000 ppm chloride ion containing concrete cubes the rebar exhibited very active potentials indicating the corrosion of steel. This indicates that the potentials of the embed-dable electrode may be used as a criteria to monitor the corrosion behaviour of steel rebar up to 28 days in chloride containing environments.<br>
Example 5<br>
Application of buried pipeline :<br>
A pipeline of 6.3 metres (21 feet) was buried below 1 metre  (3  feet) under the surface of the ground.   The soil    charactaeristics were uniform along the length of<br>
the pipe. The potentials of the pipe at various locations were monitored by two types of reference electrodes. The conventionally used copper/copper sulphate electrode, a surface mountable electrode, and the embeddable reference electrode were used for investigation. The embeddable reference electrode was also buried very close to the pipe and electrical connections were made. The soil surface was made wet with tap water. At the end of the 5th minute, the potentials of the buried pipe was followed with the distance from one end. The potentials were also measured using the Cu/CuSO  electrode at<br>
the end of 30th minute of wetting using a high impedance<br>
voltmeter  along  its length from one side.  It may be<br>
seen  from figure 10 that the potentials measured using<br>
the  embeddable electrode were nearly steady along the<br>
length of the pipe.  The Cu/CuSO   reference electrode<br>
potentials  were varying along the length of	the pipe.<br>
The embeddable electrode exhibited a constant	potential<br>
along the length of the pipe indicating the	uniformity<br>
of the soil characteristics.<br>
Example 6<br>
Application to Cathodic Protection :<br>
This  example  is given to illustrate the use of the newly-  developed  embeddable  reference  electrode  to follow the cathodic protection potentials of the buried pipeline.<br>
A pipeline of 6.3 metres (21 feet) was buried below 1 metre (3 feet) under the surface of the ground. A titanium substrate insoluble anode mesh (2 feet x 0.5 feet) was buried on one side of the pipe. The embedda-ble reference electrode was buried very close to the pipe. Electrical connections were made using shielded copper wires.' A rectifier was used and different ca-thodic currents were passed.<br>
A laboratory made Cu/CuSO electrode was used to measure<br>
cathodic potentials of the pipeline. The soil surface was made wet by pouring tap water and the potentials of the pipe along the length at the end of 5th and 3 0th minutes after.wetting was measured using a high impedance digital voltmeter.<br>
Figure 11 presents the variation of the potential of the buried pipe along its length at different applied cathodic currents (2 mA and 5 mA) measured using Cu/CuSO<br>
reference electrode. The influence of applied cathodic currents are not seen.<br>
Figure 12 presents the variation of the potential of the buried pipeline along its length at different applied cathodic currents (2 mA and 5 mA) measured using embed-dable  reference  electrode.  The influence  of  applied cathodic currents are clearly seen.<br>
The present invention of an embeddable reference electrode has the following advantages :-<br><br>
1.	The conventionally used platinum wire has been replaced<br>
by 316 stainless steel wire, thereby contributing to the<br>
ruggedness of the system.  As the 316  stainless steel<br>
does not dissolve in mercury, it offers an unique advan<br>
tage as a rugged electrode.<br>
2.	The compatibility with the concrete medium has been enhanced by the cement plug provided at the bottom.<br>
3.	The stability of the electrode has been enhanced by encasing the mercury and the mercuric oxide  in the fashion in which the new design has been proposed.<br>
4.	The new design helps in improving the  stability and<br>
electrochemical reversibility of the system by prevent<br>
ing  the  chloride ion entering  and contaminating the<br>
saturated calcium hydroxide solution.<br>
5.	The new design has got the adaptability for embedding in concrete structures at any orientation.<br>
6.	The  new design enhances the performance  of  the<br>
mercury/mercuric oxide reference  electrode up to  a<br>
o maximum temperature of 6 5 C.<br>
7.	Provision of a cement plug helps in minimising the  IR<br>
drop  in the measurement of  electrode potentials and<br>
thereby increases the accuracy of measurements.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
