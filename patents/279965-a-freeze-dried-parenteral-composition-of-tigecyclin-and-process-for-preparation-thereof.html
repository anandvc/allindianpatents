3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
Technical Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable, freeze dried pharmaceutical composition of Tigecycline along with a suitable stabilizing agent and acidifying agent for parenteral administration. The pharmaceutical composition provides stabilization of Tigecycline thereby improving the shelf life during storage. The invention further relates to a process for preparation of said composition. <br>
<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Tigecycline, a derivative of minocycline that is modified to overcome tetracycline resistance, is the first of a novel class of glycylcyclines with expanded-spectrum properties. It is active in-vitro against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, anaerobes, ‘atypical’ bacteria as well as against many species of drug-resistant strains [e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii]. Similar to tetracyclines, Tigecycline inhibits protein translation by reversibly binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which impedes amino acid synthesis. Although the ribosomal binding sites of Tigecycline are similar to those of tetracycline, Tigecycline binds five times more effectively than tetracyclines. This allows Tigecycline to evade the common ribosomal protection mechanisms associated with resistance to tetracyclines. Because of its long side chain that blocks binding to most efflux proteins and transporters, Tigecycline also overcomes the efflux mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. In particular, since New Delhi Metallo-Lactamase-1 (NDM-1) was found among Gram-negative bacteria, which were highly resistant to all antibiotics except Tigecycline and colistin, Tigecycline has received high attention and has been regarded as the last resort to treat pan drug-resistant-bacteria (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 41 (2013) 110– 116).<br>
<br>
The first tetracycline antibiotics were discovered more than 50 years ago, and represented a significant advance in the treatment of many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, following their initial widespread use, a high incidence of tetracycline resistance among many bacteria has led to tetracyclines being relegated to second- or third-line therapy.<br>
<br>
In an attempt to restore the potential of tetracyclines as broad-spectrum antibiotics, systematic searches for tetracycline analogues with activity against both tetracycline-susceptible and tetracycline-resistant organisms were performed in the early 1990s. These efforts led to the identification of the glycylcyclines, including Tigecycline (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 4, 809-810 (October 2005).<br>
<br>
Tigecycline is a tetracycline derivative (a glycylcycline) for intravenous infusion. The chemical name of Tigecycline is (4S,4aS,5aR,12aS)-9-[2-(tert-butylamino)acetamido]-4,7-bis(dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,10,12,12a-tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide. The empirical formula is C29H39N5O8 and the molecular weight is 585.65gm/mol. Tigecycline is a light-sensitive, hygroscopic orange powder that is freely soluble in water and isotonic sodium chloride solution (Daily Med). The chemical structure of Tigecycline is given below:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Tigecycline is marketed as lyophilized product for intravenous infusion by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. under the trade name Tygacil®. Tigecycline is indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older for: Complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.<br>
<br>
Currently available formulations of Tigecycline is in lyophilized vial containing lactose monohydrate as stabilizing agent which does not provide desirable stability due to the sensitivity of Tigecycline against environmental stress. <br>
<br>
Further, Tigecycline is generally unstable to light, heat, humidity, acid, and the like and forms degradation product Tigecycline epimer, hence, it is necessary to develop a pharmaceutical composition which stabilizes the active compound and salt thereof for parenteral administration.<br>
In view of unstable nature of Tigecycline and the resultant challenges in preparing the lyophilized product for parenteral administration as mentioned above, the present inventors felt a need to develop a stable Tigecycline injectable composition using a suitable stabilizing agent which lowers the degradation of the active ingredient and improves shelf life of the composition.<br>
<br>
Indian Patent Number 268331 has disclosed a stable pharmaceutical composition of Tigecycline in lyophilized form comprising lactose as stabilizing agent. It is further disclosed in IN’331 that suitable carbohydrates stabilize Tigecycline against epimer formation at acidic pH. Examples of suitable carbohydrates include anhydrous, hydrated and solvated forms of mono and disaccharides selected from aldose monosaccharide or a disaccharide such as lactose, mannose, sucrose and glucose; preferably, a disaccharide such as lactose and sucrose. Lactose is most preferred.<br>
<br>
Tigecycline marketed products and the compositions known in the art contain higher percentage of degradation impurities which includes Tigecycline epimer impurity.   <br>
<br>
In pursuit to circumvent the above problem, there is a need in the art to provide improved/stable Tigecycline freeze-dried composition which can reduce Tigecycline epimer formation and other oxidative degradation impurities thereby making the product stable with longer shelf-life.<br>
<br>
The above objective is realised in the present invention by providing a stable, freeze-dried pharmaceutical composition comprising Tigecycline and a suitable stabilizing agent which reduces the Tigecycline epimer formation and other degradation impurities with improved shelf life of the composition.<br>
<br>

It is observed from the above examples that, the composition comprising Tigecycline and Sulfobutyl ether betacyclodextrin sodium exhibits good stability with less impurity after 40 days (Example 8).<br>
<br>
<br>
Example 9<br>
3.0gm Tigecycline (active) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt was added to an aqueous solution containing 60.0gm of Sulfobutyl ether betacyclodextrin sodium and stirred for some time. Adjust the pH about 5.45 with 1.0 N HCL solution (pH limit 4.5 to 7.0). The solution was filtered and the resulting solution was loaded into 20 vials (30 ml) with each containing 15.0 ml solution. The solution in each vial was lyophilized using freeze dryer according to conventional method, thereby obtaining the lyophilized compositions each comprising 150mg of Tigecycline. The resulting lyophilized preparation was stored at different storage temperatures at different time intervals and the content of Tigecycline was tested.</td>
