COMBUSTION ENGINE 	<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a cylinder discrimination apparatus for an internal combustion engine and in particular to a cylinder discrimination apparatus for an internal combustion engine suitable for used in an automobile use internal combustion engine wherein during a rotation of the engine which cylinder existing in a specific stroke is discriminated.<br>
In general, an internal combustion engine carries out during one cycle of an operation thereof plural strokes, namely two strokes or four strokes are discriminated.  For this, in the internal combustion engine comprising a multi-cylinder having more than two cylinders, to control an ignition timing etc. and a fuel injection timing of a respective cylinder, it is necessary to discriminate that which cylinder exists in a specific stroke, for example in a compression stroke, or not.  For the above stated reason, in commonly, the internal combustion engine has a cylinder discrimination apparatus.<br>
In a conventional cylinder discrimination apparatus for an internal combustion engine, various different means have been proposed.  As a first prior art in the<br><br>
2<br>
prior arts, there is a technique which is described in Japanese application patent publication No. Sho 63-37336. This technique shown in the first prior art, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of this prior art publication paper, is that a compression stroke of a first cylinder is discriminated in accordance with an output signal of a crank angle detection sensor and an output signal of a<br>
			cylinder discrimination sensor which is installed to a<br>
			cum shaft.<br>
  Further, as a second prior art in the prior arts, there is a technique which is described in Japanese application patent laid-open publication No. Hei 5-86953. In this technique shown in the second prior art, as shown in this prior art patent specification, three projections for discriminating a crank angle to a disc for use a rotation number detection which is mounted on a cum shaft of an internal combustion engine are provided with unequal intervals and also a projection for discriminating a cylinder is added to a first cylinder, then plural signals are generated with unequal intervals.<br>
An arrangement state of pulse intervals of the above stated plural signals is checked and a crank angle is discriminated at a time point when a predetermined arrangement pattern is detected using a crank angle discrimination pulse, and at a time point when a predetermined arrangement pattern including the crank angle discrimination use pulse is detected or a time point when<br><br>
3<br>
a change of a predetermined pulse intervals is detected at a point time of the cylinder discrimination use pulse, the discrimination for the cylinder is carried out.<br>
According to Fig. 22 of the present specification as the prior art, a means for discriminating the cylinder at the time point of the change of the above stated predetermined pulse interval will be explained.  Fig. 22 shows a three-cylinder internal combustion engine and also shows a relationship of a stroke state of a respective cylinder and a detection position of the crank angle sensor according to the prior art.<br>
In Fig. 22, O mark during the stroke shows an air intake stroke and an arrow mark shows an ignition position.  Against to a compression stroke of the respective cylinder, two signals (A signal, B signal) are generated and further to detect the compression stroke of one first cylinder there is C signal.  With two rotations of a crank shaft in this figure, one cycle of the strokes of the engine is completed and this forms a basic period of a four-cycle internal combustion engine.<br>
A detailed position relationship among the three signals comprised of the A signal, the B signal, and the C signal in Fig. 22 will be shown in Fig. 23.  A CR signal indicates a signal generation position which is detected by the crank angle sensor.<br>
The A signal generates at a 75° before compression top dead center.  The B signal generates at a 5° before<br><br>
4<br>
compression top dead center of the respective cylinder. The C signal generates only one time during the crank shaft two rotations and a position thereof generates at a 210° before compression top dead center of the first cylinder and an angle between the signals is shorter than those of the other.<br>
The cylinder discrimination for the engine is defined when the discrimination conditions shown in a table shown in Fig. 23 are satisfied.  In concretely, in accordance with a resume of the time between the CR signals, using a following formula 1 the cylinder of the engine is discriminated.<br>
TRATIO		&gt; MKRAT#   	 (1)<br>
wherein,<br>
MKRAT# :  cylinder discrimination coefficient TRATIO :  pulse period ratio<br>
The pulse period ratio TRATIO is calculated according to a following formula 2.<br>
TRATIO = (Toldl + Told2)/T   	 (2)<br>
wherein,<br>
Toldl :  last time pulse period Told2 :  last but one pulse period T    :  newest pulse period<br>
The above stated MKRAT# takes a value of 5 degree in this case.  Namely, using a conversion with an angle ratio, at C signal generation time, Told2 has 175°, Toldl has 65°, T has 35°, and then TRATIO has TRATIO = (175 +<br><br>
5<br>
65)/35 = 7.5.  Similarly to, at B signal generation time, since Told2 has 65°, Toldl has 175°, T has 65°, and then TRATIO has TRATIO = (65 + 175)/65 =3.7.  In a case of the A signal generation time, since Told2 has 170°, Toldl has 65°, T has 170°, and then TRATIO has TRATIO = (170 + 65)/170 = 1.38.<br>
To sum up the above stated facts, since TRATIO has 1.38 at the A signal generation time, 3.7 at the B signal generation time, and 7.5 at the C signal generation time, when the cylinder discrimination coefficient MKRAT# is 5, it is possible to discriminate the C signal between the A signal and the B signal.<br>
Herein, in the technique described in the first prior art, there is a problem in which at a start time of the engine until the maximum one rotation of a Cum shaft, namely two rotations of a crank shaft it is impossible to carry out a cylinder discrimination for the engine.<br>
Further, in the technique described in the second prior art, a stroke discrimination of the engine can be carried out speedy however since the cylinder discrimination for the engine is carried out using a time ratio between the signals there is a problem in which in the engine having a large rotation fluctuation it is a possibility about an error discrimination of the cylinder.<br>

In the central processing unit 193, a voltage level of the signal line 198 changes from "LOW" to "HIGH", with a timing shown in a numeral C of Fig. 9 an interrupt processing is carried out.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a correspondence relationship between the stroke of the respective cylinder, the CR signal which is the output signal of the crank angle sensor 13, an engine air intake valve opening and closing timing signal (hereinafter, it is abbreviated as a WT signal) which is the output signal of the  cam angle sensor 14, when the cylinder discrimination apparatus of this embodiment of the internal combustion engine having the cylinder discrimination apparatus of this embodiment according to the present invention is adopted to a three-cylinder internal combustion engine 1.<br><br>
21<br>
Since the above stated first signal member 15 forms the three raise portion groups comprised of the first raise portion group 15a, the second raise portion group 15b, and the third raise portion group 15c and to each of the three raise portion groups 15a, 15b and 15c the two raise portions E and E or the three raise portions E, E and E are provided, the CR signal from the above stated crank angle sensor 13 is outputted as a signal in which the two numbers or the three numbers are taken as one group and further in the WT signal from the above stated cum angle sensor 14 one number signal is outputted with equal intervals.<br>

Fig. 11 show a control block diagram for carrying out the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the internal combustion engine of this embodiment according to the present invention.<br>
The CR signal of the crank angle sensor 13 is<br>
inputted into an input processing means 260 and then the<br>
noises etc. are removed.  The VVT signal of the cam angle sensor 14 is inputted into an input processing means 220 and then the noises etc. are removed.<br>
The above stated respective signal is inputted into the crank angle count means 230 and when the VVT signal of the above stated  cam angle sensor 14 is inputted, the number of the signals of the crank angle sensor 13 is counted the number until a next WT signal of the above stated cum angle sensor 14 is inputted and then the count signal is outputted continuously.<br>
In the case of the three-cylinder internal combustion engine, the above stated count signal is patterned continuously and it is generated and outputted as "322322322 ....".  Thus generated patterned count signal is outputted into a cylinder discrimination means 240, and then the cylinder discrimination for the engine is<br><br>
23<br>

Fig. 15 is a control block diagram of the cylinder discrimination of the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine the another embodiment according to the present invention of Fig. 13.<br>
In the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine of this embodiment according to the present invention, as shown in Fig- 13, the CR signal of the crank angle sensor 13 is made as a standard, the WT signal of<br>
the cam angle sensor 14 is counted.  To generate the WT<br><br><br>
signal of the above stated cam angle sensor 14 in the two<br>
cylinders, two raise portions are formed on the above stated second signal member 51.  The output positions of the above stated two WT signals are shown in this embodiment in Fig. 13 and further as shown in Fig. 14, "3" or "4" count numbers of the CR signal are outputted to the one WT signal.<br><br>
25<br>
In a case where the count number of the CR signal is "3", using only this signal the cylinder of the engine can be discriminated and further in a case where the count number of the CR signal is "4% using only this signal the cylinder of the engine can be discriminated.<br>
As stated in above, Fig. 15 shows a control block diagram for carrying out the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine of this embodiment according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The CR signal of the crank angle sensor 13 is<br>
inputted into the input processing means 260 and then the  noises etc. are removed.  On the other hand, the VVT signal of the cam angle sensor 14 is inputted into the<br>
input processing means 280-280 and then the noises etc. are    <br><br>
removed.  The CR signal of the crank angle sensor 13 is inputted into a CR signal count means 270 and in the above stated CR signal count means 270 the number of the signals of the crank angle sensor 13 is counted.  The VVT signal of the cum angle sensor 14 is inputted into a cam angle signal count means 290 and the number of the signals of the above stated cam angle sensor 13 xs counted.<br>

26<br>
number of the CR signals of the crank angle sensor 13 and<br><br>
the signal of the cam angle sensor 14.<br>
The pattern state of the CR signal of the above stated crank angle sensor 13 is generated as "343434 ... ", as illustrated in Fig. 14.  The thus generated pattern is sent to a cylinder discrimination means 310 and then the cylinder discrimination for the engine is carried out. The cylinder discrimination for the engine is carried out by taking a predetermined data to the cylinder<br>
discrimination standard store means 320-320 and by confirming<br>
it coincides to whether the above stated count number or<br>
not.<br>
When the count number of the crank angle count sensor 13 is "3" and the count number of the counter number of the cam angle sensor 14 is "1", it discriminates as the compression stroke of the second cylinder for the engine.  When the count number of the crank angle count sensor 13 is "4" and the count number of the counter number of the cum angle sensor 14 is "1", it discriminates as the compression stroke of the third cylinder for the engine.  As a result, it is possible to discriminate the cylinder for the engine in this second embodiment according to the present invention similarly to the above stated first embodiment according to the present invention.<br>

As stated in above, the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine of the embodiments according to the present invention is explained in detail, however the present invention is not limited to this, in the range without the deviation of the spirit of the present<br><br>
29<br>
invention described in the claims, various alternations in the design can be performed.<br>
For example, in the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the internal combustion engine of the above stated embodiments according to the present invention, the signal of the cam angle sensor 14 is counted by the signal of the cam angle sensor 13 as the standard and further the signal of the cam angle sensor 14 is generated in the two cylinders, however reversely the plural signals of the cum angle sensor 14 are provided on one cylinder and the number can be set in every cylinder, the same effects can be obtained.  However, in this case, the problem will be complicated one and the load of the computer is increased.<br>
Fig. 20 is a view showing a cylinder discrimination apparatus for an internal combustion engine of a further another embodiment according to the present invention and a relationship view showing a crank angle signal (a CR signal) and a cam angle signal (a VVT signal) in a case where the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine is adopted to a four-cylinder engine, and Fig. 21 is a comparison view showing the crank angle signal (the CR signal) and the cum angle signal (the WT signal) of the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine of Fig. 20.<br>

Further, in the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the internal combustion engine of the above stated embodiments according to the present invention, to the first and the second signal members 15 and 51 the raise portions are formed, however to the first and the second signal members 15 and 51, in place of the raise portions recessed portions can be formed.<br>
As understood from the above stated description, the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the engine according to the present invention has the two detection means (the crank angle sensor and the cam angle sensor) and the two detection means to be subjected to detection (the first signal member and the second signal member) and also by specifying the number and the arrangement position of the detection portion (the raise portion or the recessed portion) of the above stated detection means to be subjected to detection and further by detecting the position, the cylinder for the engine is discriminated, at the start time of the engine, before the cam shaft rotates the maximum one rotation, namely the crank shaft<br><br>
31<br>
rotates two rotations, it is possible to carry out the cylinder discrimination for the engine.<br>
Further, in the above stated cylinder discrimination using the cylinder discrimination apparatus for the internal combustion engine according to the present invention, since the cylinder discrimination for the engine is carried out not using the time ratio between the signals, even in the engine having the large rotation fluctuation, the error discrimination of the cylinder for the engine is not occurred.<br><br>
