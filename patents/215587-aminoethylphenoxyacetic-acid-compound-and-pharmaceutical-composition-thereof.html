				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to aminoethylphenoxyacetic acid derivatives and phannaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are useful as medicaments.<br>
Background Art<br>
Urolithiasis is a disease generating calculi in the lumen of the entire urinary tract from the kidney to the urethra. The calculi is thought to be formed in a series of events such as nucleation of the urinary component, crystallization, aggregation, concretion, and enlargement. Urinary flow is often obstructed by calculi, which results in the rise of intra-ureteral pressure, leading to pain. An analgesic and an antispastic are prescribed for the pain. However, the use of the analgesic is only a temporary symptomatic therapy for the pain, and is not expected to treat urolitiasis fundamentally at all. The effectiveness of an anti-cholinergic, one of the antispastic, is also not satisfactory. Therefore, the drugs which relieve pain and promote the removal of calculi by widening the ureter with their strong relaxing effects are desired (The Journal of Urology, Vol.152, pp.1095-1098 (1994)).<br>
It was recently confirmed that both ß2- and ß3-adrenoceptors are present in human ureter as ß-adrenoceptor subtypes. It is reported that a drug having stimulating effects on both ß2- and ß3-adrenoceptors is extremely useful as an agent for relieving pain and promoting the removal of calculi in urolithiasis because a compound having stimulating<br><br>
effects on both ß2- and ß3-adrenoceptors shows potent relaxing efffceta on uiretsr (Inter-national applicat).on publication^ W097/197UUJ<br>

In the present invention, compounds with less ß1-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects in comparison with the above ß2- and ß3-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects are preferable in order to reduce burdens on the heart and so as not to induce side effects such as tachycardia. Some compounds of the present invention are ß2-. and ß3-adrenoceptor-stimulants with less ß1-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects. As examples of such compounds, compounds represented by the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

Furthermore, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention are highly safe. For example, in acute toxicity test using rats, any dead rats were not observed by a single administration of 1,000 rng/kg of 2-[4-[2-[[(S,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-l-methylethyI]amino]ethyl]phenoxy]acetic acid.<br>
In consequence, the compounds represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have potent and extremely useful stimulating effects on both ß2- and. ß3-adrenoceptors.<br>
When the aminoethylphenoxyacetic acid derivatives represented by the general formula (I) above of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are employed in the practical treatment, they are administered orally or parenterally in the form of appropriate compositions such as tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, injections and the like. These pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in accordance with conventional methods using conventional pharmaceutical carriers, excipients and other additives.<br>
The dosage is appropriately decided depending on the sex, age, body weight, degree of symptoms and the like of each patient to be treated, which is approximately within the range of from 1 to 1,000 mg per day per adult human in the case of oral administration and approximately within the range of from 0.01 to 100 mg per day per adult human in the case of parenteral administration, and the daily dose can be divided into one to several doses per day.<br><br>

Test Example 1<br>
The experiment for measuring  ß2-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects<br>
The uterus of pregnant SD rats (pregnancy day of 21) was isolated and longitudinal smooth muscle strips (about 15 mm in length and 5 mm in width) free from the basal plate were prepared. The experiment was conducted according to the Magnus method. The preparations were mounted with an initial resting tension of about 1.0 g in the Locke's-Ringer solution maintained at 37°C and gassed with a mixture of 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2. The spontaneous contraction of the uterus was measured by an isometric force-transducer and recorded by a rectigraph. The drug solution was added cumulatively to the organ bath every 5 minutes. Uterine activities were calculated as the sum of the amplitudes of the spontaneous contraction for 5 minutes, and the percent change before and after the drug application were compared. EC50 value was determined as the molar concentration required to produce 50 % of own maximal relaxation elicited by each drug. The result was shown in the following table.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
The experiment for measuring ß3-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects<br>
The ferret ureter was isolated and the ring smooth muscle strips were prepared (about 20 mm in length). The experiment was conducted according to the Magnus method. The preparations were mounted with an initial resting tension of about 0.5 g in the Krebs-Henseleit solution maintained at 31°C and gassed with a mixture of 95 % 02 and 5 % C02. The spontaneous contraction of the ureter was measured by an isometric force-transducer and recorded by a rectigraph. The drug solution was added cumulatively to the organ bath every 5 minutes. Ureteral activities were calculated as<br><br>
the sum of the amplitudes of the spontaneous contraction for 5 minutes, and the percent change before and after the drug application were compared. EC50 value was determined as the molar concentration required to produce 50 % of own maximal relaxation elicited by each drug. The result was shown in the following table.<br>
Test Example 3<br>
The experiment for measuring ß1-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects<br>
The rat atrium (Sprague-Dawley, 350-400g) was isolated and the experiment was conducted according to the Magnus methods. The preparations were mounted with an initial resting tension of about 1.0 g in the Krebs-Henseleit solution maintained at 37°C and gassed with a mixture of 95% 02 and 5% CO2. The spontaneous contraction of the atrium was measured by an isometric force-transducer and recorded by a rectigraph. The drug solution was added cumulatively to the organ bath. EC 4 20 value was determined as the molar concentration required to produce 20 beats/minute increment of the heart rate. The result was shown in the following table.<br><br>
