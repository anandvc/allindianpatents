				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for enhancement of carbon and size segregation of sinter mix for sinter bed preparation resulting in uniform heat generation through the sinter bed height. More particularly the invention relates to a system comprising screen type charging means for segregation of sinter mix along with means for providing and drawing the sinter mix. The invention particularly relates to means for segregation of sinter mix according to size and carbon content employing plurality of moveable rods and stiffeners with defined gaps of progressively increased size, which comprise the screen type charging means held at a defined angle.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Sinter (Agglomerate) is a feed material to blast furnace in the steel industry. In the sinter plant agglomeration of iron ore fines into a lumpy porous mass occurs by incipient fusion i.e. sintering. In a sinter plant prepared burden i.e. proportionate mixture of iron ore fines, flux fines, lime fines, coke breeze after balling in a balling drum is charged to a sinter machine through inclined plate.<br>
In such a conventional charging system segregation is not achieved as large particles get trapped in the sinter mix and do not get a chance to go the bottom. Segregation is defined as the ratio of wt% coarser particles at the bottom to the coarser particles at the top or vice versa i.e.-3mm fraction at top to -3mm fraction at the bottom. This is known as segregation index and the values should be more than 1.5 for a better sintering process. In the conventional charging system piling up of quasi-particles takes place in front of the inclined plate resulting in undesired segregation behaviour. This results in non uniform generation of heat because of partial segregation of carbon and size of sinter mix along the height of the bed, leading to a poor quality of sinter.<br>
Thus there is need to enhance the size and carbon segregation of sinter mix to the strand so that heat generation is uniform through the bed height and good quality sinter is obtained.<br>
2<br><br>
Objects of Invention:<br>
Thus an object of the present invention is to provide a system for enhancement of carbon and size segregation of sinter mix comprising screen type charging means along with means for providing and drawing the sinter mix to the said screen.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide mechanical separation of different size particles in the sinter mix so as to achieve the smallest size particles at the top most layer and bigger size particles at the bottom layer of the sinter bed and high content of carbon in the top layer of sinter bed and lesser carbon content at the bottom of the sinter bed.<br>
Statement of Invention:<br>
Thus according to main aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for<br>
enhancement of carbon and size segregation of sinter mix for sinter bed preparation<br>
resulting in uniform heat generation through the bed height and providing high quality<br>
sinter, said system comprising:<br>
i) means for providing sinter mix;<br>
ii) means for drawing the sinter mix; and<br>
iii) screen type charging means for segregation of sinter mix.<br>
Detailed Description of Invention:<br>
In the system of the present invention the prepared burden of sinter mix is stored in a surge hopper with small opening at the bottom. This acts the means for providing the sinter mix. The means for drawing the sinter mix from hopper is a drum feeder fitted with suitable drive below the hopper. The screen type charging means of the system of present invention is so arranged to be at an angle 29 to 31 degrees , preferably 30Â° to receive the sinter mix from the drum feeder for segregation of the sinter mix<br>
This screen type charging means comprises preferably 32 number of moveable rods and preferably 13 numbers of stiffeners/guides for passing the rods with defined gaps between them and arranged in a manner to form an arc of radius of about 1.4 m. These rods preferably of 20mm diameter are placed at distance ranging from 12 to 40<br>
3<br><br>
mm. The rods at the top are more closely spaced than those at the bottom and are adapted to screen the particles of increasing size. The said rods with similar spacing are grouped together to form plurality of sections. There may be 3 to 6 sections in the screen type charging means<br>
The alternate rods in the system are adapted to move horizontally in opposite directions at defined arc length kept at specific angle. The spacing between the stiffeners is equivalent to the horizontal movement of the rods. The movement of the rods is carried out by suitable drive assembly. The alternate rods moving in opposite direction over comes the jamming of sinter mix with a suitable drive.<br>
The raw materials used for the sinter mix are iron ore fines, flux fines coke breeze fines, return fines and the like which are proportioned and mixed in mixing drum and then balled in a balling drum by adding moisture. This mix is then provided in the surge hopper. The mix is next drawn from the hopper by the drum feeder fitted with suitable drive and passed through the screen type charging means. The passing of sinter mix through the screen type charging means is carried out by simultaneous movements of the plurality of rods in the grooves/stiffeners with defined gaps comprising the said screen type charging means. The alternate rods move in opposite direction driven by a suitable drive assembly. The alternate rods move horizontally in the grooves/stiffeners at defined arc length at an angle of 29 to 31 degrees, preferably 30degrees. The rods are spaced with increasing gap between them from top to bottom through which the sinter mix passes. Accordingly the sinter mix passes through smallest gap between the said rods at the beginning and the largest gap at the end. Thus the finer particles pass at the top, medium sized particles to the middle and the biggest particles to the bottom by the movement of the rods. This results in vertical segregation of sinter mix according to size with 40% of finer particles at top and 20% finer particles at the bottom layer. The vertical segregation of sinter mix is achieved by differential speed of the particles of different size acquired due to movement of the rods. The segregated sinter mix is collected on the sintering machine pallet to form uniform sinter bed.<br>
The present system segregates the sinter mix in a manner such that the high content carbon is in top layer of sinter mix forming the sinter bed. On segregation by the<br>
4<br><br>
system of the present invention the carbon percentage in the sinter mix varied from 4.75% to 4.26% from top to bottom<br>
The invention is now described with reference to non- limiting accompanying drawings<br>

Detailed Description Of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Fig 1 describes the conventional system for separation of sinter mix. It comprises surge hopper (1), drum feeder (2), sinter mix charging chute(3). The sinter mix charging chute is an inclined plate. There is a stabilizer plate(4) which guides the motion of rotary drum and a suspension screw (5) for holding the inclined plane in position. The sinter mix is fed at the top on the surge hopper and then is transferred to the rotary drum which causes the mix to be placed on the inclined at a speed. The mix is thus separated by the inclined plane.<br>
5<br><br>
Fig 2. The system of the present invention comprises surge hopper (1), drum feeder (2), screen type charging means for segregation of sinter mix (6). The screen consists of 32 No. of rods moving in opposite direction in the grooves/stiffeners (13 Nos) at an arc length of 0.73 m., 1.4 m. length and angle 30 degrees. Spacing between the stiffeners is kept at 250mm which is equivalent to the horizontal movement of the rod. Gap between the rods are so adjusted that the smallest gap i.e. 2mm between the rods at the top and 40 mm gap between the rods at the bottom. Horizontal movement of alternate rod in opposite direction in done with the help of suitable drive assembly. The total screen was supported by 4 nos. of screen.<br>
The screen type charging means for segregation of sinter mix is designed to handle the sinter mix feed rate up to 200 TPH as per plant conditions. This system involves one motor of 5HP and one warm reduction type gear box. 32 Nos. of stainless steel rods of diameter 20mm along with 13 Nos. of stiffener/guides to pass the rods. The system involves the movement of alternate rods in opposite direction to keep the rods and guides in clean condition. Design of the system is made such that it is easier to replace rods. The movement of rods were fixed for 250mm which is equivalent to the gap between the two guides.<br>
Spacing of rods are so adjusted that finer particles get screened at the beginning and coarser later with a rod spacing from 12 to 40 mm gap in progressive increasing order. Rod movement is done by motor connected to worm type gear box to avoid jamming of sinter mix for a flow rate of 200 TPH. Operation of system yielded in the following benefits. Percentage of -3mm fraction at the top is 40.8% where as in the bottom it is 20.8%.<br>
Carbon percentage in the sinter mix varied from top to bottom i.e. 4.73% at top and 4.26% in the bottom. This help in providing uniform heat<br>
Fig 3A provides the size separation of sinter mix on the bed height following separation by the system of the present invention. It is evident that the top layer has smaller particle while the bottom layer of the bed has the large sized particles. A: 15%, B: 18 %, C:19% D: 39%, E 9% denote the amount of particles of various size range present    in    the    input    of   the    sinter    mix    which    is    to    be    segregated.<br>
6<br><br>
Fig 3B provides the graphical representation of the segregation achieved by the present invention . The left hand side graph indicates the -3mm fraction along the bed height. It is evident that the top layer has 70% and the bottom layer has 10% of the fraction of the sinter mix. Thus the concentration of -3mm particles on top of the sinter bed is achieved. The amount of carbon in the mix is depicted graphical in the right hand side. It is found that in a scale of 0 to 8 the amount of carbon at the top layer is 8 while that at bottom layer is 4.5. Thus segregation of carbon content by present system is effective with highest amount at top and lowest at the bottom.<br>
Fig 4 graphically demonstrates the segregation of sinter mix particles along the bed height. It is observed that the smaller particles of 2 mm in size occupy the top layer of the sinter bed. The larger particles are segregated at the bottom of the bed where particles above 8mm are deposited. This indicates effective size segregation of sinter mix particles according to size.<br>
Fig 5 illustrates the segregation of-3mm particles in the sinter mix by conventional methods employing systems conventionally available. It is evident that the top layer has 28.7% of-3 mm sized particles while the bottom layer has 42% of those particles.<br>
Fig 6. illustrates the segregation of-3mm particles in the sinter mix employing system and process of the present invention. It is evident that after segregation the top layer of of the sinter bed has 47.5% of-3mm particles while the bottom layer has 25.9 % of such particles. Thus effective segregation of the -3mm particles are obtained with more of such particles on top of sinter bed and lesser at bottom. On comparing with fig 5 it would be evident that the segregation obtained by the system of the present invention is better than that of conventional one. There is progressively lesser amount of these smaller particles as we go from top to bottom of sinter bed height. Such vertical segregation is not available by the conventional systems following conventional processes. Moreover with smaller sized particles at top helps in better and uniform heat generation.<br>
Fig 7 demonstrates the carbon segregation obtained from the sinter mix separation by conventional methods using conventional systems. The amount of carbon content on top of sinter bed is 4.35% while at the bottom of the bed is 5.78%.<br>
7<br><br>
Fig 8 demonstrates the Carbon segregation obtained by segregation of sinter mix by the present system. It is observed that after segregation of the particles according to carbon content is achieved . The carbon content on the top layer of the sinter mix is 4.73% while that of the bottom layer is 4.26%. Thus there is a uniform segregation of carbon from top to bottom of the sinter bed using system of present invention. This provides uniform heat generation from the sinter mix.<br>
