				<td>SANITARY ABSORBENT ARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to disposable absorbent articles, such as<br>
sanitary napkins, parity liners, and the like that are adapted to be worn in a thong<br>
style undergarment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sanitary napkins having side flaps are disclosed in the literature and are<br>
commercially available in the marketplace. Generally, the flaps extend laterally from<br>
the side edges of a central absorbent structure and are intended to drape over the<br>
edges of the wearer's panties in the crotch region. Thus, the flaps are disposed<br>
between the edges of the wearer's panties in the crotch region and the wearer's<br>
thighs. Commonly, the flaps are provided with an attachment means for affixing the<br>
flaps to the underside of the wearer's panties.<br>
The flaps serve at least two purposes. First, the flaps prevent exudates<br>
from soiling the edges of the wearer's panties and second, the flaps, when affixed<br>
to the underside of the panties, help stabilize the napkin in the undergarment and<br>
prevent it shifting out of place. Typically, the flaps extend only from a central region<br>
of the sanitary napkin rather than along the entire length of the sanitary napkin.<br>
This enables the flaps to more easily conform to the curved contours of the crotch<br>
region of the undergarment. That is, since the crotch portion of an undergarment is<br>
curved, the length of the flaps cannot extend along the entire length of the napkin<br>
since they will not effectively wrap around the panty crotch.<br>
Sanitary napkins having flaps are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,478,<br>
entitled "Shaped Sanitary Napkin With Flaps", to Van Tilburg on Aug. 18, 1987,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,047, entitled "Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means", to Mattingly<br><br>
on Aug. 26, 1986, U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", to Van<br>
Tilburg on May 20, 1986, U.S. Pat. No. 4,285,343, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", to<br>
McNair on Aug. 25, 1981, U.S. Pat. No. 3,397,697, entitled "Disposable Sanitary<br>
Shield For Undergarments", to Rickard on Aug. 20, 1968, U.S. Pat. No. 2,787,271,<br>
entitled "Sanitary Napkin", to Clark on Apr. 2, 1957 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,320,<br>
entitled "Sanitary Napkin With Undergarment Gathering Flaps, to McCoy on Feb.<br>
13, 1990, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
As the wearing of thong style undergarments has recently increased, there<br>
has also been a need for disposable absorbent articles to be adapted to these<br>
types of undergarments. WO 00/72790 A1 discloses an absorbent article which is<br>
intended to be worn in a thong undergarment. The absorbent article has a wide<br>
end and an narrow end to conform to the shape of a thong undergarment and is<br>
provided with fastening tabs in the narrow end of the article. One of the problems<br>
with this design is that the narrow end of the absorbent article has a tendency to<br>
shift laterally as a wearer of the article moves. Due to its width, the rear section of<br>
the napkin is mechanically less stable than the wider rear section of a conventional<br>
sanitary napkin<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a sanitary napkin having<br>
flaps that is adapted for use in a thong style of women's undergarment.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there has been provided a sanitary napkin<br>
adapted to be worn in a thong undergarment comprising a central absorbent pad,<br>
the central absorbent pad having a liquid pervious cover layer, a liquid impervious<br>
barrier layer and an absorbent core between the cover layer and barrier layer. The<br>
sanitary napkin has a pair of opposite longitudinal side edges defining<br>
therebetween a width dimension, a first transverse end and an opposite second<br>
transverse end defining therebetween a length dimension. The sanitary napkin has<br><br>
a longitudinal centeriine, a lateral centerline, a first distal end region, an opposite<br>
second distal end region and a central region intermediate the first distal end region<br>
and the second distal end region. The sanitary napkin further having a flap<br>
extending laterally outward from each longitudinal side edge in the central region<br>
along a line of juncture, the line of juncture defining the length of the central region,<br>
each flap being adapted to fold over a crotch portion of the thong undergarment in<br>
use. The width of the absorbent core varies along at least a portion of the length of<br>
the absorbent core such that the width of the absorbent core in the second distal<br>
end region has a maximum value that is greater than a maximum value of the width<br>
of the absorbent core in the first distal end region. The absorbent core in the first<br>
distal end region has a length measured intermediate the central region and the first<br>
transverse end, wherein the maximum value of the width of the absorbent core in<br>
the first distal end region does not exceed 40 mm along any portion of the length of<br>
the first distal end region, the width of the absorbent core in the first distal end<br>
region does not exceed 30 mm along at least one half of the length of the first distal<br>
end region and wherein a ratio of the length of the first distal end region to the<br>
maximum width of the absorbent core in the first distal end region is less than 2.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will be more readily<br>
apparent when considered in reference to the following description and when taken<br>
in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however,<br>
that the drawings are provided for purposes of illustration only and not as a<br>
definition of the boundaries of the invention, for which reference should be made to<br>
the appending claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to sanitary napkins adapted to be worn in a<br>
crotch portion of a wearer's thong style undergarment in use. The napkin comprises<br>
a central absorbent pad having a liquid pervious cover layer, a liquid impervious<br>
barrier layer and an absorbent core between the cover layer and barrier layer. The<br>
central absorbent pad will generally have an absorbent capacity sufficient to absorb<br>
the anticipated total amount of menstrual fluid. Central absorbent pad, is preferably<br>
thin, i.e. less than about 5 mm in caliper, preferably between about 2.5 mm and<br>
about 4 mm. It has been found that a sanitary napkin having a narrow, thin<br>
absorbent core is extremely comfortable to the user.<br>
The sanitary napkin has a longitudinal centertine, a lateral centeriine, a pair<br>
of opposite longitudinal side edges defining therebetween a width dimension, a pair<br>
of opposite transverse ends including a first transverse end and an opposite second<br>
transverse end defining therebetween a length dimension. The sanitary napkin is<br><br><br>
provided with side flaps which extend along a line of juncture from the longitudinal<br>
side edges, the line of juncture defining a central region of the sanitary napkin. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, one flap extends from each respective longitudinal side<br>
edge. The side flaps are adapted to be folded over the edges of a crotch portion of<br>
the wearer's undergarment in use. Each flap extends laterally outward from each<br>
longitudinal side edge along a line of juncture. The length of the line of juncture<br>
defines the length of the central region of the sanitary napkin. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, each flap has substantially the identical shape and size as the<br>
opposite flap and each flap is spaced equidistant from a respective transverse end,<br>
i.e. they have a symmetrical orientation. In an embodiment (not shown) where the<br>
flaps are affixed to the sanitary napkin in an asymmetric orientation, the length of<br>
the central region is measured from the flap being closer to a respective transverse<br>
end region, i.e. the line of juncture being closest to the transverse end region.<br>
The sanitary napkin further includes a first distal end region and an opposite<br>
second distal end region, the central region being intermediate the first distal end<br>
region and the second distal end region. Since the flaps define the central region,<br>
they also accordingly define the first and second distal end regions. More specifically,<br>
the first distal end region has a length that extends from the central region to the first<br>
transverse end. Similarly, the second distal end region has a length that extends from<br>
the central region to the second transverse end. Thus, the first distal end region has a<br>
length as measured along the longitudinal centerline from the first distal end to a line<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline at the end of the flap nearest the first distal<br>
end to the first distal end. Similarly, the length of the second distal end region is<br>
measured from a line perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline from the flap nearest<br>
the second distal end to the second distal end.<br>
The absorbent core has two opposite side edges defining therebetween a<br>
width of the absorbent core. The width of the absorbent core varies along at least a<br>
portion of its length. The width of the absorbent core in the second distal end<br><br>
region has a maximum value that is greater than a maximum value of the width of<br>
the absorbent core in the first distal end region. Each side edge is inward from and<br>
in close proximity to a respective longitudinal side edge of the sanitary napkin. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIGURE 1, the side edges of the absorbent<br>
core extend obliquely with respect to the longitudinal centeriine and taper from the<br>
wider second distal end region to the narrower first distal end region. In a most<br>
preferred embodiment, the width of the absorbent core continuously tapers from a<br>
maximum width adjacent the central region to a minimum width adjacent the first<br>
distal end.<br>
As used herein, the term "sanitary napkin" refers to an article which is worn<br>
by females in an undergarment adjacent to the pudendal region and which is<br>
intended to absorb and contain the various exudates which are discharged from the<br>
body (e.g., blood menses, and urine) and which is intended to be discarded after a<br>
single use (i.e., it is not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused).<br>
A specific example of implementation of a sanitary napkin according to the<br>
present invention is illustrated in FIGURE 1. The sanitary napkin designated by the<br>
reference numeral 10 basically comprises a main body represented by central<br>
absorbent pad 12. The central absorbent pad 12 has an imaginary longitudinal<br>
centeriine 80, an imaginary lateral centeriine 85, a pair of opposite longitudinal side<br>
edges 90, 90', a first distal end 93 and an opposite second distal end 95 and a<br>
central region 94, intermediate the distal ends.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURE 2, topsheet 14 and backsheet 18 are joined at<br>
 seam as (also commonly referred to as a flange seal) around the entire periphery of<br>
sanitary napkin 10. The purpose of this seam is to unite the various elements of the<br>
sanitary napkin into a unitary structure. Seam 39 can be formed by any means<br>
commonly used in the art for this purpose such as by gluing, crimping, or heat-<br>
sealing. Seam 39 is illustrated extending completely around the periphery of<br><br>
sanitary napkin 10; this is a suitable embodiment for ease of construction.<br>
However, other means of uniting the various elements can be used. The central<br>
absorbent pad 12 comprises absorbent core 16, topsheet 14 and backsheet 18,<br>
wherein backsheet 18 is disposed on a side of absorbent core 16 that is opposite<br>
that of topsheet 14.<br>
Topsheet 14 is liquid permeable and, when sanitary napkin 10 is in use, is in<br>
close proximity to the skin of the user. Topsheet 14 is compliant, soft feeling, and<br>
non-irritating to the user's skin. It can be made from any of the materials<br>
conventional for this type of use. Non-limiting examples of suitable materials that<br>
can be used as topsheet 14 are woven and nonwoven fabrics formed from<br>
polyester, polypropylene, nylon, and/or rayon fibers or the topsheet may be an<br>
apertured thermo-plastic film. Apertured formed films are preferred for topsheet 14<br>
because they are pervious to liquids and yet non-absorbent. Thus, the surface of<br>
the formed film that is in contact with the body remains dry and is more comfortable<br>
to the wearer.<br>
Backsheet 18 is impervious to liquids and, thus, prevents menstrual fluid<br>
from soiling the clothing of the user. Any material used in the art for such purpose<br>
can be utilized herein. Suitable materials include embossed or non embossed<br>
polyethylene films and laminated tissue.<br>
Absorbent core 16 provides the means for absorbing menstrual fluid.<br>
Absorbent core 16 is generally compressible, comfortable and non-irritating to the<br>
user's skin. It can comprise any material used in the art for such purpose.<br>
Examples include comminuted wood pulp that is generally referred to as airfelt,<br>
creped cellulose wadding, absorbent foams, absorbent sponges, absorbent<br>
hydrogel materials, polymeric fibers, or any equivalent material or combinations of<br>
materials. In a preferred embodiment, as shown in Figure 1, the absorbent core 16<br><br>
is wider in the second distal end 95 and tapers continuously towards the first distal<br>
end 93.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, the portion of the outer surface of<br>
backsheet 18 that is generally in vertical registration with absorbent core 16 is<br>
provided with central absorbent pad adhesive 20. Central absorbent pad adhesive<br>
20 provides an adhesive attachment means for securing central absorbent pad 12<br>
to the crotch portion of a undergarment. Any adhesive or glue used in the art for<br>
such purpose can be used herein, with pressure-sensitive adhesive being<br>
preferred. Suitable adhesives are Century A-305IV manufactured by the Century<br>
Adhesives Corporation and Instant LOK 34-2823 manufactured by National Starch<br>
Company. The central absorbent pad adhesive may be the same width as<br>
absorbent core, or as shown in Figure 3 it may be a plurality of relatively narrow<br>
stripes. However, the width is not critical and appropriate widths, as well as lengths,<br>
can be readily selected by those skilled in the art. The pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
of central absorbent pad adhesive 20 should be covered with central absorbent pad<br>
liner 22 to keep the adhesive from drying out and to keep it from sticking to<br>
extraneous surfaces prior to use. Any commercially available release liner<br>
commonly used for such purposes can be used herein. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
suitable release liners are BL30MG-A SILOXE1/0 and BL 30 MG-A SILOX 4/P/O<br>
both of which are manufactured by the Akrosil Corporation.<br>
As can be observed from the foregoing, central absorbent pad 12 comprises<br>
an absorbent core having an upper surface covered by a fluid pervious body<br>
contacting surface (represented in FIGURE 2 by topsheet 14) and an opposed<br>
liquid impervious surface (represented in FIGURE 2 by backsheet 18). It is to be<br>
understood that the embodiment illustrated is only one possible embodiment. Other<br>
possible embodiments include one in which an absorbent core is essentially<br>
completely wrapped with topsheet before it is placed on a backsheet. The<br>
absorbent core can also comprise an absorbent layer which possesses sufficient<br><br>
integrity to stand-alone and which is fluid permeable on one surface while the other<br>
surface has been treated to render it liquid impervious.<br>
It should be noted that a relatively narrow central absorbent pad 12 is<br>
effective because the overall configuration and use of sanitary napkin 10 results in<br>
central absorbent pad 12 being maintained in close proximity to the body. Such<br>
proximity of central absorbent pad 12 places it precisely where it should be: very<br>
near the body at the vaginal opening. Central absorbent pad 12 can then absorb<br>
the vast majority of the menstrual fluid (menses) before it has an opportunity to flow<br>
along the central absorbent pad 12. As shown in Figure 1, the absorbent core 16 is<br>
generally tapered from a relatively wide second distal end region to a relatively<br>
narrow opposite first distal end region so as to conform generally to the wearer's<br>
thighs and to be easily conformable to thong undergarment styles.<br>
Although the side edges are shown to continuously converge towards the<br>
longitudinal centeriine along the length of the sanitary napkin, such is not, per se,<br>
critical to the invention provided of course that the first distal end region has a<br>
relatively narrow width that is adapted to be comfortably worn in a thong<br>
undergarment. Thus, in alternative embodiments (not shown) the width of the<br>
absorbent core can vary along the length of the napkin or alternatively the width<br>
may be constant over a considerable length of the sanitary napkin (i.e. wherein the<br>
side edges are substantially parallel. However, in every embodiment of the present<br>
invention, at least a portion of the absorbent core in the second distill end region<br>
has a maximum width that is greater than a maximum width of the absorbent core<br>
in the first distal end region.<br>
The width of the wider second distal end is generally less than about 75<br>
mm, preferably from about 70 mm to 60 mm. The width of the absorbent core (and<br>
concomitantly the width of the sanitary napkin) preferably continuously tapers from<br>
the second distal end toward the first distal end, the absorbent core in the first distal<br><br>
end having a maximum width of less than 40 mm, preferably less than about 30<br>
mm along at least one half of a continuous length of the first distal end region, and<br>
more preferably the width is between about 15 to 20 mm along a substantial portion<br>
of the length of the first distal end region. While the taper is illustrated as being a<br>
substantially straight line, other variations are considered to be within the scope of<br>
the present invention such as curved or arcuate lines. It is considered an important<br>
feature of the present invention that the length of the first distal end region (as<br>
measured from the flap to the transverse end of the napkin) does not greatly<br>
exceed the maximum width of the first distal end region. Accordingly, the ratio of<br>
the length of the first distal end region to the maximum width of the absorbent core<br>
in the first distal end region is less than 2, preferably the ratio is less than 1.5 and<br>
most preferably the ratio is about 1.25. In a preferred embodiment, the maximum<br>
width of the absorbent core in the second distal end is between 60 mm to 75 mm,<br>
and is more preferably about 70 mm. It is also considered an important feature of<br>
the present invention that the absorbent core has a maximum width in the first distal<br>
end region that does not exceed 40 mm along any portion of the length of the first<br>
distal end region and does not exceed 30 mm along at least one half of the length<br>
of the first distal end region. Preferably the width of the absorbent core adjacent<br>
the first transverse end is less than the width of the absorbent core adjacent the<br>
flap.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2, the sanitary napkin 10 has two flaps 24<br>
and 24' extending laterally outward from the longitudinal side edges of the central<br>
absorbent pad 12 and define the central region of the sanitary napkin. As used<br>
herein, the terminology "central region" and "lateral centerline" refer generally to a<br>
region of the central absorbent pad 12 that is intended to be placed in a crotch<br>
portion of a wearer's undergarment and is adapted to be in vertical registration with<br>
the labia majora of the wearer in use. Thus, for some embodiments of the invention<br>
wherein the sanitary napkin is asymmetrical, such as in a product intended for<br>
overnight use, the central region and lateral centerline may not be located in the<br><br>
exact geometric center of the central absorbent pad. Nevertheless, the central<br>
region of the sanitary napkin is adapted to be in vertical registration with the labia<br>
majora of the wearer in use. While it is not necessary that the flaps be mirror<br>
images of one another they preferably are. Topsheet 14 forms one surface of flaps<br>
24, 24' while backsheet 18 forms the other surface. In general, the flaps do not<br>
require a topsheet to enable them to function properly, but the use of a topsheet is<br>
preferred. Flap topsheet can be integral with the central absorbent body, as<br>
illustrated, or it can be an independent element; the former being preferred. All of<br>
the specific physical properties of the topsheet 14 previously described, apply to<br>
any flap topsheet that is used. There is, however, no requirement that the flap<br>
topsheet be the same material as the topsheet associated with the central<br>
absorbent pad. In one possible embodiment, the flap topsheet may be nonwoven<br>
material while the topsheet over the central absorbent pad is an apertured<br>
polymeric film. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, backsheet 18 serves as a<br>
backsheet for flaps 24 and 24'. The flaps require a backsheet (or more generally, a<br>
liquid impervious materials) to enable them to function property. The flap backsheet<br>
can be integral with the absorbent core liquid impervious surface or they can be<br>
independent elements. All of the specific physical properties of the backsheet 18<br>
previously described apply to the flap backsheet.<br>
At least a portion of the outer, garment faceable surface of flap 24, in a<br>
region adjacent distal edge 78, is coated with flap adhesive 36. Flap adhesive 36 is<br>
an adhesive attachment means which is used to assist in maintaining flap 24 in<br>
position after it is wrapped around the edge of the crotch portion of the<br>
undergarment as described below. Any adhesive used for central absorbent pad<br>
adhesive 20 can be used as flap adhesive 36. Also, flap adhesive 36 is covered<br>
with a removable flap release liner 38. Any release liner material used for central<br>
absorbent pad release liner 22 can be used for flap release liner 38. The proximal<br>
edge of each flap 24, 24' is associated with central absorbent pad 12 along a line of<br>
juncture 26. As used herein, the term "line of juncture" refers to any of various<br><br>
curved or straight lines. The line of juncture is typically greater than 5 cm,<br>
preferably between 5 cm and 10 cm. Each flap 24, 24' has a distal edge 78 that is<br>
remote from the proximal edge (which is defined by the line of juncture 26). It is to<br>
be observed that lines of juncture 26 and 26' are the lines along which flaps 24 and<br>
24' are associated with the absorbent core (represented by central absorbent pad<br>
12); as such they represent lines of demarcation between the absorbent core and<br>
the flaps.<br>
The sanitary napkin shown in FIGURE 1 has a substantially linear line of<br>
juncture 26. The precise shape of flap 24, as well as the overall shape of the<br>
sanitary napkin 10 can be selected by those skilled in the art without undue<br>
experimentation. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 1, the flaps are<br>
symmetrically disposed along the longitudinal edge of the sanitary napkin.<br>
The sanitary napkin of the present invention, such as the one illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 - 3, is utilized by removing the release liners 22 and 38 and 38' and<br>
thereafter placing the sanitary napkin in a undergarment. The center region of<br>
central absorbent pad 12 is placed in crotch portion (not shown) of the<br>
undergarment with one end of central absorbent pad 12 extending towards the front<br>
section of the undergarment and the other end towards the back section and with<br>
the backsheet 18 in contact with the inner surface of center crotch portion of the<br>
undergarment. Central absorbent pad adhesive 20 maintains central absorbent<br>
pad 12 in position. The distal portions of flaps 24 and 24' are folded around,<br>
respectively, side edges and of the crotch portion of the undergarment. Flap<br>
adhesive 36 and 36' secure flaps 24 and 24' in such position, thus, flaps 24 and 24'<br>
are each folded over themselves with a portion of the undergarment.<br>
FIGURES 4-6 illustrate another embodiment of the present invention<br>
wherein the same reference numerals identify the same elements as in FIGURES<br>
1-3. In accordance with this embodiment, as shown in Figure 4, the sanitary napkin<br><br>
10 is provided with two flaps on each longitudinal side edge, one flap being in the<br>
central region and one flap being in the first distal end region. The absorbent core<br>
16 is wider in the second distal end 95 and tapers continuously towards the first<br>
distal end 93. By tapering the absorbent core 16 yet maintaining substantially the<br>
same width of the other components in the central absorbent pad 12, a pair of<br>
opposite preferential bending edges 30, 30' are formed along the edges of the<br>
absorbent core in the region from at least the central region 94 to the first distal end<br>
93.<br>
It is to be observed that lines of juncture 26 and 26' are the lines along which<br>
flaps 24 and 24' are associated with the absorbent core (represented by central<br>
absorbent pad 12); as such they represent lines of demarcation between the<br>
absorbent core and the flaps. In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 3, the lines<br>
of juncture 26, 26' are coincident with the preferential bending lines 30, 30 in the<br>
central region 94 of the central absorbent pad 12.<br><br>
