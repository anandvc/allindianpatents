				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPOSITION, TRANSFER SHEET, MELAMINE<br>
DECORATIVE BOARD, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING<br>
MELAMINE DECORATIVE BOARD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a composition, a<br>
transfer sheet, a melamine decorative board, and a<br>
method for producing the melamine decorative<br>
board.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A melamine decorative board is used as a<br>
horizontal surface for a counter, a desk, and others<br>
because of its excellent properties in surface<br>
hardness, heat resistance, abrasion resistance and<br>
the like. The melamine decorative board is<br>
generally obtained by stacking a melamine resin<br>
impregnated pattern paper and a phenol resin<br>
impregnated core paper, and then applying heat and<br>
pressure to the stacked papers with a flat plate<br>
pressing machine (see Patent Documents 1 -3). The<br>
melamine resin impregnated pattern paper is<br>
obtained by impregnating a pattern base paper for<br>
decorative board with a resin liquid composed<br>
primarily of melamine-formaldehyde resin and<br>
drying the impregnated pattern base paper. The<br>
phenol resin impregnated core paper is obtained by-<br>
impregnating a kraft paper with a resin liquid<br>
composed primarily of phenol-formaldehyde resin<br>
and drying the impregnated kraft paper.<br>

Publication No. H06-199528<br>
Patent Document 2: Unexamined Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 2005-199495<br>
Patent Document 3: Unexamined Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 2005-146272<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The melamine decorative board has excellent<br>
surface hardness, heat resistance, abrasion<br>
resistance and the like by virtue of characteristics<br>
of the resin used therein. On the other hand, the<br>
melamine decorative board is disadvantageous in<br>
that a greasy dirt such as a sebum membrane of a<br>
fingerprint (hereinafter referred to as a fingerprint)<br>
adhering onto a surface of the melamine decorative<br>
board is easily noticeable. A further disadvantage<br><br>
is that a pattern on a printed paper cannot be<br>
clearly exhibited due to reflection of lights and<br>
white blur on a melamine resin layer.<br>
[0004] The present invention was made in order to<br>
overcome such conventional disadvantages. It is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a<br>
composition which can be used in producing a<br>
melamine decorative board on which a fingerprint<br>
and the like is less noticeable and a pattern on a<br>
printed paper can be clearly exhibited; a transfer<br>
sheet which can be used in producing the melamine<br>
decorative board; the melamine decorative board;<br>
and a method for producing the melamine decorative<br>
board.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0005] A composition of the present invention includes<br>
(a) an organosilica sol; and (b1) a siloxane<br>
graft-type polymer obtained by compositing fluorine<br>
resin or acrylic resin with siloxane and/or (b2) a<br>
cold glass coating agent.<br>
[0006] In other words, there are three different types<br>
of the composition in the present invention, that is,<br>
a composition including the component (a) and the<br>
component (bl), a composition including the<br><br>
component (a) and the component (b2), and a<br>
composition including the component (a), the<br>
component (b1), and the component (b2).<br>
[0007] The composition of the present invention can be<br>
used, for example, for forming a low refractive index<br>
layer composed of a cured product of the composition<br>
of the present invention on a surface of a melamine<br>
decorative board. In the melamine decorative<br>
board having the low refractive index layer, which is<br>
composed of the cured product of the composition of<br>
the present invention, formed on the surface thereof,<br>
a fingerprint adhering on the surface is less<br>
noticeable. This is because the low refractive<br>
index layer has a lower refractive index than that of<br>
a melamine resin layer and, therefore, a refractive<br>
index difference between an adhering fingerprint<br>
and the low refractive index layer is smaller than<br>
that between an adhering fingerprint and the<br>
melamine resin layer. Furthermore, the low<br>
refractive index layer has a low reflectivity and a<br>
low refractive index, thereby reducing reflection of<br>
lights and white blur. As a result, a pattern on a<br>
printed paper used for the melamine decorative<br>
board can be clearly exhibited to provide the<br>
melamine decorative board with high design quality.<br><br>
[0008] In the decorative board of the present invention,<br>
since the low refractive index layer composed of the<br>
cured product of the above-described composition is<br>
formed on the surface, the fingerprint adhering on<br>
the surface is less noticeable, and the pattern on the<br>
printed paper is clearly exhibited, whereby the high<br>
design quality is realized. The low refractive index<br>
layer preferably has a refractive index of 1.5 or less.<br>
By setting the refractive index to 1.5 or less, the<br>
fingerprint becomes still less noticeable and the<br>
pattern on the printed paper is exhibited more<br>
clearly.<br>
[0009] A transfer sheet of the present invention<br>
includes a base material and the above-described<br>
composition disposed on the base material. The<br>
transfer sheet can be used for forming the low<br>
refractive index layer on the surface of the<br>
melamine decorative board. The transfer sheet<br>
makes it easy to form the low refractive index layer.<br>
[0010] A method for producing the melamine decorative<br>
board of the present invention includes steps of<br>
stacking the above-described transfer sheet, a<br>
melamine resin impregnated paper, and a core<br>
material, applying heat and pressure thereto, and<br>
removing the base material of the transfer sheet.<br><br>
According to the method, the melamine decorative<br>
board having the low refractive index layer on the<br>
surface thereof can be easily produced. While<br>
applying heat and pressure, temperature is<br>
preferably in a range of 110-180°C, and pressure is<br>
preferably in a range of 5-10 MPa.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in detail. A siloxane graft-type polymer<br>
(a component (b1)) used in a composition of the<br>
present invention is obtained by compositing<br>
fluorine resin or acrylic resin with siloxane.<br>
Specifically, the siloxane graft-type polymer can be<br>
obtained by copolymerizing following components:<br>
(A) 2-70% by weight of organic solvent-soluble<br>
fluorine resin having radical polymerizable<br>
unsaturated bond via urethane bond, (B) 4-40% by<br>
weight of polysiloxane which is radical<br>
polymerizable at one end shown by a following<br>
formula 1 (wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or<br>
a hydrocarbon group having 1-10 carbon atoms; R2,<br>
R3, R4, R5, and R6, which may be mutually same or<br>
different, represent a hydrogen atom or a<br><br>
hydrocarbon group having 1-10 carbon atoms,' and n<br>
represents an integer of 2 or more), and/or<br>
polysiloxane which is radical polymerizable at one<br>
end shown by a following formula 2 (wherein R7<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group<br>
having 1-10 carbon atoms; R8, R9, R10, R11, and R12,<br>
which may be mutually same or different, represent<br>
a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1-10<br>
carbon atoms; p represents an integer of 0-10; and q<br>
represents an integer of 2 or more), and (C) 15-94%<br>
by weight of radical polymerizable monomer which is<br>
unreactive to the component (A) under radical<br>
polymerization reaction condition, except<br>
polymerization reaction with a double bond.<br>
[0014] [Formula 1]<br><br>
[0015] [Formula 2]<br><br>
Another example of the siloxane graft-type<br>
polymer obtained by compositing fluorine resin or<br>
acrylic resin with siloxane includes a polymer which<br>
is obtained by copolymerizing following components:<br>
(A) 2-70% by weight of organic solvent-soluble<br>
fluorine resin having radical polymerizable<br>
unsaturated bond via urethane bond, (B) 5-55% by<br>
weight of polysiloxane which is radical<br>
polymerizable at one end shown by the above<br>
formula 1, and/or poly siloxane which is radical<br>
polymerizable at one end shown by the above<br>
formula 2, (C) 5-55% by weight of monomer having<br>
an alkoxysilyl group, (D) 15-50% by weight of<br>
monomer having a hydroxyl group, and (E) 0-73% by<br>
weight of monomer having a functional group which<br>
is unreactive to the above components (A)-(D) except<br>
radical polymerization.<br>
[0016] Still another example of the siloxane graft-type<br>
polymer obtained by compositing fluorine resin or<br>
acrylic resin with siloxane includes a polymer in<br>
which an acrylic-type (co)polymer containing a<br>
curable group, having radical polymerizable<br>
unsaturated bond via urethane bond and also being<br>
soluble in organic solvent, is used in place of the<br>
component (A) in each of the above-described<br>
siloxane graft-type polymers.<br>
[0017] Commercially available siloxane graft-type<br>
polymer obtained by compositing fluorine resin or<br>
acrylic resin with siloxane includes ZX-007C,<br>
ZX-001, ZX-022, ZX-022H, ZX-028R, ZX-036 (all are<br>
manufactured by Fuji Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) and the<br>
like.<br>
[0018] A cold glass coating agent (a component (b2))<br>
used in the composition of the present invention<br>
includes one which is obtained by ionizing<br>
alcohol-soluble organosilicon compound in a<br>
solution composed of water and organic solvent, and<br>
adding thereto halogen and boron as catalysts.<br>
[0019] A role of B3+ ion is to inhibit a decrease in an<br>
amount of SiO2 due to generation and volatilization<br>
of SiF6 by reacting with F- ion. B3+ ion reacts with<br>
F- ion to generate BF4- complex ion, and B in the<br>
BF4- complex ion is replaced extremely easily by Si<br>
in Si(OR)n to obtain SiF-n + 1 complex ion.<br>
Hydrolysis and dehydrating condensation<br>
represented by the formulae below are accelerated,<br>
and as a result, metal-oxide glass is obtained at an<br>
ambient temperature range. Residual B3+ ion is<br>
vaporized and disappears as B(OCH3)3 by the<br>
presence of methanol (CH3 +), and F- ion is vaporized<br>
and disappears as HF by catalytic reaction with OH"<br>
group or others contained in the base material and<br>
the like. Here, R represents an alkyl group, M<br>
represents a metal, and X represents halogen.<br>
[0020] <br>
An example of a compound releasing boron ion<br>
B3+ includes, for example, trialkoxyboran B(OR)3,<br>
among which triethoxyboran B(OEt)3 is preferable.<br>
Concentration of B3+ ion in a reaction solution is<br>
preferably in a range of l.0-10.0 mol/liter. Halogen<br>
ion is preferably F , Cl-, or a mixture of F- and Cl-.<br>
A compound used as halogen ion source may be any<br>
one which produces F- ion or Cl- ion in the reaction<br>
solution. As F- ion source, for example, ammonium<br>
hydrogen fluoride NH4F.HF, sodium fluoride NaF,<br>
and the like are preferable. As Cl- ion source, for<br>
example, ammonium chloride NH4Cl and the like are<br>
preferable.<br>
[0021] Commercially available cold glass coating agent<br>
includes Siragusital A6200, Siragusital B4373(BN)<br>
(both are manufactured by Bokuto Kasei Kogyo Co.,<br>
Ltd.), and the like.<br>
[0022] An organosilica sol used in the composition of<br>
the present invention includes, for example, a<br>
colloidal solution including colloidal silicas with a<br>
particle diameter of 1-40 nm (more preferably with a<br>
diameter of 7-30 nm) stably dispersed in organic<br>
solution. A silica concentration is preferably in a<br>
range of 1-50% by weight, more preferably 40% by<br>
weight or less to inhibit gelation.<br>
[0023] Commercially available organosilica sol<br>
includes IPA-ST, IPA-ST-ZL, methanol silica sol,<br>
NPC-ST-30, EG-ST, DMAC-ST and the like<br>
manufactured by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.;<br>
OSCAL manufactured by Shokubai Kasei Kogyo Co.,<br>
Ltd.; Quartron (registered trademark)<br>
manufactured by Fuse Chemical Co., Ltd.; Highlink<br>
(registered trademark) OG Silica Organosol<br>
manufactured by Clariant Japan K.K.; and the like.<br>
[0024] In the composition of the present invention, it is<br>
preferable to use an organosilica sol obtained by<br>
substituting an aqueous silica sol using a<br>
hydrophilic solvent such as alcohol and the like. In<br>
the organosilica sol derived from the aqueous silica<br>
sol, an amount of hydroxyl groups on a surface of the<br>
silica becomes sufficient. Therefore, when the low<br>
refractive index layer of the melamine decorative<br>
board is formed using the composition of the present<br>
invention, adhesion between the low refractive<br>
index layer and the melamine layer is promoted, and<br>
surface durability of the melamine decorative board<br>
is thereby improved. When the organosilica sol is<br>
dispersed in a hydrophobic solvent, a surface of the<br>
organosilica sol is hydrophobized in order to<br>
stabilize the organosilica sol. In such an<br>
organosilica sol, the silica does not have a sufficient<br>
amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface thereof,<br>
and adhesion between the low refractive index layer<br>
and the melamine layer is likely to be inferior.<br>
[0025] Here, the hydrophilic (polar) solvent refers to a<br>
solvent having an affinity with water. An example<br>
thereof is a hydrophilic organic solvent including, in<br>
a molecule thereof, a hydrophilic group such as a<br>
hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbonyl group<br>
and the like. The hydrophilic (polar) solvent<br>
includes a protic polar solvent and an aprotic polar<br>
solvent. Specific examples of the protic polar<br>
solvent include alcohol-based solvent such as methyl<br>
alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene<br>
dialcohol, propanol and the like; and<br>
cellosolve-based solvent such as methyl cellosolve,<br>
ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, n-propyl<br>
cellosolve and the like. Specific examples of the<br>
aprotic polar solvent include acetone, dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF),<br>
pyridine and the like.<br>
[0026] In the composition of the present invention, it is<br>
preferable to set a mixing ratio between the<br>
component (a) and the component (b1) so that an<br>
amount of the component (a) is 4-18 parts by weight<br>
(in solid equivalent) per part by weight of the<br>
component (bl) (in solid equivalent). By setting<br>
the amount of the component (a) to 4 or more parts<br>
by weight, the amount of hydroxyl groups on the<br>
surface of the silica becomes sufficient. Thus, the<br>
adhesion between the low refractive index layer and<br>
the melamine layer is promoted, and the surface<br>
durability of the melamine decorative board is<br>
thereby improved. Further, by setting the amount<br>
of the component (a) to 18 or less parts by weight,<br>
the amount of the component (bl) does not become<br>
too small. As a result, on a surface of the melamine<br>
decorative board, a fingerprint becomes still less<br>
noticeable, and a pattern on a printed paper becomes<br>
still clearer.<br>

[0028] Examples of base material used as a transfer<br>
sheet of the present invention include a plastic film<br>
and a metallic foil. As a plastic film, for example, a<br>
polyester film, a polyethylene film, a polypropylene<br>
film, a cellophane, a diacetylcellulose film, a<br>
triacetylcellulose film, an acetylcellulose butyrate<br>
film, a polyvinyl chloride film, a polyvinylidene<br>
chloride film, a polyvinyl alcohol film, an ethylene<br>
vinyl alcohol film, a polystyrene film, a<br>
polycarbonate film, a polymethylpentene film, a<br>
polysulfone film, a polyether ketone film, a<br>
polyether sulfone film, a polyetherimide film, a<br>
polyimide film, a fluororesin film, a nylon film, an<br>
acrylic film and the like can be used.<br>
[0029] As a metallic foil, for example, a gold foil, a<br>
silver foil, a copper foil, a zinc foil, an indium foil,<br>
an aluminum foil, a tin foil, an iron foil (including a<br>
stainless steel (SUS) foil), a titanium foil and the<br>
like can be used.<br>
[0030] The transfer sheet of the present invention can<br>
be produced, for example, by applying the<br>
composition to the base material. As an applying<br>
method, known methods, for example, a spray coat<br>
method, a gravure coat method, a bar coat method, a<br>
knife coat method, a roll coat method, a blade coat<br>
method, a die coat method, a curtain coat method, a<br>
reverse coat method, a comma coat method and the<br>
like can be employed. The transfer sheet obtained<br>
through such methods is stacked on a melamine<br>
resin impregnated paper (e.g., a melamine resin<br>
impregnated pattern paper and a melamine resin<br>
impregnated overlay paper) so that a<br>
composition-applied surface comes in contact with<br>
the melamine resin impregnated paper. Then, heat<br>
and pressure are applied to the stacked transfer<br>
sheet and the melamine resin impregnated paper<br>
together with a core material.<br>
[0031] A thickness (after dried) of the low refractive<br>
index layer formed using the composition of the<br>
present invention is preferably in a range of 0.5-15<br>
pm when the composition is composed of the<br>
component (a) and the component (b1). By setting<br>
the thickness within this range, a refractive index of<br>
the low refractive index layer easily becomes 1.5 or<br>
less. By setting the film thickness to 0.5 pm or<br>
more, the fingerprint becomes still less noticeable,<br>
and the pattern on the printed paper becomes still<br>
clearer on the surface of the melamine decorative<br>
board. Further, by setting the film thickness to 15<br>
pm or less, whitening of the low refractive layer is<br>
less likely to occur, and an appearance of the<br>
melamine decorative board becomes excellent.<br>
[0032] The thickness (after dried) of the low refractive<br>
index layer formed using the composition of the<br>
present invention is preferably in a range of 0.5-15<br>
um when the composition is composed of the<br>
component (a) and the component (b2). By setting<br>
the thickness within this range, the refractive index<br>
of the low refractive index layer easily becomes 1.5<br>
or less. By setting the film thickness to 0.5 µm or<br>
more, the fingerprint becomes still less noticeable,<br>
and the pattern on the printed paper becomes still<br>
clearer on the surface of the melamine decorative<br>
board. Further, by setting the film thickness to 15<br>
um or less, whitening of the low refractive layer is<br>
less likely to occur, and the appearance of the<br>
melamine decorative board becomes excellent.<br>
[0033] In the melamine decorative board of the present<br>
invention and a method for producing the melamine<br>
decorative board of the present invention, the<br>
melamine resin impregnated paper (the melamine<br>
resin impregnated pattern paper) may be used. The<br>
melamine resin impregnated paper is obtained, for<br>
example, by impregnating a decorative paper for use<br>
in a decorative board with a resin liquid composed<br>
primarily of melamine-formaldehyde resin and<br>
drying the impregnated decorative paper. A basis<br>
weight of the decorative paper for use in a<br>
decorative board is preferably, for example, in a<br>
range of about 80-140 g/m2. A degree of<br>
impregnation of the resin liquid, which is defined by<br>
a following mathematical formula 1, is preferably in<br>
a range of 70-160%, for example.<br>
[0034] [Mathematical formula 1]<br><br>
In the melamine decorative board of the present<br>
invention and the method for producing the<br>
melamine decorative board of the present invention,<br>
in order to improve abrasion resistance on the<br>
surface of the melamine decorative board, the<br>
melamine resin impregnated overlay paper may be<br>
stacked as an uppermost layer (excluding the low<br>
refractive index layer) and heat and pressure may be<br>
applied to the stacked body. The melamine resin<br>
impregnated overlay paper is obtained, for example,<br>
by impregnating an overlay base paper having a<br>
basis weight of about 20-60 g/m2 with a resin liquid<br>
composed primarily of melamine-formaldehyde resin<br>
at a degree of impregnation of 200-400%, and drying<br>
the impregnated overlay base paper.<br>
[003 5] In the melamine decorative board of the present<br>
invention and the method for producing the<br>
melamine decorative board of the present invention,<br>
a core material may be used. The core material is<br>
obtained, for example, by impregnating a kraft<br>
paper with a resin liquid composed primarily of<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resin and drying the<br>
impregnated kraft paper. A basis weight of the<br>
kraft paper is preferably, for example, in a range of<br>
about 150-300 g/m2. A degree of impregnation of<br>
the resin liquid, which is defined by the above<br>
mathematical formula 1, is preferably in a range of<br>
30-80%, for example.<br>
[0036] The present invention will hereinafter be described by<br>
Embodiments. Experimental Examples, and Comparative Examples,<br>

Embodiment I<br>
[0037] 1. Production of a composition<br>
One part by weight (in solid equivalent) of a<br>
siloxane graft-type polymer was mixe with 10 parts<br>
by weight (in solid equivalent) of an organosilica sol.<br>
As the siioxane graft-type polymer, ZX-022H<br>
(hydroxyl value: 120, acid value: 0, solvent species:<br>
xylene/butyl acetate/isopropanol, manufactured by<br>
Fuji Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) obtained by compositing<br>
fluorine resin with siloxane was used. As the<br>
organosilica sol, IPA-ST (isopropanol dispersion<br>
silica sol, average particle diameter: 10-20 nm,<br>
SiO2: 30% by weight, manufactured by Nissan<br>
Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was used. IPA-ST is an<br>
organosilica sol in which a hydrophilic solvent<br>
(isopropanol) is used.<br>
[0038] The above mixture was diluted with isopropanol<br>
so that a total solid content became 20% by weight,<br>
and a composition was obtained.<br>
[0039] 2. Production of a transfer sheet<br>
The above composition was uniformly applied to<br>
an OPP film having a thickness of 30 µm by a bar<br>
coat method so that an after-dried film thickness of<br>
the composition became 3 µm. The OPP film was<br>
dried to obtain a transfer sheet 1. In the transfer<br>
sheet 1, a layer composed of dried product of the<br>
above composition was formed on the OPP film.<br>
[0040] 3. Production of a melamine decorative board<br>
An overlay paper having a basis weight of 40<br>
g/m2 for use in a decorative board was impregnated<br>
with a resin liquid composed primarily of<br>
melamine-formaldehyde resin. A degree of<br>
impregnation of the resin liquid was set to 300%<br>
according to a calculating method defined by the<br>
above mathematical formula 1. The impregnated<br>
overlay paper was dried to obtain a melamine resin<br>
impregnated overlay paper 2.<br>
[0041] A black decorative paper having a basis weight<br>

decorative paper was dried to obtain a melamine<br>
resin impregnated decorative paper 3.<br>
[0042] A kraft paper having a basis weight of 200 g/m2<br>
was impregnated with a resin liquid composed<br>
primarily of phenol-formaldehyde resin. A degree<br>
of impregnation of the resin liquid was set to 50%<br>
according to the calculating method defined by the<br>
above mathematical formula 1. The impregnated<br>
kraft paper was dried to obtain a phenol resin<br>
impregnated core paper 4.<br>

resin impregnated core paper 4, a sheet of the<br>
melamine resin impregnated decorative paper 3, a<br>
sheet of the melamine resin impregnated overlay<br>
paper 2, and a sheet of the transfer sheet were<br>
stacked in this order. The transfer sheet 1, which<br>
includes an OPP film la and a dried film 1b of the<br>
composition, was stacked so that the dried film 1b<br>
came in contact with the melamine resin<br>
impregnated overlay paper 2. Heat and pressure<br>
are applied to the stacked body at a temperature of<br>
135°C and a pressure of 8 MPa for 80 minutes.<br>
Then, the OPP film la was removed to obtain a<br>
melamine decorative board 5 as shown in FIG. 2. A<br>
low refractive index layer 6 composed of a cured<br>
product of the composition was formed on a surface<br>
of the melamine decorative board 5. The low<br>
refractive index layer 6 was generated from the<br>
dried film lb of the composition.<br>

(Evaluation method)<br>
(i) Evaluation of anti-fingerprint property using<br>
an actual fingerprint<br>
An actual fingerprint was attached on a surface<br>
of each melamine decorative board, and it was<br>
visually evaluated how noticeable the fingerprint<br>
was. Evaluation criteria are as follows-<br>
[0088] o: The fingerprint is not noticeable<br>
[0089] ?: The fingerprint is slightly noticeable<br>
[0090] x: The fingerprint is noticeable<br>
[0091] (ii) Clarity<br>
Clarity of the decorative paper of the melamine<br>
decorative board was visually observed under<br>
oblique light. Evaluation criteria are as follows:<br>
[0092] o: The decorative paper can be clearly observed<br>
[0093] ?: Reflection of lights and white blur are<br>
slightly observed<br><br>
(iii) Surface durability (1)<br>
A surface of each melamine decorative board<br>
was wiped back and forth 100 times by dry cotton<br>
waste under a load of about 300 g/cm2, and change in<br>
gloss level on the surface was visually evaluated.<br>
Evaluation criteria are as follows:<br>
[0094] o: Change in gloss level is not observed<br>
[0095] ?: Change in gloss level is slightly observed<br>
[0096] x: Change in gloss level is observed<br>
(iv) surface durability (2)<br>
The surface of each melamine decorative board<br>
was wiped back and forth by dry cotton waste under<br>
a load of about 1 kg/cm2, and change in gloss level on<br>
the surface was visually evaluated. Evaluation<br>
criteria are as follows:<br>
[0097] 5: Change in gloss level is not observed when or<br>
before the surface was wiped back and forth 500<br>
times<br>
[0098] 4: Change in gloss level is observed when or<br>
before the surface was wiped back and forth 400<br>
times<br>
[0099] 3: Change in gloss level is observed when or<br>
before the surface was wiped back and forth 300<br>
times<br>
[0100] 2: Change in gloss level is observed when or<br><br>
before the surface was wiped back and forth 200<br>
times<br>
[0101] 1: Change in gloss level is observed when or<br>
before the surface was wiped back and forth 100<br>
times<br>
(v) Refractive index<br>
A refractive index on the surface of each<br>
melamine decorative board was measured with<br>
multi-wavelength Abbe refractometer (DR-M2,<br>
manufactured by Atago Co., Ltd.). Refractive index<br>
was measured at a wavelength of 589 nm.<br>
(vi) Surface hardness<br>
Surface hardness of each melamine decorative<br>
board was measured under a load of 1 kg according to<br>
JIS K 5600;1999 (general testing methods for<br>
paints).<br>
(vii) Abrasion resistance<br>
Abrasion resistance of the surface of each<br>
melamine decorative board was measured according<br>
to JIS K 6902;1998 (testing method for laminated<br>
thermosetting high-pressure decorative sheets)<br>
(Evaluation results)<br>
Tables 1 and 2 show the evaluation results. In<br>
Table 1, "(b1):(a)" represents a weight ratio (in solid<br>
equivalent) between the siloxane graft-type polymer<br><br>
(b1) and the organosilica sol (a). In Table 2,<br>
"(b2):(a)" represents a weight ratio (in solid<br>
equivalent) between the cold glass coating agent (b2)<br>
and the organosilica sol (a).<br><br><br>
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, in the melamine<br>
decorative boards of Embodiments 1-24, a<br>
fingerprint was less noticeable, and a printed<br>
pattern had high clarity. Moreover, the melamine<br>
decorative boards of Embodiments 1-24 exhibited<br>
high surface durability, high surface hardness, and<br>
high abrasion resistance. In contrast, in the<br>
melamine decorative board of Comparative Example<br>
1, a fingerprint was noticeable, and a printed<br>
pattern had low clarity.<br>
[0104] FIG. 3 is a photograph showing surface<br>
conditions of the melamine decorative boards of<br>
Embodiment 1 and Comparative Example 1. A right<br>
half of the photograph corresponds to the melamine<br>
decorative board of Embodiment 1, and a left half<br>
corresponds to the melamine decorative board of<br>
Comparative Example 1. As is clear from this<br>
photograph, in the melamine decorative board of<br>
Embodiment 1, the decorative paper had a high<br>
clarity, whereas the melamine decorative board of<br>
Comparative Example 1 was whitish and a<br>
decorative paper thereof had low clarity.<br>
[0105] FIG. 4 is a photograph showing a fingerprint<br>
attached on the surface of each melamine decorative<br>
boards of Embodiment 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
when anti-fingerprint property was evaluated using<br>
an actual fingerprint. A right half of the<br>
photograph corresponds to the melamine decorative<br>
board of Embodiment 1, and a left half corresponds<br>
to the melamine decorative board of Comparative<br>
Example 1. As is clear from this photograph, in the<br>
melamine decorative board of Embodiment 1, the<br>
fingerprint on the surface thereof was far less<br><br>
noticeable than that on the surface of the melamine<br>
decorative board of Comparative Example 1. This<br>
is attributed to the fact that the melamine<br>
decorative board of Embodiment 1 includes the low<br>
refractive index layer 6.<br>
[0106] The evaluation result of each of the melamine<br>
decorative boards of Experimental Examples 1 and 3<br>
was slightly inferior to that of each of Embodiments<br>
1-24 in surface durability.<br>
[0107] The evaluation result of the melamine<br>
decorative board of Experimental Example 2 was<br>
slightly inferior to that of each of Embodiments 1-24<br>
in anti-finger print property and clarity.<br>
[0108] The evaluation result of each of the melamine<br>
decorative boards of Experimental Examples 4 and 6<br>
was slightly inferior to that of each of Embodiments<br>
1-24 in surface durability and surface hardness.<br>
[0109] The evaluation result of the melamine<br>
decorative board of Experimental Example 5 was<br>
slightly inferior to that of each of Embodiments 1-24<br>
in anti-fingerprint property and clarity.<br><br>
