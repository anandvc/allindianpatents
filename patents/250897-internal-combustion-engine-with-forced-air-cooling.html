INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WITH FORCED AIR COOLING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a internal combustion engine with forced air cooling in which a cylinder block which is joined with a crankcase rotatably receiving a crankshaft and from which cooling fins project. A cylinder head is joined with the cylinder block with an ignition plug attached thereto. A shroud forms a cooling air path between the shroud and the cylinder block and cylinder head. A cooling fan is provided for ventilating cooling air aspirated from outside the shroud toward the cooling air path which is associated with and coupled to the crankshaft. An air outlet is provided for exhausting the cooling air flowing through the cooling air path that is formed to the shroud.<br>
Description of Background Art [0002] An internal combustion engine with forced air cooling is disclosed in JP-A No. H7-332084. In this intemal combustion engine with forced air cooling, an air outlet is provided to a shroud covering a cylinder block and a cylinder head, near the cylinder block and cylinder head to thoroughly cool the cylinder block and cylinder head.<br>
[0003] Cooling is needed particularly around an ignition plug, but the ignition plug is far from the air outlet in JP-A No. H7-332084.    The ignition plug needs to be cooled<br><br>
more efficiently.<br>
[0004]   An international combustion engine mounted on, for example, a scooter-type<br>
motorcycle is disposed inside body covers which cover a front portion and side<br>
portions of the intemal combustion engine, so that it is difficult to use a flow of air<br>
caused by operating the vehicle to cool the intemal combustion engine.<br>
[0005]   To address such a problem, configurations have been proposed in which a<br>
cylinder and a cylinder head of an intemal combustion engine are covered by a shroud<br>
configured such that air sucked in by a cooling fan is guided to flow around the<br>
cylinder and the cylinder head so as to forcedly cool the intemal combustion engine.<br>
See, for example, JP-A No. H07-026533,<br>
[0006]   In the international combustion engine with forced air cooling disclosed in<br>
JP-A No. H07-026533, a shroud surrounding a cylinder and a cylinder head includes a<br>
right shroud covering right side portions of the cylinder and the cylinder head. The<br>
right shroud extends rearwardly from the right side and is linked to a fan cover<br>
covering a cooling fan provided at a right end portion of a crankshaft.<br>
[0007]   The shroud also includes a left shroud covering left side portions of the<br>
cylinder and the cylinder head with an exhaust duct extending downwardly from the<br>
left shroud.<br>
[0008]   In the configuration, cooling air sucked in by rotation of the cooling fan in an<br>
approximately horizontal leftward direction is led diagonally forwardly by the right<br>
shroud and then changes the flow direction to flow leftwardly around the cylinder and<br>
the cylinder head thereby cooling them. The air having cooled the cylinder and the<br>
cylinder head changes the flow direction downwardly by hitting the left shroud to be<br>
then discharged from the exhaust duct to the outside.<br>
[0009]   As described above, the shroud described in the JP-A No. H07-026533 is<br>
configured such that the cooling air having cooled the cylinder and the cylinder head<br><br>
by flowing in a horizontal leftward direction perpendicularly changes its flow direction by hitting the left shroud to be then downwardly exhausted from the exhaust duct. In such a configuration, the air flow may become locally stagnant in internal comers of the left shroud and the air flow resistance is high, so that the cooling air flow rate is not likely to increase.<br>
SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION [0010]   In view of the circumstances, an object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide an internal combustion engine with forced air cooling for cooling an ignition plug efficiently.<br>
[0011] To achieve the above object according to an embodiment of the present invention, an internal combustion engine with forced air cooling is provided wherein a cylinder block is joined with a crankcase rotatably receiving a crankshaft and from which cooling fins project. A cylinder head is joined with the cylinder block with an ignition plug being attached thereto. A shroud forming a cooling air path between the shroud and the cylinder block and cylinder head is provided. A cooling fan for ventilating cooling air aspirated from outside the shroud toward the cooling air path is associated with and coupled to the crankshaft. An air outlet for discharging the cooling air having flowed through the cooling air path is formed to the shroud. A notched space is formed to a part of a periphery of the cylinder block by partially shortening or removing the cooling fins projecting from the periphery of the cylinder block. A first projection projecting inward along the notched space and a second projection projecting inward at a position where the ignition plug attached to one side of the cylinder head is between the second projection and first projection are formed to the shroud. [0012]   According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air outlet is<br><br>
provided to the shroud to be adjacent to an exhaust pipe which communicates with an exhaust port provided to the cylinder head and which is connected to the cylinder head. [0013] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the notched space is formed to the periphery of the cylinder block, the periphery being on a side corresponding to an inlet port provided to the cylinder head.<br>
[0014] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air outlet and second projection are formed to one of a pair of sides of the shroud, the pair of sides being disposed to opposing sides of a plane including an axis of the ignition plug, such that a portion corresponding to the ignition plug is between the air outlet and second projection.<br>
[0015] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the first projection and second projection are offset from each other in the direction along the plane including the axis of the ignition plug when viewed from the direction along the cylinder axis. [0016] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the ignition plug is attached to the cylinder head while being tilted toward the cooling fan. [0017] According to an embodiment of the present invention, cooling air ventilated by the cooling fan is discharged from an air outlet. First and second projections are formed to a side of a shroud such that an ignition plug is between the projections. Accordingly, the cooling air flowing toward the air outlet can be efficiently introduced around the ignition plug by the first and second projections to cool the ignition plug efficiently. Additionally, since the first projection projects inwardly along a notched space formed to a periphery of a cylinder block, an amount of cooling air flowing around a cylinder head having a higher temperature can be increased. [0018] According to an embodiment of the present invention, since the air outlet is disposed adjacent to an exhaust pipe, efficient cooling can be done around an exhaust port, which tends to have a high temperature.<br><br>
[0019] According to an embodiment of the present invention, since the first projection is formed to a side of the shroud, the side corresponding to an inlet port, an amount of cooling air flowing around the inlet port having a relatively low temperature can be reduced, and an amount of cooling air flowing around the ignition plug and the exhaust port can be increased by the reduction.<br>
[0020] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air outlet and second projection are formed to one of a pair of sides of the shroud, the pair of sides being disposed to opposing sides of a plane including an axis of the ignition plug, such that a portion corresponding to the ignition plug is between the air outlet and second projection. Accordingly, a path for the cooling air flowing around the ignition plug to the air outlet and a path for the cooling air flowing through the other side of the pair to the air outlet can be positively formed.<br>
[0021] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the first projection and second projection are offset from each other in the direction along the plane including the axis of the ignition plug. Accordingly, a path area for the cooling air flowing from around the cylinder block to around the cylinder head can be secured. Thus, the cooling air can be collected around the ignition plug without reducing the amount of the total cooling air.<br>
[0022] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the ignition plug is made closer to the cooling fan, so that the ignition plug can be cooled by the cooling air having a lower temperature.<br>
[0023] The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and it is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide an internal combustion engine with forced air cooling having a shroud configured to make cooling air for cooling portions to be cooled of the internal combustion engine flow unidirectionally and smoothly at a low air flow resistance to achieve a high cooling effect.<br><br>
[0024] To achieve the above object, according to an embodiment of the present invention an intemal combustion engine with forced air cooling includes a power unit having an intemal combustion engine with a forwardly tilted cylinder, a power transmission mechanism rearwardly extending from the intemal combustion engine, and a rear wheel joumaled to a rear portion of the power transmission mechanism which are unitedly and swingably supported by a vehicle body frame with a shroud surrounding the cylinder and a cylinder head of the intemal combustion engine. A cooling fan is driven by rotation of a crankshaft which sucks in outside air from a neighborhood of the crankshaft into the shroud to cool the cylinder and the cylinder head. An air cleaner is provided above a crankcase of the intemal combustion engine. In the intemal combustion engine with forced air cleaning the air cleaner has a cleaner air intake port provided above an axis of the cylinder with the shroud having a cooling air intake port formed on a side of the crankcase. A cooling air outlet port is formed in a side wall opposing another side wall where the cooling air intake port is formed with an air exhaust duct extending from the cooling air outlet port being located below the cylinder axis as seen in a side view while being located, as seen in a vehicle width direction, approximately outside the air cleaner and inside an outer surface of a transmission case cover covering the power transmission mechanism. [0025] According to an embodiment of the present invention, an air intake duct for taking outside air into the transmission case cover is provided with the air intake duct having an air intake port provided above the cylinder axis.<br>
[0026] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air intake port of the air intake duct is provided between the cleaner air intake port and the air exhaust port as seen in the vehicle width direction.<br>
[0027] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air intake duct and the cleaner air intake port are disposed to overlap with each other as seen in a side<br><br>
view.<br>
[0028] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air exhaust duct extends rearwardly along a lower end surface of the air intake duct to outside a vehicle body cover. The air exhaust duct having a rear-end air exhaust port which is opened rearwardly.<br>
[0029] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the shroud surrounding the cylinder and cylinder head has a cooling air outlet port formed in a side wall opposing another side wall in which a cooling air inlet port is formed. Therefore, the cooling air sucked in the shroud flows from the cooling air inlet port to the cooling air outlet port unidirectionally, evenly and smoothly to be discharged from the exhaust duct without locally stagnating in the shroud. As a result, portions to be cooled of the cylinder and cylinder head of the internal combustion engine can be cooled evenly and efficiently by the cooling air flowing at a low flow path resistance and at a high flow rate. Thus, a great cooling effect can be expected.<br>
[0030] Furthermore, the cleaner air intake port of the air cleaner provided above the crankcase is provided above the axis of a forwardly tilted cylinder as seen in a side view, and the air exhaust duct is provided below the cylinder axis. Therefore, the engine cooling air discharged, at a high temperature from the air exhaust port of the air exhaust duct can be prevented from being sucked into the cleaner air intake port provided above the cylinder axis. This can prevent the temperature of the intake cooling air from rising.<br>
[0031] Still furthermore, the air exhaust duct has an air exhaust port provided below the cylinder axis while being located, as seen in a vehicle width direction, outside the air cleaner and inside an outer surface of the transmission case cover covering the power transmission mechanism. Therefore, the air exhaust duct can be made small and can be installed compactly.<br><br>
[0032] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air intake duct for taking outside air into the transmission case cover has an air intake port provided above the cylinder axis. Therefore, the engine cooling air discharged, at a high temperature, from the air exhaust port of the air exhaust duct provided below the cylinder axis can be prevented from being sucked into the air intake port. [0033] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air intake port of the air intake duct is provided between the cleaner air intake port and the air exhaust port as seen in the vehicle width direction. Therefore, if the engine cooling air exhausted from the air exhaust port flows upwardly, for example, when the vehicle is stopped, the exhaust air is led to the nearer air intake port, so that the exhaust air is prevented from reaching and being sucked into the farther cleaner air intake port. This can prevent the intake air temperature from rising.<br>
[0034] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air intake duct and the cleaner air intake port are disposed to overlap with each other as seen in a side view, so that the air intake duct serves as a guard to further prevent the engine cooling air exhausted from the air exhaust port from being sucked into the cleaner air intake port. The air intake duct can also prevent foreign matter from entering the cleaner air intake port.<br>
[0035] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the air exhaust duct extends, rearwardly along a lower end surface of the air intake duct, to outside a vehicle body cover, the air exhaust duct having a rear-end air exhaust port which is opened rearwardly. Therefore, the engine cooling air discharged from the air exhaust port is not held inside the body cover. The flow of air caused by operating the vehicle and flowing rearwardly along the lower-end surface of the transmission case cover particularly applies a negative pressure to the engine cooling air. This all the more promotes discharging of the engine cooling air, increases the flow rate of the engine<br><br>
cooling air, and improves the cooling effect.<br>
[0036]  Furthermore, the air exhaust duct extends rearwardly along a lower-end<br>
surface of the air intake duct without causing the air exhaust duct to bulge to the sides.<br>
This improves the external appearance of the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0037]  Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the detailed description given hereinafter.   However, it should be understood<br>
that the detailed description  and specific examples,  while indicating preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various<br>
changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become<br>

An exhaust rocker arm 106 is pivotally received by the exhaust rocker shaft 104 to open and close the exhaust valve 50 by following the exhaust cam 102. [0077]   In addition, a decompression device 32 having a decompression cam 33<br><br>
projecting from a base circle portion 102a of the exhaust cam 102 when the speed of the internal combustion engine E is low, under a predetermined value, is provided to the camshaft 53. The decompression device 32 can open the exhaust valve 50 at a valve closing timing defined by the base circle portion 102a of the exhaust cam 102 when the speed of the internal combustion engine E is under the predetermined value. Accordingly, the exhaust valve 50 opens slightly to reduce a pressure of the combustion chamber 42 slightly, so that cranking torque can be reduced. [0078] An inlet pipe 57 communicating with the inlet port 47 is fastened to the upper side of the cylinder head 37. The inlet pipe 57 is formed to curve arcuately toward the rear of the motorcycle. As shown in FIG 1, the upstream end of the inlet pipe 57 is connected to the downstream end of a carburetor 58 disposed rearwardly of the inlet pipe 57 via a connecting tube 59. The upstream end of the carburetor 58 is connected to an air cleaner 60 disposed to the right side of the rear wheel WR and above the power unit P.<br>
[0079] An exhaust pipe 61 communicating with the exhaust port 48 is connected to the lower side of the cylinder head 37. The downstream end of the exhaust pipe 61 is connected to an exhaust muffler 62 disposed to the right side of the rear wheel WR. [0080] Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a transmission case 80 extending to the left of the rear wheel WR is coupled to the crankcase 35 with the motorcycle facing the traveling direction. The transmission case 80 includes a case body 81 integrally provided to the case half 35b of the crankcase 35 and extending rearwardly with a left cover 82 fastened to the left side of the case body 81 to form a first transmission chamber 84 between the left cover 82 and the case body 81. A right cover 83 is fastened to the left side of the case body 81 to form a second transmission chamber 85 between the right cover 83 and the case body 81. [0081]   In front of the case body 81 in the transmission case 80, a support arm 86 is<br><br>
disposed to the side of the cylinder block 36 in the internal combustion engine E in a projecting manner. The support arm 86 is pivotally supported by the bracket 22 of the body frame 15 via the link mechanism 23.<br>
[0082] An axle 87 of the rear wheel WR is rotatably received by the rear portion of the case body 81 in the transmission case 80 and by the right cover 83. The rear shock absorber 24 is provided between the rear portion of the case body 81 and an upper frame 21a in the rear frame pipe 21 on the left side in the body frame 15. [0083] The continuously variable transmission M uses a V belt, and is housed in the first transmission chamber 84. A reduction gear train 88 is provided between the continuously variable transmission M and axle 87.<br>
[0084] The continuously variable transmission M is well known, and includes a drive pulley 89 coupled to the other end of the crankshaft 45 outside the crankcase 35 with a driven pulley 92 mounted, via a centrifugal clutch 91, to a driven shaft 90 which has an axis parallel to the crankshaft 45 and which is rotatably received by the rear portion of the case body 81 and by the right cover 83. An endless V belt 93 is wrapped around the drive pulley 89 and driven pulley 92.<br>
[0085] Thereafter, the drive pulley 89 operates to increase a contact radius between the drive pulley 89 and the V belt 93 as multiple weight rollers 95 housed between a ramp plate 94 fixed to the crankshaft 45 and the drive pulley 89 in a floating state move in the radius direction of the crankshaft 45 in response to the increase of the speed of the crankshaft 45.<br>
[0086] On the other hand, the driven pulley 92 operates to decrease a contact radius between the driven pulley 92 and the V belt 93 as a contact radius between the drive pulley 89 and the V belt 93 increases. Accordingly, a continuously variable transmitting is done in accordance with the speed of the crankshaft 45 between the crankshaft 45 and driven shaft 90.<br><br>
[0087] The reduction gear train 88 is provided between the driven shaft 90 and axle 87 and is housed in the second transmission chamber 85. Rotational power of the driven shaft 90 in the continuously variable transmission M is reduced by the reduction gear train 88, and then transmitted to the axle 87 of the rear wheel WR. [0088] A kick shaft 97 is rotatably received by the left cover 82 in the transmission case 80. A kick pedal 98 (see FIG. 1) is provided to the outer end of the kick pedal 97. Inside the left cover 82, a kick starter 99 which can transmit driving force of the kick shaft 97 to the crankshaft 45 in response to the depression of the kick pedal 98 is provided between the kick shaft 97 and crankshaft 45.<br>
[0089] Referring to FIG 2, an outer rotor 66 of a generator 65 is fixed to one end of the crankshaft 45 outside the crankcase 35. A stator 67 surrounded by the outer rotor 66 is fixed to the crankcase 35. A cooling fan 68 is fixed to the crankshaft 45 outside the generator 65. The cooling fan 68 has multiple blades 68b integrally provided to the periphery of a base 68a fastened to the outer rotor 66 of the generator 65. [0090] In the engine body 34, part of the crankcase 35, the cylinder block 36, and the cylinder head 37 are covered with the shroud 70. Air for forced air cooling discharged from the cooling fan 68 flows through a cooling air path 71 formed between the engine body 34 and shroud 70. To achieve efficient cooling by cooling air flowing through the cooling air path 71, multiple cooling fins 36a and multiple cooling fins 37a project from the outer surfaces of the cylinder block 36 and cylinder head 37 respectively. A notched space 78 is formed to a part of the periphery of the cylinder block 36 by partially shortening or removing the cooling fins 36a projecting from the periphery of the cylinder block 36. In this embodiment, the notched space 78 is formed to the periphery of the cylinder head 36 on the side corresponding to the inlet port 47 provided to the cylinder head 36, namely the portion corresponding to the upper side of the periphery of the cylinder block 36.<br><br>
[0091] The shroud 70 includes a vertical pair of an upper cover member 72 and a lower cover member 73 joined with each other to cover the cylinder block 36 and cylinder head 37 in cooperation with each other with a fan cover 74 covering part of the crankcase 35 and joined with the cover members 72, 73. The upper cover member 72, lower cover member 73, and fan cover 74 are made of a synthetic resin. [0092] Multiple engaging pawls 108 projecting from a matching surface 107 for the upper cover member 73 to the lower cover member 73 is provided to the upper cover member 72. Locking portions 109 are provided to the lower cover member 73 to achieve a resilient engagement of the engaging pawls 108. Multiple fastening portions 110 and multiple fastening portions 111 abutting on each other at the matching surface 107 are provided to the upper cover member 72 and the lower cover member 73, respectively. The fastening portions 110 and fastening portions 111 abutting on each other are fastened with each other by screw members 112. [0093] By resiliently engaging the engaging pawls 108 with the locking portions 109 and by fastening the fastening portions 111 and fastening portions 112 with each other by use of the screw members 112, the upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73 are joined with each other. The upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73 joined with each other are joined with the crankcase 35 of the engine body 34 by use of multiple bolts 113. The head cover 38 forwardly projects from the upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73.<br>
[0094] The fan cover 74 is joined with the case half 35a to cover the case half 35a, which is part of the crankcase 35, and the cooling fan 68. Then, the fan cover 74 is joined with the upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73. [0095] An inlet pipe 76 forming an inlet opening 75 for aspirating air from the outside to the cooling fan 68 is provided to the fan cover 74 to correspond to the cooling fan 68 outside the cooling fan 68.    A louver 77 is provided to the inlet<br><br>
opening 76.<br>
[0096] In FIG 1, a flange portion 114 facing the opening end of the exhaust port 48 is provided to the lower side of the cylinder head 37 for the connection of the exhaust pipe 61. An opening 115 whose front has a shape corresponding to the flange portion 114 is provided to the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70, and extends from the portion corresponding to the flange portion 114 in the posterior direction. With the exhaust pipe 61 being connected to the flange portion 114, an air outlet 116 is formed between the outer surface of the exhaust pipe 61 and the periphery of the opening 115. In other words, the air outlet 116 is provided to the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 to be adjacent to the exhaust pipe 61. [0097] The ignition plug 51 whose axis is disposed on a plane including the matching surface 107 of the upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 is attached to the right side of the cylinder head 37 facing in the traveling direction of the motorcycle On the other hand, the air outlet 116 is formed to one of a pair of sides of the shroud 70, the pair of sides being along a plane including the axis of the ignition plug 51, namely to the lower side of the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 in this embodiment.<br>
[0098] In FIGS. 8 and 9, a first projection 72a projecting inwardly along the notched space 78 formed to the periphery of the cylinder block 36 is formed to a side of the shroud 70, the side corresponding to the inlet port 47 of the cylinder head 36, namely to the upper side of the upper cover member 72. A second projection 73a projecting inwardly at a position where the ignition plug 51 attached to the side of the cylinder 37 is between the second projection 73a and first projection 72a is formed to the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70.<br>
[0099] As designated in FIG. 6, the first projection 72a and second projection 73a are offset from each other in the direction along the axis of the ignition plug 51 when<br><br>
viewed from the direction along the cylinder axis. The air outlet 116 and second projection 73a are formed to one of a pair of sides of the shroud 70, the pair of sides being disposed to opposing sides of the plane including the axis of the plug 51, namely to the lower side of the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 in this embodiment, such that a portion corresponding to the ignition plug 51 is between the air outlet 116 and second projection 73a.<br>
[00100] The ignition plug 51 is attached to the cylinder head while being tilted toward the cooling fan 68. A through opening 117 for enabling the attachment of the ignition plug 51 and for introducing a high tension cord connected to the ignition plug 51 from the shroud 70 to the outside is formed to the matching surface 107 between the upper cover member 72 and lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70. [00101] The operation of this embodiment is explained below. The cylinder block 36 and cylinder head 37 are surrounded by the shroud 70 forming the cooling air path 71 between the shroud 70 and the cylinder block 36 and cylinder head 37. The cooling fan 68 for ventilating the cooling air aspirated from outside the shroud 70 toward the cooling air path 71 is associated with and coupled to the crankshaft 45. The first projection 72a projecting inwardly along the notched space 78 formed to a part of the periphery of the cylinder block 36 by partially shortening or removing the cooling fms 36 projecting from the periphery of the cylinder block 36 and the second projection 73a projecting inwardly at the position where the ignition plug 51 attached to one side of the cylinder head 37 is between the second projection 73a and first projection 72a are formed to the shroud 70.<br>
[00102] The cooling air ventilated by the cooling fan 68 is discharged from the air outlet 116 on the lower side of the lower cover member 73. The first projection 72a and second projection 73a are formed to the side of the shroud 70 such that the ignition plug 51  is between the first projection 72a and second projection 73a.<br><br>
Accordingly, the cooling air flowing toward the air outlet 116 is efficiently introduced around the ignition plug 51 by the first projection 72a and second projection 73a, so that the ignition plug 51 can be efficiently cooled. Since the first projection 72a projects inwardly along the notched space 78 formed to the periphery of the cylinder block 36, an amount of the cooling air flowing around the cylinder head 37 having a higher temperature can be increased.<br>
[00103] Further, the air outlet 116 is formed to the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 to be adjacent to the exhaust pipe 61 which communicates with the exhaust port 48 of the cylinder head 37 and which is connected to the cylinder head 37. Accordingly, efficient cooling can be done around the exhaust port 48, which tends to have a high temperature.<br>
[00104] The projection 72a projecting inwardly is formed to the side of the shroud 70, the side corresponding to the inlet port 47 of the cylinder head 36, namely, to the upper side of the upper cover member 72. Accordingly, an amount of the cooling air flowing around the inlet port 47 having a relatively low temperature can be reduced, and an amount of the cooling air flowing around the ignition plug 51 and exhaust port 48 can be increased by the reduction.<br>
[00105] The air outlet 116 and second projection 73a are formed to one side of the pair of sides of the shroud 70 with the pair of sides being disposed to opposing sides of the plane including the axis of the plug 51, namely to the lower side of the lower cover member 73 of the shroud 70 in this embodiment, such that the portion corresponding to the ignition plug 51 is between the air outlet 116 and second projection 73a. Accordingly, the path for the cooling air flowing around the ignition plug 51 toward the air outlet 116 and the path for the cooling air flowing around the upper cover member 72 toward the air outlet 116 can be positively formed. [00106] The first projection 72a and second projection 73a are offset from each other<br><br>
in the direction along the axis of the ignition plug 51 when viewed from the direction<br>
along the cylinder axis.    Accordingly, the path area for the cooling air flowing from<br>
around the cylinder block 36 to around the cylinder head 37 can be secured. Thus, the<br>
cooling air can be easily collected around the ignition plug 51 while preventing the<br>
reduction of the amount of the total cooling air.<br>
[00107] Further, the ignition plug 51 is attached to the cylinder head 37 while being<br>
tilted toward the cooling fan 68.    Accordingly, the ignition plug 51 is made closer to<br>
the cooling fan 68, so that the ignition plug 51 can be cooled by the cooling air having<br>
a lower temperature.<br>
[00108] An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with<br>

[00124] A step plate 215 is installed in the floor portion 201C. The step plate 215<br>
includes a horizontal floor step portion 215f and a pillion step portion 215r extending,<br>
on the left and right sides, rearwardly and upwardly.<br>
[00125] The pillion step portion 215r projects horizontally and laterally so that the<br>
passenger sitting on the pillion 205r can rest, on each side, his or her foot F (shown in<br>
dotted line in Fig. 10) on it.<br>
[00126] A lower side cover 216 extends, below the step plate 215, along the edge on<br>
each side of the step plate 215.<br>
[00127] The vehicle body rear portion 201R is connected to an upper portion of the<br>
pillion step portion 215r of the step plate 215. A body cover 217 covers a portion of<br>
the vehicle body rear portion 201R, the portion extending from a location forward of<br>
the main pipes 204 to left and right sides of the vehicle body rear portion 20IR. An<br>
upper-end opening of the body cover 217 is openably covered by the seat 205.<br>
[00128] As seen in a side view, a rear fender 218 extends rearwardly and downwardly<br>
from a rear portion of the body cover 217 thereby covering the rear wheel 221 from<br>
above, the rear portion of the body cover 217 extending rearwardly and upwardly to<br><br>
be gradually thinner.<br>
[00129] As seen in a left side view (see Fig. 10), the rear end portions 217e, 215e, and<br>
216e, being successively overlaid, of the body cover 217, step plate 215, and lower<br>

215 and the lower side cover 216 are fitted to each other of the rear end portions 215e<br>
and 216e project rearwardly.  A horizontal portion  included  in  the rearwardly<br>
projecting portion of the rear end portion 215e of the pillion step portion 215r is<br>
designed to be where the passenger rests the heel Fh of his or her foot F.<br>
[00130] An upper portion of the rearwardly projecting portion of the rear end portion<br>
215e of the step plate 215 is shaped to be forwardly concave and continuous with the<br>
rear end portion 217e of the body cover 217, thereby forming a concave 219.<br>
Therefore, when the passenger rests the heel Fh of his or her foot F on the pillion step<br>
portion 215r, there is the uncovered concave 219 on the inside of the heel Fh placed<br>
on the pillion step portion 215r (see Fig. 1).<br>

A shroud 268 surroundingly covering the cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233 is provided continuously with the fan cover 267.<br>
[00142] In the crankcase section 231a of the unit swing case 231, the cam chain chamber 252 is formed being separated from the crankcase by the main bearing 241. The left side wall of the cam chain chamber 252 forms a separation wall 271 which separates the continuously variable belt-type transmission chamber 270 to the left of the separation wall 271 from the cam chain chamber 252. A circular through hole 271a, through which the crankshaft 240 extends, is formed through the separation wall 271, the through hole 271a having a flat cylindrical shape with a large diameter. An annular sealing member 272 is press-fitted in the through hole 271a. The crankshaft 240 extends through the hollow portion of the annular sealing member 272. [00143J The drive sprocket 255 is fitted in a portion between the sealing member 272<br><br>
and the main bearing 241 of the crankshaft 240. The cam chain 251 is wound on the<br>

[00144] The sealing member 272 watertightly separates the continuously variable<br>
belt-type transmission chamber 270 and the cam chain chamber 252, so that oil<br>
leakage from the latter to the former is prevented.<br>
[00145] A belt drive pulley 276 is rotatably provided on the crankshaft 240 extending<br>
through the sealing member 272.<br>
[00146] The belt drive pulley 276 includes a fixed pulley half 277 and a movable<br>
pulley half 278. The fixed pulley half 277 is fixed, via a boss 279, to a left end portion<br>
of the crankshaft 240. The movable pulley half 278 is spline-fitted, on the right of the<br>
fixed pulley half 277, to the crankshaft 240. The movable pulley half 278 rotates<br>
together with the crankshaft 240. While rotating, the movable pulley half 278 can<br>
axially slide toward or away from the fixed pulley half 277. A V-belt 275 is rotatably<br>
held between the fixed pulley half 277 and the movable pulley half 278.<br>
[00147] A cam plate 280 is fixedly provided, closely to the annular sealing member<br>
272, to the right of the movable pulley half 278. A slide piece 280a provided in an<br>
outer peripheral end portion of the cam plate 280 is slidably engaged with a cam plate<br>
sliding boss portion 278a axially formed in an outer peripheral end portion of the<br>
movable pulley half 278.<br>
[00148] The side surface on the cam plate 280 side of the movable pulley half 278 is<br>
tapered toward the cam plate 280. A dry weight roller 281 is accommodated on the<br>
inner side of the tapered surface, that is, between the tapered surface and the cam plate<br>
280.<br>
[00149] When the rotation speed of the crankshaft 240 increases, the dry weight roller<br>
281 also rotating between the movable pulley half 278 and the cam plate 280 is<br>
centrifugally moved in the centrifugal direction to push and move the movable pulley<br><br>
half 278 leftward closer to the fixed pulley half 277. As a result, the V-belt 275 held between the pulley halves 277 and 278 is moved in the centrifugal direction to increase the winding diameter.<br>
[00150] A belt-driven pulley 286 corresponding to the belt-drive pulley 276 is disposed rearward of the belt drive pulley 276 and includes a fixed pulley half 287 and a movable pulley half 288. The fixed pulley half 287 is fitted to an inner sleeve 289 which is supported to be rotatable relative to a speed reducer input shaft 292 of the speed reduction mechanism 238. The movable pulley half 288 is fitted to an outer sleeve 290 which is axially movably supported, to the left of the fixed pulley half 287, by the inner sleeve 289.<br>
[00151] The V-belt 275 is held between the pulley halves 287 and 288. [00152] A centrifugal clutch 291 is provided on the left side of the speed reducer input shaft 292 and inner sleeve 289. When the rotation speed of the inner sleeve 289 increases, the centrifugal clutch 291 engages to transmit the power transmitted to the inner sleeve 289 via the V-belt 275 to the speed reducer input shaft 292. [00153] In the speed reduction mechanism 238, the power transmitted to the speed reducer input shaft 292 is transmitted to an output shaft 294 via an intermediate shaft 293, that is, the rotation of the input shaft 292 is transmitted to the output shaft 294 after deceleration by means of a gear engagement. The output shaft 294 makes up a rear wheel shaft to rotate the rear wheel 221.<br>
[00154] Referring to Fig. 14, a transmission case cover 236 covering the continuously variable belt-type transmission chamber 270 from the left side covers a portion of the continuously variable belt-type transmission chamber 270 extending from the belt-drive pulley 276 on the front side to the centrifugal clutch 291 on the rear side. A kick shaft 227 is rotatably inserted through and supported at a portion slightly forward of a middle portion of the transmission case cover 236. A drive helical gear 2100 is fitted<br><br>
to an inner end portion of the kick shaft 227. The drive helical gear 2100 is biased by<br>
a return spring 2101.<br>
[00155] A sliding shaft 2102 is supported at a front inner portion of the transmission<br>
case cover 236 coaxially with the crankshaft 240, rotatably, and axially slidably. A<br>
driven helical gear 2103 is formed on the sliding shaft 2102 and is engaged with the<br>
drive helical gear 2100. A ratchet wheel 2104 is fixed to a right end portion of the<br>
driven helical gear 2103. These parts as a whole are biased leftward by a friction<br>
spring 2104.<br>
[00156] On the boss 279 on the crankshaft 240 side, a ratchet 279a opposing the<br>
ratchet wheel 2105 is formed. They can be brought into or out of contact with each<br>
other by sliding the sliding shaft 2102.<br>
[00157] When a kick pedal is pressed down and the kick shaft 227 rotates opposing<br>
the return spring 2101, the drive helical gear 2100 rotates integrally with the kick<br>
shaft 227. This causes the driven helical gear 2103 engaged with the drive helical gear<br>
2100 to rotate integrally with the sliding shaft 2102 and slide rightward opposing the<br>
friction spring 2105. As a result, the ratchet wheel 2104 engages the ratchet 279a<br>
formed on the boss 279, and the crankshaft 240 is forcedly rotated to start the intemal<br>
combustion engine 230.<br>
[00158] In the present intemal combustion engine, a starter motor 2110 is disposed<br>
above the crankcase section 231a of the left unit case 23IL. As shown in Fig. 16, the<br>
starter motor 2110 includes a leftwardly projecting pinion 2113 around which an inner<br>
rotor coil 2112 surrounded by an outer stator magnet 2111 is wound. A gear 2113a is<br>
formed at an end portion of the pinion 2113.<br>
[00159] A jump gear mechanism 2115 held between the crankcase section 231a and<br>
the transmission case cover 236 is positioned between the starter motor 2110 and the<br>
belt-drive pulley 276 with its shaft laterally horizontally oriented. The pinion gear<br><br>
2113a of the starter motor 2110 is engaged with an input gear 2116 disposed to the<br>
right of the jump gear mechanism 2115. A left jump gear 2117 is disposed to the left<br>
of the jump gear mechanism 2115. When the left jump gear 2117 jumps out leftward,<br>
it engages a starter ring gear 277a formed on an outer peripheral edge of the fixed<br>
pulley half 277.<br>
[00160] Therefore, when the starter motor 2110 is started, the rotation of the pinion<br>
2113 is transmitted to the input gear 2116 of the jump gear mechanism 2115, causing<br>
the jump gear 2117 to jump out leftward and engage the starter ring gear 277a of the<br>
fixed pulley half 277. As a result, the fixed pulley half 277 rotates together with the<br>
crankshaft 240 to start the internal combustion engine 230.<br>
[00161] When the starter motor 2110 stops, the jump gear 2117 retracts to be<br>
disengaged from the starter ring gear 277a.<br>
[00162] The fixed pulley half 277 on which the starter ring gear 277a to be engaged<br>
with the jump gear 2117 is formed has a cooling fan 2118 made of iron and bolted<br>
(not shown) to its side (left side) opposite to the side where the V-belt 275 is held. The<br>
cooling fan 2118 operates to take in the outside air for cooling the continuously<br>
variable belt-type transmission 235.<br>
[00163] The transmission case cover 236 includes a side wall and a peripheral wall,<br>
the former covering a left side portion and the latter surrounding an outer peripheral<br>
portion, respectively, of the continuously variable belt-type transmission 235. As<br>
shown in Fig. 17, the side wall includes, in a front portion thereof, a concave wall<br>
portion 236a which is continuous, via a step 236b, with the remaining portion of the<br>
side wall. The concave wall portion 236a has a case air intake port 236c which, facing<br>
leftward, has a deformed rectangular shape.<br>
[00164] As shown in broken line in Fig. 17, a cylindrical case air exhaust duct 236d is<br>
formed to extend, in an approximately central portion in the front-rear direction of the<br><br>
side wall, in a diagonal upward-downward direction along the inner surface of the side<br>
wall. The upper end of the exhaust duct 236d is opened to the chamber interior. The<br>
lower end is opened to the outside.<br>
[00165] Thus, the case air intake port 236c in a front portion of the transmission case<br>
cover 236 is opened toward the cooling fan 2118 heat-bonded to the fixed pulley half<br>
277 (see Fig. 14). The rotation of the cooling fan 2118 can take cooling air into the<br>
continuously variable belt-type transmission chamber 270 through the case air intake<br>
port 236c. The cooling air having cooled the continuously variable  belt-type<br>
transmission 235 can be exhausted to the outside through the case air exhaust duct<br>
236d<br>
[00166] A support 236e to support the jump gear 2117 is formed in an upper portion<br>
of the concave wall portion 236a provided in a front portion of the transmission case<br>
cover 236, the support 236e having a partially circular conic shape. Bolt holes 236i<br>
and 236j are formed above and below the case air intake port 236c, respectively.<br>
[00167] An air intake duct 2150 serving also as a heel guide member is fitted to the<br>
concave wall portion 236a provided in a front portion of the transmission case cover<br>
236.<br>
[00168] An inner wall member 2151 and an outer wall cover member 2161 of the air<br>
intake duct 2150 are united to form an air intake duct which internally provides air<br>
passage space.<br>
[00169] As shown in Figs. 18 to 20, the inner wall member 2151 includes an inner<br>
wall 2152 which is shaped like a pectoral fin of a fish as seen in a side view (see Figs.<br>
18 and 19). The inner wall 2152 includes an upper wall portion 2152u, a lower wall<br>
portion 21521, and a slanted wall portion 2152s, the three wall portions being vertical<br>
as seen in a front view and shaping the inner wall 2152 such that the upper wall<br>
portion 2152u and the lower wall portion 21521 being laterally shifted from each other<br><br>
are linked by the slanted wall portion 2152s (see Fig. 20).<br>
[00170] A peripheral wall 2153 projects on the left side surface of the inner wall 2152<br>
to be shghtly inside the peripheral edge of the inner wall 2152 (see Fig. 18).<br>
[00171] The upper wall portion 2152u of the inner wall 2152 includes an air intake<br>
port 2154 formed inside the peripheral wall 2153. A louver 2155 is installed over the<br>
air intake port 2154.<br>
[00172] In the lower wall portion 21521 of the inner wall 2152, a connection port<br>
2152c corresponding to the case air intake port 236c formed in the concave wall<br>
portion 236a is formed.<br>
[00173] In   the   slanted   wall   portion   2152s,   a   circular   conic   portion   2152e<br>
corresponding to the circular conic support 236e formed on the transmission case<br>
cover 236 is formed.<br>
[00174] On the left side surface of the inner wall 2152, a projecting strip is projects to<br>
extend to be curved forwardly and downwardly from above the cormection port 2152c<br>
along a f|-ont side of the connection port 2152c. A front lower portion of the projecting<br>
strip 2156 extends downwardly in parallel with a front side portion of the peripheral<br>
wall 2153, forming a drain passage 2170 between them.<br>
[00175] The drain passage 2170 has an open lower end.<br>
[00176] A linear projecting strip 2157 projects upwardly of the projecting strip 2156<br>
and downward of the air intake port 2154.<br>
[00177] The projecting strip 2157 extends, below the air intake port 2154, forwardly<br>
and slightly downwardly from a rear edge portion of the peripheral wall 2153. A rear<br>
portion of the lower projecting strip 2156 is positioned below a front portion of the<br>
upper projecting strip 2157, forming an air passage 2160 between them.<br>
[00178] A cutout 2153b is formed at a location downward of a rear end portion of the<br>
projecting strip 2156 with the location being in a slanted rear edge portion of the<br><br>
peripheral wall 2153. A fixing hole 2158i is formed in an upper end portion of the<br>
portion below the cutout 2153b of the peripheral wall 2153. A projecting strip 2153a<br>
extends forwardly and upwardly from the fixing hole 2158i,<br>
[00179] The fixing hole 2158i is located above the connection port 2152c and<br>
corresponds to the bolt hole 236i formed in the transmission case cover 236. A fixing<br>
hole 2158J corresponding to the bolt hole 236j is formed below the connection port<br>
2152c.<br>
[00180] A catching projection 2159p projects on a rear edge portion, which is more<br>
rearwardly positioned than the air intake port 2154, of the upper wall portion 2152u of<br>
the inner wall 2152. Another catching projection 2159q projects on a curved lower<br>
front edge portion of the lower wall portion 21521.<br>
[00181] As shown in Figs. 21 to 23, the outer wall cover member 2161 includes an<br>
outer wall 2162 which is shaped approximately the same as the inner wall 2152 of the<br>
inner wall member 2151 as seen in a side view (see Figs. 21 and 22). The outer wall<br>
2162 includes an upper wall portion 2162u, a lower wall portion 21621, and a slanted<br>
wall portion 2162s, the three wall portions being vertical as seen in a front view and<br>
shaping the outer wall 2162 such that the upper wall portion 2162u and the lower wall<br>
portion 21621 being laterally shifted from each other are linked by the slanted wall<br>
portion 2162s (see Fig. 23).<br>
[00182] A peripheral wall 2163 slightly larger than the peripheral wall 2153 of the<br>
inner wall member 2151 projects on the right side surface of and along the peripheral<br>
edge of the outer wall 162 (see Fig. 22).<br>
[00183] A projecting strip 2166 projects on the right side surface of the outer wall<br>
2162, the projecting strip 2166 being shaped to fit the upper side of the projecting<br>
strip 2156 curvedly formed on the left side surface of the inner wall 2152. Thus, the<br>
drain passage 2170 is also formed between the projecting strip 2166 and the<br><br>
peripheral wall 2163.<br>
[00184] A projecting strip 2167 projects upwardly of the projecting strip 2166, the<br>
projecting strip 2167 being shaped to fit the upper side of the linear projecting strip<br>
2157 formed on the left side surface of the inner wall 2152.<br>
[00185] Fixing holes 2168i and 2168j corresponding to the fixing holes 2158i and<br>
2158J are formed in a middle portion and a lower end portion of the rear slanted<br>
portion of the peripheral wall 2163.<br>
[00186] Catching pieces 2169p and 2169q corresponding to the catching projections<br>
2159p and 2159q are formed in an upper rear edge portion and a lower front edge<br>
portion, respectively, of the peripheral wall 2163.<br>
[00187] The catching piece 2169p is shaped like a hook to catch and engage the<br>
catching projection 2159p. The catching piece 2169q has a hole into which the<br>
catching projection 2159 is inserted for engagement.<br>
[00188] The inner wall member 2151 and the outer wall cover member 2161 are<br>
joined together by aligning the inner wall 2152 and the outer wall 2162 such that they<br>
face each other and fitting the peripheral wall 2163 of the outer wall cover member<br>
2161 around the outer periphery of the peripheral wall 2153 of the inner wall member<br>
2151. In doing this, first, the catching projection 2159q of the inner wall member<br>
2151 is inserted into the catching piece 2169q of the outer wall cover member 2161<br>
thereby engaging the two parts, and then the inner wall member 2151 and the outer<br>
wall cover member 2161 are joined together by fitting the peripheral wall 2153 and<br>
the peripheral wall 2163 to each other. When this is done, the catching projection<br>
2159p of the inner wall member 2151 is caught by the catching piece 2169p of the<br>
outer wall cover member 2161. As a result, the inner wall member 2151 and the outer<br>
wall cover member 2161 are united into an air intake duct 2150.<br>
[00189] Inside the air intake duct 2150, an air passage 2160 is formed by the linear<br><br>
upper projecting strips 2157 and 2167 and the curved lower projecting strips 2156 and 2166. The air passage 2160 has a labyrinth structure and leads from the air intake port 2154 formed in an upper portion of the inner wall 2152 to the connection port 2152c formed in a lower portion of the inner wall 2152.<br>
[00190] If mud or water enters the air passage 2160 through the air intake port 2154, the mud or water flows forward over the upper surfaces of the inclined upper projecting strips 2157 and 2167, drops from the front ends of the inclined upper projecting strips 2157 and 2167 onto the lower projecting strips 2156 and 2166. The mud or water then further flows forward over the curved projecting strips 2156 and 2166, that is, down through the drain passage 2170 to be subsequently discharged to the outside.<br>
[00191] The air intake duct 2150 is fitted to the concave wall portion 236a formed in a front portion of the transmission case cover 236.<br>
[00192] In doing this, the lower wall portions 21521 and 21621 and slanted wall portions 2152s and 2162s of the air intake duct 2150 are fitted to the concave wall portion 236a, and the mutually fitted fixing holes 2158i and 2168i and the mutually fitted fixing holes 2158j and 2168j are fitted to the corresponding bolt holes 236i and 236j, respectively, formed in the transmission case cover 236. Bolts 2171 and 2172 are then inserted through the corresponding fixing holes and bolt holes thus fitted together and tightened to fix the air intake duct 2150 to the transmission case cover 236,<br>
[00193] When the air intake duct 2150 has been fixed to the transmission case cover 236, the outer surface of the outer wall cover member 2161 of the air intake duct 2150 is coplanar with the outer surface of the transmission case cover 36. The connection port 2152c formed in a lower portion of the inner wall member 2151 is connected to the case air intake port 236c formed in the transmission case cover 236.<br><br>
[00194] The upper wall portions 2152u and 2162u of the air intake duct 2150 project upwardly above the transmission case cover 236 while curving toward the vehicle inside. The air intake portion 2154 formed in the upper wall portion 2152u of the inner wall member 2151 is open to the right (toward the vehicle inside). [00195] The louver 2155 provided at the air intake port 2154 faces the right (the vehicle inside) with its blades inclined to the right (toward the vehicle inside) and downwardly not to easily allow mud or water to enter the air intake port 2154 from above.<br>
[00196] As described above, the air intake duct 2150 to serve also as a heel guide member is attached to a front portion of the transmission case cover 236. Therefore, when the cooling fan 2118 attached to the fixed pulley half 277 of the continuously variable belt-type transmission 235 rotates, the outside air is introduced, as a cooling air, from the air intake port 2154 of the air intake duct 2150 into the continuously variable belt-type transmission chamber 270 via the air passage 2160. Thus, the case air intake port 236c, and the cooling air having cooled the continuously variable belt-type transmission 235 is exhausted from the case air exhaust duct 236d to the outside. [00197] If foreign matter such as mud or water enters the air passage 2160 through the air intake port 2154, the foreign matter is discharged to the outside through the drain passage 2170 formed by the projecting strips 2157 and 2167 and the projecting strips 2156 and 2166, so that foreign matter is prevented from entering the continuously variable belt-type transmission 270.<br>
[00198] The air intake duct 2150 serves as a heel guide member. The upper wall portions 2152u and 2162u projecting above the transmission case cover 236 make up a guide portion 2150u. As shown in Fig. 10, the guide portion 2150u is partly overlapped, as seen in a side view, by a rear end portion of the pillion step portion 215r of the step plate 215 and extends upwardly covering the concave 219 formed<br><br>
above the overlapped portion.<br>
[001991 In the air cleaner 225 disposed upward of the crankcase section of the internal<br>
combustion engine 230, a rear portion of a container 225a is laterally bulging to both<br>
sides, and an intake duct 225b extends forward from the left bulging portion along the<br>
left wall of the container 225a.<br>
[00200] A cleaner air intake port 225i which is opened at a front end of the intake duct<br>
225b is inwardly separated from the guide portion 2150u of the air intake duct 2150<br>
(see Figs. 12 and 13) and overlaps with the guide portion 2150u as seen in a side view<br>
(see Fig. 11).<br>
[00201] Thus, with the guide portion 2150u of the air intake duct 2150 covering, from<br>
outside, the cleaner air intake port 225i of the air cleaner 225, foreign matter, for<br>
example, mud or water is prevented from entering the air cleaner 225.<br>
[00202] The heel portion Fh of the passenger's foot F (shown in two-dot chain line in<br>
Fig. 10) placed on the pillion step portion 215r is guided in place by the guide portion<br>
2150u closing the concave 219 from an inner side of the vehicle.<br>
[00203] The air intake duct 2150 serving also as a heel guide member enables a cost<br>
reduction by decreasing the numbers of components and assembly man-hours required.<br>
[00204] The shroud 268 covering the periphery of the cylinder block 232 and cylinder<br>
head 233 of the intemal combustion engine 230 has a rectangular opening in its front<br>
end portion and, as shown in Figs. 11 to 14, the cylinder head cover 234 is fitted<br>
through and projecting forward from the rectangular opening. An upper wall 268u, a<br>
lower wall 268d, and a left wall 2681 extend rearwardly from the rectangular opening<br>
along the sides of the cylinder head 233 and cylinder block 232. The right wall 268r<br>
largely bulges rightward to be increasingly separated from the cylinder head 233 and<br>
cylinder block 232 until being connected to the fan cover 267.<br>
[00205] The fan cover 267 includes an annular frame 267a whose central axis is the<br><br>
crankshaft 240. A front peripheral portion of the annular frame 267a is screwed, with a screw 2120, to a rear end portion of the right wall 268r of the shroud 268. The portion other than the front peripheral portion of the annular frame 267a is fixedly bolted, with a bolt 2121, to a right edge portion of the right unit case 23IR. The fan cover 267 is regarded as an extension member of the shroud 268, and a cooling air intake port 267i is provided, facing the forced-cooling fan 266, in the right wall (see Fig. 14). [00206] A cooling air outlet port 268e is opened in a rear lower-half portion of the left wall 2681 of the shroud 268 with a front end portion of the air exhaust duct 269 connected to the cooling air outlet port 268e.<br>
[00207] The air exhaust duct 269 extends to the left from the cooling air outlet port 268e provided in the left wall 2681 and then is curved and further extends rearwardly and downwardly. The air exhaust duct 269 is partly fitted to the concave wall portion 236a of the transmission case cover 236, along the lower end surface of the air intake duct 2150 until reaching the step 236b of the transmission case cover 236 where a rear-end air exhaust port 269e is opened rearwardly and downwardly (see Figs. 11-13). [00208] The shroud 268 surroundingly covering the cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233 includes the cooling air intake port 267i provided in the fan cover 267 that is a rearward extension of the right wall 268r and the cooling air outlet port 268e formed in the left wall 2681 opposing the right wall 268r. Therefore, as seen in Fig. 14, the cooling air sucked in from the cooling air intake port 267i by the rotation of the forced-cooling fan 266 flows, while being diagonally forwardly guided by the curved right wall 268r, leftward passing around the peripheral portions of the cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233, thereby cooling the cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233. The cooling air having cooled the cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233 flows out of the cooling air outlet port 268e provided in the left wall 2681 without changing the flow direction.<br><br>
[00209] Thus, the cooling air flows evenly and smoothly, without becoming locally<br>
stagnant, through the inside of the shroud 268 unidirectionally from the cooling air<br>
intake port 267i to the cooling air outlet port 268e before being let out from the air<br>
exhaust duct 269. The cooling air can, therefore, cool the portions to be cooled of the<br>
cylinder block 232 and cylinder head 233 of the internal combustion engine 230<br>
thoroughly and efficiently. Furthermore, with the passage resistance being small and<br>
the cooling air volume being large, a great cooling effect can be expected.<br>
[00210] Referring to the side view shown in Fig. 11 of the power unit 210, the air<br>
exhaust duct 269 is located below the cylinder axis C - C that is the central axis of the<br>
cylinder bore of the cylinder block 232.<br>
[00211] Referring to the front view shown in Fig. 13 of the power unit 210, the air<br>
exhaust duct 269 is located, in the motorcycle width direction, approximately outside<br>
(to the right of, as seen in Fig. 13) the air cleaner 225 and inside (to the left of, as seen<br>
in Fig. 13) the outer surface of the transmission case cover 236.<br>
[00212] Thus, the air exhaust duct 269 is small and can be compactly installed on the<br>
left of the shroud 268 to extend along the lower end surface of the air intake duct 2150.<br>
This makes the air exhaust duct 269 less conspicuous resulting in better appearance.<br>
[00213] The cleaner air intake port 225i of the air cleaner 225 and the air intake port<br>
2154 of the air intake duct 2150 are both located higher than the cylinder axis C - C as<br>
seen in a side view (see Fig. 11).<br>
[00214] Namely, whereas the air exhaust port 269e of the air exhaust duct 269 is<br>
located below the cylinder axis C - C, the cleaner air intake port 225i and the air<br>
intake port 2154 are located higher than the cylinder axis C - C. Moreover, the air<br>
intake duct 2150 and the transmission case cover 236 exist between them.<br>
[00215] Therefore, the warm exhaust air coming out of the air exhaust port 269e<br>
below the air intake duct 2150 mostly flows rearward along the lower surface of the<br><br>
transmission case cover 236. If part of the exhaust air flows upward along the side surface of the transmission case cover 236, it is unlikely to be sucked into the cleaner air intake port 225i or the air intake port 2154. This can prevent the intake air temperature from rising and the cooling efficiency for the continuously variable belt-type transmission 35 from lowering.<br>
[00216] The air intake port 2154 is located, in the motorcycle width direction, between the cleaner air intake port 225i and the air exhaust port 269e of the air exhaust duct 269 (see Fig. 13).<br>
[00217] Therefore, if the engine cooling air exhausted from the air exhaust port 269e flows upward, for example, when the motorcycle is stopped, the exhaust air is likely to be led to the nearer air intake port 2154 before reaching the farther cleaner air intake port 225i, so that the exhaust air is quite unlikely to be sucked into the farther cleaner air intake port 225i. This can prevent the intake air temperature from rising. [00218] Furthermore, the air intake duct 2150 and the cleaner air intake port 225i are located to overlap with each other as seen in a side view, so that the guide portion 2150u serves as an external guide to securely prevent the engine cooling air exhausted from the air exhaust port 269e from being sucked into the cleaner air intake port 225i. This makes it more possible to prevent the intake air temperature from rising and foreign matter, for example, mud or water from entering through the cleaner air intake port.<br>
[00219] The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
