3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to semisynthetic process for the preparation of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel comprising condensation of protected 10-Deacetyl-baccatin-III (10-DAB) with 2S,3S-phenylsioserine as a source of C-13 side chain and replacement of 2'-hydroxy group from C-13 side chain using oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction by inversion of configuration.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Paclitaxel and Docetaxel are the most effective anticancer drugs found so far. Paclitaxel is extracted from the plant of yew trees, which has low extracting content and also belongs to the national protected plants; therefore the chemical synthesis methods for Paclitaxel and Docetaxel become the research directions for many scientists.<br><br>

There are various synthetic routes for preparation of paclitaxel such as by converting 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III (9-DHAB) into 10-deacetylbaccatin III. But main drawback of such process is poor yields of final product. Thus, there is a need of an efficient method for preparation of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel.<br>
US 6784304 describes method of preparation of novel oxazolidines which is used in the preparation of C-13 acyloxy sidechain-bearing taxanes such as paclitaxel and analogs thereof and a methods of preparing the oxazolidines, as well as to novel methods of<br><br><br>
coupling the oxazolidines to form the C-13 sidechain-bearing taxanes.<br>
US 6576777 provides a semi-synthetic process to convert a naturally occurring taxane into a suitable starting compound for the synthesis of paclitaxel and related compounds. It is related to a process for the conversion of 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III into a 7-protected baccatin III, which can be used for the synthesis of taxol derivatives, e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, cephalomannine and other taxanes, which were structurally related to baccatin III.<br>
US 2006/00795 Al describes semisynthesis of Paclitaxel involving esteirification of condensation of protected baccatin III with oxazolidine derivatives followed by hydrolysis and acidic treatment to give paclitaxel derivative.<br>
Most of the prior art methods for the semisynthesis of paclitaxel and Docetaxel involve condensation of baccatin III derivatives with oxazolidine derivatives with Cis-chirality. But these methods give low yield of the final product. Therefore, there is a need of semisynthetic methods of Paclitaxel/Docetaxel which is high yielding with high efficiency and can be carried out industrially at low cost with mild reaction conditions.<br>
In the semisynthetic method of the present invention, condensation of trans-chiral side chain is more synthetically suitable than Cis-side chain. The invention is suitable with mild reactive conditions for industrial production.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In one aspect of the invention, semisynthesis of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel comprises condensation 10-Deacetyl-baccatin-III (10-DAB) with 2S, 3S-phenylisoserine side chain at C-13 position.<br>
In second aspect of the invention, semisynthesis of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel comprises replacement of the configuration of side chain at 2'-OH group of condensation product by oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction followed by deprotection.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, semisynthesis of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel<br><br><br>
comprises condensation of 10-DAB with 2S,3S-phenylisoserine side chain at C-13 position.<br>
In the second embodiment of the present invention, configuration of 2'-OH in the C-13 side chain of the condensation product is inverted by oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction followed by deprotection to give Paclitaxel or Docetaxel.<br>
Paclitaxel or Docetaxel was synthesized through replacement of the configuration of side chain by oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction followed by deprotection of all other protecting groups.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the semisynthetic methods of Paclitaxel<br>
and Docetaxel provide the following steps:<br>
i) condensing protected 10-DAB of formula 1 with novel chiral side chain of formula 2 ;<br>
ii) deprotecting 2'-hydroxyl group to get compound in formula 4;<br>
iii) replacing 2'- hydroxyl group of  C-13 side chain of compound of formula 4 by<br>
oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction to give compound of formula 5; and<br>

(calculated in 10-DAB □) and the reaction is carried out at a temperature range of 30°C-40°C.<br>
In step ii) deprotection of 2'-hydroxyl group of C-13 side chain of compound 3 is carried out using alcohol preferably anhydrous alcohol and dilute acid such as hydrochloric acid to give compound of formula 4.<br>
In step iii) replacement of the configuration of 2'-hydroxyl group from the C-13 side chain of formula 4 is carried out using oxazoline reaction (for synthesis of Paclitaxel) using anhydrous pyridine and Vilsmeier reagent or using Mitsunobu reaction (synthesis of docetaxel) to give compound of formula 5.<br>
Deprotection of compound of formula 5 is carried out by refluxing in the mixture of acid and/or ethanol in the presence of catalyst such as zinc powder.<br>
In the semisynthetic method of the present invention, condensation of trans-chiral side chain is more synthetically suitable than cis-side chain. The invention is suitable with mild reactive conditions for industrial production.<br>

To a solution of compound la (50g) in 500mL of toluene, DCC (50g) and 50g of compound 2a was added. The mixture was stirred at 80°C for 8 hours. When the reaction was complete, water was added. The solution was filtered off to separate water, and extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate (l00mL x 2). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. 65 g of compound 3c were obtained by column chromatography.<br><br><br>

Abstract:<br>
A semi-synthetic method of Paclitaxel and Docetaxel involving oxazolination or Mitsunobu reaction of 2'-epi-intermediates wherein, 2'-epi-intermediates were synthesized based on the condensation reaction of protected 10-DAB III and novel chiral side chain of formula 2. Toluene and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) were used as solvent and as condensation agent respectively. The method is simple, assuring high yield and suitable for industrial production.<br><br></fq></td>
