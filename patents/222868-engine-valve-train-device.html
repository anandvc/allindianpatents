Engine Valve Train Device<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an engine valve train<br>
device in which a camshaft is driven to rotate by a crankshaft.<br>
Background Art<br>
For example, as valve train devices for motorcycle engines,<br>
there exists conventionally a valve train device having a<br>
construction in which a crankshaft sprocket provided on a<br>
crankshaft and an intermediate sprocket disposed in the vicinity<br>
of a camshaft are connected by way of a timing chain, so that<br>
an intermediate gear fixed to the intermediate sprocket meshes<br>
with a camshaft gear fixed to the camshaft (for example, refer<br>
to JP-A-6-66111).<br>
In the case of the construction in which the intermediate<br>
gear fixed to the intermediate sprocket is brought into mesh<br>
engagement with the camshaft gear, while a construction in which<br>
timing or alignment marks on the intermediate gear and the<br>
camshaft gear are caused to align with each other is adopted<br>
as a construction for carrying out valve timing, since the<br>
construction of the intermediate gear requires that the<br>
intermediate gear has a smaller diameter than that of the<br>
intermediate sprocket, in the event that the intermediate gear<br>
is disposed behind the intermediate sprocket, the alignment<br>
mark on the intermediate gear becomes difficult to be observed<br>
visually from the outside, and this causes a problem that the<br>
valve timing work becomes difficult to be carried out when an<br>
engine is assembled.<br>
Note that in case a construction is adopted in which an<br>
intermediate gear is disposed in front of an intermediate<br>
sprocket (for example, refer to JP-A-9-250314), while the valve<br>
timing work becomes easy to be carried out, a dimension from<br>
the camshaft gear to the cam nose, and an area surrounding the<br>
camshaft is enlarged accordingly and the torsional amount of<br>
the camshaft becomes large, leading to a problem that the valve<br>
timing control accuracy is reduced.<br>
The invention was made in view of the problems inherent<br>
in the conventional valve train device construction, and a<br>
problem that the invention is to solve is how to provide an<br>
engine valve train device which makes the valve timing work<br>
easy to be carried out while the intermediate gear is disposed<br>
behind the intermediate sprocket and which can improve the valve<br>
timing control accuracy while avoiding the risk that the area<br>
surrounding the camshaft is enlarged.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figs. 1 to 21 are drawings for describing an embodiment<br>
of the invention. In the drawings, reference numeral 1 denotes<br>
a water-cooled, 4-cycle, single cylinder, 5-valve engine, and<br>
in general, the engine has a construction in which a cylinder<br>
body 3, a cylinder head 4 and a cylinder head cover 5 are stacked<br>
on and fastened to a crankcase 2, and a piston 6 slidably disposed<br>
in a cylinder bore 3a in the cylinder body 3 is connected to<br>
a crankshaft 8 via a connecting rod 7.<br>
The cylinder body 3 and the crankcase 2 are securely<br>
connected together by screwing four case bolts 30a which pass<br>
through a lower flange portion (a case side flange portion)<br><br>
3b into a cylinder side mating surface 2e of the crankcase 2.<br>
To be more specific, the case bolts 30a are screwed into bolt<br>
connectingportions (connectingbossportions) 12c of iron alloy<br>
bearing brackets (bearing members) 12, 12' (which will be<br>
described later on) embedded in left and right wall portions<br>
of the aluminum alloy crankcase 2, respectively, through insert<br>
casting . Note that reference numeral 31a denotes a positioning<br>
dowel pin for positioning the crankcase 2 and the cylinder body<br>
3.<br>
In addition, the cylinder body 3 and the cylinder head<br>
4 are connected together with two short head bolts 30b and four<br>
long head bolts 30c. The short head bolt 30b is screwed to<br>
be planted in a portion below an induction port 4c and a portion<br>
below an exhaust port in the cylinder head 4, extends downwardly<br>
to pass through an upper flange portion 3f of the cylinder block<br>
3 and protrudes downwardly therefrom. Then, a cap nut 32a is<br>
screwed on the downwardly protruding portion of the short head<br>
bolt 30b, whereby the upper flange portion 3f and hence the<br>
cylinder body 3 are fastened to a cylinder side mating surface<br>
4a of the cylinder head 4.<br>
In addition, the long head bolt 3 0c is screwed to be planted<br>
in the lower flange portion 3b of the cylinder body 3, extends<br>
upwardly to pass from the upper flange portion 3f of the cylinder<br>
block 3 through a flange portion 4b of the cylinder head 4 and<br>
protrudes upwardly therefrom. Then, a cap nut 32b is screwed<br>
on the upwardly protruding portion of the long head bolt 30c,<br>
whereby the lower flange portion 3b and hence the cylinder body<br>
are fastened to the cylinder side mating surface 4a of the<br>
cylinder head 4.<br>
Thus, in connecting the cylinder body 3 and the cylinder<br>
head 4 together, since not only the upper flange portion 3f<br>
of the cylinder body 3 is fastened to be fixed to the cylinder<br>
head 4 with the short head bolts 30b and the cap nuts 32 but<br>
also the long head bolts 30c are planted in the lower flange<br>
portion 3b which is fastened to be securely connected to the<br>
mating surface 2e of the crankcase 2, so that the cylinder body<br>
3 is fastened to be fixed to the flange portion 4b of the cylinder<br>
head 4 with the long head bolts 30c and the cap nuts 32b, a<br>
tensile load generated by a combustion pressure comes to be<br>
borne by the cylinder body 3 and the four long head bolts 30c,<br>
so that a load applied to the cylinder body 3 can be reduced<br>
accordingly or by such an extent that the load is so borne by<br>
the cylinder body 3 and the long head bolts 30c. As a result,<br>
a stress generated at, in particular, an axially intermediate<br>
portion of the cylinder body 3 can be reduced, thereby making<br>
it possible to secure a required durability even in case the<br>
thickness of the cylinder body 3 is reduced.<br>
Incidentally, in the event that only the upper flange<br>
portion 3f of the cylinder body 3 is connected to the cylinder<br>
head 4, an excessively large tensile stress is generated at<br>
the axially intermediate portion of the cylinder body 3, and<br>
in an extreme case, there occurs a concern that a crack is<br>
generated at the portion in question. In the embodiment,<br>
however, the generation of the excessively large stress at the<br>
intermediate portion of the cylinder body can be avoided due<br>
to the presence of the long head bolts 30c, thereby making it<br>
possible to prevent the generation of a crack.<br>
In addition, in planting the long head bolts 30c in the<br>
lower flange portion 3b, since the long head bolts are disposed<br>
in the vicinity of the crankcase fastening case bolts 30a,<br>
respectively, the load generated by the combustion pressure<br>
can be transmitted from the cylinder head 4 to the crankcase<br>
2 via the long head bolts 30c and the cylinder body in an ensured<br>
fashion, thereby making it possible to improve the durability<br>
against the load in this respect.<br>
Here, as shown in Figs. 5, 16, the right-side bearing<br>
bracket 12' has a boss portion 12b in which a right-side bearing<br>
11a' of the crankshaft 8 is inserted to be fitted in a bearing<br>
hole 12a through press fit. Then, the bolt connecting portions<br>
12c, 12c extend upwardly from front and rear portions which<br>
hold the crankshaft 8 therebetween as seen in the direction<br>
in which the crankshaft 8 extends to the vicinity of the<br>
cylinder-side mating surface 2e of the crankcase 2.<br>
In addition, in the left-side bearing bracket 12, as shown<br>
in Figs. 5, 17, the bolt connecting portions 12c, 12c extend<br><br>
from front and rear portions which hold the crankshaft 8<br>
therebetween as seen in the direction in which the crankshaft<br>
8 extends to the vicinity of the cylinder-side mating surface<br>
2e of the crankcase 2 . In addition, a collar hole 12e is formed<br>
in the boss portion 12b into which an iron bearing collar 12d<br>
having an outside diameter larger than that of a balancer driving<br>
gear 25a, which will be described later on, is press fitted.<br>
Then, a left-side crankshaft bearing 11a is inserted to be fitted<br>
in the bearing hole 12a of the bearing collar 12d.<br>
Here, the bearing collar 12d is such as to facilitate<br>
the assembly of the crankshaft 8 in the crankcase 2 with a gear<br>
unit 25 having the balancer driving gear 25a being press fitted<br>
on the crankshaft 8.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, a seal plate 25d is<br>
interposed between the gear unit 25 on a left shaft portion<br>
8c of the crankshaft 8 and the bearing lla. An inside diameter<br>
side portion of the seal plate 25d is held by the gear unit<br>
25 and an inner race of the bearing 11a, and a slight gap is<br>
provided between an outside diameter side portion thereof and<br>
an outer race of the bearing lla for avoiding the interference<br>
therebetween. In addition, an inner circumferential surface<br>
of a flange portion 12h of the bearing collar 12d is brought<br>
into sliding contact with an outer circumferential surface of<br>
the seal plate 25d.<br>
Furthermore, a seal tube 17i is interposed between the<br><br>
bearing 11a' of a right shaft portion 8c' of the crankshaft<br>
8 and a cover plate 17g. An inner circumferential surface of<br>
the seal tube 17i is fixedly fitted on the right shaft portion<br>
8c' . In addition, a seal groove having a labyrinth construction<br>
is formed in an outer circumferential surface of the seal tube<br>
17i, and the outer circumferential surface of the seal tube<br>
17i is brought into sliding contact with an inner circumferential<br>
surface of a seal bore 2p formed in the right case portion 2b.<br>
Thus, the leakage of pressure within a crank compartment<br>
2c is prevented by interposing the seal plate 25d and the seal<br>
tube 17i on the outside of the bearings 11a, 11a' on the left<br>
and right shaft portions 8c, 8c' of the crankshaft 8.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the bolt<br>
connecting portions (the connecting boss portions) 12c, 12c<br>
which extend toward the cylinder body 3 side are integrally<br>
formed on the sides situated opposite across the cylinder bore<br>
axis A of each of the iron alloy crankshaft supporting bearing<br>
members 12, 12' which are insert cast in the aluminum alloy<br>
crankcase 2 and the case bolts 30a for connecting the cylinder<br>
body 3 to the crankcase 2 are screwed into the bolt connecting<br>
portions 12c, respectively, the load generated by virtue of<br>
the combustion pressure can be borne uniformly by the two front<br>
and rear bolt connectingportions 12c which are situated opposite<br>
across the cylinder bore axis A, whereby the connecting rigidity<br>
between the cylinder body 3 and the crankcase 2 can be improved.<br><br>
In addition, since balance shafts 22, 22' which are<br>
disposed in parallel with the crankshaft 8 in the vicinity<br>
thereof are supported by the iron alloy bearing members 12,<br>
12' at at least one ends thereof, the supporting rigidity of<br>
the balance shafts 22, 22' can be increased.<br>
Furthermore, in embedding the iron alloy bearing brackets<br>
12, 12' in the aluminum alloy crankcase 2, since the upper end<br>
face 12f of the bolt connecting portion 12c is positioned<br>
inwardly without being exposed to the cylinder side mating<br>
surface 2e of the crankcase 2, there is no risk that metallic<br>
members which are different in hardness and material exist in<br>
a mixed fashion at a joint between the crankcase 2 and the cylinder<br>
block 3, thereby making it possible to avoid a reduction in<br>
sealing capability. Namely, in the event that the upper end<br>
face 12f of the bolt connecting portion 12c abuts with a case<br>
side mating surface formed on the lower flange 3b of the aluminum<br>
alloy cylinder body 3, the sealing capability is reduced due<br>
to a difference in thermal expansion coefficients.<br>
In addition, in the left-side bearing bracket 12, since<br>
the bearing collar 12 having the outside diameter larger than<br>
that of the balancer driving gear 25a is attached to the outer<br>
circumference of the bearing 11a, when assembling the crankshaft<br>
8 in the crankcase 2 with the balancer driving gear 25a being<br>
attached to be fixed onto the crankshaft 8 through press fit<br>
or the like (or the balance driving gear 25a may of course be<br><br>
integrally formed on the crankshaft 8) , there is caused no risk<br>
that the balancer driving gear 25a is brought into interference<br>
with a minimum inside diameter portion of the boss portion 12b<br>
of the bearing bracket 12, and hence the assembling of the<br>
crankshaft 8 can be implemented without any problem.<br>
The crankcase 2 is a two-piece type in which the crankcase<br>
2 is divided into the left and right case portions 2a, 2b. A<br>
left case cover 9 is detachably attached to the left case portion<br>
2a, and a space surrounded by the left case portion 2a and the<br>
left case cover 9 constitutes a flywheel magnet compartment<br>
9a. A flywheel magnetic generator 35 attached to the left end<br>
portion of the crankshaft 8 is accommodated in this flywheel<br>
magnet compartment 9a. Note that the flywheel magnet<br>
compartment 9a communicates with a camshaft arranging<br>
compartment via chain compartments 3d, 4d, which will be<br>
described later on, whereby most of the lubricating oil which<br>
has been used to lubricate camshafts falls into the flywheel<br>
magnet compartment 9a via the chain compartments 3d, 4d.<br>
In addition, a right case cover 10 is detachably attached<br>
to the right case portion 2b, and a space surrounded by the<br>
right case portion 2b and the right case cover 10 constitutes<br>
a clutch compartment 10a.<br>
The crank compartment 2c and a transmission compartment<br>
2d are formed at front and rear portions of the crankcase 2,<br>
respectively. The crank compartment 2c is made to open to the<br><br>
cylinder bore 3a but is defined substantially to be separated<br>
from the other compartments such as the transmission compartment<br>
2d. Due to this, the pressure within the transmission<br>
compartment 2d is caused to fluctuate as the piston reciprocates<br>
vertically, thereby allowing the transmission compartment 2d<br>
to function as a pump.<br>
The crankshaft 8 is arranged such that left and right<br>
arm portions 8a, 8a and left and right weight portions thereof<br>
are accommodated in the crank compartment 2c. The crankshaft<br>
8 is an assembly including a left crankshaft portion into which<br>
the left arm portion 8a, weight portion 8b and shaft portion<br>
8c are integrated and a right crankshaft portion into which<br>
the right arm portion 8a, weight portion 8b and shaft portion<br>
8c' are integrated, the left crankshaft portion and the right<br>
crankshaft portion being connected integrally via a tubular<br>
crank pin 8d.<br>
The left and right shaft portions 8c, 8c' are rotationally<br>
supported on the side walls of the left and right case portions<br>
2a, 2b via the crankshaft bearings 11a, 11a'. As has been<br>
described above, the bearings 11a, 11a' are press fitted in<br>
the bearing holes 12a in the iron alloy bearing brackets 12,<br>
12' which are insert cast in the left and right case portions<br>
2a, 2b of aluminum alloy.<br>
A transmission 13 is accommodated and arranged in the<br>
transmission compartment 2d. The transmission 13 is such as<br><br>
to have a constant mesh construction in which a main shaft 14<br>
and a drive shaft 15 are provided and arranged in parallel with<br>
the crankshaft 8, and first-speed to fifth-speed gears 1p to<br>
5p attached to the main shaft 14 are made to constantly mesh<br>
with first-speed to fifth-speed gears 1w to 5w attached to the<br>
drive shaft 15.<br>
The main shaft 14 is rotationally supported by the left<br>
and right case portions 2a, 2b via main shaft bearings 11b,<br>
11b, whereas the drive shaft 15 is rotationally supported by<br>
the left and right case portions 2a, 2b via drive shaft bearings<br>
11e, 11c.<br>
A right end portion of the main shaft 14 passes through<br>
the right case portion 2b and protrudes to the right side, and<br>
a clutch mechanism 16 is attached to the protruding portion,<br>
and this clutch mechanism 16 is located within the clutch<br>
compartment 10a. Then, a large reduction gear (an input gear)<br>
16a of the clutch mechanism 16 meshes with a small reduction<br>
gear 17 fixedly attached to the right end portion of the<br>
crankshaft 8.<br>
A left end port ion of the drive shaft 15 protrudes outwardly<br>
from the left case portion 2 a and a driving sprocket 18 is attached<br>
to the protruding portion. This driving sprocket 18 is<br>
connected to a driven sprocket on a rear wheel.<br>
A balancer unit 19 according to the embodiment includes<br>
front and rear balancers 20, 20' disposed opposite across the<br><br>
crankshaft 8 and having substantially the same construction.<br>
The front and rear balancers 20, 20' include the balance shaft<br>
22, 22' which do not rotate and weights 24, 24 which are<br>
rotationally supported on the balance shat via bearings 23,<br>
23.<br>
Here, the balance shafts 22, 22' are also used as the<br>
case bolts (the connecting bolts) for connecting the left and<br>
right case portions 2a, 2b together in the direction in which<br>
the crankshaft extends. The respective balance shafts 22, 22'<br>
function to connect the left and right case portions together<br>
by causing flange portions 22a formed on insides of the<br>
rotationally supported weights 24 in a transverse direction<br>
of the engine to abut with boss portions 12g of the bearing<br>
brackets 12' , 12 which are insert cast into the left and right<br>
case portions 2a, 2b and screwing fixing nuts 21a, 21b on opposite<br>
ends of the respective balance shafts.<br>
The weight 24 includes a semi-circular weight main body<br>
24a and a circular gear supporting portion 24b which is<br>
integrally formed on the weight main body, and a ring-shaped<br>
balancer driven gear 24c is fixedly attached to the gear<br>
supporting portion 24b. Note that reference numeral 24b<br>
denotes a hole made by partially cutting away the material of<br>
a part of the weight 24 which is situated opposite to the weight<br>
main body 24a so as to reduce the weight of the part to as low<br>
a level as possible.<br>
17<br>
The balancer driven gear 24c attached to the rear balancer<br>
20' meshes with the balancer driving gear 25a which is<br>
rotationally attached relative to the gear unit 25 which is<br>
securely attached to the left shaft portion 8c of the crankcase<br>
8 through press fit.<br>
Note that reference numeral 25b denotes a timing chain<br>
driving sprocket integrally formed on the gear unit 15 and has,<br>
as shown in Fig. 11, an aligning or timing mark 25c for alignment<br>
of timing marks for valve timing. The gear unit 25 is press<br>
fitted on the crankshaft 8 such that the timing mark 25c aligns<br>
with the cylinder bore axis A as viewed in the direction in<br>
which the crankshaft extends when the crankshaft 8 is situated<br>
at a top dead center of a compression stroke.<br>
In addition, the balancer driven gear 24c attached to<br>
the front balancer 20 meshes with a balancer driving gear 17a<br>
which is supported rotationally relative to the small reduction<br>
gear 17 which is fixedly attached to the right shaft portion<br>
8c' of the crankshaft 8.<br>
Here, the rear balancer driving gear 25a is supported<br>
rotationally relative to the gear unit 25, and the front balancer<br>
driving gear 17a is supported rotationally relative to the small<br>
reduction gear 17. Then, U-shaped damper springs 33 each made<br>
up of a plate spring are interposed between the balancer driving<br>
gears 25a, 17a and the gear unit 25 and the small reduction<br>
gear 17, respectively, to thereby restrain the transmission<br><br>
of impact generated due to a torque fluctuation occurring in<br>
the engine to the balancers 20, 20' is restrained from being<br>
transmitted.<br>
Here, while the balancer driving gear 17a for driving<br>
the front balancer 20 will be described in detail by reference<br>
to Fig. 14, the same description would be given if the balancer<br>
driving gear 25a for driving the rear balancer were described.<br>
The balancer driving gear 17a is formed into a ring shape and<br>
is supported by a sliding surface 17b formed so as to have a<br>
smaller diameter than the small reduction gear 17 rotationally<br>
relative to a side of the small reduction gear 17. Then, a<br>
number of U-shaped spring retaining grooves 17c are formed in<br>
the sliding surface 17b by setting them back into the surface<br>
thereof in a radial fashion about the center of the crankshaft,<br>
and the U-shaped damper springs 33 are arranged to be inserted<br>
in place within the spring retaining grooves 17c. Opening side<br>
end portions 33a, 33a of the damper spring 33 are locked at<br>
front and rear stepped portions formed in a locking recessed<br>
portion 17d formed in an inner circumferential surface of the<br>
balancer driving gear 17a.<br>
When a relative rotation is generated between the small<br>
reduction gear 17 and the balancer driving gear 17a due to a<br>
torque fluctuation, the damper springs 33 resiliently deform<br>
in a direction in which the space between the end portions 33a,<br>
33a narrows so as to absorb the torque fluctuation so generated.<br><br>
Note that reference numeral 17g denotes a cover plate for<br>
retaining the damper springs 33 within the retaining grooves<br>
17c, reference numeral 17h denotes a key for connecting the<br>
small reduction gear 1 with the crankshaft 8, and reference<br>
numerals 17e, 17f denote, respectively, alignment marks for<br>
use in assembling the small reduction gear 17 and the balancer<br>
driving gear 17a.<br>
Amechanism for adjusting a backlash between the balancer<br>
driven gears 24c, 24c and the balancer driving gears 25a, 17a<br>
is provided on the balancers 20, 20'. This adjusting mechanism<br>
is constructed such that the balancer axis of the balance shaft<br>
22, 22' slightly deviates from the rotational center of the<br>
balancer driven gear 24c. Namely, when the balance shaft 22,<br>
22' is made to rotate about the balancer axis, the space between<br>
the rotational center line of the balancer driven gear 24c and<br>
the rotational center line of the balancer driving gear 25a,<br>
17a changes slightly, whereby the backlash is changed.<br>
Here, a mechanism for rotating the balance shaft 22, 22'<br>
differs between the front balancer 20 and the rear balancer<br>
20'. Firstly, in the rear balancer 20', a hexagonal locking<br>
protruding portion 22b is formed on a left end portion of the<br>
rear balance shaft 22', and a spline-like (apolygonal star-like)<br>
locking hole 26a formed in one end of a rotational lever 26<br>
is locked on the locking protruding portion 22b. In addition,<br>
an arc-like bolt hole 26b is formed in the other end portion<br><br>
of the rotational lever 26 in such a manner as to extend about<br>
the balancer axis.<br>
A fixing bolt 27a passed through the bolt hole 26b is<br>
planted in a guide plate 28. The guide plate 28 is generally<br>
formed into an arc-like shape and is fixedly bolted to the<br>
crankcase 2. Note that the guide plate 28 has also a function<br>
to control the flow of lubricating oil.<br>
The adjustment of the backlash of the rear balancer 20'<br>
is implemented by rotating the rotational lever 26 so as to<br>
bring the backlash to an appropriate state with the fixing nut<br>
21a being loosened and thereafter by fixing the rotational lever<br>
26 with the fixing bolt 27a and a fixing nut 27b, and thereafter,<br>
the fixing nut 21a is refastened.<br>
A grip portion 22f having an oval cross section, which<br>
is formed by forming a flat portion 22e on both sides of a<br>
cross-sectionally circular shape, is formed on a left end port ion<br>
of the front balance shaft 22 (refer to Fig. 12). A collar<br>
29a having an inner circumferential shape which matches an outer<br>
circumferential shape of the grip portion 22f is attached to<br>
the grip portion 22f, and furthermore, a holding portion 29b<br>
of a holding lever 29 is attached to an outside of the collar<br>
29a in such a manner as to move axially but as not to rotate<br>
relatively. A distal end portion 29e of the holding lever 29<br>
is fixed to a boss portion 2f of the left case portion 2a with<br>
a bolt 29f. In addition, a tightening slit 29c is formed in<br><br>
the holding portion 29b of the holding lever 29, so that the<br>
rotation of the collar 29 and hence of the balance shaft 22<br>
is prevented by tightening up the fixing bolt 29d. Furthermore,<br>
the fixing nut 21b is screwed on the balance shaft 22 to an<br>
outer side of the collar 29 so as to be secured thereto via<br>
washer.<br>
The adjustment of the backlash of the front balancer 20<br>
is implemented by loosening the fixing nut 21b or preferably<br>
removing the same, griping the grip portion 22f of the balance<br>
shaft 22 with a tool to rotate the shaft so as to bring the<br>
backlash to an appropriate state, and thereafter tightening<br>
up the fixing bolt 29d, and thereafter, the fixing nut 21b is<br>
fastened.<br>
In addition, a lubricating oil introducing portion 22c<br>
is formed in an upper portion of the locking protruding portion<br>
22b by cutting out the upper in an arc. A guide bore 22d is<br>
made to open to the introducing portion 22c, and the guide bore<br>
extends into the balance shaft 22 and passes therethrough to<br>
below an outer circumferential surface of the balance shaft<br>
22, whereby the lubricating oil introducing portion 22c is made<br>
to communicate with an inner circumferential surface of the<br>
balancer bearing 23. Thus, lubricating oil that has fallen<br>
in the lubricating oil introducing portion 22c is supplied to<br>
the balancer bearing 23.<br>
Here, while the weight 24 and the balancer driven gear<br><br>
24c are disposed at the right end portion along the direction<br>
in which the crankshaft extends in the front balancer 20, in<br>
the rear balancer 20' , they are disposed at the left end portion.<br>
In addition, the balancer driven gear 24c is located rightward<br>
relative to the weight 24 in both the front and rear balancers<br>
20, 20', and therefore, the weight 24 and the balancer driven<br>
gear 24c are set into the same configuration in both the front<br>
and rear balancers.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the weight main<br>
body 24a and the balancer driven gear 24c of the balancer 20<br>
are disposed on the right-hand side (one side) of the front<br>
balance shaft (the primary balance shaft) 22 along the direction<br>
in which the crankshaft extends and the weight main body 24a<br>
and the balancer driven gear 24c are disposed on the left-hand<br>
side (the other side) of the rear balance shaft (the secondary<br>
balance shaft) 22' along the direction in which the crankshaft<br>
extends, the reduction in balance in weight in the crankshaft<br>
direction that would result when providing a two-shaft balancer<br>
unit can be avoided.<br>
In addition, since the front and rear balance shafts 22,<br>
22' are made to double as the case bolts for connecting the<br>
left and right case portions 2a, 2b together, when adopting<br>
a two-shaft balancer unit, the connecting rigidity of the<br>
crankcase can be enhanced while restraining the construction<br>
of the engine from becoming complex and the number of components<br><br>
from being increased.<br>
Additionally, since the balancer weight main body 24a<br>
and the balancer driven gear 24c are made integral and are<br>
supported rotationally by the balance shafts 22, 22',<br>
respectively, only the weight made up of the balancer weight<br>
main body 24a and the balancer driven gear 24c may be driven<br>
to rotate, and therefore, the engine output can be attempted<br>
to be used effectively to such an extent that the balance shafts<br>
themselves do not need to be driven to rotate.<br>
In addition, the degree of freedom in assembling can be<br>
improved when compared with an engine construction in which<br>
a balancer weight and a balance shaft are made integral.<br>
Additionally, since the rotational center lines of the<br>
balancer driven gears 24c are caused to deviate relative to<br>
the axes of the balance shafts 22, 22', the backlash between<br>
the balancer driven gears 24c and the balancer driving gears<br>
25a, 27a on the crankshaft 8 side can be adjusted by the simple<br>
construction or only by a simple operation of rotating the<br>
balance shafts, thereby making it possible to prevent the<br>
generation of noise.<br>
On the front balance shaft 22, the backlash adjustment<br>
is implemented by gripping the grip portion 22f formed on the<br>
left-hand side of the balance shaft 22 with a tool so as to<br>
rotate the balance shaft 22, and on the rear balance shaft 22',<br>
the backlash adjustment is implemented by rotating the<br><br>
rotational lever 26 provided on the left-hand side of the balance<br>
shaft 22' . Thus, on either of the front and rear balance shafts<br>
22, 22', the backlash can be adjusted from the left-hand side<br>
of the engine, and hence the backlash adjusting work can be<br>
implemented efficiently.<br>
Additionally, since the balancer driving gear 17a on the<br>
crankshaft 8 side which meshes with the balancer driven gear<br>
24c is constructed to be disposed in such a manner as to rotate<br>
relatively to the sliding surface 17b of the small reduction<br>
gear 17 which is fixed to the crankshaft 8 and the U-shaped<br>
damper springs 33 are disposed in the spring retaining grooves<br>
17c formed by setting them back from the sliding surface 17b,<br>
the impact generated due to the torque fluctuation in the engine<br>
can be absorbed by the compact construction so that the balancer<br>
unit can be operated smoothly. Note that the same description<br>
can be made with respect to the balancer drive gear 25a.<br>
Furthermore, a coolant pump 48 is disposed at the right<br>
end portion of the front balance shaft 22 coaxially therewith.<br>
A rotating shaft of the coolant pump 4 8 is connected to the<br>
balance shaft 22 by an Oldham's coupling which has a similar<br>
construction to that of a lubricating oil pump 52, which will<br>
be described later on, in such a manner that a slight deviation<br>
between the centers of the rotating shaft and the balance shaft<br>
22 can be absorbed.<br>
In the valve train device of the embodiment, an intake<br><br>
camshaft 36 and an exhaust camshaft 37 which are disposed within<br>
the cylinder head cover 5 are constructed to be driven to rotate<br>
by the crankshaft 8. To be specific, a crankshaft sprocket<br>
( a crankshaft side driving wheel) 25b of the gear unit 25 press<br>
fitted on the left shaft portion 8c of the crankshaft 8 so as<br>
to be attached thereto and an intermediate sprocket (an<br>
intermediate driven wheel) 38a rotationally supported by a<br>
support shaft 39 planted in the cylinder head 4 are connected<br>
by a timing chain 40, and an intermediate gear 38 formed<br>
integrally on the intermediate sprocket 38a and having a smaller<br>
diameter than that of the intermediate sprocket 38a meshes with<br>
intake and exhaust gears 41, 42 secured to end portions of the<br>
intake and the exhaust camshafts 36, 37. Note that the timing<br>
chain 40 is disposed so as to pass through the chain compartments<br>
3d, 4d formed on the left walls of the cylinder block 3 and<br>
the cylinder head 4.<br>
The intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear<br>
38b are formed so as to be integrated into an intermediate<br>
rotational unit 38 and are rotationally supportedby the support<br>
shaft 39 which passes through the chain compartment 4d on the<br>
cylinder head 4 in the direction in which the crankshaft extend<br>
along the cylinder bore axis A via two sets of needle bearings<br>
44. The support shaft 39 is inserted from the outside of the<br>
cylinder head and is fixed at a flange portion 39a thereof to<br>
the cylinder head 4 with two bolts 39b. Note that reference<br><br>
numerals 39c, 39d denote a sealing gasket, respectively.<br>
Here, commercially available (standard) bearings are<br>
adopted for the two sets of needle bearings 44, 44. A space<br>
adjusting collar 44a is disposedbetween the respective bearings<br>
44, 44, and thrust washers (washer members) 44b, 44b for<br>
receiving thrust load to thereby restrict the axial position<br>
of the intermediate rotational unit 38 are provided at ends<br>
of the bearings . The thrust washer 44b is formed into a stepped<br>
shape having a large diameter portion which is brought into<br>
sliding contact with outer end faces of the intermediate sprocket<br>
and intermediate gear and a stepped portion 44c which protrudes<br>
axially toward the needle bearing 44. The space where the<br>
bearing 44 is arranged is regulated by the stepped portion 44c<br>
and the collar 44a.<br>
Thus, since the space adjusting collar 44a is interposed<br>
between the two sets of bearings 44, 44, commercially available<br>
standard bearings can be adopted for the needle bearings by<br>
adjusting the length of the collar 44a and the protruding amount<br>
of the stepped portion 44c, thereby making it possible to reduce<br>
costs. Note that in the event that only one needle bearing<br>
is used, the space where the bearing is arranged is adjusted<br>
by the protruding amount of the stepped portion 44c of the washer<br>
member.<br>
In addition, since the washer having the stepped<br>
configuration is adopted as the thrust washer 4 4b, the assembling<br><br>
work of the intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear<br>
38b (the intermediate rotational unit) can be improved. Namely,<br>
in assembling the intermediate rotational unit to the engine,<br>
while the support shaft 39 is inserted from the outside in a<br>
state in which the intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate<br>
gear 38b are disposed within the chain compartment 4d with the<br>
thrust washers being positioned at the ends of the intermediate<br>
sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear 38b in such a manner<br>
as not to fall therefrom, the thrust washer 44b can be prevented<br>
from falling by allowing the stepped portion 44c of the thrust<br>
washer 44b to be locked in a shaft hole in the intermediate<br>
sprocket 38a or the like, and hence the assembling properties<br>
can be improved.<br>
In addition, an oil hole 39e is formed in the support<br>
shaft 39 for supplying lubricating oil introduced from the cam<br>
compartment via an oil introducing bore 4e formed in the cylinder<br>
head 4 to the needle bearing 44.<br>
Additionally, four material cut-away weight reduction<br>
holes 38c and two inspection holes 38c adapted to be used at<br>
the time of assembling and made to double as material cut-away<br>
weight reduction holes are formed at intervals of 60 degrees.<br>
Then, an alignment or timing mark 38d is stamped on a tooth<br>
situated substantially at the center of the inspection hole<br>
38c' for the intermediate gear 38b, and timing marks 41a, 42a<br>
are also stamped on two teeth of intake and exhaust camshaft<br><br>
gears 41, 42 which correspond to the timing marks 38d. Here,<br>
when aligning the left and right timing marks 38d, 38d with<br>
the timing marks 41a, 42a, the intake and exhaust camshafts<br>
gears 41, 42 are located at positions, respectively, which<br>
correspond to a top dead center of a compression stroke.<br>
Furthermore, timing marks 38e, 38e are also formed at<br>
portions of the intermediate sprocket 38a which are situated<br>
on a cover side mating surface 4f of the cylinder head 4 when<br>
the timing marks 38d align with 41a, 42a.<br>
Here, the intermediate rotational unit 38 is disposed<br>
on a crankshaft side of the cylinder head 4 which is beyond<br>
the cover-side mating surface 4f thereof, and the intake and<br>
exhaust camshafts 36, 37 are disposed on an opposite side to<br>
the crankshaft side. Then, a portion where the camshaft gears<br>
and the intermediate gear mesh with each other is positioned<br>
at substantially the same height of the mating surface 4f, and<br>
therefore, the outer wall of the chain compartment 4d does not<br>
constitute an interruption when the meshing portion is subjected<br>
to visual inspection through the inspection holes 38'.<br>
Here, the intake and exhaust camshafts 36, 37 are<br>
rotationally supported by a camshaft carrier 80 in such a manner<br>
that the axes thereof are located at positions which are spaced<br>
away upwardly from the mating surface 4f of the cylinder head<br>
4. To describe in detail, the intake and exhaust camshafts<br>
36, 37 are mounted on a bearing portion of a carrier main body<br><br>
80a detachably attached onto the mating surface 4f and are held<br>
by a camshaft cap 80b on an upper side thereof.<br>
Note that, in Fig. 4, since a state in which the intake<br>
camshaft 36 is arranged is shown in an exploded fashion, while<br>
a bottom surface of the carrier main body 80a is illustrated<br>
as being spaced away from the mating surface 4a, in reality,<br>
the bottom surface of the carrier main body 80a coincides with<br>
the mating surface 4f, and this arrangement state is shown in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
To align valve timings, with the left case cover 9, the<br>
generator 35 and the cylinder head cover 5 being removed, firstly,<br>
the crankshaft 8 is held at a top dead center of a compression<br>
stroke by aligning the timing mark 25c (refer to Fig.11) with<br>
the cylinder bore axis A. In addition, the intermediate<br>
sprocket 38a and the intermediate gear 38b which are attached<br>
to the cylinder head 4 via the support shaft 39 are positioned<br>
so that the timing mark 38e of the intermediate sprocket 38a<br>
aligns with the cover side mating surface 4f, and in this state,<br>
the crankshaft sprocket 25b and the intermediate sprocket 38a<br>
are connected by the timing chain 40. Then, the intake and<br>
exhaust camshaft gears 41, 42 on the intake and exhaust camshafts<br>
36, 37 are brought into mesh engagement with the intermediate<br>
gear 38b while confirming through the inspection hole 38c' that<br>
the timing marks 41a, 42a align with the timing mark 38d on<br>
the intermediate gear 38b, and the intake and exhaust camshafts<br>
36, 37 are fixed to an upper surface of the cylinder head 4<br>
via the camshaft carrier 80.<br>
Thus, since the inspection holes 38c' made to double as<br>
the weight reduction holes to reduce the weight of the large<br>
diameter intermediate sprocket 38a are provided in the<br>
intermediate sprocket 38a, so that the alignment of the timing<br>
marks 38d on the small diameter intermediate gear 38b which<br>
is set on the back of the intermediate sprocket 38a with the<br>
timingmarks 41a, 42a on the camshaft gears 41, 42 can be confirmed<br>
through the inspection holes 38c', the meshing positions of<br>
the intermediate gear 38b with the camshaft gears 41, 42 can<br>
visually confirmed in an easy and ensured fashion while the<br>
small diameter intermediate gear 38b is placed on the back of<br>
the large diameter intermediate sprocket 38a, thereby making<br>
it possible to align the valve timings without any problem.<br>
In addition, since the intermediate gear 38b can be<br>
disposed on the back side of the intermediate sprocket 38a,<br>
the dimension from the camshaft gears 41, 42 which mesh with<br>
the intermediate gear 38b to a cam nose 36a can be made shorter,<br>
whereby the torsional angle of the camshaft can be made smaller<br>
to such an extent that the dimension is made so shorter, thereby<br>
making it possible to make compact an area surrounding the<br>
camshafts.<br>
Namely, for example, in a case where the intermediate<br>
gear 38b is disposed on a front side of the intermediate sprocket<br><br>
38a, while the valve timings can easily be aligned, the dimension<br>
from the camshaft gears 41, 42 to the cam nose becomes long,<br>
and the torsional angle of the camshafts becomes large to such<br>
an extent that the dimension is extended, thereby reducing the<br>
control accuracy of valve opening and closing timings.<br>
In addition, in a case where the intermediate gear 38b<br>
is disposed in front of the intermediate sprocket 38a, a space<br>
between the intermediate sprocket support shaft 39 and the<br>
camshafts 36, 37 needs to be expanded in order to avoid any<br>
interference between the intermediate sprocket 38a and the<br>
camshaft 36, 37, this causing a concern that the area surrounding<br>
the camshafts is enlarged.<br>
Additionally, since the intermediate rotational unit 38<br>
is arranged on the crankshaft side of the cylinder head 4 across<br>
the mating surface 4f of the cylinder head 4 with the cylinder<br>
head cover 5 and the camshaft gears 41, 42 are arranged on the<br>
opposite side to the crankshaft side, the meshing portion where<br>
the camshaft gears 41, 42 mesh with the intermediate gear 38b<br>
can be positioned in the vicinity of the mating surface 4f,<br>
and the meshing portion can easily be visually inspected from<br>
the outside.<br>
Namely, since the camshafts 36, 37 are disposed upwardly<br>
away from the mating surface 4f, while the intermediate sprocket<br>
38a and the intermediate gear 38b are positioned within the<br>
chain compartment 4d, the meshing portion is positioned in the<br><br>
vicinity of the mating surf ace 4f, and therefore, there is caused<br>
no risk that the outer wall of the chain compartment 4d<br>
constitutes an interruption when the meshing portion is visually<br>
inspected through the inspection holes 38c'.<br>
In addition, since the position alignment mark 38e which<br>
refers to the mating surface 4f as a reference surface is formed<br>
on the outer surface of the intermediate sprocket 38a, the<br>
angular positioning of the intermediate sprocket 38a which is<br>
needed in the first place when adjusting the valve timing can<br>
be implemented easily and securely.<br>
Additionally, since the camshaft carrier 80 is detachably<br>
attached to the cylinder head 4 and the camshafts 36, 37 are<br>
rotationally supported by the camshaft carrier 80, in the event<br>
that the camshafts 36, 37 are disposed upwardly apart from the<br>
mating surface 4f, there can be avoided a problem that the<br>
machining properties of the cylinder head mating surface 4f<br>
are reduced.<br>
Namely, in the event that the camshafts are disposed<br>
upwardly apart from the mating surface, since the camshaft<br>
bearing portion protrudes upwardly of the mating surface 4f,<br>
while the machining properties are reduced when compared with<br>
a case where the upper end surface of the cylinder head is flat,<br>
according to the embodiment, since the construction is adopted<br>
where the camshaft carrier 80 is detachably attached, the upper<br>
end surface of the cylinder head can be made flat and the machining<br><br>
properties can be improved.<br>
Additionally, since the intermediate sprocket 38a and<br>
the intermediate gear 38b are rotationally supported by<br>
disposing the intermediate sprocket 38a and the intermediate<br>
gear 38b within the chain compartment 4d and inserting the<br>
support shaft 39 so as to be disposed in such a manner as to<br>
extend across the chain compartment 4d, the supporting<br>
construction can be simplified and the assembling properties<br>
can be improved.<br>
Here, a backlash adjusting mechanism is provided between<br>
the intermediate gear 38b and the camshaft gears 41, 42. This<br>
adjusting mechanism has a construction in which the intake<br>
camshaft gear 41 and the exhaust camshaft gear 42 are made up<br>
of two gears such as a driving gear (a power transmission gear)<br>
46 and a shift gear (an adjusting gear) 45 and the angular<br>
positions of the driving gear 46 and the shift gear 45 can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
Namely, the shift gear 45 and the driving gear 4 6 are<br>
fixed to flange portions 36b, 37b formed at end portions of<br>
the camshafts 36, 37, respectively, in such a manner that the<br>
angular positions thereof can be adjusted by four<br>
circumferentially long elongated holes 45a, 4 6a and four long<br>
bolts 68a. A clearance portion 46b is cut and formed in the<br>
driving gear 46 that is disposed outwardly, and only the shift<br>
gear 45 is fixed in such a manner that the angular position<br><br>
thereof can be adjusted two elongated holes 45b and two short<br>
bolts 68b by making use of the clearance portion 46.<br>
A backlash adjustment is implemented according to the<br>
following procedure. Note that in the engine according to the<br>
embodiment, the intermediate gear 38b rotates counterclockwise<br>
as shown in Fig. 3 when viewed from the left-hand side of the<br>
engine. Consequently, both the intake camshaft gear 41 and<br>
the exhaust camshaft gear 42 rotate clockwise. In addition,<br>
here, while the backlash adjustment will be described with<br>
respect to the intake camshaft gear 41, the same description<br>
would be made with respect to the exhaust camshaft gear 42.<br>
Firstly, all the fixing bolts 68a, 68b of the intake<br>
camshaft gear 41 are loosened, and the shift gear 45 is rotated<br>
clockwise so that front side surfaces of teeth of the shift<br>
gear 45 in the clockwise direction slightly abut with rear side<br>
surfaces of teeth of the intermediate gear 38b in the<br>
counterclockwise direction. In this state, the shift gear 45<br>
is fixed to the flange portion 36b of the camshaft 36 with two<br>
short bolts 68b. Then, the driving gear 46 is rotated<br>
counterclockwise in such a manner that front side surfaces<br>
(driven surfaces) of teeth of the driving gear 46 in the<br>
counterclockwise direction abut with front side surfaces<br>
(driving surfaces) of the intermediate gear 38b in the<br>
counterclockwise direction so as to obtain a required backlash,<br>
and in this state, four long bolts 68a are tightened up, whereby<br><br>
the driving gear 46 and the shift gear 45 are fixed to the intake<br>
camshaft 36.<br>
Thus, since the intake and exhaust camshaft gears 41,<br>
42 are made up of the driving gear (power transmission gear)<br>
46 and the shift (adjusting gear ) 45 adapted to rotate relatively<br>
to the driving gear, respectively, the backlash can be adjusted<br>
by rotating the shift gear 45 relatively to the driving gear<br>
46 forward or backward in the rotating directions.<br>
Note that while, in this embodiment, both the driving<br>
gear 46 and the shift gear 45 which constitute the camshaft<br>
gears 41, 42 are described as being able to rotate relatively<br>
to the camshafts, one of the driving gear 46 and the shift gear<br>
45 may be adapted to rotate relatively and the other gear may<br>
be integrated into the camshaft. In this case, it is desirable<br>
that the gear integrated into the camshaft constitutes the power<br>
transmission gear. Even if constructed in this way, similar<br>
function and advantage to those obtained by the embodiment can<br>
be obtained.<br>
In addition, while, in the embodiment, the case has been<br>
described where the invention is applied to the valve train<br>
device which adopts the chain driving system, it goes without<br>
saying that the invention can also be applied to a valve train<br>
device which adopts a toothed belt driving system, and<br>
furthermore, the invention can also be applied to a valve train<br>
device in which the crankshaft and the intermediate gear are<br>
connected together via a gear train.<br>
Next, a lubricating construction will be described.<br>
A lubrication system 50 of the engine according to the embodiment<br>
is constructed such that lubricating oil stored within a separate<br>
lubricating oil tank 51 is picked up and pressurized by a<br>
lubricating oil pump 52 via a down tube 56c on a vehicle body<br>
frame, lubricating oil discharged from the pump 52 is divided<br>
into three systems such as a cam lubricating system 53, a<br>
transmission lubricating system 54 and a crank lubricating<br>
system 55 so as to be supplied to parts needing to be lubricated<br>
at the respective systems, and lubricating oil used for<br>
lubricating the respective parts needing lubrication is<br>
returned to the lubricating oil tank 51 by making use of pressure<br>
fluctuation occurring within the crank compartment 2c as the<br>
piston 6 reciprocates vertically.<br>
The lubricating oil tank 51 is formed integrally within<br>
a space surrounded by a head pipe 56a, a main tube 56b, the<br>
down tube 56c and a reinforcement bracket 56d of the vehicle<br>
body frame 56. This lubricating oil tank 51 communicates with<br>
a cross pipe 56e which connects lower portions of the down tube<br>
56c via the down tube 56c.<br>
Then, the cross pipe 56e communicates with a pick-up port<br>
of the lubricating oil pump 52 via an outlet tube 56f connected<br>
thereto, an oil hose 57a, a joint pipe 57b and apick-up passageway<br>
58a formed in a crankcase cover 10. A discharge port of the<br><br>
lubricating oil pump 52 is connected to an oil filter 59 via<br>
an oil discharge passageway 58b, an external portion connecting<br>
chamber 58c and an oil passageway 58d and is divided into the<br>
three lubrication systems 53, 54, 55 on a secondary side of<br>
the oil filter 59.<br>
The oil filter 59 is constructed such that an oil element<br>
59e is disposed in a filter compartment 59d defined by detachably<br>
attaching a portion of a cover 47 to a filter recessed portion<br>
10b provided in the right case cover 10 by setting part thereof<br>
further back from the rest.<br>
The cam lubricating system 53 has a construction which<br>
is generally constructed such that a lower end of a vertical<br>
member 53a of a T-shaped lubricating oil pipe is connected to<br>
a cam side outlet 59a of an oil passageway formed on the outside<br>
of the filter recessed portion 10b, whereas left and right ends<br>
of a horizontal member 53b of the lubricating oil pipe are<br>
connected to a camshaft oil supply passageway 53c, so that<br>
lubricating oil is supplied to parts such as bearings of the<br>
camshafts 36, 37 which need to be lubricated via the passageway<br>
53c.<br>
The transmission lubrication system 54 has the following<br>
construction. A right transmission oil supply passageway 54a<br>
formed within the right case portion 2b is connected to a<br>
transmission side outlet 59b of the oil filter 59, and the oil<br>
supply passageway 54a communicates with the interior of a main<br><br>
shaft bore 14a formed in the main shaft 14 along the axial center<br>
thereof via a left transmission oil passageway 54b formed in<br>
the left case portion 2a. Then, this main shaft bore 14a<br>
communicates with sliding portions between the main shaft 14<br>
and change-speed gears via a plurality of branch bores 14b,<br>
whereby lubricating oil supplied to the main shaft bore 14a<br>
passes through the branch bores 14b to be supplied to the sliding<br>
portions.<br>
In addition, an intermediate portion of the left<br>
transmission oil passageway 54b communicates with a bolt bore<br>
60a through which a case bolt 60 for connecting the left and<br>
right case portions 2a, 2b together is allowed to pass. This<br>
bolt bore 60a is such as to be formed by forming a bore having<br>
an inside diameter which is slightly larger than the outside<br>
diameter of the case bolt 60 in tubular boss portions 60c, 60c<br>
which are formed so as to face and abut with each other on the<br>
mating surface between the left and right case portions 2a,<br>
2b . The boss portion 60c is situated in the vicinity of a portion<br>
where a gear train on the main shaft 14 meshes with a gear train<br>
on the drive shaft 15, and a plurality of branch bores 60b are<br>
formed from which lubricating oil within the bolt bore 60a is<br>
spouted out toward the gear trains meshing portion. Note that<br>
the bolts 60 shown in Fig. 19 as being developed into the left<br>
and right case portions are the same bolt.<br>
Furthermore, a right end portion of the bolt bore 60a<br><br>
communicates with a drive shaft bore 15a formed in the drive<br>
shaft 15 along the axial center thereof via a communication<br>
bore 54c. Then, the drive shaft bore 15a is closedby a partition<br>
wall 15c at a left-hand side portion and communicates with<br>
sliding portions between the drive shaft 15 and driving gears<br>
via a plurality of branch bores 15b. Thus, lubricating oil<br>
supplied into the drive shaft bore 15a passes through the branch<br>
bores 15b to be supplied to the sliding portions.<br>
The crank lubricating system 55 has the following<br>
construction. A crank oil supply passageway 55a is formed in<br>
the filter cover 47 in such a manner as to extend from a crank<br>
side outlet 59c toward the lubricating oil pump 52, and the<br>
passageway 55 is made to communicate with a communication bore<br>
62a which is formed in a rotating shaft 62 of the lubricating<br>
oil pump 52 to pass therethrough along the axial center thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the communication bore 62a communicates with a<br>
crank oil supply bore 8e formed in the crankshaft 8 to pass<br>
therethrough along the axial center thereof via a connecting<br>
pie 64 . Then, this crank oil supply bore 8e communicates with<br>
the interior of a pin bore 65a in a crank pin 65 via a branch<br>
bore 8f, and the pin bore 65a is made to open to the rotating<br>
surface of a needle bearing 7b at a big end portion 7a of a<br>
connecting rod 7 via a branch bore 65b. Thus, lubricating oil<br>
filtered in the oil filter 59 is supplied to the rotating surface<br>
of the needle bearing 7b.<br><br>
The lubricating oil pump 52 has the following construction .<br>
A pump compartment 61c is provided in a right case 61b of a<br>
two-piece casing made up of left and right cases 61a, 61b by<br>
setting a relevant portion of the case further back from the<br>
rest, and a rotor 63 is disposed rotationally within the pump<br>
compartment 61. The rotating shaft 62 is inserted into the<br>
rotor 63 along the axial center thereof in such a manner as<br>
to pass therethrough to be disposed in place therein, and the<br>
rotating shaft 62 and the rotor 63 are fixed together with a<br>
pin 63a. Note that the oil pick-up passageway 58a and oil<br>
discharge passageway 58b are connected to a pump compartment<br>
upstream side and a pump compartment downstream side of the<br>
left case 61a, respectively. In addition, reference numeral<br>
66 denotes a relief valve for retaining the discharge pressure<br>
of the lubricating oil pump 52 to a predetermined value of lower<br>
and adapted to relieve the pressure on the discharge side of<br>
the lubricating oil pump 52 to the oil pick-up passageway 58a<br>
side when the pressure on the discharge side reaches or exceeds<br>
the predetermined value.<br>
The rotating shaft 62 is a tubular shaft which passes<br>
through the pump case 61 in the axial direction and opens to<br>
the crank oil supply passageway 55a at a right end portion thereof<br>
as shown in the drawing. In addition, a power transmitting<br>
flange portion 62b is formed integrally at a left end portion<br>
of the rotating shaft 62 as shown in the drawing. The flange<br><br>
portion 62b faces a right end face of the crankshaft 8, and<br>
the flange portion 62b and the crankshaft 8 are connected<br>
together by an Oldham' s coupling 67 in such a manner as to absorb<br>
a slight deviation of the centers of the shafts.<br>
The Oldham's coupling 67 is constructed such that a<br>
coupling plate 67a is disposed between the crankshaft 8 and<br>
the flange portion 62b, a pin 67b planted in the end face of<br>
the crankshaft 8 and a pin 67c planted in the flange portion<br>
62b are inserted into a connecting bore 67d in the coupling<br>
plate 67a.<br>
In addition, the connecting pipe 64 is such as to connect<br>
a right end opening in the crankshaft 8 to a left end opening<br>
in the rotating shaft 62, and sealing is provided by an oil<br>
seal 64a between the inner circumference of the crankshaft<br>
opening and the inner circumference of the rotating shaft opening<br>
and the outer circumference of the connecting pipe 64.<br>
Here, as has been described above, the crank compartment<br>
2c is defined separately from the other transmission compartment<br>
2d, the flywheel magnet compartment 9a and the clutch compartment<br>
10a, whereby an oil return mechanism is constructed in which<br>
the pressure within the crank compartment 2c is fluctuated to<br>
be positive and negative as the piston 6 strokes, so that<br>
lubricating oil in the respective compartments is returned to<br>
the lubricating oil tank 51 by virtue of the pressure<br>
fluctuation.<br><br>
To describe this in detail, a discharge port 2g and a<br>
suction or pick-up port 2h are formed in the crank compartment<br>
2c. A discharge port reed valve 69 adapted to open when the<br>
pressure within the crank compartment is positive is disposed<br>
in the discharge port 2g, and a pick-up port reed valve 70 adapted<br>
to open when the pressure within the crank compartment is<br>
negative is disposed in the pick-up port 2h.<br>
Then, the discharge port 2g communicates with the clutch<br>
compartment 10a from the crank compartment 2c via a communication<br>
bore 2i and then communicates with the transmission compartment<br>
2d from the clutch compartment 10a via a communication bore<br>
2j . Furthermore, the transmission compartment 2d communicates<br>
with the flywheel magnet compartment 9a via a communication<br>
bore 2k. A return port 2m formed so as to communicate with<br>
the flywheel magnet compartment 9a communicates with the<br>
lubricating oil tank 51 via a return hose 57c, an oil strainer<br>
57d and a return hose 57e.<br>
Here, a guide plate 2n is provided at the return port<br>
2m. This guide plate 2n has a function to ensure the discharge<br>
of lubricating oil by modifying the return port 2m so as to<br>
provide a narrow gap a between a bottom plate 2p and itself<br>
and to secure a wide width b.<br>
Additionally, an oil separating mechanism for separating<br>
oil mists contained in the air within the tank by virtue of<br>
centrifugal force so as to return oil mists so separated to<br><br>
the crank compartment 2c. This oil separating mechanism has<br>
a construction in which an introduction hose 72a which is<br>
connected to an upper portion of the lubricating oil tank 51<br>
at one end thereof is tangentially connected to an upper portion<br>
of a cone-shaped separating compartment 71 at the other end<br>
and a return hose 72b connected to a bottom portion of the<br>
separating compartment 71 is connected to the pick-up port 2h<br>
of the crank compartment 2c. Note that the air from which the<br>
oil mists are separated is discharged to the atmosphere via<br>
an exhaust hole 72c.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, since the crank chamber<br>
2c is made to be a substantially closed space so that the pressure<br>
therein fluctuates as the piston 6 reciprocates vertically,<br>
whereby lubricating oil that has flowed into the crank<br>
compartment 2c is sent back to the lubricating oil tank 51 by<br>
virtue of pressure fluctuation within the crank compartment<br>
2c, the necessity of an exclusive oil sending pump (a scavenging<br>
pump) can be obviated, and hence the construction of the engine<br>
can be simplified and costs can be attempted to be reduced.<br>
Inaddition, since the discharge port reed valve (anoutlet<br>
side check valve) 69 adapted to open when the pressure in the<br>
crank compartment increases and to close when the pressure lowers<br>
is disposed in the vicinity of where the oil sending passageway<br>
is connected to the crank compartment 2c, the lubricating oil<br>
within the crank compartment 2c can be sent back to the<br><br>
lubricating oil storage tank 51 in a more ensured fashion.<br>
In addition, since an portion above the oil level within<br>
the lubricating oil storage tank 51 is connected to the crank<br>
compartment 2 via the return hoses 72a, 72b and the discharge<br>
port reed valve (a pick-up side check valve) 70 adapted to open<br>
when the pressure in the crank compartment 2c lowers and to<br>
close when the pressure increases is provided in the vicinity<br>
where the return hoses are connected to the crank compartment<br>
2c, air required is picked up into the crank compartment 2c<br>
when the piston 6 moves upwardly, whereas the inside pressure<br>
of the crank compartment 2c increases as the piston 6 lowers,<br>
whereby lubricating oil within the crank compartment 2c can<br>
be sent tout in a more ensured fashion.<br>
Incidentally, in a case where there is provided no air<br>
supply path from the outside to the interior of the crank<br>
compartment 2c, only a negative pressure or a lower positive<br>
pressure is formed inside the crank compartment, this causing<br>
a concern that there occurs a case where oil cannot be sent<br>
out properly.<br>
Furthermore, since the centrifugal lubricating oil mist<br>
separating mechanism 71 for separating lubricating oil mist<br>
is interposed at the intermediate position along the length<br>
of the return passageways 72a, 72b, so that lubricating oil<br>
mist so separated is returned to the crank compartment 2c via<br>
the return hose 72b, whereas air from which the mist content<br><br>
is removed is discharged to the atmosphere, only lubricating<br>
oil mist can be returned to the crank compartment, whereby the<br>
reduction in oil sending efficiency can be avoided which would<br>
occur when an excessive amount of air is allowed to flow into<br>
the crank compartment, thereby making it possible to send out<br>
lubricating oil in the crank compartment in an ensured fashion<br>
while preventing the atmospheric pollution.<br>
In addition, since the lubricating oil pump 52 is disposed<br>
so as to be connected to the one end of the crankshaft 8 and<br>
the discharge port of the lubricating oil pump 52 is made to<br>
communicate with the crank oil supply bore (an in-crankshaft<br>
oil supply passageway) 8e formed within the crankshaft 8 via<br>
the communication bore (an in-pump oil supply passageway) 62a<br>
formed within the lubricating oil pump 52 and the connecting<br>
pipe 64, the lubricating oil can be supplied to the parts of<br>
the crankshaft 8 which need to be lubricated by the simple and<br>
compact construction.<br>
In addition, since the crankshaft 8 and the lubricating<br>
oil pump 52 are connected together by the Oldham's coupling<br>
67 which can absorb the displacement of the shafts in the<br>
direction normal thereto and the communication bore 62a and<br>
the crank oil supply bore 8e are made to communicate with each<br>
other via the connecting pipe 64 with the O rings 64a having<br>
elasticity being interposed between the connecting pipe 64 and<br>
the communicating bore 62a, the crank oil supply bore 8e, even<br><br>
in the event that the centers of the crankshaft 8 and the pump<br>
shaft 62 are caused to deviate slightly from each other,<br>
lubricating oil can be supplied to the parts needing to be<br>
lubricated without any problem, thereby making it possible to<br>
secure the required lubricating properties.<br>
Furthermore, since the tubular boss portion 60c is formed<br>
in the vicinity of the main shaft 14 and the drive shaft 15<br>
which constitute the transmission, the crankcase connecting<br>
case bolt 60 is inserted into the bolt bore 60a in the boss<br>
portion 60c so that the space between the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the bolt bore 60a and the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the case bolt 60 is made to form the lubricating<br>
oil passageway, and the branch bore (the lubricating oil supply<br>
bore) 60b is formed which is directed to the change-speed gears<br>
at the boss portion 60c, lubricating oil can be supplied to<br>
the meshing surfaces of the change-speed gears while obviating<br>
the necessity of providing an exclusive lubricating oil supply<br>
passageway.<br>
In addition, since the other end of the lubricating oil<br>
passageway defined by the inner circumferential surface of the<br>
bolt bore 60c and the outer circumferential surface of the case<br>
bolt 60 is made to communicate with an opening of the drive<br>
shaft bore (the lubricating oil passageway) 15a formed within<br>
the drive shaft 15 which is situated opposite to an outlet side<br>
of the bore, lubricating oil can be supplied to the portions<br><br>
on the drive shaft 15 which are brought into sliding contact<br>
with the change-speed gears while obviating the necessity of<br>
providing an exclusive lubricating oil supply passageway.<br>
Note that while the embodiment has been described as the<br>
invention being applied to a so-called DOHC engine which is<br>
provided with the intake camshaft and the exhaust camshaft,<br>
the invention can, of course, be applied to a so-called SOHC<br>
which is provided with a single camshaft which is made to function<br>
as both an intake camshaft and an exhaust camshaft as required.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, since<br>
the intermediate gear is made smaller in diameter than the<br>
intermediate driven wheel and is disposed behind the<br>
intermediate driven wheel and furthermore the inspection hole<br>
is formed in the intermediate driven wheel for visualizing the<br>
meshing portion where the intermediate gear and the camshaft<br>
gear mesh with each other, the meshing position between the<br>
intermediate gear and the camshaft gear can be visually observed<br>
easily and securely while the small-diameter intermediate gear<br>
is disposed behind the large-diameter intermediate driven wheel,<br>
thereby making it possible to carry out valve timing without<br>
any problem.<br>
In addition, since the intermediate gear can be disposed<br>
behind the intermediate driven wheel, the dimension from the<br><br>
camshaft gear which meshes with the intermediate gear to the<br>
cam nose can be made shorter, and therefore, the torsional angle<br>
of the camshaft can be reduced accordingly, thereby making it<br>
possible to improve the valve opening and closing timing control<br>
accuracy. In addition, the area surrounding the camshaft can<br>
be made compact.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, since<br>
the intermediate driven wheel and the intermediate gear are<br>
disposed on the crankshaft side across the mating surface of<br>
the cylinder head with the cylinder head cover, whereas the<br>
camshaft gear is disposed on the opposite side to the crankshaft<br>
side across the mating surface, the meshing portion where the<br>
intermediate gear meshes with the camshaft gear is positioned<br>
in the vicinity of the mating surface, thereby making it possible<br>
to facilitate the visual observation of the meshing portion<br>
from the outside.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, since<br>
the position alignment mark which refers to the mating surface<br>
as a reference surface is formed on the outer surface of the<br>
intermediate driven wheel, the alignment of the angular position<br>
of the intermediate driven wheel which is required in the first<br>
place in adjusting valve timing can be implemented easily and<br>
securely.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the camshaft carrier is detachably attached to the cylinder<br><br>
head and the camshaft is rotationally mounted on the camshaft<br>
carrier by means of the camshaft cap, there can be eliminated<br>
a problem of the machining properties of the cylinder head mating<br>
surface being reduced which would result when the camshaft is<br>
disposed on the opposite side to the crankshaft side across<br>
the mating surface in such a manner as to be apart from the<br>
mating surface.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the intermediate rotational unit into which the intermediate<br>
sprocket which is the intermediate driven wheel and the<br>
intermediate gear are integrated is disposed within the chain<br>
compartment formed on the side wall of the cylinder head and<br>
is rotationally supported by the support shaft which is inserted<br>
to be disposed across the chain compartment, the supporting<br>
construction of the intermediate rotational unit can be<br>
simplified and the assembling properties can be improved.<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the invention, since<br>
the washer member is disposed between the intermediate<br>
rotational unit and the wall surface of the chain compartment<br>
for regulating the axial position of the intermediate rotational<br>
unit and the axial arrangement space for the bearing,<br>
commercially available bearings can be adopted without any<br>
machining, thereby making it possible to reduce costs.<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the invention, since<br>
the camshaft gear is made up of the power transmission gear<br><br>
and the adjustment gear which is made to rotate relative to<br>
the power transmission gear, whereby the backlash is adjusted<br>
by causing the adjustment gear to relatively rotate forward<br>
in the rotating direction relative to the power transmission<br>
gear so that the tooth faces of the intermediate gear are held<br>
between the tooth faces of the adjustment gear and the tooth<br>
faces of the power transmission gear.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. An engine valve train device in which an intermediate driven wheel disposed<br>
in the vicinity of a camshaft is driven by a crankshaft-side driving wheel formed<br>
on a crankshaft and a camshaft gear fixed to the camshaft is driven by an<br>
intermediate gear disposed on a support shaft on which the intermediate driven<br>
wheel is disposed, the intermediate gear integrally rotating with the intermediate<br>
driven wheel, the engine valve train device being characterized in that a<br>
reduction ratio from the crankshaft-side driving wheel to the intermediate driven<br>
wheel is set larger than a reduction ratio from the intermediate gear to the<br>
camshaft gear, in that the intermediate gear is made smaller in diameter than the<br>
intermediate driven wheel to such an extent that a pitch circle of the intermediate<br>
gear passes substantially an intermediate between a diameter of a boss and a<br>
pitch circle of the intermediate driven wheel and the intermediate gear is<br>
disposed on a back side of the intermediate driven wheel, in that an inspection<br>
