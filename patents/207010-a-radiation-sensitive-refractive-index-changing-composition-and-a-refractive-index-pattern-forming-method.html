Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition, a refractive index pattern forming method, a refractive index pattern and an optical material- More specifically, it relates to a novel radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition which is used in the optoelectronic and display fields, a<br>
refractive index pattern forming method, a refractive index pattern and an optical material. Prior Art<br>
In the current society called "multi-media society", refractive index distribution type optically molded products each consisting of different refractive index regions are in great demand. The products include not only optical fibers for transmitting information but also optical diffraction gratings having a periodical change in refractive index, optical memories to which information is written at sites having different refractive indices, optically coupled elements such as optical IC's having a fine refractive index pattern, optical control elements, optical modulation elements and optical transmission elements.<br>
The refractive index distribution type optically molded products are divided into two types: one having a continuous refractive index distribution in the molded products, such as GI type optical fibers (to be referred to as "GRIN optically molded products" hereinafter) and the other having a discontinuous refractive index distribution, such as optical diffraction gratings and SI type optical waveguides.<br>
The GRIN optically molded products are attracting much<br><br>
attention as the next-generation optically molded products. For example, a GI type optical fiber whose refractive index is reduced from the center axis of the core of the optical fiber to the periphery in a parabolic form enables the transmission of a great volume of information, and a GRIN lens whose refractive index continuously changes therein is used as a reading lens for use in copiers, spherical lens for connecting fibers, or micro-lens, making use of its characteristic features that it has refractive power even with a flat surface and that it is free from spherical aberration.<br>
A large number of methods of producing the above GRIN optically molded products have been proposed up till now. For example, JP-A 9-133813, JP-A 8-336911, JP-A 8-337609, JP-A 3-192310, JP-A 5-60931 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexaminedpublished Japanese patent application" ), WO93/19505 and WO94/04949 disclose a method of obtaining a GI type optical fiber by dispersing low molecular weight compounds or a monomer into a polymer and continuously distributing its concentration. JP-A 62-25705 discloses that a GI type rod-like optically molded product or optical fiber is obtained by photo-copolymerizing two or more vinyl monomers having different refractive indices and reactivity ratio. Further, JP-A 7-56026 discloses a method of obtaining a refractive index distribution by forming a polymer A having an optically reactive functional group, dispersing a compound B having a lower refractive index than the polymer A into the polymer A to form the concentration distribution of the compound B and optically reacting the polymer A with the compound B.<br>
Some methods of producing GRIN optically molded products of an inorganic material have also been proposed. One of them is, for example, a method of producing a GI type rod by adding high-refractive index thallium to rod-like glass essentially<br><br>
composed of silicon or lead, immersing the glass in a molten solution containing low-refractive index potassium, and forming the concentration distribution of potassium by ion exchange.<br>
A GRIN lens can be obtained likewise by applying the above method to a short rod, that is, lens-like optically molded product. Alternatively, the GI type rod produced by the above method may be sliced.<br>
As one of methods of producing an optically molded product having a fine refractive index pattern, such as the above optical diffraction grating or optical IC, there is known a technology for obtaining a change in refractive index by causing a photochemical reaction in a molded product by irradiation. For instance, in the case of an inorganic material, glass doped with germanium is irradiated to change its refractive index so as to produce an optical diffraction grating. In the case of an organic material, the above technology is known as a photochromic reaction or photobleaching and JP-A 7-92313 discloses a technology for obtaining an optical diffraction grating by causing a change in refractive index by exposing a material obtained by dispersing low molecular weight compounds having photochemical reactivity in a polymer to a laser beam. Further, JP-A 9-178901 has recently proposed that this technology is applied to the production of a GRIN optically molded product. This method provides a continuous refractive index distribution in a depth direction with respect to irradiation, making use of the fact that light applied to a molded product is absorbed and weakened in intensity.<br>
However, in the refractive index distributions obtained with the above conventional materials , the maximum refractive index difference is about 0.001 to 0.02 at best and it is difficult to provide a wider refractive index distribution in order to prevent an optical loss and suppress the malfunction<br><br>
of a circuit.<br>
When a refractive index difference is created by irradiation, if the above conventional materials are used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough after a refractive index distribution is formed, it will be impossible to prevent such a phenomenon that a gradual change in refractive index occurs, thereby deteriorating the materials. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above problems of the prior art.<br>
That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition whose refractive index is changed by a simple method, whose changed refractive index difference is sufficiently large, and which can provide a stable refractive index pattern and a stable optical material regardless of use conditions.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition which provides a refractive index pattern having high film strength by exposure to radiation.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of forming a refractive index pattern from the above composition of the present invention.<br>

dissolved or dispersed in a solvent to prepare a composition having a solid content of 5 to 70 wt%. The composition may be filtered with a filter having an opening diameter of about 0.1 to 10 pm as required before use.<br>
Thereafter, this composition is applied to the surface of a substrate such as a silicon wafer and heated (to be referred to as "prebaked" hereinafter) to remove the solvent so as to form a coating film of the refractive index changing composition.

The refractive index changing composition used in the present invention is formed into various shapes in consideration of application purpose before exposure to<br><br>
radiation. For example, it is formed like a rod, fiber, long plate, sphere, film or lens and the present invention is not limited to these. A commonly used method may be used to mold the refractive index changing composition of the present invention. For example, injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, In-case frame polymerization, shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering or scanning is employed.  Spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used according to the application purpose of an optically molded product.<br>
In this molding process, prebaking is preferably carried out. The prebaking condition which changes according to the composition of the material of the present invention and the type of each additive is preferably 30 to 200** C, more preferably 40 to ISO^'C. A hot plate or oven, or infrared radiation may be used for heating.<br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-ray having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-ray having a wavelength of 404 nm, g-ray having a wavelength of 436 nm, ultraviolet ray from a wide-range wavelength light source such as a xenon lamp, far ultraviolet ray such as KrF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm. X-ray such as synchrotron radiation, charged corpuscular beam such as electron beam, visible ray or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1 to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is obtained. Irradiation of these radiations through a pattern mask makes possible the patterning of the radiation sensitive refractive index changing material. As for patterning accuracy which is affected by a light source used, an optical<br><br>
part having a refractive index variation distribution with a resolution of about 0.2 μm can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, heating (to be referred to as "post-exposure baking (PEB)") is preferably carried out after exposure.  A similar device to the above prebaking device may be used for PEB and PEB conditions may be arbitrary. The heating temperature is preferably 30 to 150oc, more preferably 30 to 130oC.

Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>
The re-exposure may be carried out by the application of radiation having the same wavelength as the radiation used to change the refractive index onto the entire surface of the pattern in the same amount.<br>
Optionally, the stability of the material can be further improved by heating. A similar device to the prebaking device used at the time of molding the material may be used for heating and the heating conditions may be arbitrary.<br>
According to the present invention, the refractive index pattern forming method of the present invention may also be carried out by exposing a refractive index changing composition comprising the above components (A), (B) and (C) to radiation through a pattern mask and treating it with a stabilizer (D).<br>
The treatment with the stabilizer (D) is preferably carried out after post-exposure baking.<br>
The stabilizer (D) has the function of stabilizing the<br><br>
residual decomposable compound (A) existent in the refractive index changing material after exposure to provide stability to an acid or base. This stabilization prevents a change in the refractive index and hence the deterioration of a refractive index pattern formed by the method of the present invention even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough.<br>
A low-boiling compound such as ammonia or triethylamine may be used as the stabilizer (D) besides the above examples.<br>
For contact between the refractive index changing composition after exposure to radiation and the stabilizer (D) for stabilization, a suitable method may be employed. For instance, the component (D) and optionally a catalyst are dissolved in a suitable solvent to be contacted to the refractive index changing composition as a solution. Alternatively, when the component (D) is liquid or gas under contact conditions, it may be 100 % directly contacted to the refractive index changing composition.<br>
When a solvent is used in the reaction between the above stabilizer (D) and the component (A), the solvent preferably dissolves the component (D) and an optionally added catalyst and does not dissolve the component (A) . If the above solvent is selected, the surface of the obtained refractive index pattern will not be roughened.<br>

Out of these solvents, water, alcohols, glycol ethers, ethylene glycol alkyl ether acetates and fluorine atom-containing solvents are preferred.<br>
The reaction temperature for carrying out a reaction between the stabilizer (D) and the residual decomposable<br><br>
compound (A) is generally 0 to 130oC, and the reaction time is generally 10 seconds to 1 hour.<br>
Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>
As for what is not described of the refractive index pattern forming method including the above stabilization, it should be understood that the above description of the refractive index pattern forming method is applied directly or with modifications obvious to people having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the refractive index pattern forming method of the present invention may also be carried out by exposing the refractive index changing composition comprising the above components (A), (B) and (C) to radiation through a pattern and heating to decompose the decomposable compound (A) of an unexposed portion.<br>
The above heating is preferably carried out at a temperature 10oC or more higher than the PEB temperature, for example, preferably 170oC or more, more preferably 200oC or more.<br>
By the above heating, the residual decomposable compound (A) existent in the unexposed portion is removed by decomposition or sublimation.<br>
As for what is not described of the above refractive index pattern forming method when the component (D) is not contained, it should be understood that related items out of the above description of the pattern forming method are applied directly or with modifications obvious to people having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In the refractive index pattern of the present invention formed by any one of the above methods, the refractive index of an exposed portion (first region) is preferably higher<br><br>
than that of an unexposed portion (second region). This difference can be adjusted to a desired value by controlling the types and contents of the components (A) and (B) in the refractive index changing composition used in the present invention. For example, the largest value of refractive index difference can be set to a value larger than 0.02.<br>
Since the refractive index pattern of the present invention does not deteriorate without a change in refractive index even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough as described above, it is extremely useful as an optical material for use in the optoelectronic and display fields.<br>
As the refractive index pattern of the present invention has a sufficiently large refractive index difference and the created refractive index difference is stable to light and heat, it is extremely useful as an optical material for use in the optoelectronic and display fields.

A commonly used method may be used to mold the photo-sensitive refractive index changing composition, as exemplified by injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, in-case frame polymerization, shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering and scanning.  Spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used according to the application purpose of an optically molded product.<br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-ray having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-ray having a wavelength of 404 nm, g-ray having a wavelength of 436 nm, ultraviolet ray from a wide-range wavelength light source such as a xenon lamp, far ultraviolet ray such as KrF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm. X-ray such as synchrotron radiation, charged corpuscular beam such as electron beam, visible radiation or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1 to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is obtained. Irradiation of these radiations through a pattern mask makes possible the patterning of the radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition. As for patterning accuracy which is affected by a light source used, an optical part having a refractive index variation distribution with a resolution of about 0.2 μm can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, heating (to be referred to as "post-exposure baking (FEB)" hereinafter) is preferably carried out after exposure. The heating condition which changes according to the composition of the material of the present invention and the type of each additive is preferably<br><br>

As specific examples, the methods of forming a lens, optical waveguide, diffraction grating, hologram element and recording medium will be described in detail. <method of forming a lens><br>
The lens of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method. (1) method of forming a GRIN lens having concave lens power<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition used for the formation of a lens may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use. The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200' C and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 50 to 80 %. This solution is formed into a disk having a desired shape by a hot press or the like.<br>
Thereafter, the disk is exposed to light in such a manner that the amount of exposure is large at the center portion of the disk and decreases toward the periphery of the disk and then baked to form a GRIN lens having concave lens power. The exposure device is such as shown in Fig. 1. The diaphragm 2 which can be opened or closed of the exposure device of Fig. 1 is installed in front of a disk sample (L&gt; only parallel<br>
rays from the above light (3) source are applied to the sample by gradually opening the closed diaphragm(2) and the shutter speed is adjusted such that the diaphragm (2) is fully opened in 1 second to 5 minutes to achieve the above exposure state. The FEB conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200oC and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br><br>
(2) method of forming a GRIN lens having convex lens power<br>
A similar disk sample to that described above (1) is exposed to light in such a manner that the amount of exposure is large at the periphery of the disk and decreases toward the center of the disk and then baked to form a GRIN lens having convex lens power.<br>
This exposure state can be obtained by inputting light (3) uniformly from the side only while the top and bottom portions of the cylinder are shielded from light (4). An optical fiber or reflector may be used for uniform exposure from the side.<br>
The same PEB conditions as (1) above may be employed. <method of forming an optical waveguide><br>
The optical waveguide of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition for the formation of an optical waveguide may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use (solution A). The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200** C and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 20 to 60 %.<br>
Separately from this solution, a composition solution comprising the component (B) and a heat acid generator and/or an photo acid generator is prepared (solution B). The solid content of this solution may be 20 to 60 % and a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200oC may be used.<br>
The solution B is first applied to a suitable substrate such as a silicon substrate or glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a coating film as thick as 1 to 50 pm. This coating film serves as a lower clad layer. Spin coating or slit coating may be employed to apply the solution B and heating may be carried out at 50 to 150oC for 1 to 30 minutes to remove the solvent.<br>
Thereafter, the solution A is applied to the lower clad layer formed as described above and then the solvent is removed<br><br>
to form an intermediate layer as thick as 1 to 50 μm. The coating method and the solvent removing conditions may be the same as described above.<br>
Subsequently, the intermediate layer is exposed to light through a photomask for shielding the core portion of a waveguide pattern from light and baked. The unexposed portion serves as a core portion and the exposed portion serves as a side clad layer. The PEB conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200o C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br>
The solution B is applied to the above intermediate layer again and then the solvent is removed to form an upper clad layer as thick as 1 to 50 μm, thereby making it possible to form an optical waveguide. Since the obtained optical waveguide contains the heat acid generator in the upper and lower clad layers, an acid slightly formed is diffused at the interfaces between the core layer and the lower clad layer and between the core layer and the upper clad layer. Thereby, the interfaces between the core layer and the clad layers can take such a structure that the refractive index changes gradually in the upper, side and lower portions with the result that a GI type optical waveguide is obtained. <method of forming a recording medium><br>
The recording medium of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition for the formation of a recording medium may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use. The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200oC, and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 5 to 50 %.<br>
This solution is applied to a flat plastic substrate having a metal film such as an aluminum film having a thickness of about 60 nm and then the solvent is removed to form a coating film as thick as 0.1 to 10 μm. Spin coating or slit coating may be used to apply the solution, and the solvent can be<br><br>
removed by heating at 50 to 150o C for 1 to 30 minutes-<br>
Thereafter, this coating film is exposed to light through a photomask having a track pick of 1.6 iim at a pitch width of 0.2 to 0• 5 μm and baked to form an optical recording medium. The FEB conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200o0 and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes. <method of forming a diffraction grating><br>
The diffraction grating of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for exsunple, the following method.<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition for the formation of a diffraction grating may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use. The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200oC, and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 20 to 60 %.<br>
This solution is applied to the surface of a suitable substrate such as a glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a thin coating film as thick as 1 to 50 μm. Spin coating or slit coating may be used to apply the solution, and the solvent can be removed by heating at 50 to 150oC for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
This coating film is exposed to light (9) in a slit form and baked to form a diffraction grating. To apply slit-form light, for example, the method shown in Pig. 2 may be employed. Fig. 2 shows that parallel rays reflected by a reflector (7) placed obliquely are applied to a coating film. The coating film (6) is exposed to an interference pattern foirmed by direct rays and reflected rays. The sample (5) is moved in a direction shown by an arrow in the figure at a speed of 0.1 to 100 iim/min while it is illuminated (8) to form a diffraction grating having a desired cycle of 0.3 μm or more. A fine refractive index distribution can be provided by this method.<br>
Another method of applying slit-form light is to apply a plurality of radial rays to the coating film formed as<br><br>
described above from different directions for interference or to apply them through slits.  In either method, a diffraction grating having a desired cycle can be formed by changing the input angle of light or the angle of a mirror.<br>
The above PEB conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200oC and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes. <method of forming a hologram element><br>
The hologram element of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition for the formation of a hologram element may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use. The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200oC, and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 20 to 60 %.<br>
This solution is applied to the surface of a suitable substrate such as a glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a thin coating film as thick as 1 to 50 μm. Spin coating or slit coating may be used to apply the solution, and the solvent can be removed by heating at 50 to 150oC for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
This coating film is exposed to an interference pattern and baked to form a recording medium (hologram) for holography. That is, signal light passing through a subject to be recorded and reference light directly obtained from the same light source are interfered with each other and applied to the coating film to change its refractive index, thereby making it possible to record an image of the subject on the coating film.<br>
The above PEB conditions include heating at a temperature of 50 to 200oC and for a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br>
