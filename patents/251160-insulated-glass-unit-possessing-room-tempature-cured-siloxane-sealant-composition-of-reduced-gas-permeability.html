PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is generally related to thermally insulating structures, and more particularly to a high thermal efficiency, insulated glass unit structure sealed with room temperature cured compositions having reduced permeability to gas, or mixtures of gases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insulating glass units (IGU) commonly have two panels of glass separated by a spacer. The two panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with air. The transfer of energy through an insulating glass unit of this typical construction is reduced, due to the inclusion of the insulating layer of air in the inner space, as compared to a single panel of glass. The energy transfer may be further reduced by increasing the separation between the panels to increase the insulating blanket of air. There is a limit to the maximum separation beyond which convection within the air between the panels can increase energy transfer. The energy transfer may be further reduced by adding more layers of insulation in the form of additional inner spaces and enclosing glass panels. For example three parallel spaced apart panels of glass separated by two inner spaces and sealed at their periphery. In this manner the separation of the panels is kept below the maximum limit imposed by convection effects in the airspace, yet the overall energy transfer can be further reduced. If further reduction in energy transfer is desired then additional inner spaces can be added.<br>
Additionally, the energy transfer of sealed insulating glass units may be reduced by substituting the air in a sealed insulated glass window for a denser, lower conductivity gas. Suitable gases should be colorless, non-toxic, non-corrosive, non¬flammable, unaffected by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and denser than air, and of lower conductivity than air. Argon, krypton, xenon, and sulfur hexaflouride are examples of gases which are commonly substituted for air in insulating glass windows to reduce energy transfer.<br>
-2-<br><br>
Various types of sealants are currently used in the manufacture of insulated glass units including both curing and non-curing systems. Liquid polysulphides, polyurethanes and silicones represent curing systems, which are commonly used, while polybutylene-polyisoprene copolymer rubber based hot melt sealants are commonly used non-curing systems.<br>
Liquid polysulphides and polyurethanes are generally two component systems comprising a base and a curing agent that are then mixed just prior to application to the glass. Silicones may be one component as well as two component systems. Two component systems require a set mix ratio, two-part mixing equipment and cure time before the insulating glass units can be moved onto the next manufacturing stage.<br>
However, these sealant compositions are susceptible to permeability from the low conductivity energy transfer gases (e.g. argon) used to enhance the performance of insulated glass units. As a result of this permeability, the reduced energy transfer maintained by the gas between the panels of glass is lost over time.<br>
There remains a need for sealants with superior barrier protection and even higher thermal insulation stability that overcomes the deficiencies described above, and is highly suitable for applications that are easy to apply and have excellent adhesion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an insulated glass unit with increased thermal insulation stability. Specifically, the present invention relates to an insulated glass unit comprising at least two spaced-apart sheets of glass in spaced relationship to each other, a low thermal conductivity gas therebetween and gas sealant element including a curable sealant composition comprised of a) diorganopolysiloxane exhibiting permeability to said gas; b) at least one polymer having a permeability to said gas that is less than the permeability of diorganopolysiloxane polymer; c) cross-linker; and, d) catalyst for the cross-linker reaction.<br>
-3-<br><br>
The curable sealant composition of the present invention advantageously provides for a 50 percent reduction in gas permeability and reduced moisture leakage, which provides longer service life of insulated glass units (IGU).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limited, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1 an insulated glass unit 10 incorporating a curable sealant composition 7 providing separation of adjacent panes 1, 2 and sealing of the gas impermeable space 6 therebetween is shown. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the inventive concepts of the present curable sealant composition 7 may be applied in various manners without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, it is contemplated that the present curable sealant composition may be used in conjunction with other materials, for example, various types of glass, including, clear float glass, annealed glass, tempered glass, solar glass, tinted glass, and Low-E glass, acrylic sheets and polycarbonate sheets.<br>
-4-<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, the curable sealant composition 7 is applied in the construction of an insulated glass unit with a double pane glass structure. The insulated glass unit,- therefore, generally includes a first glass pane 1 and a second glass pane 2 separated by a continuous spacer 5, a primary sealant 4, and curable sealant composition 7 positioned between the first glass pane 1 and the second glass pane 2. The use of curable sealant composition 7 in accordance with the present invention provides improved gas barrier characteristics and moisture leakage characteristics. As a result, the curable sealant composition 7 provides for longer in service performance of insulated glass units.<br>
The dimensions of continuous spacer 5 will determine the size of the gas impermeable space 6 formed between the first glass 1 and second glass 2 when the sheets of glass are sealed to spacer 5 using primary sealant 1 and curable sealant composition 7 of the present invention. A glazing bead 8, as known in the art, is placed between glass sheets 1 and 2 and window frame 9.<br>
The spacer 5 may be filled with a desiccant that will keep the sealed interior of the gas impermeable space 6 of the insulated glass unit dry. The desiccant should be one which will not adsorb the low thermal conductivity gas or other gases used if a gas mixture is used to fill the interior of the insulated glass unit.<br>
The primary sealant 4 of the insulated glass unit may be comprised of polymeric materials as known in the art. For example, rubber base material, such as polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, polysulfide, EPDM rubber nitrile rubber, or the like. Other materials include, but are not limited to, compounds comprising polyisobutylene/polyisoprene copolymers, polyisobutylene polymers, brominated olefin polymers, copolymers of polisobutylene and para-methyl styrene, copolymers of polyisobutylene and brominated para-methylstyrene, butyl rubber-copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene, ethylene-propylene polymers, polysulfide polymers, polyurethane polymers, and styrene butadiene polymers.<br>

As recited above, the primary sealant 4 can be fabricated of a material such as polyisobutylene, which has very good sealing properties. The glazing bead 8 is a sealant that is sometimes referred to as the glazing bedding and may be in the form of a silicone or butyl. A desiccant may be built into the continuous spacer 5 and is intended to remove moisture from the insulated glass or gas impermeable space between glass pane 1 and glass pane 2.<br>
