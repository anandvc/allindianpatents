CONTAINER FOR STORAGE AND POURING OF LIQUIDS<br>
The invention relates to a container, especially a<br>
bottle, for the storage and pouring of liquids with an internal<br>
volume and a pouring opening, whereby the internal volume is<br>
subdivided into a storage volume and a withdrawal volume which are<br>
interconnected so that in a normal vertical position of the<br>
container, the withdrawal volume is arranged above the storage<br>
volume and an overflow of liquid from the storage volume into the<br>
withdrawal volume is prevented until the container is tilted beyond<br>
the predetermined limiting angle from the vertical position.<br>
The subdivision of the container volume into a storage<br>
volume and a withdrawal volume can be effected for example by a<br>
partition which is provided within the container volume. Such a<br>
partition can, for example, in an upright bottle-shaped container<br>
extend horizontally in the interior of the container above the<br>
liquid level and thereby separate the two volumes from one another.<br>
A connection of the volumes is effected through an opening or a<br>
passage in the partition or, for example, by having the partition<br>
extend from one side wall of the container only into a region<br>
proximal to the opposite side wall so that between the end of the<br>
partition and that side wall, a gap remains for passing the liquid.<br>
Such a container which is of expensive construction and<br>
has the shape of a bottle is known from US Patent 4,856,685. With<br>
the construction disclosed in US Patent 4,856,685, it can be<br>
achieved, for example, with oil bottles for motor vehicle oil that<br>
the bottle can be rotated from its normal vertical standing<br>
position through an angle up to 90° and thus into the horizonal<br>
recumbent position without oil flowing from the supply volume into<br>
the discharge volume and from there to the pouring opening.<br>
Should one wish to fill a motor vehicle with oil in a<br>
tight engine compartment, there is always the problem of<br>
conventional oil bottles or containers, that when the bottle is<br>
very full, even a slight tilting of the bottle will result in oil<br>
spilling from the pouring opening, especially when the pouring<br>
opening of the oil bottle has not been positioned with sufficient<br>
precision over the oil filling fitting of the engine. In this case<br>
the oil can flow alongside the oil filling opening which is<br>
detrimental from an economical and ecological point of view.<br>
With the container under discussion, for example, the oil<br>
bottle described in US Patent 4,856,685, it is possible to rotate<br>
or tilt the container initially from its normal angle standing<br>
position through a limiting angle, for example to the horizontal<br>
position (limiting angle of 90°) so that the pouring opening of the<br>
oil bottle can lie from precisely above the filling fitting of the<br>
engine before oil emerges from the pouring opening of the oil<br>
bottle.<br>
Only upon a further tilting beyond the limiting angle,<br>
for example the horizontal, that is through more than 90°, will oil<br>
flow from the supply volume, especially through a connecting<br>
opening or a connecting passage, into the withdrawal volume and can<br>
then flow from there to the pouring opening.<br>
The construction of the conventional oil bottle has<br>
however the drawback that the oil flows initially into a region of<br>
the withdrawal volume which lies beneath the pouring opening and<br>
only upon complete filling of this region up to the lower edge of<br>
the pouring opening so as to emerge therefrom.<br>
A person who intends to discharge the liquid from such a<br>
container can do so only with difficulty if sensitivity is required<br>
since that individual cannot be certain when the liquid will emerge<br>
from the outlet opening because initially the liquid must pass from<br>
the supply volume into the withdrawal volume and then, when this is<br>
filled to a certain level, can emerge from the outlet opening. A<br>
fine feel with respect to pouring is however of special importance,<br>
especially when liquids of potential danger are discharged from a<br>
vessel. A container of the described construction is therefore not<br><br>
suitable for a fine feel delivery and reliable discharge of such<br>
substances.<br>
The vessels which are known and are used as oil<br>
containers have in addition the drawback that an equalization of<br>
the reduced pressure in the supply volume of the container which is<br>
produced as oil is discharged from the outlet opening and the<br>
connecting opening between the volumes/ that is with the outflowing<br>
oil, cannot be readily achieved. Since such a pressure<br>
equalization does not occur continuously but rather in an impulsive<br>
and sudden manner when the reduced pressure in the supply volume<br>
drops below a certain reduced pressure, a uniform pouring of the<br>
oil from such known oil vessel is not possible. Because of the<br>
pulse-like pressure equalizing shocks, the oil is discharged<br>
likewise in pulses from the outlet opening of the bottle and that<br>
can give rise to the flow of oil even in the case of a previously<br>
precisely positioned outlet opening above the filling fitting,<br>
alongside a fitting which again from an economical and ecological<br>
point of view is a significant drawback. Especially with liquids<br>
which are hazardous, this drawback can pose a danger to the person<br>
holding the vessel as well as to the environment.<br>
Furthermore, with the simple construction of the<br>
partition in an oil bottle according to US Patent 4,856,685, the<br>
storage volume of the oil bottle cannot be completely emptied since<br>
oil residue can accumulate on the surfaces of the partition which<br><br>
cannot be reliably delivered to the pouring opening or cannot be<br>
completely shaken from the withdrawal volume.<br>
To the extent that an oil residue will remain in the<br>
bottle, namely, the known oil bottle according to US Patent<br>
4,856,685, there can be an environmental impact in the disposal of<br>
the bottle, for example when the latter is used for oil or another<br>
liquid hazardous substance, and in addition, there is a loss in<br>
terms of the useful substance itself.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a container,<br>
especially a bottle, for the storage and pouring of liquids of the<br>
type described at the outset, which enables a reliable, uniform<br>
pouring of the liquid and a complete emptying of residues from the<br>
container.<br>
According to the invention, these objects are achieved in<br>
that the withdrawal volume opens into the pouring opening, and in<br>
that the pouring opening upon a tilting of the container between<br>
the limiting angle and the overhead position of the container is<br>
respectively at the lowest location of the withdrawal volume or the<br>
container housing region which is bounded by the withdrawal volume.<br>
The objects are alternatively also achieved in that the<br>
container has a venting passage which extends from the pouring<br>
opening and opens into the supply volume [storage volume].<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, the<br>
objects are also achieved in that in an overhead position of the<br>
container, the housing region of the container bounding the supply<br>
or storage volume, has a gradient in the direction of the<br>
connecting opening or the connecting passage between the storage<br>
volume and the withdrawal volume and/or that the withdrawal volume<br>
delimiting the housing regions of the container or the housing<br>
areas delimiting the withdrawal volume have a descending gradient<br>
in the direction of the pouring opening.<br>
In the sense of the invention, by the "normal vertical<br>
position" of the container, a position will be understood in which<br>
in which the container or the bottle is usually upright and<br>
positioned for sale. In this position, the container housing<br>
extends customarily above a container base surface which in the<br>
normal vertical position of the container is oriented horizontally.<br>
A further external configuration of the container in this<br>
vertical position is irrelevant with respect to the features which<br>
are important to the invention and, for example, the bottle can<br>
have a rectangular, round or other kind of cross section and in<br>
addition, the cross section can vary toward the pouring opening<br>
located thereabove.<br>
In the normal vertical position of the container,<br>
preferably the pouring opening is disposed at the upper end and as<br><br>
an example and preferably so that the mouth of the pouring opening<br>
is oriented parallel to the base surface of the container. In this<br>
orientation, the axis of a screw-type closure which is preferably<br>
provided, is located perpendicular to the base surface of the<br>
container. Even this arrangement is, however, not required since<br>
the orientation of the pouring opening can have other angles.<br>
In the normal vertical position,, moreover, the internal<br>
volume of the container is subdivided into a storage or supply<br>
volume and a withdrawal or discharge volume, whereby the withdrawal<br>
volume is disposed above the storage volume. Both volumes are<br>
connected together, for example, through an opening or a passage.<br>
By the "overhead" position of the container, a position<br>
is to be understood in which the pouring opening of the container<br>
is oriented downwardly and simultaneously the base surface of the<br>
container again is oriented horizontally. The overhead position<br>
thus corresponds to a rotation of the container through 180° from<br>
the normal vertical position.<br>
The limiting angular position is the position in which<br>
the container assumes upon being rotated from the normal vertical<br>
position until the liquid overflows with a further tilting from the<br>
storage volume into the withdrawal or discharge volume. With a<br>
rotation from the normal vertical position to this limiting angle,<br>
there is no liquid overflow or transfer between the volumes.<br><br>
Depending upon the construction, the limiting angles can<br>
have different values. Basically any desired angle between 0° and<br>
180° is possible whereby an angle in the range of 90° ± 30°,<br>
preferably a tilting of 90°, is selected as the limiting angular<br>
position, thus the position in which the container is horizontally<br>
oriented.<br>
Height or altitude indications are, within the scope of<br>
this description, basically to be understood as relating to the<br>
gravitational effect.<br>
In the limiting angular position beyond which an overflow<br>
from the supply volume to the withdrawal volume occurs can<br>
preferably and by way of example, correspond to a tilting through<br>
90° from the normal vertical standing position and thus into a<br>
substantially horizontal arrangement of the container in which its<br>
base surface is oriented vertically and in which the liquid passes<br>
into the withdrawal volume and because of the gravitational effect,<br>
flows to its deepest position at which the pouring opening is<br>
located so that the liquid will immediately flow out of the pouring<br>
opening without accumulating initially in another region of the<br>
withdrawal volume.<br>
Thus with the construction according to the invention,<br>
there is only one barrier which the liquid must overcome, namely,<br>
that between the storage volume and the withdrawal volume. Such a<br><br>
construction enables a highly sensitive metering discharge of<br>
liquid from the container which also enables such a container to be<br>
used for hazardous substances.<br>
As has been previously described, according to an<br>
alternative of the invention, the separation into two volumes can<br>
be effected by means of a partition which then can have, for<br>
example, a throughgoing opening or a throughgoing passage. Also<br>
the connection of the two volumes can be effective in that the<br>
partition does not extend completely to one of the inner walls of<br>
the housing of the container so that an opening remains between the<br>
two volumes. The throughgoing opening or the throughgoing passage<br>
is located, in the case of. a partition, close to a side wall of the<br>
container housing so that this opening, upon a tilting up to the<br>
limiting angle always remains above the liquid level and only upon<br>
a tilting beyond the limiting angle can it be traversed by the<br>
liquid.<br>
The withdrawal volume can, according to another<br>
alternative and preferred manner of operation, be so configured<br>
that it forms a passage whose one end opens in the pouring opening<br>
and whose other end opens in the storage volume. Preferably in<br>
this case upon a tilting of the container up to the limiting angle,<br>
the withdrawal volume or the withdrawal passage opens in an upper<br>
region, especially in the highest area of the storage volume.<br>
With a tilting of the container beyond the limiting<br>
value, this region is lowered until it passes below the liquid<br>
level so that liquid flows over from the storage volume into the<br>
withdrawal volume over the region forming the opening.<br>
With respect to the normal vertical position of the<br>
container, this construction can also be so described that a<br>
container according to the inventibn has a withdrawal passage which<br>
rises in height and whose upper end opens in a pouring opening and<br>
whose lower end lies close to or bounds a lateral container wall to<br>
open through the upper housing wall of the container in the storage<br>
volume, whereby the withdrawal passage starting from one side wall<br>
of the container extends in the direction of the opposite side<br>
wall.<br>
With this construction it can be ensured that with a<br>
tipping of the container between the limiting angle and the<br>
overhead position, the withdrawal passage will extend from the<br>
supply volume to the pouring opening in the direction in which<br>
gravity acts, and so that the pouring opening always forms the<br>
deepest location of the withdrawal passage or the withdrawal<br>
volume.<br>
In this construction, the withdrawal passage can be<br>
formed in one piece on the container housing forming the storage<br>
volume or can be connected with the latter over suitable connecting<br><br>
means, for example, by a screw connection. Such a withdrawal<br>
passage which has an S-shaped configuration between its outer mouth<br>
openings, can be retrofitted onto an existing container.<br>
It is advantageous when the mouth opening, through which<br>
the discharge passage is connected with the storage volume formed<br>
by the housing, is the highest point in the upper housing wall of<br>
the storage volume with reference to the vertical position of the<br>
container.<br>
To stabilize the withdrawal passage above the supply<br>
volume, the passage beneath the pouring opening can be connected by<br>
means of a rib with the housing of the supply volume lying<br>
thereunder. This rib is preferably part of the container housing<br>
which forms the opening region between the two volumes so that<br>
between these regions of the container, a grip is formed and so<br>
that the discharge passage is also configured as a grip for the<br>
container.<br>
If the container according to the invention is tilted<br>
from a normal vertical standing position beyond the limiting angle,<br>
for example in excess of 90°, the liquid disposed in the storage<br>
volume in construction with a partition, passes over its tip or<br>
through an opening or, in the case of an inserted discharge volume<br>
or discharge passage, through the overflow opening or the overflow<br><br>
passage into the discharge volume and from there passes to the<br>
pouring opening.<br>
In the case of only a slight tilting of the container<br>
beyond the above-mentioned limiting angle, the liquid merely wets<br>
the lower regions of the discharge volume or discharge passage and<br>
cannot completely fill the volume of the withdrawal passage lying<br>
thereabove. With this orientation of pressure, equalization can<br>
occur without problems between the storage volume and the external<br>
atmosphere.<br>
If, however, the container or the bottle is tilted to a<br>
greater extent, the outflowing liquid will completely fill the<br>
connecting opening and/or the withdrawal volume. In that case a<br>
pressure equalization through the withdrawal volume or the<br>
withdrawal passage is no longer possible.<br>
The construction of the container according to the<br>
invention which can be used also independently from the<br>
aforedescribed construction provides that the container have a<br>
venting passage which extends from the pouring opening and opens<br>
into the storage volume.<br>
Through implementing a venting passage which extends from<br>
the mouth of the pouring opening to the storage volume, the<br>
invention can achieve a continuous pressure equalization toward the<br>
pouring of the liquid. In this manner the development of an<br>
underpressure in the supply volume to a certain limiting value is<br>
precluded and also the induction of a large air volume through the<br>
container or pouring opening of the container is precluded which<br>
can give rise to an uneven discharge of the liquid. Through the<br>
venting passage, it is thus ensured that the liquid from the<br>
container will be uniformly discharged without an undesirable<br>
spurting and spraying of the liquid.<br>
So that the venting passage which begins in the pouring<br>
opening will not draw liquid into it, the mouth of this venting<br>
passage with reference to the direction in which gravity acts is<br>
located at an upper region of the pouring opening which is not<br>
wetted by the outflowing liquid upon a tilting of the container.<br>
Advantageously the venting passage is so arranged that<br>
this passage extends from the pouring opening to an opening mouth<br>
in the storage volume of the container which lies diametrically<br>
opposite the pouring opening.<br>
Upon a tilting of the container beyond the limiting<br>
angle, the mouth opening of the venting passage is located at a<br>
position of the supply volume which forms the highest point of the<br>
container and at which the inflowing air can collect. Because of<br>
this construction, the mouth opening lies above the liquid level in<br><br>
the storage volume upon a tilting of the container beyond the<br>
limiting angle.<br>
In this manner it can be ensured that the air entering<br>
through the venting passage does not have to pass at any point<br>
through the liquid which is to be poured out but rather is always<br>
delivered to an air space which increases continuously during<br>
liquid emitting at the upper end of the container so that the calm<br>
of the liquid within the container is in no way disturbed by the<br>
inflow of the air. Furthermore, this solution according to the<br>
invention with respect to the container construction renders the<br>
container suitable for liquid hazardous substances for which a<br>
reliable, uniform and controlled-quantity pouring must be ensured.<br>
An especially simple configuration of the venting passage<br>
can be achieved when the venting passage is located in or on a wall<br>
of the container housing. Thus the venting passage can, for<br>
example, be considered directly.with respect to fabrication of the<br>
container and can be made, for example, by the blow molding or even<br>
welding together of two container halves.<br>
By means of these fabrication processes, a partition can<br>
be also made in the container. For example, the partition can be<br>
so formed in the housing wall that gripping troughs can be provided<br>
therein.<br><br>
Preferably the venting passage in or on the region of the<br>
wall of the container housing is so configured that upon the<br>
described tilting of the container out of the vertical position, it<br>
extends upwardly with reference to the direction in which gravity<br>
acts. This can ensure that with a short venting passage, the<br>
liquid-emptied upper region of the storage volume can be connected<br>
with the ambient external air through the venting passage.<br>
The function of the container according to the invention<br>
has already been described and from that it can be seen that the<br>
liquid first flows from the supply volume into the withdrawal<br>
volume when the container is tilted beyond a predetermined limiting<br>
angle and thus, for example, beyond the horizontal. Basically, any<br>
possible angle can here be established at which the transfer of<br>
liquid from the supply volume into the withdrawal volume can occur,<br>
for example, by displacing the opening or transition region<br>
connecting the volumes.<br>
With a normal upright vertical stance of the container<br>
and a configuration of the venting passage within or on the<br>
container wall, whereby this venting passage has a mouth opening in<br>
the storage volume, which in the upright position of the container<br>
lies below the liquid level, based upon the number of communicating<br>
pipes, where in the venting passage the liquid level is exactly as<br>
high as it is in the storage volume.<br><br>
Upon a tilting of the container out of this upright<br>
vertical stance into the horizontal position, the concern with the<br>
construction according to the invention is that no liquid pass from<br>
the supply volume into the withdrawal volume or to the pouring<br>
opening although it is possible that liquid which may be found in<br>
the venting passage will flow through the latter as a result of the<br>
tilting and because of the gravitational action to the pouring<br>
opening, especially because the venting passage in the horizontal<br>
position of the container at least in the end position allows the<br>
effect of gravity in its path to the edge of the pouring opening.<br>
As a consequence, with a tilting of the container up to<br>
the horizontal position or up to the limiting angle, there will be<br>
indeed no liquid passing from the storage volume through the<br>
withdrawal volume up to the pouring opening, although the liquid<br>
from the venting passage can flow to the pouring opening and can<br>
drip from the end of the venting passage.<br>
To prevent this, according to a preferred further feature<br>
of the invention, it is provided that in the limiting angular<br>
position of the container, the venting passage at least in a<br>
partial segment in the pouring direction will have an increasing<br>
height so that the liquid level within the venting passage in all<br>
positions of the container from the vertical standing position up<br>
to the limiting angle will have partial segments of the venting<br>
passage which have the aforementioned increasing height counter to<br><br>
the direction in which gravity acts. In this manner it can be<br>
ensured that with a tilting of the container from the vertical<br>
normal position until it is in the position of the limiting angle<br>
and thus, for example, practically in the horizontal orientation of<br>
the container, the liquid will flow in the venting passage through<br>
the rising segment of the venting passage because of the effective<br>
forces thereon, backwards into the storage volume along the<br>
inclined plane of the venting passage. Even upon a tilting of the<br>
container to the limiting angular position, there therefore cannot<br>
be any discharge of liquid from the venting passage in the<br>
direction of the pouring opening.<br>
In order to realize this rising configuration of the<br>
venting passage, the construction preferably is such that the<br>
venting passage in its configuration has at least one passage<br>
segment which is disposed above the mouth opening upon the tilting<br>
of the bottle up to the limiting angle and through which the<br>
venting passage opens into the supply volume.<br>
In order to provide an especially steep configuration of<br>
the venting passage in at least partial region thereof at the<br>
limiting angular position, it can be provided that the venting<br>
passage between the passage segment lying above the mouth opening<br>
and the mouth opening itself has at least a further passage segment<br>
which is located beneath the mouth opening. In this manner the<br>
venting passage has between these two points a sharply bent pattern<br><br>
which serves to provide a steep inclined plane in the passage<br>
segment of the venting passage which is disposed above the mouth<br>
opening so that the liquid is prevented from reliably passing out<br>
of the venting passage to the pouring opening.<br>
To prevent an outflow of liquid reliably from the venting<br>
passage, it is according to the invention further provided that the<br>
described passage segment lying above the mouth opening to be<br>
arranged in every tilting position above the liquid level in the<br>
storage volume of the container.<br>
This can be ensured when, in a horizontal orientation of<br>
the container or at.the limiting angle and even with a vertical<br>
orientation of the container and thus the normal standing position,<br>
the passage segment which lies above the mouth opening is at least<br>
in part above the liquid level, especially above the transition<br>
opening between the volumes. The liquid level in the venting<br>
passage can then correspondingly not pass above the passage segment<br>
lying above the mouth opening in any tilting position.<br>
Upon a tilting of the container, beyond the limiting<br>
angle or preferably beyond the horizontal position, the liquid<br>
passes from the storage volume into the withdrawal volume and thus<br>
fills the connecting opening between the two volumes completely<br>
with liquid so that a pressure equalization within the supply<br>
volume from this position is only possible through the venting<br><br>
passage. Upon a discharge of liquid from the pouring opening, a<br>
corresponding reduced pressure develops in the supply volume which<br>
draws in residual fluid remaining in the venting passage back and<br>
enables the residual liquid to drip from the end of the venting<br>
passage into the supply volume.<br>
Thus the residual fluid in the venting passage remains<br>
until there is a tilting into the region of the limiting angle or<br>
the horizontal position and then by the effect of gravity and the<br>
inclined plane which is formed in the venting passage so that<br>
discharge, is prevented until there is a further tilting of the<br>
container which results in a sucking back of the residual liquid<br>
from the venting passage back into the storage volume.<br>
With the confirmation of the venting passage according to<br>
the invention, at no position of the container or in only a<br>
predetermined position of the container can there be an<br>
uncontrolled outflow of liquid from the inclined passage.<br>
With the container according to the invention, it also<br>
can be ensured that a complete emptying of the last residual liquid<br>
from the container is possible. This residual emptying can be<br>
provided in combination with, but also independently from the<br>
features which have already been described so that it is thereby<br>
ensured that in a overhead position of the container, the housing<br>
portions bounding the supply volume from below will provide a<br><br>
gradient in the direction of the connecting bounding or the<br>
connecting passage between the supply or storage volume and the<br>
withdrawal or discharge volume.<br>
In this position and with the aforementioned<br>
construction, it can be ensured that all liquid residues which may<br>
be found in the storage and supply volume will, because of the<br>
inclined planes of the wall surfaces turned toward the storage<br>
volume, be guided through the connecting opening or the connecting<br>
passage into the withdrawal volume by the effect of gravity.<br>
The residual emptying is supported by among other<br>
features, the fact that the mentioned overhead position of the<br>
container also provides a gradient from the withdrawal volume in<br>
the direction of the pouring opening. Thus it can be ensured that<br>
all liquid residues which pass from the storage volume into the<br>
withdrawal volume are also guided from the latter to the pouring<br>
opening which, as has been described, is the effect of having the<br>
mouth of the pouring opening at the deepest point of the withdrawal<br>
volume in the overhead position of the container as has previously<br>
been described.<br>
Relevant state of the art and an example of the invention<br>
are illustrated in the following drawings and will be described in<br>
greater detail hereinafter:<br><br>
The drawings show:<br>

container according to the invention and<br><br>
Fig. 9 [sic should be FIG. 14] A rear view of the<br>
container according to the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a container 1 of the type of which this<br>
application is concerned and known from the state of the art in the<br>
form of a bottle 1 for use, for example, for motor oil. The bottle<br>
1 is subdivided by a partition 2 into a storage volume or supply<br>
volume 3 and a withdrawal volume discharge volume 4. In the normal<br>
standing position shone, in which the lower housing bottom 5 is<br>
oriented horizontally, the bottle 1 is filled with a liquid, or<br><br>
example, oil. The liquid level extends here practically up to just<br>
below the partition 2.<br>
Upon tilting as shown in FIG. 2 in the direction of the<br>
arrow P through 90°, the partition 2 is substantially vertical and<br>
restricts the liquid from the storage volume 3 to an overflow into<br>
the withdrawal volume 4 since the liquid level 6 positioned upon<br>
the predetermined quantity in the container, is still below the<br>
upper edge or end 7 of the partition 2. Up to this limiting angle<br>
of 9Q°, the internal construction of the bottle is such that it<br>
prevents liquid from flowing from the outlet opening or pouring<br>
opening 8 so that the pouring opening can be first positioned with<br>
accuracy, for example above a filling fitting 9.<br>
Only upon a further tilting beyond the limiting angle of<br>
90° as FIG. 3 shows, will the liquid level 6 lie above the upper<br>
edge 7 of the partition 2 so that the liquid can flow into the<br>
withdrawal volume 4. In accordance with the here illustrated<br>
construction, the liquid, however, initially collects in a lower<br>
region 4a of the withdrawal volume 4 and only can flow from the<br>
pouring opening 8 out of the bottle when the level in the<br>
withdrawal region 4a reaches the height of the lower edge of the<br>
pouring opening 8.<br>
Thus here the bottle 1 illustrated here in FIGS. 1-5 has<br>
substantially two barriers which must be overcome by the liquid<br><br>
before it emerges from the pouring opening 8. As a consequence<br>
there is as a first barrier, the upper edge 7 of the partition 2<br>
and as a second barrier, the lower edge of the pouring opening 8.<br>
Through these two barriers which must be overcome in succession,<br>
there is no possibility for a person to have highly sensitive<br>
control of the liquid quantity which is discharged and thus the<br>
possibility of a highly accurate dosing of the liquid quantity so<br>
that the evaluated bottle 2 is not appropriate for fine pouring and<br>
the supply of hazardous substances.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a further tilting of the bottle 1 in which<br>
the withdrawal volume 4 and the throughgoing opening 10 above the<br>
edge 7 of the partition 2, which connects the withdrawal volume 4<br>
with the supply volume 3, is completely filled with liquid. As the<br>
liquid flows from the outlet opening 8 from the bottle 1, an<br>
underpressure develops in the region of the storage volume 3 which<br>
must be equalized to allow additional liquid to be discharged from<br>
the bottle. In the illustrated case, a pressure equalization is<br>
effected in that air is drawn into the pouring opening 8 which<br>
passes in the form of more or less large bubbles 11 through the<br>
withdrawal volume 4, the throughgoing opening 10 and the liquid in<br>
the storage volume 3 to the upper region 12 of the bottle. Since<br>
the pressure equalization as a rule is of an impulsive nature,<br>
correspondingly large pressure variations can develop within the<br>
bottle 1 which can give rise to an irregular outflow of the liquid<br>
from the pouring opening and thus also the possible spraying or<br><br>
scattering of the liquid. On this ground as well, the illustrated<br>
known bottle 1 is not suitable for discharge selectively in a<br>
controlled flow of hazardous liquids.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a situation in which the bottle 1 is<br>
illustrated in the overhead position. This position which<br>
corresponds to a tilting angle of 180°, also indicates the<br>
aforementioned drawbacks of the impulsive pressure equalization and<br>
makes clear that the bottle 1 cannot be completely emptied in this<br>
position since, on the upper surface partition 2, especially in the<br>
case of high viscosity, thick liquid residues can remain which<br>
cannot find their way through the connecting opening into the<br>
withdrawal volume 4. Thus a disposal of such a bottle 1 with<br>
residues is highly undesirable from the point of view of<br>
environmental protection and furthermore, the residue is lost as a<br>
valuable substance.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the container according to the invention in<br>
the form of a bottle 1 for the storage and pouring of liquids with<br>
an internal volume and a pouring opening 8, wherein the internal<br>
volume is subdivided into a storage volume 3 and a withdrawal<br>
volume 4 which are connected with one another through the<br>
connecting opening 10 so that in a normal vertical standing<br>
position of the container according to FIG. 6, the withdrawal<br>
volume 4 is located above the storage volume 3 and an overflow of<br>
liquid from the storage volume 3 into the withdrawal volume 4 is<br><br>
prevented until the bottle 1 is tilted beyond the predetermined<br>
limiting angle according to FIG. 8 from the vertical position.<br>
In the showing of FIG. 6 and following illustrations, it<br>
is clear that the withdrawal volume 4 so opens at the pouring<br>
opening 8 that the pouring opening upon a tilting of the container,<br>
as has been shown in FIG. 8-11, between the limiting angle (FIG. 8)<br>
and the overhead position (FIG. 11) of the bottle 1, always forms<br>
the lowest point of the withdrawal volume 4.<br>
This is especially clear in FIG. 8, where the bottle 1 is<br>
shown in he limiting angle position, that is having rotated through<br>
90° in the counterclockwise sense whereby according to the present<br>
configuration of the withdrawal volume 4 has a passage, one end 4.1<br>
opens in the pouring opening 8 and the other end 4.2 opens through<br>
the connecting opening 10 into the storage volume 3. In this<br>
position, as is illustrated in FIG. 8, the pouring opening 8<br>
assumes the lowest point of the withdrawal volume 4 which is always<br>
the case for the further rotated or tilted position of FIGS. 9, 10<br>
and 11 through the overhead position is reached.<br>
At all angles beyond the limiting angle up to the<br>
attainment of the overhead position, the pouring opening 8 is<br>
always at the lowest position of the withdrawal volume 4 which<br>
prevents the formation in the withdrawal volume 4 of regions in<br>
which the liquid must initially collect before it is discharged<br><br>
from the pouring opening 8 and which has been found to be a<br>
drawback in the state of the art. Such a bottle construction<br>
enables a fine feel for the metering of the discharge of the<br>
liquid.<br>
From FIG. 7 it will be apparent that the pouring opening<br>
forms the lowest point of the withdrawal volume 4 upon tilting even<br>
at angles less than the limiting angle and as seen as the pouring<br>
opening 8 upon rotation is located below the transfer opening 10<br>
between the two volumes 3/4. This is a consequence of how the<br>
passage forming the withdrawal volume runs from its beginning in<br>
the transfer region 10 to its end in the pouring opening 8.<br>
The bottle 1 according to the invention utilizes the<br>
important features of the invention when it is filled with a<br>
quantity of liquid so that the liquid level 6 in the upright<br>
vertical positioning of the bottle according to FIG. 6 in which the<br>
transfer opening 10 between the volume or the tip 7 are horizontal.<br>
This maximum quantity to which the bottle can be filled has the<br>
prerequisite for an unobjectionable utilization of the features of<br>
the invention.<br>
If then the bottle 1 is tilted to the limiting angle<br>
according to FIG. 7 in the counterclockwise sense represented by<br>
the direction of the arrow P, the liquid level 6 will remain below<br>
the transfer opening 10 or the tip 7 between the two volumes 3/4<br><br>
until the limiting angle, in this case 90°, is reached according to<br>
FIG. 8. Upon a further rotation beyond the limiting angle so that<br>
the bottle assumes the position shown in FIG. 9, the liquid passes<br>
above the opening 10 or the tip 7 into the withdrawal volume 4<br>
which is configured as a passage and from there by gravity flows to<br>
the outlet or pouring opening 8 located at the deepest point so<br>
that it can emerge from the bottle.<br>
The bottle according to the invention has the advantage<br>
that upon tilting up to the limiting angle, in the present case<br>
90°, no liquid will flow out of the pouring opening so that the<br>
pouring opening 8 can, for example, be accurately positioned above<br>
a filling fitting (not shown).<br>
In the present case of the illustrated bottle 1, the<br>
withdrawal passage 4 is formed as a tubular segment on the<br>
uppermost housing portion of the storage volume 4 [sic] of the<br>
bottle 1 in one piece and in the region of the transfer 10 is so<br>
configured that this passage-shaped tubular segment extends above<br>
the housing region 10 which borders the storage volume 3 from<br>
above. Corresponding to the illustration, the passage-shaped<br>
withdrawal volume 4 can be configured as a grip enabling the bottle<br>
according to the invention to be securely carried. For stabilizing<br>
the grip element which is formed by the withdrawal passage 4, a rib<br>
14 is provided which connects a region below the pouring opening<br>
with the region lying therebeneath of the upper housing region 13<br><br>
of the storage volume 4 [sic] so that between this rib and the one-<br>
piece transition, the connection 10 is formed between the volumes<br>
3/4 and defines the grip 15 for receiving fingers of a hand.<br>
The here illustrated construction can also be such that<br>
the upper housing wall 13 of the storage volume 3 and the lower<br>
limiting housing wall of the withdrawal passage 4 form the two side<br>
surfaces of a partition 2 by means of which the interior volume of<br>
the bottle 1 according to the invention is subdivided into the<br>
storage volume 3 and the withdrawal volume 4 connecting the regions<br>
formed by these housing regions 13/16 corresponding to the tip 7 of<br>
this partition between opposite sides of which the liquid passes<br>
between the volumes 3/4 in the transfer region 10.<br>
By contrast with the state of the art, the bottle 1<br>
according to the invention has the advantage that, upon the<br>
discharge of liquid there is a sufficient ventilation of the<br>
storage volume 3. This is achieved by a venting passage 17 which<br>
extends from the pouring opening 8 and opens into the storage<br>
volume 3. As a consequence with the present embodiment, the mouth<br>
opening 18 of the ventilation passage 17 in the storage volume 3<br>
lies diametrically opposite the pouring opening 8 so that upon a<br>
tilting of the bottle 1 according to FIGS. 9, 10 and 11, the mouth<br>
opening 18 of the venting passage 17 is so arranged in the storage<br>
volume 3 that it always lies t the highest point. As a result the<br>
system according to the invention ensures that the air which is<br><br>
drawn in at the pouring opening 8 without coming into contact with<br>
the liquid can enter the upper ventilated region 12 of the storage<br>
volume without agitating the liquid or creating turbulence therein.<br>
Through this construction, the venting passage 17 ensures a uniform<br>
and passive liquid discharge.<br>
Especially FIGS. 12 and 13 show that the mouth 19 of the<br>
venting passage 17 is located in the pouring opening 8 at an upper<br>
region thereof in the tilted position so that this mouth opening<br>
19/ through which air is sucked into the bottle, is not wetted by<br>
the outflowing liquid. This can prevent the underpressure in the<br>
storage volume 3 from sucking liquid back into the venting passage<br>
and stopping it up. Furthermore, it can be deduced from FIGS. 12<br>
and 13 that the venting passage 17 is arranged on the upper surface<br>
of the bottle 1 and above the withdrawal passage 4 configured as a<br>
grip and with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, above the right side<br>
surface 20 of the bottle to extend to a point where the venting<br>
passage, as FIG. 6 and 14 show, to open the lowest point 18 in the<br>
storage volume 3 in an upright position of the bottle. Alterna-<br>
tively there is a possibility in another construction of the<br>
venting passage to be arranged directly within the housing wall of<br>
the container 1.<br>
To prevent the liquid from flowing in an uncontrolled<br>
manner to the pouring opening 8 where the venting passage 17 is<br>
provided and the liquid is at the level 6 shown in FIG. 6, the<br><br>
bottle 1 according to the invention has a special construction<br>
which can be seen in its important aspect from FIG. 8. FIG. 8<br>
shows the limiting angular position of the container 1, that is a<br>
tilting through 90° from the vertical position and from which it<br>
can be seen that the venting passage 17 has at least in a partial<br>
segment 17a, a pair in the pouring direction A and thus to the<br>
left, which is of increasing height. FIG. 8 also shows the<br>
advantageous configuration of the venting passage 17 between the<br>
mouth opening 18 and the aforementioned partial segment 17a which<br>
has a further passage segment 17b which lies below the<br>
aforedescribed mouth opening 18. As a result, there is a sharp<br>
bend between the initial descending portion from the mouth opening<br>
and then into segment 17 a sharp rise in the path of the venting<br>
passage which ensures that in the illustrated limiting angular<br>
position, the residual liquid in the venting passage will collect<br>
at the bend 21, especially ahead of the sharply rising segment 17a<br>
of the venting passage and because of the effect of gravity, will<br>
be prevented from the passing to the descending region 17c of the<br>
venting passage 17 o.n the left side of the segment 17a.<br>
If the bottle 1 of the invention is tilted further beyond<br>
the limiting angle as is seen in FIG. 9, the liquid passes over the<br>
connecting opening 10 into the withdrawal volume 4 and thus both<br>
the withdrawal volume 4 and the throughgoing opening 10 will<br>
completely close so that through the under-pressure produced by the<br>
liquid discharge in the storage volume 3, a pressure equalization<br>
can only occur through the venting passage 17.<br>
Correspondingly air 22 is sucked in through the venting<br>
passage 17 and drives back the residual liquid quantity 2 collected<br>
in the bend 22 in the direction of the mouth opening 18 so that<br>
this residual liquid 24 as shown in FIG. 9 will pass back as<br>
droplets 23 into the storage volume 3 even before the segment 17a<br>
which rises in the limiting angular position reaches a horizontal<br>
orientation on further tilting according to FIG. 9 which enables a<br>
passage of the liquid into the descending venting passage region<br>
17c.<br>
Through the described construction it can be effectively<br>
ensured that an uncontrolled liquid discharge from the venting<br>
passage 17 is also prevented upon a tilting of the bottle 1<br>
according to the invention.<br>
To configure a venting passage 17 for the effect required<br>
by the invention, it is not necessary to subdivide the vent passage<br>
into the rising and falling passage segments 17a and 17b. It is<br>
basically sufficient that in the limiting angular position of the<br>
container, the venting passge 17 starting from the mouth opening 18<br>
in the storage volume have a rising pattern especially with respect<br>
to the liquid level 6 in the storage volume 4 [sic] . A<br>
sufficiently precise and satisfactory positioning of the rising<br><br>
segment 17a of the vent passage 17 is then achieved when the<br>
segment 17a of the venting passage lying above the mouth opening 18<br>
in the limiting angular position (FIG. 8) , in the vertical normal<br>
orientation (FIG. 6) of the bottle 1 and all the positions<br>
intervening therebetween at least segmentally is arranged above the<br>
connecting opening 10 between the volume 3/4. In this case in the<br>
mentioned positions the residual liquid quantiy 24 in the vent<br>
passage 17 always flows against the rising venting passage segment<br>
17a which presents a further flow toward the pouring opening 8.<br>
FIG. 11 makes clear that in the overhead position of the<br>
bottle according to the invention, complete emptying of residue is<br>
also possible without the need for the person who desires to empty<br>
the bottle to think about the exact positioning. FIG. 11 here<br>
shows that in the overhead position, the housing region 13 bounding<br>
the storage volume 3 of the bottle 1 from below has a gradient in<br>
the direction of the connecting opening 10 between the storage<br>
volume and the withdrawal volume 4. If then the bottle according<br>
to the invention is only approximately vertical in its overhead<br>
orientation, this gradient will ensure that all liquid of the<br>
storage volume 3 will be reliably guided to the connecting opening<br>
10 by gravity and from there will flow into the withdrawal volume 4<br>
or the discharge passage 4.<br>
Since the withdrawal volume 4 or the discharge passage 4<br>
is also the housing region 25 which forms the lower boundary of the<br><br>
housing, a gradient in the direction of the pouring opening 8 is<br>
provided and ensures that the liquid quantities which have been<br>
found their way to the withdrawal volume 4 will also reliably pass<br>
to the pouring opening 8 which forms the lowest point of the<br>
withdrawal volume 4. Thus a reliable emptying of residues is<br>
ensured. Alternatively to the illustrated configuration in the<br>
embodiment shown, a construction is posible in which a partition<br>
within the container volume ensures a complete emptying of residues<br>
to the extent that the partition 2 has a tip 7 which at the opening<br>
and the partition has a tapering path to the opening which is so<br>
formed that the wall side 13 of the partition which is turned<br>
toward the storage volume provides in the overhead position a<br>
gradient in the direction of the opening 10.<br>
The previously described bottle based upon its structual<br>
features is especially suitable for the uniform metered discharge<br>
of liquid from the bottle as well as a complete arranging of all<br>
residues even with liquid hazardous material.<br>
