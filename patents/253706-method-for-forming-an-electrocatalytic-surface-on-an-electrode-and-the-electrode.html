				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of forming an electrocatalytic surface on<br>
an electrode in a. simple way, in particular on a lead anode used in the<br>
electrolytic recover of metals. The catalytic coating is formed by a spraying<br>
method which does not essentially alter the characteristics of the coating<br>
powder during spraying, Transition metal oxides are used as the coating<br>
material. After spray coating, the electrode is ready for use without further<br>
treatment. The Invention also relates to an electrode onto which an<br>
eiectrocatalytic surface is formed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The electrolytic recovery of metals, especially metals that are more noble<br>
than hydrogen, takes place from an aqueous solution of the metal. The<br>
recovery of zinc from an aqueous solution can also be performed electrolytically, although zinc is a less noble metal than hydrogen, it is typical<br>
of the method that a pure metal is reduced from the solution onto the<br>
cathode and a gas forms on the anode, which depending on the conditions is<br>
chlorine, oxygen or carbon dioxide, insoluble anodes are used as the anode.<br>
in this case electrolysis is called electrowinning, The most common metals<br>
that are produced by electrowinning from an aqueous solution containing<br>
sulphuric acid are copper and zinc. The potential in the copper and zinc<br>
electrolysis process is regulated to a range in which oxygen is formed at the<br>
anode.<br>
Producing a purs metal in electrolysis is the sum total of many factors, but<br>
one important factor is the quality of the anode. The anodes used in copper<br>
and zinc electro-winning are usually made of isad or lead alloy, where the<br>
alloy contains 0.3 - 1.0% silver and possibly 0.04-0.07% calcium. When the<br>
lead based anode described above is used for example in zinc electrolysis,<br><br>
in which the H2SO4 concentration is of the order of 150-200 g/l, the lead of<br>
the anode starts to dissolve and precipitate on the cathode. The precipitation<br>
of lead on the cathode also causes short circuits, which impede electrolysis.<br>
Under electrolysis conditions, a layer of lead oxide is formed naturally on the<br>
surface of the lead anode, which partially protects the anode from corrosion.<br>
In addition, zinc electrolyte usually contains 3-6 g/l manganese, which over<br>
time precipitates a layer of MnO2 on the anode surface. However, when<br>
there is a thick layer of MnO2 on the surface of the anode, the anode starts to<br>
behave as if it was an MnO2 electrode. The drawbacks of a naturally forming<br>
layer of MnO2 are that a thick layer may cause short circuits and part may fall<br>
into the electrolyte, if its adhesiveness is poor in places. A solid MnO2 layer<br>
is believed to have its own effect on the corrosion of lead anodes and so the<br>
precipitation of manganese ions from the electrolyte solution is considered<br>
undesirable. A major disadvantage is also that a thick MnO2 layer requires a<br>
high anode potential to form oxygen and this raises the energy costs of the<br>
process.<br>
Attempts have been made to prevent anodes from corroding in many ways.<br>
One way to solve the problem is to form a catalyst layer on the surface of the<br>
anode before submersing the anode in the electrolyte, so that the layer<br>
protects the anode from corrosion. However, finding a suitable catalyst<br>
causes difficulties, because electrolysis operates at fairly high acid<br>
concentrations.<br>
Particularly in chlorine-alkali electrolysis, anodes known as dimensionally<br>
stable anodes (DSA), which are described for example in US patents<br>
3,632,498 and 4,140,813, have been used for decades. These have also<br>
been proposed for use instead of lead electrodes in the electrolysis of zinc<br>
and copper because of their energy-saving characteristics, but traditional<br>
anodes made of lead alloy are nevertheless still in use in the majority of the<br>
world's copper and zinc electrolysis facilities.<br><br>
Methods are known in which an electrocatalyst is formed on the surface of<br>
DSA electrodes. The electrode material, which is usually titanium, is<br>
pretreated by etching or sandblasting and can be given further after-<br>
treatment by spraying some kind of valve metal such as titanium or its oxide.<br>
The final catalytic coating is formed from a solution or suspension of the<br>
catalyst or its precursor, such as a metal salt or organometallic compound.<br>
These chemicals are generally decomposed thermally i.e. treated in a<br>
furnace at a raised temperature to form the desired, catalytically active<br>
surface. The catalyst material is a metal or oxide of the platinum group or<br>
alternatively one of the following metals: titanium, tantalum, niobium,<br>
aluminium, zirconium, manganese, nickel or an alloy thereof. The catalyst<br>
layer can be produced on the surface in different ways, such as painting on<br>
or by spraying, but the layer formation requires one or several heat<br>
treatments at a temperature between 450 - 600Â°C. Often further<br>
intermediate layers are formed on the electrode surface before the formation<br>
of the final protective layer.These kinds of methods are described in e.g EP<br>
patents 407349 and 576402 and US patent 6287631.<br>
A method is described in US patent 4,140,813, in which a titanium oxide<br>
layer is formed on a sandblasted titanium anode by plasma or flame<br>
spraying, where the composition of the layer can be affected by means of the<br>
spraying temperature and composition of the gas used. In plasma and flame<br>
spraying the coating material melts during spraying. The oxide layer that is<br>
formed i.e. the electrically conductive substrate layer is further treated with<br>
an electrochemically active substance. As activation substances, platinum<br>
metals are employed, preferably ruthenium or iridium, as elements or as<br>
compounds and they are brushed on top of the oxide layer.<br>
Coatings have also been developed for the surface of a lead anode to<br>
protect it and facilitate the development of oxygen. An anode is described in<br>
US patent 4425217, Diamond Shamrock Corp., in which the base of lead or<br><br>
lead compound is provided with catalytic particles of titanium, which contain<br>
a very small amount of platinum group metal or an oxide thereof. In the<br>
coating fabrication method both the anode and the titanium powder are<br>
treated by etching and the powder is heat-treated in order to oxidize the<br>
precious metal salts into oxides. The powder is attached to the anode<br>
surface by pressing.<br>
EP patent 87186, Eltech Systems Corp., presents a means of providing a<br>
catalyst used on the surface of a DSA electrode on the surface of a lead<br>
anode, in which the catalyst is formed from a titanium sponge, which is<br>
equipped with ruthenium-manganese oxide particles. The making of the<br>
catalytic coating mentioned above in the environment of a zinc and copper<br>
electrolysis facility seems quite difficult and the coating becomes fairly costly.<br>
Attaching the powder to the surface of the anode also occurs by pressing.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to form a catalytic surface on an<br>
electrode, particularly a lead based anode, used in the electrolytic recovery<br>
of metals. The surface formed protects the anode from corroding and as an<br>
effect of the surface the overpotential of oxygen required at the anode<br>
remains low. Methods described in the prior art for forming a catalytic surface<br>
require heat treatment and/or etching and possible intermediate layers, but<br>
the method now developed is considerably simpler, because the pre-<br>
treatment of the anode is straightforward, after which catalyst powder is<br>
sprayed directly onto the anode surface and after this the anode is ready for<br>
use without any additional further treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for forming an electrocatalytic surface on<br>
an electrode and the electrode formed in this way. According to the method<br>
the surface of the electrode is sprayed with at least one of the oxides of the<br><br>
transition metals in powder form as a catalytic coating, after which the<br>
electrode is ready for use without any separate heat treatments.<br>
The electrode is preferably a lead anode used in the electrolytic recovery of<br>
metals. The spraying of the catalyst occurs preferably with HVOF spraying or<br>
extremely profitably with cold spraying, in which case the physical and<br>
chemical properties of the catalyst powder essentially remain unchanged<br>
during spraying, because the temperature change occurring in spraying is<br>
minor.<br>
The catalyst is preferably selected to be a transition metal oxide, typically<br>
although not compulsorily the form MO2 MO3, M3O4 or M2O5, where M is a<br>
transition metal.<br>
The catalyst material is preferably one or more of the group: MnO2, PtO2,<br>
RUO2, IrO2, Co3O4, NiCo2O4, CoFe2O4, PbO2, NiO2, TiO2, perovskites,<br>
SnO2,-Ta2O5j WO3 and MoO3.<br>
The oxides used as catalyst may be simple oxides or synthesized oxides. In<br>
a synthesized oxide at least one other oxide of the same metal is attached to<br>
the first metal oxide, or one or more oxides of another metal are attached to<br>
the oxide of the first metal.<br>
The invention also relates to an electrode, particularly a lead anode, on the<br>
surface of which an electrocatalytic coating is formed by spraying at least<br>
one transition metal oxide onto it. The electrode is ready for use after<br>
spraying without heat treatment.<br>
The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached<br>
claims.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential characteristics of the catalytic coating formed on the surface of<br>
the electrode are that it decreases the oxygen overpotential and protects<br>
said electrode from corrosion. The catalyst has to be low in price and the<br>
formation of the catalytic layer on the surface of the electrode will also be<br>
profitable. In addition the catalyst should adhere well to its base.<br>
In the description of the prior art it was mentioned that for example in zinc<br>
electrolysis the electrolyte contains manganese, which over time precipitates<br>
as manganese dioxide on the surface of the anode, even though this is<br>
undesirable. The purpose of the method according to the invention now<br>
developed is to form an electrocatalytic layer on the surface of a pure anode<br>
that possesses and increases the desired properties, of which one intention<br>
is to decrease the uncontrolled precipitation of manganese dioxide on the<br>
anode.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, manganese dioxide is used as the<br>
electrocatalyst. With different manufacturing methods it is possible to obtain<br>
manganese dioxides with various electrochemical properties. These include<br>
for instance beta-manganese dioxide Î²MnO2), chemically manufactured<br>
manganese dioxide (CMD) and electrochemically manufactured manganese<br>
dioxide (EMD). Other manganese dioxides that are available commercially<br>
are heat-treated (HTMD) and natural manganese dioxide (NMD), which may<br>
also be used.<br>
A catalyst coating can be formed on the surface of the anode, which is an<br>
mixture of several manganese dioxides manufactured in different ways.<br>
Likewise a coating may also be composed of some of the manganese<br>
dioxide powders mentioned above, to which some other transition metal<br>
oxides have been combined or the coating material is the oxide of some<br>
completely different transition metal or metals than manganese oxides.<br><br>
It is typical of the method according to the invention that the desired<br>
composition and characteristics of the transition metal oxide or combination<br>
of several oxides are specified before the powder is sprayed on the surface<br>
of the electrode. The spraying of the powder occurs preferably in a way that<br>
does not essentially change the properties of the powder during spraying. If<br>
desired, the oxidation degree of the powder can also be modified a little<br>
during spraying. After spraying the electrode is ready for use without further<br>
treatment.<br>
When the catalyst powder is sprayed on top of the substrate material, the<br>
powder not only forms a layer on its substrate but the catalyst particles are<br>
submerged either totally or partially into the substrate material, thus forming<br>
a strong mechanical and/or metallurgical bond. This also achieves a good<br>
electrical connection between the catalyst and substrate material.<br>
One suitable spraying method is HVOF spraying. High Velocity Oxy-Fuel<br>
spraying is based on the continuous combustion of the combustion gas or<br>
fluid and oxygen in the combustion chamber of the spray gun at high<br>
pressure and in the high-speed gas flow generated by the spray gun. The<br>
coating material is fed in powder form by means of a carrier gas, most<br>
commonly axially, into the nozzle of the gun. The powder particles heat up in<br>
the nozzle for only a very short time before they attach themselves to the<br>
substrate material. It was found in the tests carried out that even after the<br>
spraying of several catalyst layers the temperature of the substrate was only<br>
around 100 Â°C.<br>
A particularly suitable spraying method is known as the cold spraying<br>
method, based on kinetic energy. Since there is no flame in the cold spraying<br>
method, the coating and substrate material do not undergo much heating<br>
and therefore the structure of the coating remains the same during spraying.<br>
Cold spraying is based on the supersonic speed of the carrier gas achieved<br><br>
in a Laval-type nozzle. The forming of a coating is based on the deformation<br>
of the material and the cold weldability of the metals. This method is used to<br>
attain a dense and adhesive coating, as the kinetic energy of the powder<br>
particles is changed into mechanical energy and partially also into heat, as a<br>
result of which the particles are immersed into the surface to be coated and<br>
form a close-fitting mechanical and/or metallurgical join with the substrate.<br>
Measurements were made after the spraying tests that proved that the<br>
structure of the coating attached to the substrate material in coating by both<br>
the HVOF and the cold spraying techniques was absolutely the same as<br>
before spraying. The preservation of the coating structure during spraying is<br>
important because in this way the desired composition of the coating material<br>
can be controlled and at the same time the entire coating treatment can be<br>
done with one spraying, without intermediate or further treatments. Of course<br>
spraying can occur as a single sweep of the spraying gun or in several<br>
sweeps and the number of sweeps depends on the desired coating<br>
thickness, however the coating is essentially completed in one stage.<br>
Before spraying, the substrate material is cleaned either chemically and/or<br>
mechanically so that there are no extraneous foreign organic or inorganic<br>
elements on the surface in relation to the operating conditions. During<br>
cleaning, the oxide layers on the surface of the substrate that are harmful to<br>
the adherence of the coating are also removed. Typical pre-treatment is grit<br>
blasting with whatever blasting medium is thought appropriate. In some<br>
cases simple pressure washing with water is enough.<br>
The coating powder with catalytic properties is chosen to correspond in<br>
particle size to normal powder used in thermal and cold spraying, or<br>
otherwise so that it suits the desired spraying method. The powder is fed<br>
through either a powder feeder or other suitable device into the spraying<br>
nozzle or gun. The powder feeder may be an ordinary one or one specially<br>
developed for the purpose.<br><br>
In the spraying, the substrate material is coated with powder having catalytic<br>
properties to the desired layer thickness. The layer thickness is controlled by<br>
the spraying parameters, e.g. the amount of powder fed into the spray gun,<br>
the velocity speed of the spray gun in relation to the plece to be coated, the<br>
number of coatings i.e. the number of sweeps or by a combination of these.<br>
During coating one must watch that the temperature of the coating does not<br>
rise unnecessarily. Preferably coating is performed in an air atmosphere.<br>
The particle size of the catalyst powder to be used in coating is preferably in<br>
the range of 5-100 Âµm and the thickness of the coating layer around 1-5<br>
times the diameter of the coating particle. Especially when the substrate<br>
material to be coated is a lead anode, it has been found that the coating<br>
layer does not need to cover it completely. The coating fulfils its purpose in<br>
that case even though the coating particles in the anode surface are<br>
separate patches or particles.<br>
Cold spraying is a particularly beneficial spraying method when you wish to<br>
keep the coating material in exactly the composition in which it is fed into the<br>
spraying apparatus. In cold spraying there is for instance no oxidation during<br>
the actual spraying, unless it is expressly desired.<br>
If however, you wish to modify the oxidation degree of the coating material<br>
during spraying, that is also possible when the spraying method and<br>
conditions are selected corresponding to need. For example the composition<br>
of the combustion gas (propane) used in HVOF spraying or the carrier gas<br>
(air, nitrogen, helium) used in cold spraying can be used to affect the<br>
characteristics of the coating to be generated.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The commercially available manganese dioxides Î²MnO2, CMD and EMD<br>
were used in the tests carried out. Each powder was sprayed onto of a lead<br><br>
substrate alloyed with silver, with the dimensions of 150 x 270 x 8 mm. Brass<br>
hangers were attached to the upper edge of the pleces and the anodes<br>
formed in this way were tested together with standard anodes (Pb~0.6%Ag)<br>
under typical zinc electrolysis conditions. The current density in the<br>
electrolysis was 570 Am"2 and the concentrations as follows: Zn2+ 55 g/i,<br>
H2SO4 160 g/l, Mn2+ about 5 g/l. Aluminium cathodes were used in the<br>
electrolysis.<br>
The anodes were taken from the tank for inspection after 72 hours. The<br>
inspection was made both visually and by EDX-SEM measurements. The<br>
anodes, which had been sprayed with a manganese dioxide layer, had fairly<br>
little attached manganese dioxide deposited from the solution, whereas the<br>
uncoated standard electrodes clearly had more. The EMD-coated anode i.e.<br>
with electrochemically manufactured manganese dioxide, was completely<br>
free of manganese dioxide originating from the solution. On the basis of<br>
empirical observations we can conclude that the amount of MnO2 in the<br>
whole system formed on the surface of electrocatalytically coated anodes<br>
was about half the amount of MnO2 on the uncoated anodes.<br><br>
