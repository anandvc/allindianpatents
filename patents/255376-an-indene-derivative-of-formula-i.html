				<td>INDENE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel indene derivative, which is useful as a modulator of a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), a process for the preparation thereof and a pharmaceutical composition containing same as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and function as transcription factors regulating gene expression in a form of heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The PPARs are divided into three subtypes, "PPARa", "PPARy" and "PPAR8", and are generally involved in maintaining energy homeostasis in vertebrates through the control of fat and glucose metabolisms.<br>
Accordingly, many attempts have been made to develop PPARa and PPARy full agonists which are useful for the treatment and prevention of disorders modulated by PPARs, e.g., metabolic syndromes such as diabetes, obesity, arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinism and hypertension; inflammatory diseases such as osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis and asthma; and cancer.<br>
For example, it has been reported that thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TZD) and non-TZD-based full agonists on PPARy exhibit excellent blood glucose level- lowering effect in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) mammal models (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3785.; Bioorg. Med Chem. Lett., 2000, 2453.; Chem. Pharm. Bull, 2002, 50, 1349.; Bio, Med. Chem. Lett.. 2002, 77.;./. Med. Chem., 2003, 46, 3581.).<br>
However, such a PPARy full agonist is also known to cause adverse side effects including weight gain due to facilitation of fat cell differentiation, cardiac hypertrophy, edema and liver damage.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need to develop selective PPAR modulators (SPPARMs) which are capable of selectively controlling activities of the PPARs without causing side effects (Molecular Cell, 2001, 8, 737; Molecular Endocrinology, 2003, 17, 662; Molecular Endocrinology, 2002, 16, 2628).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel compound, which is capable of selectively modulating the activities of peroxisome proliferator v activated receptors (PPARs), causing no adverse side effects.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of said compound.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound as an active ingredient.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel indene derivative of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:<br>

The inventive indene derivative of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof is capable of selectively modulating activities of PPARs, and thus it causes no adverse side effects such as weight gain, cardiac hypertrophy, edema and liver damage.<br>
The present invention also includes within its scope a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the novel compounds of formula (1), as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The inventive pharmaceutical composition is useful for the treatment and prevention of disorders modulated by PPARs, i.e., metabolic syndromes such as diabetes, obesity, arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinism and hypertension; inflammatory deseases such as osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis and asthma; and cancer.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated for administration orally or parenteraliy, including intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, rectal and topical routes of administration. The composition for oral administration may take various forms such as tablets, soft and hard gelatin capsules, aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, granules and elixirs, which may contain conventional additives such as a diluent (e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and glycine), a lubricant {e.g., silica, talc, stearic acid or its magnesium and calcium salts and polyethylene glycol). In the case of the tablet form, the composition may further comprise a binder (e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and polyvinyl pyrrolidone) and optionally a disintegrant (e.g., starch, agar and alginic acid or its sodium salt), absorbent, colorant, flavor, sweetener and the like.<br><br>
The composition may be sterilized and/or contain an adjuvant such as a preservative, stabilizer, wetting agent, emulsifier, a salt for controlling an osmotic pressure and/or a buffer<br>
V<br>
solution, and other pharmaceutically effective materials.<br>
The inventive compounds may be administered as an active ingredient in an effective amount ranging from about 0.1 to 500 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.5 to 100 mg/kg per day in a single dose or in divided doses.<br>
The following Preparations and Examples are given for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

The resulting solution was intraperitoneally administered to the mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg, once a day for 5 days, or orally administered to the mice, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, twice a day for 14 days. Days 1, 3 and 5 were selected for intraperitoneal administration, and days 5, 10 and 14, for oral administration, to collect blood samples for measuring the blood<br><br>
glucose levels. The extent of inhibition of the inventive compound relative to the control (saline-0.2% Tween 80 in the absence of the compound) is shown in Table 6. Upon the completion of the oral administration for 14 days, the mice were fasted for 16hrs to perform OGTT(Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) to determine the changes in insulin sensitivity induced by the oral administration. After administrating glucose to the mice at a dose of 2g/kg orally, blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30 60 and 120 minutes to measure blood glucose levels. The change in the total amount of blood glucose was computed over the 120 minute period to assess the extent of enhancing glucose clearance rates by the compound treatment. The results are shown in table 6, as % inhibition of total amount of blood glucose by the compound treatment relative to the untreated group.<br>

Moreover, C57/BL6J mice (male, 4 week old) which received high fat diet (60% fat) for 10-11 weeks and showed hyperglycemia and insulin resistance were chosen to carry out similar experiments (oral administration for 14 days but once a day) as described above. The extents of suppression of blood glucose and insulin levels were measured as mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 7. To check possible adverse side effects caused by the administration of the compound, the weight, heart weight and liver weight of each mouse were measured. GPT and GOT values were also calculated by employing a kit available in the market. The results are listed in Table 8.<br>

As shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8, the inventive compound has an excellent effect in lowering both blood glucose and insulin levels, when it is administered by either orally or intraperitoneally with no side effects such as weight gain, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity.<br>
