				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:-<br>
The Invention describes an improved Group Housing Distribution System made of engineering plastic to house isolator /circuit breaker as incoming, bus bar distribution system and miniature circuit breakers as outgoing protection units for each outgoing circuit.<br>
The system is of a novel design to achieve excellent distribution system in a compact manner. The connections are taken from isolator with solid connectors directly on bus bars for a system and from bus bars again connections are taken to solid connectors and then to miniature circuit breakers. This provides a robust and trouble free connectivity and distribution among all phases.<br>
In this invention enclosed hinges form part of the moulded box and cover and their housing is moulded along with the base &amp; cover. The screw to fix the hinges are screwed only from inside the box and once the box is closed no screw is visible or approachable from outside. Hinges can vary in shape, size and looks as required. U champs for closing purposes are provided. U clamps can vary in shape, size and looks as required. Sealing provision is made. The design is such that any tampering in visible and therefore can be recorded.<br>
The other option is to have round shaped mouldings on one edge of the base &amp; cover having a round hole. When the cover is fixed on the box a<br>
pin is inserted in the holes &amp; sealed inside these round moulded parts. This acts as hinges of the box.<br>
Conventional distribution boxes are made of mild steel sheet metal fabricated construction. The bus bars are fitted on insulating supports. These supports are then fixed on the base of the box. The hinges of cover &amp; base of the box are normally fixed with screws / rivets which are visible from outside. The hinges can be tampered with easily &amp; box can be opened by manipulating the hinges. Similarly the other side of the box is closed by means of bolts / screws or knobs. Even these fixing means can be tampered with easily. To provide water / dust protection from out side weather, rubber gasket channel is fabricated on the box by sheet metal works. This does not provide proper sealing protection. The conventional distribution boxes are susceptible to rusting, thereby, resulting in dangerous short circuit &amp; fires.<br>
EXISTING SCENARIO<br>
No such group housing systems are available, the purpose is achieved in a different manner, i.e.<br>
(i)     A separate board for isolator/circuit breakers is provided which<br>
is duly wired for incoming cable &amp; outgoing cable. (ii)    The cable from outgoing cable then enters a metal box having bus bars. These are called bus bar chambers . From the bus bars, the connections are taken through cables and wired into another enclosure of miniature circuit breakers. These are also made of<br>
mild steel &amp; have the same inherent problems as in case of bus bar chambers &amp; are prone to tamper.<br>
From the above it can be seen that to provide distribution different enclosures/ boxes are used. These need to be connected with each other with cables. This needs lot of cumbersome wiring &amp; space &amp; equipments.<br>
The system therefore has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	It can be tampered with easily by manipulating screw / rivet, knobs.<br>
2.	The conventional sheet metal boxes can become live if any loose wires<br>
or inside fitting starts touching the box.<br>
3.	It can be fatal if someone touches it.<br>
4.	It can be rusted easily and water &amp; dust can enter the box.<br>
5.	Design limitations are there to provide gaskets etc.<br>
6.	It occupies more space &amp; connecting cables.<br>
7.	Prone to faults.<br>
How this invention seeks to solve the problem<br>
Instead of installing individual isolator/circuit breaker, bus bar chamber &amp; MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) boxes, a composite compact and robust system has been designed as shown in Exhibits.<br>
For the purpose of explanation an example of one incoming &amp; 4 No. of circuits as outgoing has been taken. These can be made into multiple incoming &amp; multiple outgoing units as may be required.<br>
The exhibits are: -<br>
Exhibit.1- Tamper proof moulded in engineering plastic distribution box<br>
for group housing with cover closed.<br>
Exhibit.2- Tamper proof moulded in engineering plastic distribution box with hinges -no screw/rivet visible from outside.<br>
Exhibit.3- Tamper proof moulded in engineering plastic group housing<br>
distribution box with cover open.<br>
In the exhibit the following can be seen.<br>
(i)      Isolator fixed on the base by channels to suit its fittings, (ii)     Outgoing connector links, (iii)   Bus bar (iv)    Bus bar supports (v)     Inter connections strips (vi)   Connectivity to facilitate connection of MCB's. (vii)   MCB's for outgoing circuits (viii) Neutrals provided on both side.<br>
One moulded enclosure box moulded in engineering plastics with built in features like.<br>
i)       Internal hinge fixing arrangement.<br>
ii)      Rubber gasket fixing channels.<br>
iii)     Bus bar fixing studs on the base of the box.<br>
iv)    Sealing &amp; locking arrangement.<br>
v)      Inlet &amp; outlet holes.<br>
vi)	Provision for tamper proof arrangement,<br>
vii)	Fixing arrangement of bus bars,<br>
viii)	Base fixing holes.<br>
ix)	Outer flanges to impart strength &amp; provision for gasket,<br>
x)	Openable window with closing and sealing provision .<br>
In the moulded boxes it is possible to provide such features as described above easily and in an efficient manner.<br>
In the moulded tamper proof box for group housing, the features are provided in the moulding itself and do not have to be fabricated. As such these features form part and parcel of the box itself imparting tamper proof features. Incase any person / body tries to tamper the box it looses its original shape and cannot be repaired. Even if it is repaired, it will show by itself the repaired portion and make it evident that the box has been tampered with. The design is such that any tampering is visible and therefore can be recorded. The bus bars are fixed on studs provided on the base of the box.<br>
Statement of invention:<br>
An improved tamper proof distribution box to house group housing system consisting of a base and cover moulded with engineering plastics with built in features like internal hinge fixing arrangement and no screws /rivets visible from outside when the box is closed, rubber fixing<br>
channel forming part of the moulding, group housing system fixing studs, sealing and locking fixing arrangement, inlet &amp; outlet holes base fixing holes providing shock and tamper proof system. The distribution box made of insulating material is not affected by electric shocks.<br>
Moulded openable window is provided for cut in / out power supply through MCBs as required. It is also provided with closing and sealing provision.<br>
More than 1 connection is provided in various combinations of single phase/two phase/three phase/three phase &amp; neutral of power supply for incoming and outgoing circuits.<br>
An improved U clamps arrangement is provided for closing purposes with sealing arrangement. The distribution box can be used not only for group housing system but also for other electrical accessory and fitting like circuit breaker, MCCM's, isolators, switching system, latching relays, contactors/GSM-CDMA modem, control systems, PLCC and similar other equipments.<br><br><br><br><br>
