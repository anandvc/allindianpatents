				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates toAdetergent composition! or components thereof containing a specific cationic surfactant for use under alkaline wash conditions, having a carefully selected counterion. The detergent compositions of the invention are for use in any field of detergency, including household cleaners but are generally for use in laundry and dish washing processes to provide enhanced greasy stain removal and cleaning benefits.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is known to use cationic surfactants in detergent compositions. For example, GB 2040990A describes granular detergent compositions comprising cationic surfactants.<br>
EP-A-121949 also describes cationic surfactants for use in laundry detergent compositions. This reference describes a broad class of cationic surfactants.<br>
The Applicants have found that a particular group of quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants gives good cleaning properties, especially on greasy, oily stains.<br>
The cationic compounds have been found to be particularly beneficial in detergent compositions which additionally comprise anionic surfactants. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the Applicant believes that the particular cationic surfactants used in the detergent compositions of the present invention have surprisingly good solubility. In addition, they form an association in the presence of anionic components to produce surprisingly soluble anionic/cationic complexes which lead to unexpected performance benefits: the cationic surfactant rapidly and effectively contacts greasy stains and rapidly penetrates and breaks down the stain giving effective greasy stain removal.  Furthermore, it is believed that following breakdown of the oily soil the cationic surfactants used in the present invention also form complexes with the fatty acids and any other negatively charged breakdown product produced, increasing their solubility and enhancing greasy, oily soil removal and overall cleaning performance.<br>
However, in processing or in use in alkaline detergent conditions, it has been found that some cationic surfactants may produce malodours in the washing liquor. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, the Applicants believe that malodours arise due to exchange of the counterion of the cationic surfactant with hydroxide ions in the aqueous alkaline wash liquor. The<br><br>
quaternary ammonium hydroxide product which results may then produce malodorous amine bi-products. In order to avoid this problem in use in alkaline conditions the particular cationic surfactants should have a counterion which has a higher relative selectivity for the.cationic surfactant than a hydroxide ion in aqueous solution under the conditions of use.<br>
All documents cited in the present description are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a detergent composition having a pH of at least 8.0 in an aqueous solution at a concentration of 0.5% by weight, or component thereof, which comprises a cationic surfactant of formula I:<br>
RlR2R3R4N+X-	(I)<br>

According to the present invention there is provided a detergent composition having a pH from 8.0 to 14.0 solution at a concentration of 0.5% by weight, or a component thereof, comprising<br>
(a) a cationic surfactantsof formula I:<br>

in which R1 is a hydroxyalkyl group having no greater than 6 carbon atoms; each of R2 and R is independently selected from C1-4 alkyl or alkenyl; R is a C5-11 alkyl or alkenyl; and X" is a counterion which does not substantially exchange with hydroxide ion in a 0.5% by weight aqueous solution of the detergent composition at 200C,'<br>
and (b)  anionic surfactants the weight ratio of anionic to cationic surfactant preferably being in the range 50:1 to 2:1;and<br><br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
, Cationic surfactant<br>
The cationic surfactant is generally present in the composition or component thereof in an amount no greater than 60% by weight, preferably no greater than 10% by weight, most preferably in an amount no greater than 4.5% or even 3% by weight. The maximum amount of '. cationic surfactant may even be as low as 1% by weight. The benefits of the invention are found even with very small amounts of the cationic surfactant of formula I. Generally there will be at least 0.01% by weight, preferably at least 0.05% or at least 0.1% by weight of the cationic. surfactant in the detergent compositions of the invention.<br>
R.1 in formula I is a hydroxyalkyl group having no greater than 6 carbon atoms and preferably the —OH group is separated from the quaternary ammonium nitrogen atom by no more than 3 carbon atoms. Preferred R1 groups are —CH2CH2OH, —CH2CH2CH2OH, — CH2CH(CH3)OH and—CH(CH3)CH2OH.<br>

Preferably R2 and R3 are each selected from ethyl and methyl groups and most preferably both R2 and R3 are methyl groups. Preferred R4 groups have at least 6 or even at least 7 carbon atoms. R4 may have no greater than 9 carbon atoms, or even no greater than 8 or 7 carbon atoms. R4may beC5-9 orC11   Preferred R4 groups are linear alkyl groups.

The counterion, X in formula I, may be any counterion which does not substantially exchange with a hydroxide ion in a 0.5% by weight aqueous solution of the detergent composition at 20°C, so that formation of malodorous compounds is substantially avoided.<br>
A suitable method for determining whether the counterion does not substantially exchange with a hydroxide ion is descrived in J. Phys. Chem. 1986,90, 3366-3368    " Use of Reactive Counterion Type Micelles for the Determination of Selectivity Coefficients" by Maria da Graca<br><br>

Suitable counterions generally have greater electronegativity than hydroxide ions. Preferred examples are chloride, bromide and nitrate ions. Chloride is particularly preferred.<br>
Whilst pure or substantially pure cationic compounds are within the ambit of this invention, it has been found that mixtures of the cationic surfactants of formula I may be particularly effective, for example, surfactant mixtures in which R4 may be a combination of C8 and C10 linear alkyl groups, or C9 and C11 alkyl groups. According to one aspect of the invention a mixture of cationic surfactants of formula I is present in the composition, the mixture comprising from a shorter alkyl chain surfactant of formula I and a longer alkyl chain surfactant of formula I.

In the mixed cationic surfactant systems, generally there will be form 5 to 95% by weight of longer alkyl chain surfactants, preferably from 30 to 95%, more preferably form at least 50% by weight based on the total cationic surfactant. Generally there will be from 5 to 95% by weight shorter alkyl chain surfactant, preferably from 5 to 70T by weight, more preferably 35 to 65% by weight. Preferably there will be at lest 40% by weight shorter alkyl chain surfactant based on the total cationic surfactant in the detergent composition or component thereof.<br>

The detergent compositions or components thereof in accordance with the present invention may also contain additional detergent components. The precise nature of these additional components, and levels of incorporation thereof will depend on the physical form of the composition or component thereof, and the precise nature of the washing operation for which it is to be used.<br>

Suitable SRA's include a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer comprised of an oligomeric or polymeric ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyalkyleneoxy repeat units and allyl-derived sulfonated terminal moieties covalently attached to the backbone, for example as described in U.S. 4,968,451, November 6, 1990 to J.J. Scheibel and E.P. Gosselink. Such ester oligomers can be prepared by: (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol; (b) reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene glycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure; and (c) reacting the product of (b) with sodium metabisulfite in water.

Such materials are available as METOLOSE SMI00 and METOLOSE SM200, which are the trade names of methyl cellulose ethers manufactured by Shin-etsu Kagaku Kogyo KK.<br><br>
Additional classes of SRA's include: (I) nonionic terephthalates using diisocyanate coupling agents to link polymeric ester structures, see U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et al. and U.S. 4,240,918 Lagasse et al.; and (II) SRA's with carboxylate terminal groups made by adding trimellitic anhydride to known SRA's to convert terminal hydroxyl groups to trimellitate esters. With the proper selection of catalyst, the trimellitic anhydride forms linkages to the terminals of the polymer through an ester of the isolated carboxylic acid of trimellitic anhydride rather than by opening of the anhydride linkage. Either nonionic or anionic SRA's may be used as starting materials as long as they have hydroxyl terminal groups which may be esterified. See U.S. 4,525,524 Tung et al.. Other classes include: (III) anionic terephthalate-based SRA's of the urethane-linked variety, see U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et al.;<br>
Other optional ingredients<br>
Other optional ingredients suitable for inclusion in the compositions of the invention include<br>
perfumes, colours and filler salts, with sodium sulfate being a preferred filler salt.<br>
Form of the compositions<br>
The compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, tablet, flake, pastille and bar and liquid forms. Liquids may be aqueous or non-aqueous and may be in the form of a gel. The compositions may be pre-treatment compositions or may be conventional washing detergents. The compositions are particularly the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.<br>
Such granular detergent compositions or components thereof in accordance with the present invention can be made via a variety of methods, including spray-drying, dry-mixing, extrusion, agglomerating and granulation. The cationic quaternised surfactant can be added to the other detergent components by mixing, agglomeration (preferably combined with a carrier material), granulation or as a spray-dried component.<br>
The compositions in accord with the present invention can also be used in or in combination with bleach additive compositions, for example comprising chlorine bleach.<br>
In one aspect of the invention the mean particle size of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention, should preferably be such that no more than 15% of the particles are greater than 1.8mm in diameter and not more than 15% of the particles are less than<br><br>
0.25mm in diameter. Preferably the mean particle size is such that from 10% to 50% of the particles has a particle size of from 0.2mm to 0.7mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of sieves, preferably Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention at last 80%, preferably at least 90% by weight of the composition comprises particles of mean particle size at least 0.8 mm, more preferably at least 1.0 mm and most preferably from 1.0, or 1.5 to 2.5 mm. Most preferably at least 95% of the particles will have such a mean particle size. Such particles are preferably prepared by an extrusion process.<br>
The bulk density of granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention typically have a bulk density of at least 400, preferably at least 600 g/litre, more preferably from 650 g/litre to 1200 g/litre. Bulk density is measured by means of a simple funnel and cup device consisting of a conical funnel moulded rigidly on a base and provided with a flap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of the funnel to be emptied into an axially aligned cylindrical cup disposed below the funnel. The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40 mm at its respective upper and lower extremities. It is mounted so that the lower extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base. The cup has an overall height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mm. Its nominal volume is 500 ml.<br>
To carry out a measurement, the funnel is filled with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup.  The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement eg; a knife, across its upper edge. The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/litre. Replicate measurements are made as required.<br>
Compacted solids may be manufactured using any suitable compacting process, such as tabletting, briquetting or extrusion, preferably tabletting. Preferably tablets for use in dish washing processes, are manufactured using a standard rotary tabletting press using compression forces of from 5 to 13 KN/cm2, more preferably from 5 to 1 1KN/cm2 so that the compacted<br><br>
solid has a minimum hardness of 176N to 275N, preferably from 195N to 245N, measured by a C100 hardness test as supplied by I. Holland instruments. This process may be used to prepare homogeneous or layered tablets of any size or shape. Preferably tablets are symmetrical to ensure the uniform dissolution of the tablet in the wash solution.<br>
Laundry washing method<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant from lOg to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods. Dosage is dependent upon the particular conditions such as water hardness and degree of soiling of the soiled laundry.<br>
The detergent composition may be dispensed for example, from the drawer dispenser of a washing machine or may be sprinkled over the soiled laundry placed in the machine.<br>
In one use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
The dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum before the commencement of the wash, before, simultaneously with or after the washing machine has been loaded with laundry. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
To allow for release of the detergent product during the wash the device may possess a number of openings through which the product may pass. Alternatively, the device may be made of a material which is permeable to liquid but impermeable to the solid product, which will allow release of dissolved product. Preferably, the detergent product will be rapidly released at the<br><br>
start of the wash cycle thereby providing transient localised high concentrations of product in the drum of the washing machine at this stage of the wash cycle.<br>
Preferred dispensing devices are reusable and are designed in such a way that container integrity is maintained in both the dry state and during the wash cycle. Especially preferred dispensing devices for use with the composition of the invention have been described in the following patents; GB-B-2, 157, 717, GB-B-2, 157, 718, EP-A-0201376, EP-A-0288345 and EP-A-0288346. An article by J.Bland published in Manufacturing Chemist, November 1989, pages 41-46 also describes especially preferred dispensing devices for use with granular laundry products which are of a type commonly know as the "granulette". Another preferred dispensing device for use with the compositions of this invention is disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. WO94/11562.<br>
Especially preferred dispensing devices are disclosed in European Patent Application Publication Nos. 0343069 &amp; 0343070. The latter Application discloses a device comprising a flexible sheath in the form of a bag extending from a support ring defining an orifice, the orifice being adapted to admit to the bag sufficient product for one washing cycle in a washing process. A portion of the washing medium flows through the orifice into the bag, dissolves the product, and the solution then passes outwardly through the orifice into the washing medium. The support ring is provided with a masking arrangement to prevent egress of wetted, undissolved, product, this arrangement typically comprising radially extending walls extending from a central boss in a spoked wheel configuration, or a similar structure in which the walls have a helical form.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No. 0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
Machine dishwashing method<br><br>
Any suitable methods for machine dishwashing or cleaning soiled tableware, particularly soiled silverware are envisaged.<br>
A preferred machine dishwashing method comprises treating soiled articles selected from crockery, glassware, hollowware, silverware and cutlery and mixtures thereof, with an aqueous liquid having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine dishwashing composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the machine dishwashing composition it is meant from 8g to 60g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 3 to 10 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine dishwashing methods.<br>
Packaging for the compositions<br>
Commercially marketed executions of the bleaching compositions can be packaged in any<br>
suitable container including those constructed from paper, cardboard, plastic materials and any<br>
suitable laminates. A preferred packaging execution is described in European Application No.<br>
