CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/953,730, filed on August 3, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a synchronizer actuating<br>
system, and more particularly to a synchronizer actuating system with selectives<br>
for use in a transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical dual clutch transmission (DCT) includes a plurality of<br>
gears actuated by a synchronizer actuating system. The synchronizer actuating<br>
system generally includes a synchronizer that is operable to engage a<br>
transmission gear set. The synchronizer is coupled to a moveable rail having an<br>
apply finger. The synchronizer is moveable by the apply finger and rail between<br>
various positions, including a neutral/detent position. The DCT typically has<br><br>
extra hydraulic pressure, and therefore the apply finger may be hydraulically<br>
actuated by a piston arrangement.<br>
[0005] One such piston arrangement includes three area pistons that<br>
engage the apply finger to hydraulically actuate the synchronizer actuating<br>
system. With a three area piston arrangement, it is possible to employ a<br>
hydraulic neutral position wherein hydraulic pressure is applied to all three<br>
pistons to place the apply finger in a neutral position.<br>
[0006] However, the neutral position of the three area pistons and<br>
therefore the neutral position of the apply finger with respect to the neutral<br>
position of the synchronizer may vary in any given transmission due to tolerance<br>
stacking and assembly issues. Therefore, there is room in the art for a<br>
synchronizer actuating system that calibrates the hydraulic neutral position of the<br>
piston arrangement with the neutral position of the synchronizer for any given<br>
transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] The present invention provides a synchronizer actuating system<br>
with selectives for use in dual clutch transmission.<br>
[0008] In one aspect of the present invention, the synchronizer<br>
actuating system includes an apply finger and a fork mounted on a shift rail. The<br>
fork grips a synchronizer sleeve that supports a synchronizer. The synchronizer<br>
is moveable to a neutral position. A three area piston assembly is operable to<br>
engage and actuate the apply finger. The three area piston assembly includes a<br><br>
hydraulic neutral position. A selective element is coupled to the synchronizer<br>
actuating system to calibrate the hydraulic neutral position of the three area<br>
piston assembly to the neutral position of the synchronizer sleeve.<br>
[0009] In another aspect of the present invention, the selective element<br>
is coupled to the apply finger.<br>
[0010] In still another aspect of the present invention, the selective<br>
element is coupled to the three area piston assembly.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0020] With reference to FIG. 1, a synchronizer actuating system is<br>
shown and generally indicated by reference number 10. The synchronizer<br>
actuating system 10 is configured to actuate a plurality of synchronizers 12 in a<br>
dual clutch transmission (not shown). The synchronizers 12 are operable to<br>
couple a plurality of gear sets 14 to shafts 16 or to another of the gear sets 14.<br>
Actuation of the synchronizers 12 by the synchronizer actuating system 10 allows<br>
the plurality of gear sets 14 within the transmission to produce a plurality of<br>
forward and reverse gear ratios. The synchronizers 12 are therefore moveable<br>
between a plurality of positions relative to the gear sets 14 and the shafts 16.<br>
The plurality of positions include a neutral position wherein the synchronizer 12<br>
does not couple the gear sets 14 to the shafts 16.<br>
[0021] The synchronizer actuating system 10 generally includes a<br>
plurality of synchronizer actuating elements or shifting assemblies 18 that are<br><br>
each coupled to a single synchronizer 12. In the particular example provided,<br>
four synchronizer actuating elements 18 and synchronizers 12 are illustrated,<br>
though it should be appreciated that any number of synchronizer actuating<br>
elements 18 and synchronizers 12 may be employed with any number of gear<br>
sets 14 and shafts 16 without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Each synchronizer actuating element 18 is substantially similar to another,<br>
accordingly, only one synchronizer actuating element 18 will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[0022] Each synchronizer actuating element 18 generally includes a<br>
shift rail 20. The shift rail 20 has a first end 22 opposite a second end 24. A<br>
synchronizer fork 26 is mounted on the shift rail 20 near the first end 22. The<br>
synchronizer fork 26 includes a pair of extending fork arms 28. The fork arms 28<br>
grip or are otherwise coupled to a synchronizer sleeve 30. The synchronizer<br>
sleeve 30 is sized to receive the synchronizer 12 therein.<br>
[0023] The synchronizer actuating element 18 further includes an apply<br>
finger or shifting member 32 mounted on the shift rail 20 near the second end 24.<br>
The apply finger 32 includes an extension 34 that extends out from the apply<br>
finger 32. The position of the apply finger 32 is fixed relative to the synchronizer<br>
12 such that movement of the apply finger 32 translates to movement of the<br>
synchronizer 12 between the plurality of synchronizer positions, including the<br>
neutral position.<br>
[0024] With reference to FIG. 2, the synchronizer actuating system 10<br>
is moved by an actuator or piston assembly 50. The piston assembly 50 is<br><br>
operable to actuate the synchronizer actuating element 18 via the apply finger<br>
32, as will be described further below. Accordingly, the number of piston<br>
assemblies 50 is equal to the number of synchronizer actuating elements 18. As<br>
each piston assembly 50 is substantially similar to another, only one piston<br>
assembly 50 will be described in detail. The piston assembly 50 includes an<br>
actuator body 52 having an inner surface 53 that defines a cylindrical bore 54.<br>
The actuator body 52 further defines an apply finger window 56 extending from a<br>
bottom surface 58 of the actuator body 52 to the inner surface 53. The apply<br>
finger window 56 is sized such that when the piston assembly 50 is installed<br>
within a transmission, the piston assembly 50 is located overtop the synchronizer<br>
actuating element 18 and the apply finger 32 extends through the apply finger<br>
window 56 into the cylindrical bore 54.<br>
[0025] A plurality of pistons are located within the cylindrical bore 54<br>
that include a first or large piston 60, a second or medium piston 62, and a third<br>
or small piston 64. The medium piston 62 is located within the cylindrical bore 54<br>
on an opposite side of the apply finger window 56 than the large piston 60 and<br>
the small piston 64.<br>
[0026] The medium piston 62 includes a body 66 having an outer<br>
surface 68 and an extending member 70 extending from a side of the body 66<br>
opposite the outer surface 68. A button 72 is located at an end of the extending<br>
member 70. The button 72 defines a contact surface 74 at a distal end of the<br>
button 72. Alternatively, the extending member 70 and the button 72 may be a<br>
single unitary piece having the contact surface 74 at a distal end of the extending<br><br>
member 70. The outer surface 68 of the medium piston 62 and the inner surface<br>
53 of the cylindrical bore 54 cooperate to define a first cavity 76 at an end of the<br>
cylindrical bore 54. A first passage 78 located within the actuator body 52 is<br>
connected to the first cavity 76. The first passage 78 is connected to a hydraulic<br>
fluid source (not shown).<br>
[0027] The small piston 64 is located within and concentric to the large<br>
piston 60. The small piston 64 includes a body 80 having an outer surface 82<br>
and an extending member 84 extending from a side of the body 80 opposite the<br>
outer surface 82. A bore 85 is formed in the body 80 and extends from the outer<br>
surface 82 into the extending member 84. A button 86 is located at an end of the<br>
extending member 84. The button 86 defines a contact surface 88 at a distal end<br>
of the button 86. Alternatively, the extending member 84 and the button 86 may<br>
be a single unitary piece having the contact surface 88 at a distal end of the<br>
extending member 84.<br>
[0028] The large piston 60 is operable to move relative to the small<br>
piston 64 and generally includes an inner surface 90 and an outer surface 92.<br>
The inner surface 90 defines a space 93 sized to receive the small piston 64<br>
therein. A hole 94 is located in the large piston 60 and extends from the inner<br>
surface 90 to the outer surface 92. The outer surface 92 of the large piston 60<br>
and the inner surface 53 of the cylindrical bore 54 cooperate to define a second<br>
cavity 96 at an end of the cylindrical bore 54. A second passage 98 located<br>
within the actuator body 52 is connected to the second cavity 76. The second<br>
passage 98 is connected to a hydraulic fluid source (not shown).<br><br>
[0029] The synchronizer actuating assembly 10 further includes a first<br>
selective element or first spacer 100 and a second selective element or second<br>
spacer 102 employed to calibrate the hydraulic neutral position of the piston<br>
assembly 50 with the neutral position of the synchronizer 12, as will be described<br>
in greater detail below. The first selective element 100 is located between the<br>
large piston 60 and the small piston 64. The first selective element 100 generally<br>
includes a planar disc portion 104 having an outer surface 106 and a snap<br>
member 108 extending from the planar disc portion 104 on an opposite side of<br>
the outer surface 106. The snap member 108 is sized to snap fit within the bore<br>
85 of the small piston 64 in order to secure the first selective element 100 to the<br>
small piston 64. In this position, the first selective element 100 is located overtop<br>
the outer surface 82 of the small piston 64 and within the space 93 of the large<br>
piston 60. The planar disc portion 104 is characterized as having a particular<br>
width, indicated by reference number 110.<br>
[0030] The second selective element 102 is located overtop an end of<br>
the extension 34 of the apply finger 32. More specifically, the second selective<br>
element 102 generally includes a hole 112 sized to receive an end 114 of the<br>
extension 34 therein. The second selective element 102 is characterized as<br>
having a particular wall width, indicated by reference number 116, between an<br>
outer surface 111 of the second selective element 102 and the hole 112.<br>
[0031] While in the particular example provided, both the first and<br>
second selective elements 100, 102 are simultaneously employed in the<br>
synchronizer actuating system 10, it should be appreciated that either selective<br><br>
element 100, 102 may be employed by itself without departing from the scope of<br>
the present invention. For example, FIG. 3 illustrates the synchronizer actuating<br>
system 10 having only the first selective element 100 and FIG. 4 illustrates the<br>
synchronizer actuating system 10 having only the second selective element 102.<br>
The selection of which selective element 100, 102 or combination thereof to<br>
employ may be base on various factors, such as the number of selective<br>
elements 100, 102 needed, availability of sizes, etc.<br>
[0032] With combined reference to FIGS. 1-4, the operation of the<br>
synchronizer actuating system 10 will now be described. During operation of the<br>
synchronizer actuating system 10, hydraulic fluid is provided to the first and/or<br>
second cavities 76, 96. The hydraulic fluid acts on the outer surfaces 92, 68, 82<br>
of the pistons 60, 62, 64 and moves the pistons 60, 62, 64 along an axis defined<br>
by the cylindrical bore 54 and indicated by reference number 99. As the pistons<br>
60, 62, 64 translate along the axis 100, depending on the pressure of the<br>
hydraulic fluid provided to the cavities 76, 96, one or both of the extensions 70,<br>
84 will engage and move the second selective element 102 and therefore the<br>
apply finger 32 of the synchronizer actuating element 18. Movement of the apply<br>
finger 32 in turn moves the shifting rail 20, the fork 26, the synchronizer sleeve<br>
30, and finally the synchronizer 12 along an axis parallel to the axis 100.<br>
Movement of the synchronizer 12 allows for various gear combinations within the<br>
transmission.<br>
[0033] The piston assembly 50 is actuatable by the hydraulic fluid to be<br>
positioned in a hydraulic neutral position, as is illustrated in FIG. 2. In the<br><br>
hydraulic neutral position, hydraulic fluid is provided to the cavities 76, 96 in an<br>
amount sufficient enough to move the large piston 60 against a stop 120 formed<br>
in the actuator body 52. The medium piston 62 then engages the second<br>
selective element 102 and urges the apply finger 32 against the button 86 of the<br>
small piston 64.<br>
[0034] In order to match the hydraulic neutral position of the piston<br>
assembly 50 with the neutral position of the synchronizer 12, the selective<br>
elements 100, 102 are selected during assembly of the transmission from various<br>
sizes or gauges. The sizes of the selective elements 100, 102 relate to the sizes<br>
of the widths 110, 116 either in combination or singly, depending on whether one<br>
or both of the selective elements 100, 102 are to be employed (see FIGS. 3 and<br>
4). Which particularly sized selective element 100, 102 to use may change for<br>
any given transmission and is based on the position of the apply finger 32 when<br>
the synchronizer 12 is in the neutral position relative to the location of the contact<br>
surface 88 of the small piston 64 when the large piston 60 is urged against the<br>
stop 120 when the piston assembly 50 is in the hydraulic neutral position.<br>
[0035] For example, in one embodiment of the present invention the<br>
sizes of the selective elements 100, 102 are determined by directly measuring a<br>
distance "S" (not specifically labeled in the Figures) between a surface 124 of the<br>
extension 34 of the apply finger 32 and the contact surface 88 of the button 86 on<br>
the small piston 64 when the synchronizer actuating element 18 and the<br>
synchronizer 12 are in the neutral position and the large piston 60 is forced<br>
against the stop 120. The surface 124 is the portion of the apply finger that<br><br>
engages the contact surface 88 on the button 86 of the small piston 64. The<br>
distance "S" may be directly measured using a measuring device, such as a<br>
caliper, inserted into the cylindrical bore 54 through a window 122 formed in the<br>
actuator body 52. Once the distance "S" has been determined, a first selective<br>
100 with a width 110 and a second selective 102 having a width 116 may be<br>
selected such that the summation of the widths 110 and 116 is approximately<br>
equal to the distance "S". Alternatively, when only one selective 100, 102 is<br>
employed, the widths 110, 116 are selected to be approximately equal to the<br>
distance "S".<br>
[0036] In another embodiment of the present invention, the distance<br>
"S" may be calculated from a plurality of other measurements that do not require<br>
that the window 122 be located in the actuator body 52. For example, turning to<br>
FIG. 5, a distance "A" may be measured from the surface 124 of the apply finger<br>
32 to the outer diameter of a dowel 126 coupled to the actuator body 52. Turning<br>
to FIG. 6, a distance "B" may be measured from the stop 120 through a window<br>
128 formed in the actuator body 52 to the outer diameter of a hole 130 that<br>
receives the dowel 126 therein. Returning to FIG. 2, a distance "C" may be<br>
measured from the contact surface 88 to an edge 132 of the large piston 60 that<br>
engages the stop 120. Distance "C" may be measured prior to the large piston<br>
60 and the small piston 64 being assembled within the actuator body 52. The<br>
distance "S" may then be calculated by subtracting distance "A" and distance "C"<br>
from distance "B". The appropriately sized selective element 100, 102 may then<br>
be selected using the calculated distance "S" in order to calibrate the hydraulic<br><br>
neutral position of the piston assembly 50 with the neutral position of the<br>
synchronizer 12.<br>
[0037] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
