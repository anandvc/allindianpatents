1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIBRINOGEN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AND THEIR USE<br>
2. NICHOLAS PIRAMAL INDIA LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of 100 Centre Point, Dr. Ambedkar Road, Parel, Mumbai-400 012. State of Maharashtra. India, an Indian company<br>
The following specification particularly describes this nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, which are antagonists	of<br>
fibrinogen receptors (FRAs), to pharmaceutical preparations comprising them,	to<br>
processes   for  their   preparation,   and   to   their  use   as   active   ingredients	in<br>
pharmaceuticals,  alone  or  in  combination  with  other therapeutic  agents,	in<br>
particular for the inhibition of platelet aggregation and for the treatment	of<br>
thrombotic disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Platelets are cell-like anucleated fragments, found in the blood of all mammals that support primary hemostasis by forming hemostatic plugs at sites of vascular injury. Thrombosis is the pathological condition wherein improper activity of the hemostatic mechanism results in intravascular thrombus formation. Activation of platelets and the resulting platelet aggregation has been associated with a variety of pathophysiological conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboembolic disorders, for example, the thromboembolic disorders associated with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, thrombotic disorders such as peripheral arterial disease, and diabetes.<br>
Glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa receptors (hereinafter referred to as GP Ilb/IITa receptors) are found on (he surface of platelets and belong to a superfamily of adhesion receptors known as integrins, which are composed of transmembrane glycoproteins containing a and p subunits. Fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are proteins that bind to and crosslink GP Ilb/IIIa receptors on adjacent activated platelets and thereby effect aggregation of platelets.<br>
The binding of fibrinogen is mediated in part by the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) recognition sequence which is common to the adhesive proteins that bind GP Ilb/IIIa receptors (Ferguson, J. J. and Zaqqa, M, Drugs, 1999, 58, 965 -982; Mousa, S. A and Bennett, J. S., Drugs of the future 1996, 21, 1141 - 1154; Ojima, I., Chakravarty, S. and Dong, Q., Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 1995,3,337-360).<br>
9<br><br>
Platelets are activated by a number of agonists that include adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, serotonin, arachidonic acid, collagen and adrenaline among others, which are released in the body as a result of various physiological reactions. Regardless of the nature of the stimuli involved in the activation of platelets, the final step of platelet aggregation is the binding of fibrinogen to the activated GP lib/Ilia receptors on the surface of platelets thereby cross-linking platelets. (J. Lefkovits, E. F. Plow, E. J. Topol 1995, New England Journal of Medicine, 332, 1553-1559). This makes GP Ilb/IIIa receptors ideal targets for inhibiting platelet aggregation. The development of GP Ilb/IIIa receptor antagonists would, therefore, provide an effective strategy for the control of platelet aggregation and hence thrombi formation (Bennett, J. S, Annual Reviews of Medicine, 2001, 52, 161 - 184).<br>
Cardiovascular diseases are among those that cause the highest mortality throughout the world. Thus, in order to prevent the cardiovascular diseases caused by platelet aggregation, there is an increased necessity for efficient anti¬platelet aggregating treatment with drugs possessing specific characteristics namely efficacy, negligible side effects and fast onset of action. Current antiplatelet drugs are effective against only one type of agonist; these include aspirin, which acts against arachidonic acid; ticlopidine, which acts against ADP; and hirudin, which acts against thrombin.<br>
Until recently, aspirin has been widely used as an inhibitor of platelet function (New England Journal of Medicine, 1994, 330, 1287). While the benefits of aspirin have been demonstrated, there are clinical limitations of this drug. These limitations have provided the impetus for the development of newer antithrombotic agents having therapeutic advantages over aspirin. Ticlopidine, a thienopyridine derivative, has also been effectively used in patients suffering cardiovascular diseases. However, this drug is associated with a number of serious side effects.<br>
Recently, a common pathway for all known agonists has been identified, namely the platelet GP Ilb/IIIa complex, which is the membrane protein mediating platelet aggregation (Phillips et al. Cell 1991, 65, 359-362), The development of<br><br><br>
GP Ilb/IIIa receptor antagonists represents a promising new approach for antiplatelet therapy.<br>
A fibrinogen receptor antagonist (hereinafter referred to as FRA) is an agent that inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet bound fibrinogen receptor GP Ilb/IIIa and thereby prevents platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Inhibition of platelet aggregation is a major target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Known fibrinogen receptor antagonists arc:<br>
1.	Monoclonal antibodies - e.g. abciximab<br>
2.	Parenteral compounds<br><br>
a)	Synthetic peptides - e.g. eptifibatide<br>
b)	Non peptide peptidomimetics - e.g. tirofiban<br>
3.	Oral compounds - e.g. roxifiban, gantofiban<br>
1.	Monoclonal antibodies:<br>
In 1985, a mouse monoclonal antibody against GP Ilb/IIIa, known as c7E3, was generated. Subsequently, the Fab fragment of a chimeric human-mouse genetic reconstruction of c7E3 (c7E3 Fab), known as abciximab, was used in clinical trials (Drugs of the Future, 1995, 20, 457 - 463). Abciximab was launched in 1995 on the US market, as an intravenous preparation.<br>
2.	Parenteral compounds:<br>
a)	Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic peptide (J. Med. Chemistry, 2000, 43, 3453-3473) was designed as a mimic of a snake venom peptide namely barbourin. Eptifibatide is effectively used for the inhibition of platelet aggregation.<br>
b)	Based on the observation that peptides containing the tripeptide Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) sequence function as fibrinogen receptor antagonists, scientists attempted the development of non-peptide peptidomimetics as inhibitors of platelet aggregation (Hartman et.al. J. Med. Chemistry 1992, 35. 4640-4642).<br><br><br>
A number of non-peptide fibrinogen receptor antagonists are known and are disclosed in the patents and other publications, which follow:<br>
JP 10-017469 discloses oxyisoindole derivatives possessing fibrinogen receptor<br>
antagonistic activity.<br>
EP-A-712844   discloses   condensed  ring  carboxylic   acid   compounds   having<br>
platelet GP Ilb/IIIa receptor antagonist activity that are useful for the prophylaxis<br>
and treatment of thrombotic diseases.<br>
EP-A-540334   discloses   isoindolinone   compounds   as   fibrinogen   receptor<br>
antagonists, which are used in inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen to blood<br>
platelets and for inhibiting the aggregation of blood platelets.<br>
WO  96/26187 discloses a series of 3,4-dihydro-l(li/)-isoquinolinone based<br>
compounds  as  fibrinogen  receptor antagonists  useful  for  inhibiting platelet<br>
aggregation with oral activity .<br>
Tirofiban, a non-peptide antagonist, developed by Merck &amp; Co. is the first agent<br>
of this class to be used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (Hartman G.<br>
D. et. al., J. Med. Chemistry, 1992, 35, 4640-4642).<br>
US-A-5 726 185 describes acetic acid derivatives useful for the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of illnesses which are caused by the binding of adhesive proteins to<br>
blood platelets and by blood platelet aggregation and cell-cell adhesion.<br>
US-A-5 378 712 describes N-acyl-alpha-aminocarboxylic acid derivatives and N-<br>
acyl-alpha-amino acid derivatives which are useful for the treatment or control of<br>
illnesses which are caused by the binding of adhesive proteins to blood platelets<br>
and by blood platelet aggregation and cell-cell adhesion.<br>
WO 93/07867  discloses substituted beta amino acid derivatives as platelet<br>
aggregation inhibitors.<br>
3. Oral compounds:<br>
There are currently no oral preparations on the market. Many compounds that had reached Phase III clinical trials had to be withdrawn due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects such as major bleeding episodes and thrombocytopenia.<br><br><br><br><br>
EP-A-483667 describes cyclic imino derivatives having aggregation inhibiting<br>
effects.<br>
WO 95/18619 describes bicyclic fibrinogen antagonists as inhibitors of platelet<br>
aggregation.<br>
WO 95/14683 discloses isoxazolines and isoxazoles that are useful as antagonists<br>
of the platelet GP llb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex for the inhibition of<br>
platelet aggregation, as thrombolytics and/or for the treatment of thromboembolic<br>
disorders.<br>
Gantofiban  is  a  platelet  GPIIb/ITIa  antagonist  for  the  treatment  of various<br>
thrombotic   diseases,   such  as   acute   coronary   syndromes   (J.   Gante   et   al.<br>
Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry letters, 1996, 6:20, 2425-2430); Cromafiban<br>
is an orally active GP Ub/IIIa antagonist, which was being developed by COR<br>
Therapeutics  as  a  potential  treatment  for  thromboembolic  disorders,  acute<br>
coronary  syndromes  and  stroke  (Scarborough R.M.,  et.al,  J  Med.Chemistry,<br>
2000,43:19,3453-3473).<br>
Even though several FRAs are described in the prior art, there is still a need to<br>
develop specific agents having fibrinogen receptor antagonistic activity in the<br>
advent   of   the   increased   mortality   rate   among   patients   suffering   from<br>
cardiovascular diseases.<br>
The FRAs currently available are all intravenous preparations, limiting their use<br>
to a hospital environment. A clear clinical need and market exists for FRAs that.<br>
can be administered by more patient-compliant routes.<br>
A  focussed research on FRAs  by the present inventors  has resulted in the<br>
discovery of novel compounds. These compounds are effective inhibitors of GP<br>
llb/IIIa receptors. Moreover, the compounds of the invention inhibit GP llb/IIIa<br>
receptors with an efficacy comparable to the known FRAs, which are under<br>
clinical trials. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention are candidate<br>
agents for the treatment of thrombotic diseases.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

(i)        Preparation of variants of compound A-5:<br>
a)	The compound A^5 (RB is COR10) may be prepared by first protecting the amino group in compound A-3 with an appropriate protecting group (eg. phthaloyl) and then subjecting the resulting compound to Friedel-Crafts acylation with a suitable acylating agent, such as an acid chloride or an anhydride, followed by deprotection of the amino group by any conventional method known in the art.<br>
b)	The compound A-5 (RB is Cj-CJ5-alkyl) may be prepared by first protecting the amino group in compound A-3 with an appropriate protecting group (eg. phthaloyl) and then subjecting the resulting compound to Friedel-Crafts alkylation followed by deprotection of the amino group. Alternatively, said compound A-5 may be prepared by reducing the carbonyl group in the compound of the type A-5 (wherein RB is CO CrCi4-alkyl), which after reduction results in CH2C,-Cj4-alk\t according to a reported procedure (Synthesis, 763, 1978; Tetrahedron. 23. 2235, 1967).<br>
c)	The compound A-5 (R is halogen, such as CI, Br, I) may be prepared by treating compound A-3 with N-halosuccinimide in an organic solvent, such as DMF, acetonitrile, AcOH, CHC13, CS2, CII2C]2 or a mixture of at least two of said solvents, at a temperature ranging from 0°-100°C.<br>
d)	The compound A-5 (RB is OR10) may be prepared by first protecting the amino group in the compound A-5 (RB is CI, Br or I) with a suitable protecting group, such as Boc or Z, and subsequently treating the resulting compound with an alkali metal alkoxide in the presence of CuCI. CuBr or Cul in accordance with a reported procedure (Tetrahedron, 48, 3633, 1992; J. Org. Chem., 62, 5413, 1997), followed by deprotection of the amino group.<br>
e)	Compound A-5 (RB is SR10) may be prepared by treating the compound A-5 (RB is CI, Br or I) with CuSR10 in accordance with a reported procedure (J.Am.Chem.Soc, 81, 4927, 1959). The resulting compound  A-5  (RB  is  SR10)  may be  converted to  its corresponding<br>
44<br><br>
sulfoxide or sulfone [RB is S(0)R10 or S(0)2Rl°] by subjecting it to<br>
oxidation.<br>
f)	Compound A-5 (RB is NO2) may be prepared by first protecting<br>
the amino group in compound A-3 with a suitable protecting group (e.g.<br>
phthaloyl) and subjecting the resulting compound to a standard nitration<br>
reaction followed by deprotection of the amino group by any conventional<br>
method known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, prior to deprotection, the nitro group in the resulting compound may be reduced to the corresponding amino group by following the same procedure as described hereinabove for the conversion of compound A-l to compound A-3. The newly formed amino group may be protected with a different protecting group, such as Z or Troc, so that it is compatible with the phthaloyl group and does not interfere at the time of deblocking the phthaloyl protecting group. The phthaloyl group may then be removed to obtain the corresponding compound A-5 (RB is NHZ or NHTroc).<br>
Alternatively, the amino compound prior to deprotection of phthaloyl<br>
group   may   be   treated   with   an   appropriate   acid   chloride   or   a<br>
choloroformate using a standard procedure in the art to obtain the desired<br>
compound A-5 (RB is NHCOR10 or NHCOOR10).<br>
(ii)       The thus obtained variants of compound A-5 may be converted to<br>
the   corresponding   compound   A-6   by   a   procedure   as   described<br>
hereinabove for the conversion of compound A-3 to compound A-4.<br>
(iii)      The   compounds   H-72,   J-77   and  K-84   may  be   subjected  to<br>
alkylation and in situ cyclization with compound A-6 by a procedure as<br>
described above in process 1 -1, to obtain the desired compound A-8 (RA is<br>
CN, R  is as defined above and R  is absent).<br>
(iv)      Alternatively, the compound A-8 may also be obtained from<br>
compound A-7, which in turn can be obtained from compound A-6. The -<br>
CH?Br group in compound A-6 may be converted to -CH2CN or -<br>
45<br><br>
CH2CH2NO2 by using any conventional method. One such method for converting the -CH^Br group to -CH2CN is by treating the halide with an alkali metal cyanide or Zn(CN)2 in a suitable solvent, such as DMF. DMSO or alcohol. One method for converting the -CIEBr group to -CH2CH2NO2 is by treating the halide with nitro methane in the presence of a suitable base, such as NaOEt or NaH. The nitrile or nitro group is then reduced to an amino group by any conventional method known in the art. One such method involves catalytic hydrogenation as described hereinabove to obtain the compound A-7.<br>
The resulting compound A-7 may then be converted to the desired variants of compound A-8, wherein W is CH2CH2 (RC is H) and other symbols are as defined earlier, by alkylation followed by in situ cyclization with compounds designated herein as F-46, G-53, H-63. wherein R; is a leaving group, such as CI, Br, I, OMes and OTs, and J-74. The synthesis of the compounds F-46, G-53, H-63 and J-74 are described hereinafter in processes 6-1, 7-1, 8-1 and 9-1, respectively.<br>
Process 1 -4 for the preparation of other variants of compound A-8:<br>
(i)	The intermediates A-2. A-4 and A-6 may alkylate amines of<br>
the type H2N(CH2)nCRDRcCOOR' (wherein R' is Me/Et/CH2Ph) followed by cyclization to obtain a compound designated as A-9. Likewise, the intermediate A-7 may undergo alkylation with L3(CH2) nCRDRECOOR' to obtain the compound A-9.<br>
(ii)	The compound A-9 may be hydrolysed with aqueous LiOH in<br>
an organic solvent, such as MeOH, EtOH, iPrOH, THF, dioxane and<br>
DMF, to obtain the corresponding acid A-10. The protecting group (R1) of<br>
the ester, such as the benzyl group, may also be removed by catalytic<br>
hydrogenolysis of A-9 to obtain the corresponding acid A-10.<br>
(iii)	The acid thus obtained may then be coupled with compounds<br>
designated as K-81 or K-83 via a standard peptide coupling procedure, preferably with DCC, by a mixed anhydride method or by using any other<br>
46<br><br>
method for activation of the acid to give further variants of compound A-8.<br>
(iv) Alternatively, the acid A-10 may further be converted to its acid chloride A-11 by any conventional method, for example, by treating said acid with SOCl2. The thus obtained acid chloride may be coupled with compounds designated as K.-81 or K-83 in the presence of organic bases, such as TEA, pyridine or DIPEA and inorganic bases such as NaOH, Na2C03? or CSCO3. The synthesis of the compounds K-81 and K-83 are described hereinafter in process 10-1.<br>
(v) Alternatively, a suitably substituted mono or polyhydroxy phenol derivative, such as H65, H68 and G47, may be subjected to a Friedel-Crafts acylation with the acid chloride A-11 using a Lewis acid catalyst or by using activated 2n as reported in the literature (Synth. Commun, 28, 2203, 1998), to obtain yet another variant of compound A-8.<br>

The preparation of variants of the key intermediate B-19 and B-20 by alternative reaction sequences is described below by the processes designated as processes 2-1, 2-2, 2-3 and 2-4, which are schematically presented in Figure B:<br>
Process 2-1 for the preparation of compounds B-20 (R  is H):<br>
(i)	4-Methylbenzoic acid may be treated with bromine in presence<br>
of AgNCh according to a reported method (J. Org. Chem., 25, 1024. 1960) to obtain 3-bromo-4-methylbenzoic acid. The methyl group in the resulting compound may be oxidized by any conventional oxidizing agent, for example, alkaline potassium permanganate at a temperature ranging from 50°-100°C for 2-6 hr to obtain the corresponding dicarboxylic acid. The resulting dicarboxylic acid (Beil, 9, IV, 3335) may be esterified by refluxing with an appropriate alcohol (e.g. EtOH) in presence of a mineral acid or by treatment with SOCli followed by addition of an appropriate alcohol (e.g. EtOH) to give a compound designated as B-12.<br>
47<br><br>
(ii)	The bromo compound B-12 may then be converted to a cyano<br>
compound by treating it with a reagent, such as CuCN, alkali metal cyanide or Zn(CN)2, in a solvent, such as pyridine, DMF, a lower alcohol, or pyrrolidone; at a temperature ranging from 50°-150°C for 3-24 hr. The resulting cyano compound may then be subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in a solvent, such as an alcohol, AcOH, chloroform, DMF, or a mixture of at least two of said solvents, at 200-500 psi, preferably in an alcohol and chloroform mixture over PtCh at 400 psi for 2-8 hr to obtain a compound designated as B-13, wherein B is, for example, halogen, acetate or formate.<br>
(iii)	The compound B-13 may then be subjected to alkylation<br>
with RG(C=RF)CRDRE(CH2)nT3 and in situ cyclization to obtain a compound designated as B-16, wherein the groups RK, RL, Ru and Rv are the same as the ring substituents in the definition of RG. In compound B-16, RG is not substituted with a -COOR group. The ester group (RA= -COOEt) in compound B-16 may be converted to a cyano group by any conventional method, for example, through amide formation followed by dehydration by a number of reagents well known in the art, to obtain a compound designated as B-17, wherein RA- -CN.<br>
Alternatively, the ester group (RA) in the compound B-16 may be converted to a -(CH?) PCN group by a number of synthetic steps. These steps involve hydrolysis of an ester to an acid, reduction of the resulting acid to an alcohol by any conventional reducing agent, such as NaBH4 -mixed anhydride (except in cases in which RF is O and S). The resulting alcohol is converted to a leaving group such as halide, mesyl or tosyl, by a standard procedure well known to those skilled in the art. This is followed by treatment with alkali metal cyanide by a known procedure. (Vogel's Textbook of Practical Org. Chem, 5th edition, 714). The benzyl group of B-16 to B-18 can be removed by a known method such as catalytic hydrogenolysis or by treatment with silyl iodide particularly in those compounds wherein Rf' is O, in a solvent such as<br>
48<br><br>
CH2CI2, CHCI3, DMF, benzene, toluene, THF or dioxane, at ambient to reflux temperature for 2-18 hr.<br>
(iv)	The phenolic OH group formed by the removal of the benzyl<br>
group in B-16 to B-18 may be finally coupled with L-(CH2)qCR23R24COR25 by a standard procedure to afford the desired key intermediate B-20 (where RA - -(CH2)PCN).<br>

described above, in a manner similar to that described in process 1-3 for<br>
the preparation of variants of compound A-5.<br>

49<br><br>
(iii) In yet another variation, the substituted 2-halo benzoate ester may be treated with a reagent, such as ZNH-CH2CRB:=CRC-L, in the presence of a Pd- or Ni- based catalyst. This can be followed by reduction of the nitro group and double bond to give another variant of B-14. The reduction of the double bond is optional.<br>
(iv)	Similarly, the substituted 2-halo benzoate ester may be treated<br>
with RpO-CRB=CRc-L. Removal of the protecting group (Rp) from the<br>
resulting enol ether will give a keto compound. The keto compound may<br>
undergo reductive amination to obtain a diamine. The amino group in the<br>
side chain may be protected selectively, using reagents such as Z, Fmoc<br>
or Troc, to give further variants of compound B-14.<br>

thioanisole (J.C.S. Chem. Commun. 101, 1980) or any other standard<br>
reagent used for deprotection such as 2N HBr in AcOH for the removal of<br>
the Z group to obtain a compound designated as B-19.<br>

For this, B-14 may be used in which the amino group substituted on the phenyl ring may be in the unprotected or protected (with groups, such as phthaloyl, Fmoc or Troc, which are compatible with Z) form.

Compounds according to the general formula (I) can be used to antagonize the activity of GP Ilb/IIIa receptors and are beneficial pharmaceutical compounds for the treatment of various thrombotic diseases. In the context of the present invention, compounds of this invention may be administered to patients, where prevention of thrombosis by inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet membrane glycoprotein complex GPIIb/IIIa receptor is desired. This would include patients with cardiovascular (arterial and/or venous) and cerebrovascular thromboembolic diseases, under which the following can be included (though are not limited to):<br>
1.	arterial thromboembolism<br>
2.	cerebral thromboembololism<br>
3.	cerebral arterial thrombosis<br>
4.	coronary thrombosis<br>
5.	deep vein thrombosis<br>
6.	diabetes-related thromboembolic disorders<br>
7.	sudden ischemic emergencies<br>
8.	myocardial infarction<br>
9.	pulmonary thromboembolisms<br>
10.	stroke<br>
11.	thrombophlebitis<br>
12.	transient ischemic attack<br>
13.	unstable angina and venous thrombosis<br>
14.	kidney thromboembolism<br>
These compounds are useful during surgery on peripheral arteries (arterial grafts, carotid endarterectomy) and cardiovascular surgery where manipulation of arteries and organs, and/or the interaction of platelets with artificial surfaces, such<br><br><br>
as surgical instruments and the heart-lung machine leads to platelet aggregation. The aggregated platelets may form thrombi and thromboemboli. Compounds of this invention may be administered to these surgical patients to prevent such complications. (S. D. Berkowitz, American Heart Journal, 2001, 142, 7 - 13).<br>
Extracorporeal circulation is routinely used for cardiovascular surgery in order to oxygenate blood. Platelets adhere to surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit. Adhesion is dependent on the interaction between GP Ilb/IIIa receptors on the platelet membranes and fibrinogen adsorbed to the surface of the circuit (Gluszko et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1987, 252(H), 615-621,). Platelets released from an artificial surface show impaired hemostatic function. Compounds of this invention may be administered to prevent this adhesion.<br>
Other applications of these compounds include (though are not limited to):<br>
1.	prevention of platelet thrombosis<br>
2.	thromboembolism and reocclusion during and after thrombolytic therapy and<br>
prevention of platelet thrombosis<br>
3.	thromboembolism and reocclusion after angioplasty or coronary artery bypass<br>
surgery<br>
4.	prevention of myocardial infarction<br>
5.	prevention of blood clots after orthopedic surgery<br>
Cell adhesion (cell-cell or cell-matrix) involves processes that require proteins like fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin and vWF. These proteins bind to the integrin superfamily of receptors to produce their action. Thus, GP Ilb/IIIa antagonists which antagonize the integrin superfamily of receptors may be useful in diseases, other than the above, which involve cell adhesion processes. Such diseases include (though are not limited to):<br>
1.	adult respiratory distress syndrome<br>
2.	allergies<br>
3.	asthma<br><br><br>
4.	rupture of atherosclerotic plaques<br>
5.	autoimmune diseases<br>
6.	inflammation,<br>
7.	bone degradation<br>
8.	contact dermatitis<br>
9.	diabetic retinopathy<br>
10.	eczema<br>
11.	graft versus host disease<br>
12.	inflammatory bowel disease<br>
13.	metastasis<br>
14.	organ transplantation rejection<br>
15.	osteoarthritis<br>
16.	osteoporosis<br>
17.	psoriasis<br>
18.	rheumatoid arthritis<br>
19.	septic shock<br>
20.	tumors<br>

The efficacy of the present compounds in antagonizing the activity of the fibrinogen receptor can be determined by a number of pharmacological assays well known in the art, such as described below, The exemplified pharmacological assays, which follow herein below, have been carried out with the compounds of the present invention and their salts.<br>
In vitro Biological Experiments<br>
Human blood (150 ml) was collected from the ante-cubital vein of normal healthy volunteers (who were not on any medication for the past two weeks), into a siliconized glass bottle containing 25 ml of acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) solution and 10 units of hirudin. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 200 X g for 20 min at room temperature. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was separated and the platelet count read using a Beckman Coulter ACT diff Counter. The tubes were centrifuged again at 2000 X g for 10 min at room temperature, to get platelet-free plasma (PFP). The platelet count of PRP was adjusted to 3 X 108 platelets/ml by appropriate dilution with PFP. All in vitro experiments were conducted using PRP with adjusted number of platelets.<br>
Inhibition of platelet aggregation in human PRP (Bom, G. V. R.; Cross, M. J., J. Physiol, 1963, 168, 175)<br>
PRP was incubated with different concentrations of the test compound for 3 min at 37°C. Platelet aggregation was then induced by the addition of ADP (5-15u.M final concentration). Percent inhibition of platelet aggregation was then calculated by comparing test aggregation values with control values (Table 1).<br>

Biotinylation of Fibrinogen<br>
Fibrinogen was dialyzed against 0.1 M NaHCCh, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.2 and spun in an ultracentrifuge at 1,00000 X g for 30 minutes at 4°C to remove any particulate matter. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Solid sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimido-biotin (0.2 mg of biotin ester/ml of adhesive protein) was added and gently mixed end-over-end for 30 minutes at room temperature. The unreacted biotin ester was removed by exhaustive dialysis against 50 mM Tris.HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% NaN3, pH - 7.4 at 4°C. The biotinylated fibrinogen is stored at 4°C until use.<br>

Method<br>
The GP Ilb/IIIa protein (1 mg/ml) was diluted 1:200 with a Triton X-100-free buffer containing 20mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCI2, 0.02% NaN3 (Buffer A). This protein was immediately added to 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon II - Dynatech) at 0.1 ml (0.5 mg) per well and incubated overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed once with 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4 (buffer B). The unbound sites were then blocked by incubating the wells with 0.1 ml solution buffer B containing 35 mg/ml BSA, for 2 hours at 30°C. The wells were washed again with buffer B containing 1 mg/ml BSA (incubation buffer). The fibrinogen receptor antagonists were added simultaneously with biotinylated fibrinogen, so as to induce competition for binding to the gpIIb/IIIa receptor. Biotinylated fibrinogen {0.1 ml/well) was added at a final concentration of 10 nM and incubated for 3 hours at 30°C. After incubation, the wells were aspirated completely and washed once with 250 ul of binding buffer. Bound fibrinogen was quantitated by addition of 0.1 ml of Streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution). The wells were then washed with incubation buffer and 100 ul of the substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride was added. (The substrate was prepared daily following the manufacturer's instructions - 1 mg/ml of substrate prepared in DMSO was added to 9 ml of citrate buffer, pH = 4). The kinetics of colour development was followed at 450 nm (Ref filter - 630 nm) using a microtiter plate reader.<br>

Thrombocytopenia in Guinea Pigs : (Voelkl K-P., Dierichs, R. Thromb. Res.<br>
1986,42,11-20)<br>
Guinea pigs weighing between 500-800 g were orally fed the test compound. After a fixed time interval the guinea pigs were anaethesized and the carotid<br><br><br>
artery and jugular vein were cannulated. Blood samples were collected from the carotid artery. After collection of the control blood sample (0 min), collagenase (10 mg/kg) was administered through the jugular vein. The endothelium gets damaged by the action of collagenase and causes platelets to aggregate at this site, thereby inducing thrombocytopenia. At every minute thereafter till 10 min and at 15, 20, 25 and 30 min after the administration of collagenase, blood samples were collected. The platelet count was read using the Beckman Coulter ACT diff Counter. All counts were compared with the 0 min (before administration of proaggregatory challenge) sample to determine the fall in the number of free circulating platelets. A graph of the number of platelets against time was plotted and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each animal. Percent protection was determined by comparing the AUCs of treated to control animals.<br>
Thrombus formation in Hamster:<br>
Hamsters weighing between 150-180 g were orally fed the test compound. After a fixed time interval they were anaesthetized and the abdominal aorta exposed. A copper wire with a one-centimeter long coil was inserted through the abdominal aorta, all the way up to the thoracic aorta. After 10 min the copper wire was withdrawn and the size of the thrombus, formed on the wire, determined by estimating the protein content. Percent inhibition of thrombus formation was determined by comparing the thrombi formed in the drug-treated group with those in the control group.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have an IC50 below lOOnM, for ADP-induced human platelet aggregation and -200 pM for fibrinogen binding. Efficacy studies in guinea pigs revealed that the compounds show a long duration of action. The compounds of the present invention also inhibited collagenase-induced thrombocytopenia in guinea pigs. Toxicity studies with some of these molecules revealed that the LD50 was &gt;1000 mg/kg, p.o., in mice and rats. They did not significantly increase the bleeding time in guinea pigs.<br><br><br>
