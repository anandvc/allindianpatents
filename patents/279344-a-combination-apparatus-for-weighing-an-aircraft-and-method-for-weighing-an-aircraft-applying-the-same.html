				<td>INTEGRATED AIRCRAFT SCALE AND LEVELING<br>
APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR USE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to integrated scales and leveling<br>
mechanisms for use with aircraft and, more specifically, to an apparatus and method<br>
for providing aircraft weight and balance procedures.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Prior-art devices use aircraft jacks and loads cells to jack, level, and weigh<br>
aircraft. These devices are dependant upon use of large aircraft jacks and<br>
procedures that involve some amount of risk when jacking the aircraft. In addition,<br>
the load cells, when used in conjunction with aircraft jacks, can be subject to<br>
erroneous readings during to side loading of the load cells. Furthermore, these<br>
methods are not always acceptable, particularly for military aircraft.<br>
Other prior-art devices use floor scales and electro-mechanical or hydraulic<br>
rams to measure the weight of the aircraft from the wheels. These electro-<br>
mechanical or hydraulic rams are used to place the aircraft in a level condition that is<br>
required for the weight and balance procedures and calculating the aircraft center of<br>
gravity. The problem with these systems is that the ram systems used to level the<br>
aircraft are normally fixed into one location of a facility making "spontaneous" facility-<br>
independent weight and balance procedures near impossible. The ram systems also<br>
require significant foundation work and pits in the floor that can trap flammable gases<br>
that are present in aircraft hangar operations. These pits must include specially<br>
designed ventilation systems to evacuate these gases.<br>
Although great strides have been made in the area of aircraft weight and<br>
balance procedures, many shortcomings remain.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is a need for apparatus and methods for obtaining a level weight<br>
measurement of an aircraft while the weight of the aircraft is on its wheels.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide apparatus and<br>
methods for obtaining a level weight measurement of an aircraft while the weight of<br>
the aircraft is on its wheels.<br>
A combination apparatus for weighing an aircraft has a plurality of weight<br>
scales, each scale being adapted to be supported by a support surface in a position<br>
for receiving landing gear of an aircraft thereon. At least one riser supports at least<br>
one scale above the support surface, and the height of each riser is selected to<br>
position an aircraft on the scales in a level attitude while a weight of the aircraft is<br>
being supported by the landing gear on the scales. At least one scale may be<br>
recessed in the support surface, and the height of each riser may be adjustable. The<br>
present invention provides for several advantages, including: (1) providing apparatus<br>
that allows the user to simultaneously level and weigh an aircraft; (2) providing<br>
mobile apparatus to eliminate the need for a dedicated site; and (3) providing<br>
improved methods for leveling and weighing an aircraft.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The present invention provides for low-profile floor scales with integral leveling<br>
capabilities and methods for use thereof. The present invention may be used on all<br>
models of wheeled aircraft, such as helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, tiltrotor aircraft,<br>
and other wheeled aircraft. The invention is particularly useful for aircraft that sit in a<br>
non-level attitude when the weight of the aircraft is on the wheels (the "weight on<br>
wheels" condition). In addition, or as an alternative, the present invention may also<br>
be used as a portable mechanism to weigh and balance any large "naturally" non-<br>
level items. Leveling may be done for each wheel independently. The apparatus<br>
and methods shown and described a safe, economical, and facility-independent<br>
 <br>
solution of performing aircraft weight and balance procedures. In addition, the<br>
benefits and advantages of the present invention provide for low cost, low<br>
maintenance, and the flexibility to be used on any level surface.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 through 3, example scale configuration 11 is shown<br>
configured for use with "off-the-shelf aircraft scales, such as the AC30-60 Platform<br>
Scale, which is produced by Intercomp Company of Minneapolis, MN. In addition,<br>
scale configuration 11 is shown configured for use with a particular aircraft, which in<br>
this case is an EH 101 helicopter. The tire diameters are 16.5in for the nose gear<br>
and 25.5 in. for the main gear, and the aircraft weight is 33,187 lbs. The wheelbase<br>
is 275 in., and the width between the two sets of main gear wheels (track) is 150 in.<br>
In the "weight on wheels" condition, the EH 101 sits with a 1.5° nose-up attitude.<br>
The EH 101 is used as the example aircraft for all specific configurations and<br>
methods described herein, though the apparatus and methods of the invention are<br>
equally applicable to other aircraft.<br>
Scale configuration 11 comprises a nose gear scale 13 and two main gear<br>
scales 15. Scales 13, 15 are flat scales adapted for positioning on a flat surface,<br>
such as floor 17. Nose gear scale 13 rests on floor 17, whereas main gear scales 15<br>
are supported above an approximately level floor 17 on risers 19. Risers 19 may be<br>
formed as a non-adjustable or adjustable rigid structure or may alternatively be one<br>
of other types, such as airbags, which may also provide for adjustability or the height<br>
of risers 19. Scales 13, 15 and risers 19 are positioned on floor 17 so that nose<br>
landing gear 21 and main landing gear 23 will simultaneously rest on scales 13, 15<br>
when helicopter 25 (shown in broken lines in Figure 3) is rolled onto scales 13, 15.<br>
For use with the EH 101 helicopter, wheelbase measurement 27 is 275 in. and track<br>
measurement 29 is 150 in.<br>
Scales 13, 15 each have a vertical thickness 30 of 4 in., and risers 19 have a<br>
vertical thickness of 7.2 in, which provides for a total height 31 of 11.2 in. This<br>
configuration lifts the main gear 15 above nose gear 13 by the height of risers 19,<br>
which lifts the rear portion of helicopter 25 to eliminate the 1.5° nose-up attitude of<br>
helicopter 25 and put helicopter 25 in a level attitude relative to floor 17. To allow for<br>
helicopter to easily be moved onto scales 13, 15, a nose gear ramp 32 is located<br>
 <br>
adjacent scale 13, and a main gear ramp 33 is located adjacent each scale 15.<br>
Helicopter 25 is rolled onto scales 13, 15 by rolling landing gear 21, 23 onto ramps<br>
32, 33. As shown in Figure 3, ramps 32, 33 create angled surfaces for landing gear<br>
21, 23 to roll up and onto scales 13, 15. In the embodiment shown, ramps 32, 33<br>
have a length 35 of 73 in. To prevent landing gear 21, 23 from rolling off the front of<br>
scales 13, 15, chocks 37, 39 are positioned adjacent scales 13, 15, respectively,<br>
opposite ramps 32, 33.<br>
To measure the weight of helicopter 25, helicopter 25 is rolled up ramps 32,<br>
33 and onto scales 13, 15, the measurements of which may be read individually at<br>
scales 13, 15 or may be read together on a central readout connected to scales 13,<br>
15. The advantage of using risers 19 is that the rear of helicopter 25 will be lifted, so<br>
as to put helicopter 25 in a level attitude relative to floor 17, and this provides for<br>
accurate weight measurement.<br>
When using rigid risers 19, it should be noted that risers 19 have a height<br>
chosen for use with particular aircraft, in that an aircraft having a different "weight on<br>
wheels" attitude will require rigid risers 19 having different heights and may require a<br>
riser 19 under nose gear scale 13. Even when using correctly sized risers 19, the<br>
aircraft may only be placed in an approximately level orientation, with the orientation<br>
having a front-to-rear and/or side-to-side error. The present invention provides for<br>
apparatus capable of further refining the attitude of the aircraft through fine<br>
adjustment, and these apparatus are described below.<br>
Referring to Figures 4 through 8, scale configuration 41 also comprises nose<br>
gear scale 13 and main gear scales 15. However, in scale configuration 41 nose<br>
gear scale 13 is recessed in a cavity 43 formed in floor 17, and main gear scales 15<br>
are supported above an approximately level floor 17 on risers 45. As shown in<br>
cross-section in Figure 6, cavity 43 is a generally rectangular recess formed in floor<br>
17, cavity having a depth 47 of 4 in. for positioning the upper surface of scale 13 in<br>
alignment with the surface of floor 17. When scale 13 is removed from cavity 43, a<br>
cover, such as cover 49 of Figure 7, may be inserted into cavity 43 to provide a<br>
generally uninterrupted surface of floor 17.<br>
 <br>
To provide for elimination of the nose-up attitude of helicopter 25, risers 45<br>
have a height of 3.2 in., which provides for a total height 51 of 7.2 in. As in the scale<br>
configuration 11, a ramp 53 is used to roll main gear 23 onto scales 15. However,<br>
because nose gear scale 13 is recessed into floor 17, no ramp is necessary for<br>
rolling nose gear 21 onto scale 13. Chocks 55, 57 are used to prevent helicopter 25<br>
from rolling forward and off of scales 13,15.<br>
In operation, scales are located in scale configuration 11 or configuration 41,<br>
and an aircraft is then towed up the ramps and onto scales 13, 15. To ensure that<br>
the weight measurements are accurate, it is desirable to take a first measurement,<br>
roll the aircraft off of scales 13, 15, and then roll the aircraft back onto scales 13, 15.<br>
In fact, it is desirable to perform three measurements to ensure accuracy. However,<br>
with the apparatus shown in Figures 1 through 8, the weight of the aircraft is not<br>
removed from scales 13, 15 until the aircraft is moved onto the ramps. This is<br>
undesirable, as the weight of the aircraft urges the aircraft down the ramps, requiring<br>
a tow vehicle, or other source of towing force, to hold the aircraft in position to be<br>
moved back onto scales 13, 15.<br>
Figure 9 shows an alternative embodiment of a scale assembly. Assembly 59<br>
comprises a scale 15 and a riser 61, riser 61 having being longer than risers 19, 45<br>
described above. Riser 61 rests on floor 17 and has a recessed surface 63on a<br>
forward portion of riser 61. Scale 15 is located on surface 63, which places an upper<br>
surface of scale 15 at approximately the same level as upper surface 65 of riser 61.<br>
A ramp 67 is located adjacent a rear portion of riser 61, and chocks 69, 71 are<br>
fastened at the front and rear, respectively, of riser 61 with fasteners 73. When<br>
installed, chocks 69, 71 prevent gear 23 from rolling off the front of riser 61 or down<br>
ramp 67.<br>
In operation, an aircraft is rolled onto ramp 67, as shown with gear 23 in<br>
position A, and then onto surface 65 of riser 61, as in position B. Chock 71 is<br>
installed to prevent rollback of gear 23 onto ramp 67. From position B, gear 23 may<br>
freely roll onto scale 15, as in position C, for a weight measurement and then back<br>
onto surface 65. The aircraft will then be rolled between position B and C for all<br>
 <br>
subsequent measurements. When the measurements are completed, chock 71 is<br>
removed, and gear 23 may then be rolled down ramp 67.<br>
One limitation of using scale configurations having ramps, such as those<br>
described above, is that the aircraft must be towed up the ramps. When towing up<br>
the ramps, the towing force may exceed the maximum allowable force on various<br>
components. For example, the EH101 has a towing load limit for the nose gear and<br>
main gear of 5440 lbs., and the aircraft is designed so that it is not damaged or bent<br>
at 1.125 the limit, such as with the use of a shear pin that fails prior to reaching the<br>
limit. Figure 10 shows the configuration when using a standard Intercomp ramp 73,<br>
with a length of 73 in. and a height of 4 in., together with a transition ramp 75, which<br>
has a length of 24 in. and a height that increases from 4 in. at the rear to 10.2 in. at<br>
the front. This height allows transition ramp to reach the height of a landing 77 of a<br>
riser 78, on which scale 13 is located. Riser has a total height of 11.2 in., and<br>
landing 77 provides a 1 in. angled transition from ramp 75. The angle of the upper<br>
surface of transition ramp 75 is approximately 15°, and when this angle is used to<br>
calculate towing force for the aircraft weight of 33,187 lbs., the approximate towing<br>
force required to move the aircraft up ramp 75 is 9,616 lbs. This exceeds the force<br>
allowed for the gear of an EH 101.<br>
Figure 11 shows a configuration like that shown in Figure 10, but with a<br>
transition ramp 79 replacing ramps 73, 75 for decreasing the angle gear 21 takes to<br>
move onto riser 78. Transition ramp 79 has a length of 97 in. and a height of<br>
approximately 10.2 in., which provides a continuous, reduced angle of approximately<br>
6° from the rear end of ramp 79 to the forward end at landing 77 of riser 78. When<br>
ramp 79 is installed, the towing force for an aircraft weighing 33,187 lbs. is reduced<br>
to approximately 3,754 lbs., which is well below the limit for an EH 101.<br>
To eliminate the need for ramps and provide for greatly reduced towing force,<br>
the present invention also provides for apparatus capable of lifting the landing gear<br>
to the level of the scales. Several embodiments of the apparatus are shown in<br>
Figures 12 through 21.<br>
 <br>
Figures 12 through 15 illustrate a scale assembly 81, comprising a scale 15,<br>
riser 83, chock 85, and movable ramp 87. Scale 15 rests on riser 83, and chock 85<br>
is located forward of scale 15 to prevent gear 23 from rolling forward and off of scale<br>
15. To lift gear 23 from floor 17 to the height of the upper surface of scale 15, ramp<br>
87 is provided with a drive mechanism that rotates ramp 87 between a loading<br>
position, which is shown in Figures 12 and 13, and a weighing position, which is<br>
shown in Figures 14 and 15. Ramp 87 is formed to have a "scoop" configuration,<br>
wherein first and second rectangular plates are rigidly joined at an angle by sides 93,<br>
95. Ramp 87 is rigidly joined to a drive mechanism, which may consist of, for<br>
example, a first gear 97 rigidly connected to ramp 87 and driven in rotation by a<br>
second gear 99, which is driven, for example, by an electric motor. In the loading<br>
position, plate 89 is oriented as adjacent and parallel floor 17. In the weighing<br>
position, plate 91 is oriented to be parallel to the upper surface of scale 15, and plate<br>
89 is angled upward to act as a rear chock.<br>
In operation, an aircraft is moved near scale assembly 81, so that gear 23 is<br>
located on plate 89 of ramp 87, as shown in Figure 12. The drive mechanism is then<br>
operated to rotate ramp 87 upward until plate 91 is parallel to the upper surface of<br>
scale 15, as shown in Figure 14, which positions gear 23 for rolling onto scale 15,<br>
which is shown in Figure 15. To remove the aircraft from the scales for a repeat<br>
measurement, gear 23 may be rolled back onto plate 91 of ramp 87, and then the<br>
aircraft may be rolled back onto scale 15.<br>
An alternative apparatus for lifting landing gear is shown in Figures 16 and 17.<br>
Scale assembly 101 comprises scale 15, riser 103, and movable ramp 105. Ramp<br>
105 is constructed similarly to ramp 87, with plate 107 being parallel to floor 17 when<br>
ramp 105 is in the loading position of Figure 16, and plate 109 being parallel to the<br>
upper surface of riser 103 and scale 15 when ramp 107 is in the weighing position of<br>
Figure 17. To move ramp 107 between the positions, a motor 111 rotates a<br>
jackscrew 113, which in turn moves a roller 115 forward and rearward relative to<br>
riser 103. As roller 115 moves rearward and further beneath plate 109 of ramp 107,<br>
roller 115 bears against the lower side of plate 109 and forces ramp 107 to move<br>
upward, lifting gear 23 and the aircraft.<br>
 <br>
Another alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 18 and<br>
19. Scale assembly 117 comprises scale 15, riser 119, and movable ramp 121.<br>
Ramp 121 is constructed similarly to ramp 87, with plate 123 being parallel to floor<br>
17 when ramp 121 is in the loading position of Figure 18, and plate 125 being<br>
parallel to the upper surface of riser 119 and scale 15 when ramp 121 is in the<br>
weighing position of Figure 19. To move ramp 121 between the positions, a motor<br>
127 rotates a jackscrew 129, which in turn operates a scissors jack 131. Jack 131<br>
has an extendable portion 133 that bears against the lower side of plate 125, and as<br>
jack 131 is operated, portion 133 extends and forces ramp 121 to move upward,<br>
lifting gear 23 and the aircraft. Alternatively, jack 131 may be a hydraulic jack.<br>
An additional alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 20.<br>
Scale assembly 135 comprises scale 15, riser 137, chock 139, and movable ramp<br>
141. Ramp 141 is constructed similarly to ramp 87, with plate 143 being parallel to<br>
floor 17 when ramp 141 is in the loading position (not shown), and plate 145 being<br>
parallel to the upper surface of riser 137 and scale 15 when ramp 141 is in the<br>
weighing position of Figure 20. To move ramp 141 between the positions, a motor<br>
within riser 137 rotates a jackscrew 147, which is threadingly engaged with a forward<br>
end 149 of a lever 151. Lever 151 rotates about a pivot 153, such that forward end<br>
149 of lever 151 moves in opposition to a rearward end 155 of lever 151, as shown<br>
in Figure 21. Rearward end 155 is pivotally connected to ramp 141, so that ramp<br>
141 moves with rearward end 155 for lifting gear 23 and the aircraft.<br>
As described above, use of risers with scales 13, 15 may only put the aircraft<br>
in an approximately level attitude, wherein a front-to-rear or side-to-side error exists.<br>
One method for fine leveling of the aircraft is to roll the aircraft off scales 13, 15 and<br>
add or remove shims. Preferably, this will be done with scales 15 only. Another<br>
method of fine leveling is available with use of airbag-type risers, in which the height<br>
of each riser can be adjusted to the required height to achieve a level attitude.<br>
The present invention also provides two additional apparatus providing for fine<br>
leveling. Figures 22 through 26 show an adjustable riser 157 that can be used as a<br>
replacement, for example, for risers 19 and 45. In addition, riser 157 can be<br>
incorporated in several of the embodiments of the invention. Riser 157 comprises<br>
 <br>
upper and lower blocks 159, 161 and two rollers 163, 165. Each block 159, 161 has<br>
a triangular longitudinal cross-section, such that a pair of angled surfaces 167, 169<br>
and 171, 173, respectively, is formed on each block 159, 161. Surfaces 167, 169 of<br>
upper block 159 are aligned with and face in opposition surfaces 171, 173 of lower<br>
block 161. Forward roller 163 simultaneously bears against surfaces 167 and 171,<br>
and rearward roller 165 simultaneously bears against surfaces 169 and 173. A<br>
jackscrew 175 threadingly engages a nut portion 176 of each roller 163, 165 for<br>
moving rollers 163, 165 forward and rearward, and this causes rollers 163, 165 to<br>
move upper block 159 vertically relative to lower block 161. A motor 177, which is<br>
shown in Figures 25 and 26, rotates jackscrew 175. A lower surface 178 of lower<br>
block 161 reacts against a support surface, and an upper surface 179 of upper block<br>
159 bears against a scale, such as scale 15 shown in phantom in Figure 22. In this<br>
manner, jackscrews 175 can be selectively rotated to cause rollers 163, 165 to move<br>
in and out and thereby adjust the height of riser 157.<br>
An alternative embodiment of an adjustable riser is shown in Figures 27 and<br>
28. Riser 181 is shown in a scale assembly like assembly 81, which is described<br>
above. Riser 181 may be configured to be a direct replacement for riser 83. To<br>
provide for height adjustability of riser 181, two eccentric lobes 183, 185 are installed<br>
within an upper portion of riser 181. Lobe 183, which is constructed similarly to lobe<br>
185, is shown in detail in Figure 28. Lobes 183, 185 comprise eccentric portion 187<br>
and drive member 189. Drive member 189 rotates about its longitudinal axis and is<br>
installed in an off-center position within eccentric portion 187. Eccentric portion 187<br>
rotates with drive member 189, and the result is that eccentric portion "wobbles" as<br>
drive member rotates the assembly. The eccentric motion causes scale 15, which<br>
rests on lobes 183, 185, to move up and down with the motion of lobes 183,185,<br>
allowing a user to selectively adjust the height of scale 15.<br>
The present invention provides for several advantages, including: (1)<br>
providing apparatus that allows the user to simultaneously level and weigh an<br>
aircraft; (2) providing mobile apparatus to eliminate the need for a dedicated site;<br>
and (3) providing improved methods for leveling and weighing an aircraft.<br>
 <br>
While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative<br>
embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense.<br>
Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments, as well as<br>
other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art<br>
upon reference to the description.<br>
