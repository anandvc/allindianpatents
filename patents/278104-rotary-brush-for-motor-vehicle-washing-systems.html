				<td>BACKGROUND OF THK INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rotary brush specifically designed for motor vehicle washing systems.<br>
As is known, automatic motor vehicle washing systems conventionally comprise washing brush elements.<br>
Prior rotary brush elements general-ly comprise a support, of cylindric configuration, and coupiled to a rotary member.<br>
On the outer surface of the support element are applied a plurality of flexible cleaning elements, adjoining one another and coupling, at an end portion, to said support element, orthogonally thereto.<br>
The automatic cleaning and washing of the motor vehicle body are achieved by causing a plurality of brushes of the above disclosed type to properly rotate, to cause their flexible elements, held in a preset configuration under the effect of the centrifugal force generated by the rotary brushes, to impact the motor vehicle body, through the interposition of water and/or suitable washing solutions or emulsions.<br>
The above mentioned prior cleaning elements, in particular, are at present made of a polyethylene material, in the form of wires, or they comprise felt materials, in the form of strips or bands.<br>
In the first case, the free end portion of each brush forming wire is crushed, with a specifically designed method called "feathering"', to increase the width of each said wire, to distribute its impact pressure  on a  larger  surface,  while  increasing  the:<br>
 <br>
cleaning surface.<br>
On this end portion which, after the above mentioned treatment, as a set rough and porosity, minute particles, either of stone or metal nature, are deposited, said particles being collected from the previously cleaned surfaces.<br>
The removed particles enter the mentioned rough and porous parts, to be crusted therein, thereby forming abrading regions which can scratch the paint of the motor vehicle being washed, and generate minute scorings thereon.<br>
This same drawback also occurs, in a further enhanced manner, if felt elements are used, which felt material, of spongy nature, is susceptible easily embed the abrading particles therein.<br>
Moreover, with felt cleaning elements, since the felt materials have a great liquid absorption properties, a further drawback occurs that, at a temperature near to zero, and because of a cooling effect caused by the evaporation generated by the washing brush movement, the elements tend to fully or partially freeze, thereby stiffening and preventing the washing system from properly operating.<br>
The washing brush elements made of band elements, comprise a plurality of strips or strings, which are formed by partially cutting through the band elements .<br>
Said strips are arranged perpendicularly to the axis of the entraining shaft, thereby said bands are restrained.<br>
This constructional solution generates a series of problems.<br>
In fact, to provide a suitable cleaning surface,<br>
 <br>
it is necessary to perform the assembling of sectors or bristles supporting strips with a close arrangement, to prevent an uneven, washing action from occurring.<br>
In prior washing brushes, if the bristle supporting sectors or strips are spaced, in the spaced surface portions, the brush bristles will have gaps negatively affecting the cleaning of some regions of the motor vehicle body.<br>
Moreover, if conventional band elements are arranged at a close spacing from one another, they provide undesired bridgings or overlappings of the strips, with a consequent possibility of an early wear of adjoining band strips.<br>
Moreover, to provide even washing characteristics, it is necessary to mount on the. supporting shaft a plurality of band supporting sectors or ' strips arranged in a close relationship and, to that end, it is necessary to use a supporting shaft of ■;.. suitable size to mechanically resist against the stress induced by the mentioned band elements.<br>
Thus, because of the above mentioned over-sizing, the washing brushes will have a comparative;!;/ large weight, with a large increase of the consumed power, a greater wear of the rotary members and, accordingly, an increasing of the washing system faults.<br>
Moreover, prior rotary brushes, including ,1 plurality of close arranged bands', can damage the motor vehicle antenna and rear windows.<br>
To the above it is to be added that the above mentioned band elements are frequently made of a foamed material and are affixed to the supporting shaft b/ several types of connecting means such as rivets, smalt<br>
 <br>
bars and so on.<br>
For technical reasons, the number of said band elements can vary from a minimum number to a number which is from one to three times larger and, as stated, the arrangement of the side surface of the shaft can be either too close or too spaced apart.<br>
Then, as the thus designed washing brush is rotatively driven, the distribution of the strings cut through the band elements will mirror the arrangement of the said band elements on the inner cylinder.<br>
All the tradeoffs related to a lacking of space on the surface of the tube or supporting shaft are reflected mirror-like on the side surface of the thus formed cylindric brush.<br>
However, as in regions of the washing brush is provided to use a minimum amount of band elements, the latter, which are affixed by conventional insert members, cannot be arranged with a rational arrangement on the washing cylinder. The documents US6279190, US623741,US5819357, DE 20312415 and UCO 2004/052703 all discloses substantially the preamble of claims 1.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is to provide such a rotary brush for motor vehicle washing systems overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Within the scope of the above mention aim, a main object of the invention is to provide such a washing rotary brush to which the above mentioned string or band elements can be easily affixed and with a large mechanical strength.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such a washing rotary brush allowing to better exploit the cleaning strings, with respect to the intensity and covering of the washing operation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a washing rotary brush which has a variable geometry, depending on the brush diameter to be achieved.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as well as yet other objects, which will become more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a washing rotary brush for motor vehicle washing systems, according for claims 1.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, the fixed - joint coupling means comprise a plurality of slots which are helically arranged on the central support element.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to the number references of the above mentioned figures, the washing rotary brush according to the invention, which has been generally indicated by the reference number 1, comprises a plurality of band elements, each indicated by the reference number 2, which can be coupled to a central support 3, through coupling means 4.<br>
More specifically, each said band element 2 comprises a plate-like body 5 which can be advantageously made of a closed cell foamed plastic materials or a felt material.<br>
Said plate-like body 5 has a configuration which is substantially elongated along a band element longitudinal axis and, on said plate-like body 5 a plurality of cuts 6 are formed, so as to provide a plurality of parallel strips 7.<br>
A main feature of the invention is that the plate-like body 5 can be folded through 180° about its longitudinal axis to define two sectors which are thereby overlapped onto one another.<br>
The end portions of said plate-like body can be inclined or slanted with a set slanting angle, thereby causing said sectors, as it is clearly shown in figures 7 to 9, to define a plurality of strips 7 which have respectively counter-directed inclinations.<br>
Thus, the provision of the above disclosed brushes 1 allows to provide,  the number of the band<br>
 <br>
elements 2 being smaller, the same washing characteristics, since the mutual inclination or slanting of the strips 7 will provide an increase of the useful washing height thereof.<br>
In other words, if a conventional band element 2, of straight-line configuration, has a flat width cf 15 cm, as it is folded with respect to its middle longitudinal direction, it will be able of washing a strip having a surface of about 8-9 cm.<br>
For the above disclosed band element 2, the starting width being the same, as it is folded through 18 0° along a longitudinal direction, because of the mutual inclination, strips 7 will be provided which are adapted to wash through a region having a width from 15 to 20 cm.<br>
Thus, the increase of the useful working or washing surface will allow to use a less number of band elements 2, the washing shaft length being the same, to provide smaller weight brush assemblies, with a consequent power saving, thereby improving the washing evenness, due to the elimination of gaps between adjoining band elements.<br>
After having folded through 180° the band element 2, said band element is further folded about its middle cross axis to be coupled to the central support element 3.<br>
Thus, an assembly is provided, adapted to operate in a more delicate manner on the surfaces to be washed, thereby reducing vibrations and assuring a longer duration of the bearings supporting the washing elements.<br>
It is possible to fold the band element 2 about the middle cross axis, in an asymmetrical manner with<br>
 <br>
respect to the center, thereby providing a plurality of strip elements 7 having a differentiated length.<br>
The connection of the band element 2 to the central support element 3 is performed, according to the present invention, by specifically designed couplimg means 4 including an attachment or clamping bar element 8 which is bayonet-like engaged in one of the slots 9 formed along the directrix lines of the central support element 3.<br>
After the engagement, the end portion of the bar element 8 will closely and safely contact the central support element 3, thereby making a safety weldment thereof possible.<br>
In this connection, it should be pointed out that the coupling means according to the present invention allow to provide the connection without the need of using specifically designed coupling cools, while allowing the physical effort to be reduced to a minimum as necessary.<br>
The bar element 8 is designed for holding the band element 2 clamped to the cylinder 3.<br>
As shown, said bar element 8 comprises an enlarged end portion 10, the other end portion of said bar element including a tooth element 11.<br>
The enlarged end portion 10 is engaged in suitable recesses 12, formed in an adjoining relationship with each slot 9 on the support element 3, whereas the tooth 11 can be engaged in a hole 13 formec at the other end portion of each said slot 9.<br>
The tooth 11 is snap engaged herein on ar. annular rim 14 encompassing the support element 3.<br>
The width of the bar element 8 is so designed as to provide a plurality of equally spaced slots 9.<br>
 <br>
Figures 19 and 20 show two further embodiments of the washing rotary brush according to the present invention.<br>
With reference to the number references of figure 19, the washing rotary brush according to the invention, generally indicated by the reference number 101, comprises a plurality of band elements, each identified by the reference number 2, said band elements being adapted to be coupled to a central support element 103 through coupling means 104.<br>
In particular, the coupling of the band element 2 to the central support 103 is performed, according to the embodiment shown in figure 19, by coupling means 104 comprising a clamping bar element 108 adapted to be engaged, in a bayonet-like manner, in one of the slots 10 9, helically arranged on the surface of the central support element 103.<br>
After having performed This engagement, the end portion of the bar element 108 will closely and safely contact the support element 103, thereby allowing to perform a safety welding operation.<br>
The coupling means according to the present invention permit to perform the coupling without the need of using specifically designed tools, and allow tc reduce the physical effort to a minimum, as necessary.<br>
The bar element 108 is provided for holding the band element 2 clamped to the cylinder 103.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 19, the bar elements 108 are substantially rectilinear, as well as the corresponding slots 109.<br>
Thus, the bar element 108 cannot slip en the band element to be clamped, thereby preventing overheating  phenomenon  from  occurring,  which  woulc<br>
reduce the production yield.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 20, the central support element, generally indicated by the reference number 203, comprises helical slots 209 which can be engaged by respective bar elements, not shown, suitably curved so as to prevent any rubbing movement on the respective band element inside the slots 209.<br>
In both the above disclosed embodiments, the width of the bar element 108 is so designed as to provide a plurality of equispace;d slots.<br>
The coupling system according to the present invention provides a lot of different advantages.<br>
The system can be handled in a much more easy manner.<br>
In fact, any manual operations for obtaining z-set position arrangement is greatly reduced, since the operation of clamping or locking the cleaning element is achieved by a slight or small bayonet sliding (of few millimeters) which can be obtained by a iov pressing.<br>
The system is moreover much more reliable.<br>
In fact, upon performing the coupling, the foot, portion  of  the  bar  element  will  be  engaged  in throughgoing  manner  and  the  head  will  in  turn  b
Differently from prior systems, the coupling means according to the present invention do not allow any rotary or unthreading movement, both in thi assembling operation and in the use proper.<br>
The subject system, furthermore, allows t :&gt; perform very quick and easy welding operations, owing to the projecting end portions contacting the supporc body.<br>
Moreover, the coupling system according to the present invention can be used in a lot of different applications, for example with foamed materials or felr materials or the like.<br>
It has been found that the invention fully achieves the inte:nded aim and objects.<br>
In fact, the invention provides a washing brush having a better distribution of the washing strings or elements, which, after having folded the band element to a slanted arrangement, will be arranged not in parallel to one another but. so as to form a doctor blade proper toward the surface to be contacted.<br>
This provides a better exploiting of the' cleaning strings 7 which, if they would be arrangec perpendicular to the rotary axis, and accordingly parallel to one another, would tend to "perfectly conceal" one beyond the other, thereby providing an unsatisfactory intensity washing operation (the sc called "domino" effect).<br>
The system according to the present invention, moreover, affords the possibility of performing a full closure or filling-in of the spaces left empty by the parallel arrangement which, otherwise, would involve the generation of a plurality of not touched regions.<br>
Moreover, the system according to the present invention allows to perform a much easier assembling while providing good strength characteristics and i long time duration.<br>
Such an optimized distribution will make the washing brush very homogeneous, thereby improving its washing efficiency.<br>
Moreover, the system allows to provide ;a variable type of geometry,  depending on the washing<br>
brush diameter to be achieved.<br>
Moreover, the washing brush according to the present invention allows to optimize the operation results, by changing the slanting or inclination of the strings, by few degrees either upward or downward, and this depending on the diameter of the subject washing brush.<br>
Moreover, the inclination of the cuts 6 of the strings 7 defines the distance of the merging point of the end portions.<br>
To a larger inclination of the cut will correspond a nearer merging or meeting point.<br>
Moreover, the system according to the. present invention allows to greatly increase the washing force, since the band elements 2 will touch as a doctor blade the surface to be washed.<br>
In other words, since a band element 2 can be spread apart up to nearly double the space of its base, its washing force will be greatly improved.<br>
Moreover, the inclination of the cuts 6 of the strings 7 allows said strings to be better peripherally arranged and allows the strings to better perform.<br>
The amount of band elements 2 being the same, the subject washing brush 1 will be accordingly much more efficient with respect to a washing brusf including parallel and perpendicular band elements.<br>
By assembling the sectors starting from eithei one or the other end portions with diagonal banci elements 2 facing the center, it is possible to obtain a vehicle encompassing effect, thereby great1" improving the washing efficiency at the end contact edges.<br>
In this  connection,  it should be furthermore<br>
pointed out that the invention provides to use a specifically cut band element arrangement, to leave an empty region inside the washing brush, like a pouch as is shown in figures 5 and 6; thus, two washing-cylinders mounted with an opposite relationship, would be able of properly washing a projecting element, while allowing it to pass through with an arch-like arrangement, such as a rear mirror or a TAXI sign.<br>
In fact, the end portions of the band element 2 will be able of properly contacting the regions near the rear mirror, thereby causing the rear mirror to be encompassed by the mentioned pouch.<br>
This will greatly reduce friction of the projecting object, by the washing brush, as the latter is displaced toward the vehicle to provide its washinc; action and, accordingly, the subject washing brush can also be used on a central portion of a horizontal, surface, for example for preventing any damaging to TAXI signs or police car blinking lamps as well as rear pulling hook assemblies.<br>
A further advantage is that the rotary direction of the vertical washing brush is changed near a rear window to prevent the rear window from being folded down.<br>
In this connection, it should be moreovec pointed out that the clamping bar elements 8, 108, engaged with a bayonet-like engagement arrangement i.i one of the slots 9, 109 formed in the central body 3 of the rotary brush 1, have respective end portions 11 provided for being hot swaged.<br>
In other words, after having located a bar-element 8, operating as a locking element for the band 2,. in its recess or housing, the tooth 11' provided at.<br>
one end portion 11 of a said bar element 8 will be arranged under the bridge 13 holding it in a locked condition.<br>
By a suitable instrument, calibrated at a set temperature, the projecting end portion 11 of said bar element 8 is so deformed as to cause said bar element 8 to assume, at its end portion 11, the shape of a nail head 11' .<br>
As stated, the end portion 11 of the bar element 8, 108 can be either swaged or it can be molten with the central crown 3 holding the assembly.<br>
The bar element 108 can be welded to the ce n L.ral body 3, 103 of the brush not only at its end portion 11 but also at other portions of the central support 3, tc hold said band element 2 in its engagement slots 9.<br>
It is also possible to restrain the banc elements 2 to the central body 3, 103 by a welding operation of a second body, so as to form a sandwich construction, if the used central shaft is constitutec by a plastics material tube.<br>
In this connection, it should be moreover pointed out that the invention also provides to use, for foamed material cleaning band elements 2, or felt band elements, conventional polyethylene threads, which can be applied and restrained to the central body 3 oi the rotary brush 1 by using the same bar elements a;; those used for clamping or locking the band element 2.<br>
In practicing the invention, the used materials, as well as the contingent size and shapes, can be any, depending on requirements.<br>
