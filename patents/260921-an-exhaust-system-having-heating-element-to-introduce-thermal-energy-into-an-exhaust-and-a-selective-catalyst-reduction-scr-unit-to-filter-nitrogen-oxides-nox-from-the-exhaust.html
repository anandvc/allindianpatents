SCR COLD START HEATING SYSTEM FOR A DIESEL EXHAUST<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to exhaust systems, and more<br>
particularly to emission reduction techniques associated therewith.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the<br>
purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the<br>
presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background<br>
section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as<br>
prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as<br>
prior art against the present disclosure.<br>
[0003] Exhaust systems for automobiles are used to filter and<br>
reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Several technologies have<br>
been developed to decrease NOx emissions. The technologies include<br>
passive methods that use catalysts and active methods, such as<br>
electrochemical catalysis and photocatalytical, plasma, and laser techniques.<br>
For example, rich-burning engines use a three-way catalyst to reduce NOx<br>
emissions. The three-way catalyst typically includes a combination of noble<br>
metals deposited on a stabilized alumina carrier. The three-way catalyst<br>
works with a feedback system that directs an engine to blend air and fuel in<br>
stoichiometric proportions. By controlling an air-to-fuel ratio of the engine,<br>
hydrocarbons (HCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) are produced to convert NOx<br>
and HCs to carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen gas, and/or nitrogen gas.<br>
[0004] The NOx reducing performance of the three-way catalyst,<br>
which is the standard NOx abatement technology for gasoline engines,<br>
deteriorates rapidly in the presence of oxygen. Thus, this technology is<br>
ineffective in controlling NOx emissions in lean exhaust gases. Approaches<br>
that control NOx emissions in lean-burn engines, i.e., engines such as diesel<br><br>
2<br>
engines that burn fuel in excess oxygen, include catalytic decomposition of<br>
nitrogen monoxide (NO) units and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units.<br>
[0005] The decomposition of NOx in a diesel exhaust requires high<br>
activation energy and thus is inhibited. Therefore, a catalyst is necessary to<br>
lower this activation energy in order to facilitate the decomposition. Various<br>
catalysts have been used to decompose NOx, including precious metals,<br>
metallic oxides, zeolites-based catalysts and copper ion-exchanged zeolite.<br>
[0006] Although the use of a catalyst aids in the reduction of the<br>
activation energy, present diesel engines at startup and when moderately<br>
operated tend to exhibit cool exhaust temperatures. This delays effectiveness<br>
of an SCR unit. An SCR unit needs to reach a minimum operating<br>
temperature to effectively filter NOx. Typically, an SCR unit does not<br>
efficiently clean an exhaust until several minutes after an engine is started.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, an exhaust system is provided that includes a<br>
heating element that is disposed downstream from an engine and that<br>
introduces thermal energy into an exhaust of the engine. A selective catalyst<br>
reduction (SCR) unit is disposed downstream from the heating element and<br>
filters nitrogen oxides (NOx) within the exhaust. A control module is in<br>
communication with and energizes the heating element based on temperature<br>
of the SCR unit.<br>
[0008] In other features, a diesel exhaust system is provided and<br>
includes a heating element that is disposed downstream from a diesel engine<br>
and that introduces thermal energy into an exhaust of the diesel engine. A<br>
diesel oxidation catalyst is disposed downstream from the heating element<br>
and removes at least one of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide from the<br>
exhaust. A selective catalyst reduction (SCR) unit is disposed downstream<br>
from the diesel oxidation catalyst and filters nitrogen oxides (NOx) within the<br>
exhaust. A control module is in communication with and energizes the<br>
heating element based on temperature of the SCR unit.<br><br>
3<br>
[0009] In still other features, a method of operating an exhaust<br>
system is provided and includes generating an engine startup signal. An<br>
electrically heated catalyst (EHC), which is disposed downstream from a<br>
diesel engine and that introduces thermal energy into an exhaust of the diesel<br>
engine, is energized based on the engine startup signal. Nitrogen oxides<br>
(NOx) within the exhaust system are filtered via a selective catalyst reduction<br>
(SCR) unit that is disposed downstream from the EHC.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or<br>
more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As used<br>
herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a<br>
logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood<br>
that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering<br>
the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0017] Referring to FIGs. 1-2, functional block diagrams of portions<br>
of an exemplary diesel engine system 10 of a vehicle 11 including a selective<br>
catalyst reduction (SCR) heating system 12 is shown. It is appreciated that<br>
the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and that the SCR<br>
heating system 12 described herein may be implemented in various engine<br>
systems that have a SCR unit. Such engine systems may include, but are not<br>
limited to, gasoline direct injection engine systems and homogeneous charge<br>
compression ignition engine systems.<br>
[0018] The engine system 10 includes a diesel engine 14, an air<br>
intake system 16, a fuel injection system 18, a glow plug system 20 (or<br>
ignition system when applied to a gasoline spark ignition engine), and an<br>
exhaust system 22. In a simplified embodiment, the SCR heating system 12<br>
includes a control module 24, an SCR unit 26, and an electrically heated<br>
catalyst (EHC) 28. The EHC 28 is disposed upstream from the SCR unit 26.<br>
In more involved embodiments, the SCR heating system 12 may include the<br>
air intake system 16, the fuel injection system 18, the glow plug system 20,<br>
the exhaust system 22, and related elements, components and systems<br>
thereof.<br><br>
5<br>
[0019] The SCR heating system 12 heats the SCR unit 26 early in<br>
an engine startup process. This allows temperature of the SCR unit 26 to<br>
increase to an active operating temperature earlier in federal test procedure<br>
(FTP) cycles, which in turn reduces exhaust emissions. Traditional diesel<br>
engines startup and operate with cool exhaust temperatures. From initial<br>
startup until a time at which catalyst aftertreatment systems reach an active<br>
operating temperature, traditional exhaust systems are inefficient in<br>
preventing exhaust emissions. The time frame between startup and the point<br>
in time at which the exhaust system reaches efficient active operation can be<br>
several minutes. When operating at temperatures below the active operating<br>
temperature, which for some SCR units is approximately 200°C, untreated<br>
exhaust can be emitted. The embodiments disclosed and described herein<br>
increase the temperature of the aftertreatment systems quickly and early on in<br>
an engine startup to significantly reduce exhaust emissions.<br>
[0020] The engine 14 combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive<br>
torque. The engine 14 includes eight cylinders 40 configured in adjacent<br>
cylinder banks 42, 44 in V-type layout. Although Figure 1 depicts eight<br>
cylinders (N = 8), it can be appreciated that the engine 14 may include<br>
additional or fewer cylinders. For example, engines that have 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,<br>
12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. It is also anticipated that the SCR<br>
heating system 12 may be implemented and associated with in an inline-type<br>
or another type of cylinder configuration.<br>
[0021] The air intake system 16 may include a throttle plate 46<br>
and/or other air flow controlling devices 48. The throttle plate 46 may be<br>
located proximate to or in an intake manifold 50. The intake manifold 50 is<br>
mounted on the engine 14.<br>
[0022] The fuel injection system 18 may be in the form of a common<br>
rail fuel injection system, as shown. The fuel injection system 18 includes fuel<br>
injectors 52. Each fuel injector 52 is associated with one of the cylinders 40.<br>
The fuel system 18 provides fuel to engine 14, which may be mixed with air<br>
and ignited via compression and heat and/or by the glow plug system 20.<br><br>
6<br>
Ignition of the air/fuel mixture provides power for the engine 14 to propel the<br>
vehicle 11.<br>
[0023] The glow plug system 20 includes glow plugs 60 (or spark<br>
plugs when applied to a gasoline spark ignition engine). Glow plugs 60 may<br>
be used on a diesel engine to initiate an ignition processes during startup.<br>
The purpose of the glow plug system 20 is to pre-heat the cylinders 40 or to<br>
pre-heat combustion pre-chambers in an indirect injection engine for easier<br>
starting when the engine 14 is cold.<br>
[0024] A switch 62 starts the operation of control module 24. The<br>
switch 62 may be an ignition switch, a manually controlled switch, a control<br>
switch, a solid-state switch, a switch within the control module 24, or some<br>
other switch. The control module 24 cranks the engine 14 by signaling a<br>
starter 64 to turn a flywheel 66, which cranks a crankshaft 68. The crankshaft<br>
68 operates a timing chain 70, which turns camshafts 72. The control module<br>
24 synchronizes the SCR heating system 12, the engine 14, the air intake<br>
system 16, the fuel system 18 and the glow plug system 20. The control<br>
module 24 may use timing sensors 80, such as crankshaft position and<br>
camshaft position sensors 82 to determine locations of pistons 84 within each<br>
of the cylinders 40, as well as to determine ignition stroke timing and other<br>
timing parameters. The positions of the crankshaft 68 and camshafts 72 may<br>
determine the position of each piston 84 in each of the cylinders 40. In<br>
general, the position of the camshafts 72 determines whether the pistons 84,<br>
in each of the cylinders 40, are on an intake or a compression stroke.<br>
[0025] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 50 across the throttle<br>
plate 46. Air is drawn into the cylinders 40 from the intake manifold 50 and is<br>
compressed therein. Fuel is injected into cylinders 40 by the fuel injection<br>
system 18 and thermal energy (heat) of the compressed air and/or from the<br>
glow plug system 20 ignites the air/fuel mixture. Exhaust gases are<br>
exhausted from the cylinders 40 into the exhaust system 22. In some<br>
instances, the engine system 10 can include a turbocharger 88 that uses an<br>
exhaust driven turbine 90 to drive a compressor 92 that compresses the air<br><br>
7<br>
entering the intake manifold 50. The compressed air typically passes through<br>
an air cooler before entering into the intake manifold 50.<br>
[0026] In a 4-stroke cycle engine, as illustrated for an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, each piston 84 has four strokes: an intake stroke, a<br>
compression stroke, an expansion or power stroke, and an exhaust stroke.<br>
The positions of the crankshaft 68 and camshafts 72 allow the control module<br>
24 to determine when a piston is beginning an intake stroke or ending a<br>
compression stroke. When a piston is near the beginning of an intake stroke<br>
the control module 24 signals the fuel injectors 52 to operate. The fuel<br>
injectors 52 inject fuel into the intake manifold 50, which is followed by the<br>
engine cylinders 40. Although the fuel is described as being injected into the<br>
intake manifold 50, it may also be directly injected into the cylinders 40.<br>
When ending a compression stroke heat within the cylinders 40 ignites the<br>
air/fuel mixture, which was allowed to enter the engine cylinder during the<br>
intake stroke, to create a power stroke to drive the crankshaft 68. After the<br>
fuel has been ignited in an engine cylinder, resulting exhaust is released on<br>
the exhaust stroke through exhaust system 22.<br>
[0027] The exhaust system 22 includes exhaust manifolds 100, 102,<br>
exhaust conduits 96, 104, 106 and the SCR heating system 12, which for the<br>
embodiment shown may be referred to as or included as part of a diesel<br>
exhaust filtering system. The exhaust manifolds 100, 102 direct the exhaust<br>
exiting the corresponding cylinder banks 40, 44 into the exhaust conduits 96,<br>
104, 106. Optionally, an EGR valve 110 may recirculate a portion of the<br>
exhaust back into the intake manifold 50. The remainder of the exhaust is<br>
directed into the turbocharger 88 to drive the turbine 90. The turbine 90<br>
facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the intake manifold<br>
50. A combined exhaust stream flows from the turbocharger 88 through the<br>
exhaust conduit 96.<br><br>
8<br>
[0028] The filtering system 12 includes the SCR unit 26, the EHC<br>
28, a mixer 120, a diesel oxidizing catalyst (DOC) 122, and a gaseous or<br>
liquid reductant injector system 124. The mixer 120 is disposed upstream<br>
from the SCR unit 26. The DOC 122 is disposed upstream from the mixer<br>
120. The EHC 28 is disposed upstream from the DOC 122. The positional<br>
order shown of the SCR unit 26, the EHC 28, the mixer 120, and the DOC<br>
122 is for example purposes only, other arrangements may be implemented.<br>
For the example shown, the SCR unit 26 and the mixer 120 are part of and<br>
packaged within a first canister 128. The EHC 28 and DOC 122 are part of<br>
and packaged within a second canister 130. The second canister 130 is<br>
disposed upstream from the first canister 128 and is coupled between the<br>
turbine 90 and the first canister 128.<br>
[0029] The DOC 122 may have a core substrate with multiple layers<br>
including one or more catalyst layers and a washcoat layer, which increases<br>
surface area of the core substrate. The core substrate may be formed of a<br>
honeycomb of ceramic or stainless steel and coated with one or more<br>
precious metals. Examples of precious metals are platinum, palladium,<br>
rhodium, cerium, iron, manganese, nickel, and copper. The washcoat may<br>
include silicon or aluminum.<br>
[0030] The reductant injector system 124 includes a reagent tank<br>
140, a filter 142, and a pump 144. The reagent tank 140 holds a reagent,<br>
such as ammonia or urea, which is filtered and pumped into the exhaust<br>
upstream from the SCR unit 26 via a reagent injector 146. The reagent mixes<br>
with the exhaust gas and decomposes prior to passing through at least one<br>
exhaust catalyst bed in the SCR unit 26. Once in the exhaust the reagent<br>
vaporizes, mixes with oxides of nitrogen and passes over a catalyst, which<br>
turns ozone-forming oxides on nitrogen (NOx) into water, nitrogen and carbon<br>
dioxide CO2. The exhaust gas may be mixed by means of the mixer prior to<br>
passing through to the SCR catalyst beds. There may be multiple catalyst<br>
layers within the first canister 128 to ensure adequate NOx conversion. The<br>
SCR catalyst beds may be based on titanium oxide with additions of metal<br><br>
9<br>
oxides such as, for example, vanadium, molybdenum, tungsten oxide, and/or<br>
zeolite, which reacts with the ammonia and NOx to form environmentally<br>
harmless nitrogen, oxygen, and water. The SCR catalyst beds may<br>
alternatively be based on other materials as is commonly known in the art.<br>
[0031] The control module 24 regulates operation of the diesel<br>
engine system 10 including management of the SCR heating system 12, the<br>
air intake system 16, the fuel injection system 18, the glow plug system 20<br>
and the exhaust system 22. For this reason, the control module 24 is<br>
considered part of each of the systems 16, 18, 20, 22. The control module 24<br>
manages the diesel engine system 10 to quickly and efficiently increase the<br>
temperatures of the exhaust system 22, including temperatures of the DOC<br>
122 and the SCR unit 26, upon engine startup. In one embodiment, the<br>
control module 24 supplies current to the EHC 28 upon engine startup. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, the control module 24 supplies<br>
current to the EHC 28 prior to engine startup. The control module 24 may<br>
predict, estimate, and/or determine that a startup procedure is to begin in the<br>
near future, such as in approximately 1-3 minutes. When it is determined that<br>
a startup procedure is to occur, the control module 24 may preheat the EHC<br>
28, thereby allowing for the SCR unit 26 and the DOC 122 to more quickly<br>
increase in temperature upon startup.<br>
[0032] Current to the EHC 28 is controlled and provided via the<br>
control module 24, switches 148 and a power source 150 to begin a heating<br>
process. The current from the power source 150 may be supplied directly to<br>
the EHC 28, as shown, or supplied to the control module 24 prior to being<br>
received by the EHC 28. The duration of the heating process varies. It is<br>
anticipated, that the heating process can last between 1-4 minutes. More<br>
specifically, electric energy heats the EHC 28 for a threshold period (e.g., 1-3<br>
minutes). Exhaust passing through the EHC 28 is heated.<br>
[0033] Referring now also to FIG. 3 in which a thermal flow diagram<br>
of an exothermic reaction is shown. The thermal flow diagram illustrates an<br>
EHC exhaust energy leveraging technique. The EHC 28 performs as a low<br><br>
10<br>
mass catalyzed heating element and igniter. The EHC 28 heats and/or ignites<br>
exhaust, represented by arrow 160, which is passed into the DOC 122. The<br>
exhaust 160 includes combustion products, such as hydrogen (H2),<br>
hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (02). Electrical<br>
energy in the form of current, represented by arrow 162, is provided to the<br>
EHC 28. The current 162 increases the temperature of the EHC 28, which<br>
increases thermal energy of the exhaust 160 to generate a first activation<br>
energy q1 exotherm and a second activation energy q2 that is electric based.<br>
The first activation energy q1 exotherm represents the exothermic energy of<br>
the exhaust products.<br>
The first activation energy q1 and the second activation energy q2 are<br>
represented by arrows 164 and 166. The DOC 122 performs as a catalytic<br>
combustor.<br>
[0034] The first activation energy q1 and the second activation<br>
energy q2 are provided to and activate the DOC 122, which provides a large<br>
thermal output, which is represented by a third activation energy q3 exotherm<br>
arrow 168. Thermal energy out of the DOC 122 is significantly larger than<br>
that out of the EHC 28. The large thermal output quickly increases<br>
temperature of the SCR unit 26. The above thermal reaction may be referred<br>
to as a fast converter light off, which provides low cold start emissions. In<br>
other words, emission output is decreased due to quick and efficient increase<br>
in DOC and SCR unit temperatures.<br>
[0035] As an example, the temperature of the EHC 28 may be equal<br>
to a start temperature S, of the exhaust plus the energy E, added to the EHC<br>
28 divided by the exhaust mass Em minus heat loss H,, as provided by<br>
equation 1.<br><br>
[0036] The energy added to the EHC E, divided by the exhaust<br>
mass £ equals the voltage V across terminals of the EHC 28 multiple by the<br><br>
11<br>
current C supplied to the EHC 28 and the amount of time that current is<br>
supplied to the EHC 28, divided by the mass EHCm of the EHC, as shown by<br>
equation 2.<br><br>
[0037] Since the mass EHCm and electrical resistance of the EHC<br>
28 are constant the energy added E, divided by the exhaust mass Em may be<br>
set equal to a first constant AT, multiplied by the square of the voltage<br>
V multiplied by time T, as provided in equation 3.<br><br>
[0038] Heat loss may be set equal to a second constant K2<br>
multiplied by exhaust flow Ef multiplied by the start temperature S,, as<br>
provided in equation 4. The exhaust flow Ef is measured in flow units per unit<br>
time.<br><br>
[0039] The control module 24 may have a central processing unit,<br>
memory (RAM and/or ROM), and associated input and output buses or be of<br>
some other module form. The control module 24 may be a portion of a<br>
central vehicle main control unit, an interactive vehicle dynamics module, a<br>
power control module, an ignition controller, a control circuit having a power<br>
supply, combined into a single integrated controller, or may be a stand-alone<br>
controller as shown.<br>
[0040] The diesel engine system 10 may include various sensors<br>
170, which may be part of or shared by the SCR heating system 12, the air<br>
intake system 16, the fuel injection system 18, the glow plug system 20, the<br>
exhaust system 20 or other vehicle systems. The sensors 170 may include<br>
the timing sensors 80, as well as intake and exhaust sensors 172, air and fuel<br>
sensors 174, and other vehicle sensors.<br><br>
12<br>
[0041] The intake and exhaust sensors 172 may include<br>
temperature sensors 180, such as an EHC temperature sensor 182 and an<br>
SCR temperature sensor 184. The intake and exhaust sensors 172 may also<br>
include an EHC current sensor 186, pressure sensors 188, flow sensors 190,<br>
oxygen sensors 192, NOx sensors 194, and other exhaust sensors. The air<br>
and fuel sensors 174 may include air and fuel pressure sensors 196, air and<br>
fuel flow sensors 198 and other air and fuel sensors. The timing sensors 80,<br>
in addition to the crankshaft and camshaft sensors 82, may include a<br>
transmission sensor, a drivetrain sensor, or some other timing sensor. The<br>
sensors 170 may be used for status determination and control of the diesel<br>
engine system 10. The control module 24 determines when exhaust heating<br>
is to be performed and controls engine operation to facilitate efficient heating<br>
based on information received from the sensors 170.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Figure 4, a flow chart illustrating a method<br>
of operating an exhaust system is shown. A control routine used to manage<br>
performance of the described method may be executed by the control module<br>
of FIGs. 1-2. Although the following steps are primarily described with respect<br>
to the embodiments of FIGs. 1 and 2, they may be easily applied to and/or<br>
modified for other embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0043] In step 200, the EHC 28 may be preheated prior to engine<br>
startup. The control module 24 may receive an engine startup signal and<br>
based thereon activate the SCR heating system 12 and supply current to<br>
energize the EHC 24. The startup signal may be based on state of the switch<br>
62.<br>
[0044] In step 202, the engine 14 is started. Air-intake, fuel, and<br>
glow plug systems are initialized. The control module 24 determines the<br>
position of the crankshaft 68 and the camshafts 72 using the crankshaft and<br>
camshaft sensors 82. Ignition reference and injection reference engine<br>
cylinders are determined in response to the crankshaft and camshaft<br>
positions, respectively. The ignition reference engine cylinder is that in which<br>
a piston is nearing the end of a compression stroke. The injection reference<br><br>
13<br>
cylinder is that in which the piston is nearing the beginning of an intake stroke.<br>
Synchronization values, such as an ignition system synchronization value, a<br>
fuel system synchronization value, air flow synchronization values, and other<br>
synchronization values, may be determined. The synchronization values may<br>
be determined based on the positions of the crankshaft 68 and camshafts 72.<br>
[0045] In step 204, the SCR heating system 12 is activated when<br>
not previously activated, such as in step 200.<br>
[0046] In step 206, the control module 24 reduces and/or minimizes<br>
exhaust flow. An EHC start-up strategy algorithm may be enabled to reduce<br>
exhaust flow and improve heating performance of the EHC 28. To reduce<br>
exhaust flow, the control module 24 may generate lean fuel pulses prior to top<br>
dead center of the pistons 84. The control module 24 may also reduce air<br>
intake, via the air intake system 16. When an idle air control valve is utilized,<br>
position thereof may be adjusted. The revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the<br>
engine 14 may be reduced, which reduces exhaust flow and allows the EHC<br>
28 to heat up more quickly. The EHC 28 may be heated to approximately<br>
400-500°C.<br>
[0047] In step 208, the control module 24 receives or generates an<br>
EHC temperature signal. The EHC temperature signal may be generated<br>
directly by the EHC sensor 182 or generated indirectly. When generated<br>
indirectly, the EHC temperature signal may be estimated or determined based<br>
on temperature of the exhaust, flow of the exhaust, power supplied to the<br>
EHC 28, or other parameters.<br>
[0048] In step 210, when the EHC 28 reaches a predetermined<br>
temperature, the control module 24 proceeds to steps 212 and 214. The<br>
predetermined value is associated with a temperature at which exhaust<br>
product are consumed. In step 212, the control module 24 deenergizes the<br>
EHC 28.<br><br>
14<br>
[0049] In step 214, an exhaust exothermic energy control strategy is<br>
initiated to increase production output of exhaust products, such as<br>
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, of the engine 14. The air intake system<br>
16 and the fuel injection system 18 are adjusted to increase exhaust product<br>
output. For example, air intake and fuel injection may be increased. As<br>
another example, the fuel to air ratio may be increased to provide a rich intake<br>
pulse in the associate engine cycle, such as prior to top-dead-center of a<br>
piston cycle. Fuel may also be injected in an exhaust stroke to increase<br>
exhaust product output. The exhaust products generate an exothermic<br>
reaction when in contact with a heated element and/or a hot catalyst. This<br>
reaction generates a large amount of thermal energy that enables exhaust<br>
aftertreatment technologies to operate efficiently and sooner. The heated<br>
exhaust through the EHC 28 enables the DOC 122 and the SCR unit 26 to<br>
become fully active.<br>
[0050] In step 216, an SCR temperature signal is generated. The<br>
SCR temperature signal may be directly generated via the SCR temperature<br>
sensor or indirectly. The SCR temperature may also be indirectly estimated<br>
or determined based on temperature of the exhaust, flow of the exhaust,<br>
power supplied to the EHC 28, or other parameters. When the SCR unit 26<br>
reaches a second predetermined temperature, such as approximately 200°C,<br>
the SCR unit 26 is in an active state. When the temperature of the SCR unit<br>
26 is less than 200°C, the SCR unit 26 is in an inactive state or partially active<br>
state.<br>
[0051] In step 218, when the SCR unit 26 reaches the second<br>
predetermined temperature, the control module 24 proceeds to steps 220. In<br>
step 220, the exhaust product output may be decreased to provide a normal<br>
output for a current engine operating or driving condition. In step 222, when<br>
the SCR unit 26 reaches the second predetermined temperature, a gaseous<br>
and/or liquid reductant injection may be initiated into the exhaust via the<br>
reductant injector system 124.<br><br>
15<br>
[0052] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, or in a different order depending upon the application. Note<br>
that one or more of the above-steps may be repeated or performed during<br>
operation of the engine when temperature of the SCR unit 26 drops below or<br>
is below the second predetermined temperature. As such, the control module<br>
24 operates the SCR heating system 12 to maintain the SCR unit 26 at the<br>
second predetermined temperature. This maintains efficient and effective<br>
filtering of the exhaust system 22.<br>
[0053] The above-disclosed embodiments include integrated engine<br>
control and leverage exhaust energy to provide low tailpipe emissions during<br>
and upon startup of an engine.<br>
[0054] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes<br>
particular examples, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited<br>
since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon<br>
a study of the drawings, the specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
