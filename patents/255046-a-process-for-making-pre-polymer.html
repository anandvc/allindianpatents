DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this disclosure and the claims that follow, unless otherwise indicated, the term polyester is used in a broad sense and refers to a polymer containing more than 100 ester linkages (or more than 100 corresponding linkages in the case of derivatives of "straight" or "pure" polyesters such as polyetheresters, polyester amides and polyetherester amides). Similarly, polyester monomers would have 1 to 2 such linkages, polyester dimers 3 to 4 such linkages, polyester trimers 5 to 6 such linkages and polyester oligomers 7 to 100 such linkages. Pre-polyester refers to polyester monomers, dimers, trimers, oligomers and combinations of these.<br>
For simplicity, polyester processes will be understood to include processes for making pre-polyesters when used in this disclosure and the claims that follow, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
The processes according to the present invention include a process for making a pre-polyester comprising providing an esterification pipe reactor comprising a pipe, the pipe having an inlet and an outlet and constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows a path that is not totally vertical nor totally horizontal; and reacting one or more reactants flowing in the pipe towards the outlet under esterification reaction conditions to form the pre-polyester.<br>
More specifically, the pipe may be constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows an overall upward (outlet higher than inlet),<br>
but not totally vertical path; this path may be in addition generally non-downward, non-vertical. Further, the pipe may substantially empty; that is substantially free of mechanical or structural internals (reactants and the like not included of course). The pipe is understood to be hollow in the context of this disclosure and the claims that follow.<br>
For simplicity, esterification is taken to include, throughout this disclosure and the claims that follow, not only its common meaning, but ester exchange as well.<br>
The processes according to the present invention also include processes for making a polyester oligomer, a polyester or both comprising performing (the steps of) any of the processes for making a pre-polyester previously described and reacting t he p re-polyester a nd o ptionally o ther r eactants, u nder p olycondensation reaction conditions, to form the polyester oligomer, the polyester or both. This last mentioned step of reacting under polycondensation reaction conditions may be carried out in a polycondensation pipe reactor or other type of reactor for polycondensation.<br>
The reactions taking place as part of the processes according to the present invention ordinarily produce water (and perhaps other types of) vapor, which unless removed, may significantly reduce product yield. Thus, the processes of the present invention may further comprise removing vapor from inside the pipe.<br>
Given space limitation normally present at manufacturing sites, it may be convenient for the pipe to be serpentine; that is, having at least one bend. One preferred orientation for the pipe in accordance with this is shown in Fig. 1. The pipe 5 has several horizontal zones joined by bends.<br>
hi the reaction systems covered by the processes of the present invention, there may be solubility problems involving one or more reactants. For example, terephthalic acid is not very soluble in ethylene glycol, thus making it difficult to get the two to react in making polyethylene terephthalate. Thus, the processes of the present invention may further comprise adding a solubilizing agent into the pipe. For purposes here, a solubilizing agent makes one or more reactants more<br>
soluble in the other(s) or the reaction mixture generally; in this context (in reference to solubilizing agents), reactants will be taken as only those that are precursors for polyester monomers (as solubilizing agents are not such precursors). Suitable solubilizing agents include those comprising a polyester monomer, dimer and/or trimer; those comprising a polyester oligomer; those comprising a polyester; those comprising organic solvents such as chlorinated aromatics (like trichloro-benzene) and mixtures of phenol and chlorinated hydrocarbons (like tetrachloroethane), tetrahydrofuran or dimethyl sulfoxide; as well as those comprising c ombinations of these. Such agents comprising a polyester o ligomer, especially of the type being produced in the process, are often preferred. These agents may be mixed with reactants prior to addition to the pipe or added to the pipe separately in whole or in part. If mixed with reactants (here polyester monomer precursors) in any way, the solubilizing agent would be considered to be the mixture less any such reactants.<br>
Many different types of reactants or mixtures of reactants may be used in forming polyesters and pre-polyesters according to the processes of the present invention, the types or mixtures of reactants comprising a dicarboxylic acid (abbreviated here as a diacid), a diol, a diester, a hydroxy ester, a carboxylic acid ester (abbreviated here as an acid ester), a hydroxy carboxylic acid (abbreviated here as a hydroxy acid) or combinations thereof. It is possible that related materials such as tricarboxylic acids and other such multifunctional materials could also be employed. It should be understood that acid in this context would include corresponding mono, di or higher order salts. Of course, the pre-polyesters and polyesters being formed may be in turn reactants themselves.<br>
More specific reactants or mixtures of reactants of interest comprise aromatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 8 to 14 carbon atoms, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Such comprise terephthalic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, diphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic<br>
acid, dipheny-3,4'-dicarboxylic acid, 2,2,-dimethyl-l,3-propandiol, dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, mixtures thereof, and the like. The acid component can be fulfilled by the ester thereof, such as with dimethyl terephthalate.<br>
Further more specific reactants or mixtures of reactants comprise<br>
cycloaliphatic diols preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms or aliphatic diols<br>
preferably having 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Such comprise ethylene glycol (EG),<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol, propane-1,3-<br>

methylpentanediol-(2,4), 2-methylpentanediol-(l ,4), 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-diol-<br>
(1,3), 2-ethylhexanediol-(l,3), 2,2-diethylpropane-diol-(l,3), hexanediol-(l,3), 1,4-<br>
di-(hydroxyethoxy)-benzene, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane, 2,4-<br>
dihydroxy-l,l,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclobutane, 2,2,4,4 tetramethylcyclobutanediol,<br>
2,2-bis-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)-<br>
propane,	isosorbide,	hydroquinone,	BDS-(2,2-(sulfonylbis)4,l-<br>
phenyleneoxy))bis(ethanol), mixtures thereof, and the like.    Pre-polyesters and polyesters may be prepared from one or more of the above type diols.<br>
Some preferred comonomers comprise terephthalic acid, dimethyl terephthalate, isophthalic acid, dimethyl isophthalate, dimethyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol (CHDM), 1,4-butanediol, polytetramethyleneglyocl, trans-DMCD (trans-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylate), trimellitic anhydride, dimethyl cyclohexane-l,4-dicarboxylate, dimethyl decalin-2,6 dicarboxylate, decalin dimethanol, decahydronaphthalane 2,6-dicarboxylate, 2,6-dihydroxymethyl-decahydronaphthalene, hydroquinone, hydroxybenzoic acid, mixtures thereof, and the like. Bifunctional (A-B type where the ends are not the same) comonomers, such as hydroxybenzoic acid may also be included.<br>
Some specific reactants or mixtures of reactants of very special interest comprise terephthalic acid (TPA; understood to include crude, purified (PTA) or<br>
that in between), dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM), isophthalic acid (IPA), ethylene glycol (EG) or combinations thereof.<br>
Many types of polyesters may be made using the processes of the present invention. Two of special interest are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PETG (PET modified with CHDM).<br>
Ranges stated in this disclosure and the claims that follow should be understood to disclose the entire range specifically and not just end points(s). For example, disclosure of the range 0 to 10 should be taken to specifically disclose 2, 2.5, and 3.17 and all other number subsumed in the range and not just 0 and 10. Further a disclosure of Cl to C5 (one to five carbon) hydrocarbons would be a specific disclosure of not only Cl and C5 hydrocarbons, but also of C2, C3, and C4 hydrocarbons; ranges that are clearly meant to be ranges of integers should be understood correspondingly.<br>
One area of intense interest regarding polyester processes using a pipe reactor is the effect of flow regime in the pipe. Surprisingly, it has been determined that under many circumstances it may be desirable to operate the esterification pipe reactor, at least in part, in a stratified flow regime. Accordingly, the processes of the present invention include those previously described wherein stratified flow appears in the pipe (of an esterification pipe reactor). For this purpose, stratified flow may be defined as a flow pattern in a pipe in which liquid flows along the bottom and vapor flows over a liquid-vapor interface. Pipe reactors can be designed by those of ordinary skill in the art to meet this criteria in operation by application of standard engineering design techniques with reference to the disclosures herein.<br>
hi the systems considered here, operation so that stratified flow appears in the pipe will produce two, three or more phase systems.<br>
Given different pipe designs, it may be desirable to operate with stratified flow in a certain given percentage or section(s) of the pipe. Calculations to determine needed parameters may be performed by those of ordinary skill in the art using standard engineering tools after consultation of the disclosures herein.<br>
Esterification pipe reactors operated to produce liquid superficial velocities inside the pipe of less than 0.15 m/s and corresponding vapor superficial velocities less than 3.0 m/s, both across any full cross sectional area inside the pipe perpendicular to the (overall) flow path in the pipe (at that cross section) will in very many of the systems considered herein be in a stratified flow regime, at least in part. Even if not, the regime present should be acceptable. Thus, the processes of the present invention include those previously described wherein the liquid superficial velocity is less than 0.15 m/s (with one preferred range of 0.01 to 0.15 m/s for the liquid) and the vapor superficial velocity is less than 3.0 m/s (with one preferred range of 0.01 to 3.0 m/s and another of 0.6 to 3.0 m/s for the vapor) across any full cross sectional area inside the pipe perpendicular to the (overall) flow path in the pipe (at that cross section). (Of course, each phase must be moving at some point or there can be no stratified flow).<br>
Given different pipe designs, it may be desirable to operate with superficial velocities as above in a certain given percentage or section(s) of the pipe. Calculations to determine needed parameters may be performed by those of ordinary skill in the art using standard engineering tools after consultation of the disclosures herein.<br>
Two parameters of interest in the art relating to the present invention are the Baker plot parameters, Bx and By. These are defined as<br>
Bx = (GL A i/J )/GG , dimensionless and By = (Go/ A), lb/(sec ft2)<br>
where, 1 = (p'cpL')'/2 ;0 = (I/ °")( I* 'i/Cp'O2)1'3 ;GG = vapor mass velocity; GL = liquid mass velocity; |V L = ratio of liquid viscosity to water viscosity, dimensionless; p'c = ratio of vapor density to air density, dimensionless; P'L = ratio of liquid density to water density, dimensionless; <j ratio of liquid surface></j>
20° C (68° F) and 101.3 kPa (14.7 lbf/in2).    See Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 6th ed., pp 5-40 and 5-41.<br>
Esterification pipe reactors operated such that Bx is less than 4.0 while By is less than 2.0 or Bx is greater than or equal to 4.0 while (log ioBy) is less than or equal to -0.677(log 10 Bx) + 0.700 on average across any full cross sectional area inside the pipe perpendicular to the (overall) flow path in the pipe (at that cross section) will in very many of the systems considered herein be in a stratified flow regime, at least in part. Even if not, the regime present should be acceptable. Thus, the processes of the present invention include those previously described wherein Bx is less than 4.0 while By is less than 2.0 or Bx is greater than or equal to 4.0 while (log 10 By) is less than or equal to -0.677(log 10 Bx) + 0.700 on average across any full cross sectional area inside the pipe perpendicular to the (overall) flow path in the pipe (at that cross section).<br>
Given different pipe designs, it may be desirable to operate with Bx and By as above in a certain given percentage or section(s) of the pipe. Calculations to determine needed parameters may be performed by those of ordinary skill in the art using standard engineering tools after consultation of the disclosures herein.<br>
The processes according to the present invention also include those corresponding to those described above wherein the pipe is constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows an overall downward (outlet lower than inlet), but not totally vertical path and such path may be in addition generally non-upward, non-vertical.<br>
The apparatuses according to the present invention include those corresponding to the processes of the present invention. In particular, an apparatus for making a pre-polyester comprising: an esterification pipe reactor comprising a pipe, the pipe having an inlet and an outlet and constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows a path that is not totally vertical nor totally horizontal, and wherein pre-polyester forming reactants are passed towards the outlet.<br>
More specifically, the pipe may be constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows an overall upward, but not totally vertical path and this path may also be generally non-downward, non-vertical. The pipe may also be substantially empty (as defined previously).<br>
The apparatuses according to the present invention also include those for making a polyester oligomer, a polyester or both comprising any of the apparatuses previously described and a polycondensation reactor connected to the outlet of the pipe; this last mentioned polycondensation pipe reactor may be a polycondensation pipe reactor or of any other type suitable for polycondensation.<br>
In reference to the apparatuses of the present invention connected means directly or i ndirectly (through abridging piece(s) of process equipment) in fluid communication.<br>
As discussed previously, it is often important to remove vapor from inside the pipe, so the apparatuses of the present invention may further comprise means for removing vapor from inside the pipe at at least one point along the pipe. This point along the pipe could include the inlet or the outlet. In addition or instead of removal from the pipe, vapor could be removed outside of the pipe, generally and/or prior to polycondensation and/or during polycondensation. Means for such vapor removal include vapor disengagers, vents and other devices known in the art. See Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook.<br>
Also as discussed previously, the pipe may be serpentine.<br>
One variation on the apparatuses of the present invention possible is the addition of a tank for holding solubilizing agent (which may be mixed with reactants (polyester monomer precursors here) if desired) that is connected to the pipe at a point other than the outlet. Further, a recycle line connecting the pipe at a point nearer to the outlet than the inlet with the pipe at a point nearer the inlet than the outlet could be employed at least for addition of recycle as a solubilizing agent to the pipe. Similarly, a flow line from the polycondensation reactor to the pipe at a point other than the outlet could also be added.<br>
The apparatuses according to the present invention also include those corresponding to those described above wherein the pipe is constructed such that flow inside the pipe from the inlet to the outlet follows an overall downward, but not totally vertical path and such path may be in addition generally non-upward, non-vertical.<br>
One special consideration for this last mentioned class of apparatuses according to the present invention is keeping the upper sections of the pipe from running dry when the pipe is serpentine. Thus, the apparatuses of the present invention include those further comprising means for removing vapor from the pipe at a least one bend and wherein the pipe is serpentine and has at least one weir at an effective distance from a bend. Means for vapor removal is as previously discussed. Effective distance for the weir refers to a hydraulically effective distance to achieve the objective of keeping the upper pipe sections from going totally dry; this can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art using standard engineering methods following study of the disclosures herein.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the apparatuses of the present invention as well as the corresponding processes. Optional tank 1 is for storage of solubilizing agent which may be mixed with reactants. It is connected (if present) by 1A to the pipe of the esterification pipe reactor 5. Pipe inlet 3 is where fresh reactants are ordinarily charged to the reactor and is a reference point for flow through the pipe 5. Pipe 5 is shown in a preferred orientation such that several horizontal sections are bridged by upward bends and the inlet 3 is below the pipe outlet 11 in elevation. During operation, reactants flow through the pipe 5 forming pre-polyester. Shown here near the pipe outlet 11 is an optional vapor disengager 7 and vapor line 7A for discharge of vapor from the flow in the pipe; as explained previously, vapor build up may negatively affect product yield in the reactor system. Flow through the pipe 5 leaves at the pipe outlet 11. Optionally, flow may be recycled through the recycle line 9. Flow from the pipe outlet 11 optionally enters the polycondensation reactor 15 (if present) which may be a polycondensation pipe reactor as shown. Optionally, some flow from the polycondnesation reactor 15 may be sent to the pipe 5 through<br>
the line 15A. Flows through 9 and 15A may act as solubilizing agents as discussed above.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention can be further illustrated by the following examples, but it should be understood that these examples are included merely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention unless otherwise specifically indicated. Any titles in the examples are given for convenience and should not be taken as limiting.<br>
Example 1<br>
Using ASPEN modeling, exemplary volumes and pipe diameters were calculated for a commercial scale pipe reactor system for esterification of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) in ethylene glycol (EG). ASPEN Plus version 11.1 with Polymers Plus and ASPEN's PET Technology was used. The esterification reactor is modeled as a series of 5 CSTR reactor models followed by a plug flow reactor model. The results of the modeling and a pipe sizing for a stratified flow pipe reactor for esterification using polyester monomer recirculated from the exit to the entrance as a solubilizing agent for the feed PTA and taking off water vapor only at the end of the reactor length are shown in Table 1.<br>

A lab scale esterification pipe reactor was built to demonstrate such esteriftcation of PTA and EG in a laboratory setting. The lab unit consisted of a pipe reactor made of 664.75 inches of 0.5" 18 BWG stainless tubing heated by electric tracing, a 1200 ml receiver with agitator for receiving the output of the pipe reactor and acting as a disengagement zone to allow the removal of vapors, a recirculating monomer gear pump which pumps liquid oligomer from the receiver back into the inlet of the pipe reactor, and a PTA/EG paste feed system which feed raw materials into the recirculating loop.<br>
The reactor was started by charging a PTA based CHDM modified (2.5 weight percent) oligomer of approximately 96% conversion into the receiver (C-01) and filling the pipe reactor with this oligomer in recirculating mode. After recirculating the oligomer at temperature, a PTA/EG paste feed was introduced into the recirculating flow. After the reactor reached steady state, samples were taken from the C-01 receiver at a rate equal to the product generation rate .<br>
These samples were analyzed for percent conversion by proton NMR analysis to determine the extent of reaction that took place in the pipe reactor. Percent Conversion based on Esters were determined by Proton NMR using a Trifluoroacetic Anhydride Method.<br>
Ten mg of the sample to be analyzed is dissolved in 1 ml of a solvent mixture of chloroform-d with 0.05% Tetramethylsilane (TMS)/trifluoroacetic acid-d/trifluoroacetic anhydride in a 72/22/8 volume ratio. The mixture is heated to 50°C and stirred as needed to completely dissolve the sample to be analyzed.<br>
The appropriate amount of the sample solution is transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube and the tube is capped. The proton NMR signal is recorded using an average of 64 signals collections. The NMR signal using a 600 MHz NMR and a<br>
NMR pulse sequence is collected which gives quantitative proton NMR signals and also decouples the carbon 13 NMR frequencies. The NMR spectrum is analyzed by measuring the correct areas calculating the percent conversion of acid groups to ester groups by the areas and calculations below:<br>
Areas between the following chemical shift points referenced to TMS are measured, and percent conversion calculated using the formula.<br>
Area A = 7.92 ppm to 8.47 ppm<br>
Area B = 5.01 ppm to a valley between 4.82 and 4.77 ppm<br>
Area C = 4.82 ppm to a valley between 4.74 and 4.69 ppm<br>
Area D = A valley between 4.28 ppm and 4.18 ppm to a valley between 4.10 and 4.16 ppm<br>
Area E = A valley between 4.10 ppm and 4.16 ppm to a valley between 4.0 and 4.08 ppm<br>
Area F = 8.6 ppm to 8.9 ppm<br>
Area G = 7.55 ppm to 7.8 ppm<br>
Percent Conversion = 100*(B + (0.5*C) + D + (0.5*E))/(A + F + G)<br>
The samples were also analyzed by gas chromatograph for percent DEG by mass to determine the rate of the side reaction. The effect of residence time and recirculation ratio was seen by varying the feed rate of the paste.<br>
Results from laboratory runs can be seen in Table 4 below.<br>

Model Comparison<br>
An ASPEN model was used to simulate the lab apparatus previously described in this example. In this case, ASPEN 11.1 with Polymers Plus, and ASPEN's PET Technology was used for the modeling with a model configuration similar t o t he o ne d escribed f or e xamples 1 -3. Neither m odel c onfiguration n or software were significantly different from that used in examples 1-3. In order to correctly simulate the dissolution of PTA into the oligomer at different conditions in the lab, it was sometimes necessary to add dissolution kinetics to the model. Table 5 shows three comparisons of lab runs with the model without dissolution kinetics included; this model was found to be of reasonable accuracy when the experimental conditions resulted in completely dissolved PTA as in these runs. Table 5 also shows two examples of comparisons of lab runs with the model including the dissolution kinetics; this model including the dissolution kinetics closely matches the measured conversion when free PTA is present at the end of the lab scale pipe reactor as in these runs. Conversion is defined in this context as the percentage of reactive (acid if use PTA as here) end groups in the liquid phase that are esterified as measured at the outlet of reactor.<br>
