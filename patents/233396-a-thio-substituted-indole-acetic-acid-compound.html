[ HJPGDa was purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences with a specific activity of 100-210Ci/mmol, All other chemicals were of analytical grade.<br>
HEK cells expressing rhCRTh2 / Gal 6 were routinely maintained in DMEM containing 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (HyClone), Img/ml geneticin, 2mM L-glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids. For the preparation of membranes, the adherent transfected HEKcells were grown to confluence in two layer tissue culture factories (Fisher, catalogue number TKT-170-070E), Maximal levels of receptor expression were induced by addition of 500mM sodium butyrate for the last 18 hours of culture. The adherent cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50ml per cell factory) and detached by the addition of 50ml per cell factory of ice-cold membrane homogenisation buffer [20mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, ImM EDTA, O.lmM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride and 1 OOug/mi bacitracin]. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4°C, re-suspended in half the original volume of fresh membrane homogenisation buffer and disrupted using a Polytron homogeniser for 2 x 20 second bursts keeping the tube in ice at all times. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4°C and the membrane fraction pelleted by centrifugation at 90000xg for 30 minutes at 4°C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of membrane homogenisation buffer per cell factory used and the protein content determined. Membranes were stored at -80°C in suitable aliquots.<br>
All assays were performed in Corning clear bottomed, white 96-well NBS plates (Fisher). Prior to assay, the HEK cells membranes containing CRTh2 were coated onto SPA PVT WGA beads (Amersham). For coating membranes were incubated with beads at typically 25|ig membrane protein per mg beads at 4°C with constant agitation overnight. (The optimum coating concentrations were determined for each batch of membranes) The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (SOOxg for 7minutes at 4°C), washed once with assay buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 5mM magnesium chloride) and finally re-suspended in assay buffer at a bead concentration of lOmg/ml.<br>
Each assay contained 20(il of 6.25nM [3H]PGD2, 20ul membrane saturated SPA beads both in assay buffer and 10ul of compound solution or 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin D? (DK-PGD2, for determination of non-specific binding, Cayman chemical<br>
company). Compounds and DK-PGD2 were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the same solvent to 1 OOx the required final concentration. Assay buffer was added to give a final concentration of 10% DMSO (compounds were now at lOx the required final concentration) and this was the solution added to the assay plate. The assay plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and counted on a Wallac Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (1 minute per well).<br>
