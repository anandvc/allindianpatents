				<td>DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF WATER-SOLUBLE AZOLE PRODRUGS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an improvement of a process for preparation of a water-soluble prodrug. More specifically, the present invention relates to the process for preparation of the water-soluble azole prodrug having a phosphate group.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] The compound represented by the following formula is known as one example of water-soluble prodrugs (for instance, refer to Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2). This compound is a water-soluble azole prodrug useful for in the treatment of serious systemic fungal infection.<br>
[0003]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0004]        In addition, this water-soluble prodrug is also known to be preparable by the following scheme (refer to Patent Document 2 ow).[0005]<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
[0006]        In   the   above   formula,   t-Bu   represents   tert-butyl,   THF   represents<br>
tetrahydrofuran and TFA represents trifluoroacetic acid.   As illustrated in the above<br>
scheme,     in    order    to    prepare    the    water-soluble    azole    prodrugs,    first,<br>
chloromethylphosphates (corresponding to Y in the above scheme) and active drug<br>
compounds (corresponding to X in the above scheme) having a hydroxyl group are<br>
reacted to obtain an intermediate compound Z, then, the intermediate compound Z is subjected to deprotection reaction to be converted into the water-soluble azole prodrugs. Introducing in this way a phosphonooxymethyl moiety into a hydroxyl group-containing drug is known as a process for preparing the water-soluble prodrugs of the hydroxyl group-containing drug. Note that the term "prodrug" means a derivative of a drug compound, which reverts in vivo to the original drug compound (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "parent compound"); water-soluble prodrug formulation of active ingredients is often the subject of research and development.<br>
[0007] Then, when the deprotection reaction of the above intermediate compound Z is followed by sodium salt formation, the reaction yield from these two steps has been reported to be approximately 12% (following scheme: for example, refer to Patent Document 1). Note that, in the following formula, t-Bu represents tert-butyl.<br>
[0008]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0009] However, since the intermediate compound Z deprotection reactions disclosed in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 use a halogen-based solvent such as methylene chloride, industrialization thereof would place a large burden on the environment, accompanied by the complexity of waste liquid treatment.<br>
[0010]        In   addition,   as   described   earlier,   since   the   reaction   yield   when<br>
deprotection reaction is followed by sodium salt formation is 12%, with this reaction yield, the reaction cannot be called effective from the point of view of industrial preparation, and is extremely inadequate for large amount syntheses at an industrial scale. Therefore, additional improvements are sought regarding the deprotection reaction of the above-mentioned intermediate compound Z from the point of view of industrial preparation.<br>
[0011] Meanwhile, as a preferred mode of water-soluble azole prodrug, a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the prodrug is disclosed in the above Patent Document 1. In addition, in Patent Document 1, water-solubility is reported to be better than that of the parent compound, by turning the prodrug into a salt. Specifically, a dilysine salt and a tert-butyl amine salt of water-soluble azole prodrugs are disclosed in Patent Document 1; however, improvement of physical properties of the salt per se is sought, in addition to solubility in water.<br>
[Patent Document 1] Published Japanese Translation of a PCT Application No. 2003-520235 (International Publication No. WO01/52852)<br>
[Patent Document 2] Published Japanese Translation of a PCT Application No. 2004-518640 (International Publication No. WO02/42283)<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0012]       An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation,<br>
or the like, suitable for the industrialization of the deprotection reaction in the above<br>
intermediate compound Z without using a toxic solvent, as well as to provide a<br>
process, or the like, for preparing effectively a high quality water-soluble azole<br>
prodrug.<br>
[0013] Thus, in view of the above situation, the present inventors carried out earnest studies on the deprotection reaction of tert-butyl phosphate derivative, which is the intermediate compound Z, and as a result, found that the by-production of amide compound in the process of deprotection could be suppressed by carrying out the deprotection reaction in the presence of a carbocation scavenger, allowing the deprotection reaction yield to be brought to approximately 85% or greater, and that this deprotection reaction was suitable for the industrial process for preparation, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.<br>

can be prepared according to the description disclosed in the patent. On the other hand, Compound (Vb) is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,300,353, and can be prepared according to the description disclosed in this patent.<br>
[0046] For di-tert-butyl chloromethylphosphate, which is Compound (VI), commercially available product may be used as-is, or it can also be prepared from the commercially available products according to the reaction scheme shown below.<br>

[0049]        Describing Step (A) in detail, this step is a step in which Compound (V),<br>
which is an antifungal parent compound having a hydroxyl group, is converted into<br>
phosphate (II) by carrying out o-alkylation using Compound (VI) in the presence of a<br>
base    In particular, when iodide or an iodide ion source is added in this step, the<br>
yield of o-alkylation Is improved dramatically.  Specific examples of base used in the<br>
present step may include, but are not limited to, sodium hydride, potassium hydride,<br>

Specific examples of the ether solvents used in the extraction may include tetrahydrofuran, methyl tert-butyl ether, diethyl ether and the like.

[0052]        With respect to Step (B)<br>
Step (B) is a step in which Compound (II) is subjected to a deprotection reaction while at the same time a salt of the water-soluble azole prodrug, for example,<br>
Compound (IV), is prepared. In more detail, this Step (B) comprises the step of carrying out the deprotection reaction in the presence of the carbocation scavenger as described above, the step of carrying out a predetermined post-processing after this deprotection reaction without taking out Compound (III) per se, which is a reaction product, the step of forming the desired salt, and the step of crystallizing a solvate containing the salt.<br>
[0053] The step of carrying out the deprotection reaction according to the present invention is broadly divided into two cases, in which one is carried out in the presence of the first organic acid and carbocation scavenger used in the deprotection reaction (hereinafter simply referred to as "first aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention") and the other is carried out in the presence of only the carbocation scavenger (hereinafter simply referred to as "second aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention"). Herein, the case of carrying out the deprotection reaction in the presence of only the carbocation scavenger, that is to say, the case of the second mode of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention, is a case in which an inorganic acid is used, and since the inorganic not only is used in the deprotection reaction but also plays the role of the carbocation scavenger, a decrease in the costs can be realized for industrial preparation on the point that other acids such as the aforementioned first organic acid are unnecessary.<br>
[0054]        In the first aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present<br>
invention, this reaction is carried out in the presence of the first organic acid and the<br>
carbocation  scavenger.     The first organic acid used  in the first aspect of the<br>
deprotection  reaction  according to the   present  invention,   is  an  acid   used   in<br>
deprotection reaction.   Specific examples of the first organic acid used in the present<br>
invention may include trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid and the like, preferably trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and toluene sulfonic acid, and more preferably trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
[0055] Specific examples of the carbocation scavenger used in the first aspect of deprotection reaction according to the present invention may include C1-C6 alkoxybenzene which may have a substituent, C1-C6 alkylthiobenzene which may have a substituent, nitrile compounds and combinations thereof, preferably anisole, m-methoxyanisole, thioanisole, acetonitrile, propiononitrile, benzonitrile and combinations thereof, and the like. Preferably, at least approximately 30 equivalents of the first organic acid is used based on Compound (II) and at least 5 equivalents of the carbocation scavenger is used based on Compound (II).<br>
[0056] Specific examples of the solvents used in the first aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention may include, although there is no particular limitation as long as they dissolve the starting materials to some extent without inhibiting the reaction, ester solvents, ether solvents, alcohol solvents, and the like, preferably, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, diethyl ether, dimethoxymethane, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and the like, and more preferably, butyl acetate, dimethoxy ethane, methyl tert-butyl ether and methanol. Note that, in the case of the first aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention, when the carbocation scavenger used is a solution, the carbocation scavenger per se can be also used as the solvent.<br>
f0057]        In the second aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention,  the deprotection  reaction is carried  out in the presence of only the<br>
carbocation scavenger. In this case, the carbocation scavenger is an inorganic acid. The term "inorganic acid" as carbocation scavenger used in the present invention, refers to an acid containing a nonmetal, such as, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodide, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus.   Specific examples of inorganic acid used in the present invention may include hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid, hypochlorous acid, nitric acid,  sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid,  hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic   acid   and  the  like,   preferably  hydrochloric   acid,   hydrofluoric  acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, and more  preferably  hydrochloric  acid.      Preferably,   20  to  40 equivalents  of the carbocation scavenger in the second aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention is used based on Compound (II), and, particularly preferably, approximately 30 equivalents of the carbocation scavenger are used.     Specific examples of solvent used in the second aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention may include, although there is no particular limitation as long as they dissolve the starting materials to some extent without inhibiting the reaction, ether solvents, alcohol solvents and the like, preferably diethyl ether, dimethoxy methane, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and the like, and more preferably dimethoxy methane and ethanol.<br>
[0058] The reaction temperature of the deprotection reaction in the first and second aspects of the present invention is not limited in particular, and is generally from -20 to 10°C, preferably from -10 to 8°C, and more preferably from -5 to 5°C; the reaction time is from 0.1 to 10 hours, preferably from 0.2 to 8 hours, and more preferably from 0.5 to 6 hours.<br>
[0059]        With respect to post-processing step<br>
As described above, since the deprotection reaction in the first and second aspects employ acids, post-processing by neutralization using bases is preferably carried out while transferring the used acids to an aqueous layer. Specific examples of the base may include dipotassium hydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate and the like can.<br>
[0060]       With respect to the salt generation to crystallization steps<br>
Next, the salt represented by Formula (I) is produced without taking out Compound (III). Note that the salt may also be produced once Compound (III) has been taken out. In addition, a solvate of salt, such as represented by Formula (IV), can also be produced, as necessary.<br>

[0062]       (in the above chemical formula, X represents a fluorine atom bonded at position 4 or position 5 of the phenyl group.)<br>
The formation of the salt is carried out by reacting Compound (III) with lysine in the presence of water, an organic solvent and an acid, producing a mono lysine salt of Compound (III) (salt represented by Formula (I)).<br>

Here, the organic solvent is preferably an organic solvent miscible with water. Specific examples of organic solvent may include, although there is no particular limitation as long as they dissolve the starting materials to some extent without inhibiting the reaction, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol and the like, preferably methanol and ethanol, and more preferably ethanol. The acid is a second organic acid different from the first organic acid used in the deprotection reaction. Examples of the second organic acid may include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and the"like, and preferably acetic acid.  When converting into a lysine salt, for<br>
the lysine used, preferably at least 1 to 3 equivalents of the second organic acid are used based on Compound (III), and an aqueous solution of lysine salt is used. The temperature when converting into a salt is not limited in particular, which is from room temperature to 40°C, and preferably from room temperature to 35°C.<br>
[0066] In more detail, in order to produce effectively a solvated salt of Compound (111) using an aqueous solution of dissolved lysine, the following procedure is performed preferably. First, Compound (III) is extracted using an aqueous solution containing an alkaline metal salt. Examples of the alkaline metal salts in this case may include, but are not limited to, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate and the like Thereafter, the aqueous solution containing the alkaline metal chlorinated Compound (III) is neutralized momentarily with an acid, as necessary, while further adjusting a pH of this aqueous solution to 3 or less, preferably to 2.5 or less, and more preferably to 2.2 or less, Compound (III) is extracted with an organic solvent such as butyl acetate, then, treated with an aqueous solution containing lysine, allowing an aqueous solution containing the lysine chlorinated Compound (III) to be obtained.<br>
[0067]        Thereafter, the above second organic acid is added to the aqueous<br>
solution containing the lysine chlorinated Compound (III), the pH of the aqueous<br>
solution is adjusted to 6 or less, preferably to 5.5 or less, and more preferably to 5.0<br>
or less, then, when the above organic solvent miscible with water is added,  a<br>
monolysine salt solvated by the organic solvent is produced efficiently.  Acetic acid is<br>
particularly preferred as the second organic acid mentioned above.    In addition,<br>
ethanol is preferred as the organic solvent mentioned above, and the compound<br>
represented by Formula (IV) is prepared as the solvate.   A seed crystal may be<br>
added for crystallization as a solvate. Specifically, after ethanol has been added, the<br>
Retention time (Compound (VII (a))) = 8.6min; retention time (Compound (VII (b))) = 11 1min.<br>
[0076] From the results shown in Fig. 1, the deprotection reactions, which used trifiuoroacetic acid as the first organic acid and anisole, thioanisole, acetonitrile and benzonitrile as carbocation scavengers, were found to be highly efficient reactions (reaction yields were 95% or greater).<br>
[0077] In addition, Fig. 1 also shows the results obtained by the second aspect of the deprotection reaction according to the present invention. In the second aspect, the deprotection reaction was examined in a system in which the acid, specifically hydrochloric acid, which is a type of inorganic acid, was made available by the carbocation scavenger per se (30 equivalents based on the compound of Example 1) and methanol was used as solvent. From the results shown in Fig. 1, when using hydrochloric acid as the carbocation scavenger, and methanol, .which is a non-halogen-based solvent, as reaction solvent, the deprotection reaction could be carried out without generating the amide compound.<br>

temperature of the reaction solution is raised to 35 to 60°C, and stirring is carried out for 1 hour to 8 hours, and preferably for 2 hours to 7 hours. Thereafter, the temperature of the reaction solution is cooled to 5 to 30°C, and preferably to 22 to 28°C, stirring is carried out for at least 17 hours or longer, and preferably for 17 hours to 65 hours, and then, the produced crystal is recovered by filtration. In this way, from Compound (II), which is the starting material, via the highly efficient deprotection reaction according to the present invention, Compound (IV) can be prepared and isolated.<br>
