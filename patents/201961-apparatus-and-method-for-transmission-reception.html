				<td>DESCRIPTION APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMISSION/RECEPTION<br>
5  Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for transmission/reception carrying out transmit power control, mounted on a communication apparatus in a mobile radio communication system.<br>
10<br>
Background Art<br>
CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), one of radio communication access systems, is an access system in which a same frequency or same time is shared by a<br>
15  plurality of users.  In the case where a desired<br>
transmitting station is far and an undesired interfering station is near, if these stations carry out transmission with same power, the signal level from the interfering station is greater than the signal level of the desired<br>
2 0  transmitting station, causing a problem of rendering communication impossible.<br>
In a terrestrial mobile communication system, one of the causes of deterioration of channel quality is fading.  Along a terrestrial mobile communication<br>
25  propagation path, a signal sent from a base station is reflected, scattered or diffracted by buildings near a communication terminal, producing a standing wave. When the communication terminal moves amidst this<br><br>
2<br>
standing wave, the level of the signal from the base station reduces in proportion to the traveling speed causing fading by which the reception quality-deteriorates .<br>
5       Therefore, a cellular system using CDMA solves the above problem through transmit power control {TPC), which compensates fading fluctuations and keeps the reception level constant.<br>
Typical examples of transmit power control are<br>
10  closed-loop transmit power control and open-loop transmit power control.<br>
Closed-loop transmit power control is implemented by the other end of communication measuring an SIR 
15  signal from the transmitting station, sending a control command (hereinafter referred to as "TPC command" ) which reduces transmit power when a measured SIR value is higher than a target SIR and increases transmit power when the measured SIR value is lower than the target SIR<br>
20  through the reverse channel, and therefore closed-loop<br>
transmit power control is a method of controlling<br>
transmit power based on the content of the TPC command.<br>
On the other hand, open-loop transmit power control<br>
is a method of controlling transmit power by subtracting<br>
25 the reception level from a known transmission level of the other end of communication, calculating the level of loss along the radio path and adding a target reception level of the other end of communication to this level<br><br>
(7~<br><br>
3<br>
of loss.<br>
However, closed-loop transmit power control involves a large control delay and has difficulty in controlling dynamically, having a disadvantage that the 5  communication quality of the system may drastically reduce when high-speed fading or intense interference emerges.<br>
On the other hand, open-loop transmit power control cannot handle the case where an appropriate reception<br>
10 level varies from one base station to another, which may cause offset errors at the reception levels of the base stations, and moreover open-loop transmit power control cannot compensate reception level measurement errors for every communication terminal, resulting in the necessity<br>
15 for increasing the measurement accuracy on the receiving side of the communication terminal.<br>
That is, both closed-loop transmit power control and open-loop transmit power control have advantages and disadvantages regarding transmit power coirtro'l.<br>
20<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is a first object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for transmission/reception by adaptively switching between<br>
25  closed-loop transmit power control and open-loop<br>
transmit power control thereby making the most of both characteristics and compensating reception level measurement errors without the necessity of maintaining<br><br>
4<br>
high reception measurement accuracy, and provid.in.ja, transmit power control capable of handling cases where high-speed fading or intense interference emerges.<br>
This object is attained by carrying out closed--5  loop transmit power control using a transmit power value based on a TPC command after establishment of a communication channel, calculating a compensation value based on a difference between a reception-level-based transmit power value and a TPC-command-based transmit 10  power value and carrying out open-loop transmit power control using a value obtained by adding the compensation value to the reception-level-based transmit power value after the calculation of the compensation value.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br><br>
6<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below. 5<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG.l is a block diagram showing a configuration of a communication terminal equipped with a transmission/reception apparatus according to<br>
10  Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
The communication terminal shown in FIG. 1 is mainly configured by antenna 101 that transmits/receives a radio frequency signal wave, transmission/reception switching section 102 that switches the timing of<br>
15  transmission/reception, reception section 103 that<br>
processes the reception signal and extracts reception information, control information, TPC commands and reception level, control section 104 that controls various sections based on the control information, TPC<br>
20  commands and reception level and transmission section 105 that sends a transmission signal carrying the transmission information and control information. Control section 104 includes transmit power control section 106 that decides a transmit power value based<br>
25  on the reception level or a TPC command.<br>
FIG.2 is a block diagram showing a configuration of reception section 103 of the communication terminal according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br><br>
7<br>
Reception section 103 includes amplification section 131 that amplifies a reception signal, correlation calculation demodulation section 132 that converts the frequency of the amplified reception signal 5  to a baseband, carries out correlation calculation and demodulates a desired signal, detection section 133 that carries out detection processing using a correlation value and extracts decoded data, decoding section 134 that carries out decoding processing such as Viterbi<br>
10  decoding on the decoded data and outputs reception<br>
information, control information and a TPC command and level measurement section 135 that measures an SIR, a ratio of the level of the reception signal from amplifier section 131 to the level of the desired signal from<br>
15  correlation calculation demodulation section 132.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a configuration of transmission section 104 of the communication terminal according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
20       Transmission section 104 includes coding section 151 that inserts control information into the transmission information and carries out coding processing of a convolutional code, etc., modulation section 152 that performs primary modulation and<br>
25  spreading processing on the coded data and converts the frequency to a radio frequency and amplification section 153 that amplifies the transmission signal modulated based on the transmit power from transmit power control<br><br>
8<br>
section 106 .<br>
FIG.4 is a block diagram showing a configuration of transmit power control section 106 of the communication terminal according to Embodiment 1 of the 5  present invention.<br>
OL-TPC (open-loop transmit power control) section 161 subtracts the reception level output from level measurement section 135 from a known transmission level of the other end of communication, calculates the level<br>
10 lost along a radio path, and determines a transmit power value by adding a target reception level of the other end of communication to this loss level. For example, in the case where the reception level is lower than the transmission level of the other end of communication by<br>
15  25 dB, the transmit power is incremented by 25 dB above the target reception level of the other end of communication.<br>
CL-TPC (closed-loop transmit power control) section 162 calculates a transmit power value by<br>
2 0 incrementing/decrementing the previous transmit power value by a predetermined amount of variation based on the content of a TPC command output from decoding section 134. For example, in the case where TPC command "0" is an increment instruction, TPC command "1" is a decrement<br>
25  instruction and an amount of variation is 1 dB, CL-TPC<br>
section 162 increments the transmit power by 1 dB above<br>
the previous transmit power when the TPC command is "0".<br>
Subtractor 163 subtracts the transmit power value<br><br>
9<br>
output from OL-TPC section 161 from the transmit power value output from CL-TPC section 162 and outputs the difference value to compensation value calculation section 164 .<br>
5        Compensation value calculation section 164 calculates and confirms a compensation value to compensate a reception level measurement error, etc. of the communication terminal based on the difference value output from subtractor 163 .  Then, when the compensation<br>
10  value is confirmed, compensation value calculation<br>
section 164 outputs the control information indicating the confirmation to mode switching section 165.  On the other hand, when a control signal is input from mode switching section 165, compensation value calculation<br>
15 section 164 fixes the confirmed compensation value and outputs it to switch 167.<br>
An available method of confirming the compensation value includes a method of confirming an average of difference values when the range of fluctuations of the<br>
20  average of difference values falls below a predetermined threshold as the compensation value or a method of confirming an average of difference values when a certain time has elapsed after calculation of a compensation value is started as the compensation value, etc.<br>
25 Furthermore, an available method of calculating an average includes a method of simply averaging difference values input for a certain period of time or a method of averaging by adding time weight to difference values.<br><br>
10<br>
etc.<br>
Mode switching section 165 switches and controls switch 167 and switch 169 based on a control information from decoding section 134 or compensation value 5 calculation section 164. When a predetermined mode is entered, mode switching section 165 outputs a control signal to compensation value calculation section 164 and fixes the compensation value. Details of the operation of mode switching section 165 will be given later.<br>
10        "0" data output section 166 outputs "0" as a<br>
compensation value. Switch 167 outputs a compensation value output from either compensation value calculation section 164 or "0" data output section 166 to adder 168 based on the control of mode switching section 165.<br>
15       Adder 168 adds the compensation value from switch 167 to the output of OL-TPC section 161.<br>
Switch 169 outputs the transmit power value output from either adder 16 8 or CL-TPC section 162 to amplification section 153 based on the control of mode<br>
20  switching section 165.<br>
Next, the operation of switching control by mode switching section 165 over switch 167 and switch 169 will be explained using the state transition diagram in FIG.5 and transmit power transition diagram in FIG.6.<br>
25       First, as initial OL-TPC mode (A) , during a period after power is turned on until a communication channel is established, mode switching section 165 connects switch 167 with "0" data output section 166 and connects<br><br>
11<br>
swatch 169 with adder 168.  As a result, the communication terminal performs open-loop transmit power control that carries out no compensation on the transmit power value based on the reception level. 5       Then, upon receipt of the information that the communication channel has been established from the control information output from decoding section 134, mode switching section 165 connects switch 169 with CL-TPC section 162 and enters CL-TPC mode (B).  As a<br>
10 result, the communication terminal performs closed-loop transmit power control with a transmit power value based on a TPC command carried on the reception signal.<br>
Here, while closed-loop transmit power control is in progress, OL-TPC section 161 continues to calculate<br>
15  transmit power values.  These are estimated transmit power values on assumption that open-loop transmit power control is carried out.  Furthermore, as described above, compensation value calculation section 164 calculates and confirms a compensation value based on the value<br>
2 0  obtained by subtracting an estimated transmit power value from the transmit power value currently being used output from CL-TPC section 162 and outputs the control information that the compensation value has been established to mode switching section 165.<br>
25 Upon receipt of the control information that the compensation value has been established, mode switching section 165 connects switch 167 with compensation value calculation section 164, connects switch 169 with adder<br><br>
12<br>
168 and enters OL-TPC mode (C).  At this time, mode switching section 165 outputs a control signal to compensation value calculation section 164 to fix the compensation value.  As a result, the communication 5  terminal performs open-loop transmit power control using a transmit power value obtained from the reception-level-based transmit power value by compensating a reception level measurement error, etc.<br>
Compensating a reception level measurement error,<br>
10 etc. for the reception-level-based transmit power value makes it possible to obtain a transmit power value almost identical to the transmit power value in the case where closed-loop transmit power control is carried out and further handle cases where high-speed fading or intense<br>
15 interference emerges. Once OL-TPC mode (C) is entered, the communication terminal maintains this state.<br>
During handover, however, it is necessary to compensate a reception level error, etc. at the base station in the target cell, and therefore the<br>
2 0  communication terminal enters CL-TPC mode (B) and<br>
performs closed-loop transmit power control as shown in FIG.7. Upon receipt of the information that handover starts from the control information output from decoding section 134, mode switching section 165 connects switch<br>
2 5  169 with CL-TPC section 162, outputs a control signal to compensation value calculation section 164 to recalculate a compensation value.<br>
Moreover, in cases other than handover where the<br><br>
13<br>
communication terminal decides that the accuracy of the compensation value has reduced, it is also possible to change from OL-TPC mode (C) to CL-TPC mode (B). It is possible to decide that the accuracy of the compensation 5  value has reduced when the communication terminal<br>
monitors a TPC command and detects that an increment instruction or decrement instruction is repeated for a certain number of times or that there is an extreme difference in the rate between increment instructions<br>
10 and decrement instructions during a certain period of time. It is also possible for the base station to decide that the accuracy of the compensation value has reduced based on the communication quality such as a reception level, SIR and error detection code and transmit the<br>
15  decision result to the communication terminal as the control information.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG.8, it is also possible to divide the reception level into a certain number of areas and enter CL-TPC mode (B) when the average<br>
2 0  reception level moves across the divided areas during<br>
a certain period of time.  This is effective when the<br>
trend of errors varies depending on the reception level.<br>
It is also possible for the communication terminal<br>
to set an effective period of time for compensation<br>
2 5  values beforehand and enter CL-TPC mode (B) when the effective period of time has elapsed after OL-TPC mode (C) is entered.<br>
As shown above, by calculating a compensation value<br><br>
14<br>
to compensate a reception level measurement error, etc. while closed-loop transmit power control is in progress and carry out open-loop transmit power control using a value obtained by adding the compensation value to the 5  reception-level-based transmit power value, it is<br>
possible to compensate the reception level measurement error without the need to maintain high reception measurement accuracy and carry out transmit power control capable of even handling cases where high-speed<br>
10  fading or intense interference emerges.<br>
Moreover, open-loop transmit power control has fewer TPC errors than closed-loop transmit power control, and therefore the present invention in which open-loop transmit power control occupies a great percentage of<br>
15  time can increase the channel capacity of the system. The present invention can also adaptively switch between open-loop transmit power control and closed-loop transmit power control as the transmit power control method as required.<br>
20<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Embodiment 1 describes the case where the communication terminal adaptively switches between open-loop transmit power control and closed-loop<br>
25  transmit power control.<br>
Here, while the communication terminal is carrying out open-loop transmit power control, the base station need not send a TPC command.  Therefore, the transmission<br><br>
15<br>
efficiency over the downlink will improve if the base station detects that the communication terminal is carrying out open-loop transmit power control and sends other information instead of a TPC command. 5       Embodiment 2 provides a mode in which the base station does not send any TPC command while the communication terminal equipped with the transmission/reception apparatus according to Embodiment 1 is carrying out open-loop transmit power<br>
10  control.  FIG.9 is a block diagram showing a<br>
configuration of the base station according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
The base station shown in FIG. 9 is mainly configured by antenna 201 that transmits/receives a radio frequency<br>
15 signal wave, transmission/reception switching section 202 that switches the timing of transmission/reception, amplification distribution section 203 that distributes the amount of amplification of the reception signal over a number of users, reception section 204 that processes<br>
20  the reception signal and extracts reception information, control information and reception level, control section 205 that controls various sections based on the control information and the reception level, transmission section 206 that sends a transmission signal carrying<br>
2 5 the transmission information, control information and a TPC command and multiplexing, amplification section 207 that multiplexes and amplifies transmission signals to users.  Control section 205 includes TPC command<br><br>
16<br>
generation section 208 that generates TPC commands based on the reception level.<br>
FIG.10 is a block diagram showing a configuration of reception section 204 of the base station according 5  to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
Reception section 204 includes correlation calculation demodulation section 241 that converts the frequency of the reception signal to a baseband, carries out correlation calculation and demodulates a desired<br>
10  signal, detection section 242 that carries out detection processing using a correlation value and extracts decoded data, decoding section 243 that carries out decoding processing such as Viterbi decoding on the decoded data and outputs reception information and<br>
15  control information and level measurement section 244 that measures an SIR, a ratio of the amount of amplification from amplification, distribution section 203 to the level of the desired signal from correlation calculation demodulation section 132.<br>
20 FIG.11 is a block diagram showing a configuration of transmission section 206 of the base station according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
Transmission section 20 6 includes coding section 261 that inserts control information and a TPC command<br>
25  into the transmission information and carries out coding processing of a convolutional code, etc., modulation section 262 that performs primary modulation and spreading processing on the coded data and converts the<br><br>
17<br>
frequency to a radio frequency and amplification section 263 that amplifies the modulated transmission signal.<br>
FIG.12 is a block diagram showing a configuration of TPC command generation section 208 of the base station 5  according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
In FIG.12, comparator 281 generates a TPC command<br>
to instruct the communication terminal to increment or<br>
decrement transmit power based on whether the reception<br>
level output from level measurement section 244 is higher<br>
10  or lower than reference value 282.<br>
Switch 2 83 inserts the TPC command output from comparator 281 or other information at the position of a transmission slot into which the TPC command is to be inserted, based on the control information from decoding 15  section 243.<br>
That is, switch 283 inserts the TPC command in the<br>
case where the communication terminal is carrying out<br>
closed-loop transmit power control and other information<br>
in the case where the communication terminal is carrying<br>
2 0  out open-loop transmit power control.<br>
As described above, by transmitting other information instead of a TPC command while the other end of communication is carrying out open-loop transmit power control, it is possible to improve the transmission 25  efficiency.  This is effective in the present invention in particular in which open-loop transmit power control occupies a great percentage of time.<br>
Here, the embodiments above describe the case where<br><br>
18<br>
the communication terminal decides the timing of switching between modes independently, but the present invention also allows the base station to decide the timing of switching between modes and instruct the 5  communication terminal about the switching timing through control information.<br>
The embodiments above describe transmit power control over the uplink of a communication terminal, but the present invention can also be used for transmit power<br>
10  control over the downlink by a base station.<br>
The embodiments above describe the case where control information and TPC commands as well as transmission information are sent after error correction coding processing.  However, the present invention<br>
15  allows the same effect to be obtained without performing error correction coding processing on control information and TPC commands.  In this case, control information and TPC commands are extracted by the detection section.<br>
20       As described above, the apparatus and method for transmission/reception of the present invention adaptively switches between closed-loop transmit power control and open-loop transmit power control making it possible to make the most of both characteristics and<br>
25  compensate reception level measurement errors without the necessity of maintaining high reception measurement accuracy, and further provide transmit power control capable of handling cases where high-speed fading or<br><br>
19 intense interference emerges<br><br>
