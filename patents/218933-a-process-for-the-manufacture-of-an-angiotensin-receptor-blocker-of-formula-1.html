The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; also called angiotension II receptor antagonist or Ate receptor antagonist) and salts thereof, to novel intermediates and process steps. ARBs can   for example, be used for the treatment of hypertension and related diseases and conditions.<br>
The class of ARBs comprises compounds having different structural features, essentially preferred are the non-peptidic ones. For example, mention may be made of the compounds that are selected from the group consisting of valsartan’cf. EP’3983), losartan (of. EP253310), candesartan (cf. 459136), eprosartan (cf. EP 403159)’jtbesartan (of. EP454511), olmesartan (cf. EP 503785), and tasosartan (cf. EP539086), or, in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
All of these ARBs comprise the following common structural element:<br><br>
The formation of the tetrazole ring is a critical step in the manufacture of these compounds. Methods for the manufacture of ARBs having this structural feature include the formation of said tetrazole ring by starting from corresponding cyano derivatives that react with HN3 or a suitable alkali metal salt thereof such as sodium azide or with an organotin azide such as tributyltin azide or with a silyl azide. The use of azides for forming the tetrazol ring system requires a sophisticated system to run the reaction in a safe way during an up-scaled production process.  , an objective js.to develop altematiye’’process variants that • exclude the use of azides in the last steps of the production of corresponding ARBs.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a synthesis of compounds of formula (I) that (1) does not require a process step where an azide is used, (2) results In high yields, (3)<br><br>
minimises pollution of the environment e.g. by essentially avoiding organotin compounds, (4) is economically attractive by using less reaction steps in the reaction sequence for the manufacture of compounds of formula (I), (5) affords enantiomerically pure target products and products of high crystallisability. In addition, as the tetrazole ring system is formed at an earlier stage of the reaction sequence, (6) the risk of contamination of the final product (and late intermediates) with trace amounts of tin components is much lower. Normally, the tetrazole ring is formed by reacting a corresponding cyano derivative with an organotin compound such as tributyl tin azide. For ecological reasons, the heavy metal tin and especially organotin compounds are to be handled with special care. Furthermore, (7) another objective of the present invention is to provide a process that can be carried out on a larger scale and can thus be used for a corresponding production process and to avoid e.g. racemisation and thus separation of any enantiomers.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the process according to the present invention meets the above objectives.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of the compound of formula (I)<br><br><br>
(I) chiral<br><br>
or a salt thereof, comprising<br><br>
(a)    reacting a compound of formula (II a)<br><br><br><br>
or a salt thereof, wherein Ri is hydrogen or a tetrazole protecting group, with a compound of formula<br><br><br>
OR,<br>
HjN<br>
(lib) chiral<br><br>
or a salt thereof, wherein R2 represents hydrogen or a carboxy protecting group, under the<br>
conditions of a reductive amination; and<br>
(b)    acylating a resulting compound of formula (II c)<br><br><br>
(lie) chiral<br><br>
or a salt thereof with a compound of formula (lid)<br><br><br>
(lid)<br>
R3<br><br>
wherein R3 is an activating group; and,<br>
(c)    if Ri and/or R2 are different form hydrogen, removing the protecting group(s) in a<br>
resulting compound of formula (II e)<br><br><br>
(He) chiral<br><br>
or a salt thereof; and<br>
(d)    isolating a resulting compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof; and, if desired, converting a resulting free acid of formula (I) into a salt thereof or converting a resulting salt of a compound of formula (I) into the free acid of formula (I) or converting a resulting salt of a compound of formula (I) into a different salt.<br>

In reaction Step (a), the reductive amination is carried out in the presence of a reducing agent. A suitable reducing agent is a borohydride, which may also be in a complexed form, or hydrogen or a hydrogen donor both in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. Furthermore, a reducing agent is a suitable selenide or a silane.<br>

A suitable catalyst for the reductive amination with hydrogen or a hydrogen donor is, for example, nickel, such as Raney nickel, and noble metals or their derivatives, for example oxides, such as palladium, platinium or platinum oxide, which may be applied, if desired, to support materials, for example to carbon or calcium carbonate, for example, platinium on carbon. The hydrogenation with hydrogen or a hydrogen donor may preferably be carried out at pressures between 1 and about 100 atmosphere and at room temperature between about -80° to about 200°C, in particular between room temperature and about 100°C.<br>
A preferred hydrogen donor is, for example, a system comprising 2-propanol and, if desired, a base, or, most preferably, formic acid or a salt thereof, e.g. an alkali metal, or tri-Ci-Cz-alkyl-ammonium salt thereof, for example, the sodium or the potassium salt thereof, if desired, in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine.

The hydrogen donor may also be used as solvent, especially 2-propanol or formic acid.<br>
A suitable selenide is, for example, selenophenol which is unsubstituted or substituted. Suitable substituents comprise, for example, one, two or three substituents selected from e.g. halo, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, Ci-Cz-alkyI, Ci-Cy-alkoxy, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl.

A suitable silane is, for example, silane which is trisubstituted by a substituent selected from the group consisting of Ci-Ci2-alkyl, especially d-Cr-alkyl, and C2-C3o-acyl, especially Ci-Cs-acyl. Preferred are commercially available silanes.<br><br>
The reductive amination is preferably carried out under acidic, neutral or preferably under basic conditions. A suitable base comprises, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate. Furthermore, an amine base can be used, for example, tri-d-Cz-alkylamine, such as triethylamlne, tri-n-propylamine, tri-butylamine or ethyl-diisopropylamine, a piperidine, such as N-methylpiperidine, or a morpholine, such as N-methyl-morpholine. Preferred bases include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate and potassium carbonate. Especially preferred is sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or tri-n-propylamine.<br>
The reductive amination is carried out in a suitable inert solvent or a mixture of solvents including water. Inert solvents conventionally do not react with the corresponding starting materials of formulae (II a) and (II b). If an alkali metal borohydride such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride; an earth alkali metal borohydride such as calcium borohydride; an alkali metal cyanoborohydride, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or lithium cyanoborohydride, is used as reducing agent, for example, a polar solvent, for example, an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or 2-methoxyethanol, or glyme, is preferred. If an alkali metal tri-(Ci-C7-alkoxy)-borohydride such as sodium trimethoxy-ethoxy-borohydride; a tetra-Ci-C7-alkylammonium-(cyano)borohydride such as tetrabutylammonium-borohydride or tetrabutylammonium-cyanoborohydride, is used as reducing agent, for example, hydrocarbons, such as toluene, esters such as ethylacetate or isopropylacetate, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or tert-butylmethylether are preferred. If hydrogen or a hydrogen donor is used as reducing system, each in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, a polar solvent is preferred. The reductive amination can also be carried out e.g. In a mixture of an organic solvent with water, both mono- and biphasic. In a biphasic system a phase transfer catalyst such as tetrabutylammoniumhalide, e.g. bromide, or benzyltrimethylammonium halide, e.g. chloride, may be added.<br>
If Ri and R2 both represent a protecting group and if the compound of formula (lib) is a free base, the presence of a base is not required. If,, however, Ri.ls hydrogen and R2 is a protecting group, not more than a molar equivalent of a base may be added. In order to avoid racemisation, the reaction is preferably carried out by using less than an equimolar amount of a base. If Ri and R2 each are hydrogen, no racemisation is observed even if the<br><br>
reaction is carried out with equal or more than one equivalent of base under mild conditions, preferably at temperatures between -10°C and 20°C.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to novel compounds of formula (II a) that can be used as intermediates for the manufacture of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The present invention likewise relates to novel compounds of formula (II b) that can be used as intermediates for the manufacture of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (II a) with a compound of formula (II b) results in an intermediately formed imine (Schiff base) of formula (II c')<br><br>
(IIC) chiral<br>
R,o,<br><br>
that can, under certain reaction conditions, be isolated or that can be subjected to the reduction without isolation.<br>
The reductive amination is a two-step reaction, the formation of an imine by removing water, followed by the reduction step. The removal is an equilibrium reaction, which can be directed to the formation of an imine by continously eliminating the water, for example, by azeotropic removal. Furthermore, a water scavenger may be used to remove or inactivate free water which may be effected by a physical process such as absorption or agsprption or by a chemical reaction. A suitable water scavenger includes without limitation anhydrides of organic acid, aluminosilicates such as molecular sieves, other zeolites, finely divided silica gel, finely divided aluminia, anhydrides of inorganic acids such as phosphoric anhydride<br><br>
(P2O5), Inorganic sulfates such as calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate, and other inorganic salts such as calcium chloride.<br>
If Step (a) is carried out via first manufacturing and isolating a compound of formula (II c'), a compound of formula (II a) is reacted with a compound of formula (II b), maybe in the presence of a base, if Ri and/or R2 are hydrogen. Compounds of formula (II c') can then be converted into corresponding compounds of formula (II c) by reducing the compounds of formula (II c') with a corresponding reducing agent as mentioned above.<br>
The intermediate imine of formula (II c') can, for example, be isolated by removal of the solvent, e.g. by distillation, especially by azeotropic removal of water.<br>
In a preferred variant, the reductive amination is carried out without isolating a compound of formula (II c').<br>
The reductive amination is most preferably carried out without removal of free water, especially, if Ri and R2 being hydrogen and with a base such as sodium hydroxide, a solvent such as methanol and a reducing reagent such as sodium borohydride.<br>
In view of the imine structural element, compounds of formula (II c') comprise both the corresponding E and the corresponding Z isomer thereof. Preferred is the E isomer.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to compounds of formula (II c') wherein Ri is hydrogen or a tetrazole protecting group and wherein R2 is hydrogen or a carboxy protecting group. Corresponding compounds can be used as intermediates for the manufacture of the compound of formula (I). Preferred are compounds of formula (II C), wherein at least one of Ri and R2 represents hydrogen or both of Ri and R2 represent hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of formulae (II a) and (II b) are partially known and can be prepared<br>
according to methods known per se.       ■,. , ■	-’ .	‘.     .•&gt;-.,.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a process for the manufacture of the compound of formula<br><br><br>
(II a')<br>
or a salt thereof, comprising (I)     reacting a compound of formula<br><br><br>

by treatment with an acid, preferably in the presence of water, (iv)    a resulting compound of formula (II a') or a salt thereof.<br>
The reactions Steps (i) -(iv) described above in the variants are carried out, for example, In the absence or, customarily, in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof, the reaction, as required, being carried out with cooling, at room temperature or with warming, for example in a temperature range from about -80°C up to the boiling point of the reaction medium, preferably from about -10°C to about +2po°C, and, if necessary, in a closed vessel, under pressure, in an inert gas atmosphere and/or under anhydrous   ■ conditions.<br>
Step (i) is carried out, for example, the in the presence of 0.0001 to 0.1 equivalents, preferably 0.001 to 0.04 equivalents of a Bronstedt acid, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, para-toluenesulfonic acid, camphor-10-sulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, 0,0'-dibenzoyltartaric acid and the like.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a solvent which is sufficiently stable under anhydrous acidic conditions, e. g. in ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, an aromatic solvent, such as toluene or xylene, or an ethereal solvent, such as tert-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrof uran, butyl ether or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or a nitrile, such as acetonitrile. A preferred solvent Is toluene. The reaction temperature is between 15°C and the boiling point of the reaction medium, preferably between 30 and BO°C.<br>
Step (ii) is carried out, for example, by using a conventional transition metal catalyst, for example, corresponding conventionally used platinium or palladium catalyst palladium, such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(ll).<br><br>
step (ill) carried out, for example, by dissolving a resulting compound of formula (IV e) in water or a mixture of water and an appropriate organic solvent and subsequent treating with an acid at elevated temperature. Crystallization of the product is accomplished by distilling off all or a part of the organic solvent, adding water, cooling the mixture or a combination of these measures. Appropriate organic solvents are ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan, butyl ether, nitriles, such as acetonitrile, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, isopropyl acetate, toluene, xylene, acetic acid or formic acid. Preferred solvents are methanol and ethanol. Suitable acids are Bronsted acids, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, para-toluenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, formic acid. Preferred acids are sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. The amount of acid used is between 0.05 and 6.0 equivalents with respect to the starting material, preferably between 0.1 and 1.5 equivalents.<br>
The isolation Step (iv) is carried out according to conventional isolation methods, such as by crystallizing the resulting compound of formula (II a') from the reaction mixture - if desired or necessary after work-up, especially by extraction - or by chromatography of the reaction mixture.<br>
The compounds of formula (IV d) are prepared by reacting a compound of formula<br><br>

wherein X is halogen, for example, bromo, with magnesium under Grignard conditions, especially under anhydrous conditions, preferably in the presence of an activator such as 1,2-dibromo-ethane, to form a copmpound of formula<br><br>
X-Mg      ‘	(IV d"),<br>
which is then treated with Zn(X)2 , X being halogen, especially chloro.<br><br>
As mentioned in the beginning of the specification, most of the angiotensin II receptor antagonists comprise as structural feature the tetrazole ring. In process sequences for the manufacture of such compounds the use of a protecting group for the tetazole ring is required.<br>
For example, the triphenylmethyl group to protect the tetrazole ring against organometallic reagents is used. The triphenylmethyl group is cleaved later under acidic conditions. A disadvantage of the triphenylmethyl group is regarded to be its high molecular weight. The 2-phenyl-2-propyl tetrazole protecting group is used to enable a metallation prior to any further conversion. The removal of this protecting group requires corrosive and toxic reagents, such as boron trifluoride etherate, or a transition metal catalyzed deprotection step, which are regarded as a disadvantage.<br>
The protection of a tetrazole ring against organometallic reagents by using a 2-methyl-2-propyl group is another variant. For its removal this group requires harsh acidic conditions which are not compatible with sensitive functional groups in the compound or product.<br>
Alternatively, the 2-cyanoethyl tetrazole protecting group is being used. The low stability of this protecting group towards most organometallic reagents, and the formation of highly toxic byproducts during deprotection are regarded as disadvantages.<br>
Tetrazole rings can also be protected by a (phenylmethyl)oxymethyl group. However, one type of the two isomers formed is not stable towards organometallic reagents, not even at low temperatures.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a synthesis for the compound of formula (II a') or salts thereof by using protective groups which (1) do not have the disadvantages described above, (2) are easily introduced in high yield, (3) are of low weight, (4) are stable in the presence of organometallic reagents, such as aryl zinc and aryl magnesium compounds, (5) are easily removed in high yield under acidic conditions which are compatible with sensitive functional groups, such as a formyl group.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the process as described immediately above meets the above objectives. For example, a person skilled in the art would not expect that compounds<br><br>
of formula (IV c) can be used for the coupling with a compound of formula (IV d), as corresponding protecting groups of the tetrazole ring of compounds of formula (IV d) were not considered to stable in such a metal organic coupling reaction. A person skilled In the art would expect that corresponding protection groups of the tetrazoles of formula (IV d) would be split off. Furthermore, a person skilled in the art would expect that corresponding protection groups of the tetrazoles of formula (IV e) would be split off that easily under the mild conditions as outlined above.<br>
Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention are novel compounds of formulae (IV a), (IV b), (IV c), (IV d), (IV d'), (IV d"), and (IV e), especially compounds of formula (IV e).<br>
A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of formula<br><br>
R6’   ‘R7<br>
(IV e),<br>
wherein R5 and R'5, independently of one another, represent Ci-Cy-alkyI, such as methyl or ethyl, or together form C2-C4-alkylene, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene or 1,2-dimethylethyiene or 2,2-dimethyipropylene, or wherein Re, R? and Re, independently of one another, represent hydrogen or Ci-Cr-alkyI, such as methyl or ethyl, and Rg represents Ci-Cy-alkyI, or R7 and Rg together form C2-C5-alkylene, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, or Re and RQ together form Ca-Ce-alkylene.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (IV e) are those compounds, wherein R5 and R'5, independently of one another, represent Ci-C4-alkyl, such as methyl or ethyl, or together form Ca-CA-alkylene, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene or 1,2-dimethylethylene or 2,2-dimethylpropylene, pr wherein Re, R7 and Fls; independently of one another, represent hydrogen or CrC4-alkyl, such as methyl or ethyl, and Rg represents Ci-C4-alkyl, or R7 and Rg together form Ca-Cs-alkylene, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene.<br><br>
tven more prererrea compounds or Tormuia (iv e) are compounds wherein R5 and R'5, independently of one another, represent Ci-Ca-alkyI, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, or wherein Re, R? and Re represent hydrogen, and R9 represents Ci-C4-alkyl.<br>
Most preferred compounds of formula (IV e) are compounds wherein R5 and R'5, independently of one another, represent Ci-Ca-alkyI, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, and wherein Re and Re represent hydrogen, and R? and Rg together form Ca-Cs-alkylene, such as ethylene or propylene.<br>
Especially preferred are the compounds of formula (IV e) that are specifically described in the working examples.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, reaction Step (a) can be combined with the formation of a compound of formula (II a) with the conventional oxidation of a corresponding hydroxymethyl derivative of formula<br><br>
with the conventional reduction of a corresponding derivatives of the carboxylic acid of formula<br><br><br>
wherein R4 represents, for example, hydroxy, Ci-Cr-alkoxy or halogen such as chloro; or with the conventional hydrolysis of an acetale of formula<br><br>
wherein R5 and R5', independently of one another, represent Ci-Cy-alkyI, such as methyl or ethyl, or together form C2-C4-alkylene, such as ethylene, propylene or butylene or 1,2-dimethylethylene.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to reaction Step (a), especially the reduction step of reductive amination. If the reaction is carried out, for example, with a borohydride and under basic conditions in a polar solvent, optionally, in the presence of water, preferably in a lower (especially anhydrous) alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or glyme, the resulting compound of formula (II c) or (II c'), respectively, can surprisingly be obtained in an essentially enantiomerically pure form. It is expected that under basic conditions, normally an at least partial racemisation will take place. In contrast to this, surprisingly, for example, an enantiomer excess (ee) of a compound of formula (II c) or (II c'), respectively, of s 95%, preferably s 98% and most preferably s 99% can be achieved.<br>
Step (a) is preferably carried out under mild conditions, especially in a temperature range of about -10°C to about room temperature, preferable in a range of about -5°C and +5°C.<br>
Step (b):<br>
In reaction Step (b). the acylation is carried out, for example, in absence or in presence of a suitable base.<br><br>
Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates, morpholine or piperidine amines, unsubstltuted or substituted pyridines, anilines, naphthalene amines, tri-CrCz-alkylamines, basic heterocycles or tetra-Ci-C7-alkyl-ammonium hydroxides. Examples, which may be mentioned, include sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, tri-propyl-amine, tri-butyl-amine or ethyldiisopropylamine, N-methyl-morpholine or N-methyl-piperidine, dimethyl-aniline or dimethylamino-naphthalene, a lutidine, a collldine, or benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide. A preferred base is a tri-CrC4-alkylamine such as ethyl-diisopropyl-amine or is pyridine.<br>
The acylation is carried out in a suitable inert solvent or in a mixture of solvents. The person skilled in the art is fully enabled to select a suitable solvent or solvent system. For example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, an ester such as ethylacetate or a mixture of ethylacetate and water, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, a nitrile such as acetonitrile of proprionitrile, an ether such as tetrahydrofurane or dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, amide such as dimethylformamide, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, is used as solvent.<br>
During the acylation of a compound of formula (II c), if R2 is hydrogen, the carboxyl-group might also be acylated forming a mixed anhydride. This intermediate is strongly prone to racemisation, mainly under basic conditions. Racemisation however can be avoided by first adding the compound of formula (II d), especially the halide, to the compound of formula (lie) in a suitable inert solvent (e.g. dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitril), then slowly adding a sub-stoichiometric amount of the base, especially pyridine, in relation to the compound of formula (II d). Small amounts of water in the reaction mixture, preferably two equivalents, may additionally suppress racemisation.<br>
The reaction can also be carried out by simultaneous or alternative addition of a compound of formula (II. d) and a basesuch .as pyridine J<eepina the reaction . mixture acidic at all times.></eepina>
The invention likewise relates to a compound of formula (II c), wherein Ri is hydrogen or a tetrazole protecting group and R2 is hydrogen or a carboxy<br><br>
protecting group, excluding a compound of formula (II c), wherein Ri Is ethyl and R2 is trityl; that can be used e.g. as intermediate for the manufacture of the compound of formula (I).<br>
The invention likewise relates to reaction Step (b). The resulting compound of formula (II e) can be obtained in an essentially enantiomerically pure form. For example, an enantiomer excess (ee) of a compound of formula (II c) or (II c'), respectively, of &gt; 95%, preferably s 98% and most preferably &gt; 99% can be achieved.<br>
If R2 represents a protecting group and Ri is hydrogen or a protecting group, for example, two equivalents of both a compound of formula (II d), e.g. the corresponding halide thereof, and a base, e.g. ethyl-diisopropyl-amine or tri-n-propylamine are added to a corresponding compound of formula (II e) dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g. toluene. Surprisingly, no racemisation is observed.<br>
Normally, in corresponding compounds of formula (II c), wherein R2 is hydrogen or a protecting group, one would expect at least partial racemisation, mainly in presence of base or acid and at elevated temperature. However, no racemisation is observed under the conditions applied according to this invention.<br>
Normally, in corresponding compounds of formula (II c), wherein R2 is hydrogen, one would expect a racemisation. However, in a presence of a base, no racemisation is observed.<br>
If Ri is hydrogen and R2 a protecting group, the tetrazole ring might also be acylated. When, however, the reaction mixture is quenched, for example with water or an alcohol such as methanol, the corresponding compound can be obtained wherein Ri is hydrogen.<br>
Compounds of formula (II d) are known or can be manufactured according to methods known per se.<br>
Step (c):<br><br>
The removal of the protecting groups, both the tetrazole and carboxy protecting group, can be carried out according to methods known per se in the art.<br>
For example, a benzylester can be converted into the corresponding acid especially by hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, A suitable catalyst comprises, for example, nickel, such as Raney nickel, and noble metals or their derivatives, for example oxides, such as palladium or platinum oxide, which may be applied, if desired, to support materials, for example to carbon or calcium carbonate. The hydrogenation may preferably be carried out at pressures between 1 and about 100 atm. and at room temperature between about -80° to about 200°C, in particular between room temperature and about 100°C.<br>
The removal of a trityl or tert-butyl group, respectively, can be achieved by treating corresponding protected compounds with an acid, especially under mild conditions.<br>
Step(d):<br>
The isolation Step (d) of a compound of formula (I) is carried out according to conventional isolation methods, such as by crystallizing the resulting compound of formula (I) from the reaction mixture - if desired or necessary after work-up, especially by extraction - or by chromatography of the reaction mixture.<br>
The conversion of an acid of formula (I) into a salt is carried out in a manner known per se. Thus, for example, a salt with a base of compounds of the formula (I) is obtained by treating the acid form with a base. Salts with a base can, on the other hand, be converted into the acid (free compound) in a customary manner, and salts with a base can be converted, for example, by treating with a suitable acid agent.<br>
