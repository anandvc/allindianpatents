REPUBLIC OF KOREA<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
[DESCRIPTION]<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a hollow fiber membrane module used for a water treatment, and more particularly, to a hollow fiber membrane module capable of preventing a bundle of hollow fiber membranes from being separated from a module case.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A water treatment for cleaning fluid by removing pollutants therefrom may use a heating method, a phase-changing method, or a separation method using a membrane.<br>
The separation method using a membrane has lots of advantages over the method based on heating or phase-changing. Among the advantages is high reliability of water treatment since the water purity required can be easily and stably satisfied by adjusting the size of the pores of a membrane. Furthermore, since the separation method using a membrane does not require a heating process, a membrane can be used with microorganism which is useful for separation process but may be adversely affected by heat.<br><br>
The separation membrane may include a flat-type membrane, and a hollow fiber membrane. In case of the hollow fiber membrane, there are micro-pores provided on a surface of tubular fiber structure, so that pollutants are filtered through the micro-pores included in the hollow fiber membrane. In comparison to the flat-type membrane, the hollow fiber membrane has the larger surface area owing to its inner and outer surfaces. Accordingly, owing to the advantageous characteristics such as the large surface area of hollow fiber membrane, the hollow fiber membrane is widely utilized for the separation membrane in the recent applications of water treatment.<br>
The hollow fiber membranes, which are manufactured as a predetermined-shaped module, are used for a water treatment field. A related art hollow fiber membrane module will be described as follows.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the related art hollow fiber membrane module.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the related art hollow fiber membrane module includes a bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes, and a module case 20.<br>
The bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes is formed by closely holding plural hollow fiber membranes 11 through the use of potting agent 13. At this time, one end of each of the plural hollow fiber membranes 11 is open so that water<br><br>
permeated through hollows of the hollow fiber membranes 11 is collected inside the module case 20. The potting agent 13 enables to form the bundle 10 by closely holding the plural hollow fiber membranes 11, and simultaneously to pot the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes into the inside of the module case 20 .<br>
The module case 2 0 accommodates the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes therein, and collects the water permeated through the hollow fiber membranes 11.<br>
However, the related art hollow fiber membrane module is disadvantageous in that the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes is apt to be separated from the module case 20 during a module-manufacturing process. In order to pot the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes into the inside of the module case 20, the plural hollow fiber membranes 11 are closely held into the bundle 10 through the use of potting agent 13; the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes is placed in the module case 20, and is filled with the potting agent 13; and the filled potting agent 13 is hardened. During the hardening process of the potting agent 13, the potting agent 13 might be expanded or shrunken, which cause a reduction of adhesive strength between the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes and the module case 20.<br>
Also, the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes may be separated from the module case 20 during a water-treatment<br><br>
process. In more detail, if carrying out the water-treatment process through the use of hollow fiber membrane module, the hollow fiber membrane module is submerged in water of a tank for a long period of time. In this case, the adhesive strength between the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes and the module case 20 may be reduced due to pressure inside the tank. Especially, when an aeration process for removing pollutants from the hollow fiber membranes 11 is carried out during the water-treatment process, the adhesive strength between the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes and the module case 20 may be reduced due to a vibration occurring during the aeration process.<br>
As mentioned above, if the adhesive strength is reduced between the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes and the module case 20, the bundle 10 of hollow fiber membranes may be separated from the module case 20, whereby the related art hollow fiber membrane module may malfunction.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a module case and a hollow fiber membrane module using the same, which is capable of preventing one or more problems of the related art.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a module case with a new structure capable of preventing the separation of a bundle of hollow fiber membranes, even though an adhesive strength therebetween is reduced, and a hollow fiber membrane module using the module case.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a module case for accommodating a bundle of hollow fiber membranes closely held together through the use of potting agent, comprises a first inner surface serving as a projection on which the bundle of hollow fiber membranes is stably placed; a second inner surface upwardly extending from one end of the first inner surface, the second inner surface including at least one separation-<br><br>
preventing groove to prevent the bundle of hollow fiber membranes from being separated from the module case; a third inner surface downwardly extending from the other end of the first inner surface; and a fourth inner surface connected to the third inner surface.<br>
At this time, the separation-preventing groove comprises an inlet provided on an extended surface of the second inner surface; and a room for defining the separation-preventing groove together with the inlet, wherein, on assumption that a width is defined with reference to a line parallel to the second inner surface, a width of the room is larger than a width of the inlet.<br>
The separation-preventing groove comprises a first inlet provided on an extended surface of the second inner surface; and a first room, a second inlet, and a second room sequentially arranged after the first inlet, wherein, on assumption that a width is defined with reference to a line parallel to the second inner surface, a width of the second room is larger than a width of the second inlet.<br>
The separation-preventing groove is formed from one end of the second inner surface to the other end of the second inner surface along a longitudinal direction of the hollow fiber membrane.<br>
The module case has a polygonal-shaped or curvilinear-shaped cross section when the module case is cut in a<br><br>
direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the hollow fiber membrane.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a hollow fiber membrane module comprises a module case comprising a first inner surface serving as a projection on which the bundle of hollow fiber membranes is stably placed, a second inner surface upwardly extending from one end of the first inner surface, the second   inner surface including at least one separation-preventing groove to prevent the bundle of hollow fiber membranes from being separated from the module case, a third inner surface downwardly extending from the other end of the first inner surface,  and a fourth inner surface connected to the third inner surface; a bundle of hollow fiber membranes closely held together through the use of first potting agent, the bundle of hollow fiber membranes being placed on the first inner surface of the module case; and a second potting agent for potting the bundle of hollow fiber membranes into the module case,  wherein the second potting agent is filled in the separation-preventing groove of the module case.<br>
The first potting agent may be in contact  with the first and second inner surfaces of the module case.<br>
The first potting agent may be in contact with the first and third inner surfaces of the module case.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
