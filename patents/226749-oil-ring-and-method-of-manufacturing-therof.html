				<td>OIL RING AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an oil ring for use in an internal combustion<br>
engine, and a method of manufacturing thereof, and more particularly, to the<br>
profile of the sliding surface of a two-piece oil ring, and machining thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As part of efforts to protect global environment, a greater improvement<br>
in vehicle fuel efficiency and a cleaner auto-emission have been strongly<br>
required. Therefore, friction reduction in internal combustion engine<br>
components and reduction in oil consumption have become critical issues. In<br>
solving these issues, piston rings play an important role. In designing a piston<br>
ring, it has been noted that lowering the tension of the piston ring is effective<br>
in reducing friction and that reducing the width of the piston ring is effective in<br>
reducing oil consumption. The width reduction is effective in that a smaller<br>
section modulus (Z) of a piston ring shows a better compatibility (movement<br>
to follow the cylinder wall), and thus improves oil consumption.<br>
Figs. 8A to 8C show cross sections of a typical piston ring structure in<br>
an internal combustion engine. Fig. 8A shows a cross section of a piston<br>
structure wherein a three-piece type oil ring is installed. Fig. 8B shows a cross<br>
section of a piston structure wherein a two-piece type oil ring is installed. Fig.<br>
8C shows a cross section of a two-piece type oil ring. In a piston 100, ring<br>
grooves 110, 120, and 130 for accommodating piston rings are formed. In<br>
these ring grooves, two compression rings 200, 210 mainly for gas sealing,<br>
and a combined oil ring 220 or 230 mainly for oil controlling and oil sealing<br>
are inserted. In accordance with the reciprocating motion of the piston 100,<br>
outer peripheral sliding surfaces of these rings slide with the inner wall of a<br>
cylinder 300.<br><br>
The combined oil ring 220 shown in Fig. 8A generally consists of three<br>
pieces; two side rails 222 arranged at its axially upper and lower portions, and<br>
a spacer-expander 224 assembled therebetween for pressing from inner<br>
periphery side of the side rails 222 to produce tension on the side rails 222.<br>
The combined oil ring 230 shown in Figs. 8B and 8C consists of two pieces; an<br>
oil ring body 234 having a pair of rail portions 232 arranged at its axially upper<br>
and lower portions, and a coil expander 236 assembled in the inner periphery<br>
of the oil ring body 234 for pressing the oil ring body 234 to produce tension.<br>
Regarding three-piece type oil rings, profiles of each part of<br>
three-piece type oil rings are described, for example, in JIS B 8032-13,<br>
"Internal combustion engines-Small diameter piston rings-Part 13:<br>
Expander/segment oil control rings," established on December 20, 1998,<br>
pages 3 to 5. Regarding two-piece type oil rings, profiles of each part of<br>
various kinds of two-piece type oil rings are described, for example, in JIS B<br>
8032-12, "Internal combustion engines-Small diameter piston rings-Part 12:<br>
Coil-spring-loaded oil control rings," established on December 20, 1998, pages<br>
2 to 11.<br>
In general, the profile of the sliding surface of the side rails 222 used<br>
for a three-piece type is barrel-shape or nearly semicircle as shown in Fig. 9A,<br>
and the profile of the sliding surface of the rail portions 232 used for a<br>
two-piece type is flat as shown in Fig. 9B (dimensions in the drawings are<br>
shown in mm). The reason is generally explained as follows.<br>
Due to the angle of the ear portion 224a of the spacer-expander 224<br>
that presses the side rails 222, the side rails 222 for the three-piece type are<br>
pressed with component forces in the radial direction toward the cylinder wall<br>
and in the axial direction toward upper and lower surfaces of the ring grooves.<br>
Therefore, the side rails 222 provide a good sealing with the cylinder wall and<br>
with upper and lower surfaces of the ring grooves. While in the two-piece<br>
type, the pressing direction of the coil expander 236 is only in the radial<br>
direction, thus the sealing with upper and lower surfaces of ring grooves is not<br><br><br>
enough. Therefore, oil scraping performance at the sliding surface becomes<br>
important, and thus the edge portions of the sliding surface have been made<br>
acute angles so that oil does not readily enter and oil films do not become<br>
thick.<br>
In addition, the upper and lower side rails 222 of the three-piece type<br>
can move independently, and can slide even though they are tilted to the axial<br>
direction in the ring groove. Therefore, even if an original sliding surface is<br>
made as flat, after a long time operation, the sliding surface wears out and<br>
becomes a curved surface, not flat surface, as shown in Fig. 9A. In contrast,<br>
the sliding surface of the rail portions 232 of the two-piece type is formed as a<br>
part of the oil ring body, and slides almost without tilting during operation, and<br>
thus the sliding surface has a flat surface as shown in Fig. 9B.<br>
In the Japanese utility model Laid-Open No. H05 (1993)-87366, the<br>
profile of the sliding surface of rail portions of a two-piece oil ring was<br>
discussed. It mentioned that, a problem arose if the cross section of the<br>
profile was nearly semicircle, because the contact area increased and contact<br>
pressure decreased as the sliding surface wore out due to the sliding with the<br>
cylinder inner wall. Therefore, in the Laid-Open, a sliding surface having a flat<br>
surface was proposed, in which the contact pressure did not vary even if it<br>
wore out.<br>
However, according to a recent study that measured and compared<br>
sliding friction of gasoline engines regarding a three-piece type oil ring and a<br>
two-piece type oil ring under the same tension conditions, it was found that the<br>
friction of the two-piece type was greater than that of the three-piece type. In<br>
other words, more friction reduction is strongly required for the two-piece type<br>
oil ring. Another problem to be noted here is that oil consumption increases if<br>
friction is reduced. Therefore, measures should be taken to reduce friction<br>
while considering the oil consumption issue.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an oil ring having an<br>
outstanding capability of reducing friction without increasing oil consumption, in<br><br>
other words, without impairing oil sealing capability.<br>
It is further an object of the invention to provide a two-piece oil ring<br>
having an outstanding capability of oil sealing and friction reduction, by<br>
improving the outer peripheral sliding surface of rail portions.<br>
It is further an object of the invention to provide a method of<br>
manufacturing oil rings which have an outstanding capability of reducing<br>
friction without impairing oil sealing capability.<br>
It is further an object of the invention to provide a piston structure using<br>
an oil ring which has an outstanding capability of oil sealing and friction<br>
reduction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The reason why the friction of the two-piece type is greater than that of<br>
the three-piece type is because the profile of the side rail sliding surface of the<br>
three-piece type is nearly semicircle that easily forms oil films in sliding against<br>
the cylinder, while the profile of the rail portion sliding surface of the two-piece<br>
type is flat that does not easily form oil films. Therefore, in the case of the<br>
two-piece type, the area in which fluid lubricates during combustion processes<br>
of an internal combustion engine becomes smaller (or become fewer) than that<br>
of the three-piece type. It is assumed that this increases total friction.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors conducted intensive studies for<br>
two-piece type oil rings in order to find suitable profiles of the rail portion sliding<br>
surface which easily form oil films. As a result, the inventors found that<br>
friction reduction can be improved without impairing oil sealing function by<br>
forming minute curved portions at both sides of the rail portion sliding surface.<br>
A two-piece oil ring according to the present invention comprises an<br>
annular oil ring body having a pair of rail portions formed at its axially upper<br>
and lower portions and butt ends (a cross-sectional cut at one location), and a<br>
coil expander assembled in the inner periphery side of the oil ring body. The<br>
outer peripheral sliding surface of each of the pair of rail portions comprises a<br><br>
nearly level flat region with a length of equal to or more than 0.05 mm in the<br>
center and curved regions extending on both sides of the flat region.<br>
Preferably, the flat region constitutes a range of equal to or more than 33% and<br>
less than 90% of the outer peripheral sliding surface. In addition, the oil ring<br>
according to the present invention comprises an annular oil ring body having a<br>
pair of rail portions arranged at its axially upper and lower portions and butt<br>
ends, and a coil expander assembled in the inner periphery side of the oil ring<br>
body, wherein the cross-sectional profile of the sliding region taken in the radial<br>
direction of the outer peripheral sliding surface of each of the rail portions<br>
comprises a nearly straight region with a length of equal to or more than 0.05<br>
mm in the center and two curved regions formed on both sides of the nearly<br>
straight region. Preferably, the nearly straight region constitutes a range of<br>
equal to or more than 33% and less than 90% of the sliding surface. More<br>
specifically, the radius of curvature of the curved region that contacts the<br>
near!y straight region is equal to or more than 3 mm when the curved region is<br>
measured under magnification 200 times in the axial direction and 2000 times<br>
in the radial direction.<br>
According to the present invention, both side parts of the outer<br>
peripheral sliding surface of the rail portion are made to be curved surfaces.<br>
With this structure, oil intake onto the sliding surface is enhanced by the<br>
wedging effect, and sliding hydraulic pressure is easily generated even at the<br>
oil intake portion because oil films become extremely thin, and therefore,<br>
friction can be reduced. The reason why the nearly straight region in the<br>
center of the outer peripheral sliding surface should have a length of equal to<br>
or more than 0.05 mm is because, if the nearly straight region has a length of<br>
less than 0.05 mm, the contact pressure becomes too high and thus friction<br>
reduction cannot be obtained. In other words, friction reduction cannot be<br>
obtained for the same reason if the nearly straight region is less than 33% of<br>
the sliding surface. In addition, if the nearly straight region is equal to or<br>
greater than 90% of the sliding surface, the curved regions are too short and<br><br>
thus friction reduction cannot be obtained.<br>
If the radius of curvature of the curved region that contacts the nearly<br>
straight region is equal to or more than 3 mm when the curved region is<br>
measured or observed under magnification 200 times in the axial direction and<br>
2000 times in the radial direction, friction reduction can be obtained because<br>
sliding hydraulic pressure is generated at the oil intake portion. However, if<br>
the radius of curvature of the curved region is less than 3 mm, friction<br>
reduction cannot be obtained because sliding hydraulic pressure is not easily<br>
generated at the oil intake portion. It is preferable that the radius of curvature<br>
of the curved region that contacts the nearly straight region be equal to or<br>
more than 5 mm.<br>
These are the characteristics of the profile of the curved region when it<br>
is measured or observed under magnification 200 times in the axial direction<br>
and 2000 times in the radial direction. In another way of explanation, the<br>
receding distance M of the curved region with respect to the imaginary straight<br>
line L that is drawn by extending the nearly straight region in the direction of<br>
the curved region is equal to or shorter than 1.5 micrometers for a distance of<br>
equal to or longer than 15 micrometers in the axial direction. If the receding<br>
distance M of the curved region exceeds 1.5 micrometers in a range within 15<br>
micrometers in the axial direction, sliding hydraulic pressure is not easily<br>
generated at oil intake portion, and thus friction cannot be reduced. It is<br>
preferable that the receding distance M of the curved region with respect to the<br>
imaginary straight line that is drawn by extending the nearly straight region in<br>
the direction of the curved region be equal to or shorter than 5 micrometers for<br>
a distance equal to or longer than 50 micrometers in the axial direction.<br>
A method of manufacturing an oil ring according to the present<br>
invention comprises the steps as follows. The method comprises the step of<br>
alternately stacking a plurality of oil ring bodies and annular spacers having a<br>
smaller diameter than the oil ring bodies, and then aligning and retaining them<br>
by using a jig such that the outer periphery of the oil ring bodies becomes a<br><br>
circle, and the step of pressing the outer peripheral sliding surface of the<br>
plurality of oil ring bodies by an elastic material through a film containing hard<br>
particles on its surface while rotating the aligned oil ring bodies to form a flat<br>
region that is nearly level with respect to the outer peripheral sliding surface<br>
and to form curved regions extending on both sides of the flat region.<br>
Preferably, the elastic material includes a urethane rubber. Also<br>
preferably, the hard particles include alumina particles or silicon carbide<br>
particles. More preferably, the method comprises the step of moving or<br>
oscillating the aligned oil ring bodies in the axial direction.<br>
Another manufacturing method according to the present invention<br>
comprises the step of alternately stacking a plurality of oil ring bodies and<br>
annular spacers having a smaller diameter than the oil ring bodies, and then<br>
aligning and retaining them by using a jig such that the outer periphery of the<br>
oil ring bodies becomes a circle, and the step of rotating the aligned oil ring<br>
bodies and forming a flat region that is nearly level with respect to the outer<br>
peripheral sliding surface of the plurality of oil ring bodies and forming curved<br>
regions extending on both sides of the flat region by using a buff or an elastic<br>
grindstone.<br>
Preferably, the profile machining of the outer peripheral sliding surface<br>
is performed by rotating the buff or elastic grindstone. In addition, the<br>
direction of the rotation of the buff or elastic grindstone may be orthogonal to<br>
the direction of the rotation of the jig. Alternatively, the direction of the rotation<br>
of the buff or elastic grindstone may be in parallel to the direction of the<br>
rotation of the jig.<br>
A piston structure according to the present invention comprises an oil<br>
ring having above-mentioned characteristics, a piston on which ring grooves<br>
are formed for accommodating at least the oil ring, and a cylinder in which a<br>
space is formed so that the piston is reciprocated therein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Referring to the attached drawings, embodiments of the present<br>
invention are now described. Figs. 1A to 1D show the outer peripheral sliding<br>
surface of a pair of rail portions formed on a two-piece oil ring body according<br>
to the present invention, taken in cross section in the radial direction. Fig. 1A<br>

An oil ring 1 according to the present invention comprises an oil ring<br>
body 10 having a pair of rail portions 12 formed at upper and lower portions in<br>
its axial direction and butt ends (not shown), and a coil expander 20<br>
assembled in inner periphery side of the oil ring body 10. In Figs. 1B, 1C, and<br>
1D, the outer peripheral sliding region of each of the rail portions 12 of the oil<br>
ring body 10 is designated by the letter f. The oil ring body 10 of the present<br><br>
invention is characterized in that the outer peripheral sliding region (f) has a<br>
nearly straight region (f1) in the center and two curved regions (f2) formed on<br>
both sides of the nearly straight region (f1). "B" portion shown in Fig. 1B is a<br>
part of the nearly straight region (f1), and a curved region (f2) extending<br>
therefrom.<br>
When the curved region (f2) is shown under magnification 200 times in<br>
the axial direction and 2000 times in the radial direction by using, for example,<br>
a profile measuring device, the radius of curvature r of the curved region (f2)<br>
can be relatively easily measured as shown in Fig. 1C. In the present<br>
invention, as a way of determining the curved region (f2), the curved region (f2)<br>
is determined by the radius of curvature of the curved region under<br>
magnification 200 times in the axial direction and 2000 times in the radial<br>
direction, wherein the radius of curvature is designated as r. In another<br>
determining way, as shown in Fig. 1D, an imaginary straight line L is drawn by<br>
extending the straight region (f1) in the direction of the curved region (f2), and<br>
the receding distance M of the curved region with respect to the imaginary<br>
straight line L is determined by the relation with the axial distance of the curved<br>
region (f2), wherein f2 = (f - f1) / 2. In Fig. 1D, the effective region of the<br>
curved region (f2) is the region starting at point E that contacts the nearly<br>
straight region (f1) and ending at point J, although there is another region<br>
ending at point K that does not appear in Fig. 1C under magnification 200<br>
times in the axial direction and 2000 times in the radial direction. However,<br>
the region between the points J and K has little effect on friction reduction<br>
because the receding distance M in the region with respect to the imaginary<br>
straight line L becomes large.<br>
As mentioned above, by forming a flat region (f1) in the center and<br>
curved regions (f2), extending on both sides of the flat region, on the outer<br>
peripheral sliding surface (f) of the rail portions 12 of the oil ring body 10,<br>
friction with the inner wall of the cylinder can be reduced as mentioned later<br>
without increasing oil consumption.<br><br>
Figs. 2A and 2B are schematic diagrams to explain the method of<br>
manufacturing a two-piece oil ring according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 2A, the structure of upper half of the assembled oil<br>
ring bodies is shown in cross section. An oil ring machining device 30 has a<br>
jig 40, wherein one end of the jig 40 is connected to a rotation device 42 and<br>
another end is supported by a bearing 44, and the jig 40 is rotated by the<br>
rotation device 42.<br>
A plurality of oil ring bodies 10 and annular spacers 14 (also called<br>
distance collars by those skilled in the art), each having a smaller diameter<br>
than the oil ring bodies, are alternately stacked on the jig 40, and the butt ends<br>
are retained such that the outer periphery of the oil ring bodies 10 becomes a<br>
circle. By mounting the oil ring bodies 10 after their outer periphery is aligned<br>
as mentioned, the oil ring bodies 10 can be collectively machined. In order to<br>
form the curved regions (f2) on both ends of the outer peripheral sliding<br>
surface of the rail portions 12, the assembled oil ring bodies 10 are rotated by<br>
the rotation device 42, and a film 48 on the surface of which hard particles are<br>
distributed is interposed between the assembled oil ring bodies 10 and a<br>
urethane rubber 46, and then pressure is applied for grind machining. For the<br>
hard particles, alumina or silicon carbide which are generally used as<br>
abrasives can be used.<br>
Both of the radius of curvature r of the curved region (f2) under<br>
magnification 200 times in the axial direction and 2000 times in the radial<br>
direction, and the receding distance M with respect to the imaginary straight<br>
line L wherein the axial distance of the curved region (f2) is obtained by the<br>
equation, f2 = (f - f1) / 2, can be controlled appropriately by varying machining<br>
time, the grain size of the hard particles, the hardness of the urethane rubber,<br>
or the amount of the applied pressure. In addition, by moving the jig 40 to the<br>
axial direction and oscillating the assembled oil ring bodies 10, the machining<br>
of the outer peripheral sliding surface can be done in a shorter time. In the<br>
assembled oil ring bodies 10, by making the distance S1 between the rail<br><br>
portions 12 equal to the width S2 of the spacer 14 (or the distance between the<br>
rail portions 12 that straddle a spacer 14), the outer peripheral sliding region of<br>
each rail can be machined symmetrically. To the contrary, the outer peripheral<br>
sliding region can be machined asymmetrically by changing the width S2 of the<br>
annular spacers.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B are schematic diagrams to explain the method of<br>
manufacturing a two-piece oil ring according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, wherein the structure of the upper half of the assembled oil<br>
ring bodies is shown in cross section. A machining device according to the<br>
present embodiment performs machining by using a buff or an elastic<br>
grindstone 50 to form curved regions on both ends of the outer peripheral<br>
sliding surface of the rail portions. In the drawings, like parts are identified by<br>
the same reference numerals as in Figs. 2A and 2B. In Fig. 3A, an example<br>
is shown where the rotation axis of the buff or elastic grindstone 50 is<br>
orthogonal to the rotation axis of the jig 40. In this case, machining can be<br>
performed by moving or oscillating the buff or elastic grindstone 50 in the<br>
direction of the axis of the jig 40.<br>
In Fig. 3B, an example is shown where the rotation axis of the buff or<br>
elastic grindstone 52 is in parallel to the rotation axis of the jig 40. Also in this<br>
case, machining can be performed by moving or oscillating the buff or elastic<br>
grindstone 52 in the direction of the axis of the jig 40.<br>
Preferred embodiments<br>
From a wire-rod of martensitic stainless steel having a predetermined<br>
profile, two-piece oil ring bodies each having a nominal diameter of 86 mm,, a<br>
width of 2 mm, and a thickness of 2 mrrrwere formed. On the two-piece oil<br>
ring bodies, machining such as outer peripheral lapping, butting end face<br>
grinding, and side surface grinding were performed. A plurality of samples<br>
were manufactured wherein the width (the length in the axial direction) of the<br>
outer peripheral sliding surface of rail portions were made in a range of 0.15 to<br><br>
0.30 mm.<br>
These two-piece oil ring bodies and annular spacers each having a<br>
smaller diameter than the oil ring bodies were stacked alternately, and both<br>
ends were retained by using a jig so that the outer periphery of the oil ring<br>
bodies became a circle. At that time, the width of the annular spacers was<br>
chosen so that the distances between the rails of the assembled oil ring bodies<br>
were equal. The assembled oil ring bodies were rotated at 1500 rpm by a<br>
rotation device. A film having a width of 50 mm on which alumina particles of<br>
#1000 were distributed was interposed between the assembled oil ring bodies<br>
and a urethane rubber roller having a Shore hardness of 70 HS, and they were<br>
pressed under a load of 100N so that abrasive machining was performed to<br>
form curved regions on both ends of the sliding region of the rail portions. At<br>
that time, for some samples, oscillating motion with a width of 1 mm per 30<br>
rpm was applied to obtain larger curved regions.<br>
The profiles of the curved regions can be controlled by varying, for<br>
example, machining time or contact pressures. The profiles of the curved<br>
regions of the samples were classified into three groups according to the<br>
radius of curvature of the curved region under magnification 200 times in the<br>
axial direction and 2000 times in the radial direction. The three groups were;<br>
the profiles whose radius of curvature r were equal to or less than 2 mm<br>
(samples for comparison), 3 to 4 mm, and 5 to 9 mm (samples of the<br>
embodiments). The radius of curvature of 3 mm corresponds to 15<br>
micrometers in the axial direction and 1.5 micrometers in the radial direction.<br>
Similarly, the radius of curvature of 5 mm corresponds to 50 micrometers in the<br>
axial direction and 5 micrometers in the radial direction. In addition, the<br>
samples whose sliding region of rail portions had only nearly straight region<br>
were also manufactured as samples of conventional approach for comparison.<br>
Sliding friction test<br>
The evaluation of sliding friction for the above-mentioned various<br><br>
profiles of sliding region of rail portions was performed by using a sliding<br>
friction tester. The test was performed with a single model in which only an oil<br>
ring was installed in a piston which was reciprocated in a cylinder. Fig. 4<br>
shows a cross-sectional schematic view of the tester. The tester was a single<br>
cylinder having a bore diameter of 86 mm and a stroke of 40 mm. A piston 62<br>
was reciprocated in a cylinder 60 whose upper part is opened, with no<br>
pressure being applied. Sliding friction was detected by three piezo type<br>
washer load sensors 64. Sliding friction was evaluated by the Friction Mean<br>
Effective Pressure (FMEP). The Friction Mean Effective Pressure is<br>
expressed as pressure and calculated by dividing the integral of the friction<br>
during the reciprocating motion in two rotations by the piston displacement.<br>
The operation was conducted at 600 rpm under the condition where adequate<br>
amount of low viscosity oil as a lubricant was dropped from above the cylinder,<br>
wherein the low viscosity oil was at a level of 6 centistokes at 30 degrees<br>
centigrade, and the bore temperature in the stroke center portion was<br>
controlled at 30 degrees centigrade.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph that shows the results of the above-mentioned sliding<br>
friction test under the same tension condition, and shows the relationship<br>
between the length of the nearly straight region (f1) of the outer peripheral<br>
sliding region of the rail portion and the Friction Mean Effective Pressure<br>
thereof. Also shown in the graph are the results for the samples of<br>
conventional approach whose outer peripheral sliding region of the rail portion<br>
have only the nearly straight region (f) and do not have curved regions,<br>
wherein (f) is shown on the horizontal axis as in the case with (f1). In the<br>
graph, the length of the nearly straight region (f1) and the.value of the Friction<br>
Mean Effective Pressure of the sliding region of a typical rail portion of<br>
conventional approach are each defined as 1, and relative values are shown.<br>
In addition, the Friction Mean Effective Pressure of 0.73 of a typical three-piece<br>
type oil ring under the same tension is also shown by a dashed line.<br>
As is evident from the graph, it is shown also by the sliding friction test<br><br>
that the friction of the two-piece type is higher than that of the three-piece type.<br>
Also shown in the graph is that even with the profile whose outer peripheral<br>
sliding region of the rail portion has only the nearly straight region (f) and does<br>
not have curved regions, the friction can be reduced down to a similar level to<br>
that of the three-piece type, by enlarging the sliding region (f). It can be<br>
considered that this is because if the sliding region (f) becomes larger, the<br>
contact pressure of the sliding surface reduces, which increases oil film<br>
thickness. However, it can adversely increase oil consumption.<br>
According to the present invention, regarding the samples whose<br>
radius of curvature of the curved region r are 3 to 4 mm and 5 to 9 mm<br>
(samples of the embodiments) under magnification 200 times in the axial<br>
direction and 2000 times in the radial direction, it was observed that the friction<br>
was decreased when the length of the nearly straight region (fl) was longer<br>
than 0.05 mm even if the length of the nearly straight region (f1) was smaller<br>
than that of conventional approach, which is defined as 1. It can be<br>
considered that this is because sliding hydraulic pressure was generated in the<br>
curved regions of the present invention that behave as oil intake portions.<br>
Regarding the samples whose radius of curvature of the curved region were<br>
equal to or less than 2 mm (samples for comparison) under magnification 200<br>
times in the axial direction and 2000 times in the radial direction, the friction<br>
was almost unchanged when the length of the nearly straight region (f1) was<br>
same as that of conventional approach, and the friction became greater when<br>
the nearly straight region (f1) was shorter than conventional approach.<br>
Fig. 6 is a graph that shows the relationship between the contact<br>
pressure applied on the nearly straight regions (f1 or f) on the horizontal axis<br>
and the Friction Mean Effective Pressure, based on the data shown in Fig. 5.<br>
As shown in the graph, regarding the samples whose radius of curvature r of<br>
the curved region were 3 to 4 mm and 5 to 9 mm (samples of the<br>
embodiments) under magnification 200 times in the axial direction and 2000<br>
times in the radial direction, it can be seen that the friction was reduced even if<br><br>
the contact pressure was greater than the sample of conventional approach<br>
whose contact pressure is defined as 1.0.<br>
Oil consumption test<br>
To assess oil sealing function of a two-piece oil ring according to the<br>
present invention, oil consumption test was conducted by using a 2.5-liter<br>
gasoline engine. Fig. 7 shows typical test results under a driving condition<br>
that is equivalent to the driving at 100 km/h. In the case of the two-piece oil<br>
ring according to the present invention, if the length of outer peripheral sliding<br>
region (f) of the rail portions that includes curved regions was same as that of<br>
the nearly straight region (f) of conventional approach, oil consumption under<br>
the same tension condition was equivalent to that of the conventional approach.<br>
It can be assumed that the reason why the equivalent oil consumption was<br>
obtained was because, by providing the sliding region of the rail portions which<br>
comprises a nearly straight region (f1) in the center and curved regions {12) on<br>
both sides of the straight region, the influence of increasing oil consumption<br>
due to the enhancement of oil introduction at the curved regions was cancelled<br>
by the influence of reducing oil consumption that is caused because contact<br>
pressure of the nearly straight region in the center became higher.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, by making the<br>
outer peripheral sliding region of the rail portions of an oil ring body such that<br>
the outer peripheral sliding region comprises a nearly straight region with a<br>
length equal to or more than 0.05 mm in the center, when viewed from the<br>
cross section of its radial direction, and two curved regions on both sides of the<br>
straight region, oil intake onto the sliding surface is enhanced by the wedging<br>
effect, and sliding hydraulic pressure is easily generated even at the oil intake<br>
portions because oil films become extremely thin. As a result, friction can be<br>
reduced. In addition, if the sliding region is not greater than that of the<br>
conventional approach, the influence of increasing oil consumption due to the<br>
enhancement of oil introduction at the curved regions is cancelled by the<br><br>
influence of reducing oil consumption that is caused because the contact<br>
pressure of the nearly straight region in the center becomes higher, and thus<br>
friction can be reduced without increasing oil consumption.<br><br>
