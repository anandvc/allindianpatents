Intermediate Production Example 1<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 5.0 g of 4-(benzyloxy)phenol and 100 ml of carbon tetrachloride, to which a solution 5.43 g of t-butyl hypochlorite dissolved in 5 ml of carbon tetrachloride was slowly added dropwise, while stirring under ice cooling. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by phase separa¬tion. The organic layer (1.e., carbon tetrachloride layer) was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 4.24 g of 2,4-dichloro-4-(benzyloxy)phenol (63% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 5.10 g of 1,3-dibromopropane, 2.40 g of potassium carbonate and 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, to which a solution of 4.24 g of 2,6-dichloro-4-(benzyloxy)phenol dissolved in 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide was slowly added dropwise. After stirring at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted twice with 150 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 4.24 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-bromopropyloxy)-l-(benzyloxy)benzene (68% yield).<br>
