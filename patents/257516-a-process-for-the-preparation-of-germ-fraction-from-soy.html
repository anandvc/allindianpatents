				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of germ fraction from soy.<br>
Due to the potential role of soy foods in preventing and treating chronic diseases, there has been an upsurge in our interest in soybeans and soy products in recent years. Increasing evidence has suggested that the isoflavones in soybeans might be the contributing factors (Akiyama et al, Genestein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinase. J. Biol. Chem. 262:5592-5595,1987; Adiercreutz et al, Dietary phytoestrogens and cancer: in vitro and in vivo studies. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 41:331-337, 1992; Cassidy et al. Biological effects of a diet of soy protein rich in isoflavones on the men'strual cycle of premenopausal women. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 60:333, 1994; Anthony et al.. Soybean isoflavones improve cardiovascular risk factors without affecting the reproductive system of prepubertal Rhesus monkeys. J. Nutr. 126:43,1996). Total isoflavone content in the tested soybean varieties ranged from 1.261-3.886 mg/g seed (Wang and Murphy, isoflavone composition of American and Japanese soybeans in Iowa: effects of variety, crop year and location. J. Agric. Food Chem. 42:1674-1677, 1994).<br>
Generally, soy germ called hypocotyl axis constitutes about i % of soybeans and reported to contain 5.5-6 times higher amount of isoflavones than that in cotyledons and about 10% less fat (Kudou et al, Malonyl isoflavone glucosides in soybean seeds {Glycine max Merrill), Agric. Biol. Chem 55:2227-2233, 1991; Wolf and Cowan, (Ed.), Soybeans as a food source, CRC Press, Cleveland, OH, 1975). Hence there is a potential for a new use of the germs. Axis also has a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic) and lowest relative percentage of oleic and stearic acids (Liu et al, Fatty acid composition within each structural part and section of a soybean seed, J. Agric. Food Chem., 43:381-383, 1995). Isoflavones are shown to possess antioxidant, antifungal activity and anticarcinogens (Naim et al, Antioxidative and antihemolytic activities of soybean isoflavones, J. Agric. Food Chem. 24:1174-1177, 1976; Pratt and Birac, Source of antioxidant activity of soybean and soy products, J. Food Sci. 44:1720-1722, 1979; Fleury et al. Soybean (malonyl) isoflavones characterization and antioxidant properties, in Plienolic compounds in food and tlieir effects on<br><br>
health, Vol II, Huang et al (Ed.) pp. 98-113, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, 1992; Bartholomew and Ryan, Lack of mutagenecity of some phytoestrogens in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay, Mutat. Res. 78:317-320, 1980; Verdeal et al. Affinity of phytoestrogens for estrodial binding proteins and effect of coumesterol on growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz-(a)anthracene induced rat mammary tumors, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 64:285-290, 1980).<br>
On the other hand, Isoflavones are shown to be partially responsible for an objectionable after taste with soy foods. It is speculated that the soy hypocotylaxis/germ is the source of the beany flavor and undesirable taste in soy products (Soybeans- Chemistry, Technology and Utilization, edited by KeShun Liu, ITP Pub. P 95, 1997). Hence there is a need to reduce the off flavor by removing the hypocotyls during processing (Tsukamoto et al, A process for the removal of glyocosides during tofu production and an evaluation of the marketability of the final product. In Japan part of Proceedings of the International Conference on Soybean Processsing and Utilisation, K. Okubo (Ed), pp. 47-5,1991). More recently, it is reported on ways of preparing products with soybean hypocotyls retaining isoflavones and having good flavor [Tsuzaki et al., (1999) Roasted soybean hypocotyls and beverage material containing the same, US patent #5,872,410].<br>
Hence, considering the fact that isoflavone concentration in the hypocotyls is about 5-6 times higher than in cotyledons, there is a potential for a new use of the soybean axis (Soybeans- Chemistry, Technology and Utilization, edited by KeShun Liu, ITP Pub. 1997). During soybean processing, after cracking the beans, the axis may be separated with the cotyledons or with the hull depending on which structural part it adheres to. Because of the low proportion of hypocotyls axis in the whole seed and difficulty in separating it from the other parts commercially, relatively few studies have been conducted on its food value. Presently, hypocotyls are disposed along with hulls without separating from the cotyledons, which may be used as feed material.<br>
Presently, 10-40% isoflavone extract concentrations of soy are available in the market. It is evident that there is demand for isoflavone rich product. The<br><br>
product in the present study makes a very good starting material for the preparation of isoflavone rich extract.<br>
A few processes available for the separation of germ fraction from soy are described.<br>
Reference may be made to KeShun Liu, (1997) [Soybeans- Chemistry, Technology and Utilization, edited by, ITP Pub., pp. 300-301], where It is mentioned that commercially, cracking followed by dehulling is employed for soy beans. The hulls are separated from the cotyledons by aspiration and then the meats are separated by size followed by aspiration for removing the fines. Here the fines are either included with the meats or aspirated. There is no mention of hypocotyledons/germs being separated during the process.<br>
Reference can also be made to Woerfel, (1995a) and Snyder and Kwon (1987) [Extraction. Ch.6 In Practical Handbook of Soybean Processing and Utilisation, D.R. Ericson (Ed.), p. 161-173. AOCS press. Champaign, IL] for Hot dehulling of soy beans where the seeds are heated prior to dehulling followed by cracking resulting in better hull separation compared to conventional dehulling. Here again there is no mention of separation of hypocotyledons from the dehulled material.<br>
Reference may be made to Tsuzaki et al., (1999) [Roasted soybean hypocotyls and beverage material containing the same, US patent # 5,872,410] which refers to the invention of providing a beverage material having roasted soybean hypocotyls which are free of cotyledons, with the material retaining active ingredients such as isoflavone and good flavor. The process Involves drying the beans to 12% or less moisture, heating the dried bean to 70C or higher, breaking and hulling the soy beans using a roll or a grinder with a plurality of grind stones spaced away wider than the diameter of the beans and separation of the hypocotyls by sieving and aspiration. It is not mentioned here about the yield or the purity of germ obtained by the process.<br><br>
Reference may be made to Doi et a!., (1989) [Process for the manufacture of packed soybean curd, US patent # 4,828,869], which refers to a process for preparing packed asceptic soybean curd by thermally treating dehulled and hypocotyls-removed soybeans with superheated steam. It is not mentioned here either the way of removing the hypocotyls from the mixture of dehulled material or the yield of hypocotyls in the process.<br>
Reference may be made to Rao et al., (1976) [Fractionation of the whole wheat kernel by pin milling, US patent # 3,979,375], which refers to a process for fractionating the whole wheat kernel into its bran, germ and endosperm components including the steps of tempering in water, pin milling the wheat kernel, ie., by impact milling, sifting the milled material to separate the germs and bran components from the endosperm.<br>
Reference may be made to Posner et al., (1991) [Method of separating wheat germ from whole wheat, US patent # 4,986,997]. Process provides recovery of substantial quantities of wheat embryo and scutellum, to increase the yield of premium germ. The process involves initial tempering followed by impact scouring to remove intact embryo.<br>
Reference cannot be made to many other inventions, as there is no mention of the details of processing for separation of the hypocotyls from cotyledons and the yield and purity of hypocotyls or germs using the process.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for separating the germ fraction from soybeans during dehulling of the beans and achieving a yield of 95-100%.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide A process for separation of germ fraction from soy.<br>

The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of germ fraction from soy.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for producing a germ fraction rich in isoflavone content.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process for producing a germ fraction free from cotyledons and hulls<br>
Another object is to obtain maximum yield of germs from the mixture of dehulled material containing cotyledons, hulls and germs<br>
Accordingly, a process for the preparation of germ fraction from soy comprising;<br>
a)	soaking the said beans by adding water for a period ranging 10-15 min,<br>
b)	drying the soaked soy at a temperature ranging from 70-90°C for a period of 3-6 hrs to obtain a moisture level of 8-10%,<br>
c)	dehulling the dried soy to obtain the soy fractions,<br>
d)	sieving the fractions using 12 and 14 mesh sieves,<br>
e)	shearing the fraction obtained in 12 mesh to remove remaining germs from the hulls<br>
f)	sieving the above obtained material using shearing machine on 12 and 14 mesh screens to separate the germ fraction,<br>
g)	air classifying the above material to obtain pure germ fraction.<br>
In an embodiment of the process the germ fraction obtained is in the range of 95-100%.<br>
In an another embodiment of the process the germ fraction purity is in the range 93-96%.<br>
In an another embodiment of the process the germ fraction has<br><br>
Fraction	Percentage<br>
isoflavon	0.64-1.23%,<br>
saponin	19-20%<br>
fat	10-12.8%<br>
protein	38-45%.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the process the the germ fraction obtained is used in food and pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Novelty:<br>
Novelty and inventive steps of this invention lies in the fact that a new process is developed for the preparation of a pure germ fraction having maximum isoflavone content and minimum fat content by way of maximum yield of germs with minimum contamination of cotyledons<br>
The novelty of the formulation and the process is that a maximum yield of germ fraction is obtained, rich in isoflavone and having low fat content using the following steps:<br>
&gt;	Moisture content of 8-10% during dehulling.<br>
&gt;	Use of size separator for separation of the germs that are loosened during dehulling<br>
&gt;	Use of shearing technique for the separation of the remaining germs adhering to the hulls to get a better yield of germs<br>
&gt;	Use of size separator again for removing the separated germs from the sheared hulls<br>
&gt;	Finally separating the germs from the hulls by air classification<br>
&gt;	The process gives germ fraction with a purity around 95%<br>
&gt;       The process also gives 95-100% yield of gemris<br>
Pre-cleaned and graded soybeans were the raw material taken for conditioning and processing further for germ separation. The composition of the raw material taken for processing was:<br>
Hull content in the whole beans	7.84%<br>
Germ content in the dehulled beans...2.43%<br>
Moisture in the cotyledons	9.5%<br>
Moisture content in the germ	9.07%<br>
Fat content in the cotyledons	19.85%<br>
Fat content in the germ	10.45%<br>
Isofavone content in dehulled bean	0.22%<br>
Isofavone content in germ	1.22%<br>
Purity of the germs is calculated based on the fact that hypocotyledons/ germ contain roughly half of the fat content present in the cotyledons. Hence it is obvious that when the fat content in the present product is more than that of the pure germ fraction, there is contamination of the germ portion with the cotyledons. This is also true when the isoflavone content is lower than that in the pure germ. So, to that extent the purity of the germ is affected when there is contamination of the germ with the cotyledons. As for the yield, when hypocotyls/germs content in the dehulled bean is known, the yield of germ can be estimated based on the fat / isoflavone content in the material.<br>
The process is further illustrated by the examples given below, which should not however be construed to limit the scope of the invention<br>

The material retained on 12 mesh is then passed through a shearing machine (Ribbon mixer) for shearing off the germs sticking to the hulls. The sheared material is once again passed through 12 &amp; 14 mesh sieves for separation of germs from the sheared hulls followed by air classification for removal of hulls from the mixture.
