				<td>Technical Field •4<br>
The present invention generally relates to electric machines that are used to<br>
provide electrical power. In particular, the present invention relates to<br>
alternators of the type that are used in vehicles to provide electrical power for<br>
running accessories and charging batteries.<br>
Background Art<br>
Many prior art alternators utilize excitation windings that are positioned on the<br>
alternator rotor. Such a configuration limits the number of possible ways that<br>
permanent magnets can be positioned on the rotor. Furthermore, such<br>
configurations typically utilize brushes which increase manufacturing costs and<br>
create problems relating to brush wear and replacement.<br>
Other prior art alternators use excitation windings attached to the stator with a<br>
magnetic circuit closed outside the rotor. Such a prior art configuration is known<br>
in the art as a Lundell brushless magnetic circuit.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a novel alternator wherein only permanent<br>
magnets are positioned on the rotor. The excitation windings are not positioned<br>
on the rotor but instead, are attached to the interior of the alternator housing.<br>
Such a configuration results in a brushless alternator. Several important<br>
features of the alternator of the present invention are:<br>
1) both permanent magnets and excitation windings are utilized to produce a<br>
combined and controllable variable flux in the stator windings (the induced<br>
stator);<br>
-2-<br>
2) brushes are not required thereby eliminating the aforementioned problems associated<br>
with brushes;<br>
3) an induced magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets and an induced<br>
magnetic field produced by the excitation windings have a common magnetic path only inside<br>
the stator, i.e. the magnetic flux produced by the excitation windings does not pass through<br>
the permanent magnet, and the magnetic flux produced by the magnets does not form a loop<br>
surrounding the excitation windings;<br>
«•..<br>
4) the flux path of the excitation winding magnetic circuit is perpendicular to the flux<br>
path of the permanent magnet circuit everywhere except in the induced stator; and<br>
5) the flux produced by the excitation windings passes only through two air gaps<br>
compared to four in the brushless Lundell-type alternator.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a brushless electric machine, comprising<br>
a housing fabricated from a magnetically permeable material and having an interior region, a<br>
stator mounted within the interior region and attached to the housing wherein the stator has a<br>
stator winding, a rotor mounted for rotation about a rotational axis within the stator wherein<br>
the rotor comprises a plurality of magnetic pole pieces and permanent magnets<br>
circumferentially arranged in an alternating configuration such that each permanent magnet is<br>
positioned intermediate a pair of consecutive magnetic pole pieces and the axis of<br>
magnetization lies in the plane of rotation of the rotor. The rotor is separated from the stator<br>
windings by a first air gap so as to form a first magnetic circuit. The rotor further comprises a<br>
first side, a first rotor end cap attached to the first side, a second side, and a second rotor end<br>
cap attached to the second side. Each rotor end cap contacting at least some of the magnetic<br>
pole pieces. Each rotor end cap is fabricated from a magnetically permeable material. The<br>
brushless electric machine further comprises a pair of excitation windings. Each excitation<br>
winding is secured to the housing on either side of the rotor such that the excitation winding .<br>
extends circumferentially in the plane of rotation of the rotor and about a corresponding rotor<br>
end cap. The excitation windings are separated from the rotor end caps by a s.econd air gap.<br>
The first and second air gaps cooperate to form a second magnetic circuit.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a brushless electric machine,<br>
comprising a housing fabricated from a magnetically permeable material and having an<br>
interior region, a stator mounted within the interior region and attached to the housing<br>
wherein the stator has a stator winding, and a rotor mounted for rotation about a rotational<br>
axis and spaced apart from the stator windings by an air gap. The rotor comprises a pair of<br>
magnetically permeable claw poles. Each claw pole comprises a body portion having a<br>
circumference and fingers that extend axially from the circumference of the body portion and<br>
intermesh with the fingers of the other claw pole. The rotor further comprises a plurality of<br>
permanent magnets and a plurality of internal pole pieces intermediate the claw poles and<br>
circumferentially arranged in an alternating configuration such that each permanent magnet is<br>
positioned intermediate a pair of consecutive internal pole pieces. The arrangement of the<br>
permanent magnets and internal pole pieces define an outer rotor perimeter and a central<br>
opening for receiving a shaft about which the rotor rotates. The plurality of internal pole<br>
pieces comprise a first group of internal pole pieces that are attached to one of the claw poles<br>
and a second group of internal pole pieces that are attached to the other claw pole,. The claw<br>
poles are magnetically isolated from the permanent magnets. The fingers of each claw pole<br>
are intermediate the stator and the outer rotor perimeter. The brushless electric machine<br>
further comprises a pair of excitation windings. Each excitation winding is secured to the<br>
housing on either side of the rotor such that the excitation winding extends circumferentially<br>
in the plane of rotation of the rotor. The excitation windings are separated from the claw<br>
poles by an air gap.<br>

Mode For Carrying Out The Invention<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown brushless hybrid alternator 10 of the present<br>
invention. Alternator 10 generally comprises housing 12, stator section 13 and a rotor<br>
section, generally indicated by numeral 14. Air gap 15 separates stator section 13 and rotor<br>
section 14. In one embodiment, housing 12 is fabricated from magnetically permeable<br>
material. Stator section 13 is attached to the interior wall of housing 12 and has stator<br>
winding 13a. Alternator 10 includes shaft 16 which rotates about axis 18. Rotor section 14 is<br>
mounted to shaft 16. Thus, rotor section 14 rotates with respect to stator section 13. Rotor<br>
section 14 comprises a substantially cylindrical center section 20, rotor end cap 22, and rotor<br>
end cap 24. In one embodiment of a six pole configuration, center section 20 generally<br>
comprises six (6) magnetic pole pieces 26a-26f (see Fig. 2) and six (6) permanent magnets<br>
28a-28f arranged in an alternate fashion as shown in FIG. 2. Magnetic pole pieces 26a-26f<br>
are fabricated from magnetically permeable materials. In one embodiment, permanent<br>
magnets 28a-28f are configured as ferrite magnets. In another embodiment, permanent<br>
magnets 28a-28f are configured as rare earth magnets. It is to be understood that although the<br>
foregoing description is in terms of six poles, there can be less than or more<br>
than six poles.<br>
Jk has been technically proved that a relatively high-power alternator can be<br>
realized by maximizing the magnetic flux that is crossing air gap 15. This<br>
concept is embodied within the design of the alternator of the present invention<br>
as will be apparent from the ensuing description. Housing 12 comprises two<br>
halves or portions 15A and 15B that are separated by space 15C. The purpose<br>
of this particular housing structure will be apparent from the ensuing<br>
description. Housing 12 comprises two halves or portions 15A and 15B that are<br>
separated by space 15C. The purpose of this particular housing structure will<br>
be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, rotor end caps 22 and 24 are identically constructed and<br>
are fabricated from a magnetically permeable material. Rotor end caps 22 and<br>
24 are positioned on opposite sides of center portion 20 and circumferentially<br>
shifted with respect to each other by one pole pitch. End cap 22 includes<br>
portions 22a and 22b. Portion 22a is attached to rotor center portion 20 and<br>
contacts a predetermined number of magnetic poles pieces 26a-26f and<br>
permanent magnets 28a-28f. Portion 22b is spaced apart from rotor section 14<br>
and circumferentially extends about shaft 16. Similarly, cap 24 includes portions<br>
24a and 24b.<br>
Portion 24a is attached to center portion 20 and contacts a predetermined<br>
number of magnetic poles pieces 26a-26f and permanent magnets 28a-28f.<br>
Portion 24b is spaced apart from rotor section 14 and circumferentially extends<br>
about shaft 16. The entire rotor section 14 (i. e. center section 20 and end caps<br>
22,24) rotates inside of housing 12.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, alternator 10 further includes excitation windings 30,32.<br>
Excitation windings 30,32 comprise circular coils that are wound on lip portions<br>
12a, 12b, respectively, of the interior wall of housing 12 and thus, do not rotate.<br>
Windings 30 and 32 circumferential extend about rotor end cap portions 24b<br>
and 22b, respectively. Windings 30 and 32 produce a second magnetic circuit<br>
for rotor 14. (Windings 30,32 lie in the plane of FIG. 2 but are only shown in<br>
FIG. 1.) Winding 30 is separated from end cap portion 24a by axial air gap 33a.<br>
Similarly, winding 32 is separated from end cap portion 22a by axial air gap<br>
33b. Air gaps 33a and 33b extend in a direction that is generally parallel to<br>
rotational axis 18.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, magnetic pole pieces 26a-26f carry magnetic flux from<br>
permanent<br>
-6-<br>
magnets 28a-28f and from excitation windings 30 and 32. The flux from excitation windings<br>
30 and 32 is carried to the magnetic pole pieces 26a-26f by end caps 22 and 2.4 and through<br>
air gaps 34. Air gap 34 extends in a direction that is generally perpendicular to rotational axis<br>
18. These characteristics will be described below in detail.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, permanent magnets 28a-f are arranged such that the axis of<br>
magnetization lies in the plane of FIG. 2 (i.e. in the plane of rotation of rotor section 14).<br>
Permanent magnets 28a-f are installed in alternating orientations such that magnetic flux<br>
flows: (i) from a first permanent magnet, (ii) then into an adjacent pole piece (e.g. pole piece<br>
26a-26f), (iii) across air gap 15, (iv) through the back iron portion of stator section 13, (v)<br>
back across air gap 15, and (vi) into the pole piece that is on the other side of the first<br>
permanent magnet wherein it returns to the aforementioned first permanent magnet. This is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2 wherein the flux is represented by arrows 40. Specifically, the flux flows<br>
from magnet 28b into pole piece 26c and then upwards across the air gap 15. The flux then<br>
flows through the back iron portion of stator section 13 and then back across air gap 15 and<br>
into adjacent pole piece 26b where it then returns to permanent magnet 28b. Adjacent<br>
permanent magnet 28c also produces a magnetic flux. This flux is represented by arrows 50<br>
and flows in the same plane as flux 40 but circulates in the opposite direction. This is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2. The flux flows from magnet 28c into pole piece 26c and then upwards<br>
across the air gap 15. The flux then flows through the back iron portion of stator section 13<br>
and then back across air gap 15 and into adjacent pole piece 26d where it then returns to<br>
permanent magnet 28c. As a result of such a configuration, the orientation or direction of the<br>
flux paths (e.g. flux paths 40 and 50) alternate along the circumference of rotor section 14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, excitation windings 30, 32 produce a second magnetic circuit for<br>
rotor section 14. Windings 30 and 32 produce a flux, represented by arrows 60 and 70,<br>
respectively, which flow in the plane of FIG. 1. In other words, the flux represented by<br>
arrows 60 and 70 flow in a plane that is perpendicular to the plane of FIG. 2 (e.g. the flux<br>
indicated by arrows 60 and 70 flows in a plane that is perpendicular to the plane of rotation of<br>
rotor section 14). The direction of the flux is controlled by the direction of the current<br>
crossing the windings 30 and 32. However, the magnetic flux represented by arrows 60 and<br>
70 still crosses air gap 15 and either adds to or subtracts from the magnetic flux produced by<br>
the permanent magnets as necessary to supplement or diminish, respectively, the magnetic<br>
flux depending upon the speed of the alternator and the output voltage requirement.<br>
Due to the characteristics of permanent magnets 28a-28f, the flux from the excitation<br>
windings 30 and 32 has a negligible component passing through permanent magnets 28a-28f.<br>
Furthermore, pole pieces 26a-26f receive flux from both permanent magnets 28a-28f and<br>
from the surrounding excitation windings 30 and 32.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown a perspective view of one quadrant of an alternate<br>
brushless alternator of the present invention. Alternate alternator 100 generally comprises<br>
housing 102, stator section 103 and rotor section 104 which function in the same manner as<br>
housing 12, stator section 13 and rotor section 14, respectively, previously discussed in the<br>
foregoing description. Housing 102 includes lip 105 that circumferentially extends around a<br>
shaft (not shown) about which rotor section 104 rotates. Alternator 100 further includes<br>
excitation winding 106 that functions in the same manner as excitation windings 30 and 32<br>
discussed in the foregoing description. Rotor section 104 has center section 107 which is<br>
comprised of permanent magnets 108 and pole pieces 110 arranged in an alternating<br>
orientation in the same manner as magnets 28a-28f and pole pieces 26a-26f discussed in the<br>
foregoing description. Magnet 108a is shown in phantom. Magnets 108 and pole pieces 110<br>
are generally the same hi construction as magnets 28a-28f and pole pieces 26a-26f,<br>
respectively, previously discussed in the foregoing description. An air gap (not shown)<br>
similar to air gap 15 (see FIG. 1) exists between stator section 103 and rotor section 104.<br>
-8,-<br>
Rotor section 104 further includes a pair of identically constructed extending sections, one of<br>
which being indicated by numeral 112, the other extending section not shown. Magnets 108<br>
and pole pieces 110 are positioned between extending section 112 and the other extending<br>
section that is not shown. Although the ensuing description pertains to extending section 112,<br>
it is to be understood that such description applies to the extending section that is not shown.<br>
In one embodiment, extending section 112 circumferentially extends about the circumference<br>
of rotor section 104. In one embodiment, extending section 112 is configured as an annular<br>
or disk-shaped member comprising a body portion that circumferentially extends about lip<br>
105. Extending section 112 is fabricated from magnetically permeable material. Extending<br>
section 112, as well as the extending section not shown, are attached to pole pieces 110. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, poles pieces 110 and extending section 112 (as well as the extending<br>
section not shown) are integrally formed as one piece. The flux produced from winding 106<br>
is indicated by arrows 120 and lies in a plane that is perpendicular to the plane of rotation of<br>
rotor section 104. The flux from permanent magnet 108a is indicated by arrows 130 and lies<br>
in the same plane as the plane of rotation of the rotor section 104. Thus, the magnetic circuits<br>
are perpendicular to one another and share the pole piece, but flux from the permanent<br>
magnet does not pass through the winding or visa versa.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a perspective view of one quadrant of another<br>
brushless alternator of the present invention which uses claw poles. A typical claw pole<br>
structure is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,892,313, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Alternator 200 generally comprises housing 202, stator section 203 and<br>
rotor section 204 which function in the same manner as housing 12, stator section 13 and<br>
rotor section 14, respectively, previously discussed in the foregoing description. Housing 202<br>
includes lip 205 that circumferentially extends about rotational axis of rotor section 204. Lip<br>
205 extends toward rotor section 204. Alternator 200 further includes excitation winding 206<br>
that functions in the same manner as excitation windings 30 and 32 discussed in the foregoing<br>
description. Winding 206 generally comprises a coil wound about lip 205. Rotor section 204<br>
has center section 207 which is comprised of permanent magnets 208 and internal pole pieces<br>
209 and 210 arranged in an alternating orientation in the same manner as magnets 28a-28f<br>
and pole pieces 26a-26f discussed in the foregoing description. Magnet 208a is shown in<br>
phantom. Magnets 208 and pole pieces 209 and 210 are generally the same in construction as<br>
magnets 28a-28f and pole pieces 26a-26f, respectively, previously discussed in the foregoing<br>
description. The number of permanent magnets 208 and pole pieces 209 and 210 is the same<br>
but can be different than the number of electromagnetic poles of the machine. An air gap (not<br>
shown) similar to air gap 15 (see FIG. 1) exists between stator section 203 and rotor section<br>
204.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, rotor section 204 further includes a pair of radially extending claw<br>
poles, one of which being indicated by numeral 212, the other claw pole not being shown.<br>
Pole pieces 210 are connected to claw pole 212 and pole pieces 209 are connected to the claw<br>
pole not shown. It is to be understood that FIG. 4 is just a partial view (e.g. a quadrant) of<br>
alternator 200 and that there are two claw pole sections generally configured as shown in the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,892,313. An axial air gap 211 magnetically isolates the<br>
magnets 208 from claw pole 212. Section 212 is fabricated from magnetically permeable<br>
material. The flux produced from the winding 206 is indicated by arrows 220 and lies in a<br>
plane that is perpendicular to the plane of rotation of rotor section 204. The flux from<br>
permanent magnet 208a is indicated by arrows 230 and flows through claw pole 212 and<br>
through the air gap separating stator 203 and rotor section 204. Thus, the magnetic circuits<br>
are perpendicular to one another and share the pole piece, but the flux from the permanent<br>
magnet does not pass through the winding or visa versa.<br>
Thus, the following features of the present invention provide an alternator that has<br>
relatively improved performance and efficiency:<br>
a) the induced magnetic field produced by permanent magnets 28a-f<br>
and the induced magnetic field produced by excitation windings 30,<br>
32 have a common magnetic path only inside stator section 13, i.e.<br>
the magnetic flux produced by excitation windings 30, 32 does not<br>
* pass through permanent magnets 28a-28f, and the magnetic flux<br>
produced by permanent magnets 28a-28f does not form a loop<br>
surrounding excitation windings 30,32;<br>
b) the flux path of the excitation winding magnetic circuit is<br>
perpendicular to the flux path of the permanent magnet circuit<br>
outside stator section 13;<br>
c) the flux produced by the excitation windings passes only through<br>
two air gaps compared to four in the brushless Lundell-type<br>
alternator design;<br>
d) relatively more permanent magnets may be placed upon rotor<br>
section 14 since excitation windings 30, 32 are not located on rotor<br>
section 14 but rather, are mounted on lips 12a and 12b of housing<br>
12;<br>
e) since no connections between excitation windings 30, 32 and rotor<br>
section 14 are required, alternator 10 is brushless thereby<br>
eliminating problems relating to performance, wear and<br>
replacement of brushes; and<br>
f) since the number of magnets 208 can be different than the number<br>
of electromagnetic poles of alternator 200, a higher number of<br>
magnets will provide a higher flux density in the claw poles.<br>
