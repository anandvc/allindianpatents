This invention relates to novel urea grease compositions which excel in noise perfcrrrLanoe, have = long life at high temperatures and, further, also provide the basic performance of grease such as shear stability and heat resistance, as well as appropriate oil separation properties.<br>
The foremost characteristic of urea greases using = urea compound as a thickener lies in their heat resistance and oxidative stability. Since greases which have a lubricating life at high temperatures several to ten or more times longer than the lubricating life of ordinary lithium greases have been developed, urea greases are now widely used today in many applications.<br>
However, virtually all urea greases on   the market have a poor noise performance and there are often situations where they cannot be used in many machines and apparatus where silence is nowadays required. The present situation is that the range of applications has become restricted.<br>
electrical appliances, in order to ensure a comfortable and silent living environment, noise countermeasures are indispensable in equipment such as cleaners, washing machines, refrigerator compressors, air-conditioner compressors and fans, electric fans and fan heaters, dryers, exhaust fans and air purifiers. Low-noise greases which have superior noise performance are actively used in the bearing greases used in the rotating parts of these appliances.<br><br>

are required by these domestic appliances, long life at the higher temperatures has become a very strong requirement, depending on the type of appliance. Greases which use urea compounds having superior noise performance as a thickener and which have long life are extremely effective and the development of better products is anticipated. Naturally, the basic performance of bearing grease such as shear stability (leakage resistance), stability at high temperatures and appropriate oil separation properties will be indispensable.<br>
In the automobile industry, too, the requirement for silence has become stronger year by year. In particular, there has been thorough research into noise and its countermeasufes in high-quality saloon cars. Requirements for noise reduction in individual parts thereof are extrem.ely severe. Here, too, the requirement for high-quality greases with excellent noise performance for use in bearings has become stronger each year. Particularly m the case of bearings used in engine parts, long life at higher temperatures has become a very strong requirement. Greases which use urea compounds having superior noise performance as a thickener and which have long life are extremely effective and the development of better products is anticipated. Naturally, as with the above-mentioned greases for domestic electrical appliances, the basic performance of the bearing greases such as shear stability {leakage resistance), stability at high temperatures and appropriate oil separation properties will be indispensable.<br><br>

(where R"' is a diphenylmethane group, H."" and R"^ are each straight-chain or branched saturated alkyl groups having 8 carbons, R^^ is a tolylene group or a bitolylene group, and R^* and R^^ are each alkyl-substituted aromatic groups or halogen-substituted aromatic groups).<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-77494 (1990) describes a thickener comprising a mixture of the above-mentioned diurea compounds (i} and (i1) where, in the above-mentioned general formulas (i) and (ii) , R'^^ is a bitolylene group, R^^  and R^^  each represent a straight-chain or branched saturated alkyl groups or unsaturated alkyl groups having 18 carbons, R^^ is a diphenylmethane group, and R^'* and R^^ are each straight-chain or branched satLiiatej alkyl grcups na"ing ?- c^^rbcns.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent 5-17080 (1994)   discloses a thickener comprising a mixture of the diurea compo".inds (i) and (ii) where, in the above-mentioned general formulas (i) and (ii), H*^ represents a tolylene group, R^'" and R^^ are each straight-chain or branched saturated alkyl groups or unsaturated alkyl groups having from 16 to 18 carbons, R^^ is a diphenylmethane group, and R^* and R^* are each straight-chain or branched saturated alkyl groups having 8 carbons.<br><br>

Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-804S3 (19S0) (Page S, Table 2) describes a composition for use in tapered roller bearings where from 0.5 to 5% by weight of oxidation-modified polyolefin and/or acid-modified polyolefin is added to and mixed with a urea grease. Table 2   there shows urea thickeners using octylamine having 8 carbons, stearylamine (octadecylamine) having 18 carbons and MDI (diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyana-e) as raw materials, and it is demonstrated that the thickenets exhibited excellent effects such as mechanical stability, wet shear stability and pressure transferability.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent 3-2-±353c 11391} describes a diurea compound where, in the above-described general formula (ij, R^^ is a 3,3 '-dimethyl-4,4'-biphenylene group and H^^ and R^'^ are a mixture of an alkyl group having from 3 to 18 carbons and an oleyl group. However, there have been drawbacks with this technique in that penetration has been poor and it has not been possible to obtain greases having a penetration of around 250 unless large amounts of thickener are employed, and the degree of oil separation under high temperatures hB.s  he.en   large.<br><br><br>

It mentions that for the diurea-type grease it is possible to use diisocyanates and monoamines and that, for the monoamines, aliphatic amines such as stearylamine, and oleylamine and aromatic am.ines such as cyclohexylamine can t^'picslly be used. It discloses ~hat this grease has extremely good noise properties in comparison with greases of the prior art.<br>
Further, examples of investigating production methods in order to improve the noise properties of urea greases can be found. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-4895 (1990) describes a production method for a urea grease in which noise properties have been improved by adding an isocyanate and an amine to a base oil, effecting a reaction at a temperature of from 60 to 120'C, performing a dispersion treatment on the resultant mixture of urea compound and base oil by using a kneading apparatus, and then heating up to between 150 and 130°C at a rate of temperature rise of from 0.5 Co 2°C/min.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent 3-190996 (1991) describes a production method for a grease with excellent noise properties in which a base oil in which an isocyanate has been dissolved or  dispersed and a base oil in which an amine has been dissolved or dispersed are pressurised m a reaction vessel, allowing them to react by impinging and mixing with each other or allowing them to react by increasing the pressure and introducing them to rotating mixing paddles.<br><br>
coiTiprised of a first orccess in which a T'ixturs -f fro~ 2 to 30% by weight of a urea compound where, in the above-mentioned general formula (i) , R^' and R'^ are sarurared alkyl groups having from 8 to 13 carbons ar,d R'^ is a tolylene group, a diphenylmechane grsup or a dimethyl biphenylene group, and from 98 to 701 by weight cf a base oil are heated to between 170 and 230'C to cause tihe urea compound to be completely dissolved in the base oil, and a second process in which, after the first process, cooling is effected at a rate of at least 5°C/min. In none of the above-mentioned Patient Documents 1 to 10 is there any description which specifically suggests the urea grease composition of this invention.<br>
As described in. the above-mentioned patent documents, there are many examples where, for the isocyanate raw material, tolylene diisocyanate (TDI) or 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-biphenylene diisocyanate (TGDI) are used in order fco offer urea greases with excellent noise properties. Also, examples are given for production methods in which two or more different kinds of grease are mixed after a reaction process using a kneading apparatus or a high-pressure kettle so that there is no aggregation of the urea compound, and then hea^iing and dissolving the greases.<br>
As the quantities of urea greases produced become greater and the demand for greases with superior noise properties intensifies in the market-place, cleaner working environments for production of ths greases and betner noise properties in the final commercial product are being sought.<br><br>

as a raw ".aCerial, in ccrplex rr^an'-fac^'-iring procedures cannot compete in the market-place.<br>
And as regards grease manufacture, -^.oo,   because of the increase in the quantities manufactured thereof, in is necessary to be even more careful in handling the TDI raw material [which is classified as a Class 2 Specified Chemical Substance under the Industrial Safety and Health Law), and in order to improve noise properties qualitatively, it is necessary to give consideration to reinforcing apparatus and extending manufacturing process times.<br>
This invention provides a urea grease composition which excels in noise performance, has long life at high temperatures and, further, also provides the basic performance of grease such as shear stability and heat resistance, as well as appropriate oil separation properties.<br>
Having taken careful cognisance of the problems and requirements in the marketplace, and by dint of thorough investigation and analysis, as well as intense research, of the scructural components cf urea thicksr.ing sgents in urea grease compositions, the inventors.have discovered that by limiting themselves to urea grease compositions incorporating certain specified urea thickening agents within the structural components of the urea, the result is an excellent urea grease composition which excels in noise performance, has long life at high temperatures and, further, also provides the basic performance of grease such as shear stability and heat resistance, as well as appropriate oil separation properties. They have thus arrived at this invention.<br><br>

(where R^\ R^^ and R" ^re as described before) .<br>
The compounds corresponding to the above-mentioned OCN-R^^-NCO and OCN-R^^-NCO are both diphenylmethane-d , 4 '-diisocyanate.<br>
In order to introduce R^^ and R'^ in compounds of the aforementioned General Formula (A) , R^^NH^ and R'^'^^NHs are used, and in order to introduce R^'^ and R^^ in compounds of the aforementioned General Forrr.ula (B) , R^'NH; and R^NHa are used.<br>
The invention is explained in detail below in relation to compounds of General Formulas (A) and (g) and general formulas (a) to (e) .<br>
The dodecyl group and in particular n-dodecyl group in either of the aforementioned R^" and R^' imparts heat resistance to the urea grease and, by its presence, can extend the life of the urea grease at high temperatures. However, if both R'^ and R^^ are dodecyl groups, the noise performance is poor even though the heat resistance is good. Therefore, if either one of R^^ and R^^ is mad^ a dodecyl group, the other may be a hydrocarbon group of from 6  to 20 carbons, and preferably an oleyl group or an octyl group. Specific examples of raw materials which<br><br>
supply d3de~/I groups preferably include straigr.t-chain<br>
a mixture of a dodecylar'ine and clsyla-iine or oo-yla.-?.ina with diphenyimethane-4,4'-diisocyanate has sxcellsnt thermal stability and grease corrposicions using this are not apt to change at high temperatures, so that the effect on extending life is extremely large. The dodecyl group may occupy from 2 to 70% by mol, and preferably from 4 to 50% by mol, in respect of che tc^ral molar numijer of P/" and R'^ in the aforementioned General Formula (A).<br>
At least one of the aforementioned R'^ and R'^ is an oleyl group and in particular an n-oleyl group. The presence of the oleyl group not only imparts excellent noise performance to the urea grease composition, but the adsorption properties of the urea grease composition in respect of the metal surfaces which form the sliding portions of machine parts become better, and so the lubricating properties are further improved. The oleyl group may occupy from 5 to 70% by mol, and preferably from 8 to 55% by mol, in R^'" and R^^ in the aforementioned General Form.ula (B) .<br>
In this invention it is indispensable 'hat at least an oleyl group and a dodecyl group, particularly an n-dodecyl group, are incorporated in the diurea grease con^Josition, but preferably an octyl group, particularly an n-octyl group, is also incorporated.<br>
If an oleyl group and a dodecyl group are added and an octyl group, particularly an n-octyl group, is further incorporated, it is appropriate if the proportion occupied by the dodecyl group in R^^ and R^^ in the aforementioned General Formula (A) is from 3 to 55% by mol, and further the proportion occupied by the olsyl<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
occupied by the cctyi grcups in ?-"", R"^, R^" and ?.-^ is from 10 to 90% by raol.<br>
Thickening agents encompassed by General Forr.ulas (A) and (B) which are characteristic of this invention may be used in the proportion such that they occupy from 20 to 100% by mol of the cotai thickening agent.<br>
The thickening agents coTiprising diurea compounds as shown by the aforementioned General Formulas (A), ;B) and (a) to [e) may preferably be incorporated in the amount of from 2 to 30% by weight relative to the mineral oils or synthetic oils or mixtures thereof which form the lubricating oil. If the diurea compound'which is the thickening agent is less than 2% by weight relative to the mineral oils or synthetic oils or mixtures thereof which form the lubricating oil, the thickening effect becomes too small and the grease may become too soft, with the risk, for example, of leakage. If it exceeds 30% by weight, the grease may become too hard and its flow resistance increase, so that sufficient lubricating effect is not obtained in that the friction torque increases and ability to penetrate decreases. Also, -h^ cost increases.<br>
For the lubricating base oils in iihis invention, those generally used as lubricating oils and base oils for greases may be used. They are not specially limited, but as examples mention may be made of mineral oils and/or synthetic oils and plant oils. Specific examples of synthetic oils are GTL-derived base oils (produced by the Fischer-Tropsch process), polyolefins such as a-olefin oligomers and polybutenes, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.<br><br>
trimsthylolpropane ester and pen-aer-ythritol ester perfluoroalkyl ethers, silicone oils and pol'^TDhenvi ethers, and as typical exarrples of plant oils men-ion -ay be made of castor oil and rapeseed oil.
