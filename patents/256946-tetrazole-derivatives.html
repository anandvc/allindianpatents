FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to certain tetrazole derivatives, and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, which exhibit useful pharmacological properties, for example as agonists<br>
for the nicotinic acid receptor, RUP25. Also provided by the present invention are<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, and methods<br>
of using the compounds and compositions of the invention in the treatment of metabolic-related<br>
disorders, including dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance, type<br>
2 diabetes, Syndrome-X and the like. In addition, the present invention also provides for the use<br>
of the compounds of the invention in combination with other active agents such as those<br>
belonging to the class of α-glucosidase inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, biguanides, HMG-<br>
CoA reductase inhibitors, squalene synthesis inhibitors, fibrates, LDL catabolism enhancers,<br>
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, insulin secretion enhancers, thiazolidinedione<br>
and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of the invention as Antilipolytic Agents<br>
Atherosclerosis and stroke are the numbers one and number three leading causes of<br>
death of both men and women in the United States. Type 2 diabetes is a public health problem<br>
that is serious, widespread and increasing. Elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)<br>
cholesterol or low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are, independently, risk<br>
factors for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular pathologies. In addition, high levels of<br>
plasma free fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. One strategy<br>
for decreasing LDL-cholesterol, increasing HDL-cholesterol, and decreasing plasma free fatty<br>
acids is to inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue. This approach involves regulation of hormone<br>
sensitive lipase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Lipolytic agents increase cellular<br>
levels of cAMP, which leads to activation of hormone sensitive lipase within adipocytes. Agents<br>
that lower intracellular cAMP levels, by contrast, would be antilipolytic.<br>
It is also worth noting in passing that an increase in cellular levels of cAMP down-<br>
regulates the secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes [Delporte, ML et al. Biochem ./(2002)<br>
July], Reduced levels of plasma adiponectin have been associated with metabolic-related<br>
disorders, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes<br>
[Matsuda, M et al. J Biol Chem (2002) July and reviewed therein]<br><br><br>
Nicotinic acid (niacin, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin required by<br>
the human body for health, growth and reproduction; a part of the Vitamin B complex. Nicotinic<br>
acid is also one of the oldest used drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is a valuable drug in<br>
that it favorably affects virtually all ofthe lipid parameters listed above [Goodman and Gilman's<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, editors Harmon JG and Limbird IE, Chapter 36, Mahley<br>
RW and Bersot TP (2001) pages 971-1002]. The benefits of nicotinic acid in the treatment or<br>
prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been documented in six major clinical<br>
trials [Guyton JR (1998) Am J Cardiol 82:18U-23U], Nicotinic acid and related derivatives,<br>
such as, acipimox have recently been discussed [Lorenzen, A et al (2001) Molecular<br>
Pharmacology 59:349-357], Structure and synthesis of additional analogs or derivatives of<br>
nicotinic acid are discussed throughout the Merck Index, An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs,<br>
and Biologicals, Tenth Edition (1983), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Nicotinic acid inhibits the production and release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue,<br>
likely via an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels, and a<br>
concomitant decrease in hormone sensitive lipase activity. Agonists that down-regulate honnone<br>
sensitive lipase activity leading to a decrease in plasma free fatty acid levels are likely to have<br>
therapeutic value. The consequence of decreasing plasma free fatty acids is two-fold. First, it<br>
will ultimately lower LDL-cholesterol and raise HDL-cholesterol levels, independent risk<br>
factors, thereby reducing the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular incidence subsequent to<br>
atheroma formation. Second, it will provide an increase in insulin sensitivity in individuals with<br>
insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the use of nicotinic acid as a therapeutic is<br>
partially limited by a number of associated, adverse side-effects. These include flushing, free<br>
fatty acid rebound, and liver toxicity.<br>
The rational development of novel, nicotinic acid receptor agonists that have fewer side-<br>
effects will be valuable, but to date this has been hindered by the inability to molecularly identify<br>
the nicotinic acid receptor. Furthermore, other receptors of the same class may exist on the<br>
surface of adipocytes and similarly decrease hormone sensitive lipase activity through a<br>
reduction in the level of intracellular cAMP but without the elicitation of adverse effects such as<br>
flushing, thereby representing promising novel therapeutic targets. Recent work suggests that<br>
nicotinic acid probably acts through a specific GPCR [Lorenzen A, et al. (2001) Molecular<br>
Pharmacology 59:349-357 and reviewed therein]. Further work has suggested that the effects of<br>
nicotinic acid on macrophages, spleen and probably adipocytes are mediated via this specific<br>
GPCR [Lorenzen A, et al. (2002) Biochemical Pharmacology 64:645-648 and reviewed therein].<br>

suitable solvent like THF in the presence of NaOH as the base to give the N-benzyl pyrazole<br>
(AB). The pyrazole (AB) can be saponified using methods known to one of skill in the art,<br>
for example, treating with aqueous sodium hydroxide in a solvent mixture such as<br>
THF/MeOH. The acid (AC) is coupled with yV-hydroxy succinimide using a coupling reagent<br>
such as EDC. The ester (AD) is converted to the amide (AE) by treatment with concentrated<br>
NH4OH solution in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane. The amide (AE) can be reacted with a<br>
dehydrating reagent such as cyanuric chloride, trifluro acetic anhydride, thionyl chloride and<br>
like, in the presence of a non protic solvent such as DMF to give the nitrile (AF). The nitrile<br>
(AF) is treated with an excess of borane-THF solution in a solvent like THF at low<br><br>
temperature, followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sodium<br>
hydroxide to give a 1:1 mixture of alcohols shown as (AC) and (AG").<br>
Utilizing either alcohol (AC) or alcohol (AG") a variety of ethers can be prepared.<br>
A representative synthesis is shown in Reaction Scheme IV using alcohol (AC)- It is<br>
understood that a similar synthetic scheme can be utilized starting with alcohol (AG").<br><br>
Compounds of the structure (AH) can be prepared by treating the alcohol<br>
intermediate (AC) with an excess of alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as sodium<br>
hydride in an aprotic solvent such as DMF. The nitrile (AH) is reacted with an azide such as<br>
sodium azide, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as zinc bromide, to give the tetrazole of<br>
the structure (Al). Final compounds can be prepared by removal of the benzyl protecting<br>
group under oxidative conditions in a solvent like DMSO using a base such as potassium t-<br>
butoxide and oxygen gas.<br>
One method that can be used to prepare certain compounds of Formula (I) utilizes<br>
intermediate (AS) as illustrated in Reaction Scheme V below:<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of the structure (AV) can be prepared from 3-ethoxy-cyclopentenone by<br>
treatment with dialkyloxalate such as di-tert-butyl oxalate or diethyloxalate in the presence of<br>
a non-nucleophilic base such as LDA or LHMDS in a solvent such as THF to give the keto-<br>
ester (AM). The keto ester (AIM) is reacted with benzyl hydrazine under reflux in a polar<br>
solvent, such as ethanol or methanol containing glacial acetic acid to give the pyrazole (AN).<br>
Alternatively, the keto-ester (AM) can be reacted with hydrazine, followed by alkylation of<br>
the pyrazole with benzyl bromide using cesium carbonate as the base in a non-protic solvent<br>
such as DMF. The pyrazole ester (AN) can be converted to the nitrile (AR) using a similar<br>
sequence of steps described for (AC). The ketone (AR) is converted to the vinyl triflate<br>
(AS) using Commins' reagent in the presence of LDA in a solvent such as THF.<br>
Utilizing compound (AS), a variety of substituents (wherein R'is (^.4 alkyl, C2.4<br>
alkenyl, and C2.4 alkynyl) can be introduced at C-5 as shown in Reaction Scheme VI.<br><br><br><br>
The triflate (AS) can be reacted with a suitable stannane reagent in the presence of a<br>
base such as lithium chloride and a catalyst such as tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0)<br>
in a suitable solvent such as THF or toluene. Alternatively, the triflate (AS) can be reacted<br>
with a suitable alkenyl boronic acid in the presence of a base such as potassium phosphate and<br>
a catalyst such as tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0) in a suitable solvent such as 1,4-<br>
dioxane. The nitrile (AT) is reacted with an azide such as sodium azide, in the presence of a<br>
Lewis acid such as zinc bromide, to give the tetrazole of the structure (AU). Final compounds<br>
are prepared by the removal of the benzyl protecting group that can be performed under<br>
reductive conditions using palladium black in a polar solvent such as methanol or ethanol and<br>
acid such as formic acid or concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
Alternatively, alcohol (AC) may be fluorinated using methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art, such as DAST [(diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride], to provide a fluoro<br>
compound which can be elaborated to its tetrazole derivative and deprotected using methods<br>
described herein.<br>
One method that can be used to prepare certain compounds of Formula (I) is illustrated<br>
in Reaction Scheme VII below:<br><br><br><br>
A compound of the structure (BF) can be prepared from the keto ester (AM) by<br>
reacting with hydrazine hydrate in a polar solvent such as ethanol containing glacial acetic<br>
acid to give the pyrazole (AW). The pyrazole (AW) can be reacted with a sufonyl chloride<br>
such as p-toluene sulfonyl chloride in a solvent such as CH2CI2 in the presence of a base such<br>
as pyridine to give the TV-sulfonylated derivative (AX). The pyrazole ester (AX) can be<br>
deprotected under acidic conditions using an acid such as TFA in CH2CI2 to form (AY). The<br>
pyrazole acid (AY) can be converted to the nitrile (BB) using a similar sequence of steps<br>
described for (AC). The ketone (BB) can be converted to the vinyl triflate (BC) using<br>
Commins' reagent in the presence of a base such as LDA in a solvent such as THF.<br>
The triflate (BC) can be coupled with tetramethyltin in the presence of a base such as<br>
lithium chloride and a catalyst such as tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0) in a suitable<br>
solvent such as THF or toluene. The p-toluene sulfonyl group can be removed by reacting<br>
with tetra butyl ammonium fluoride solution in a solvent such as THF to give the pyrazole<br>
(BE). The final compound is prepared by reacting the nitrile (BE) with an azide such as<br>
sodium azide, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as zinc bromide, to give the tetrazole (BF).<br>

Compounds of Formula (I) may have one or more chiral centers, and therefore exist as<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. The invention is understood to extend to all such enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers and mixtures thereof, including racemates. Formula (I) and the formulae<br>
described herein, supra, are intended to represent all individual isomers and mixtures thereof,<br>
unless stated or shown otherwise.<br>
Racemic mixtures can be resolved into the optical pure enatiomers by known methods,<br>
for example, by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof with an optically active acid, and<br>
liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Another method for<br>
resolving racemates into the optical pure enatiomers is based upon chromatography on an<br>
optically active matrix or chiral support. Certain racemic compounds of the present invention<br>
can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of d- or 1-<br>
(tartrates, mandelates, or camphorsulphonate) salts for example. The compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric amides or ester by reaction of<br>
the compounds of the present invention with an optically active activated carboxylic acid such as<br>
that derived from (+) or (-) phenylalanine, (+) or (-) phenylglycine, (+) or (-) camphanic acid or<br>
by the formation of diastereomeric carbamates by reaction of the compounds of the present<br>
invention with an optically active chloroformate or the like subsequently hydrolyzed.<br>
Additional methods for the resolution of optical isomers known to those skilled in the art<br>
can be used and will be apparent to the average worker skilled in the art. Such methods include<br>
those discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet, and S. Wilen in "Enantiomers, Racemates, and<br>
Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981).<br>
It is understood that the chemistry described herein is representative and is not intended<br>
to be limiting in any manner.<br>

Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of producing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing or combining a compound of Formula (I), as<br>
described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Compositions of the Present Invention<br>
Some embodiments of the present invention include pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a compound according to Formula (I) in combination with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the<br>
compound embodiments disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Formulations can be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the<br>
active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required<br>
proportions, and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.<br>
Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents,<br>
tabletting lubricants, and disintegrants can be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration can be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or<br>
oily suspensions, and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations can be in the form of dry<br>
powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use.<br>
Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including<br>
edible oils), preservatives, and flavorings and colorants can be added to the liquid preparations.<br>
Parenteral dosage forms can be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a<br><br><br>
suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate<br>
vial or ampoule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in<br>
the art for preparing dosage forms.<br>
A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see<br>
Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20'h Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams &amp;<br>
Wilkins, (Editors; Gennaro, A. R., et al.).<br>
While it is possible that a compound for use in the treatment of the present invention<br>
may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however to<br>
present the compound or "active ingredient" as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition<br>
further comprising a pharmaceutical ly acceptable carrier. Therefore, one aspect of the present<br>
invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical ly acceptable<br>
carrier in combination with at least one compound according to Formula (1).<br>
The invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the<br>
invention or a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof together with one or<br>
more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the<br>
sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious<br>
to the recipient thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical<br>
(including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous<br>
and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation<br>
or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting<br>
the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug.<br>
Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure<br>
sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired<br>
efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.<br>
The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or<br>
diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages<br>
thereof, and in such form can be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids<br>
such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for<br>
oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable<br>
solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions,<br>
with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may<br><br><br>
contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended<br>
daily dosage range to be employed.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of, for<br>
example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably<br>
made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient.<br>
Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or a suspension, with<br>
conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders such<br>
as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators<br>
such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as<br>
talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a<br>
composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water can be used as a suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Compounds of the present invention or a solvate or physiologically functional derivative<br>
thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as RUP25<br>
receptor agonists. By the term "active ingredient" is defined in the context of a "pharmaceutical<br>
composition" and shall mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the<br>
primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an "'inactive ingredient" which would generally be<br>
recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit.<br>
The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide<br>
limits, and as is customary and is known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual<br>
conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the<br>
illness to be treated, on the condition of the patient, on the compound employed or on whether an<br>
acute or chronic disease state is treated is conducted or on whether further active compounds are<br>
administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the<br>
present invention include, but not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 to<br>
about 2500 mg, about 0.001 to about 1000 mg, 0.001 to about 500 mg, 0.001 mg to about 250<br>
mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg, and about 0.001 mg to about 25<br>
mg. Multiple doses can be administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts<br>
are deemed to be needed, for example 2, 3 or 4, doses. Depending on the individual and as<br>
deemed appropriate from the patient's physician or care-giver it may be necessary to deviate<br>
upward or downward from the doses described herein.<br>
The amount of active ingredient, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use<br>
in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of<br>
administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient<br>
and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one<br>
skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system to<br>
another, for example, an animal model to a human. Typically, animal models include, but are not<br><br><br>
limited to, the rodents diabetes models as described in Example I, infra; the mouse<br>
atherosclerosis model as described in Example 2, infra; or the in vivo animal athosclerosis model<br>
as described in Example 5, infra. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be<br>
based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably<br>
a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weight differences,<br>
but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight,<br>
sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of<br>
administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic<br>
and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is<br>
utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated is conducted or on whether<br>
further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the Formula (I) and<br>
as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the<br>
compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors,<br>
such as, those cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and<br>
therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where<br>
appropriate, can be used in the methods of this invention.<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses<br>
administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.<br>
The sub-dose itself can be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced<br>
administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are<br>
administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. If<br>
appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it can be necessary to deviate upward or<br>
downward from the daily dose indicated.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral<br>
and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following<br>
dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present<br>
invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form<br>
preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible<br>
granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents,<br>
flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet<br>
disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely<br>
divided active component.<br><br><br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding<br>
capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size<br>
The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active<br>
compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90<br>
percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this<br>
range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate,<br>
magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.<br>
The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with<br>
encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or<br>
without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly,<br>
cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can<br>
be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid<br>
glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously<br>
therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized<br>
molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons,<br>
creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers<br>
as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example,<br>
water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations<br>
can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations,<br>
for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to<br>
the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic<br>
parcnterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among<br>
the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and<br>
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as<br>
a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral<br>
administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and can be<br>
presented in unit dose form in'ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-<br>
dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as<br>
suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory<br><br><br>
agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active<br>
ingredient can be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by<br>
lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free<br>
water, before use.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active<br>
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilizing and thickening agents, as<br>
desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided<br>
active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly<br>
before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include<br>
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active<br>
component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants,<br>
thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention<br>
can be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.<br>
Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base<br>
with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions can be formulated with an<br>
aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing<br>
agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges<br>
comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles<br>
comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and<br>
acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means,<br>
for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations can be provided in single or<br>
multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this can be achieved by the patient<br>
administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of<br>
a spray, this can be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol<br>
formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable<br>
propellant. If the compounds of the Formula (I) or pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be<br>
carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a<br>
metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the<br>
compounds of the Formula (1) as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well-known to the<br><br><br>
person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the<br>
compounds of the Formula (1) in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be<br>
employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others, and,<br>
if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFC's, such as,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The<br>
aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug can be<br>
controlled by provision of a metered valve.<br>
In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal<br>
formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of<br>
10 microns or less. Such a particle size can be obtained by means known in the art, for example<br>
by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active<br>
ingredient can be employed.<br>
Alternatively the active ingredients can be provided in the form of a dry powder, for<br>
example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch<br>
derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).<br>
Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition can<br>
be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister<br>
packs from which the powder can be administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the<br>
preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active<br>
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing<br>
discrete quantities ofpreparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or<br>
ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can<br>
be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration are<br>
preferred compositions.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be converted to 'pro-drugs." The term "pro-<br>
drugs" refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the<br>
art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the<br>
parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one<br>
or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate<br>
a property of the compound. In general, the "pro-drug" approach is utilized to facilitate oral<br>
absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Novel<br>
Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in<br>
Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press,<br>
1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br><br><br>

drugs cited herein.<br>
It is understood that the scope of combination-therapy of the compounds of the present<br>
invention with other pharmaceutical agents is not limited to those listed herein, supra or infra,<br>
but includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical agent or pharmaceutical<br>
composition useful for the treatment of diseases, conditions or disorders that are linked to<br>
metabolic-related disorders.<br>

One aspect of the present invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising at least one compound according to Formula (1), as described herein. In some<br>
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more agents selected<br>
from the group consisting of, for example, a-glucosidase inhibitor, aldose reductase inhibitor,<br>
biguanide, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, squalene synthesis inhibitor, fibrate, LDL catabolism<br>
enhancer, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, insulin secretion enhancer and<br>

Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include a-glucosidase inhibitors. a-Glucosidase inhibitors belong to the class<br>
of drugs which competitively inhibit digestive enzymes such as a-amylase, maltase, a-<br>
dextrinase, sucrase, etc. in the pancreas and or small intestine. The reversible inhibition by a-<br>
glucosidase inhibitors retard, diminish or otherwise reduce blood glucose levels by delaying the<br>
digestion of starch and sugars. Some representative examples of a-glucosidase inhibitors include<br>
acarbose, N-(l ,3-dihydroxy-2-propyl)valiolamine (generic name; voglibose), miglitol, and a-<br>
glucosidase inhibitors known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include sulfonylureas. The sulfonylureas (SU) are drugs which promote<br>
secretion of insulin from pancreatic (3 cells by transmitting signals of insulin secretion via SU<br>
receptors in the cell membranes. Examples of the sulfonylureas include glyburide, glipizide,<br>
glimepiride and other sulfonylureas known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>

represent a novel class of insulin secretagogues. These agents target postprandial hyperglycemia<br>
and show comparable efficacy to sulfonylureas in reducing HbA|C. Examples of meglitinides<br>
include repaglinide, nateglinide and other meglitinides known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include the biguanides. The biguanides represent a class of drugs that stimulate<br>
anaerobic glycolysis, increase the sensitivity to insulin in the peripheral tissues, inhibit glucose<br>
absorption from the intestine, suppress of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and inhibit fatty acid<br>
oxidation. Examples of biguanides include phenformin, metformin, buformin, and biguanides<br>
known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include the a-glucosidase inhibitors. The a-glucosidase inhibitors<br>
competitively inhibit digestive enzymes such as a-amylase, maltase, a-dextrinase, sucrase, etc.<br><br><br>
in the pancreas and or small intestine. The reversible inhibition by a-glucosidase inhibitors<br>
retard, diminish or otherwise reduce blood glucose levels by delaying the digestion of starch and<br>
sugars. Examples of a-glucosidase inhibitors include acarbose, N-(l ,3-dihydroxy-2-<br>
propyl)valiolamine (generic name; voglibose), rniglitol, and a-glucosidase inhibitors known in<br>
the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-y (i.e., PPAR-y)<br>
agonists. The peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-y agonists represent a class of<br>
compounds that activates the nuclear receptor PPAR-y and therefore regulate the transcription of<br>
insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport and utilization.<br>
Agents in the class also facilitate the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Examples of PPAR-y<br>
agonists include rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, tesaglitazar, netoglitazone, GW-409544, GW-<br>
5015 16 and PPAR-y agonists known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The HMG-CoA reductase<br>
inhibitors are agents also referred to as Statin compounds that belong to a class of drugs that<br>
lower blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutalyl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase.<br>
HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The statins lower<br>
serum LDL concentrations by upregulating the activity of LDL receptors and are responsible for<br>
clearing LDL from the blood. Some representative examples the statin compounds include<br>
rosuvastatin, pravastatin and its sodium salt, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin,<br>
cerivastatin, pitavastatin, BMS's "superstatin", and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors known in the<br>

present invention include the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors belong to the class of drugs that partially lower blood glucose<br>
levels as well as lowering blood pressure by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzymes.<br>
Examples of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, alacepril,<br>
delapril; ramipril, lisinopril, imidapril, benazepril, ceronapril, cilazapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril,<br>
moveltopril, perindopril, quinapril, spirapril, temocapril, trandolapril, and angiotensin converting<br>
enzyme inhibitors known in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in conjunction with compounds of the<br>
present invention include the angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II receptor<br>
antagonists target the angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (i.e., ATI) and demonstrate a beneficial<br>
effect on hypertension. Examples of angiotensin II receptor antagonists include losartan (and the<br>
potassium salt form), and angiotensin II receptor antagonists known in the art.<br><br><br>
Other treatments for one or more of the diseases cited herein include the use of one or<br>
more pharmaceutical agents known in the art that belong to the classes of drugs referred to, but<br>
not limited to, the following: amylin agonists (for example, pramlintide), insulin secretogogues<br>
(for example, GLP-1 agonists; exendin-4; insulinotropin (NN2211); dipeptyl peptidase inhibitors<br>
(for example, NVP-DPP-728), acyl CoA cholesterol acetyltransferase inhibitors (for example,<br>
Ezetimibe, eflucimibe, and like compounds), cholesterol absorption inhibitors (for example,<br>
ezetimibe, pamaqueside and like compounds), cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (for<br>
example, CP-529414, JTT-705, CETi-1, torcetrapib and like compounds), microsomal<br>
triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors (for example, implitapide, and like compounds),<br>
cholesterol modulators (for example, NO-1886, and like compounds), bile acid modulators (for<br>
example, G'l'l03-279 and like compounds) and squalene synthase inhibitors.<br>
Squalene synthesis inhibitors belong to a class of drugs that lower blood cholesterol<br>
levels by inhibiting synthesis of squalene. Examples of the squalene synthesis inhibitors include<br>
(S)-ct-[Bis[2,2-dimethyl-1 -oxopropoxy)methoxy] phosphinyl]-3-phenoxybenzenebutanesulfonic<br>
acid, mono potassium salt (BMS-188494) and squalene synthesis inhibitors known in the art.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the combination can be used by mixing the<br>
respective active components either all together or independently with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier, excipient, binder, diluent, etc., as described herein above, and administering<br>
the mixture or mixtures either orally or non-orally as a pharmaceutical composition. When a<br>
compound or a mixture of compounds of Formula (I) are administered as a combination therapy<br>
with another active compound the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate<br>
pharmaceutical compositions given at the same time or at different times, or the therapeutic<br>
agents can be given as a single composition.<br>

Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to radio-labeled compounds of Formula<br>
(1) that are useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for<br>
localizing and quantitating RUP25 in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying<br><br><br>
RUP25 ligands by inhibition binding of a radio-labeled compound. It is a further object of this<br>
invention to include novel RUP25 assays of which comprise such radio-labeled compounds.<br>
The present invention embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula (I) and any<br>
subgenera herein, such as but not limited to, Formulae (la) to (iz); and (lla) to (lid). An<br>
"isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compounds are those which are identical to compounds<br>
disclosed herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom<br>
having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically<br>
found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that can be incorporated in<br>
compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to 2H (also written as D for<br>
deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), "C, nC, l4C, l3N, 15N, l50, l70,180, l8F, ,5S, 36CI,<br>
82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, l23l, 124l, 125I and ml. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant<br>
radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound.<br>
For example, for in vitro RUP25 labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate<br>
3H, !4C, 82Br, l25I, l3'l, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications "C,<br>
"F, l25l, '23l, 124l, "'1,75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.<br>
It is understood that a "radio-labeled " or "labeled compound" is a compound of<br>
Formula (I) that has incorporated at least one radionuclide; in some embodiments the<br>
radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, l4C, l23l , 35S and 82Br.<br>
Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound<br>
and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide 3H and/or l4C<br>
isotopes are useful in these studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium<br>
(i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability<br>
(e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence can be preferred in<br>
some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be<br>
prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes supra and<br>
Examples infra, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled<br>
reagent. Other synthetic methods that are useful are discussed infra. Moreover, it should be<br>
understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the<br>
most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the more scarce radio-isotope or nonradio-<br>
active isotope.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are<br>
applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. These synthetic<br>
methods, for example, incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules, and are as<br>
follows:<br>
A. Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas - This procedure normally yields high specific<br>
activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors.<br><br><br>
B.	Reduction with Sodium Borohydride [ H] - This procedure is rather inexpensive and<br>
requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones,<br>
esters, and the like.<br>
C.	Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [3H ] - This procedure offers products at<br>
almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional<br>
groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters, and the like.<br>
D.	Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling - This procedure involves exposing precursors<br>
containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst.<br>
E.	N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [JH] - This procedure is usually employed to<br>
prepare O-methyl orN-methyl (3H) products by treating appropriate precursors with high<br>
specific activity methyl iodide (3H). This method in general allows for higher specific activity,<br>
such as for example, about 70-90 Ci/mmol.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of l23I into target molecules include:<br>
A.	Sandmeyer and like reactions - This procedure transforms an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
amine into a diazonium salt, such as a tetrafluoroborate salt, and subsequently to 125I labeled<br>
compound using Na12Sl. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, D.-G. and co-workers in<br>
J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 943-948.<br>
B.	Ortho '"lodination of phenols - This procedure allows for the incorporation of l23l at<br>
the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in J. Labeled Compd<br>
Radiopharm. 1999, 42, S264-S266.<br>
C.	Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with '251 - This method is generally a two<br>
step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the<br>
corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction (i.e. Pd(Ph:,P)4]<br>
or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-alky Itinhalide or hexaalkylditin<br>
[e.g., (CH-,)3SnSn(CHi)v|. A represented procedure was reported by Bas, M.-D. and co-workers<br>
in./ Labeled Compd Radiopharm 2001, 44, S280-S282.<br>
A radio-labeled RUP25 compound of Formula (I) can be used in a screening assay to<br>
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e.,<br>
test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the "radio-labeled compound<br>
of Formula (1)" to the RUP25 receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete<br>
with the "radio-labeled compound of Formula (I)" for the binding to the RUP25 receptor directly<br>
correlates to its binding affinity.<br>
The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the RUP25 receptor. In one<br>
embodiment the labeled compound has an IC50 less than about 500 u,M, in another embodiment<br>
the labeled compound has an ICJO less than about 100 u.M, in yet another embodiment the labeled<br>
compound has an IC50 less than about 10 u,M, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound<br><br><br>
has an IC50 less than about 1 u.M, and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an<br>
IC50 less than about 0.1 U.M.<br>
Other uses of the disclosed receptors and methods will become apparent to those in the art based<br>
upon, inter alia, a review of this disclosure.<br>
As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention need not be<br>
performed any particular number of times or in any particular sequence. Additional objects,<br>
advantages, and novel features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
upon examination of the following examples thereof, which are intended to be illustrative and not<br>
intended to be limiting.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples are provided for illustrative purposes and not as a means of<br>
limitation. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to design equivalent assays and methods<br>
based on the disclosure herein, all of which form part of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
RODENT DIABETES MODELS<br>
Rodent models of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance have<br>
been developed. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob [see Diabetes (1982)31:1-6] in mice<br>
and fa/fa in zucker rats have been developed for understanding the pathophysiology of disease<br>
and for testing candidate therapeutic compounds [Diabetes (1983) 32:830-838; Annu Rep<br>
Sankyo Res Lab (1994) 46:1-57]. The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed<br>
by Jackson Laboratory are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsuhnemic and insulin resistant [J Clin<br>
Invest (1990) 85:962-967], whereas heterozygotes are lean and normoglycemic. In the db/db<br>
model, mice progressively develop insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late<br>
stages of human type 2 diabetes when sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. Since this model<br>
resembles that of human type 2 diabetes, the compounds of the present invention are tested for<br>
activities including, but not limited to, lowering of plasma glucose and triglycerides. Zucker<br>
(fa/fa) rats are severely obese, hyperinsuhnemic, and insulin resistant {Coleman, Diabetes (1982)<br>
31:1; E Shafrir in Diabetes Mellitus, H Rifkinand D Porte, Jr, Eds [Elsevier Science Publishing<br>
Co, New York, ed. 4, (1990), pp. 299-340]}, and the fa/fa mutation may be the rat equivalent of<br>
the murine db mutation [Friedman et al, Cell (1992) 69:217-220; Truett et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci<br>
USA (1991) 88:7806]. Tubby (tub/tub) mice are characterized by obesity, moderate insulin<br>
resistance and hyperinsulineinia without significant hyperglycemia [Coleman et al, Heredity<br>
(1990)81:424].<br><br><br>
The present invention encompasses the use of compounds of the invention for reducing<br>
the insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in any or all of the above rodent diabetes models, in<br>
humans with type 2 diabetes or other preferred metabolic-related disorders or disorders of lipid<br>
metabolism described previously, or in models based on other mammals. Plasma glucose and<br>
insulin levels will be tested, as well as other factors including, but not limited to, plasma free<br>
fatty acids and triglycerides.<br>
In Vivo Assay for Anti-Hvperglvcemic Activity of Compounds of the Invention<br>
Genetically altered obese diabetic mice (db/db) (male, 7-9 weeks old) are housed (7-9<br>
mice/cage) under standard laboratory conditions at 22°C and 50% relative humidity, and<br>
maintained on a diet of Purina rodent chow and water ad libitum. Prior to treatment, blood is<br>
collected from the tail vein of each animal and blood glucose concentrations are determined<br>
using One Touch Basic Glucose Monitor System (Lifescan). Mice that have plasma glucose<br>
levels between 250 to 500 mg/dl are used. Each treatment group consists of seven mice that are<br>
distributed so that the mean glucose levels are equivalent in each group at the start of the study,<br>
db/db mice are dosed by micro-osmotic pumps, inserted using isoflurane anesthesia, to provide<br>
compounds of the invention, saline, or an irrelevant compound to the mice subcutaneous ly (s.c).<br>
Blood is sampled from the tail vein at intervals thereafter and analyzed for blood glucose<br>
concentrations. Significant differences between groups (comparing compounds of the invention<br>

MOUSE ATHEROSCLEROSIS MODEL<br>
Adiponectin-deficient mice generated through knocking out the adiponectin gene have<br>
been shown to be predisposed to atherosclerosis and to be insulin resistant. The mice are also a<br>
suitable model for ischemic heart disease [Matsuda, M et al. J Biol Chem (2002) July, and<br>
references cited therein, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety].<br>
Adiponectin knockout mice are housed (7-9 mice/cage) under standard laboratory<br>
conditions at 22°C and 50% relative humidity. The mice are dosed by micro-osmotic pumps,<br>
inserted using isoflurane anesthesia, to provide compounds of the invention, saline, or an<br>
irrelevant compound to the mice subcutaneously (s.c). Neointimal thickening and ischemic<br>
heart disease are determined for different groups of mice sacrificed at different time intervals.<br>
Significant differences between groups (comparing compounds of the invention to saline-treated)<br>
are evaluated using Student t-test.<br>

In Vitro Biological Activity<br><br><br>
A modified Flash Plate™ Adinylyl Cyclase kit (New England Nuclear; Cat. No.<br>
SMP004A) was utilized for direct identification of candidate compounds as agonists to<br>
hRUP25 in accordance with the following protocol. The term hRUP25 includes the human<br>
sequences found in GenBank Accession No. NM177551 for the nucleotide and GenBank<br>
Accession No. NP 808219 for the polypeptide, and naturally-occurring allelic variants,<br>
mammalian orthologs, and recombinant mutants thereof.<br>
CHO cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding hRUP25 and cultured<br>
under condition permissive for cell surface expression of the encoded hRUP25 receptor were<br>
harvested from flasks via non-enzymatic means. The cells were washed in PBS and<br>
resuspended in the manufacturer's Assay Buffer. Live cells were counted using a<br>
hemacytometer and Trypan blue exclusion, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 2xl06<br>
cells/ml. cAMP standards and Detection Buffer (comprising 2 u,Ci of tracer [125l]-cAMP (100<br>
ul) to 11 ml Detection Buffer) were prepared and maintained in accordance with the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Candidate compounds identified as per above (if frozen, thawed<br>
at room temperature) were added to their respective wells (preferably wells of a 96-well plate)<br>
at increasing concentrations (3ul/well; 12uM final assay concentration). To these wells,<br>
100,000 cells in 50u.l of Assay Buffer were added and the mixture was then incubated for 30<br>
minutes at room temperature, with gentle shaking. Following the incubation, lOOul of<br>
Detection Buffer was added to each well, followed by incubation for 2-24 hours. Plates were<br>
counted in a Wallac MicroBeta™ plate reader using "Prot. #31" (as per manufacturer<br>
instructions).<br>

In Vivo Animal Model<br>
One utility of the compound of the present invention as a medical agent in the<br>
prophylaxis and treatment of a high total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and conditions<br>
relating thereto is demonstrated by the activity of the compound in lowering the ratio of total<br>
cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol, in elevating HDL-cholesterol, or in protection from<br>
atherosclerosis in an in vivo pig model. Pigs are used as an animal model because they reflect<br>
human physiology, especially lipid metabolism, more closely than most other animal models.<br>
An illustrative in vivo pig model not intended to be limiting is presented here<br>
Yorkshire albino pigs (body weight 25.5 ± 4 kg) are fed a saturated fatty acid rich and<br>
cholesterol rich (SFA-CHO) diet during 50 days (1 kg chow 35 kg"' pig weight), composed of<br>
standard chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol and 20% beef tallow [Royo T et al., European<br>
Journal of Clinical Investigation (2000) 30:843-52; which disclosure is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety]. Saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio is modified from 0.6 in normal<br>
pig chow to 1. 12 in the SFA-CHO diet. Animals are divided into two groups, one group {n = 8)<br>
fed with the SFA-CHO diet and treated with placebo and one group (w = 8) fed with the SFA-<br>
CHO diet and treated with the compound (3.0 mg kg"1). Control animals are fed a standard chow<br>
for a period of 50 days. Blood samples are collected at baseline (2 days after the reception of the<br>
animals), and 50 days after the initiation of the diet. Blood lipids are analyzed. The animals are<br>
sacrificed and necropsied.<br>
Alternatively, the foregoing analysis comprises a plurality of groups each treated with a<br>
different dose of the compound. Preferred said doses are selected from the group consisting of:<br>
0.1 mgkg"',0.3mgkg"', 1.0 mg kg"', 3.0 mg kg"', 10 mg kg', 30 mgkg"1 and lOOmgkg"1.<br>
Alternatively, the foregoing analysis is carried out at a plurality of timepoints. Preferred said<br>
timcpoints are selected from the group consisting of 10 weeks, 20 weeks, 30 weeks, 40 weeks,<br>
and 50 weeks.<br>
HDL-Cholesterol<br>
Blood is collected in trisodium citrate (3.8%, 1:10). Plasma is obtained after<br>
centrifugation (1200 g 15 min) and immediately processed. Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,<br>
and LDL-cholesterol are measured using the automatic analyzer Kodak Ektachem DT System<br>
(Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). Samples with value parameters above the<br>
range are diluted with the solution supplied by the manufacturer and then re-analyzed. The total<br>
cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio is determined. Comparison is made of the level of HDL-<br>
cholesterol between groups. Comparison is made of the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio<br>
between groups.<br><br><br>
Elevation of HDL-cholesterol or reduction of the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio<br>
on administration of the compound is taken as indicative of the compound having the aforesaid<br>
utility.<br>
Atherosclerosis<br>
The thoracic and abdominal aortas are removed intact, opened longitudinally along the<br>
ventral surface, and fixed in neutral-buffered formalin after excision of samples from standard<br>
sites in the thoracic and abdominal aorta for histological examination and lipid composition and<br>
synthesis studies. After fixation, the whole aortas are stained with Sudan IV and pinned out flat,<br>
and digital images are obtained with a TV camera connected to a computerized image analysis<br>
system (Image Pro Plus; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) to determine the percentage of<br>
aortic surface involved with atherosclerotic lesions [Gerrity RG et al, Diabetes (2001) 50:1654-<br>
65, Comhill IF et a\. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (1985) 5:415-26;<br>
which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety]. Comparison is made<br>
between groups of the percentage of aortic surface involved with atherosclerotic lesions.<br>
Reduction of the percentage of aortic surface involved with atherosclerotic lesions on<br>
administration of the compound is taken as indicative of the compound having the aforesaid<br>
utility<br>
Example 6<br>
Receptor Binding Assay<br>
In addition to the methods described herein, another means for evaluating a test<br>
compound is by determining binding affinities to the RUP25 receptor. This type of assay<br>
generally requires a radiolabelled ligand to the RUP25 receptor. Absent the use of known<br>
ligands for the RUP25 receptor and radiolabels thereof, compounds of Formula (I) can be<br>
labelled with a radioisotope and used in an assay for evaluating the affinity of a test compound to<br>
the RUP25 receptor.<br>
A radiolabelled RUP25 compound of Formula (I) can be used in a screening assay to<br>
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e.,<br>
test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the "radiolabelled compound<br>
of Formula (I)" to the RUP25 receptor. Accordingly, the ability to compete with the "radio-<br>
labelled compound of Formula (I)" or Radiolabelled RUP25 Ligand for the binding to the<br>
RUP25 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity of the test compound to the RUP25<br>
receptor.<br>
ASSAY PROTOCOL FOR DETERMINING RECEPTOR BINDING FOR RUP25:<br>
A.	RUP25 RECEPTOR PREPARATION<br><br><br>
293 cells (human kidney, ATCC), transiently transfected with 10 ug human RUP25<br>
receptor and 60 ul Lipofectamine (per 15-cm dish), are grown in the dish for 24 hours (75%<br>
confluency) with a media change and removed with 10 ml/dish of Hepes-EDTA buffer ( 20mM<br>
Hepes + 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The cells are centrifuged in a Beckman Coulter centrifuge for<br>
20 minutes, 17,000 rpm (JA-25.50 rotor). Subsequently, the pellet is resuspended in 20 mM<br>
Hepes + 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 and homogenized with a 50- ml Dounce homogenizer and again<br>
centrifuged. After removing the supernatant, the pellets are stored at -80"C, until used in binding<br>
assay. When used in the assay, membranes are thawed on ice for 20 minutes and then 10 mL of<br>
incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCI2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) added. The membranes<br>
are vortexed to resuspend the crude membrane pellet and homogenized with a Brinkmann PT-<br>
3100 Polytron homogenizer for 15 seconds at setting 6. The concentration of membrane protein<br>
is determined using the BRL Bradford protein assay.<br>
B.	BINDING ASSAY<br>
For total binding, a total volume of 50ul of appropriately diluted membranes (diluted in<br>
assay buffer containing 50mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.4), lOmM MgCI2, and ImM EDTA; 5-50ug<br>
protein) is added to 96-well polyproylene microtiter plates followed by addition of lOOul of assay<br>
buffer and 50ul of Radiolabeled RUP25 Ligand. For nonspecific binding, 50 ul ofassay buffer<br>
is added instead of lOOul and an additional 50ul of lOuM cold RUP25 is added before 50ul of<br>
Radiolabeled RUP25 Ligand is added. Plates are then incubated at room temperature for 60-120<br>
minutes. The binding reaction is terminated by filtering assay plates through a Microplate<br>
Devices GF/C Unifilter filtration plate with a Brandell 96-well plate harvester followed by<br>
washing with cold 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4 containing 0.9% NaCl. Then, the bottom of the<br>
filtration plate are sealed, 50ul of Optiphase Supermix is added to each well, the top of the plates<br>
are sealed, and plates are counted in a Trilux MicroBeta scintillation counter. For compound<br>
competition studies, instead of adding lOOul ofassay buffer, lOOul of appropriately diluted test<br>
compound is added to appropriate wells followed by addition of 50 ul of Radiolabeled RUP25<br>
Ligand.<br>
C.	CALCULATIONS<br>
The test compounds are initially assayed at 1 and 0.1 u,M and then at a range of<br>
concentrations chosen such that the middle dose would cause about 50% inhibition of a Radio-<br>
RUP25 Ligand binding (i.e., 1CS0). Specific binding in the absence of test compound (Bo) is the<br>
difference of total binding (BT) minus non-specific binding (NSB) and similarly specific binding<br>
(in the presence of test compound) (B) is the difference of displacement binding (BD) minus non-<br>
specific binding (NSB). lC5o is determined from an inhibition response curve, logit-log plot of %<br>
B/B0 vs concentration of test compound.<br>
K, is calculated by the Cheng and Prustoff transformation:<br><br><br>
K, = ICso/(l +[L]/KD)<br>
where [L] is the concentration of a Radio-RUP25 Ligand used in the assay and KD is the<br>
dissociation constant of a Radio-RUP25 Ligand determined independently under the same<br>
binding conditions.<br>
D.	ALTERNATIVE BINDING ASS,* Y PROCEDURE<br>
3H-Nicotinic acid binding competition assay.<br>
CHO-KI cells stably expressing the niacin receptor were used to make membrane for<br>
binding analysis. Cells were grown to-80% confluence ingrowth medium (F-12 Kaighn's<br>
modified medium (ATCC, #30-2004) containing 10%FBS (G1BCO, #10438-026), lmg/mlG418<br>
(G1BCO, # 10131 -027) and IX Pen-Strep (Sigma P-0871), harvested by scraping, and<br>
centrifuged at 12 000 X g, 4° Celsius, 10 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspendcd in harvest<br>
buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized with 4X10 second bursts of a<br>
12 mm Polytron homogenizer, setting 5. Lysate was centrifuged at 2 000 X g, 4°, 10 minutes to<br>
remove unlysed cells and nuclei, and the resulting supernatant centrifuged at 39 000 X g, 4°, 45<br>
minutes to pellet membranes. The resulting pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (20 mM<br>
HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), homogenized with 3 X 10 second bursts of a 12 mm Polytron,<br>
setting 4, and re-centrif'uged at 39 000 X g, 4°, 45 minutes. The resulting pellet was resuspended<br>
in wash buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen before use. The concentration of membrane proteins<br>
in this preparation was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay, with BSA as a standard.<br>
Equilibrium binding of 3H-nicotinic acid was performed in 96-well polypropylene plates.<br>
Reactions contained 140 u.1 membrane diluted in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM<br>
MgCI2, and 0.01% CHAPS; 15-30 j.ig membrane protein/assay), 20 u.1 test compounds diluted in<br>
assay buffer (compound stocks were in 100% DMSO; final DMSO concentration in the assay<br>
was 0.25%), and 40 u.1 250 nM tritiated niacin ([5, 6-3H] - nicotinic acid: American Radiolabeled<br>
Chemicals, Inc.,20 u.M in ethanol; final ethanol concentration in each assay was 1.5%). Non-<br>
specific binding was determined in the presence of 250 u,M unlabeled nicotinic acid. After<br>
mixing at 3-4 hours ai room temperature, reactions were filtered through Packard Unifilter GF/C<br>
plates using a Packard Harvester, and washed with 8 X 200 ul ice-cold binding buffer. Plates<br>
were dried overnight and their backs sealed using PerkinElmer tape designed for GF/C plates. 40<br>
u.1 PerkinElmer Microscint-20 scintillation fluid was added to each well, the tops sealed, and<br>
plates analyzed in a Packard TopCount scintillation counter.<br>
Caluclations were preformed as in C above.<br><br><br>
Certain compounds of the invention have an EC50 in the 3H-nicotinic acid binding<br>
competition assay within the range of about 10 to about 100 u.M. More advantageous<br>
compounds of the invention have an EC5U value in this assay within the range of about I to about<br>
10 |iM. Still more advantages compounds have an EC50 value in this assay of less than about 1<br>
uM.<br>
Example 7: Flushing via Laser Doppler<br>
Procedure - Male C57BI6 mice (~25g) are anesthetized using I Omg/ml/kg Nembutal<br>
sodium. When antagonists are to be administered they are co-injected with the Nembutal<br>
anesthesia. After ten minutes the animal is placed under the laser and the ear is folded back to<br>
expose the ventral side. The laser is positioned in the center of the ear and focused to an intensity<br>
of 8.4-9.0 V (with is generally ~4.5cm above the ear). Data acquisition is initiated with a 15 by<br>
15 image format, auto interval, 60 images and a 20sec time delay with a medium resolution. Test<br>
compounds are administered following the 10th image via injection into the peritoneal space.<br>
Images 1-10 are considered the animal's baseline and data is normalized to an average of the<br>
baseline mean intensities.<br>

Example 8: Inhibition of Free Fatty-Acid Production, in vivo, in Catheterized Male<br>
Sprague-Daly Rats<br>
Non-esterified free-fatty acid (NEFA) assays were done on serum derived from live,<br>
freely moving rats. Jugular vein catheters were surgically implanted into the jugular veins<br>
and the animals were allowed to recover at least 48hr post surgery. Food was removed from<br>
the animals approximately 16 hours prior to the assay. A draw of ~200ul blood was pulled<br>
from the catheter and represents the baseline NEFA serum sample. Drug was administered<br>
intra-peritoneally (IP) at various concentrations to individual rats and then ~200ul blood<br>
draws were pulled from the catheter at the indicated time points for further NEFA analysis.<br>
NEFA assays were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Wako<br>
Chemicals, USA; NEFA C) and free fatty acid concentrations were determined via regression<br>
analysis of a known standard curve (range of known free fatty acids). Data was analyzed<br>
using Excel and PrismGraph.<br>
