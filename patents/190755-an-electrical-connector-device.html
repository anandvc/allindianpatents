				<td>The present invention relates to an electrical connector device. The present invention also relates to a multiphase omnidirectional electrical connector forming an electrical joint between electrical power distribution cables or between a distribution cabinet and an electrical supply cable.<br>
In many industrial sectors, and in particular in the mining field, certain electrical machines, of the coal-cutting type for example, are supplied by means of a three-phase electric current at a voltage which may vary between 1,000 and 12,000 volts and whose magnitude may reach, or even exceed, 500 amps. The electrical supply cable used for such applications combines together the active conductors corresponding to the phases of the electric supply current. Often it also includes a plurality of auxiliary service and safety electrical conductors useful for the electrical supply of ancillary devices, for example lighting. The electrical supply cable, with a conventional length of 50 metres, has an external diameter often greater than 60 millimetres and a weight per unit length of the order of several kilograms per metre.<br>
The great weight of the electrical supply cable and the rigidity of the copper conductors of large cross-section still make it laborious to carry out the operations of connecting an industrial power supply line using a connector.<br>
In fact, the only electrical connectors known to date for carrying out the power connection operations are all of the position-indexing type, that is to say that it is necessary, in order to make the connection, to bring two reference marks into coincidence.<br>
However, the correct presentation of the plug, allowing it to be inserted into this type of connector, requires pivoting movements on either side of its longitudinal axis of symmetry and adjustment movements which are made difficult by the great weight of the cable and its torsional rigidity.<br>
These difficulties may be such that in the mining field the concerted efforts of three operators are often<br>
necessary in order to achieve the correct presentation of the plug of a position-indexing electrical connector with respect to the socket or to the other joining piece.<br>
The other major drawback of position-indexing electrical connectors resides in the fact that the mating pieces once inserted, one into the other, cannot be moved with respect to each other. In fact, after mating and during the operation of the machine supplied by the cable, it frequently happens that the latter twists. It then exerts on the connector elements high mechanical torsional stresses which the connector cannot avoid, which stresses can damage it and result in it being destroyed.<br>
The present invention therefore aims to remedy these major drawbacks by providing a multiphase omnidirectional electrical connector forming an electrical joint for electrical power distribution cables, without position indexing, between the two pieces making up the joint.<br>
According to the invention, the front face of the plug may be arranged facing the front face of the socket or the other joining piece of the connector and inserted into this socket or this joining piece in the same movement, independently of the relative position of the said plug with respect to the other joining piece.<br>
According to a novel result, the connection of an industrial electrical machine, for example a coal cutter for coal mines, to a, for example, three-phase electrical supply circuit by means of a power cable and of the omnidirectional electrical connector according to the invention is greatly facilitated. In particular, it is no longer necessary to impart on the connector plug left or right pivoting movements about its longitudinal axis of symmetry, so as to bring it into a predetermined position with respect to the socket or to the other joining piece of the connector, before connecting it. This thus avoids having to twist the electrical power distribution cable, an operation made extremely difficult by its weight and especially its rigidity, thereby allowing a single<br>
operator to connect, without particular effort, an industrial electrical power machine to an electrical supply circuit or two electrical power distribution cables, arranged one in the axial extension of the other. According to a complementary characteristic of the present invention, a device is also provided for fastening the electrical power distribution cable, intended to prevent any mechanical traction force exerted on the cable from being transferred to the internal connections of the omnidirectional electrical connector.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for an electrical connector device forming a multiphase electrical joint between electrical power distribution cables or between a distribution cabinet and a supply cable (31) of an apparatus or of a machine, formed by two joining pieces fitting together, one in the other, one of which is a male or female plug (2) protected by an external cylindrical shell (13) joined to a corresponding complementary plug or to a female or male socket (1) by a threaded assembling bush (10), the cable (31) being prevented from moving by a fastening chuck (65) forced into a position of being clamped against the cable (31) by the movement of a conical ramp (78) pushed along the chuck (65) by the axial assembling force, characterized in that each corresponding male or female piece, the male or female plug (2) or the female or male socket (1) forming the joint, is composed of an insulating hollow contact-carrying body (11, 12) formed by a coaxial alteration of tubular cylindrical partitions (14, 15, 16, 17) separated by cylindrical cavities (18, 19) and formed by at least two conducting rings (22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27) each connected to one of the phases and arranged coaxially on the inner and outer walls of the cylindrical partitions (14, 15, 16, 17) of the hollow contact-carrying bodies (11, 12) and in that, for two facing rings, one of them carries an intermediate contact piece (54) , each conducting ring (22, 24, 26) being intended to come into electrical contact with a corresponding ring (23, 25, 27) brought into position and then located opposite each other when the two, male and female, joining pieces (1, 2) are fitted together, one in the other, so that the intermediate piece between two rings corresponding to the same phase is the contact piece (54), in that each conducting ring (22, 23, 24) has a side extension (45, 46, 47) serving as a connection terminal (39, 40, 41) for the end of a power conductor of the cable (31) and in that the earth braids (57) arranged round each of the conductors (28, 29, 30) of the cable (31) and under its jacket are connected in the socket (1) and in the plug (2) to a metal ring (59) and are taken up electrically and then carried over onto the side wall of the body of the socket (1) or of the plug (2) .<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The technical characteristics and other advantages of the invention will be more apparent in the following description, given by way of non-limiting example, of an embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
• Figure 1 is a so-called exploded longitudinal perspective view showing the succession of main internal pieces forming a plug of the electrical connector according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an identical view to that of Figure 1, showing the separated elements of that portion of Figure 1 identified by a horizontal line segment; Figure 3 is a longitudinal section of the connector according to the invention, along its longitudinal axis of symmetry;<br>
Figure 4 is an identical view to that of Figure 1, showing the pieces forming the outer shell of the plug body;<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of the end of the plug of the connector according to the invention, with partial cutaway allowing the internal arrangement to be seen;<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view, in the separated state, of a contact-carrying ring and its band with contact blades;<br>
Figure 7 is a composite view, in plan of a linear portion laid flat on one of the bands providing the electrical contact and its cross-section at one contact blade.<br>
The omnidirectional electrical connector according to the invention is intended to allow connection between an electrical power distribution cable and a supply cable or between a distribution cabinet and a supply cable, the said cable including, in addition to active conductors for the supply currents, auxiliary conductors for safety and service electrical signals, for example, for monitoring, controlling or supplying of ancillary devices, lighting or other requirements.<br>
The connector according to the invention is split up into two assemblies, or complementary joining pieces called hereinbelow the "plug" and the "socket". Each of these two assemblies comprises a few component elements which are identical or similar.<br>
The connector according to the invention is generally composed of two joining pieces 1 and 2, for example a socket 1 as shown in Figure 1 and a plug 2. These two complementary pieces form, when joined together, the electrical joint between a supply cable and a distribution cabinet or between two cables.<br>
The socket 1 has a cylindrical metal body 3 mounted on a support casing 4 using a fixing device 5 such as a mounting flange, for example a square mounting flange with a flat bearing surface, or another type of mounting flange. The latter has holes for the passage of the fixing elements 6, such as bolts or studs with nuts or other means allowing the body 3 of the socket 1 to be immovably fastened to the support casing 4.<br>
On either side of the device 5 for fixing to the support casing 4, the body 3 of the socket 1 forms two, front 7 and rear 8, tubular cylindrical projections. On its outer periphery, the front tubular projection 7 has a thread 9 provided for mounting a threaded assembly bush 10 allowing the body 3 of the socket 1 to be mechanically assembled to the plug 2 (Figure 3 and 4).<br>
The internal volume of the front tubular cylindrical projection 7 contains an insulating internal tubular hollow contact-carrying body 12 intended to be fitted into a complementary insulating internal tubular<br>
hollow contact-carrying body 11 contained in a shell 13 of the plug 2.<br>
Each of the internal tubular hollow contact-carrying bodies 11 and 12 is shaped identically by the radial succession of coaxial cylindrical tubular partitions, there being two of them for example, respectively the plug and socket inner tubular partitions 14 and 15 and the plug and socket outer tubular partitions 16 and 17, delimiting plug and socket cylindrical cavities 18 and 19 between them. This succession terminates at the centre, for the plug, in a cylindrical central well 20 used for ancillary contacts and, for the socket, in a receiving sleeve 21.<br>
The inner and outer walls of the inner tubular partition 14 of the plug 2 are each lined with an inner conducting ring 22 and with an outer conducting ring 23, while its outer partition 16 only has an inner conducting ring 24 on its inner wall.<br>
The inner and outer walls of the outer tubular partition 17 of the socket are each lined with an inner conducting ring 25 and with an outer conducting ring 26, while its inner partition 15 only has an outer conducting ring 27 on its outer wall.<br>
The tubular partitions have conducting rings set in them for example, that is to say each ring is embedded in a groove existing in the corresponding side wall. For fitting-travel reasons, the grooves are located at a sufficient distance from the common front face of the tubular partitions.<br>
The number of tubular partitions depends on the number of phases of the supply current. For a three-phase current, the number of partitions is equal to two, both for the socket 1 and for the plug 2.<br>
As will be seen hereinbelow, the conducting rings of the plug 2 are each connected to the end of one of the power conductors, such as 28, 29 and 30, of a supply cable 31. The same applies to the socket 1, just one power conductor 32 of which is visible in Figure 3.<br>
Each insulating internal tubular hollow body 11<br>
or 12 of the plug 2 or socket 1 has, on its rear end, three access slots, such as 33, 34 and 35, uniformly spaced on the rear outer perimeter and delimited by three sections 36, 37 and 38 for access to terminals 39, 40 and 41 for connecting the conducting rings to the power conductors 28, 29 and 30 of the supply cable 31. For this purpose, as may be seen in the figures and more particularly in Figure 6, each of the connection terminals is formed by a U-clamp, such as 42, 43 or 44, constituting the end of a lateral extension piece, such as 45, 46 or 47, that each of the conducting rings has. The ends of the power conductors 28, 29 and 30 are fixed to the connection terminals 39, 40 and 41 conventionally by means of nut-and-bolt assemblies, such as 48, 49 or 50.<br>
As may be seen in Figure 2, the conducting rings 22, 23 and 24 of the plug 2 are angularly offset between them by a value sufficient to allow good separation of the conductors 28, 29 and 30 and of the terminals 39, 40 and 41, as well as a degree of ease in making the connection.<br>
The same applies for the conducting rings 25, 26 and 27 of the socket 1, although this configuration is not shown in the figures.<br>
As regards the insulating tubular hollow body 11 of the plug 2, some of the conducting rings have a groove on their inner face while others are solid and have smooth side faces. By way of example, referring more particularly to Figure 3, only the conducting ring 23 arranged on the outer wall of the inner tubular partition 14 is solid and smooth. The two other conducting rings 22 and 24 have a peripheral groove 51 and 52 in their inner side face. Complementarily, the conducting ring 26 of the socket 1 has a peripheral groove 53 in its inner side face.<br>
As regards the insulating tubular hollow body 12 of the socket 1, some of the rings similarly have a peripheral groove on their inner face, while others are solid and have smooth side faces. By way of example, in the embodiment shown, only the inner ring 26 of the outer<br>
partition 17 has such a groove. The alternation is the reverse to that existing on the plug 2 so as to establish, between the plug 2 and the socket 1, an electrical joint contact between the conducting rings by the interposition of an intermediate contacting piece housed in these grooves. A correspondence therefore exists with respect to each other between the solid rings and the grooved rings.<br>
Of course, the peripheral groove existing in the inner face of the rings may equally well be moved onto the outer face of the rings in question.<br>
The actual electrical contact is made by an intermediate contacting piece 54, for example of the multicontact type, establishing the electrical link between two corresponding rings of the two complementary joint pieces, the socket 1 and plug 2, when they are fitted together.<br>
This intermediate contacting piece 54, of annular general shape, is embeddedly housed in the peripheral grooves of the conducting rings.<br>
One particular embodiment of this multicontact intermediate piece 54 will now be examined with reference to the composite Figure 7.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, each multicontact intermediate piece 54 has the shape of a metal band with separate and slightly domed contact blades 55. This piece is formed, for example, from and in a metal strip perforated, when flat, with transverse separating slits 56 distributed over the entire circular periphery. The width of these slits 56 is less than the width of the strip so that two successive slits 56 delimit a metal spacing between them. The strip is slightly curved in order to make them appear domed or arched when it is made into the form of the band and to provide these bridges of material with a spring effect, these bridges of material being intended to constitute an omnidirectional distribution of the electrical-contact blades 55 that will come into mechanical bearing contact on the facing smooth side face of each corresponding<br><br>
conducting ring.<br>
In accordance with the invention, these characteristics allow an omnidirectional character to be conferred on the elementary electrical joint of each phase.<br>
The earth braids 57 arranged around the conductors and under the jacket of the cable 31 are brought together and connected to an earth terminal 58 built into a metal ring 59 mounted in the bottom of the body 3 of the socket I and in that of the plug 2. The electrical link is established between this ring 59 and the corresponding side wall of the socket 1 or of the plug 2.<br>
The continuity of the earth connection between the socket 1 and the plug 2 is obtained by the assembling bush 10 and by means of a metal band 60 inserted into a peripheral groove made on the inner side surface of the front projection 7 of the body 3 of the socket 1.<br>
Moreover, a metal ring, also referenced 59, of the socket 1 keeps the tubular internal body 12 of the socket 1 butted up against an internal shoulder.<br>
The service or safety conductors, called auxiliary conductors 61, are individually connected inside the body of the plug 2 to superposed rings 62 mounted in succession with interposition of insulating rings 63 on a central pin 64 laying in the central well 20 of the internal tubular hollow body 11 of the plug 2. The end of this pin 64 forms an additional contact for a conductor of a control circuit.<br>
The central pin 64 fits into the sleeve 21 provided in the central part of the body 3 of the socket 1. Provided on the side surface of this sleeve 21 are contact rings separated by insulating rings corresponding respectively to the rings 62 and 63 of the pin 64 for establishing transverse electrical links completed by the end link through the end contacts.<br>
The supply cable 31 is held in position by a fastening chuck 65, shown in Figure 1, this chuck having multiple jaws 66.<br>
The body of the plug 2 contains, in its lower<br>
end, an end seal device 27 of the gland type shown after the fastening chuck 65, on the side where the jaws 66 are in the sectional view. This device 67 consists of a sealing ring 68 made of deformable material 69 sandwiched between two pressure washers, an end washer 70 and a bearing washer 71. A force-transferring ring 72 stressed, in axial thrust, by a lock nut 73 mounted at the end of the body 3 of the plug 2 bears on the bearing washer 71. All these pieces constitute the gland-type end sealing device 67, providing suitable sealing and isolation with respect to the medium external to the connector.<br>
Shown in Figure 4 is the threaded assembling bush 10 which allows the body of the plug 2 to be mechanically connected to the body 3 of the socket 1. The inner surface of that end of the threaded assembling bush 10 located on the side of the body 3 of the plug 1 has a thread provided for it to be engaged on the threaded part of the front cylindrical projection 7 of the body 3 of the socket 1. The threaded assembling bush 10 is prevented from rotating by the elastic compressive force of a metal retention ring 74 mounted in a groove in the projection 7. In addition, the bush 10 has through-holes, such as 75, intended for the insertion of full dog-point screws, such as 76, and for access to the latter, in order to prevent the assembly from pivoting.<br>
The fastening chuck 65, the rear face of which butts up against the end of the internal tubular body 11 of the plug 2, is itself covered by a cover 77 having an inner profile with a conical ramp 78 consisting, for example, of a succession of cylindrical and frusto-conical segments arranged alternately.<br>
The peripheral end rim, formed by the lateral succession of the ends of the jaws 66 of the fastening chuck 65, has a frustoconical general shape. The jaws 66 are stressed, in concentric clamping around the cable 31, by the movement from the axial forward motion of the conical ramp 78 of the cover 77 against the end of the jaws. The clamping of the jaws 66 of the fastening chuck 65 on the outer jacket of the cable 31 will be achieved<br>
by screwing the cover 77 onto the thread of the assembling bush, which completely immobilizes the cable 31 so as to prevent a mechanical stress, to which it may foe subjected, from being transferred to the connection terminals 39, 40 and 41. On the other hand, left or right pivoting motions of the plug 2 of the connector with respect to the socket 1 or to the other joining piece are possible. The only consequence of the supply cable 31 being twisted under the effect, for example, of vibrations of the electrical machine supplied is the relative pivoting of the two elements making up the connector, without any effect on the mechanical or electrical properties of the joint.<br>
The gland-type end sealing device 67 is inserted into a threaded neck 79 delimited by the rear internal volume of the cover 77 and closed off by the nut 73 mounted on the thread of the neck 79 of the cover 77 for the purpose of compressing all the pieces forming the gland against the internal profile with the internal conical ramp 78 (Figure 3) of the threaded neck 79 of the cover 77.<br>
Limit-stop shoulders, existing both on the outer shell of the plug 2 and on the bottom of the inner side face of the front projection 7 constituting the entrance of the socket 1, limit the extent of fitting penetration and bring the contacts specific to the same phase into coincidence.<br>
The tubular hollow contact-carrying bodies 11 and 12 are prevented from moving longitudinally by appropriate housing-bottom shoulders and thus held in abutment in order to allow the axial fitting and unfitting movements when using the connector.<br>
Finally, we note that the cover 77 is connected to the body of the plug 2 by screwing onto the rear outer surface of the body of the plug 2. It is stopped in abutment against a shoulder 80 made on the outer surface of the body of the plug 2 and it is prevented from loosening by itself by three full dog-point headless screws 76, which are arranged radially around the cover<br>
77 and the dog points of which penetrate into a circular groove 81 machined in the external periphery of the body of the plug 2.<br>
It will also be noted that two spigots 82, for preventing pivoting movement of the fastening chuck 65, are inserted into passages in the body of the plug 2.<br><br><br><br>
