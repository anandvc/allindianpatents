This invention relates to the development and performance of a new bearing box assembly for use in scrap steel and re-rolling mills. Steel rods of different diameters, in the range of 6mm to 16mm, are extensively used in the construction industry and other industrial applications. Presently rolls of rolling mills are mounted on a gun metal chokes at both ends of the roll, (For example a standard 6" rolling mill with a 6 metric tones fly wheel consists of five stands). The typical power consumption of such a conventional scrap steel re-rolling mill is very high; i.e. between 150 h.p. to 250 h.p.<br>
The feed stock for the re-rolling mill, the scrap steel, is heated to red hot condition in a fired furnace, in order to obtain the end product i.e. rod of desired diameter. As stated above, the rolls are supported at either ends in gun metal chokes. In a typical gun metal choke, four gun metal keys are fitted in all four inner sides of a choke and a roll is mounted on two of such chokes. The choke has no feature for alignment in conventional re-rolling mills. There is also metal to metal contact between gun metal keys and roll. The gun metal choke is also a stationary one.<br>
Following are some of the disadvantages and problems of gun metal chokes in scrap steel re-rolling mills:<br>
a. Direct metal to metal contact between the gun metal keys and roll neck which results in wear and tear of the soft gun metal keys, and consequent misalignment which leads to frequent stoppage of the mill, almost once in three hours, and then the cost of production goes up.<br><br>
b. And the power consumption of conventional gun metal choke is high, due to the use of gun metals keys, instead of bearing. And chokes are not properly designed.<br>
There is no proper and correct provision for lubrication.<br>
d.   Due to friction the rolls get damaged, and quality of the finished product is not appreciable.<br>
Thus in a conventional scrap steel re-rolling mill gun metal chokes and keys leads to wastage of time which lands the entrepreneurs in frustration. It is therefore the object of this invention is to provide a novel bearing box assembly which provides an informed qualitative iron rolls and while using the said invention, the entrepreneur incurs least possible expenditure in terms of technology and cost. It is another objective of this invention to provide an alternate means which is more efficient and more flexible and also less cumbersome to determine optimum qualitative and quantitative iron rolls compared to the conventional choke method conventionally used in the Scrap Steel re-rolling mills.<br>
This was conceived on the idea of replacing the conventional gun metal choke with a new, apt modern alternate means to conventional choke and developed after extensive trials carried out by using different types of bearings, during the development stage the inventor selected the choice of taper roller bearings.<br><br>
The operation and performance of the invention will now be described in greater details with respect to the accompanying drawing The exploded view of the invention is also shown in the accompanying drawing. The selection of bearing plays an important role in the operation of this invention; ball bearings, double ball bearings, double row spherical bearing are not suitable to this invention as they do not have either self alignment capacity, or load bearing capacity, or both; hence this new invention which employs the use of two numbers of taper roller bearings which are organised to be in contact with each other at their rear ends. Each tapered roller bearing has separate inner and outer bearings. This new device obviates the need for frequent stoppage of the rolling mill as it has excellent self-alignment capability provided by the holding plates mounted on the projections provided at the left and right exterior of the present invention, thereby improving the productivity, and also the power consumption is reduced about 40%, when the new invention is used and quality of the product is also maintained uniformly.<br>
The bearing is organised in the housing and housing is covered by a cover plate. Now the housing including the bearings is mounted on mounting plates through two projection means. Thereby the housing becomes rotatable and gets self-alignment capability with its pair in the roll mounted on the stand of the mill.<br><br>
The installed capacity of the inventors' own re-rolling mill is 80 metric tone per month (i.e.4 metric tone per day). With the conventional gun mental chokes he was able to get only 3.5 MT per month, with 4 numbers of 3 high stands and the number of stands and it's height can be increased according to the requirement. Frequent breakage of gun metal keys delay the process. Due to this delay, the raw material which comes out of furnace loses its temperature, and hence it should be again heated up to 1200 degree Celsius (red hot), which results in loss of power and more power is consumed. Average production per day was 380 kg/. Then, the inventor took the choice of taper roller bearing box assembly and incorporated the present invention in place of gunmetal choke in the field of steel scrap re-rolling mills.<br>
Detailed description of the present invention<br>
The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The organisation and the manner of operation of the invention together with the further objects and advantages thereof may best be understood by reference in the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is the perspective view of a scrap steel re-rolling mill incorporating the present invention 12 ;<br>
Figure 2 is the view of one among the plurality of stand members 11 in which the present invention 12 is incorporated and used in the scrap steel re-rolling mills.<br>
Figure 3 is the view of one among the plurality of rolls mounted on the stand member 11 incorporating the present invention 12, at its both ends;<br><br>
Figure 4 is the view of the individual unit of tine present invention;<br>
Figure 5 is the exploded view of the present invention 12.<br>
While the invention will be described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention of that embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalent as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
The motor member (1) of the scrap steel re-rolling mill is fitted with the v-belt pulley member (2) attached with the motor member (1) is also rotating and the v-belt pulley member (2) is connected with the v-belt pulley member (4) by means of plurality of v-belt members(3). V-belt pulley member{4) is connected with a fly wheel member(7) by means of a shaft member(5) and the fly wheel member (7) is fixed with two bearing members (6).<br>
The fly wheel member(7) is coupled with a pinion gear box member(9) including three gears, of which the middle gear rotates in the clock wise direction and the top and bottom gears rotate in the anti-clock wise direction, the pinion gear box member(9) and the fly wheel member(7) are coupled by a gear coupling means(8).<br><br>
The gear box member(9) is coupled with the shaft of the middle roll member(13 ) mounted on the first among the plurality of stand member(11) by means of plurality of spindle coupling member(10) . Plurality of stand members(11) and plurality of roll members(13) are already existing in the field of scrap steel re-rolling mills. The aforesaid plurality of roll members(13) are mounted on the plurality of stand members(11). When the mill is driven the rolls are rotating and due to metal to metal contact the wear and tear is more and the capacity of the motor to drive the mill is also very high. Further when the mill is driven, due to the metal to metal contact, the rolls get damaged; and the mill has to be kept idle for hours and which result in heavy loss. In order to over come these difficulties the present invention a bearing box assembly member(12) is incorporated in place of gunmetal chokes.<br>
The present invention, the bearing box assembly may be described in greater details with accompanying drawing f ig-5.<br>
The present invention a bearing box assembly(12) is comprising of a housing member(14) with closed back side, open and securable front side, two projection means(17) at the left and right exterior in which two tapered roller bearing members(18) are organised in such a manner to be in contact with each other at their rear ends; and the two tapered roller bearing members(18) are rotating in the same direction in which each roll member(13) is roiling. The two tapered roller bearing members(18) do have separate inner bearing member (19) and outer bearing member(20). After organising the tvv'o tapered roller bearing members(18) as described above manner in the housing member (14), the housing member(14) is covered with means cover plate member(15) at it's front side through plurality of bolt members(21), plurality of nut members(22), and washer members(23) as shown in fig-5.<br><br>
The present invention(12), comprising of two tapered roller bearing member(18) organised in such a manner to be in contact with each other at their rear ends including a housing member(14), is mounted by means of mounting plate members(16) with the provision of two projection members(17) provided in the left and right exterior of the housing member(14) to obtain self-alignment capability with it's pair mounted at the other end of all the plurality of roll member(13 of fig 3) mounted on the stand member(11).<br>
When the motor is driven, due to the self-alignment capability of the present invention member(12) when incorporated in plurality in the place of the gun metal choke, as shown in fig 3, the rolls rotate without any hurdles and as such the production goes up. Not only this the capacity of the motor to drive a scrap steel rolling mill can drastically be reduced by incorporating this invention and power is also saved.<br>
The raw material scrap steel at red hot condition is fed in between the middle and bottom roll members(13) mounted on the stand members(11) of the mill and the raw material so fed is pressed and again fed in between the top and middle roll members(13) and again pressed. The process continues till the raw material attains the predetermined quality and dimension. The middle roll is rotating in the clock wise direction: and the top and bottom rolls rotate in the anti-clock wise direction. The present invention v/hen employed in the process gains importance because of it's self alignment capability with it is pair at the each end as shown in fig 3.<br><br><br>
