				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for measuring the exchange area between a reagent and the wall of a housing.<br>
The invention is in the field of metrology and more particularly in the field of measurements of heat amounts. Its object is a method to estimate the power of a thermal reaction inside housing, such as that of a reactor of a calorimeter. Another of its objects is a device for carrying out such a method.<br>
It is recalled that it is common to estimate and analyze thermal reactions occurriag inside housing. These thermal reactions are caused, for example, by chemical reactions of a reagent, or. by the heat produced by biological reactions, such as those resulting from the activity of microorganisms, or by physical reactions, such as those resulting from crystallization or from the form transition of polymorphic substances, or finally by voluntary productions of energy, such as nuclear reactions.<br>
More particularly, considering a calorimeter, the housing is placed in a thermally controlled environment, so as to maintain a reagent contained inside the housing at a desired temperature. This reagent is maintained in an agitated state, through the use of an agitation organ or by imparting a movement to the housing itself. The means for maintaining at a desired temperature are, for example, obtained by means of a jacket surrounding the housing for the circulation of a thermostatted heat-transfer fluid.<br>
The evolution and analysis of the thermal reaction inside the housing aims more particularly at deterrnining its power and the heat exchange coefficient between the wall of the housing and the reagent.<br>
A first known technique consists in measuring internal and external temperatures of the housing by means of thermometers. The power of the thermal reaction takes into account the difference between the two measured temperatures, the exchange surface and the heat exchange coefficient between the reagent and the wall of the housing.<br><br>
According to this technique, the exchange surface is estimated approximately and the heat exchange coefficient is determined beforehand through calibration by plunging a heating electric resistance in the reagent. One may refer, for example, to U.S. Patent No. 5,174,655 to Wilfried Lite et al.<br>
A first drawback of this technique resides in the fact that the exchange surface is taken into account arbitrarily by approximate estimation in accordance with the level of the reagent in a quiet state inside the housing. This results in an approximation detrimental to the reliability and exactness of the obtained result regarding the determination of the power of the thermal reaction.<br>
A second drawback resides in the inadequate use of a means for heating the reagent before its agitation, with, either undesirable consequences on the physical chemical characteristics of the reagent before the reaction under study, either the preliminary step of determining the coefficient by a specific calibration procedure.<br>
A second known technique consists in using a heating resistance placed in the heat-transfer fluid circulating between the housing and its jacket. When the reaction under study is exothermic, the heating resistance produces less heat to maintain the reagent temperature constant. The power of the reaction is then estimated from the corresponding power reduction of the heating resistance. One may refer, for example, lo U.S. Patent No. 4,130,016 to Lynn C. Walker.<br>
A first major drawback of this technique is that it is not applicable to endothermic reactions.<br>
A second drawback resides in the thermal inertia of the housing against a possible analysis of fast and/or large amplitude thermal variations.<br>
A third technique consists in proceeding to a thermal balance in the circulation zone of the heat-transfer fluid. To this effect, for example, a condenser is used in which the heat-transfer fluid condenses after heating. The measurement of the amount of fluid condensed makes it possible to determine the power of the thermal reaction. One may refer, for example, to European Patent EP 0275042 (Westinghouse Electric Corporation).<br><br>
A drawback of this technique resides in the imprecision of the analysis of the thermal reaction inside the housing, estimated through the heat-transfer fluid, which incorporates approximations in measurements, in particularly with respect to cumulated thermal losses between the housing and the means used to proceed to the thermal balance.<br>
In addition, here also, it results in an approximation detrimental to the reliability and exactness of the obtained result regarding the determination of the power of the thermal reaction.<br>
The general aim of the present invention is to propose a method to estimate continuously, in real time, in a reliable and precise manner, the power of the thermal reaction inside housing and the heat exchange coefficient between the reagent and this housing. Another aim of the invention is to propose a device to carry out this method.<br>
In a general manner, the inventive thought process of the present invention has consisted in proposing a method and its device for carrying it out to determine in a precise and reliable manner, in real time and continuously, the exchange surface between the reagent and the housing, so as to finally make it possible to analyze in the same conditions the characteristics of the housing and of the thermal reaction under study.<br>
This thought process has more particularly consisted in abandoning the habits used in the field, and in using heat flux sensors to determine in a precise, reliable manner, continuously and in real time, the exchange surface between the reagent and the housing.<br>
It results from this thought process that, starting from the use of simple means constituted by heat flux sensors, it is made possible to analyze a thermal reaction, either endothermic or exothermic, and reactions during which the physical-chemical properties of the reagent are likely to evolve rapidly and/or with important amplitudes.<br><br>
In addition, it is made possible to analyze, continuously and in real time, a thermal reaction inside housing with variations caused voluntarily to the temperature of the reagent, so as to study its evolution.<br>
Thanks to such an unusual exploitation of the heat flux sensors, such as thermopiles providing logical data in voltage, it is made possible to obtain reliable measurements of heat flux through the wall of the housing, which makes it possible to calculate in a precise manner, continuously and in real time, with the use of automated digital computing means, firstly, the level of reagent inside the housing, secondly, the exchange surface between the reagent and the wall of the housing, then the thermal power transmitted by the housing, and the heat exchange coefficient between the reagent and the wall of the housing, and lastly, the power and energy of the thermal reaction.<br>
Another advantageous result of the invention will be noted, which resides in the absence of a preliminary calibration, as in the prior art, for the means used to carry out the method of the invention, i.e., the sensors for measuring the heat flux.<br>
Beyond calorimetry, a need has appeared which resides in the precise and reliable knowledge, continuously and in real time, of the level of a liquid contained in a housing, which may be assimilated to a reagent of the type discussed above as far as its thermal evolution is concerned.<br>
Another result attained by the present invention is to propose a method and its device for carrying it out which make it possible to measure, between two given instants to and ti, the distance variation, following a thermal reaction, considered between any two points of a reagent contained in the housing at the time to and ti.<br>
Particular applications of the implementation of the method of the invention consist in particular in measuring the spontaneous variation of the actual level h of a reagent contained in a housing, in particular a security threshold, following natural variations or variations triggered by the environment outside this housing, such as a storage tank of a delicate product, or also the dilatometry of the material.<br><br>
According to the present invention, it is proposed a method for determining an<br>
exchange area A between a reagent and the wall of a housing containing this reagent,<br>
in order to determine in particular the power Pr of a thermal reaction inside the<br>
housing and the heat exchange coefficient U between the reagent and the housing<br>
wall.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, the method proposed consists in measuring a first heat flux F1 per surface unit selected in a zone of the wall in secure contact with the reagent, measuring a second heat flux F2 per surface unit selected in a zone of the wall in secure absence of contact with the reagent, measuring a third heat flux F3 per surface unit selected in a zone of the wall comprising in a continuous overlapping manner both any zone of the wall in secure contact with the reagent next to any zone of the wall in secure absence of contact with the reagent, and then calculating, proportionally between the measurements of the first, second, and third heat flux which have been carried out, the actual level h of the reagent inside the housing.<br>
These dispositions are such that, from the calculated actual level h of the reagent, and, with respect to any given geometry of the housing, the real exchange area A between the reagent and the wall of the housing containing this reagent can be determined, continuously and in real time.<br>
According to another aspect of the method proposed by the invention, the power Pt transmitted by the housing can be determined by measuring the first heat flux Fi per surface unit and by determining the said exchange area A between the reagent and the wail of the housing, preferentially by the method discussed above with respect to a first aspect of the invention.<br>
These dispositions are such that the power Pt transmitted by the housing can be calculated continuously and in real time, with a precision and a reliability preferentially obtained from those of the exchange area A, starting from the measurement of the first heat flux F1 per surface unit, scaled to the totality of the exchange area A between the reagent A and the wall of the housing.<br><br>
Starting from the reliable data collected by the method of the invention, it is next proposed, in a secondary step, to determine the heat exchange coefficient U between the reagent and the wall of the housing by measuring the temperature Tr of the reagent and the temperature Te of the wall of the housing, by determining the real exchange area A between the reagent and the wall of the housing, and by calculating the power Pt transmitted by the housing.<br>
These dispositions are such that the heat exchange coefficient U between the reagent and the wall of the housing can be calculated continuously and in real time, with a precision and reliability obtained from those of the exchange area A, preferentially determined by the general method of the invention.<br>
It will be understood that the heat exchange coefficient U between the reagent and the wall of the housing is then calculated in a manner known to the person of the art, from the power Pt transmitted by the housing, the thermal exchange area A between the reagent and the wall of the housing, and the temperature difference between the temperature of the reagent and the temperature of the wall of the housing.<br>
It will be noted, however, that an advantageous result specific to the implementation of the method of the invention resides in the direct determination of the heat exchange coefficient between the reagent and the wall of the housing, without preliminary step likely to disturb the reagent.<br>
Another result of the dispositions of the invention is a monitoring, continuously and in real time, of the modifications of the physical-chemical properties of the reagent, such as, for example, an increase in its viscosity during the thermal reaction under study.<br>
Finally, another result of these dispositions is the possibility of simulating with great precision thermal reactions in reactors of a larger size.<br><br>
Starting from the reliable data collected by the method of the invention, the power Pr of the reaction is determined by measuring the evolution of the reagent temperature during the time of the reaction, by determining the power Pt transmitted by the housing, and by estimating the thermal losses of the housing. These thermal losses, commonly named "sky losses of the housing", are elements known to the person of the art.<br>
These dispositions are such that the power Pr of the reaction can be calculated, continuously and in real time, with a precision and reliability obtained from those of the exchange area A, preferentially determined by the general method of the invention.<br>
It will be understood that the power Pr of the reaction can be calculated in the manner known to the person of the art, from the mass and the physical-chemical characteristics of the reagent, the evolution of the temperature Tr of the reagent as a function of time, the power Pt transmitted by the housing, and the thermal losses of the housing.<br>
It will be understood also that the energy of the reaction is obtained, in the manner known to the person of the art, by integration as a function of time of the power of the reaction measured continuously during the thermal reaction.<br>

According to a particular organization of the device of the invention in calorimetry, this device also comprises a jacket surrounding the housing for the circulation of a fluid around this housing, the fluid being thermostatted by heat-producing means, so as to maintain the housing at a desired temperature.<br>
Still according to this organization, the device of the invention comprises preferentially a first temperature sensor placed inside the housing to measure the temperature TV of the reagent, and a second temperature sensor placed inside the jacket to measure the temperature Te of the wall of the housing, obtained in particular from the measurement of the temperature of the heat-transfer fluid inside the jacket, in the manner known to the person of the art.<br>
