				<td>A   PROCESS   FOR   PREPARING   9-[(DIMETHYLAMINO)-METHYL]-10-HYDROXYCAMPTOTHECIN (TOPOTECAN) FROM 10-HYDROXY- 4-(S) CAMPTOTHECIN Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing of 9-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (topotecan) from 10-hydroxy-4-(S) camptothecin. The invention discloses the rationale use of dichloromethane under solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis, which can behave both as solvent and a reactant when it serves as a source for C-1 unit for amino-alkylation of l0-hydroxy-4- (S) camptothecin.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Topotecan (TFT) [9-(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-hydroxy- (4S)-camptothecin) which is of the chemical structure of Formula I, is under clinical trials and its chemotherapeutic efficacy appears to be very promising. (Slichenmyer, W.J., Rowinsky, E.K., Donehower, R.C., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 85:271 1993) Topotecan is one of the new class agents those targets topoisomerase I (Topo I) and stabilize the DNA-Topo-1 complex, ultimately resulting in the cell death. The rationale for the use of Topotecan in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is based on the finding of Top-I being elevated in the lymphocytes of patients with this disease (O'Brien, S., Kantarjian, H., Ellis, A., Zwelling, L., Estey, E., Keating, M., Cancer, 75 (5) 104-1995).<br>
Camptothecin and congeners represent a clinically very useful class of anticancer agents. The discovery that the (S) enantiomer of camptothecin (CPT), a compound isolated from the bark, leaves and fruit of Camptotheca acuminata, can kill cell through selective poisoning of the human enzyme topoisomerase-I bound to its substrate DNA, was important breakthrough for its development as an anticancer<br><br><br>
agent, The intact 20-(S)-lactone form of CPT first isolated over 30 years ago, (Wall,<br>
M.E., Wani, M. C., Cooke, C. E., Palmer, K.H., McPhail, A.T., J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>
88 3888 1966) can bind non-covalently to the complex formed by topoisomerase-I<br>
and DNA thus inhibiting the resealing of broken DNA backbone . The intrinsic ability<br>
of CPT to trap this complex has been clearly linked to antitumor activity especially<br>
for tumors over-expressing topoisomerase-I such as colorectal and cervical cancer<br>
(Tahimoto, C.H., Wright, H.J., Arbuck, S.G., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1400 107<br>
1998 and Iyer, L., Ratain, M.J., Cancer Chemotherapy Pharamcol 42 31 1998).<br>
Nanomolar concentrations of the drug are in fact sufficient to cause DNA damage in<br>
vivo, which becomes irreversible following its collision with DNA processing<br>
machineries. This collision event produces irreparable damage to the DNA (Hsiang,<br>
Y.H., Lihou, M.G., Liu, L.F., Cancer Res. 49 5077 1989) and finally results in cell<br>
death (Tsao, Y.P., Arpa, D., Liu, L.F., Cancer Res. 52 1823 1992 and Holm, C.,<br>
Covey, J. M., Kerrigan, D., Pommier, Y., Cancer Res. 49 6365 1989). CPT is not an<br>
optimal drug as it exhibits very limited water solubility in addition to severe toxicity<br>
and erratic absorption. Despite its serious side effect, it has become such a promising<br>
antitumor agent that extensive research, considering both pharmokinetics and<br>
pharmacodynamic has led to the successful development of new closely related<br>
compounds. 10-Hydroxy- (20S) camptothecin (HCPT) was shown to possess<br>
therapeutic effect on liver carcinoma, leukemia, cancers associated with head and<br>
neck. 10-Hydroxy- (20S)-camptothecin was reported to show improved antitumor<br>
activity and was found to be ten times more potent against P-388 and 1210 mouse<br>
leukemia than the parent camptothecin and was found also to be less toxic. The<br>
hydrophobicity of CPT precluded its development as a clinical agent and necessitated<br>
the use of the hydrophilic synthetic congeners in various phases of clinical trails. 10-<br>
Hydroxycamptothecin has been isolated as a minor compound (0.002%) from the<br>
extract of stem wood of C.acuminata by Wall, M.E., &amp; Wani, M.C., (J. Org. Chem.<br>
34.1364 1969) and Ophirrhiza mungos Linn (Tafur. S., Nelson, J. D., Delong, D.C.<br>
and Svobodo, G.H., Lloydia 39 261 1976). Wani, M.C., (J. Med. Chem. 23(5) 554<br>
1980) reported the total synthesis of (dl)-9-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin with the ring E intact involving a number of step's. However,<br>
the method gives a low yield and therefore is only of academic value.<br>
Kingbury, W. D., (J. Med. Chem. 37 98 1991) converted CPT to HCPT by<br>
reduction-oxidation sequence using platinum catalyst to afford mixture of compounds<br>
including 10-acetoxycamptothecin and unreacted CPT. This method of preparation is<br>
not economically viable. Among HCPT congeners Camptosar (Irinotecan HC1 CPT-<br>
11 by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn) and Hycamtin (Topotecan HC1 TPT SmithKline<br>
Beecham Pharmaceutical) have been approved for the treatment of metastatic<br>
colorectal carcinoma and small cell lung cancer along with refractory ovarian cancer.<br>
New potent and water soluble derivatives have been synthesized and are now<br>
in clinical studies while other potent drugs are in pre-clinical stage as second<br>
generation camptothecin. Functionalization at 7,9,10, positions is compatible with<br>
increase in activity as shown by the 9-amino-20- (S)-camptothecin, Lurtotecan (G-<br>
1147211) (Takimoto, C.H., Wright, J. S., Arbuck, G., Chemother. Pharmacol. 42<br>
1400 1998) and Exetecan (Dx-8951) (Mitsui, I., Kumazawa, E., Hirota, Y., Aonuma,<br>
M., Sugumori, M., Ohsuki, S., Uoto, K., Ejima, A., Tersawa, H., Sato, K., Jpn. J<br>
Cancer Res. 88 760 1995).<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to present an improved process for<br>
the preparation of Topotecan-HCl from 10-Hydroxycamptothecin by aminoalkylation,<br>
using dihalomethane, viz. dichloromethane, dibromomethane, or diidomethane as a<br>
reagent, by unconventional Mannich reaction.<br>
Another object of the invention is to obtain better yield than by classical<br>
methods of inducting C-l unit using low boiling, low density and less toxic reagent,<br>
dichloromethane in place of formaldehyde.<br>
Another object of the invention is to carry out reaction under mild conditions<br>
at low pressure and at room temperature with high reactivity and to prevent at the<br>
same time polyalkylation, which is a problem for electron-rich phenolic substrate.<br>
Another object is to obtain Eschenmoser's salts (N-methyl-N-methylenmethaniminium<br>
salts) which follow the reaction pathway in which soluble and reactive<br>
"ion pair" formed after gegenion exchange from potassium ortho phenolate and<br>
Eschenmoser's salts which eventually collapses to give ortho-attacked products.<br>
Another object of the invention is to compare the behavior of protic/aprotic<br>
solvents for ortho-regiospecific monoalkylated products.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for preparing 9-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-hydroxycamptothecin (topotecan) from 10-hydroxy-4-(S)-camptothecin of the formula I below<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula 1<br>
dissolved in an organic solvent, such as herein described the process comprising ortho-regioselective aminomethylation of HCPT with dimethylamine, using a dihalomethane such as herein described, under solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis along with a solid base catalyst such as herein described in suspension form, and under stirring is done at a pressure in the range of 10-18 psi. for a period of 4-8 hours at temperature in the range of 25°C-45°C and on a rotary shaker at 220-250 rpm., filtering the solid product obtained and washing the obtained solid product, evaporating the solvent and purifying the residue to obtain topotecan. In one embodiment of the invention, the dihalomethane is selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane, dibromomethane and diidomethane.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the solvent medium is selected from the group consisting of methylene halides, toluene, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and any mixture thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the solid base catalyst is selected from the group consisting of potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, lithium carbonate and hydrated potassium carbonate.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the stirring is done at a pressure in the range of 10-18 psi. for a period of 4-8 hours.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 25°C-45°C and on a rotary shaker at 220-250 rpm.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the product topotecan obtained is in the form of a acetate or a hydrochloride salt by freeze drying<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the acetate of topotecan is converted to the pure hydrochloride salt thereof by adding dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid to the solution of acetate salt of topotecan followed by lyophilization.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, filtered residue is washed with ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
The obtained residue is preferably purified by repeated recrystallization or by<br>
distillation.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Purification of the product may be effected by conventional chromatography<br>
or by repeated crystallization and finally characterized by physico-chemical<br>
techniques.<br>
10-Hydroxycamptothecin up to 99% purity was stirred with anhydrous<br>
potassium carbonate along with dimethylamine and dihalomethane at room<br>
temperature 25 °C for 5 hours. The reaction was monitored by chromatographic<br>
techniques TLC, HPLC using different solvent systems at different wavelengths. The<br>
formation of the products was also determining by UV scanning. The substrate shows<br>
bathochromic shift when treated with dilute base. On TLC substrate (HCPT) shows<br>
orange colored spots, where as TLC chromatogram of the products shows yellow spot<br>
on UV (254nm) on UV visualization. It is observed that toluene is solvent of choice<br>
for electron-rich phenols since it decreases polyalkylation whereas dichloromethane<br>
usually gives higher reactivity for substrate bearing electron-withdrawing groups.<br>
The following examples are illustrative and not limiting of the scope of the<br>
invention. This description will clearly enable one skilled in the art to make and use<br>
the invention and describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives<br>
and uses of the invention including what we presently believe is the best mode of<br>
carrying out the invention.<br>
Example I<br>
A) 10-Hydroxycamptothecin was prepared by subjecting camptothecin (3.2g<br>
0.0092 mol), 0.8g of Pt° (prepared by pre-reduction of 8g of amorphous PtO2 in 80ml<br>
of HOAc for 1.5hr under 1 atmosphere hydrogen pressure) and acetic acid to 1 atm. of<br>
H2 for 8.5h after which theoretical amount of H: absorbed (slightly more than 0.4 1)<br>
and uptake of H2 gets slowed down The reaction mixture was degassed under steam<br>
of Helium and filtered through celite and washed with HOAc (20ml). The resulting<br>
solution of 1, 2, 6, 7 tetrahydroxy- camptothecin was treated immediately with Pb<br>
(OAc)4 (6.4g 0.014mol) in portions and reaction mixture stirred vigorously under<br>
Helium for 30 min. Gummy residue was obtained on evaporation of solvent which<br>
was triturated with cold water (100 ml) to produce light brown solid. The solid was<br>
collected, washed with cold water and air dried overnight when a mixture of 10-<br>
HCPT (44%), 10-AcHOCPT (26%) and unreacted CPT (32%) on HPLC basis was<br>
obtained. This crude mixture was combined with 150ml of 50% HOAc and heated<br>
under reflux conditions overnight. The reaction mixturewas cooled, concentrated to<br>
20ml and treated with cold water (100ml) to produce precipitate, which is filtered,<br>
washed with more cold water and dried to afford 2.1g of solid containing HCPT<br>
(70%) AcCPT (1.2%) and CPT (21.3%) on the basis HPLC. Mixture was triturating<br>
with 0.5% aq HC1 to dissolve the water-soluble. When insoluble CPT was removed<br>
by filtration. Water-soluble was extracted with chloroform and crystallized from<br>
boiling solution of 20% of MeOH in CHCI3 by adding EtOAC dropwise until<br>
turbidity appeared to obtain pure yellow HCPT which gives orange colored spot on<br>

3, CH3C02), 2.50 (s, 6, (CH3)2NH), 4.20 (s, 2, ArCH2N), 5.28 (d, 1, J=19 Hz, C-17),<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. Out of three solid bases used for solid-liquid transfer catalysis for orthoaminomethylation<br>
of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin, potassium carbonate appears to be<br>
best choice for making 9-(dimethylamino) methyl]-10-hydroxy- (20s)-<br>
camptothecin (Topotecan).<br>
2. Higher reactivity is obtained under mild conditions and polyalkylation is<br>
minimized with electron rich substrates as effect of solvent and base shows that<br>
yield of the product decreases dramatically in the absence of a base. Herein crude<br>
product can be isolated by simple filtration.<br>
3. Dihalomethane has double role to play when it can behave both as a solvent and a<br>
reactant for rapid reaction with dimethylamine to form Mannich adducts at<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
4. Mannich products of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin have been isolated in good yield<br>
with methylene halide as a C-l unit source, instead of formaldehyde.<br>
5. Methylene halide and secondary amine react rapidly at room temperature and<br>
atmospheric pressure in basic conditions to form aminals (methylene-bisamines)<br>
as intermediates. In return, to our best knowledge, none of Mannich products have<br>
been obtained at atmospheric pressure, even after extended reaction times.<br>
6. Solid -liquid transfer phase catalysis is straight forward route to desired products<br>
since use of Preformed-iminium salts (Mannich reagents) generally does not<br>
provide solution for aminoalkylation of indole, quinoline and isoquinoline<br>
alkaloids<br>
7. Effect of solvent and base on model reaction shows that yield of the products<br>
decreases dramatically in the absence of any base or in the presence of amine like<br>
tri-butylamine. It was also observed that it is not necessary to work in anhydrous<br>
conditions using potassium carbonate as a base.<br>
8. Methodology provides superior yields, faster reaction under milder conditions,<br>
less undesired products for preparation of complex molecules. Where<br>
conventional Mannich procedure relies on the generation of aminomethyl species<br>
through equilibria involving an amine and formaldehyde which are only suitable<br>
for aminomethylation of electron-rich aromatic species and has limited scope<br>
when extended to less reactive substrates which are inert to classical Mannich<br>
conditions.<br>
9. Though the yields while using dibromo and diodo methylenes were slightly<br>
higher, but keeping in view, the cost and the ease with which reagents are used<br>
dichloromethylene appears to be the best.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1	A process for preparing 9-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (topotecan) from 10-hydroxy-4-(S)-camptothecin of the formula 1 below<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
