				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A disc case<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a disc case capable of accommodating a disc-shaped signal recording medium, such as a magnetic disc or an optical disc.<br>
2.	Related art of the Invention<br>
A conventional disc case disclosed in Japanese Utility Model No. Hei 6-2132 is described below referring to FIG-31, a perspective view showing the conventional disc.  The main unit of a disc case 80 comprises an upper half 81 and a lower half 82 so as to form a disc accommodation chamber 87. The upper half 81 and the lower half 82 of the main unit of the disc case 80 are each provided with an opening 85 (see FIG. 32).  In addition, the main unit of the disc case 80 is provided with a shutter 83 being slidable in the direction indicated by arrow F or G. The shutter 83 covers the openings 85 formed in the disc case 80.  The openings 85 are formed (1) so that a chucking member (including a disc table) can externally pressure-contact a disc 86 accommodated inside and (2) so that an optical head can gain access to the signal recording surface of the disc 86. The<br><br>
openings 85 communicate with the accommodation chamber 87 accommodating the disc 86.<br>
In case the shutter 83 covers the openings 85 as shown in FIG. 31, a pair of engagement holes 84 provided in the shutter 83 engage a pair of elastic pawls 88 (see FIG. 32) provided on the main unit 80 so as to prevent the shutter 83 from sliding in direction F or G.<br>
The shutter 83 is opened to expose the opening 85 as described below.  In order to release the elastic pawl 88 engaging one of the engagement holes 84, an engagement release member (release pin) (not shown) is inserted into the engagement hole 84. While being kept inserted in the engagement hole 84, the engagement release member is slid toward the other engagement hole 84, thereby opening the shutter 83.<br>
The shutter 83 now being opened is closed as described below. The engagement release member remains inserted in the above-mentioned engagement hole 84.  When the engagement release member is moved to its original position, the shutter 83 covers the exposed openings 85.  After the shutter 83 covers the openings 85, the engagement release member is extracted from the engagement hole 84.  Instead of the engagement release member, the elastic pawl 88 engages the engagement hole 84 so as to restore the lock condition.<br>
The above-mentioned opening/closing operation of the<br><br>
shutter 83 is performed when the disc case 80 is inserted into or taken out of a signal recording and/or reproducing apparatus (player).<br>
Consequently, the shutter can be opened and closed positively.<br>
However, since the above-mentioned conventional disc case is not dustproof sufficiently, there is the danger of entry of dust into the accommodation chamber. More specifically, a concave portion 89 is formed in the range from the opening 85 to the front fringe portion of the case so as to decrease the amount of movement when the disc is dropped onto a disc table. Therefore, dust entered from the engagement holes 84 formed in the shutter 83 to the interior of the disc case 80 can further enter the accommodation chamber 87 via the concave portion 89.<br>
Accordingly, in consideration of the above mentioned problem, the object of the present invention is to provide a disc case capable of protecting the disc accommodation chamber thereof from dust.<br>
To solve the problem, the present invention provides a disc case comprising a main unit having an accommodation chamber capable of rotatably accommodating a disc, said main unit comprising (a) a head access opening formed in said main unit so that a head for at least one of reading and recording signals can access said disc; and (b) peripheral edge which is perpendicular to an axis of rotation of said disk, said head access opening situated between said peripheral edge and said axis of rotation; a shutter installed on said main unit so as to cover said head access opening when closed, and so as to expose said head<br><br>
access opening by sliding in either direction along said peripheral edge of said main unit; wherein a forefront fringe portion of said shutter protrudes past any portion of said peripheral edge of said main unit so that said forefront fringe portion receives pressure on either side thereof when said disc case is inserted into a case holder in one of a plurality of directions and said shutter is urged to expose said head access opening by sliding in said either direction.<br>

The shutter 14 covering the upper opening 22, the lower opening 28 and the like can be opened when the shutter opening/closing means pushes a right driven surface 41-R, namely one of the side surfaces defining the right driven hole 40-R, in the direction toward the left driven hole 40-L.  In the same way, the shutter 14 covering the upper opening 22, the lower opening 28 and the like can be opened when the shutter opening/closing means pushes a left driven surface 41-L (see FIG. 16A), namely one of the side surfaces defining the left driven hole 40-L, in the direction toward the right driven hole 40-R.<br>
Furthermore, the shutter 14 is equipped with a left engagement pawl portion 42-L and a right engagement pawl portion 42-R having engagement pawls inside and near both ends of the side wall portion 39 of the shutter 14.  The shutter 14 is connected to the main unit of the disc case 10 by virtue of the left engagement pawl portion 42-L and the right engagement pawl portion 42-R. The left engagement<br><br>

Referring to FIG. 12A, the left slide member 15-L is provided with a left spring hook portion 49-L for hooking the spring 16 shown in FIG. 2.  In addition, the left slide member 15-L is equipped with a left engagement pawl portion 50-L having an engagement pawl for engaging the main unit of the disc case 10, more specifically an engagement surface 48 (see FIG. 12B, and FIG.14, a sectional view taken on line A-A of FIG. 6) of the rail 44 provided near the lower front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13.  Furthermore, the left slide member 15-L is provided with a plate-like left engagement support portion 51-L for supporting the engagement at the left engagement pawl portion 50-L. Moreover, the left slide member 15-L is provided with a left locking pawl 58-L for engaging the left back surface 68-L of the left driven surface 41-L of the left driven hole 40-L formed in the shutter 14 (see FIG. 12C and FIG. 16A).<br>
In the same way as described above, a right slide member 15-R in accordance with the present embodiment is described below referring to FIG. 13A, a perspective view showing the right slide member 15-R, FIG. 13B, a sectional view taken on line C-C of FIG. 6, and FIG. 13C, a magnified view taken near the right slide member 15-R when the shutter 14 covers the upper opening 22, the lower opening 28 and the like.<br><br>
The right slide member 15-R is also provided with a right spring hook portion 49-R for hooking the spring 16. In addition, the right slide member 15-R is equipped with a right engagement pawl portion 50-R for engaging the rail 44 and a plate-like right engagement support portion 51-R for supporting the engagement at the right engagement pawl portion 50-R. Moreover, the right slide member 15-R is also provided with a right locking pawl 58-R for engaging the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the right driven hole 40-R formed in the shutter 14 (see FIGS. 16A and 16B). The other portions of the right slide member are similar to those of the left slide member.<br>
The slide members are provided with shielding portions to prevent dust from entering the accommodation chamber 18. Referring to FIG. 12Ar the left slide member 15-L is provided with a left driven hole blocking portion 59-L having the shape of a cylindrical side wall and constituting a portion for blocking the left driven hole 40-L of the shutter 14.  In the same way, as shown in FIG. 13C, the right slide member 15-R is provided with a right driven hole blocking portion 59-R having the shape of a cylindrical side wall and constituting a portion for blocking the right driven hole 40-R of the shutter 14.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 12C, the left slide member 15-L is provided with a left side wall surface 60-L to block<br><br>
a gap generated between the side surface of the shutter 14 near the left driven hole 40-L and a slit S (refer to S in FIG. 10) between the upper front fringe portion 24 and the lower front fringe portion 30. In the same way, the right slide member 15-R is provided with a right side wall surface 60-R to block a gap generated on the side surface of the shutter 14 near the right driven hole 40-R.<br>
The following describe the assembly of all the members of the disc case in accordance with the present embodiment and also describe the functions of the major members thereof.<br>
First, the following describe the incorporation of the slide members into the main unit of the disc case 10. Before installing the left slide member 15-L and the right slide member 15-R in the main unit of the disc case 10, one end of the spring 16 is hooked to the left spring hook portion 49-L of the left slide member 15-L, and the other end of the spring 16 is hooked to the right spring hook portion 49-R of the right slide member 15-R.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 12A and 12B, the left slide member 15-L is then incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10 as described below. First, the left engagement pawl portion 50-L of the left slide member 15-L is pushed from the upper surface 46 of the rail 44 to the accommodation chamber 18 along the left slide fitting portion 52-L formed<br><br>
on the rail 44 of the lower half 13 while being elastically deformed upward. At the same time, the left engagement support portion 51-L of the left slide member 15-L is inserted into a left groove 53-L defined by the lower surface 47 of the rail 44 and the inner surface (upper surface) of the lower half 13 (see FIG. 12B). At this time, a convex left stop portion 55-L on the left slide member 15-L is inserted into the left restriction groove 56-L formed in the rail 44 as shown in FIG. 12B.<br>
As a result, the left slide member 15-L is fit into the rail 44, and slidably incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10.  In the same way, the right slide member 15-R is incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10 along the right slide fitting portion 52-R (see FIGS. 6, 13A and 13B). However, these slide members have different slidable regions. Referring to FIG. 6, the left slide member 15-L slides along a part of the rail 44 provided on the left side of the lower bridge portion 35, and the right slide member 15-R slides along a part of the rail 44 provided on the right side of the lower bridge portion 35.<br>
Next, the shutter 14 is incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10 as described below. Referring to FIG. 6, the rail 44 in parallel with the lower front fringe portion 30 is formed near the lower front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13 as described above.  The left fitting<br><br>
portion 45-L and the right fitting portion 45-R are formed near both ends of the lower bridge portion 35. As shown in FIG. 11, the left fitting portion 45-L is used to fit the left engagement pawl portion 42-L of the shutter 14 into the rail 44, and the right fitting portion 45-R is used to fit the right engagement pawl portion 42-R into the rail 44. Referring to FIGS. 6, 7 and 11, in order to incorporate the shutter 14 into the main unit of the disc case 10, the left engagement pawl portion 42-L and the right engagement pawl portion 42-R of the shutter 14 are pushed from the upper surface 46 of the rail 44 to the accommodation chamber 18 along the left fitting portion 45-L and the right fitting portion 45-R while being elastically deformed upward. At the same time, the left engagement support portion 43-L and the right engagement support portion 43-R are pushed from the lower surface 47 of the rail 44 to the accommodation chamber 18 while being elastically deformed downward (see FIG. 6, and FIG. 14, a sectional view taken on line A-A of FIG. 6; the front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13 is not present under an area of the lower surface 47 of the rail 44 corresponding to a range provided with the left fitting portion 45-L and the right fitting portion 45-R). As a result, the shutter 14 is fit into the rail 44 and installed into the rail 44 formed on the lower half 13, thereby incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10.<br><br>
In this condition, the left engagement pawl 42-L and the right engagement pawl 42-R engage the engagement surface 48 of the rail 44 as shown in FIGS. 11 and 14.  In addition, the upper surface of the left engagement support portion 43-L and the upper surface of the right engagement support portion 43-R make contact with the lower surface 47 of the rail 44 so as to support the engagement of the left engagement pawl portion 42-L and the right engagement pawl portion 42-R. As a result, once the shutter 14 is incorporated into the main unit of the disc case 10, the shutter 14 does not slip off spontaneously.<br>
The function of the spring 16 is then described below. The left slide member 15-L and the right slide member 15-R installed in the lower half 13 as described above tend to come close to each other because of the shrinkage force of the spring 16 secured to the left spring hook portion 49-L and the right spring hook portion 49-R.  However, as shown in FIG. 12A, the convex left stop portion 55-L having a left slide stop surface 54-L is formed on the left slide member 15-L.  The convex left stop portion 55-L is inserted in the left restriction groove 56-L formed in the rail 44 shown in FIG. 12B.  The right end of the left restriction groove 56-L terminates at the left stop surface 57-L as shown in FIG. 6. Since the left slide stop surface 54-L of the left slide member 15-L is thus prevented from moving further by the<br><br>
left stop surface 57-L of the rail 44, the left slide member 15-L cannot slide further toward the right slide member 15-R.  In the same way, since the right slide stop surface 54-R of the right slide member 15-R is prevented from moving further by the right stop surface 57-R of the rail 44, the right slide member 15-R cannot slide further toward the left slide member 15-L. For this reason, the left slide member 15-L and the right slide member 15-R are positioned at both ends of the lower bridge portion 35 if no external force is applied.<br>
In this condition, the left stop surface 57-L and the right stop surface 57-R in accordance with the present embodiment are used as stoppers for the disc case of the present invention.<br>
The following describe a mechanism for locking the shutter 14 by using the slide members. Referring to FIGS. 11, 12A and 12C, the left slide member 15-L is provided with the left locking pawl 58-L for engaging the left back surface 68-L of the left driven surface 41-L of the left driven hole 40-L formed in the shutter 14 (also see FIG. 16A).  In the same way, the right slide member 15-R is provided with a right locking pawl 58-R for engaging the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the right driven hole 40-R formed in the shutter 14 (see FIGS. 13A, 13C and 16A).<br><br>
As described above, the left slide member 15-L and the right slide member 15-R are first fit into the rail 44, and positioned at both ends of the lower bridge portion 35 by the action of the spring 16.  In this condition, the shutter 14 is fit into the rail 44 as described above. As a result, the left locking pawl 58-L of the left slide member 15-L engages the left back surface 68~L of the left driven surface 41-L of the shutter 14, and the right locking pawl 58-R of the right slide member 15-R engages the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the shutter 14.  In this way, the shutter 14 is locked and cannot slide. The left stop surface 57-L, the right stop surface 57-R, the left fitting portion 45-L, the right fitting portion 45-R, the left locking pawl 58-L, the right locking pawl 58-R, etc. are configured in terms of position and size so that the left locking pawl 58-L and the right locking pawl 58-R accurately engage the left back surface 68-L of the left driven surface 41-L and the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R, respectively, when the shutter 14 is fit into the rail 44 as described above.<br>
Next, the opening/closing operation of the shutter 14 of the disc case 10 in accordance with the present embodiment is described below referring to FIGS. 15A and 16A, views showing a condition wherein the shutter 14 is closed; and FIGS. 15B and 16B, views showing a condition wherein the<br><br>
shutter 14 is open. Referring to FIGS. 15A and 16A, when the shutter 14 covers the upper opening 22 and the like of the disc case 10, since the left locking pawl 58-L of the left slide member 15-L engages the left back surface 68-L of the left driven surface 41-L of the shutter 14 as described above, the shutter 14 cannot move in the direction indicated by arrow L.  In the same way, since the right locking pawl 58-R of the right slide member 15-R engages the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the shutter 14, the shutter 14 cannot move in the direction indicated by arrow R, either.<br>
When the disc case 10 is loaded into a signal recording and/or reproducing apparatus (not shown), a pin 62 installed at the tip of shutter opening/closing means 61 provided in the apparatus is inserted into the right driven hole 40-R, while the pin 62 is in parallel with the surface of the disc 11 and the tip of the pin 62 contacts a lower surface 63, namely one of the surfaces of the right driven hole 40-R (see FIG. 11).  Furthermore, the tip of the pin 62 inserted into the right driven hole 40-R pushes the right driven hole blocking portion 59-R of the right slide member 15-R toward the accommodation chamber 18. This pushing force releases the engagement at the right locking pawl 58-R of the right slide member 15-R from the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the right driven hole 40-R.  As<br><br>
a result, the shutter 14 can move only in the direction indicated by arrow L (see FIG. 16B).<br>
The disc case 10 is then loaded further into the above-mentioned apparatus. Therefore, the pin 62 of the shutter opening/closing means 61 further pushes the right driven hole blocking portion 59-R toward the accommodation chamber 18, while the engagement release condition is maintained. However, the pin 62 cannot further push and move the right driven hole blocking portion 59-R because of the restriction at the right driven hole 40-R of the shutter 14. Therefore, the pin 62 is rotated in the direction indicated by arrow C, thereby opening the shutter 14. Eventually, the shutter 14 is opened in the direction indicated by arrow L (see FIG. 15B).  In the same way, the shutter 14 can also be opened in the direction indicated by arrow R, when the shutter opening/closing means 61 is disposed upside down and when the pin 62 thereof is inserted into the left driven hole 40-L.<br>
The condition shown in FIG. 15B is described below in more detail. Although the right slide member 15-R is pulled by the spring 16 in the direction indicated by arrow L, since the right slide stop surface 54-R (see FIG. 13A) of the right slide member 15-R interferes with the right stop surface 57-R (see FIG. 6) of the rail 44, the right slide member 15-R cannot move further in the direction indicated<br><br>
by arrow L. On the other hand, the right side surfaces 500L (see FIG. 12A) of the left engagement pawl portion 50-L and the left engagement support portion 51-L of the left slide member 15-L push the left surfaces (see FIG. 11) of the left engagement pawl portion 42-L and the left engagement support portion 43-L of the shutter 14 in the direction indicated by arrow R by the force of the spring 16. While the force of the spring 16 is applied as described above, the shutter opening/closing means 61 operated to open the shutter 14 keeps pushing the right driven surface 41-R of the right driven hole 40-R by using the pin 62, thereby retaining the open condition of the shutter 14.<br>
The following describe how the disc case 10 being in the above-mentioned condition is taken out of the apparatus (player). Referring to FIG. 15B, a force is applied to the shutter opening/closing means 61 in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrow C (see FIG. 15A) by a spring, a motor or the like. As the disc case 10 is taken out of the apparatus, the shutter opening/closing means 61 is rotated in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrow C by the force applied in the opposite direction.  However, the force in the direction indicated by arrow R has been applied to the shutter 14 by the spring 16 as described above. Therefore, the shutter 14 is moved in the direction indicated by arrow R, while following the<br><br>
movement of the shutter opening/closing means 61 which is rotated in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrow C, thereby covering the upper opening 22 and the like. When the shutter 14 has returned to the condition shown in FIG. 15A, the left locking pawl 58-L of the left slide member 15-L engages the left back surface 68-L of the left driven surface 41-L of the shutter 14, and the right locking pawl 58-R of the right slide member 15-R engages the right back surface 68-R of the right driven surface 41-R of the shutter 14, thereby locking the shutter 14 (see FIGS. 11, 12 and 16).<br>
Next, the dustproof effect at the disc case 10 in accordance with the present embodiment is described below referring to FIG. 17A, a perspective view showing the shutter 14 positioned to cover the upper opening 22 and the like of the disc case 10, FIG. 17B, a sectional view taken on line D-D of FIG. 17A, and FIG. 17C, a sectional view taken on line E-E of FIG. 17A.<br>
The problem encountered in the conventional disc case is further clarified as described below referring to FIGS. 17A, 17B and 8.<br>
The conventional disc case is not provided with the right slide member 15-R shown in FIG. 17A.  Therefore, dust can enter the interior of the shutter 14 through the right driven hole 40-R of the shutter 14.  In addition, dust can<br><br>
enter the interior of the shutter 14 through an opening 400-R (see FIG. 11) provided at the right end portion of the shutter 14 near the right driven hole 40-R.  Furthermore, dust can enter the interior of the shutter 14 through the slit S (see FIG. 10) defined by the front fringe portion 24 of the upper half 12 and the front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13.  Dust having entered the interior of the shutter 14 from the above-mentioned openings and slit can further enter the accommodation chamber 18 through the upper concave portion 23 of the bridge portion 33 or the lower concave portion 29 of the bridge portion 35 in the direction indicated by arrow F or G shown in FIG. 17B (see FIG. 8). Moreover, dust can enter the accommodation chamber 18 through the left side of the shutter 14 in the same way.<br>
In the case of the disc case 10 in accordance with the present embodiment/ however, the right driven hole 40-R is blocked with the right driven hole blocking portion 59-R of the right slide member 15-R as shown in FIG. 17A. Additionally, the opening 400-R provided at the right end portion of the shutter 14 near the right driven hole 40-R is blocked by the right side wall surface 60-R of the right slide member 15-R (see FIG. 13C). Besides, the slit S (see FIG. 10) defined by the front fringe portion 24 of the upper half 12 and the front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13 is also blocked by the right side wall surface 60-R of the<br><br>
right slide member 15-R. Therefore, dust cannot enter the interior of the shutter 14.<br>
In the same way, the left driven hole 40-L is blocked with the left driven hole blocking portion 59-L of the left slide member 15-L. Additionally, the opening 400-L (see FIG. 12C) provided at the left end portion of the shutter 14 near the left driven hole 40-L is blocked with the left side wall surface 60-L of the left slide member 15-L. Besides, the slit S (see FIG. 12C) defined by the front fringe portion 24 of the upper half 12 and the front fringe portion 30 of the lower half 13 is also blocked by the left side wall surface 60-L of the left slide member 15-L. Therefore, dust cannot enter the interior of the shutter 14 in the case of the case in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Next, dust entry from the shutter 14 positioned at the central portion of the disc case is also prevented as described below. Referring to FIG. 17C, a holding flange 600 is provided to hold down the upper end portion 64 and the lower end portion 65 of the shutter 14. The holding flange 600 is made by providing an upper cutout 66 in the upper half 12 and by providing an lower cutout 67 in the lower half 13. Accordingly, dust may enter from the upper cutout 66 and the lower cutout 67.  However, when the shutter 14 covers the upper opening 22 and the like of the disc case 10, the upper end portion 64 of the shutter 14<br><br>
enters the upper cutout 66 so as to block the upper cutout 66.  In the same way, when the shutter 14 covers the lower opening 28 and the like of the disc case 10, the lower cutout 67 is blocked with the lower end portion 65 of the shutter 14.<br>
Consequently, when the shutter 14 covers the upper opening 22, the lower opening 28 and the like of the disc case 10, the accommodation chamber 18 is completely blocked.<br>
Although the left locking pawl 58-L and the right locking pawl 58-R are provided to lock the shutter 14 in the above-mentioned embodiment, it is not always necessary to provide a mechanism for locking the shutter 14.  In case such a mechanism is unnecessary, the left driven hole blocking portion 59-L of the left slide member 15-L and the right driven hole blocking portion 59-R of the right slide member 15-R are also unnecessary.  Furthermore, the left and right driven holes 40-L and 40-R of the shutter 14 are also unnecessary.<br>
Still another embodiment is shown in FIG. 18.  In other words, referring to FIG. 18, by providing the left driven hole 40-L and the right driven hole 4D-R at the center in the thickness direction of the shutter 14, the step difference between the end surfaces H and I can be decreased or eliminated.<br><br>
New embodiments (hereinafter referred to as other embodiments) are described below. The new embodiments are characterized in that the shutter 14 thereof is not locked and that when a disc case in accordance with the embodiments is set into a player, the disc case can be inserted into a holder both in the back-and-forth direction and the lateral direction.<br>
FIG. 19 is a perspective view showing a disc case in accordance with a first embodiment of the other embodiments. FIG. 20 is a perspective view showing the disc case shown in FIG. 19 with the shutter open.  FIG. 21 is a plan view showing the disc case shown in FIG. 19. As a rule, members similar to those used in the above-mentioned embodiment are represented by the same numerals, and not explained in detail. The first embodiment differs from the above-mentioned embodiment in that the shutter 140, the slide members 150-R and 150-L of the first embodiment are not provided with any locking mechanism as described above and that the front fringe portion of the shutter 140 projects.<br>
(1)	Since the disc case in accordance with the present embodiment has no locking mechanism, the shutter l40 being closed will open when an object hits the shutter 140. However, the structure of the disc case is made simple.<br>
(2)	The following mainly describe the feature wherein the disc case can be inserted into a holder both in the back-<br><br>
and-forth direction and in the lateral direction, (a) As obviously shown in FIG. 20, in the first embodiment, a protrusion portion 141 is formed at the central portion of the front fringe portion of the shutter 140, and steps 142-R and 142-L are formed at both corner portions of the projection portion 141. As shown in FIG. 21, the forefront fringe portion 1410 of the protrusion portion 141 is located at the position indicated by chain line B with respect to the forward direction (the shutter 140 slides along the front fringe portion of the main unit of the case). The forefront fringe portions 120-Rl and 120-Ll of the right fringe portion 120-R and the left fringe portion 120-L of the upper half 12 of the main unit of the case are located at the position indicated by chain line C. Furthermore, the surfaces 142-Rl and 142-Ll (see PIG. 20) of the steps 142-R and 142-L of the shutter 140, being in parallel with the above-mentioned slide direction, are located at the position indicated by chain line A. As shown in PIG. 21, chain line B is located at the most forward position, chain line A is located at the most backward position, and chain line C is located therebetween. The forefront fringe portions 130-Rl and 130-Ll of the right fringe portion 130-R and the left fringe portion 130-L of the lower half 13 are also located in the same way. At least the forefront fringe portion 1410 (the<br><br>
forefront fringe portion of the protrusion portion 141) of the shutter 140 is required to be protruded more forward than the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl, 120-Ll, 130-Rl and 130-Ll of the main unit (12, 13) of the case.  The parallel surface 142-Rl of the step 142-R of the shutter 140 is located behind the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl, 120-Ll, 130-Rl and 130-Ll because of the following reason.  In case the parallel surface is located behind the forefront fringe portions, the tip 1140 of a shutter opener described below interferes with the front portion of the step 142-R and cannot push a surface 142-R2 which is orthogonal to the slide direction. The above-mentioned configuration is thus used to prevent this problem.<br>
Next, the following describe the method of setting the disc case into the case holder in the back-and-forth direction.<br>
FIG. 22 is a perspective view showing a case holder, and FIG. 23 is a perspective view showing a condition wherein the insertion direction of the disc case 10 into a holder<br>
101	is orthogonal to the sliding direction of the shutter 140. The holder 101 is provided with L-shaped case guides<br>
102	at the left and right ends thereof.  Each of the case guides 102 is provided with a case stopper 103 at the forefront portion thereof to prevent the case 10 from advancing further. Outside the stopper 103, a shutter<br><br>
opener 610 is installed. The tip of the rotatable arm 612 of the shutter opener 610 is provided with a cylindrical pin 611.  In addition, the arm 612 is spring-loaded at all times toward the insertion side of the disc case 10 by a torsion spring 613.  The arm 612 is provided with a bent projection portion 614 as shown in FIG. 23. This projection portion 614 makes contact with the front fringe portion of the holder 101 so as to prevent the arm 612 from rotating further toward the insertion side. The position of the pin 611 determined by the projection portion 614 and the spring 613 corresponds to the position of the step 142-R of the shutter 140 of the case 10 to be inserted.  As a result, when the case 10 is inserted into the holder 101, the pin<br>
611	smoothly makes contact with the step 142-R.<br>
FIG. 23 is a view showing a condition wherein the disc case 10 is inserted into the holder lOl in the direction indicated by arrow A. As shown in FIG. 23, the pin 611 of the shutter opener 610 makes contact with the surfaces 142-Rl and 142-R2 of the step 142-R of the shutter 140, the arm<br>
612	is rotated, and the shutter 140 is opened in the<br>
direction indicated by arrow B by the rotation force of the<br>
arm 612.<br>
FIGS. 24 and 25 show a configuration wherein the insertion direction of the disc case 10 into the holder 101 is in parallel with the sliding direction of the shutter<br><br>
140.  The holder 111 shown in FIG. 24 is provided with a front case guide 112-F on the front side (the lower left region in FIG. 24) of the holder 111, and is also provided with a back case guide 112-B on the back side (the upper right region in FIG. 24) of the holder 111.  The guides 112-F and 112-B are L-shaped, and their end portions are provided with case stoppers 113-F and 113-B so as to prevent the case 10 from being inserted further.  In addition, the front case guide 112-F is provided with a gap 114 at a midpoint thereof to form a step. The portion 112-Fl, one of the two portions of the front case guide 112-F and being close to the case insertion position, is shifted forward from the other portion 112-F2 so as not to collide with the protrusion portion 141 of the shutter 140 to be inserted. On the other hand, the end portion 1140 (the end portion facing the gap 114) of the other portion 112-F2 makes contact with the step 142-R of the protrusion portion 141. As shown in FIG. 25, the case 10 is inserted sideways into the holder 111 in the direction from upper left to lower right in the figure (see arrow A).  In other words, the case 10 is inserted while the front fringe portion of the case 10 is directed lower left in the figure. Therefore, the protrusion portion 141 of the shutter 140 of the case 10 is moved along the lower left case guide 112-F of the holder 111.  As the protrusion portion 141 is guided<br><br>
by the guide portion 112-Fl during the insertion, the surface 142-R2 of the step 142-R of the protrusion portion 141 makes contact with the end portion 1140 of the other guide portion 112-F2. Consequently, as the case 10 is inserted further, the shutter 140 is opened in the direction indicated by arrow B because of the existence of the end portion 1140 of the other guide portion 112-F2.<br>
In this way, the disc case in accordance with the first embodiment can be inserted into the player both in the back-and-forth direction and in the lateral direction, and can be used in the player.<br>
The shutter 140 can be formed into a simple rectangular shape by eliminating the protrusion portion 141, the steps 142-R and 142-L.  In this case, the shutter opener 610 and the end portion 1140 make contact with the corner portion of the front fringe portion of the shutter 140 (refer to the following description of a second embodiment.)<br>
(b) A second embodiment of the other embodiments is described below referring to FIGS. 26 to 30.  FIG. 26 is a perspective view showing a disc case 10 in accordance with the present embodiment; FIG. 27 is a perspective view showing a condition wherein the shutter 145 of the disc case 10 is open; FIG. 28 is a plan view showing the disc case 10 shown in FIG. 27; FIG. 29 is a perspective view showing a case holder; and FIG. 30 is a perspective view showing a<br><br>
condition wherein the disc case 10 in accordance with the present embodiment is set in the holder shown in FIG. 29. As obviously shown in FIGS. 26 and 28, in the present embodiment, the front position of the forefront fringe portion 1451 of the shutter 145 is the same as the positions of the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl and 120-Ll of the right fringe portion 120-R and the left fringe portion 120-L of the upper half 12 of the main unit of the disc case 10, and is also the same as the positions of the forefront fringe portions 130-Rl and 130-Ll of the right fringe portion 130-R and the left fringe portion 130-L of the lower half 13.  In addition, as shown in FIG. 26, the front fringe portions 24 and 30 of the upper half 12 and the lower half 13 are behind the forefront fringe portion 1451, the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl, 120-Ll, 130-Rl and 130-Ll. Furthermore, a gap 123-R is formed between the forefront fringe portion 120-Rl of the right fringe portion 120-R of the upper half 12 and the forefront fringe portion 130-Rl of the right fringe portion 130-R of the lower half 13. Moreover, a gap 123-L is formed between the forefront fringe portion 120-Ll of the left fringe portion 120-L of the upper half 12 and the forefront fringe portion 130-Ll of the left fringe portion 130-L of the lower half 13.<br>
The following describe a method of inserting and setting the above-mentioned disc case 10 into a case holder 115<br><br>
shown in FIG. 29 in the lateral direction. A front case guide 116-F is provided on the front side (the lower left region in the figure) of the case holder 115, and a back case guide 116-B is provided on the back side (the upper right region in the figure) of the case holder 115.  These guides 116-F and 116-B are L-shaped, and their end portions are provided with case stoppers 117-F and 117-B to prevent the case 10 from being inserted further. Additionally, a cutout 119 is formed at the central portion of the front case guide 116-F, and a projection 118 is formed inward in the cutout 119.<br>
The case 10 is inserted into the case holder 115 having the above-mentioned structure as shown in FIG. 30. More specifically, the case 10 is inserted sideways into the holder 115 in the direction from upper left to lower right in the figure (see arrow A).  In other words, the case 10 is inserted while the front fringe portion of the case 10 is directed lower left. Therefore, the corner portion 145-R at the front fringe portion of the shutter 145 of the case 10 is moved along the lower left case guide 116-F of the holder 115.  As the corner portion 145-R is guided by the guide 116-F during the insertion, the corner portion 145-R makes contact with the projection 118 of the guide 116-F. Consequently, as the case 10 is inserted further, the shutter 145 is opened in the direction indicated by arrow B<br><br>
because of the existence of the projection 118 of the guide. Even when the case 10 is inserted upside down, the case 10 can be inserted in the same way as described above.<br>
The following describe a method of inserting and setting the above-mentioned disc case 10 into a case holder in the back-and-forth direction.  In this case, the disc case 10 is inserted into the case holder 101 shown in FIG. 22. As the disc case 10 is inserted in this case, the pin 611 of the shutter opener 610 makes contact with the corner portion 145-R of the shutter 145, and opens the shutter 145 while keeping contact with the corner portion 145-R.<br>
In this way, the disc case in accordance with the second embodiment can be inserted into and used in the player both in the back-and-forth direction and in the lateral direction. Unlike the first embodiment, the second embodiment can have the case guides 116-F and 116-B along the full length of the holder.  Therefore, the second embodiment is advantageous in that the disc case can be inserted stably.<br>
The following describe a case wherein the front position of the forefront fringe portion 1451 of the shutter 145 is behind the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl and 120-Ll of the right fringe portion 120-R and the left fringe portion 120-L of the upper half 12 of the main unit of the case. In case the front position of the forefront fringe<br><br>
portion 1451 of the shutter 145 is behind the forefront fringe portions 120-Rl and 120-Ll of the right fringe portion 120-R and the left fringe portion 120-L of the upper half 12 of the main unit of the case unit, and is also behind the forefront fringe portions 130-Rl and 130-Ll of the right fringe portion 130-R and the left fringe portion 130-L of the lower half 13 of the main unit of the case, the disc case can also be set into the player both in the lateral direction and in the back-and-forth direction by making the depths of the gaps 123-R and 123-L larger than those of the above-mentioned embodiment.<br>
In the present invention, the connection between the upper half 12 and the lower half 13 can be accomplished by welding or screw tightening. Alternatively, engagement pawls provided on the upper half 12 can be engaged with engagement holes provided in the lower half 13. Conversely, engagement holes provided in the upper half 12 can be engaged with engagement pawls provided on the lower half 13.<br>
Furthermore, although it is assumed that the disc 11 is an optical disc, it can be assumed that the disc 11 is a magnetic disc. Moreover, although it is assumed that both surfaces of the disc 11 are used as signal recording surfaces on which signals can be read and written, only one surface can be used as a signal recording surface.  What is<br><br>
more, the disc 11 can be a disc having surfaces on which no signal can be written. After all, the disc in accordance with the present invention should have at least one signal recording surface on which signals can be read and/or written.<br>
In case the disc 11 has one signal recording surface, one of the two slide members can be secured.<br>
Additionally, in the above-mentioned embodiments, although it is assumed that the head access opening communicates with the chucking member access openings, these openings can be provided independently.<br>
Besides, in the above-mentioned embodiments, although the upper concave portion 23 and the lower concave portion 29 are provided to decrease the movement amount of the disc 11 when the disc 11 is dropped onto the disc table, the concave portions of the present invention are not limited to those used for decreasing the amount of drop, but can be provided for other purposes as a matter of course.  In short, when there is a passage from a portion not covered with the shutter to the accommodation chamber, a shielding portion should only be provided to prevent dust from passing through the passage.<br>
Further, it is assumed that the concave portions in accordance with the present invention designate the upper concave portion 23 and the lower concave portion 29 in the<br><br>
descriptions of the above-mentioned embodiments, the concave portions are not limited to such concave portions, but can also designate a space ranging from the upper concave portion 23 to a cutout on the side of the upper front fringe portion 24 and a space ranging from the lower concave portion 29 to a cutout on the side of the lower front fringe portion 30.  Still more, when the bridge portion is not used to directly form the side wall surface of the accommodation chamber, but is provided closer to the front fringe portion of the case and when a space is present therebetween just as in the case of the above-mentioned embodiment, the space can also be referred to as the concave portion of the present invention.  In other words, holes can also be regarded as the concave portions of the present invention.<br>
More and more, in the present invention, a condition wherein the shutter covers the concave portions does not mean that the concave portions are hermetically sealed, but may mean that there are still gaps which are not covered.<br>
As obviously understood from the above-mentioned descriptions, the disc case of the present invention is simple in structure and can be assembled easily.  In case the shutter covers part of the concave portions, the support member access openings and the head access opening, the shutter can have an effect of completely blocking the accomraodaition chamber.<br><br><br>
