				<td>STABLE INITIATOR SYSTEM<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the use of photoiniators. More particularly, it relates to the stabilization of photo initiators useful in processes for making ophthalmic lenses.<br>
Ophthalmic lenses such as contact lenses are often made in processes that employ photoinitiated polymerization reactions. UV and visible radiation are most frequently used to initiate cure in these reactions. It is often desirable to prepare a mixture of materials together with an initiator or initiator system (where initiation involves more than one component) and other additives that will ultimately form the lens upon completion of the reactions. These types of mixtures are referred to as the "monomer mix" in this context. Stability of the initiator can be a crucial factor in the working time and shelf life of the monomer mix. Increasing the working time of the monomer mix is desirable since it reduces the need for preparation of starting materials and the possibility of introducing lot to lot and intra-lot variations in lens production.<br>
Acylphosphines are an interesting and useful class of initiators for free radical polymerizations of the type frequently used to made ophthalmic lenses. Reaction mechanisms for many of these materials are described in Reaction Mechanism of Monoacyl- and Bisacylphoine Oxide Photoinitiators Studied by 3IP, l3C-. and 1H-CIDNP and ESR, Urszula Kolczak, Gunther Rist, Kurt Dietliker, and Jacob Wirz, 118 J. Am. Chem. Soc., 6477 (1996). Bisacylphosphines and their use are further described in US Patent 5,534,559 and JP-A-8-259642 incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Unfortunately, this class of compounds tends to be unstable in a variety of environments lessening its potential as an active initiator. EP 849,296 proposes a method of stabilizing bisacylphosphine initiators used in the production of urethane (meth)acrylate polymers used for coatings. The method involves combining the monomer components together with the initiator in the presence of a tertiary amine and in the absence of a tin component. Japanese patents JP-A-4-6125; JP-A-<br><br>
296315; JP-A8-127630 propose similar methods of stabilizing monoacylphospine photoinitiators in the presence of a tin compound used as a polymerization catalyst.<br>
Unfortunately, these solutions are not desirable when applied to monomer mixes used to make ophthalmic lenses because of the potentially deleterious effect they may have on various components of the monomer mix. This is particularly true where the monomer mix is used to make silicone hydrogel lenses.<br>
A new method for stabilizing acylphosphine initiators is desirable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is a stable monomer mix for malting ophthalmic lenses. The stable monomer mix is made by admixing a monomer mixture, an initiator, and an , acid.<br>
In another aspect of the invention a silicone hydrogel monomer formulation is made by admixing a silicone hydrogel forming mixture, an initiator, and an acid.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of stabilizing an initiator system comprises lowering the pH of the initiator system.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a process for stabilizing a silicone hydrogel monomer formulation in an admixture of a reactive silicone macromer and a photoiniator comprises admixing an acid with the admixture of macromer and photoinitiator.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Structure I<br>
2<br>
The initiators of this invention are those having the following structure:<br><br><br>
wherein, R1, R2, and R3 are each independently H or a C1-2 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aromatic moiety provided that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 has the following structure:<br><br>
Structure II<br>
and is attached to the P at the acyl carbon, and wherein, R4-R8 are independently, H or a C1-3 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkoxy moiety.<br>
In each case, where an R1-R8 group is substituted, the substituent can comprise a hydroxy or C1-4 alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, or alkynyl group. Substitution with hetero atoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and halo atoms is possible but is not favored.<br>
It is preferred that R1 and R2 are both Structure II moieties with R4 and R8 substituents. It is most preferred that R4 and R8 are methoxy groups. It is further preferred in this embodiment that R3 is a C1-10 alkyl, alkoxy, or alkenyl group substituted with C1-2 alkyl groups; most preferably a substituted pentyl group.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment, R1 and R2 are both Structure II moieties with R4 and R8 being methoxy groups; R1 is a trimethyl pentyl group. Thus, the most preferred embodiment has the following structure:<br>

Mixtures that include a UV and visible light initiator system are preferred as they permit more flexible use of UV blockers in the monomer mix.<br>

It is generally desirable that acids used in the practice of this invention are of such molarity or concentration that they imbue the monomer mix in which they are to be used with a pH of 3 to 8. Preferably, it is less man 7. While the upper end of the pH scale to which the monomer mix could be lowered is slightly alkaline, the addition of acid lowers the pH to point that it would not otherwise reside. In any event, in the case of a monoprotic acid such as HCL, about 0.1 to about 10 weight % of acid is used in the monomer mix . Based on this, the skilled artisan can readily determine equivalent ranges for other acids useful in the practice of this invention.<br>
Making the lenses of this invention is conducted by combining the components of the monomer mix together with the initiators and stabilizers described above according to well known methods of lens formation such as photoinitiated casting in lens molds.<br>
Silicone hydrogels have high oxygen permeability making them particularly desirable for use in the lenses of this invention. When the monomer mix<br>
8<br><br>
comprises components for the preparation of silicone hydrogels, it is referred to herein as a silicone hydrogel forming mixture. Silicone hydrogels are preferably prepared by polymerizing a mixture containing at least one silicone-contain ing monomer and at least one hydrophilic monomer. Either the silicone-containing monomer or the hydrophilic monomer may function as a crosslinking agent or a separate crosslinker may be employed. Crosslinking agents are monomers having multiple polymerizable moieties. The term "monomer" when used in this sense refers to a material used in forming the ultimate polymer system. The crosslinking agent can be monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, or polymeric molecules and still be considered a monomer with respect to the silicone hydrogel ultimately produced from it. The polymerizable functionalities generally bond to more than one polymer chain creating a network or network-like polymeric structure. There are numerous silicone-containing monomeric units commonly used in the formation of silicone hydrogels. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,136,250; 4,153,641; 4,740,533; 5,034,461; 5,070,215; 5,260,000; 5,310,779; and 5,358,995 provide some useful examples and each is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Hydrophilic monomers that have previously been found useful for making silicone hydrogels include: unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as methacrylic and acrylic acids; acrylic substituted alcohols, such as 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and 2-hydroxyethylacrylate; vinyl lactams, such as N-vinyl pyTrolidone; and acrylamides, such as methacrylamide and N,N-dimethylacrylamide. Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,070,215, and the hydrophilic oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,277 and each is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The preferred components of the monomer mix used to make the silicone hydrogel lenses of this invention include, for example, siloxanes and aerylic/methacrylie acid and derivatives, polyvinyl, typically di- or tri-vinyl monomers, such as di- or tri(meth)acrylates of diethyleneglycol, triethyleneglycol, butyleneglycol and hexane-1,6- diol; divinylbenzene. In the preferred embodiment, the siloxane component is a polydimethyl siloxane. It is combined with a hydrophilic monomer such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate or acrylate derivative. In the most preferred embodiment, the monomers comprise mono-alkyl terminated<br>
9<br><br>
polydimethylsiloxanes ("mPDMS") such as monomethacryloxy propyl terminated polydimethyl siloxane and a macromer comprising the reaction product of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate,<br>
methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane, mono-methacryloxypropyl terminated mono-butyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane, and 3-isopropenyl- , -dimethylbenzyl isocyanate. Additionally preferred monomers include, for example, methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethyl siloxy) silane, "TRIS"; N,N-dimethyl acrylamide, "DMA"; triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, "TEGDMA". Other monomers and crosslinking agents Known in the art for making silicone hydrogels can also be used. The employment of mPDMS is noteworthy as it is thought to be responsible for imbuing the resulting hydrogel with improved mechanical properties such as reduced elastic modulus and tan 8 (loss modulus of the material divided by its elastic modulus or G"/G') without compromising monomer compatibility during the polymerization process. Unlike many of the siloxanes predominantly used at present, mPDMS has no polar functionality and is of relatively high molecular weight. Measures to improve its incorporation are thus welcome. The structure of mPDMS can be described as follows:<br><br>
where b = 0 to 100, and R57 is any C1-10 aliphatic or aromatic group which may include hetero atoms; provided that R57 is not functionalized at the point at which it is bonded to Si. C3-8 alkyl groups are preferred with butyl groups, particularly sec-butyl groups, being most preferred. R56 is any single polymerizable vinyl group. Preferably it is a methacryl moiety but it can also be an acryl or styrenic moiety or other similar moiety.<br>
10<br><br>
The monomer mix also includes the initiators and acids described above. These can be added to the mix before, during, or after the mix is combined in a lens mold or other vessel for lens formation.<br>
It is also desirable to carry out the cure in the presence of a diluent. Suituable diluents include alkanols, N,N- dimethylformamide acetamide, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylacetamide, heptane, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, tert-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Low molecular weight (C5-12) alkanols are preferred. Dimethyl-3-octanol is most preferred.<br>
The invention is further described in the following nonlimiting examples.<br>

to 30°C. The toluene was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield off-white, anhydrous, waxy, reactive macromer. The theoretical OH content of the macromer is 1.69 mmol/g.<br>
Example 2 (Lens Formation)<br>
A hydrogel was made from the following monomer mix (all amounts are calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the combination): macromer of example 1 (~18%); an Si7-9 monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane (~28%); methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethyl siloxy) silane, "TRIS" (-14%); dimethyl amide, "DMA" (-26%); hydroxy ethyl methacrylic acid, "HEMA" (-5%); triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, "TEGDMA" (~1%), polyvinylpyrrolidone, "PVP" (~5%); CGI 1850 (a 1:1 (wgt) blend of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxyben2oyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide) photoinitiator (~1%), glacial acetic acid (~5%) , with the balance comprising minor amounts of additives. The polymerization was conducted in the presence of 20%wt dimethyl-3-octanol diluent.<br>
The hydrogels were formed by adding about 0.10 g of the monomer mix to the cavity of an eight cavity lens mold of the type described in U.S. Patent 4,640,489 and curing for 1200 sec. Polymerization occurred under a nitrogen purge and was photoinitiated with 5 mW cm'2 of UV light generated with an Andover Corp. 420PS10-25 AM39565-02 light filter.<br>
Lenses were successfully made from this monomer mix over the course of 5 days without reconsistitution of the macromer or other components of the monomer mix.<br>
This example illustrates the lengthy working time that can be attained by stabilizing the initiator according to this invention.<br>
12<br><br>
Example 3 (Comparative- No Acid)<br>
Example 2 was repeated except that no acetic acid was included in the monomer mix. Lenses could only be made for 10 hours before the monomer mix required reconstitution due to loss of activity of the initiator.<br>
Examples 4-8 (Stability Studies)<br>
Solutions containing 0.8 %wt of CGI 1850, and various reagents were prepared in a diluent, 3-methyl-3-pentanoI. Samples were analyzed by Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with Uv-Vis detection, to determine the presence of DMBAPO over time. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

Example 9-17 (Stability Studies in the Presence of Macromer)<br>
Solutions containing 10 %wt of the macromer described in example 1, 0.1 %wt of DMBAPO and various concentrations of acids, shown in Table 2, were prepared in 2-propanol. Samples were incubated at room temperature.<br>

Using the procedure of Examples 10-18, but storing at 45°C, the results shown in Table 3 were obtained.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Example 24 (Stability studies of DMBAPO in monomer mix containing macromer)<br>
Three monomer mixes of the type described in Example 2 (Lens formation) were prepared. Mix 1 contained no acid addition, Mix 2 contained 0.1 %wt concentrated HCI (37 %wt or 10.15M) and Mix 3 contained 1.0 %wt glacial acetic acid. Samples were incubated at 45°C and analyzed by Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with Uv-Vis detection., to determine the presence of DMBAPO over time. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>

Table 3<br>
It was also found that maintaining the pH of the initiator solution between about 3 and 8 resulted in stability of the DMBAPO.<br>
