FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having multiple planetary<br>
gear sets and at least seven torque-transmitting mechanisms engagable in different<br>
combinations to provide thirteen forward speed ratios and at least two reverse speed ratios,<br>
which may be operated as any of an eight to a thirteen-speed transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wide ratio transmissions such as seven or eight speed transmissions offer<br>
several advantages including improved vehicle acceleration performance and potentially<br>
improved fuel economy over four, five and six speed transmissions. However, increasing the<br>
number of speed ratios presents challenges in packaging additional clutches, drive<br>
mechanisms for the various gear members, and hydraulic circuit feed paths, and in ensuring<br>
an overall axial length that is acceptable.<br>
The prior art EP 0775851 B1 provides a power transmission arrangement with<br>
five forward speeds and a reverse speed using two simple planetary gear sets as defined in<br>
claim 1. The five forward speeds provided are two underdrives, a direct drive and two<br>
overdrives. The fourth and fifth forward ratios are both overdrives, use the same power path<br>
from the transmission input member, and swap the connection from the gearing output to<br>
the final drive mechanism of the transmission. The fourth ratio uses one gear set to establish<br>
an overdrive ratio and the fifth ratio uses both gear sets to establish a higher overdrive ratio.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved power<br>
transmission having two simple planetary gear sets producing five forward speed ratios and<br>
reverse ratio.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A multi-speed transmission is provided that achieves at least eight forward<br>
speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio using multiple planetary gear sets and at<br>
least seven torque-transmitting mechanisms engagable in different combinations.<br>
The multiple planetary gear sets have members representable by a three-node<br>
lever and a five-node lever. Each node represents at least one of the members of the <br><br>
planetary gear sets. The three-node lever has a first, second and a third node. The five- node lever has a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh and an eighth node. The seven torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms include three rotating clutches selectively connecting different<br>
nodes of the three node lever with different nodes of the five-node lever. One rotating clutch<br>
selectively connects the input member with one of the nodes of the five-node lever. The<br>
seven torque-transmitting mechanisms also include three brakes that ground selected nodes<br>
of the five-node lever to a stationary member. One of the nodes of the three-node lever is<br>
continuously grounded to the stationary member. The input member is connected to one of<br>
the nodes of the three-node lever and the output member is connected to one of the nodes<br>
of the five-node lever. The torque-transmitting mechanisms are engagable in different<br>
combinations to provide at least eight forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio<br>
between the input member and the output member. Of course, less than all of the forward<br>
speed ratios may be utilized; for example, the transmission may be operated as a six- or<br>
seven-speed transmission. Preferably, the torque-transmitting mechanisms are also<br>
engageable in additional different combinations to provide five alternate forward speed ratios<br>
between the input member and the output member. There are five different combinations of<br>
nine forward speed ratios selected from the eight forward speed ratios and five alternate<br>
forward speed ratios. These five different combinations of nine forward speed ratios are each<br>
operable in progression with single-transition shifts between each forward speed ratio. The<br>
shifts between the eight forward speed ratios and five alternate forward speed ratios include<br>
eighty different single-transition shifts.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the forward speed ratios is a direct drive speed ratio.<br>
Shifts between the direct drive speed ratio and eight others of the forward speed ratios are<br>
single-transitions shifts. Also preferably, each of the forward speed ratios may be obtained<br>
by a single-transition shift from at least five other of the forward speed, ratios. Shifts<br>
between the eight forward speed ratios include multiple single transition upshifts.<br>
Preferably, the seven torque-transmitting mechanisms include grounding clutch<br>
engaged in at least one of the eight forward speed ratios and in a reverse speed ratio for<br>
vehicle launch. In such an embodiment, this may enable the transmission to operate without<br>
a'torque converter if the grounding clutch is used for vehicle launch.<br>
With the seven torque-transmitting mechanisms described above, two<br>
reverse speed ratios may be established. If an additional torque-transmitting<br><br>
mechanism is provided that connects the input member and the third node to the fourth node, two additional reverse speed ratios may be established for a total of four reverse<br>
speed ratios that are operable in progression.<br>
[0008]	The multiple planetary gear sets include four planetary gear sets. The<br><br>
first planetary gear set is representable by the three-node lever. At least two of the<br>
second, third and fourth planetary gear sets are interconnected to form a compound<br>
planetary gear set such that the second, third and fourth planetary gear sets are<br>
represcntablc by the live-node lever.<br>
[0009]	In one embodiment, the input member is continuously connected for<br>
rotation with the third node and the output member is continuously connected for<br>
rotation with the seventh node.. The first node is continuously grounded to the<br>
stationary member. The first of the rotating clutches is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the second node for common rotation with the eighth node. The second of the rotating clutches is selectively cngagable to connect the third node for common rotation with the<br>
eighth node. The third of the rotating clutches is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
second node for common rotation with the fourth node. A fourth of the rotating<br>
clutches is selectively cngagable to connect the input member for common rotation with<br>
the sixth node. A first of the three brakes is selectively engagable to ground the sixth<br>
node to the stationary member. A second of the three brakes is selectively engagable to<br>
ground the fifth node to the stationary member. A third of the three brakes is<br>
selectively engagable to ground the fourth node to the stationary member. Optionally,<br>
a free-wheeling, one-way torque-transmitting mechanism is connected in parallel with<br>
one of the brakes such as the brake that connects the sixth node to the stationary<br>
member.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE, PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0027]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 illustrates a powertrain 10 mounted on and partially forming a<br>
vehicle (not shown). The powertrain 10 includes an engine 12 connected to a<br>
transmission 14. The transmission 14 is designed to receive driving power from the<br>
engine 12, as discussed below. The engine 12 powers an input member 16 of the<br>
transmission 14. A final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an output member 17<br>
of the transmission 14.<br>
[0028]	The transmission 14 includes a three-node lever 20 representing a first<br>
planetary gear set having a first, a second and a third member, represented by nodes A, B<br>
and C, respectively. The members may be a ring gear member, a sun gear member and a<br>
carrier member, although not necessarily in that order. Nodes,-A, B and C are referred to<br>
in the claims as the first, second and third nodes, respectively. As used herein, a "node"<br>
is a component of a transmission, such as a ring gear member, a carrier member, or a sun<br>
gear member, which is characterized by a rotational speed and which can act as a junction<br>
of torques applied to that component from other components and by that component to<br>
other components. The other components which,may interact with a given node include<br>
other coaxial members of the same set of planetary gears which appear as other nodes on<br>
the same lever. The other components which may interact with a given node also include<br>
interconnections to members of other planetary gear sets which appear as nodes on<br>
another lever, a stationary member such as the transmission case, and other transmission<br>
members.<br><br>
[0029]	The transmission 14 further includes a five-node lever 22 representing<br>
second, third and fourth planetary gear sets interconnected so as to be representable by<br>
nodes D, E, F, G and 1-I, respectively. As those skilled in the art will readily understand, two planetary gear sets may be represented as a single lever in a lever diagram when two<br>
different members of one of the planetary gear sets are connected for common rotation<br>
with two different members of the other planetary gear set. Each of the nodes D,.E, F, G<br>
and H represent a ring gear member, a sun gear member, or a carrier member, although<br>
not necessarily in that order. Nodes D, E, F, G and H are referred to in the claims as the<br>
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth node, respectively.<br>
[0030]	The input member 16 is connected for common rotation with node C. The<br>
output member 17 is connected for common rotation with node G. Node A is<br>
continuously grounded to a stationary member 24.<br>
[0031]	The transmission 14 also has selectively engagable torque-transmitting .<br>
mechanisms that provide various speed ratios, as described below. Torque-transmitting mechanism 50, a rolating-lype clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node B for<br>
common rotation with node H. Torque-transmitting mechanism 52, also a rotating-type<br>
clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node C for common rotation with node H.<br>
Another torque-transmitting mechanism 5.4, a stationary clutch, also referred to as a<br>
brake, is selectively engagable to ground node F to the stationary member 24. The<br>
notation F1 indicated in Figure 2 in the column for torque-transmitting mechanism 54<br>
represents an optional one-way freewheeling clutch which may be connected in parallel<br>
with torque-transmitting mechanism 54-to permit rotation of node F in only one direction<br>
(the direction of rotation of input member 16) when torque-transmitting mechanism 54 is<br>
not engaged. Torque-transmitting mechanism 55, another stationary clutch or brake, is<br>
selectively engagable to ground node E to the stationary member 24. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 56, also a brake, is selectively engagable to ground node D to the<br>
stationary member 24. Torque-transmitting mechanism 57, a rotating-type clutch, is<br>
selectively engagable to connect node B for common rotation with node D. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 58, a rotating-type clutch, is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
input member (and also node C) for common rotation with node F. Torque-transmitting<br><br>
mechanism 59, an optional rotating-type clutch, is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
input member (and also node C) for common rotation with node D.<br>
[0032]	 The torque-transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58 are<br>
selectively engagable in the different combinations of pairs, as illustrated in Figure 2,'to<br>
provide two reverse speed ratios (Rl and R2), eight forward speed ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd,<br>
4lh, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th) and five alternate forward speed ratios (1st*, 2nd*, 3rd*, 4th*<br>
and 5th*) between the input member 16 and the output member 17. Each speed ratio<br>
established in Figure 2 may also be referred to as a "gear". Each of the speed ratios 1st*,<br>
2nd*, 3rd*, 4th* and 5th* is higher than the correspondingly numbered speed ratio 1st,<br>
2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th, respectively, thereby providing a lower mechanical advantage. As<br>
described further below, torque-transmitting mechanism 54, used to partially establish<br>
certain of the speed ratios of Figure 2, may also be used in an integrated friction launch in<br>
lieu of a torque converter. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the<br>
engagement of these different combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms shown in •<br>
Figure 2 will result in thirteen forward speed ratios having different numerical values,.as<br>
well as two reverse speed ratios with different numerical values.<br>
]0033]	A controller (not shown) is operatively connected with the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms and is programmed with an algorithm to select different ones of<br>
the speed ratios set forth in Figure 2 to provide anywhere between eight and thirteen<br>
forward speed ratios. Although up to thirteen forward speed ratios (those listed in Figure<br>
2) may be available, only nine are operable in progression with single-transition shifts.<br>
Thus, a nine-speed transmission with single-transition shifts is provided. Alternatively,<br>
less than eight of the forward speed ratios may also be selected, such as to enable a six-<br>
speed, seven-speed or eight-speed transmission with single-transition shifts. The speed<br>
ratios chosen or permitted by the controller may depend upon whether single-transition<br>
shifts are desired. As used herein, a "single-transition shift" in the context of speed ratios .<br>
established with pairs of engaged torque-transmitting mechanisms means that one torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism remains engagedand another torque-transmitting mechanism is<br>
disengaged while a different torque-transmitting mechanism is engaged in shifting from<br>
one speed ratio to a subsequent speed ratio (whether in an upshift or a downshift). As is<br><br>
apparent from Figure 2, the eight forward speed ratios 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and<br>
8th are operable in progression with single-transition shifts. Additionally, there are<br>
multiple single-transition upshifts (shifts from a lower numbered speed ratio to a higher<br>
numbered speed ratio (i.e., 1 si to 2nd), which are shifts from a higher numerical speed<br>
ratio to a lower numerical speed ratio. /<br>
[0034]	The topology and ring gear member to sun gear member tooth ratios of a<br>
specific transmission embodiment implementing the lever diagram embodiment of Figure<br>
1 will determine the most pleasing progression of the forward speed ratios for a given<br>
application and/or driving situation. Because each of the speed ratios established as set<br>
forth in Figure 2 require only two torque-transmitting mechanisms to be applied, and<br>
because most utilize only one rotating clutch (i.e., only one" of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 50, 52, 57 and 58), hydraulic leakage losses are minimized, as these are<br>
more commonly encountered with rotating-type than with stationary-type torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms. Additionally, the transmission 14 is able to be used in both<br>
front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive applications, as the input member 16 and the<br>
output memberl 7 may be made co-linear, as corresponding input and output members in<br>
the stick-diagram embodiments of Figures 3-13 are arranged.<br>
[0035]	Referring to Figure 2, there are five different combinations of nine<br>
forward speed ratios operable in progression us'ing single-transition shifts. One such<br>
nine-speed progression is: lst-lst*-2nd*-3rd*-4th*-5th*-6th-7th-8th. A second nine-<br>
speed progression with single-transition shifts is: lst-2nd-2nd*-3rd*-4th*-5th*-6th-7th-<br>
8th. A third nine-speed progression with single-transition shifts is: lst-2nd-3rd-3rd*-<br>
4th*-5th*-6th-7th-8th. A fourth nine-speed progression with single-transition shifts is:<br>
lst-2nd-3rd-4th-4th*-5th*-6lh-7th-8th. A fifth nine-speed progression with single-<br>
transition shifts is: 1st-2nd-3rd-4th-5th-5th*-6th-7th-8th.<br>
[0036]	Referring to Figure 2, there are a total of eighty different single-transition<br>
shifts between forward speed ratios (i.e., between any two of the forward speed ratios 1st,<br>
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5lh, 1st*, 2nd*, 3rd*, 4th*, 5th*, 6th, 7th or 8th, counting both a downshift<br>
and an upshift between two given speed ratios as two different single-transition shifts).<br>
This is readily determined by noting that there are seven groupings of forward speed<br><br>
ratios in Figure 2 thai differ by only one torque-transmitting mechanism (i.e., by a single-<br>
transition shift). These are: (lsl-2nd-3rd-4th-5lh); (lst*-2nd*-3rd*-4th*-5th*): (1st-<br>
lst*); (2nd-2nd*-8ih); (3rd-3rd*-7lh); (4th-4th*-6th); (5th-5th*-6th-7th-8th). Thus, each<br>
of these groupings can be considered a different single-transition set. In each single-<br>
transition set, the number of single-transition shifts is:<br>
N*(N-1), where N is the number of speed ratios in the set.<br>
Therefore, summing all of the single-transition shifts in each of the seven sets listed<br>
t<br>
above gives:<br>
5*4 i 5*4 1-2*1 1-3*2-1-3*2 + 3*2 + 5*4 = 80.<br>
By comparison, a transmission that offers only six different forward speed ratios may<br>
have only twenty-two single-transition shifts. Each of the forward speed ratios of Figure<br>
2 is included in two of the seven groupings and can therefore transition to between five<br>
and eight of the other forward speed ratios with a single-transition shift in each instance.<br>
The ability to shift to a variety of different speed ratios with a single-transition shift in ;<br>
response to driver input or driving conditions, such as in response to sudden throttle input :<br>
(and associated increase in speed of the input member), is an advantage of the<br>
transmission 14.<br>
[0037]	rf the optional torque-transmitting mechanism 59 is provided, then two<br>
additional reverse speed ratios, not listed in Table 2, may be achieved by engaging<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 59 along with either torque-transmitting mechanism 54 or<br>
55, to provide two additional reverse speed ratios, one of which (established by<br>
engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 55 and 59) is operable at a higher<br>
numerical value than l
transmitting mechanisms 54 and 59) is operable at a numerical value between that of<br>
speed ratios R2 and RI. The optional torque-transmitting mechanism 59 may also be<br><br>
engaged with torquc-iransmiiling mechanism 50 to establish an additional underdrive<br>
speed ratio.<br>
J0038]	The alternate forward speed ratio 5th* is a direct drive speed ratio, having<br>
a numerical speed ratio of 1.0. That is, because torque-transmitting mechanisms 52 and<br>
58 are engaged, nodes II and l; rotate at the same speed as the input member, driving<br>
node G and the output member 17 to also rotate at the same speed as the input member.<br>
A direct drive speed ratio is very mechanically efficient relative to other speed ratios<br>
because no power is transmitted across moving gear meshes and there is therefore no<br>
inefficiency associated with the slight rolling or sliding motion of the teeth. Eight of the<br>
other forward speed ratios (5th, 1st*, 2nd*, 3rd,*, 4th*, 6th, 7th and 8th) can shift to the<br>
direct drive" speed ratio 5th* using a single-transition shift, as is evident from Figure 2.<br>
[0039]	Another feature of the transmission 14 of Figure 1 is that torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 54 is a grounding clutch (i.e., a brake) that is engaged in the<br>
lowest forward speed ratios I si and 1 st*, as well as in the lowest reverse speed ratio Rl in<br>
order for the transmission 14 to launch a vehicle (i.e., to cause rotation of the output<br>
member 17 from a stationary state). For example, the reaction torque provided by the<br>

same number of forward speed ratios and two reverse speed ratios (e.g., thirteen different<br><br>
forward speed ratios, five different combinations of nine which are operable in<br>
progression with single-transition shifts, etc.).<br>
(00119]	Figure 14 illustrates a powertrain 1210 mounted on and partially forming a<br>
vehicle (not shown). The powertrain 1210 includes engine 12 connected to a<br>
transmission 1214. The transmission 1214 is designed to receive driving power from the<br>
engine 12, as discussed below. The engine 12 powers an input member 1216 of the<br>
transmission 14. A final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an output member 1217<br>
of the transmission 1214.<br>
[00120]	The transmission 1214 is represented in lever diagram form in Figure 14<br>
and is the same as, and can be represented by the lever diagram transmission 14 of Figure<br>
1 as well. The transmission 1214 includes a three-node lever 20A representing a first<br>
planetary gear set having a first, a second and a third member, represented by nodes AA,<br>
BB and CC, respectively. The members may be a ring gear member, a sun gear member<br>
,and a carrier member, although not necessarily in that order. Nodes, AA, BB and CC are<br>
referred to in the claims as the first, second and third nodes, respectively.<br>
[00121]	The transmission 14 further includes a five-node lever 22A representing<br>
second, third and fourth planetary gear sets interconnected as a compound gear set having<br>
members represented by nodes DD, EE, FF, GG and HH, respectively. As those skilled<br>
in the art will readily understand, two planetary gear sets may be represented as a single<br>
lever in a lever diagram when two different members of one of the planetary gear sets are<br>
connected for common rotation with two different members of the other planetary gear<br>
set. Each of the nodes 1)13, HE, FF, GG and HH represent a ring gear member, a sun gear<br>
member, or a carrier member, although not necessarily in that order. Nodes DD, EE, FF,<br>
GG and HH are referred to in the claims as the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth<br>
node, respectively.<br>
[00122]	The input member 1216 is connected for common rotation with node CC.<br>
The output member 1217 is connected for common rotation with node GG. Node AA is<br>
continuously grounded to a stationary member'1224.<br>
[00123]	The transmission 1214.also has selectively engagable torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms that provide various speed ratios, as described below. Torque-transmitting<br><br>
mechanism SQL, a roiating-typc clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node BB for<br>
common rotation with node I-1H. Torque-transmitting mechanism 52L, also a rotating-<br>
type clutch, is selectively engagable to connect node CC for common rotation with node<br>
HH. Another torque-transmitting mechanism 54L, a stationary clutch, also referred to as<br>
a brake, is selectively engagable to ground node FF to the stationary member 1224.<br>
Torque-transmitting mechanism 55L, another stationary clutch or brake, is selectively<br>
engagable to ground node i-1* to the stationary member 1224. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 56L, also a brake, is selectively engagable to ground node DD to the<br>
stationary member 1224. Torque-transmitting mechanism 57L, a rotating-type clutch, is<br>
selectively engagable to connect node BB for common rotation with node DD. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism SSL, a rotating-type clutch, is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the input member 1216 (and also node CC) for common rotation with node FF. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 59L, an optional rotating-type clutch, is selectively engagable to<br>
connect the input member 1216 (and also node CC) for common rotation with node DD.<br>
[00124]	Thus, the transmission 1214 is the same as transmission 14, with nodes .<br>
AA, BB, CC, 0\X III::. FF, GO and HH corresponding with nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, G,<br>
and H, respectively. Torque-transmitting mechanisms 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59<br>
correspond with torque-transmitting mechanisms 50L, 52L, 54L, 55L, 56L, 57L, 58L and<br>
59L, respectively, and arc engagable in the same combinations to provide the thirteen<br>
forward speed ratios and two reverse speed ratios indicated in Figure 2.<br>
[00125]	Figure 15 illustrates one particular combination of eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio that may be attained with the transmission 1214 of<br>
Figure 14. As can be determined from Figure 15, the eight forward speeds are operable<br>
in progression from 1 si to 8th with single-transition shifts. There are also many single-<br>
transition skip shifts available. For example, the sixth forward speed ratio (6th) can shift<br>
to or be shifted to from every other forward speed ratio listed in Figure 15 except the first<br>
forward speed ratio (I st). Thus, underdrive speed ratios 2nd-5th can be accessed by a<br>
single-transition shift in the event of sudden throttle input (i.e., sudden increase in<br>
rotation of speed of the input member).<br><br>
|00126]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms SOL, 52L, 54L, 55L, 56L, 57L and<br>
58L arc sciectiveiy cngagablc in the different combinations of pairs, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 15, to a reverse speed ratio R, and eight forward speed ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,<br>
5th, 6th, 7th, and 8lh) between the input member 16 and the output member 17. Four<br>
additional underdrivc ratios can also be attained by engaging torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 50L instead of 521. in speed ratios 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th. These additional<br>
ratios allow flexibility on reacting to sudden throttle inputs. An over-drive ninth forward<br>
speed ratio is available by engaging torque-transmitting-mechanisms 55L and 58L. Thus, ,<br>
a total of thirteen different forward speed ratios are available.<br>
[00127]	As described further below, torque-transmitting mechanism 154, used to<br>
partially establish certain of the speed ratios of Figure 15, may also be used in an<br>
integrated friction launch in lieu of a torque converter<br>
[00128]	A controller (not shown) is operatively connected with the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms and is programmed with an algorithm to select different ones of<br>
the speed ratios set forth in Figure 15 to provide different combinations of the speed<br>
ratios. Less than eight of the forward speed ratios may also be selected, such as to enable<br>
a six-speed, seven-speed or eight-speed transmission with single-transition shifts. The<br>
speed ratios chosen or permitted by the controller may depend upon whether single-<br>
transition shifts are desired. As is apparent from Figure 15, the eight forward speed ratios<br>
1 st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7lh, and 8th are operable in progression with single-transition<br>
shifts. Additionally, there are multiple single-transition upshifts (shifts from a lower<br>
numbered speed ratio to a higher numbered speed ratio (i.e., 1st to 2nd), which are shifts<br>
from a higher numerical speed ratio to a lower numerical speed ratio.<br>
[00129]	13ecau.se each of the speed ratios established as set forth in Figure 15<br>
require only two torque-transmitting mechanisms to be applied, and because most utilize<br>
only one rotating clutch (i.e., only one of torque-transmitting mechanisms 50L, 52L, 57L<br>
and 58L), hydraulic leakage losses are minimized, as these are more commonly<br>
encountered with rolaiing-iypc than with stationary-type torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
Additionally, the transmission 1214 is able to be used in both front-wheel drive and rear-<br>
wheel drive applications, as the input member 1216 and the output member 1217 may be<br><br>
made collinear, as corresponding input and output members in .the stick-diagram<br>
embodiments of Figure 16 are arranged.<br>
(00130)	Another feature of the transmission 1214 of Figure 14 is that torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 541, is a grounding clutch (i.e., a brake) that is engaged in the<br>
lowest forward speed ratios 1st and 2nd, as well as in the lowest reverse speed ratio Rl in<br>
order for the transmission 1214 to launch a vehicle (i.e., to cause rotation of the output<br>
member 1217 from a stationary state). For example, the reaction torque provided by the<br>
stationary member 1224 when the torque-transmitting mechanisms 50L and 54L are<br>
engaged allows the output member 1217 to rotate in a forward direction, establishing the.<br>
i<br>
forward speed ratio 1st. Using a friction-based torque-transmitting mechanism that is<br>
necessary to establish a given speed ratio in order to launch the vehicle as well, provides<br>
packaging and weight savings relative to a transmission having the same gear sets and<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms but also requiring a torque converter.<br>
[00131]	If the optional torque-transmitting mechanism 59L is provided, then two<br>
additional reverse speed ratios, not listed in Table 15, may be achieved by engaging .<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 59L along with either torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
54L or 55L, to provide two additional reverse speed ratios one of which (the latter) is<br>
operable in progression at a higher numerical value than R2 and the other of which (the<br>
former) is operable at a numerical value between that of speed ratios R2 and Rl. The<br>
optional torque-transmitting mechanism 59L may also be engaged with torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 50L to establish an additional underdrive speed ratio.<br>
[00132]	Referring to Figure 16, one particular embodiment of a powertrain 1310<br>
having a transmission 1314 is shown in stick diagram form that is representable by the<br>
lever diagram of Figure 14 and the identical lever diagram of Figure 2, and is configured<br>
in accordance with and operable in like manner as the transmission 1214 shown in lever<br>

member 1316 of the transmission 1314. Final drive unit 19 is operatively connected to an<br>

pinion gears 1337, 1338, respectively. Pinion gears 1337 mesh with both the sun gear<br>

long pinion gears 1357 that mesh with the sun gear member. The carrier member 1356<br>

with ring gear member 1364. Pinion gears 1367 mesh with the pinion gears 1357 and<br>

with the ring gear member 1356. Sun gear member 1332 is continuously grounded to a<br>
stationary member 1324, such as a casing of the transmission 1314. Ring gear member<br>

[00137]	The transmission 1314 has seven selectively engagable torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50M, 52M, 54M, 55M, 56M, 57M, and 58M. Torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 50M is selectively engagable to connect sun gear member 1-362<br>

members representable by a three-node lever (20) and a five-node lever (22),<br>
with each node representing at least one of the members of the planetary gear<br>
sets. The transmission includes seven torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
(50,52,54,55,56,57,58) including three rotating clutches (52,57,58) selectively<br>
connecting nodes of the three-node lever (26) to nodes of the five-node<br>
lever(22), one rotating clutch selectively connecting the input member (16) with<br>
a node of the five-node lever (22) and three brakes (54,55,56) grounding selective nodes of the five-node lever (22) to a stationary member (24). The<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism (50,52,54,55,56,57,58) are engagable in<br>
different combinations to provide at least eight forward speed ratios and a<br>
reverse speed ratio between an input member (16) and an output member (17),<br>
and there are preferably five alternate forward speed ratios such that there are<br>
five different combinations of nine forward speed ratios operable in progression<br>
with single-transition shifts between each forward speed ratio.</td>
