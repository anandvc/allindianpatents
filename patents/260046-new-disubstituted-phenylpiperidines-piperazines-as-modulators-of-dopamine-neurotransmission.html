				<td>NEW DISUBSTITUTED PHENYLPIPERIDINES/PIPERAZINES AS MODULATORS OF<br>
DOPAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to new modulators of dopamine neurotransmission, and more specifically to new 4-(ortho, meta disubstituted phenyl)-l-alkylpiperidines and piperazines, and use thereof.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain. Since this discovery, made in the 1950s, the function of dopamine in the brain has been intensely explored. To date, it is well established that dopamine is essential in several aspects of brain function including motor, cognitive, sensory, emotional and autonomous functions (e.g. regulation of appetite, body temperature, sleep). Thus, modulation of dopaminergic function may be beneficial in the treatment of a wide range of disorders affecting brain functions. In fact, drugs that act, directly or indirectly at central dopamine receptors are commonly used in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, e.g. Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. However, currently available dopaminergic Pharmaceuticals can have severe side effects. For instance, dopamine antagonists are known to induce both motor (extrapyramidal side effects; EPS) and mental side effects (e.g. anhedonia, dysphoria, and impairment of cognition), and dopaminergic agonists are known to induce dyskinesias and psychoses (Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed./McGraw-Hill, USA. Chapter 18, p 407 - 416, Chapter 22, p 509-512, p 515-516). An approach adopted by many researchers to improve efficacy and reduce side effects of dopaminergic Pharmaceuticals, is to develop novel dopamine receptor ligands with selectivity at specific dopamine receptor subtypes or with regional selectivity. Yet another class of compounds acting through the dopamine systems of the brain are dopaminergic stabilizers, which have shown to be useful in the treatment of both neurologic and psychiatric disorders (A. Ekesbo, PhD Thesis, Uppsala University, Sweden: Functional consequences of dopaminergic degeneration; clinical and experimental studies using a novel stabilizer of dopaminergic systems: Ekesbo et al, (-)-OSU6162 inhibits levodopa-induced dyskinesias in a monkey model of Parkinson's disease, Neuroreport, 8, 2567, 1997; Tedroff et al. Long- lasting improvement in motor function following (-)-OSU6162 in a patient with Huntington's disease. Neurology, 22;53:1605-6, 1999; Gefvert 0. et al, (-)-OSU6162 induces a rapid onset of antipsychotic effect after a single dose. A double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Scandinavian Society for Psychopharmacology, 41st Annual Meeting, Copenhagen Denmark Nordic Journal of Psychiatry 54/2 93-94, April 2000: Carlsson et al, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol, Toxicol.,41, 237, 2001; Carlsson et al. Current Medicinal Chemistry, 11, 267, 2004).<br>
Another dopaminergic compound, which has been referred to as a dopamine-serotonin system stabiliser, as well as a partial DA D2 receptor agonist, is the recently-launched antipsychotic compound aripiprazole (Burris et al, Pharm. Exp. Ther, vol. 302, 381,<br>
2002.). Furthermore, compounds referred to as dopaminergic stabilizers have been described in WO01/46145, W001/46146, Pettersson et at. The development of ACR16. A new class of dopaminergic stabilizers. Society for Neuroscience 32nd Annual Meeting, Abstract 2002, Vol. 28 part 1 1028, Orlando USA 2002, and Nyberg et al Efficacy and tolerability of the new dopamine stabiliser ACR16 a randomised placebo-controlled add-on study in patients with schizophrenia 12th BIENNIAL WINTER WORKSHOP ON SCHIZOPHRENIA, 7-13 February 2004, Davos, Switzerland.<br>
The typical pharmacological effects which are characteristic for dopaminergic stabilizers as described in W001/46145, WO01/46146 and Pettersson et al. 2002 can be summarised as: 1) Increased turnover of dopamine in the terminal areas of the ascending dopaminergic projections of the mammalian brain; 2) No or only weak behavioural effects in otherwise untreated rats; and 3) Inhibition of behavioural effects induced by psychostimulants or psychotomimetic compounds in the rat. In the present invention this is referred to as a dopaminergic stabilizer profile.<br>
This invention relates to the field of treatment of mammals suffering from CNS disorders in which the symptoms can be affected by dopaminergic functions, where the treatment comprises administering to said mammal an amount of a new type of compound, with a dopaminergic stabilizer profile.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
Compounds belonging to the class of substituted 4-phenyl-N-alkyl piperidines have been reported previously. Among these compounds, some are inactive in the CNS, some display serotonergic or mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic pharmacological profiles while some are full or partial dopamine receptor agonists or antagonists with high affinity for dopamine receptors.<br>
Costall et al. European J. Pharm. 31, 94, (1975) and Mewshaw et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 295, (1998) report compounds which are substituted 4-phenyl-piperazines, most of them being 2-, 3- or 4-OH phenyl substituted and displaying DA autoreceptor agonist properties. Fuller R. W. et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeut. 218, 636, (1981) disclose substituted piperazines (e.g. l-(m-trifluoro-methylphenyl)piperazine) which reportedly act as serotonin agonists and inhibit serotonin re-uptake. The comparative effects on the 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid concentration in rat brain by l-(p-chlorophenol)-piperazine are disclosed by Fuller R. W. et al, Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 29, 201, (1980). Fuller R. W. et al, Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 17, 551, (1977) disclose the comparative effects on the 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid concentration in rat brain by l-(p-chlorophenol)-piperazine.<br>
Boissier J. et al Chem Abstr. 61:10691c, disclose disubstituted piperazines. The compounds are reportedly adrenolytics, antihypertensives, potentiators of barbiturates, and depressants of the central nervous system.<br>
\ number of differently substituted piperazines have been published as ligands at 5-HT1A -eceptors, for example Glennon R.A. et al J. Med. Chem., 31, 1968, (1988), Mokrosz, J. et al Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) 328, 143-148 (1995), and van Steen B.J., J. Med. Chem., 36, 2751, (1993), Dukat M.-L, J. Med. Chem., 39, 4017, (1996).<br>
3B2027703 discloses substituted phenyl piperazines as analgesics and psychotropic agents. GB1560271 discloses para-substituted meta-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazines and 'heir therapeutic use in CNS and cardiovascular disorders. US4202898 discloses substituted phenylpiperazines for the treatment of anxiety and depression. US3326916 discloses different N-alkyl substituted 4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazines for the treatment of anxiety and related psychiatric conditions. WO9811068 discloses substituted piperazines as selective dopamine D4 ligands to be used in the treatment of anxiety, de­pression, schizophrenia, obsessive ideas, Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia, nausea and gastro-intestinal tract disorders.<br>
A number of 4-phenylpiperidine derivatives are known. EP0369887 disclose substituted 4-(meta-trifluoromethylphenyl)-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines for treatment of anxiety. WOOO/03713 discloses a method for the treatment of schizophrenia and other dopamine system dysfunctions by using substituted l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines.<br>
Glennon et al. (US patent 6,057,371) claim a method for treating sigma receptor associated CNS disorder, comprising the adminstration of arylamines, including arylpiperidines, which are either unsubstituted or mono-substituted at the aryl ring. The compounds exhibit a high binding affinity with respect to the sigma receptor. WO 91/095954 states that the term "high affinity" is intended to mean a compound which exhibits an IC50 of less than 100 nM in the assay against 3H-DTG described in Weber et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 83: 8784-8788). Specifically, WO 91/095954 discloses compositions relating to "the discovery that certain phenylalkyl-amine, aminotetraline, piperazine, piperidine and related derivatives have high binding to the sigma receptor and unexpectedly low binding for the PCP and DA receptors" (see page 11, lines 33-36).<br>
WO 91/095954 and WO 93/00313 both require that the compounds have a high binding affinity to the sigma receptor and do not disclose that the compounds are pharmacologically active in the absence of sigma receptor affinity. In addition, clinical studies investigating the properties of sigma receptor ligands in schizophrenic patients have not generated evidence of antipsychotic activity, nor activity in any other CNS disorder. Two of the most extensively studied selective sigma receptor antagonists,<br>
BW234U (Rimcazole) and BMY14802, have both failed in clinical studies in schizophrenic patients (Borison et al, 1991, Psychopharmacol Bull 27(2): 103-106; Gewirtz et al, 1994, Neuropsychopharmacology 10:37-40).<br>
US4415736 discloses 4-(2,3-dimethoxy-phenyl)-l-methyl-4-piperidinol (col. 9 lines 18-19) as a synthesis intermediate<br>
In addition, it is known that compounds with formulae II (W001/46145) and III (W001/46146) possess dopaminergic stabilizer properties.<br><br>

However, WOOl/46145 (Formula II) only discloses mono-substitution of the aryl ring, and does not exemplify ortho-substitution. WO01/46146 does not disclose 2,3-disubstitution of the aryl ring, and it can be seen that alternative substitution patterns (e.g. 3,4-disubstitution in which the 4-position is halogen) are not as potent as the 2.3-jisubstitution disclosed in the present invention.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide new pharmaceutically active compounds, 2specially useful in treatment of disorders in the central nervous system, having increased potency as dopaminergic stabilizers.<br>
The substances according to the present invention have been found in rat tests to act preferentially on dopaminergic systems in the brain. They have effects on biochemical indices in the brain with the characteristic features of dopamine antagonists. However, the substances according to the invention show no, or only limited, inhibitory effects on spontaneous locomotion over a wide dose range. Furthermore, the substances according to the invention can induce a slight behavioural activation, in particular when baseline locomotor activity is low. However, the substances in the present invention inhibit the behavioural activation induced by psychostimulants and psychotomimetics.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>

As used herein the term CrC4 alkyl refers to an alkyl group containing 1-4 carbon atoms in any isomeric form. The various carbon moieties are defined as follows: alkyl refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical and includes branched or unbranched forms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, s-butyl and t-butyl. Alkyl is preferably ethyl or propyl. The term "allyl" refers to the group -CH2-CH=CH2.<br>
Inclusion of two substituents on the aryl ring of such compounds - one in the 2-position and the other in the 3-position - increases their potency in modulating dopamine neurotransmission. The unprecedented increase in potency of these 2,3-disubstituted compounds as compared to the mono-substituted, or the 3,4-disubstituted compounds, is illustrated in TABLE 1 and 4.<br>

Such brain injury may be induced by traumatic, inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, vascular, hypoxic or metabolic causes or by toxic reactions to exogenous chemicals, wherein the exogenous chemicals are selected from the group consisting of substances of abuse, pharmaceutical compounds, environmental toxins<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also be used in behavioural disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence as well as in impulse control disorders.<br>
They can also be used for treating substance abuse disorders as well as disorders characterized by misuse of food. They are further useful for treatment of a condition selected from the group consisting of sleep disorders, sexual disorders, eating disorders, obesitas, and headaches and other pains in conditions characterized by increased muscular tone.<br>
Neurological indications include the use of the compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions to improve mental and motor function in Parkinson's disease, and in related parkinsonian syndromes, dyskinesias (including L-DOPA induced dyskinesias) and dystonias. They may also be used to ameliorate tics and tremor of different origins. Moreover, they may be used to relieve pain in conditions characterized by increased muscle tone.<br>

The compounds according to the present invention have been shown to display dopaminergic stabilizer profile with improved potency. They have effects on biochemical indices in the brain with the characteristic features of dopamine antagonists, e.g. producing increases in concentrations of dopamine metabolites.<br>
The compounds of this invention show no, or only limited effects on spontaneous locomotion over a wide dose range (Table 2).<br>

(Table Remove)<br>
In some cases, in particular when the baseline activity is low, they can induce a slight behavioural activation (Table 3). The behavioural activation is limited, not reaching the profound increases in activity induced by direct or indirect dopaminergic agonists.<br>

The animals were placed in the motility meters immediately after drug administration and locomotor activity was recorded between 30 and 60 minutes (counts/30 min ± SEM). During this period the animals have habituated to their environment and therefore the locomotor activity is low in the control group.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
On the other hand, the preferred substances reduce the increase in activity induced by direct or indirect dopaminergic agonists, i.e. d-amphetamine and congeners (Table 4). The compounds of the invention were also found to be more potent than the comparative examples from W001/145, WO01/146 and US4,415,736 (which were found to be inactive).<br>

(Table Remove)<br>
Thus, the compounds of this invention show a dopaminergic stabilizer profile (seen in Table 1-4) with improved potency (seen in Table 1 and 4). Given the involvement of dopamine in a large variety of CNS functions and the clinical shortcomings of presently available Pharmaceuticals acting on dopamine systems, the novel class of dopaminergic modulators presented in this invention may prove superior to presently known<br>
dopaminergic compounds in the treatment of several disorders related to dysfunctions of the CNS, in terms of efficacy as well as side effects.<br>
Compounds in the present invention have also been shown to display high metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes measured as turnover at 15 minutes (Example 1: 3%, Example 2: 1%, Example 4: 4%, Example 7: 22%, Example 8: 49%) and high oral bioavailability in rat, exemplified by Example 1 (about 100%), Example 2 (87%), Example 7 (29%).<br>
These compounds are thus suitable for the preparation of orally-administered Pharmaceuticals. There is no guidance in the prior art how to obtain compounds with the dopamine stabilizer profile (Table 1 to Table 4) with improved potency on dopamine systems in the brain.<br>
Pharmacology<br>
Evidence is available that dopaminergic neurotransmission in the CNS is disturbed in psychiatric and neurological diseases. In many instances, for example in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, bipolar disorder and in dementia pharmacotherapies based on antagonism or agonism at dopamine receptors are useful, but not optimal. In recent years many efforts have been made in finding novel and selective compounds for dopamine receptor subtypes (Dl, D2, D3, D4, D5) with the aim to improve efficacy and reduce side effects.<br>
The present invention offers another principle for novel therapeutics based on interactions with the dopamine system. The invention provides compounds having, as their major feature, stabilizing effects on the dopaminergic system in the brain.<br>
Description of animal models used in the invention<br>
The compounds according to the invention have effects on brain neurochemistry similar to antagonists at dopamine D2 receptors (i.e. dose-dependent increases of the dopamine metabolite DOPAC, in cortical, striatal and limbic brain regions). The compounds according to the invention show no, or only limited inhibitory, effects on spontaneous locomotion. Under certain conditions they can induce a behavioural activation. The behavioural activation is limited, not reaching the profound increases in activity induced by direct or indirect dopamine receptor agonists. However, the preferred substances reduce the increase in activity induced by the indirect dopaminergic agonist d-amphetamine. The increase in activity after treatment with d-amphetamine is a standard model of hyperdopaminergia (Table 4). In this model, dopaminergic neurotransmission is increased by systemic administration of d-amphetamine at a dose that is sufficiently high to produce a large increase in locomotor activity. The ability of a compound to antagonize this hyperactivity reflects anti-dopaminergic properties, which are part of the dopaminergic<br>
stabiliser profile. Furthermore, antagonism of d-amphetamine induced hyperactivity is widely used as a standard assay of antipsychotic activity (see Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress Chapter 68, p 793-795).<br>
Another animal model of antipsychotic activity is based on administration of the glutamate antagonist MK-801. Glutamate antagonists (i.e. IMMDA antagonists), can induce psychoses in man (see Psychopharmacology, 4th Generation of progress Chapter 101, p. 1205 and 1207) and induce behavioural aberrations in animals. Thus, the ability of a drug to affect schizophrenia and psychotic states can be measured using behavioural models based on experimentally-induced hypoglutamatergic states. In this study the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (0.7 mg/kg i.p.) was used to create a hypoglutamatergic state where the rats display abnormal, hyperactive behaviour. Compounds in the present invention dose-dependently reverse the behavioural aberration induced by MK-801 (see Table 5).<br>
It is known that the dopaminergic systems of the brain interact strongly with other transmitter systems (see Psychopharmacology, 4th Generation of progress, Chapter 101, pages 1208-1209). Such interactions can explain the powerful effects of dopaminergic stabilizers on the behavioural aberrations induced by the glutamate antagonist MK-801 although these aberrations are not primarily based on or caused by changes in dopaminergic transmission.<br>

The animals were placed in the motility meters immediately after test compound administration and locomotor activity was recorded between 30 and 60 minutes after administration (counts/30 min ± SEM)<br><br>

Therapeutic use of dopaminergic stabilizers<br>
The claimed invention provides compounds having, as their major feature, stabilizing effects on the dopaminergic system in the brain. These compounds are useful for treating CIMS disorders in which the symptoms can be affected by dopaminergic functions. In support of this assertion, please see the following references:<br>

As shown by these references, the claimed conditions are recognized in the art as diseases which concern dopaminergic neurotransmission.<br>
Furthermore, pharmacological interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission is widely believed to be useful in the treatment of several CNS disorders, which are not generally believed to be directly caused by disruptions in dopaminergic neurotransmission. For example, the symptoms of Huntington's disease and other movement disorders can be treated with dopaminergic agents due to the involvement of dopamine in motor functions-(see Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress, Chapter 26, p. 295-301). Likewise, it is known that cognitive disorders (see Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress Chapters 25, p. 292, Chapter 120, p. 1417 and 1420, Chapter 123, p. 1447 and 1452 and 1455-1457) autism (see Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress Chapter 142, p. 1653 and 1661), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Csee Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress Chapter 141, p. 1643 and 1649-1650), sexual disorders Csee Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of progress Chapters 65, p. 743-746 and Chapter 22, p. 245 and 254) and eating disorders Csee Psychopharmacology 4th Generation of<br>
progress Chapters 137, p. 1600, Chapter 138, p. 1609-1610 and 1612) may be treated with agents which interact with dopaminergic transmission. Thus, the above references support the argument that the compounds of the invention would be useful in the treatment of such diseases.<br>
Depression<br>
Dopamine and norepinephrine are cathecholamines. The cathecholamine hypothesis of depression was formulated in the 1960s (Schildkraut 1967). Evidence exists for a role for norepinephrine in depression (Principles of Neuropsychopharmacology, 1997, Sinauer Asociates Inc, USA. Chapter 19, p838-9). Evidence also exists for a role for dopamine in depression (Principles of Neuropsychopharmacology, 1997, Sinauer Asociates Inc, USA. Chapter 19, p848). Abnormalites in the cortex have been reported in those suffering from major depression (Neuropsychopharmacology: The fifth generation of progress, 2002, American college of Neuropsychopharmacology, USA, Chapter 73,pl054 and chapter 74, p!067)<br>
Some antidepressants have a predominant effect upon the extracellullar levels of norepinephrine and dopamine versus 5-HT in the cortex , as measured by microdialysis. The common trait for all clinically effective classes of antidepressants is an elevation of the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the cortex (Tanda, Carboni et al. 1994; Millan, Lejeune et al. 2000). The clinically effective antdepressant mirtazapine (remeron) has been shown to increase predominantly extracellullar norepinephrine and dopamine in the cortex (See Figure 1, Devoto, Flore et al. 2004). As the compounds of the present invention elevate the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the cortex we argue that they function as antidepressants (see Figure 2, Example 2 in the present invention).<br>

The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the present invention, and their use in treating CIMS disorders. Both organic and inorganic acids can be employed to form non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds according to the invention. Suitable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention include those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as toluensulfonate, methanesulfonate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, acetate, lactate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, bitartrate, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, glycolate, saccharate, ascorbate, acetate, propionate, benzoate, pyruvate, pamoate [i.e., l,l'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)], phosphate, acid phosphate, sulphate or bisulfate salts. These salts are readily prepared by methods known in the art. It is also to be understood that compounds of the present invention can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, e.g, hydrated forms.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the invention may also comprise substances used to facilitate the production of the pharmaceutical preparation or the administration of the preparations. Such substances are well known to people skilled in the art and may for instance be pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, carriers and preservatives.<br>
In clinical practice, the compounds according to the present invention will normally be administered orally, rectally, nasally or by injection, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations comprising the active ingredient either as a free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic, acid addition salt, such as the hydrochloride, lactate, acetate or sulfamate salt, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a solid, semisolid or liquid preparation. Usually the active substance will constitute between 0.1 and 99% by weight of the preparation, more specifically between 0.5 and 20% by a weight for preparations intended for injection and between 0.2 and 50% by weight for preparations suitable for oral administration.<br>
To produce pharmaceutical preparations containing the compound according to the invention in the form of dosage units for oral application, the selected compound may be mixed with a solid excipient, e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches such as potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin, cellulose derivatives, a binder such as gelatine or polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, waxes, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores (prepared as described above) may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain e.g. gum arable, gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet can be coated with a polymer known to the man skilled in the art, dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents. Dyestuffs may be added to these coatings in order to readily distinguish between tablets containing different active substances or different amounts of the active compound.<br>
For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the active substance may be admixed with e.g. a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the active substance using either the mentioned excipients for tablets e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches (e.g. potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin), cellulose derivatives or gelatine. Also liquids or semisolids of the drug can be filled into hard gelatine capsules.<br>

Dosage units for rectal application can be solutions or suspensions or can be prepared in the form of suppositories comprising the active substance in a mixture with a neutral fatty base, or gelatine rectal capsules comprising the active substance in admixture with vegetable oil or paraffin oil. Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing from about 0.2% to about 20% by weight of the active substance herein described, the balance being sugar and mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain coloring agents, flavoring agents, saccharine and carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to the man in the art.<br>
Solutions for parenteral applications by injection can be prepared in an aqueous solution of a water-soluble pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active substance, preferably in a concentration of from 0.5% to about 10% by weight. These solutions may also containing stabilizing agents and/or buffering agents and may conveniently be provided in various dosage unit ampoules. The use and administration to a patient to be treated would be readily apparent to an ordinary skill in the art.<br>
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in the form of a solution, dry powder or suspension. Administration may take place via a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by<br>
the patient or through an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The compounds of the invention may also be administered via a dry powder inhaler, either as a finely divided powder in combination with a carrier substance (e.g. a saccharide) or as microspheres. The inhaler, pump spray or aerosol spray may be single or multi dose. The dosage may be controlled through a valve that delivers a measured amount of active compound.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in a controlled release formulation. The compounds are released at the required rate to maintain constant pharmacological activity for a desirable period of time. Such dosage forms provide a supply of a drug to the body during a predetermined period of time and thus maintain drug levels in the therapeutic range for longer periods of time than conventional non-controlled formulations. The compounds may also be formulated in controlled release formulations in which release of the active compound is targeted. For example, release of the compound may be limited to a specific region of the digestive system through the pH sensitivity of the formulation. Such formulations are well known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Depending upon the disorder and patient to be treated and the route of administration, the compositions may be administered at varying doses. The dosing will also depend upon the relation of potency to absorbability and the frequency and route of administration. Such doses may be administered once, twice or three or more times daily. The compounds of this invention can be administered to subjects in doses ranging from 0.01 mg to 500 mg per kg of body weight per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight, sex and condition of the subject being treated, the disease state being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of from 0.1 mg to 10 mg per kg of body weight per day, single or divided dosage is most desirably employed in humans for the treatment of diseases. Alternatively, the dosage level is such that a serum concentration of between 0.1 nM to 10 uM of the compound is obtained.<br>

The following tests were used for evaluation of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
In vivo test: Behaviour<br>
Behavioural activity was measured using eight Digiscan activity monitors (RXYZM (16) TAO, Omnitech Electronics, Columbus, OH, USA), connected to an Omnitech Digiscan analyzer and an Apple Macintosh computer equipped with a digital interface board (NB DIO-24, National Instruments, USA). Each activity monitor consisted of a quadratic metal frame (W x L=40cm x 40cm) equipped with photobeam sensors. During measurements of behavioural activity, a rat was put in a transparent acrylic cage (WxLxH, 40x40x30 cm) which in turn was placed in the activity monitor. Each activity monitor was equipped with three rows of infrared photobeam sensors, each row consisting of 16 sensors. Two rows were placed along the front and the side of the floor of the cage, at a 90° angle, and the third row was placed 10 cm above the floor to measure vertical activity. Photobeam sensors were spaced 2.5 cm apart. Each activity monitor was fitted in an identical sound and light attenuating box containing a weak house light and a fan.<br>
The computer software was written using object oriented programming (LabVIEW®, National instruments, Austin, TX, USA).<br>
Behavioural data from each activity monitor, representing the position (horizontal center of gravity and vertical activity) of the animal at each time, were recorded at a sampling frequency of 25 Hz and collected using a custom written LABView™ application. The data from each recording session were stored and analyzed with respect to distance traveled. Each behavioural recording session lasted 60 min, starting approximately 4 min after the injection of test compound. Similar behavioural recording procedures were applied for<br>
drug-naive and drug pre-treated rats. Rats pre-treated with d-amphetamine were given a dose of 1.5 mg/kg i.p.. 10 min before the recording session in the activity monitor. Rats pre-treated with MK-801 were given a dose of 0.7 mg/kg i.p.. 90 min before the recording session in the activity monitor. The results are presented as counts/60 minutes, or counts/30 minutes, in arbitrary length units. Statistical comparisons were carried out using Student's t-test against the control group. In MK-801 or amphetamine pre-treated animals, statistical comparisons were made against the MK801 or d-amphetamine controls, respectively.<br>
ED50 values for reduction of amphetamine-induced hyper-locomotion are calculated by curve fitting. For most compounds, the evaluation is based on 16 amphetamine pre-treated animals over the dose range 0, 11, 33 and 100 umol/kg s.c. in one single experiment, with complementary doses in separate experiments. Calculations are based on distance during the last 45 minutes of one hour of measurement. The distances are normalised to amphetamine-control and fitted by least square minimization to the function "End-(End-Control)/(l+(dose/ED50)slope)". The four parameters are fitted with the restrictions: ED50&gt;0, 0.5<slope end>0% of control. To estimate confidence levels for the parameters, the fit is repeated 100 times with a random evenly distributed squared weight (0 to 1) for every measurement value. Presented ED50-ranges cover 95% of these values.<br>
In vivo test: Neurochemistry<br>
After the behavioural activity sessions, the rats were decapitated and their brains rapidly<br>
taken out and put on an ice-cold petri-dish. The limbic forebrain, the striatum, the frontal<br>
cortex and the remaining hemispheral parts of each rat were dissected and frozen. Each<br>
brain part was subsequently analyzed with respect to its content of monoamines and their<br>
metabolites.<br>
The monoamine transmitter substances (NA (noradrenaline), DA (dopamine), 5-HT (serotonin)) as well as their amine (NM (normethanephrine), 3-MT (3-methoxytyramine)) and acid (DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), HVA (homovanillic acid)) metabolites are quantified in brain tissue homogenates by HPLC separations and electrochemical detection<br>
The analytical method is based on two chromatographic separations dedicated for amines or acids. Two chromatographic systems share a common auto injector with a 10-port valve and two sample loops for simultaneous injection on the two systems. Both systems are equipped with a reverse phase column (Luna C18(2), dp 3 urn, 50*2mm i.d., Phenomenex) and electrochemical detection is accomplished at two potentials on glassy carbon electrodes (MF-1000, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). The column effluent is passed via a T-connection to the detection cell or to a waste outlet. This is accomplished by two<br>
solenoid valves, which block either the waste or detector outlet. By preventing the chromatographic front from reaching the detector, better detection conditions are achieved. The aqueous mobile phase (0.4 ml/min) for the acid system contains citric acid 14 mM, sodium citrate 10 mM, MeOH 15% (v/v) and EDTA 0.1 mM. Detection potentials relative to Ag/AgCI reference are 0.45 and 0.60V. The aqueous ion pairing mobile phase (0.5 ml/min) for the amine system contains citric acid 5 mM, sodium citrate 10 mM, MeOH 9%(v/v), MeCN 10.5% v/v), decane sulfonic acid 0.45 mM, and EDTA 0.1 mM. Detection potentials relative to Ag/AgCI reference are 0.45 and 0.65V.<br>
ED50 values for the increase of DOPAC in striatum are calculated by curve fitting. For most compounds, the evaluation is based on 20 animals over the dose range 0, 3.7, 11, 33 and 100 umol/kg s.c. in one single experiment. The DOPAC levels are normalised to control and fitted by least square minimization to the function "End-(End-Control)/(l+(dose/ED50)slope)". The four parameters are fitted with the restrictions: ED50&gt;0, 0.5<slope or end="200%" of control table to estimate confidence levels for the parameters fit is repeated times with a random evenly distributed squared weight every measurement value. presented ed50-ranges cover these values.></slope>
In vivo test: Oral bioavailability<br>
Experiments are performed 24 hours after implantation of arterial and venous catheters. Test compound is administered orally at 12.5 umol/kg or intravenously at 5 umol/kg using the venous catheters, n=3 per group. Arterial blood samples are then taken during six hours at 0, 3, 9, 27, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and, 360 minutes after administration of the test compound. The oral bioavailability was calculated as the ratio of the AUC (Area under curve)   obtained   after  oral   administration   over  the  AUC   obtained   after  intravenous administration for each rat. The parameter AUC was calculated according to the following: AUC: the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last concentration measured (Clast), calculated by the log/linear trapezoidal method.<br>
The levels of test compound are measured by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Hewlett-Packard 1100MSD Series). The LC-MS module includes a quaternary pump system, vacuum degasser, thermostatted autosampler, thermostatted column compartment, diode array detector and API-ES spray chamber. Data handling was performed with a HP ChemStation rev.A.06.03. system. Instrument settings:MSD mode: Selected ion monitoring (SIM) MSD polarity: Positiv Gas temp: 350 °C Drying gas: 13,0 l/min Nebulizer gas: 50 psig Capillary voltage: 5000 V Fragmentor voltage: 70 V Analytical column: Zorbax eclipse XDB-C8 (4.6*150 mm, 5 urn) at 20 °C. The mobile phase was acetic acid (0,03%) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The flow rate of<br>
the mobile phase was 0,8 ml/min. The elution was starting at 12% of solvent B isocratic for 4,5 min, then increasing linearity to 60% over 4,5 min.<br>
Extractions procedure: Plasma samples (0,25-0.5 ml) were diluted with water to 1 ml, and 60 pmol (100 pi) internal standard (-)-OSU6241 was added. The pH was adjusted to 11 by the addition of 25 ul saturated Na2C03. After mixing, the samples were extracted with 4 ml dichloromethane by shaking for 20 min. The organic layer was after centrifugation transferred to a smaller tube and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was then dissolved in 120 ul mobile phase (acetic acid (0,03%): acetonitrile, 95:5) for LC-MS analysis (10 (Jl injected). The selective ion (MH+) was monitored for each Example, and MH+ 296 for (-)-OSU6241 ((3-[3-(ethylsulfonyl)phenyl]~l-propylpiperidine). A standard curve over the range of 1-500 pmol is prepared by adding appropriate amounts of test compound to blank plasma samples.<br>
In vitro test: Metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes<br>
Rat liver microsomes were isolated as described by Forlin (1980) Tox Appl Pharm. 54(3) 420-430, with minor modifications e.g. 3 mL/g liver of a 0.1 M Na/K*P04 buffer with 0.15M KCI, pH 7.4, (buffer 1) was added before homogenisation, the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 minutes instead of 15, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100.000 g instead of 105.000 g and the pellet from the ultracentrifugation was resuspended in 1 mL/g liver of 20% v/v 87% glycerol in buffer 1.<br>
1 uL of, 0.2 or 1 mM test substance diluted in water, and 10 uL 20 mg/mL rat liver microsome were mixed with 149 uL 37 °C buffer 1 and the reaction was started by addition of 40 uL 4.1 mg/mL IMADPH. After 0 or 15 minutes incubation at 37 °C in a heating block (LAB-LINE, MULTI-BLOK Heater or Iab4you, TS-100 Thermo shaker at 700 rpm) the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 uL pure acetonitrile. The protein precipitation was then removed by rejecting the pellet after centrifugation at 10.000 g for 10 minutes (Heraeus, Biofuge fresco) in 4°C. The test compound was analysed using HPLC-MS (Hewlett-Packard 1100MSD Series) with a Zorbax SB-CIS column (2.1*150 mm, 5 um) using 0.03% formic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase (gradient) or a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 (3*75 mm, 3.5|jm) using 0.03% acetic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase (gradient). The 15 min turnover was calculated as the fraction of test compound eliminated after 15 minutes, expressed in percent of 0 min levels, i.e. 100*[conc test compound at 0 min - concentration at 15 min] / cone at 0 min.<br>
Preparation of liver microsomes was performed as described in Forlin (1980). Protocols for incubation with liver microsomes are referred in Crespi et Stresser (2000), and Renwick et al (2001).<br>

Microdialysis<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 220-320g were used throughout the experiments. Before the experiment the animals were group housed, five animals in each cage, with free access to water and food. The animals were housed at least one week after arrival prior to surgery and use in the experiments. Each rat was used only once for microdialysis.<br>
We use a modified version (Waters, Lofberg et al. 1994) of the I-shaped probe (Santiago and Westerink 1990). The dialysis membrane we use is the AN69 polyacrylonitrile/ sodiummethalylsulfonate copolymer (HOSPAL; o.d./i.d. 310/220 urn: Gambro, Lund, Sweden). In the dorsal striatum we use probes with an exposed length of 3 mm of dialysis membrane and in the prefrontal cortex the corresponding length is 2.5 mm. The rats were operated under isoflurane inhalationanesthesia while mounted into a Kopf stereotaxic instrument. Co-ordinates were calculated relative to bregma; dorsal striatum AP +1, ML ± 2.6, DV -6.3; Pf cortex, AP +3,2 , 8° ML ±1,2 , DV - 4,0 .according to (Paxinos and Watson 1986). The dialysis probe was positioned in a burr hole under stereotaxic guidance and cemented with phosphatine dental cement.<br>
The rats were housed individually in cages for 48 h before the dialysis experiments, allowing them to recover from surgery and minimizing the risk of drug interactions with the anaesthetic during the following experiments. During this period the rats had free access to food and water. On the day of experiment the rats were connected to a micro perfusion pump via a swiwel and were replaced in the cage where they could move freely within its confinements. The perfusion medium was a Ringer's solution containing in mmol/l: NaCI; 140, CaCI2; 1.2, KCI; 3.0, MgCI2; 1.0 and ascorbic acid; 0.04 according to (Moghaddam and Bunney 1989). The pump was set to a perfusion speed of 2 ul/min and 40 pi samples were collected every 20 min.<br>
30 pi of each sample was injected into the chromatograph. On a 10-port injector (Valco C10W), with two sample loops mounted in series (2ul and 20ul), each brain dialysate sample is loaded in both loops simultaneously. When the valve is switched to inject the main part of the 20 ul sample is introduced into a reverse-phase ion-pairing system for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NA), normetanephrine (NM), 3-methoxytyramine(3-MT) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) determination (large loop), while a small fraction (2 ul, from the small loop) is introduced on a reverse-phase column for the chromatography of the acidic monoamine metabolites 3,4-di-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The currents generated by the two EC detectors are converted to digital data and evaluated using<br>
Chromelion software (Dionex, Sunnyvale, California) on a PC. The method sample turn over time was 4.5 min and two parallel experiments are normally analysed simultaneously on the system. After the experiment the rats were uncoupled from the perfusion pump and decapitated. Their brains were rapidly taken out and fixed in Neo-fix solution (Kebo-lab, Sweden) for subsequent inspection of probe localisation. The Animal Ethics Committee in Goteborg, Sweden approved the procedures applied in these experiments.<br>
