2.	Prior Art:<br>
Antimicrobial peptides are produced by both invertebrates and vertebrates. These peptides seem to play a critical role in the defense mechanism of these animals. Dermaseptins are a class of antimicrobial peptides, whose size range from 28-40 amino acids. They are produced by tree frog Phyllomedusa bicolor.<br>
Krugliak et al, [2000] have derived synthetic constructs from dermaseptins that are smaller than native peptide which still exhibited antimicrobial activity. Earlier patents for short bioactive anti microbial peptides were claimed by Owen, Donald R, 1^^ May, 2003 [US 20030083243]<br>
Here we describe designing an alpha helical alanine and lysine rich peptide which is different from lysine rich native peptide reported earlier. The designed peptide has higher hydrophobicity when compared to that of the native. The designed peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity and is not hemolytic [Figure 1].<br>
