				<td>METALLOCENE COMPOUNDS, CATALYSTS COMPRISING THEM,<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN OLEFIN POLYMER BY USE OF THE<br>
CATALYSTS, AND OLEFIN HOMO- AND COPOLYMERS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel metallocene compounds useful as components in polymerization catalysts, to catalysts comprising such metallocene compounds, to a process for the polymerization of olefms and to particularly propylene, and olefin homopolymers, random, and impact copolymers prepared by using the metallocene catalysts.<br>
2. Background of the Art<br>
One of the most important factors determining the success of a catalyst is its versatility, that is the possibility to use it for the broadest possible range of products. For a long time, the limitations for the development of metallocene catalysts for polypropylene has been their inability to produce propylene-ethylene copolymers of high molar mass, due to the fact that ethylene behaves as a chain transfer agent with most metallocenes. This effect has been observed for all basic metallocene structures, such as the syndiospecific Cs symmetric Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2, the aspecific C2v symmetric Me2Si(Flu)2ZrCl2, and both the C2 symmetric rac-Me2C(3-iPr-Ind)2ZrCl2 and the fluxional (2-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 catalysts for elastomeric polypropylene. This effect has also been found for the isospecific C2 symmetric rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4,5-Bcnz-Ind)2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-hid)2ZrCl2 [L. Resconi, C. Fritze, "Metallocene Catalysts for Propylene Polymerization" In Polypropylene Handbook (N. Pasquini, Ed.), ch. 2.2, Hanser Publishers, Munic 2005]. While the 2-Me substitution of this catalyst family suppresses the ß-hydrogen transfer to the propylene monomer and thus prevents the formation of low molar mass polymer, it fails to prevent the ß -hydrogen transfer to the ethylene comonomer in case of the latter's presence. This ß -hydrogen transfer to the ethylene comonomer becomes the favored chain termination mechanism and leads to the formation of low molar mass propylene-ethylene<br>
polymers [A. Tynys et al, Macromol. Chem, Phys. 2005, vol. 206, pp. 1043-1056: 'Ethylene-Propylene Copolymerizations; Effect of Metallocene Structure on Termination Reactions and Polymer Microstructure"]. Exceptions have been found in some zirconocenes with highly bulky ligands, such as rac-Me2C(3-tBu-Ind)2ZrCl2, which show a marked increase in molar masses by ethylene incorporation. This catalyst, however, has shortcomings in terms of homopolymer molar mass and activity.<br>
Another key requirement of a metallocene catalyst is its capability to produce polypropylene with a high melting point. This is equivalent with a catalyst that has a very high stereospecificity and regioselectivity. Within the rac-Alk2Si(2-Alk-liid)2ZrCl2 catalyst family, the stereospecificity and regioselectivity has continuously been improved during the last 15 years. EP-Al 834 519 relates to metallocenes of the rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ar-Ind)2ZrCl2 for the production of high rigid, high Tm polypropylenes with very high stereoregularity and very low amounts of regio errors. Although not tested for their copolymerization performance, the metallocenes disclosed in EP-Al 834 519 anticipated substitution patterns in 2-position that would later be identified as particularly suitable for the production of propylene/ethylene random copolymers when combined with additional substituents in certain positions. However, the highly stereo- and regio regular polypropylenes were not obtained under commercially relevant process conditions and suffered from too low activity/productivity levels.<br>
US-AI 2001/0053833 discloses metallocenes having substituents in 2-position consisting of an unsubstituted heteroaromatic ring or a heteroaromatic ring having at least one substituent bonded to the ring. Such catalysts afford C3/C2 copolymers with reasonably high molar mass, but fail to produce high Tm homopolymers under conditions typical for commercial scale production, i. e. on a support and at temperatures from 60 deg C and higher. Also, the productivities of this catalyst family are unsatisfactory.<br>
WO 01/058970 relates to impact copolymers having a high melting point and a high rubber molar mass, produced by catalysts comprising metallocenes of the rac-Me2Si(2-Alk-4-Ar-Ind)2ZrCl2 family. High molar.masses in the propylene/ethylene rubber were achieved when both Alk substituents were i-propyl groups. WO 02/002576 discloses bridged metallocenes of the (2-R-4-Ph-hid)2ZrCl2 family having particular combinations of<br>
substituents in the 2-positions of the indenyl hgands and the Ph substituents. A high polypropylene (PP) melting point is favored if the Ph group exhibits a substitution pattern in the 3 and 5 positions, particularly in case of butyl substituents. A combination of high homopolymer melting point and high copolymer molar mass is achieved if both substituents R in 2-position are isopropyl groups. The major shortcoming is the very low activity/productivity of the rac-Me2Si(2-R-4-Ar-Ind)2ZrCl2 catalysts if both ligands R are branched in the a-position. WO 03/002583 discloses bridged metallocenes of the (2-R-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 family having particular combinations of substituents in the 2-positions of the indenyl ligands and the 4-Ph substituents. A high PP melting point is favored if the Ph group exhibits a substitution pattern in the 2-position, particularly in case of biphenyl substituents. A combination of high homopolymer melting point and high copolymer molar mass is achieved if both substituents R in 2-position of the indenyl ligand are isopropyl groups. One major shortcoming is the very low activity/productivity of the rac-Me2Si(2-R-4-Ar-lnd)2ZrCl2 catalysts if both ligands R are branched in the a-position. Moreover, the highest possible molar masses of the homopolymers produced by using such catalysts are relatively low which corresponds to relatively high melt flow rates. This, in turn excludes such metallocenes from catering applications such as pipe, blown film, cast film and injection stretch blow molding.<br>
EP-A2 1 250 365, WO 97/40075 and WO 03/045551 relate to metallocenes having substituents in the 2-positions of either of the indenyl hgands with the imperative that at least one of the hgands in 2-position is branched or cyclicized in the a -position. WO 04/106351 relates to metallocenes having subsitutents in the 2-positions of the indenyl ligands with the proviso that one ligand is unbranched or bound via an sp2-hybridized carbon atom and the other ligand is branched in the a -position. Such catalysts afford high Tm homopolymers and high molar mass propylene/ethylene copolymers. However, there still are limitations with regard to catalyst activity/productivity and lowest achievable homopolymer melt flow rate.<br>
In summary, the main deficiency of supported catalyst systems comprising metallocenes of the above mentioned prior art, is that so far no catalyst has been found that, when used for the homopolymerization of propylene, affords isotactic polypropylene<br>
with a high melting point and very high molar mass (or very low melt flow rate) and that, when used for the copolymerization of propylene with ethylene, affords high molar mass propylene/ethylene copolymers, all at very high catalyst productivity. As a consequence, when compared to Ziegler/Natta catalysts, the industrial usefulness of these catalysts is limited because certain applications that require a combination of a high melting point, a very low melt flow rate, and/or a high molar mass copolymer or copolymer component, such as in impact copolymers, are not available at cost competitive productivities.<br>
An object of the present invention is to address this shortcoming of the state of the art metallocene compounds and to provide metallocenes that increase desirable charachteristics such as high melting point, high molar mass homopolymers and high molar mass copolymers, and do so at higher productivities when used as components of supported catalysts under industrially relevant polymerization conditions at temperatures of from 50 °C to 100 °C.   In addition, the inventions of the current example provide these advantages by using a Metallocene with symmetrically substituted 2 positions on the indenyl group. This is significantly more cost effective, and therefore far more desirable, than the comparative examples that have asymmetric substitution.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the polymerization of olefins, particularly propylene, ethylene, and optionally one or more higher 1-olefins.<br>
Furthermore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide olefin polymers, particularly propylene homopolymers, random copolymers of propylene with ethylene and/or higher 1-olefins, impact copolymers comprised of propylene, ethylene and/or optionally higher 1-olefins, and random impact copolymers comprised of propylene, ethylene and/or optionally higher 1-olefins.<br>
SUMMARY Certain metallocene compounds are provided that, when used as a component in a supported polymerization catalyst under industrially relevant polymerization conditions, afford high molar mass homo polymers or copolymers like polypropylene or propylene/ethylene copolymers without the need for any a -branched substituent in either<br>
the two available 2-positions of the indenyl ligands. The substituent in the 2-position of one indenyl ligand can be any radical comprising hydrogen, methyl, or any other C2-C40 hydrocarbon which is not branched in the a -position, and the substituent in the 2-position of the other indenyl ligand can be any C4-C40 hydrocarbon radical with the proviso that this hydrocarbon radical is branched in the p-position. This metallocene topology affords high melting point, very high molar mass homo polypropylene and very high molar mass propylene-based copolymers. Furthermore, the activity/productivity levels of catalysts comprising the metallocenes of the present invention are exceptionally high.<br>
While various matallocenes are described, for example, in U.S. Publication No. 2006/0116490, the improvement in olefin polymerization achieved by the metallocene topology of the present invention is new and unexpected.<br>

Instead of the preferred pure chiral bridged racemic or pseudoracemic metallocene compounds of formulas 1 and la, mixtures of the metallocenes of formulas 1 and la and the corresponding meso or pseudomeso metallocenes may be used in the catalyst preparation. However, the preparation of the isomerically pure racemic form is especially preferred for the use of metallocenes in the polymerization of olefins to isotactic<br>
polvolefms, since the corresponding meso form may produce undesired atactic polypropylene ("PP"). The "isomerically pure" racemic form is understood to mean a rac:meso ratio of greater than 5:1 preferably of at least 10:1, more preferred of at least 15:1 and most preferred of at least 20:1.<br>
As used herein the term "racemic" (or "rac") includes "pseudoracemic" (or "pseudorac"), and the term "meso" includes "pseudomeso."<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The present invention also includes a process for producing the transition-metal compounds of formulas 1 and la of the invention.<br><br>
An object of the invention is thus a process for producing compounds of formula la,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which the variables R and M  have the meaning specified above, including the preferred embodiments, comprising the steps of:<br>
a) Deprotonation of the compound of formula 2:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
with a base, in which R^*^, R', R^, R^, R*", and R^ have the meaning specified<br>
above.<br>
b)   If R'^ has the meaning M'R^R^', where M'\ R^, and R^' have the meanings specified above, then the further production proceeds by the reaction of the deprotonated compounds from step (a) with R'"^'"M'^X2 to form the compound<br>
of formula 3 or formula 4, depending on the quantitative proportions used, where R,R^', and Mohave the meanings specified above, and X may be the same or different and means a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or another leaving group, preferably triflate, tosylate, or mesylate.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
c)  After the production of chlorosilane indenes or chlorogermane indenes of formula 3, these are reacted with a metal-indene compound of formula 5<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which M stands for Li, Na, or K, and R\ R\ R\ R^ R\ and R^have the meanings specified above, to obtain the compound of formula 6.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
d)  Reaction of the compound of formula 4 or 6 with a base and addition of M'CU, in which M' stands for zirconium, titanium, or hafhium, to form the compound of formula la. hi step (a), the compound of formula 2, for example, 2-(cyclohexylmethyl)-7-(4'-/^er/-butylphenyl)indene in an inert solvent, which consists of one or more aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or one or more polar, aprotic solvents, is deprotonated with a strong base, for example, «-butyUithium. The deprotonation is carried out at temperatures of-70°C to 80°C, and preferably 0°C to 80°C. The resulting metal salt is then reacted directly, without fiirther isolation, in step (b) with a silicon compound or germanium compound that contains two leaving groups. Preferential production of the compound of formula 3 or the compound of formula 4 can be achieved by adjustment of the quantitative proportions. Compounds of formula 3 are reacted in step (c) with a metal-indenyl compound of formula 5. hi the following step (d), the bis(indenyl)silanes of formula 4 or 6 are doubly deprotonated with a strong base, such as «-butyllithium, in an inert solvent, which consists of one or more aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons and/or one or more polar, aprotic solvents, and the bislithium salt formed in this way is reacted, without isolation, directly with a source of Ti, Zr, or Hf to obtain the compound of formula la.<br>
Ti   deprotonation is carried out at temperatures of-70°C to 80°C, and preferably 0°C to 80°C. Depending on the nature of the Ugand system of formula 4 or 6, the metallocenes are isolated directly from the reaction mixture with rac:meso ratios or pseudo-rac:meso ratios of greater than 5:1 preferably of at least 10:1, more preferred of at least 15:1 and most preferred of at least 20:1 or further rac:meso separation steps have to be applied to reach rac:meso ratios or pseudo-rac:meso ratios of at least 5:1 preferably of at least 10:1, more preferred of at least 15:1 and most preferred of at least 20:1 to obtain a suitable catalyst.<br>
In Fig. 1, the individual steps of the process of the invention for producing transition-metal compounds of formulas la are shown once again for the example of a preferred embodiment.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a catalyst system comprising at least one compound of formulas 1 or la and at least one cocatalyst.<br>
A suitable cocatalyst component which may be present according to the present invention in the catalyst system comprises at least one compound of the type of an aluminoxane, a Lewis acid or an ionic compound which reacts with a metallocene to convert the latter into a catiomc compound.<br>
Aluminoxanes are oligomeric or polymeric aluminum oxy compounds, which may exist in the form of hnear, cyclic, caged or polymeric structures. Although the exact structure(s) of aluminoxanes is still unknown, it is well accqjted that alkylaluminoxanes have the general formula 7.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Examples for cyclic, linear or cage structures of aluminoxanes are depicted in the formulas 8, 9 and 10:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The radicals R in the formulas (7), (8), (9) and (10) can be identical or different and are<br>
each a C1 -C20 group such as an alkyl group of from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, an ary]<br>
group of from 6 to about 18 carbon atoms, benzyl or hydrogen and p is an integer from 2 to<br>
50, preferably from 10 to 35.<br>
Peferably, the radicals R are identical and are methyl, isobutyl, n-butyl, phenyl or<br>
benzyl, particularly preferably methyl.<br>
If the radicals R are different, they are preferably methyl and hydrogen, methyl and<br>
isoinutyl or methyl and n-butyl, with hydrogen, isobutyl or n-butyl preferably being present in a proportion of from 0.01 to 40% (number of radicals R).<br>
The aJuminoxane can be prepared in various ways by known methods. One of the methods comprises the reaction of an aluminum-hydrocarbon compound and/or a hydridoalummum-hydrocarbon compound with water, which may be gaseous, sohd, liquid or bound as water of crystallization, in an inert solvent such as toluene. To prepare an aluminoxane having different alkyl groups R, two different trialkylaluminums (AIR3 +A1R'3) corresponding to the desired composition and reactivity are reacted with water, cf S. Pasynkiewicz, Polyhedron 9 (1990) 429 and EP-A-0 302 424.<br>
Regardless of the method of preparation, all aluminoxane solutions have in common a variable content of unreacted aluminum starting compound which is present m free form or as an adduct.<br>
Furthermore, instead of the aluminoxane compounds of the formulas 7, 8, 9 or 10, it is also possible to use modified aluminoxanes in which the hydrocarbon radicals or hydrogen atoms have been partly replaced by alkoxy, aryloxy, siloxy or amide radicals.<br>
The amounts of aluminoxane and metallocene used in the preparation of the supported catalyst system can be varied within a wide range. However, it has been found to be advantageous to use the metallocene compound of formulas 1 or 1 a and the aluminoxane compounds in such amounts that the atomic ratio of aluminum from the aluminoxane compounds to the transition metal from the metallocene compound is in the range from 10:1 to 1000:1, preferably from 20:1 to 500:1 and in particular in the range from 30:1 to 400:1. In the case of methylaluminoxane, preference is given to using &gt; 30% strength toluene solutions, but the use of 10% strength solutions is also possible.<br>
As Lewis acid, preference is given to using compounds of the formula 11<br>

corresponds to the valency of M5 where this component is not identical with the above mentioned cocatalyst compounds. It is also possible to use mixtures of various metal compounds of the formula 17.<br>
Among the metal compounds of the formula 17 preference is given to those in which M5 is lithium, magnesium or alummum and R23  and R24"' are each alkyl of from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred metal compounds of the formula 17 are n-butyllithium, n-butyl-n-octyl-magnesium, n-butyl-n-heptylmagnesium, tri-n-hexylaluminum, triisobutylaliuninum, triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum or mixtures thereof<br>
If a metal compound of the formula 17 is used, it is preferably present in the catalyst system in such an amount that the molar ratio of M5 to the transition metal from the metallocene compound of formulas 1 or la is from 800:1 to 1:1, in particular from 200:1 to 2:1,<br>
The support component of the catalyst system of the present invention can be any organic or inorganic inert sohd or a mixture of such solids, in particulate porous solids such as hydrotalcites, talc, inorganic oxides and finely divided polymer powders.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxides, which are preferably employed include from the Periodic Table of Elements Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13 and 14, metal oxides such as silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, aluminosilicates, zeohtes, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2 or B2O3, CaO, ZnO, ThO2, Na2O, K2O, LiO2 or mixed oxides like Al/Si oxides, Mg/Al oxides or Al/Mg/Si oxides.

Preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 50 to 500 m /g, a pore volume in the range from 0.5 to 3.5 cmVg and a mean particle size in the range from 5 to 250 µm. Particular preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 200 to 400 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.8 to 3.0 cm"'/g and a mean particle size of from 10 to 100 µm.<br>
The support materials can be thermally and/or chemically be pretreated in order to adjust certain properties of the carrier such as the water and/or the hydroxyl group content.<br>
If the support material has a low moisture content or residual solvent content, dehydration or drying before use can be omitted. If this is not the case, as when using silica gel as support material, dehydration or drying is advisable. Thermal dehydration or drying of the support material can be carried out under reduced pressure with or without simultaneous inert gas blanketing (nitrogen). The drying temperature is in the range from 80 °C to 1000 °C, preferably from 150 °C to 800 °C and most preferred from 150 °C to 400 °C. The duration of the drying process can be from 1 to 24 hours. But shorter or longer drying periods are also possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, support materials with a weight loss on dryness (LOD) of 0.5 wt.% or less, and even more preferred with a LOD of 0.3 wt% or less are used. Higher amounts of physically adsorbed water up to 1 wt% are possible, but result in reduced catalyst activities. The loss on ignition (LOI) of the support material is preferably 1 wt% or greater or even more preferred between 1.5 and 3.5 wt%. The weight loss on dryness (LOD) is thereby defmed as the weight loss between room temperature and 300°C and the weight loss on ignition (LOI) as the weight loss between 300°Cand 1000°C.<br>
In addition or alternatively, dehydration or drying of the support material can also be carried out by chemical means, by reacting the adsorbed water and/or the surface hydroxyl groups with suitable passivating agents. Reaction with the passivating reagent can convert the hydroxyl groups completely or partially into a form, which does not show any adverse interaction with the catalytically active centers. Suitable passivating agents are silicon halides, silanes or amines, eg. silicon tetrachloride, chlorotrimethylsilane, dichlorodialkylsilanes, dimethylaminotrichlorosilane, N,N-dimethylanilin or N,N-dimethylbenzylamine or organorrfetallic compounds of aluminum, boron and magnesium, eg. aluminoxanes, trimethyialuminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, diisobutylaluminum hydride, triethylborane or dibutylmagnesium.<br>
As outlined above, organic support matenals such as finely divided polymer powders, can also be used and should, before use, likewise be freed from any adhering moisture, solvent residues or other impurities by means of appropriate purification and drying operations.<br>
Preference is given to using sihca gels having the defined parameters as support materials. Spray dried silica grades, which inherently exhibit meso and macro pores, cavities and channels are preferred over granular sihca grades.<br>
The supported catalyst system according to this invention can be made in various ways.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the above-described metallocene components of formulas 1 or la is brought into contact in a suitable solvent with at least one cocatalyst component, preferably giving a soluble reaction product, an adduct or a mixture.

The isolated catal&gt;^t is then dispersed in a non-reactive suspension media such as a paraffmic hydrocarbon solvent, a mineral oil or a wax ot mixtures thereof<br>

According to the present invention, for preparing a free-flowing and, if desired, prepolymerized supported catalyst system, in step b) of the catalyst preparations as mentioned above, instead of an aluminoxane or a mixture of aluminoxanes, at least one alkyl compound of elements of main Groups I to III of the Periodic Table, for example a magnesium alkyl, a lithium alkyl or an aluminum alkyl like trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutyllaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, trihexylalimiinum, tnoctylaluminum, tri-rt-butylaluminum, tri-«-propylalurainum, triisoprene aluminum, dimethyl aluminum monochloride, aluminum monochloride, diisobutyl aluminum monochloride, methyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, dimethyl aluminum hydride, aluminum hydride, diisopropyl aluminum hydride, dimethyl aluminum(trimethylsiloxide), dimethyl aluminum(triethylsiloxide), phenylalan, pentafluorophenylalan, and o-tolylalan, can be used. Preferred aluminum alkyls are trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum.<br>
In an even further embodiment of the present invention a free flowing and, if desired, prepolymerized supported catalyst system is prepared comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	preparing a trialkylaluminium/borinic acid mixture in a suitable solvent or suspension medium<br>
b)	applying the trialkylaluminium/borinic acid mixture to a porous, preferably inorganic, if necessary thermally or chemically pretreated support, which was prior treated with a base like N,N-diethylbenzylamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, N-benzyldimethylamine, N-benzyldiethylamine, N-benzylbutylaraine, N-benzyl tertbutylamine, N-benzylisopropylamine, N-benzylmethylamine, N-benzylethylamine, N-benzyl-1 -phenylethylamine, N-benzyl-2-phenylethylamine, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine,<br>
N li-diethylbenzylamine, N-methyl-N-ethylbenzylamine, N-methyldibenzylamine and N-ethyldi (benzyl) amine,<br>
c)	removing the major part of solvent from the resulting mixture to obtain a supported cocatalyst,<br>
d)	preparing a metallocene/supported cocatalyst mixture in a suitable solvent or suspension medium, where the metallocene component has one of the above-described structiires,<br>
e)	isolating the supported catalyst system and<br>
f)	if desired, prepolymerizing the resulting supported catalyst system with one or more olefmic monomer(s), to obtain a prepolymerized supported catalyst system.<br>
Preferred solvents for the preparation of the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture are hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures, which are liquid at the selected reaction temperature and in which the individual components preferably dissolve. The solubility of the individual components is, however, not a prerequisite as long as it is ensured that the reaction product of metallocene and cocatalyst components is soluble in the solvent selected. Suitable solvents are aLkanes such as pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane, heptane, octane and nonane, cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene. Very particular preference is given to toluene, heptane and ethylbenzene.<br>
For a preactivation, the metallocene in the form of a solid is dissolved in a solution of the cocatalyst in a suitable solvent. It is also possible to dissolve the metallocene separately in a suitable solvent and subsequently to combine this solution with the cocatalyst solution. Preference is given to using toluene. The preactivation time is from 1 minute to 200 hours. The preactivation can take place at room temperature of 25 °C. In individual cases, the use of higher temperatures can reduce the required preactivation time and give an additional increase in activity. Elevated temperatures in this case refer to a range from 25 °C to 100 °C.<br>
The preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture is subsequently combined with an mert support material, usually silica gel, which is in the form of a dry<br>
powder or as a suspension in one of the above mentioned solvents. The support material is preferably used as powder. The preactivated metallocene/cocatalyst solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture can be either added to the initially charged support material, or else the support material can be introduced into the initially charged solution. The volume of the preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture can exceed 100% of the total pore volume of the support material used or else be up to 100% of the total pore volume.<br>
The temperature at which the preactivated solution or the metallocene/cocatalyst mixture is brought into contact with the support material can vary within the range from 0 °C to 100 °C. However, lower or higher temperatures are also possible.<br>
While the solvent is completely or mostly removed from the supported catalyst system, the mixture can be stirred and, if desired, also heated. Preferably, both the visible portion of the solvent and the portion in the pores of the support material are removed. The removal of the solvent can be carried out in a conventional way using reduced pressure and/or purging with inert gas. During the drying process, the mixture can be heated until the free solvent has been removed, which usually takes from 1 to 3 hours at a preferred temperature of from 30 °C to 60 °C. The free solvent is the visible portion of the solvent in the mixture. For the purposes of the present invention, residual solvent is the portion present in the pores.<br>
As an alternative to the complete removal of the solvent, the supported catalyst system can also be dried until only a certain residual solvent content is left, with the free solvent having been completely removed. Subsequently, the supported catalyst system can be washed with a low-boiling hydrocarbon such as pentane or hexane and dried again.<br>
The supported catalyst system prepared according to the present invention can be used either directly for the polymerization of olefins or be prepolymerized with one or more olefinic monomers, with or without the use of hydrogen as molar mass regulating agent, prior to use in a polymerization process. The procedure for the prepolymerization of supported catalyst systems is described in WO 94/28034.<br>
As additive, it is possible to add, during or after the preparation of the supported catalyst system, a small amount of an olefin, preferably an alpha-olefin such as styrene or<br>
phdimethylvinylsilane as activity-increasing component or an antistatic, as described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/365,280. The molar ratio of additive to metallocene component of formulas 1 or la is preferably from 1:1000 to 1000:1, very particularly preferably from 1:20 to 20:1.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing a polyolefin by polymerization of one or more olefins in the presence of the catalyst system of the present invention comprising at least one transition metal component of the formulas 1 or la. For the purposes of the present invention, the term polymerization refers to both homopolymerization and copolymerization and the term copolymerization includes terpolymerisation or copoljonerisation of more than three different monomers.<br>
Preference is given to polymerizing olefins of the formula R'"-CH=CH-R", where R"" and R" are identical or different and are each a hydrogen atom or a radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and R"^ and R" together with the atoms cormecting them can form one or more nngs.<br>
Suitable olefins are 1-olefins, eg. ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyi-l-pentene or 1-octene, styrene, dienes such as 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, vinylnorbomene, norbomadiene, ethylnorbomadiene and cyclic olefins such as norbomene, tetracyclododecene or methylnorbomene. In the process of the present invention, preference is given to homopolymerizing propene or ethene or copolymerizmg propene with ethene and/or one or more 1-olefins having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, eg. 1-butene or hexene, and/or one or more dienes having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, eg. 1,4-butadiene, norbomadiene, ethylidenenorbomene or ethylnorbomadiene. Very suitable copolymers are ethene-propene copolymers, propene-1-pentene copolymers and ethene-propene-1-butene, ethene-propene-1-pcntcne or cthcnc-propcne-1,4-hexadiene terpolymers.<br>
The polymerization is carried out at from -60 °C to 300 °C, preferably from 50 °C to 200 °C, very particularly preferably from 50 °C to 95 °C. The pressure is from 0.5 to 2000 bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar.<br>
The polymenzation can be carried out in solution, in bulk, in suspension or in the gas phase, continuously or batchwise, in one or more stages. As an example, impact<br>
copolymers are preferably produced in more than one stage. The homopolymer or random copolymer content of such a polymer can be produced in (a) first stagc(s) and the copolymer rubber content can be produced in (a) consecutive stage(s).<br>
The supported catalyst system prepared according to the present invention can be used as sole catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins or preferably in combination with at least one alkyl compound of elements of main Groups I to III of the Periodic Table, for example an aluminum alkyl, magnesium alkyl or lithium alkyl or an aluminoxane. The alkyl compound is added to the monomer or suspension medium and serves to free the monomer of substances, which can impair the catalytic activity. The amount of alkyl compound added depends on the quality of the monomers used. To prepare olefin polymers having a broad or bimodal molecular weight distribution or a broad or bimodal melting range, it is recommended to use a catalyst system comprising two or more different metallocenes and/or two or more different cocatalysts. Alternatively two or more different catalyst systems of the present invention can be used as a mixture.<br>
As molar mass regulator and/or to increase the activity, hydrogen is added if required.<br>
The catalyst system may be supplied to the polymerization system as a sohd or in the form of a paste or suspension in a hydrocarbon or may be treated with inert components, such as paraffins, oils, or waxes, to achieve better metering. If the catalyst system is to be metered into the reactor together with the monomer to be polymerized or the monomer mixture to be polymerized, the mixing unit and the metering line are preferably cooled.<br>
Furthermore, an additive such as an antistatic or an alcohol can be used in the process of the present invention, for example to improve the particle morphology of the olefin polymer. In general it is possible to use all antistatics which are suitable in olefin polymerization processes. It is preferred to dose the antistatic directly into the polymerization system, either together with or separately from the catalyst system used.<br>
The polymers prepared using the catalyst systems of the present mvention display an uniform particle morphology and contain no fines. No agglomerates or deposits are<br>
obtained in the polymerization using the catalyst system of the present invention.<br>
The catalyst systems of the present invention give polymers such as polypropylene having high molecular weight and cover a broad range of stereospecificity and regiospecificity.<br>
The copolymers which can be prepared using the catalyst system based on metallocenes of formula 1 or la of the present invention have a significantly higher molar mass compared to the prior art. At the same time, such copolymers can be prepared usmg the catalyst system of the present invention at a high productivity and at industrially relevant process parameters without deposit formation.<br>
The polymers prepared by the process of the present invention are suitable, in particular, for producing products such as fibers, filaments, injection-molded parts, films, sheets, caps, closures, bottles or large hollow bodies such as pipes with excellent properties.<br>
EXAMPLES General Procedures<br>
The preparation and handling of the organometallic compounds were carried out under argon using Schlenk techniques or in a glove box. All solvents were purged with argon and dried over molecular sieves before use.<br>
The metallocenes produced were characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer, operating at 500 MHz using CDCI3 as the solvent.<br>
The polymers produced were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NME., DSC, GPC, TREF/ATREF, Melt Flow Rate and IR spectroscopy.<br>
1.	Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), determination of Mw and Mw/Mn<br>
A Waters Alliance/GPCV2000 equipped with a refiractometer, a triple capillary online viscometer (Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts, 01757 USA) and a light scattenng detector PD 2040 (Precision Detectors hic, 34 Williams Way, Bellingham, MA, USA) was used for the determination of the molar mass data of the<br>
saawales. 0.05 wt% solutions of the samples in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene were analyzed at a temperature of 145 °C using a Mixed B light scattering quality column (Polymer Labs 1110-6100LS) and a Mixed B guard column (Polymer Labs 1110-1120). Weight average molar mass (Mw) and the ratio of weight average molar mass to number average molar mass (Mw/Mn) were calculated using the Cumulative Matching % Broad Standard procedure that is available in the Waters Millenium 3.2 GPC software module.<br>
2.	NMR Spectroscopy<br>
Samples were prepared by weighing 0.32 g of polymer into 2.5 ml of a 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene/deuterobenzene-d6 (4:1 volume) mixture. Samples were heated to 125°C and mixed until a homogeneous solution was formed (typically 1 -4 hours). Spectra were obtained at 120°C on a Varian Inova 500 instrument (Varian Inc., 3120 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA) operating at a '^C-spectrometer frequency of 125.7 MHz and using a 10 mm probe. Spectra were obtained using 5000 scans employing a 7i/2 pulse of 10.0 jis, a recycle delay of 10.0 s and an acquisition time of 2.5 s. Waltz-16 decoupling remained on throughout the pulse sequence to gain the signal to noise enhancement due to the effects of nOe. Spectra were processed with 1 Hz of line broadening. The mmmm peak in the methyl region of the spectrum was used as an internal chemical shift reference and was set to 21.85 ppm.<br>
3.	Differential Scanning Calorimetry TDSC), determination of the polymer melting<br>
point Tm DSC measurements were carried out using a Mettler Toledo DSC 822e (Mettler-Toledo Inc., 1900 Polaris Parkway, Columbus, OH, 43240, USA). 4 mg of sample were weighed into a standard aluminum pan and subjected to the following temperature schedule:<br>
The samples were heated from room temperature to 220 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, maintained at this temperature for 5 min, then cooled down to -55 °C at a cooling rate of 20 °C/min, maintained at the same temperature for 5 min, then heated to 220 °C at a<br>
beiaiing rate of 20 °C/min. The melting point was determined from the second heating am as the temperature where the main peak was observed in the curve.<br>
4.	Analytical TREF (ATREF)<br>
The TREF experiment is carried out on a TREF system built from a modified Waters 2000CV instrument (Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, MA, 01757 USA). The 2000CV instrument is maintained at lAO^C in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solvent at 1 ml/min flowrate. To detect the polyolefm fractions eluting from the TREF column, the system uses a heated infrared IR4 detector (PolymerChar Company, Valencia Technology Park, P.O. Box 176, Valencia, VA, E-46980, PATERNA, Spain). For cooUng and heating of the TREF coluirm, the system uses a temperature-programmable HAAKE Phoenix II oil bath (Thermo Elecfron Corporation, 401 Millcreek Road, Marietta, OH 45750, USA). The TREF separation column is a stainless steel column of 100 mm long and 0.75 mm diameter packed with 20-micrometer cross-linked polystyrene beads. This TREF column is maintained at the 140°C temperature in the oil bath before the sample analyses. Polymer samples are dissolved in ODCB solvent at 140°C at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. One ml of the test sample of the resultant ODCB solution is injected into the TREF column by the auto-injection system of the Waters 2000CV instrument with a flowrate of ODCB set at Iml/min. Following the sample injection, the ODCB flow is diverted away from the TREF column. As the sample is kept inside the column, the column is allowed to cool down in the oil bath from 140°C down to 0°C at the coohng rate of 1.5 °C/min. In this cooling step, the polymer molecules in the test sample are precipitated onto the packing beads in the TREF column. While the column is still at 0°C temperature, a flow of hot ODCB at 1 ml/min is re-introduced to the TREF column for 2 minutes to elute the soluble fraction of the polymer sample and detected by the IR detector set at 3.4 micrometer wavelength. Then, the temperature is raised at a heating rate of 2 °C/min while the ODCB flow is maintained at 1 ml/min through the TREF column to elute the higher melting polymer fractions which are being detected on-line by the IR4 detector.<br>
5.	Melt Flow Rate (MFR)<br>
The MFR of the samples were determined according to ISO 1133 at 230°C. Two diffent loads were used: 2.16 kg and 5 kg. Values are reported as MFR(230/2.16) and MFR(230/5), respectivdy.<br>
6.	Productivity<br>
The productivity of a catalyst is determined by dividing the produced mass of polypropylene by the mass of catalyst used and the reaction time.<br>
7.	Yield<br>
The yield of a sample is determined by dividing the isolated amount of the desired product divided by the theoretical achievable amount of the product.<br>
The following abbreviations are employed: PP = polypropylene MC - metallocene Cat = supported catalyst system h = hour<br>

Comparative Example 23: 10.0 g of the methylalmninoxane treated silica prepared in Example 12 are placed in a flitted glass filter as a column with a smooth surface. A minimal amount of toluene is added and the treated silica is carefiilly stirred with a spatula to remove any air pockets in the column. The excess toluene is removed by filtration leaving a smooth surface. In a separate flask 277 mg of rac-dimethylsilanediyl(2-methyl-4-(4'-rerr-butylphenyl)indenyl)(2-isopropyl-4-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)indenyl)zirconium dichloride (prepared in Comparative Example 11) are mixed with 27 mL of toluene and 13.6 mL of a 30 wt-% solution of methylaluminoxane m toluene (Albemarle Corporation). The slurry is stirred at room temperature for one hour to give an orange solution. This solution is then carefiilly added on top of the methylaluminoxane treated silica and slowly filtered off within approximately 30 minutes. When the surface of the colored solution reaches the top of the silica, the filtration process is stopped and the filter cake is carefiilly and thoroughly<br>
stirred by means of a spatula. The catalyst is then allowed to rest for one hour. The residual solvent is filtered off and the catalyst is washed twice with isohexane (20 mL) and dried in a nitrogen purge to constant weight. The catalyst is obtained as free-flowing orange powder in a yield of 11.9 g.<br>
Example 24:<br>
To a stirred suspension of 100 g of silica (Grace XPO8001, dried at 180°C and 1 mbar for 16 hours, LOD 
10.0 g of the methylaluminoxane treated sihca are placed in a fritted glass filter as a column with a smooth surface. A minimal amount of toluene is added and the treated silica is carefully stirred with a spatula to remove any air pockets in the column. The excess toluene is removed by filtration leaving a smooth surface. In a separate flask 363 mg of rac-dimethylsilanediyl-bis-(2-(1-adamantylmethyl)-4-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)-1-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride (prepared in Example 6) are mixed with 10 mL of toluene and 33.4 mL of a 10 wt-% solution of triisobutylaluminum in heptane (Akzo Nobel). The slurry is stirred at room temperature for one hour. This solution is then carefully added on top of the methylaluminoxane treated silica and slowly filtered off within approximately 30 minutes. When the surface of the colored solution reaches the top of the sihca, the filtration process is stopped and the filter cake is carefully and thoroughly stirred by means of a spatula. The catalyst is then allowed to rest for one hour. The residual solvent is filtered off and the catalyst is washed twice with isohexane (20 mL) and dried in a nitrogen purge to constant weight. The catalyst is obtained as free-flowing powder in a yield of 12 g.<br>
Polymerizations:<br>
Polymerization Procedure (batch propylene homo- and co-polymerization):<br>
A dry and nitrogen purged 5 dm' autoclave equipped with a stirrer is charged with if desired 100 g of metallocene polymer seed bed. Optionally, a certain amount of hydrogen is metered in. Triisobutylaluminum (1 cm of a 10 wt.-% solution in heptane), liquid propylene (one-half of the total amount used for the run), and optionally, a certain amount of ethylene are metered in and the mixture is stirred for at least 5 minutes (stirrer speed 200 rpm) at 20 °C. Then supported metallocene catylyst, suspended in 5 cm3 of white oil, is injected with liquid propylene (one-half of total amount used for the run). The reactor is heated to the intemally measured run temperature (65, 60 or 30 °C) within 11 minutes. The polymerization reaction is allowed to proceed at the run temperature for either 15 or 60 minutes. During the 60 min copolymerization runs the reactor pressure was maintained by continuous feeding of ethylene and propylene. The polymerization is stopped by releasing the monomer and cooling down the reactor. The polymer is discharged and dried under reduced pressure.<br>
Fifty-eight separate tests of inventive examples and comparative examples and the results in the aggregate are shown in Tables 1 and 2. In additions. Tables 3 through 12 have been created to isolate various reactor conditions.<br>
Analysis of Results<br>
While the invention of the present application is so exceptional that it shows unexpected improvements over the whole class of Metallocenes, the applicants note that true comparisons of the effect of this invention must be evaluated upon metallocenes of similar structure of the indenyl group at other than the 2 position. Therefore, while part of this analysis will make aggregate comparisons between the several inventive examples and the comparative examples, individual catalyst comparisons should only be made when the substitutions in all positions of the indenyl groups other than the 2 position are the same to ensure the comparison of apples to apples. Therefore, individual catalyst comparisons<br>
should only be made between inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 (various P-branched in the two position of the indenyl group) to comparative examples 22 (straight chain in the two position of the indenyl group) and 23 (α-branched in the two positionof the indenyl) because the substitutions in all positions of the indenyl groups other than the 2 position are the same.<br>
Table 1 and Table 2 represent the raw data presented by test runs; the remaining tables 3-12 break that data out by the ratio of propylene to ethylene (or if it is a propylene homopolymer) and whether hydrogen was used in the polymerization process.<br>
Propylene homopolymers<br>
Analysis 1: Production of Propylene polymers without the ethylene comonomer and not in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of eight experimental Metallocene catalysts conforming to the requirements of the invention compared to four comparative examples. In the aggregate, the catalysts of the present invention showed more than a 50% increase in productivity while at the same time showing more than a 200% increase in Molecular Weight and almost a two degree Celcius increase in melting point (significant when the range of melting points for homopolymer polypropylene is 144 to 153). Further the catalysts of the current invention produced products with an aggregate MFR 2.16 of less than 1.5% of that of the comparative products and an aggregate MFR 5 of just greater than 2% of the comparative examples. This dramatic drop in MFR indicates a dramatic increase of Molecular Weight (more than 200%) and opens full access to application fields like film, pipe or sheets, where a high Molecular Weight is mandatory.<br>
The individual catalyst comparisons between inventive samples 13, 17 and 18 and comparative examples 22 and 23 are just as dramatic. When examples 13, 17 and 18 are compared to comparative example 22, all three inventive examples exhibit significantly<br>
lower MFR 2.16, MFR 5 rates and increases in Molecular Weight. Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 60%, and greater than 99%, and greater than 99% of the original value of example 22. For the MFR 5, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 78%, 89% and greater than 99% of the original value of example 22. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective increase of 16%, 5% and 26% over the original value. Even more surprisingly is that the inventive examples showed these dramatic improvements in product properties at approximately the same productivity levels, and in the case of inventive example 13, a 59% increase in productivity.<br>
When examples 13, 17 and 18 are compared to comparative example 23, all three inventive examples exhibit significantly lower MFR 2.16, MFR 5 rates and increases in Molecular Weight Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 88%, greater than 99%, and greater than 99% of the original value of example 23. For MFR 5, inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 90%, 95% and greater than 99% of the original value of example 23. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective increase of 118%, 97% and 137% over the original value. Productivity was also massively enhanced, respectively by a 277%, 93% and 103% increase over the original value.<br>
Analysis 2: Production of Propylene polymers without the ethylene comonomer and with the presence of hvdrogen.<br>
Table 4 shows the results of eight experimental Metallocene catalysts conforming to the requirements of the invention compared to four comparative examples. However, in this case, hydrogen was added during the polymerization process to enhance catalyst productivity and to regulate the Molecular Weight. In the aggregate, the catalysts of the present invention showed more than a 94% increase in productivity while at the same time showing more than a 32% increase in Molecular Weight and almost a one point three<br>
degree Celcius increase in melting point (significant when the range of melting points for homopolymer polypropylene is 146 to 155). Further the catalysts of the current invention produced products with an aggregate MFR 2.16 of less than 34% of that of the comparative products and an aggregate MFR 5 of just greater than 31% of the comparative examples.<br>
The individual catalyst comparisons between inventive samples 13, 17 and 18 and comparative examples 22 and 23 again are dramatic.<br>
When examples 13, 17 and 18 are compared to comparative example 23, all three inventive examples exhibit significantly lower MFR 2.16, MFR 5 rates and increases in Molecular Weight. Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 76%, 60%, and 76% of the original value of example 23. For MFR 5, inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 78%, 64% and 80% of the original value of example 23. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective increase of 61%, 18% and 65% over the original value. Productivity was also significantly enhanced, respectively by a 109%, 84% and 84% increase over the original value.<br>
When examples 13, 17 and 18 are compared to comparative example 22, productivity was significantly enhanced, respectively by a 67%, 47% and 47% increase over the original value, while making a product comparable commercial quality. A direct comparison of MFR and Molecular Weight values is not applicable in this case. The metallocene of the comparative example is well known to have a poor response to hydrogen, which would keep the molecular weight high and the MFR's low. The inventive examples all provide a far superior hydrogen response, which should lead to dramatically lower molecular weights and higher MFR's. That the inventive examples provide similar molecular weights and MFR responses (similar quality products) at far higher productivities, a very unexpected result.<br>
Propylene/Ethylene Copolymers<br>
The properties of products made from the inventive catalysts were tested at various levels of an ethylene/propylene mix to form copolymers. With the introduction of a new variable, the propylene to ethylene ration, far fewer datapoints were taken for the copolymers at each ratio because resources became limited, In each case the inventive catalyst from example 13 was tested, usually against the comparative catalyst from example 23. Occassionally other inventive catalysts were tested, but without a significant number of inventive catalysts being tested, an aggregate number would not be statistically significant for each propylene to ethylene ratio, with the exception of the ratio of 0.38, for which there were numberous data points.   However, an analysis was conducted on the aggregate of all copolymers which shows significant and unexpected results.<br>
Analysis 3: Aggregate values of all propylene/ethylene copolymers.<br>
Table 5 represents the average values for productivity, MFR and molecular weight for all test runs of the inventive catalysts when used to make propylene/ethylene copolymer as compared to the comparative catalysts when used to make the same. Whenever a value is reported as "less than" or "greater than" a value, that value is adjusted to the nearest number that would make the inventive examples look poorest and the comparative examples look best. In short. Table 5 is created in a manner to show the worst case for the inventive examples and the best case for the comparative examples.<br>
Even with these adjustments, the inventive catalysts, in the aggregate, show dramatic improvement over the comparative catalysts. The aggregate productivity of the inventive examples when used to make copolymers demonstrates a small improvement (1.5%) when compared to the comparative examples. However, this improvement proves to be quite significant when it is taken in light of the dramatic improvements to MFR 2.16, MFR 5 and Molecular Weight, all highly desirable qualitites. In the aggregate when<br>
making copolymers, the inventive catalysts have a MFR 2.16 value that is less than 0.2% of that of the comparative catalysts, demonstrating an extremely significant improvement. Likewise, in the aggregate when making copolymers, the inventive catalysts have a MFR 5 value that is 0.5% of that of the comparative catalysts, again demonstrating an extremely significant improvement, hi the aggregate when making copolymers, the inventive catalysts have an increase in molecular weight of 74% over that of the comparative catalysts, hi the aggregate, the inventive catalysts are clearly and unexpected far superior to those of the comparative catalysts.<br>
Analysis 4: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propvlene/ethvlene ratio of approximately 48 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, only one inventive catalyst (example 13) was tested against one comparative catalyst, (example 23), the results being presented in Table 6. As before, the inventive catalyst showed significant improvements over the comparative catalyst in all measured levels. Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive example 13 showed a 50% reduction of the original value of example 23. For MFR 5, inventive example 13 showed a 45% reduction of the original value of example 23. The molecular weight of the inventive example 13 showed an increase of 26% over the original value. Productivity was also significantly enhanced, with the inventive sample having all 8% increase over the comparative example's value.<br>
Analysis 5: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of approximately 31.5 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, two inventive catalyst (examples 13 and 14) and one comparative catalyst (example 23), were tested, the results being presented in Table 7. However, as noted before, the only vahd comparison may be made between inventive catalyst (example<br>
13] and the comparative catalyst (example 23) because the substitutions are the same in all positions other than in 2 }&gt;osition of the indenyl group, hiventive example 14 is not considered in this analysis, nor would it be valid to do so.<br>
As before, the inventive catalyst showed improvements over the comparative catalyst in all measured levels. While the MFR 2.16 value was the same for both examples, for MFR 5, inventive example 13 showed a 14% reduction of the original value of example 23. The molecular weight of the inventive example 13 showed an increase of 11.5% over the original value. Productivity was significantly enhanced, with the inventive sample having a 73% increase over the comparative example's value.<br>
Analysis 6; Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propvlene/ethylene ratio of approximately 15.8 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, two inventive catalyst (examples 13 and 14) and one comparative catalyst (example 23) were tested, the results being presented in Table 8. However, as noted before, the only valid comparison may be made between inventive catalyst (example 13) and the comparative catalyst (example 23) because the substitutions are the same in all positions other than in 2 position of the indenyl group. Inventive example 14 is not considered in this analysis, nor would it be valid to do so.<br>
In this case, once again the inventive catalyst achieves remarkably better productivity (12.5%) while still creating a comparable product of similar commercial value. The significantly increased productivity combined with the previously mentioned fact that Metallocene catalysts that are symmetrically substituted in the 2 position are far easier and more cost effective to make than asymmetrically substituted metallocenes demonstrate that this is an unexpectedly superior Metallocene catalyst.<br>
Analysis 7: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of Spproximately 10.1 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, two inventive catalyst (examples 13 and 14) and one comparative catalyst (example 23), were tested, the results being presented in Table 9. However, as noted before, the only valid comparison may be made between inventive catalyst (example 13) and the comparative catalyst (example 23) because the substitutions are the same in all positions other than in 2 position of the indenyl group. Inventive example 14 is not considered in this analysis, nor would it be vahd to do so.<br>
As with Analysis 6, the inventive catalyst in this example achieves better productivity (1.8%) while still creating a comparable product of similar commercial value. The increased productivity combined with the previously mentioned fact that Metallocene catalysts that are symmetrically substituted in the 2 position are significantly easier and more cost effective to make than asymmetrically substituted metallocenes demonstrate that this is an unexpectedly superior Metallocene catalyst.<br>
Analysis 8: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of approximately .5 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, two inventive catalyst (examples 13 and 19) and one comparative catalyst (example 21), were tested, the results being presented in Table 10. However, as noted before, the only valid comparison may be made between inventive catalyst with substitutions that are the same in all positions other than in 2 position of the indenyl group. These cases do not provide any opportunity for comparative analysis, but are provided for informational purposes only.<br>
Analysis 9: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of approximately .5 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
In this case, two inventive catalyst (examples 13 and 19) and two comparative catalyst (examples 20 and 21), were tested, the results being presented in Table 11. However, as noted before, the only valid comparison may be made between inventive catalyst with substutions that are the same in all pyositions other than in 2 position of the indenyl group. These cases do not provide any opportunity for comparative analysis, but are provided for informational purposes only.<br>
Analysis 10: Production of propylene/ethylene copolymers with a propylene/ethylene ratio of approximately .5 and without the presence of hydrogen.<br>
Table 12 shows the results of eight experimental Metallocene catalysts conforming to the requirements of the invention compared to four comparative examples. In the aggregate, the catalysts of the present invention showed more than a 525% increase in Molecular Weight.    Further the catalysts of the current invention produced products with an aggregate MFR 2.16 of less than 0.15% of that of the comparative products and an aggregate MFR 5 of just greater than 0.43% of the comparative examples. The productivity of these samples could not be determined in these cases because in all of these examples and comparative examples amorphous propylene/ethylene rubbers have been produced. Such polymers generally stick to the autoclace walls and to the stirrer and a quantitative discharge of the autoclave was not possible which makes the determination of the productivities unreliable. Commercially, polymers containing such rubber components are produced in a two step polymerisation where in a first step a homo polymer is produced and in a second step the rubber is produced. This mesure reduces the stickiness of the material and allows the commercial production and use of such important materials for applications where low temperature toughness is required (applications like bumpers for cars, fi-igerator and deep freezer food packaging, crates and pails).<br>
The individual catalyst comparisons between inventive samples 13, 17 and 18 and comparative examples 22 are just as dramatic. (Recall, other comparisons would not be valid due to alternative substitutions in all positions other than in 2 position of the indenyl group). When examples 13,17 and 18 are compared to comparative example 22, all three inventive examples exhibit significantly lower MFR 2.16 and MFR 5 rates. The Molecular Weights stayed the same or increased. Specifically for MFR 2.16, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 34%, 98%, and greater than 99% of the original vaJue of example 22. For the MFR 5, the inventive examples 13, 17 and 18 show a respective reduction of 36%, 98%, and greater than 99% of the original value of example 22. For the molecular weight, the inventive examples 13 produced the same molecular weight of comparative example 22 and examples 17 and 18 show a respective increase of 159% and 347% over the original value.<br>
The examples of the inventive catalyst consistently show dramatic improvement over the comparative examples in gains of productivity and molecular weight, and reductions in the MFR values.<br>
