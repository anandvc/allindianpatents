Oxadiazole derivatives having anticancer effects<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing a sulfonamide derivative having an oxadiazole ring as an active ingredient for treating or preventing cancer.<br>
Background Art<br>
An extracellular matrix, consisting of collagen, fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycan, etc., has a function to support tissues, and plays a role in propagation, differentiation, adhesion, or the like in cells, Metalloproteinases which are protease having a metal ion in the active site, especially matrix metalloprotemases (MMP), are concerned with the degradation of the extracellular matrix. Many types of MMP, from MMP-1 to MMP-23, have been reported.<br>
An MMP inhibitor has been developed as an anticancer agent as described in Chem. Rev, 1999, 99, 2735-2776, Current Pharmaceutical Design, 1999, 5, 787-819, etc..<br>
It is described in CANCER RESEARCH 53, 878-883, 1993. CANCER RESEARCH 53, 5365-5369, 1993, etc. that an activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is enhanced in cancer patients.<br>
It is well-known that MMP-9 is produced from immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, and its production is controlled by cytokines in The Journal of Immunology 4159-4165, 1996 and The Journal of Immunology 2327-2333, 1997.    This MMP-9 is thought to participate when a cell such as macrophage and lymphocyte destroys an extracellular matrix to wander around inflammation or tumor sites.    Accordingly, it is supposed that a strong inhibition of MMP-9 may decrease immune response,<br>
A sulfonamide derivative having an oxadiazole ring exhibits an MMP inhibitory<br><br>
activity as described in WO99/04780.<br>
Further, there are other sulfonamide derivatives exhibiting an MMP inhibitory effect.<br>

In the above situation, the inventors of the present invention have found that certain sulfonamide derivatives having an oxadiazole ring are useful as an anticancer agent with safety and high efficacy.<br>

MMP-9 was purchased from Calbioehem-Novabiochem International, Inc..<br>
The DNA fragment corresponding to MMP-8 Catalytic domain (^^Phe—^^^Gly) was amplified by PCR with specific primers and Human Bone Marrow cDNA which was on the market. The DNA fragment was cloned into an E. coli expression vector, pTrc99A containing the His-tag sequence and Enterokinase digestion site. The MMP-8 Catalytic domain expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (Isopropyl-/3-D-thiogalactopyranoside) , and the cell pellet containing MMF-8 Catalytic domain was obtained. (We used a slightly modified method described in Thau F. Ho M. Walid Qoronfleh, Robert C. Wahl, Trica A. Pulvino, Karen J. Vavra, Joe Falvo, Tracey M. Banks. Patricia G. Brake and Richard B. Ciccarellz ; Gene expression, purification and characterization of recombinant human neutrophil collagenase. Gene 146, (1994) 297-301). Isolation of MMP-8 from the ceil pellet was used by general techniques. After the cell pellet was dissolved in 6M urea, the solution was loaded onto a metal-chelating matrix. Subsequently, dialysis was used to remove urea and refold of MMP=8. And then active MMP-8 was obtained.<br>
Test example 2 : Assay for inhibitory activities on MMPs<br>
The enzymatic activity on MMPs was analyzed by the method described in "C. Graham Knight, Frances Willenbrock and Gillian Murphy : A novel coumarin-labelled peptide for sensitive continuous assays of the matrix metalloproteinases: FEBS LETT., 296", (1992), 263-266", The substrate (MOCAc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-A3Pr(DNP)-A]a-Arg-NHj) was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan.<br>
The measurement of the inhibitory activities (ICjo) was carried out by the following four methods;<br>
A)	Reaction with substrate, enzyme (MMPs) and inhibitor<br>
B)	Reaction with substrate and inhibitor, without enzyme<br>
C)	Reaction with substrate and enzyme (MMPs), without inhibitor<br>
D)	Reaction with substrate only<br><br>
ICso values were calculated by using the following formula and each fluorescence values of above four methods (A to D),<br>
% inhibition = {1-{A-B)/(C-D)} x 100<br>
IC50 means the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity.<br>

The doses of the compounds were 20 and 200 mg/kg or 2 and 20 rag/kg. At 14 day after tumor inoculation, tumor nodules formed in the lung of the treated mice were counted and the antitumor efficacy was evaluated. The following compound (B-1) was used as reference. The results were summarized in Table 17.<br><br><br>
