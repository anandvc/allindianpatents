				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of a novel lipase. The<br>
lipase of the present invention is produced by   using a   new bacterial strain for<br>
industrial applications. This enzyme so obtained has higher stability over a wide range<br>
of pH of 2 to 10, temperature of 4 to 80°C. It has shelf life upto 90 days having<br>
potential use in leather industry as a degreasing agent for beamhouse processing. It<br>
may also be used as an additive to laundry detergent formulations. The enzyme is a<br>
potential hydrolysing agent for   industrially important fats and oils while producing<br>
fatty acids. It may find use in esterification, transesterification and interesterification<br>
reactions. Moreover, resolution of racemic mixtures is possible by using this enzyme. It<br>
has also a potential use in pharmaceutical industry as a digestive aid.<br>
Lipase is widely distributed in vertebrates, plants and microorganisms. The natural<br>
substrates for lipase, as stated by Tombs (Biotechnology in food industry, Edited by<br>
MP Tombs, Prentice Hall, New Jersey, pp 127-146, 1991), are triacylglycerols having<br>
very low solubility in water. Under natural conditions, lipase catalyses the hydrolysis of<br>
ester bonds at the interface between an insoluble substrate phase and the aqueous<br>
phase in which the enzyme is dissolved. As reported by Macrae and Hammond<br>
(Biotechnology Genetic Engineering Reviews, 3,  193-219,  1985),  under  certain<br>
experimental conditions such as in the absence of water, lipase is capable of reversing<br>
the reaction. The reverse reaction leads to esterification and formation of glycerides<br>
from fatty acids and glycerol.<br>
As reported by Mukherjee and Hills (Lipase, their Structure, Biochemistry and Application, Edited by P Wooley and SB Petersen, Cambridge University Press,<br>
Cambridge, pp 49-75, 1994) lipase can be obtained from plants and most of the efforts<br>
in this area have been devoted to seed lipases from castor bean (Ricimis comrmmis),<br>
Vernonia anthelmintic, wheat germ, oats and rice bran. The enzyme may be produced<br>
either by grinding the plants followed by enzyme extraction or by solvent extraction<br>
method. Different categories of animal lipases, viz.  pancreatic, blood,  stomach,<br>
hepatic, lingual, brain, muscle, placenta, butter, egg, fish and invertebrates have been<br>
studied by Barrowman and Darnton (Gastroenterology 59, 13-21, 1970), Hamosh<br>
(Lipases , Edited by B Borgstrom and HL Brockman, Elsevier Amsterdam, 49-81,<br>
1984) and Carriere et al. (Federation of European Biochemists Society Letters, 338,<br>
63-68, 1994).The enzyme is produced from the respective animal organs by grinding<br>
the animal source followed by enzyme extraction using solvent extraction method.<br>
Though lipases from different plants and animals have been studied extensively over<br>
the years for various end uses, the main limitation of getting lipase lies in the<br>
availability and collection of the respective animal or plant sources for commercial<br>
production. Moreover, the availability of the amount of enzyme in the above sources is<br>
limited. For example, 40 gms of delipidated powder of pancreas yields only lOOO units<br>
of lipase enzyme.  Again, as reported by Brockerhoff and Jensen (Lipolytic enzymes,<br>
Academic press, New York,  p- 36, 1974), since the enzyme available in the above<br>
sources is intracellular in nature, additional downstream processing is necessary to<br>
extract the enzyme.<br>
General biological significance for lipases (triacyl glycerol acyl hydrolase, Enzyme Code 3.1.1.3) has attained importance with the advent of biotechnology. As reported<br>
by Macrae and Hammond (Biotechnology Genetic Engineering Reviews, 3, 193-219, 1985); Iwai and Mieko (Yushi, 32, 84-91, 1989), microbial lipases have high stability and specificity in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. Apart from their biological significance, microbial lipases have multifarious applications in many areas viz. leather processing industries, detergent formulations, oleochemistry, organic synthesis, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, textile, food processing etc. According to Bjorkling et al. (Trends in Biotechnology, 9, 360-363, 1991), the study of lipases is<br><br>
very important for mankind as development of new lipase enzyme technologies will result in their expansion into new areas and will have tremendous impact on an array of industries<br>
As reported by Thirstrup et al (Biochemistry, 33, 2748-2756, 1994), it is now well established that microbial lipases are preferred to those from other sources for commercial applications due to their multifaceted applications, easy manipulation, optimal production strategies and easy down stream processing. The advent of recombinant DNA technology for the improvement of microorganisms is one of the major reasons for choosing microbes as a first choice. The major advantage of using microbes is that unlike plant and animal sources, which have to be grown every time for harvesting the particular source of enzyme for processing, thereby lengthening the production time, maintenance of one microbial strain ensures production of desired quantity of an enzyme by subculturing the strain in the production media as and when required. As reported by Rao and Lakshmanan (Indian Chemical Engineer, 33(4), 9-10, 1994), activity of microbial lipase can be as high as 27500 Units/ml of enzyme. As<br>
mentioned by Priest (Encyclopaedia of Microbiology, 2, 81-93, 1992), microorganisms are characterised by the fact that they can synthesize extracellular enzymes, whose activity is many times greater than the intracellular level of activity and most of these enzymes are inducible in nature.The similar opinion has been expressed by Okeke and Okoto (Biotechnology Letters, 72, 747-750, 1990), who have reported that microbial Upases are inducible in some cases by the inclusion of lipid substrates in the growth media. The effect of culture conditions and media components has been extensively studied by Cordenons et al. (Biotechnology Letters, 75, 633-638, 1996); Kambourova et al. (Folia Microbiologia, 41, 146-148, 1996) and Montesinos et al (Applied Biochemistry Biotechnology 59, 25-37, 1996). Mostly, addition of lipids in the culture broth is found to increase the exo-lipase production as studied by Khan et al (Biochimica Biophysica Acta, 732, 68-77, 1967). According to Rao and Lakshmanan (Indian Chemical Engineer, 33(4), 9-10, 1994), common nitrogen sources for lipase production are soya bean meal, peptone, yeast extract, casein hydrolysate and corn steep liquor.<br>
As reported by Brune and Gotz (Microbial degradation of natural products, edited by Winkelmann, VCH, Weinheim, pp 243-263, 1992) and Peterson and Drablos (Lipases, their structure, biochemistry and application edited by Wolley and Petersen Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 23-48, 1994) a relatively smaller number of bacterial lipases have been studied as compared to plant and fungal Upases. Microbial lipases are most active within the temperature range of 30°C-40°C. The lipase of Talaromyces emersonii has been reported by Oso (Canadian Journal of Botany, 56, 1840-1843,<br>
1978) to have an optimum temperature of 40°C . Fukumoto et al (Journal of General<br>
and Applied Microbiology, 9, 353-361, 1963) have reported a lipase from Aspergilhis<br>
niger to be stable at 50°C. Aisaka and Terada (Agricultural Biological Chemistry, 89,<br>
817-822, 1981) have reported a lipase from Rhizopus japonicus with good stability at<br>
50°C. Yamaguchi et al (Agricultural Biological Chemistry, 37, 999-1005, 1973) have<br>
also  reported a  lipase from Chromobacterium viscosum exhibiting stability at 50°C<br>
and Humicolo lanuginosa lipase has been observed by Liu et al (Agricultural<br>
Biological Chemistry, 37, 157-163, 1973) to be stable at 60°C. However, Watanabe et<br>
al (Agricultural Biological Chemistry, 41, 1353-1358, 1977) have reported that a<br>
lipase from the bacterium Pseitdomonas nitroreducens variety thermotolerance has<br>
been found to be stable even at 70°C. Soberon-Chavez and Palmeros (Critical Reviews<br>
of Microbiology,20, 95-105,1994) have reviewed the literature extensively and have<br>
observed that Pseitdomonas Upases display special biochemical characteristics like<br>
thermoresistance upto 70°C and   pH stability in the range of 6.5-10, which are not<br>
common among the Upases produced by other microorganisms. According to the<br>
review report of Soberon-Chavez and Palmeros (Critical Reviews of Microbiology, 20,<br>
95-105, 1994), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, Pseudomonas<br>
fragi, Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas glumae are the prominent lipase<br>
producers among the Pseudomonas group and they have been extensively studied for<br>
their biochemical properties. No lipase has however been reported  to be stable over<br>
pH range as wide as 2-10. There has also been no report of a lipase exhibiting wider<br>
thermal stability in the range of 4-80°C. Therefore, new isolates producing highly<br>
active and stable enzyme systems are always preferred.<br>
No prior art is available on the production of lipase from Ralstonia pickettii<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production<br>
of a novel lipase, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use Ralstonia pickettii, deposited at<br>

The main advantages of the present invention are the following:<br>
i)         Unlike the conventional lipase, the enzyme of the present invention has wider<br>
stability in the pH range 2 to 10 and temperature in the range of 4°C to 80°C. ii)        This enzyme has been found to be stable in the presence of    different<br>
commercial detergents like aerial, surf-ultra at a concentration of 7mg/ml. iii)       The lipase of the present invention has been found to be able to remove olive<br>
oil from cotton fabrics with better efficiency in the presence of available<br>
detergents. iv)       The enzyme of the present invention can be used for degreasing greasy pelt<br>
either individually or   as   an additive to an available    commercial detergent<br>
based degreasing agent. It provides degreasing of about 70% at a concentration<br>
of 250Units per 30g of the pickled skin, v)        Ralstonia pickettii CLRI BTL1 lipase is observed to be effective in hydrolysis<br>
of industrially important oils for fatty acid production at ambient temperatures<br>
with very little product charring or discolouration, vi)       The cost of production is low as a simple salt medium is used, vii)      Ralstonia picksttii CLRI BTL1 lipase is effective in the removal of greasy soil<br>
when used as an additive in laundry formulations. <br><br><br><br><br>
