State of Maharashtra, India<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a contactor coil component to power an electronic timer for use in a star-delta starter. The invention, particularly, relates to a contactor coil component for powering an electronic timer adapted to enable switching OFF the star contactor and switching ON the delta contactor after a predetermined time period. The invention also relates to an arrangement comprising contactor coil component and electronic timer both being operatively interconnected adapted to produce reduced ac voltage for powering the timer.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
A star delta starter is used for switching induction motors. A star delta motor starter comprises of three electro magnetic contactors, a thermal overload relay and an electronic timer.<br>
When the star delta starter is switched ON, the starter connects the induction motor to the supply in star connection. After a predetermined time set in the electronic timer, the starter connects the induction motor in delta connection.<br>
An electronic timer is used in a star delta starter for enabling changeover from star to delta connection of the motor after a preset time.<br>
There are number of ways to power the electronic timer in a star delta starter. The methods are :<br>
A built-in transformer is part of the complete electronic timer.  The  primary side  of the  transformer  is  normally<br>
2<br><br>
connected to the mains supply. The circuit of the electronic timer derives reduced ac voltage from the secondary side of the transformer. The reduced ac voltage is fed to the rectifier in the electronic circuit. A typical electronic timer powered by a step down transformer is shown in figure 1.<br>
The other method, normally adopted for providing reduced ac voltage to the circuit of the electronic timer is by way of potential divider comprising of capacitors. A typical electronic timer powered by a potential divider is shown in figure 2.<br>
JP5146183 describes a load current detecting means which is subjected to A/D conversion through an A/D converting circuit and optimal Y times are calculated through an operating means based on current data and then a Y switch and a switch are controlled through a control means based on the calculation results to automatically set Y time for starting a motor or the like in Y-connection and Y- time to be elapsed before entering into steady operation in -connection at optimal values according to load condition and to prevent layer short or burning of motor.<br>
JP56010083 discloses a star-delta timer comprising plurality of relays which are excited with the ON position of a starting switch and starting of a motor in star connection. In addition, if a capacitor is charged upto prearranged voltage, a timing IC puts a transistor in 'ON'1 position, exciting another relay. Thus the star operation is finished and another capacitor is charge when the transistor is in 'OFF' position and the relay is returned by a sharp output from the trigger such as PUT, etc. As a result, delta operation is started<br>
3<br><br>
instead. Consequently it is possible to make the rapid return of the relay after the finishing of the star operation, and prevent the contact point from burning without necessity of special relay such as micro switch relay. No dual functioning of the star contactor namely switching and a power source to an electronic timer is found in the prior art.<br>
The present inventor have found that an arrangement comprising a novel coil means being designed in a manner such that it provides reduced ac voltage to the circuit of the electronic timer and an intermediate connection could be made with due regard to insulation requirement with respect to the outer turns thus enabling switching OFF the star contactor and switching ON the delta contactor after a predetermined time period. In a contactor coil bringing out of an intermediate connection is difficult and the present invention solves out this problem also.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Thus the basic object of the present invention is to provide an arrangement comprising a novel coil means to power an electronic timer for use in a star-delta starter.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide reduced ac voltage to the circuit of the electronic timer.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an intermediate connection/tapping.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide magnetic flux in the electromagnetic contactors.<br>
4<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a contactor coil component adapted to set up magnetic flux in the coil and provide reduced ac voltage to power an electronic timer, said coil component comprising :<br>
(i) former having plurality of modular frames wherein there is a pair of horizontal modular frames separated from each other by a predetermined distance but operatively connected to each other by a vertical modular frame;<br>
(ii) coil being wound around the vertical modular frame so as to provide an intermediate connection forming a loop of predetermined number of turns; and<br>
(iii) means for providing insulation partially and/or completely between the intermediate connection and the outer turns.<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention there is provided a contactor arrangement comprising an electronic timer and a contactor coil component as described in the first aspect above, wherein<br>
said electronic timer being operatively interconnected with the contactor coil such that reduced ac voltage is provided to the electronic timer; and<br>
said contactor coil component comprising :<br>
5<br><br>
(i) former having plurality of modular frames wherein there is a pair of horizontal modular frames separated from each other by a predetermined distance but operatively connected to each other by a vertical modular frame;<br>
(ii) coil being wound around the vertical modular frame so as to provide an intermediate connection forming a loop of predetermined number of turns; and<br>
(iii) means for providing insulation partially and/or completely between the intermediate connection and the outer turns.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The coil component of the present invention adapted to set up magnetic flux in the coil and provide reduced ac voltage to the electronic timer comprises former having plurality of modular frames. The former has a pair of horizontal modular frames separated from each other by a predetermined distance but having operative connection with each other by a vertical modular frame section which comprises of coil wound around its lateral surface. The coil is wound round in a manner to provide an intermediate connection forming a loop of predetermined number of turns. The number of turns is approximately 520. Number of turns varies from design to design. The said loop formation provides an external connection even after the coil has been wound completely. Means for providing insulation partially and/or completely between the intermediate connection and the outer turns comprises insulating sleeve which receives the intermediate<br>
6<br><br>
connection in a manner that the intermediate connection is brought out by forming a closed loop.<br>
The contactor arrangement as herein described comprises electronic timer which is operatively interconnected with the contactor coil such that reduced ac voltage is provided to power the electronic timer. The reduced voltage would depend on the input voltage specification of the timer, which in the present case is 24 volts approximately. However, the value of voltage does not restrict the scope of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the contactor coil is connected to a rated supply voltage upon which reduced predetermined voltage as stated above appears between two points of the coil (herein the points being referred to a point A and point B) which being designed in a manner to function as an auto transformer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the electronic timer comprises rectifier section comprising plurality of diodes which receives appropriate supply voltage from reduced ac voltage produced by the coil and the timer starts functioning based on the voltage between point A and point B which is transferred to the timer by means of tapping.<br>
Yet in another embodiment of the present invention the contactor incorporating the coil is herein described as "novel star contactor". The electronic timer which neither incorporates built-in transformer nor potential divider is herein described as "compatible timer". The "novel star contactor" and "compatible timer" are integral parts of star-delta starter. Whenever, the starter is switched ON, the star<br>
7<br><br>
contactors normally close so as to connect an equipment (herein it is induction motor) in star connection. The said "compatible timer" derives the necessary supply voltage from the "novel star contactor". The "compatible timer" facilitates disconnection of the "novel star contactor coil" and is adapted to effect connection of coil of delta contactor to the supply after the preset time of the timer. The preset time for changeover from star to delta connection ranges from 10 seconds to 120 seconds. Thus changeover from star connection to delta connection of the equipment (herein it is induction motor) is achieved by the star-delta starter.<br>
