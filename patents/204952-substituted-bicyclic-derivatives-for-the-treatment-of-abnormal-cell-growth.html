COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SUBSTITUTED  BICYCLIC  DERIVATIVES  FOR THE TREATMENT  OF ABNORMAL CELL GROWTH"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Background of the Invention This invention relates to novel bicyclic derivatives that are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of abnormal cell growth in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
It is known that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (i.e., a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation. Alternatively, the overexpression of a normal proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase may also result in proliferative disorders, sometimes resulting in a malignant phenotype.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding, domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, a ' transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Other receptor tyrosine kinases include c-erbB-2, c-met, tie-2, PDGFr, FGFr, and VEGFR. It is known that such kinases are frequently aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. It has also been shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which possesses tyrosine kinase activity, is mutated and/or overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors.<br>
Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells. For example, erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma which expresses epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does not express the EGF receptor. Thus, the compounds of the present invention, which are selective inhibitors of certain receptor tyrosine kinases, are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, in particular cancer, in mammals. In addition to receptor tyrosine kianses, the compounds of the present invention can also display inhibitory activity against a variety of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases (eg: Ick, src, abl) or serine/threonine kinases (e.g.: cyclin dependent kinases).<br><br>
Various other compounds, such as styrene derivatives, have also been shown to possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. More recently, five European patent publications, namely EP 0 566 226 A1 (published October 20,1993), EP 0 602 851 A1 (published June 22, 1994), EP 0 635 507 A1 (published January 25,1995), EP 0 635 498 A1 (published January 25. 1995), and EP 0 520 722 A1 (published December 30,1992), refer to certain bicyclic derivatives, in particular quinazoline derivatives, as possessing anti-cancer properties that result from their tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Also, World Patent Application WO 92/20642 (published November 26, 1992), refers to certain bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful in inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation. World Patent Applications WO96/16960 (published June 6, 1996), WO 96/09294 (published March 6, 1996), WO 97/30034 (published August 21, 1997), WO 98/02434 (published January 22, 1998), WO 98/02437 (published January 22, 1998), and WO 98/02438 (published January 22,1998), also refer to substituted bicydic heteroaromatic derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful for the same purpose. Other patent applications that refer to anti-cancer compounds are United States patent application numbers 09/488,350 (filed January 20, 2000) and 09/488,378 (filed January 20,2000), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>

The compounds of the present invention have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric and di'astereomeric forms. This invention refates to the use of af( optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the present invention, and mixtures thereof, and to all pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment that may employ or contain them.

The   subject   invention   also   includes   isotopically-labelled   compounds,   and   the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, which are identical to those recited in formula 1, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.   Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 1SN, ieO, 170,35S, 18F. and 36CI, respectively.

Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.    Isotopically labelled compounds of formula 1 of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.<br>

The foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.   Certain starting materials may be prepared according to methods familiar to those skilled in the art and certain synthetic modifications may be done according to methods familiar to those skilled in the art.

Organic Reactions, 1982, 27, 345 or Cabri et. al. in Ace. Chem. Res. 1995, 28, 2.   For examples of the palladium catalyzed coupling of terminal alkynes to aryl halides see: Castro et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1963, 28, 3136. or Sonogashira et. al. Synthesis, 1977,   777.

Starting materials, the synthesis of which is not specifically described above, are either commercially available or can be prepared using methods well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In each of the reactions discussed or illustrated in the Schemes above, pressure is not critical unless otherwise indicated.    Pressures from about 0.5 atmospheres to about 5<br><br>
atmospheres are generally acceptable, and ambient pressure, Le., about 1 atmosphere, is preferred as a matter of convenience.<br>
With reference to Scheme 1 above, the compound of formula 1 may be prepared by coupling the compound of formula D wherein R4 and Rs are defined above, with an amine of formula E wherein R\ R3 and R11 are as defined above, in an anhydrous solvent, in particular a solvent selected from DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), DME (ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), DCE (dichloroethane) and f-butanol, and phenol, or a mixture of the foregoing solvents, a temperature within the range of about 50-150°C for a period ranging from 1 hour to 48 hours. The heteroaryloxyanilines of formula E may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as, reduction of the corresponding nitro intermediates.

Med. Chem. Lett., 7,10, 1997, 1345; Loupy, A. et. al., Synth. Commun., 20, 18, 1990, 2855; or Brunelle, D. J., Tet. Lett., 25, 32, 1984, 3383. Compounds of formula E in which R1 is a C^Ce alkyl group may be prepared by reductive amination of the parent aniline with R1CH(0). The compound of formula D may be prepared by treating a compound of formula C, wherein Z1 is an activating group, such as bromo, iodo, -N2, or -OTf (which is -OS02CF3), or the precursor of an activating group such as N02, NH2 or OH, with a coupling partner, such as a terminal alkyne, terminal alkene, vinyl halide, vinyl stannane, vinylborane, alkyl borane, or an alkyl or alkenyl zinc reagent.   The compound of formula C can be prepared by treating a compound of formula B with a chlorinating reagent such as POCI3, SOCI2 or CIC(0)C(0)CI/DMF in a halogenated solvent at a temperature ranging from about 60°C to 150°C for a period ranging from about 2 to 24 hours. Compounds of formula B may be prepared from a compound of formula A wherein Z1 is as described above and Z2 is NH2, C1C6 alkoxy or OH, according to one or more procedures described in WO 95/19774, referred to above.<br>
Any compound of formula 1 can be converted into another compound of fomiula 1 by standard manipulations to the R4 group. These methods are known to those skilled in the art and include a) removal of a protecting group by methods outlined in T. W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Edition, John WiJey and Sons, New York, 1991; b) displacement of a leaving group (halide, mesylate, tosylate, etc) with a primary or secondary amine, thiol or alcohol to form a secondary or tertiary amine, thioether or ether, respectively; c) treatment of phenyl (or substituted phenyl) carbamates with primary of secondary amines to form the corresponding ureas as in Thavonekham, B eL al. Synthesis<br><br>
(1997), JO, p1189; d) reduction of propargyl or homopropargyl alcohols or N-BOC protected primary amines to the corresponding E-allylic or E-homoallylic derivatives by treatment with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride (Red-AI) as in  Denmark, S. E.; Jones, T. K. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47, 4595-4597 or van Benthem, R. A. T. M.; Michels, J. J.; Speckamp, W. N. Synlett (1994), 368-370; e) reduction of alkynes to the corresponding 2-alkene derivatives by treatment hydrogen gas and a Pd catalyst as in Tomassy, B. et. al. Synth. Commun.

The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formulas 1 that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of formula 1 from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br>
Those compounds of formula 1_ that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations.  Examples of such salts include the<br><br>
alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques.   The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula 1_.  Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before.   In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product. Since a single compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moieties, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of the erbB family of oncogenic and protooncogenic protein tyrosine kinases, in particular erbB2, and thus are all adapted to therapeutic use as antiproliferative agents (e.g., anticancer) in mammals, particularly in humans. In particular, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the prevention and treatment of a variety of human hyperproliferative disorders such as malignant and benign tumors of the liver, kidney, bladder, breast, gastric, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, vulval, thyroid, hepatic carcinomas, sarcomas, glioblastomas, head and neck, and other hyperplastic conditions such as benign hyperplasia of the skin (e.g., psoriasis) and benign hyperplasia of the prostate (e.g., BPH). It is, in addition, expected that a compound of the present invention may possess activity against a range of leukemias and lymphoid malignancies. The compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of additipnal disorders in which aberrant expression ligand/receptor interactions or activation or signalling events related to various protein tyrosine kinases, are involved. Such disorders may include those of neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, and blastocoelic nature in which aberrant function, expression, activation or signalling of the erbB tyrosine kinases are involved. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may have therapeutic utility in inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders involving both identified and as yet unidentified tyrosine kinases that are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of formula 1 may be determined by the following procedure.<br><br>
The c-erbB2 kinase assay is similar to that described previously in Schrang et. al. Anal. Biochem. 211,1993, p233-239. Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates are coated by incubation overnight at 37°C with 100 mL per well of 0.25 mg/mL Poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (PGT) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in PBS (phosphate buffered saline).  Excess PGT is removed by aspiration, and the plate is washed three times with wash buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). The kinase reaction is performed in 50 mL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 125 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM ATP, 0.48 mg/mL (24 ng/well) c-erbB2 intracellular domain.   The intracellular domain of the erbB2 tyrosine kinase (amino acids 674-1255) is expressed as a GST fusion protein in Baculovirus and purified by binding to and elution from glutathione coated beads.   The compound in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) is added to give a final DMSO concentration of about 2.5%. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and proceeded for 6 minutes at room temperature, with constant shaking. The kinase reaction is terminated by aspiration of the reaction mixture and subsequent washing with wash buffer (see above). Phosphorylated PGT is measured by 25 minutes of incubation with 50 mL per well HRP-conjugated PY54 (Oncogene Science Inc. Uniondale, NY) antiphosphotyrosine antibody, diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in blocking buffer (3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Antibody is removed by aspiration, and the plate is washed 4 times with wash buffer.  The colorimetric signal is developed by addition of TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD), 50 mL per well, and stopped by the addition of 0.09 M sulfuric acid, 50 mL per well.  Phosphotyrosine is estimated by measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. The signal for controls is typically 0.6-1.2 absorbance units, with essentially no background in wells without the PGT substrate and is proportional to the time of incubation for 10 minutes. Inhibitors were identified by reduction of signal relative to weds without inhibitor and ICso values corresponding to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition are determined.   The compounds exemplified herein which correspond to formula 1 have JC50 values of 
The activity of the compounds of formula 1, in vivo, can be determine by the amount of inhibition of tumor growth by a test compound relative to a control. The tumor growth inhibitory effects of various compounds are measured according to the method of Corbett T.H., et al., Tumor Induction Relationships in Development of Transplantable Cancers of the Colon in Mice for Chemotherapy Assays, with a Note on Carcinogen Structure", Cancer Res., 35, 2434-2439 (1975) and Corbett T.H., et al., "A Mouse Colon-tumor Model for Experimental Therapy", Cancer Chemother. Rep, (Part 2)", 5, 169-186 (1975), with slight modifications. Tumors are induced in the left flank by subcutaneous (sc) injection of 1-5 million log phase cultured tumor cells (murine FRE-ErbB2 cells or human SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells)<br><br>
suspended in 0.1 ml RPMI 1640 medium. After sufficient time has elapsed for the tumors to become palpable (100-150 mm3 in size/5-6 mm in diameter) the test animals (athymic female mice) are treated with test compound (formulated at a concentration of 10 to 15 mg/ml in 5 Gelucire) by the intraperitoneal (ip) or oral (po) route of administration once or twice daily for 7 to 10 consecutive days. In order to determine an anti-tumor effect, the tumor is measured in millimeters with a Vernier caliper across two diameters and the tumor size (mm3) is calculated using the formula: Tumor size (mm3) = (length x [width]2)/2, according to the methods of Geran, R.I., et al. "Protocols for Screening Chemical Agents and Natural Products Against Animal Tumors and Other Biological Systems", Third Edition, Cancer Chemother. Rep., 3,1-104 (1972). Results are expressed as percent inhibition, according to the formula: Inhibition (%) = (TuWcontrol,, - TuWtest/TuWcontrol x 100%. The flank site of tumor implantation provides reproducible dose/response effects for a  variety  of chemotherapeutic agents,   and  the  method  of measurement (tumor diameter) is a reliable method for assessing tumor growth rates.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration.<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-piatin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fiuorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex™ (tamoxifen) or, for<br><br>
example anti-androgens such as Casodex™ (4'-cyano-3-{4-fluorophenylsulphonyl}-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspenston or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical earner or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, aiginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefor, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.<br>
