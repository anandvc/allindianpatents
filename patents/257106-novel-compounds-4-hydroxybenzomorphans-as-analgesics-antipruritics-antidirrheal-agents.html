4-HYDROXYBENZOMORPHANS<br>
Cross Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority from US Provisional Application 60/625,348<br>
filed November 5,2004, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001]   The invention relates to 4-hydroxybcnzomorphans substituted at the 3-position<br>
with carboxamide or thiocarboxamidc. The compounds are useful as analgesics,<br>
anti-diarrhea1 agents, anticonvulsants, antitussivcs, anti-cocaine, and ami-addiction<br>
medications.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[002]   Opiates have been the subject of intense research since the isolation of<br>
morphine in 1805, and thousands of compounds having opiate or opiate-like<br>
activity have been identified. Many opioid receptor-interactive compounds<br>
including those used for producing analgesia (e.g., morphine) and those used for<br>
treating drug addiction (e.g., naltrexone and cyclazocinc) have been employed in<br>
human therapy. Almost all thcrapcutically useful opioids in the bcnzazocinc and<br>
morphinanc classes have a phenolic hydroxyl group (OH) at a position which is<br>
numbered "8" in the numbering system used for 2,6-mcthano-3-bcnzazocincs [e.g.,<br>
cyclazocine and EKC (cthylkctocyclazocinc)] and which is numbered "3" in the<br>
numbering system used for morphinanes (e.g., morphine).<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US20O5/039911<br><br>
[003]   Although the compounds of the present invention do not possess the furan ring<br>
of the morphinans, the morphinan numbering system will be used:<br><br>
2,6-Methauo-3-benzazocines are also known as benzomorphans, and this<br>
terminology will be used interchangeably herein.<br>
[004]   Until the publications of Wentland et al, rBioQrg.Med.ChemLett. 11.623-626<br>
(2001) and BioOrg.Med.Chem.Lett. 11, 1717-1721 (2001)] the uniform experience<br>
in the art of the past seventy years had been that removal or replacement of the<br>
phenolic 3-hydroxy group had led to pharmacologically inactive compounds.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US2005/039911<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[003]   We have now found that when the 3-hydroxyl group is replaced by a number of<br>
small, polar, neutral residues, such as carboxamide and thiocarboxamidegroups, the<br>
adjacent 4-position may be substituted with a hydroxyl to produce compounds with<br>
au extraordinary affinity for the opioid receptor. The compounds of the invention<br>
are therefore useful as analgesics, anti-pruritics, anti-diarrheal agents,<br>
anticonvulsants, antitussives, anorexics, and anti-obesity drugs and as treatments for<br>
hyperalgesia, drug addiction, respiratory depression, dyskinesia, pain (including<br>
neuropathic pain), irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal motility disorders.<br>
[006]   In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds of formula I:<br>
A compound of formula:<br><br>
A   is chosen from -C(=O)NH2 and -C(=S)NH 2;<br>
R2 and R2a are both hydrogen or taken together R2 and R2a are =0;<br>
R3 is chosen from hydrogen, lower alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, benzyl and<br>
hydroxyalkyl;<br>
R4 is chosen from hydrogen, hydroxy, amino, lower alkoxy, C1-C20 alkyl and Ct-<br>
C20 alkyl substituted with hydroxy or carbonyl;<br>
R" is hydrogen;<br>
R12 is chosen from hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkoxy and -NR13R14<br>
or<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US2005/039911<br>
together, R" and R12 form a carboNyl or a vinyl substitueNt;<br>
R13 and R14 are chosen independently from hydrogen and C1 to C7 hydrocarbon.;<br>
and<br>
the dotted line represents an optional double bond.<br>
[007]   In another aspect, the invention relates to methods for treating a disease or<br>
condition by altering a response mediated by an opioid receptor. The method<br>
comprises bringing a compound of formula I into contact with an opioid receptor.<br>
Diseases and conditions that are amenable to therapy with the compounds of the<br>
invention include pain, pruritis, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal<br>
motility disorder, obesity, respiratory depression, convulsions, coughing,<br>
hyperalgesia and drug addiction. Drug addiction, as used herein, includes alcohol,<br>
nicotine, opiate and cocaine addiction. There is evidence in the literature that the<br>
compounds may also be useful as immunosuppressants and antiinflammatories and<br>
for reducing ischemic damage (and cardioprotection), for improving learning and<br>
memory, and for treating urinary incontinence.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[008]   From many years of SAR studies, it is known that the hydroxyl of morphinans<br>
and benzomorphans interacts with a specific site in the opiate receptor. Previous<br>
exploration of the tolerance of this site for functional groups other than phenolic<br>
hydroxyls has almost uniformly resulted in the complete or near-complete loss of<br>
opioid binding.   We have earlier reported (WO 02/36573) that the hydroxyl could<br>
be replaced with one of several bioisosteres.  Although a fairly wide range of<br>
primary and secondary carboxamides, as well as carboxylates, aminomethyl,<br>
hydroxymethyl and even dihydroimidazolyl exhibited binding in the desired range<br>
below 25 nanomolar, optimal activity was observed with a carboxamido,<br>
thiocarboxamido, hydroxyamidino or formamido group.  We have now found that<br>
benzomorphans having a hydroxyl at 4 and the bioisostere "A" at position 3 have a<br>
surprising level of opioid activity.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US2005/039911<br>
[009]   The phenolic 3-hydroxyl functionality of benzomorphans and morphinans can<br>
be chemically converted to an amide by a simple, flexible aud couvenient route<br>
described in WO 02/36573 and in WO 2004/007449, and thiocarboxarnido,<br>
hydroxyamidino and formamido compounds are also easily synthesized as<br>
described in those publications.   Preferred residues A are -Q=O)NI1 2 and<br>
-CO=S)NH2<br>
[010]   It is known in the art that compounds that are µ, δ and Kagonists exhibit<br>
analgesic activity; compounds that are selective µ agonists exhibit aNti-diarrheal<br>
activity and are useful iu treating dyskinesia; µ antagonists aud Kagouists are useful<br>
in treating heroin, cocaine, alcohol and nicotine addiction; Kagouists are also anti-<br>
pnuitic agents aud are useful iu treating hyperalgesia.   In general, the dextrorotatory<br>
isomers of morphinans are useful as antitussives and anticonvulsauts.<br>
[011]   Exemplary opioid receptor ligands having known high affinity are shown iu the<br>
following Chart.<br><br>

opioid receptors.<br>

[013]   The affinities of the compounds of the invention are determined by the method<br>
described in Wentland et al. [BioOrg. Med.Chem. Lett. 9. 183-187 (2000)].<br>
Antinociceptive activity is evaluated by the method described in Jiang et al. [J<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 264. 1021-1027 (1993), page 1022] or by the method<br>
described in Neumeyer et al [J. Med. Chem. 46. 5162 (2003). We have examined<br>
the receptor binding of compounds of formula I in a series of analogs of known<br>
compounds in which the OH is replaced by the A group and a hydroxyl is<br>
introduced adjacent the A group. The data is shown in Tables 1,2,3, and 4. Data<br>
for the standards used are also shown in the tables. The results of these in vitro<br>
tests are accepted by persons of skill in the art as predictive of therapeutic utility in<br>
vivo.<br><br><br><br>

form a subset of heterocycles. Examples of heterocycles that fall within the scope<br>
of the invention include pyrrolidine, pyrazole, pyrrole, indole, quinoline,<br>
isoquinoline,  tetrahydroisoquinoline, benzofuran, benzodioxan, benzodioxole<br>
(commonly referred to as methylenedioxyphenyl, when occurring as a subsubstituent),<br>

phenyl, benzyl, heteroaryl, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or heteroaryloxy.<br>
[021]   Virtually all of the compounds described herein contain one or more<br>
asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other<br>
stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as<br>
(R) or (S)-. The present invention is meant lo include all such possible isomers, as<br>
well as their raceinic and optically pure forms, hi general it has been found that the<br>
levo isomer of morphinans and benzomorphans is the more potent antinociceptive<br>
agent, while the dextro isomer may be useful as an antitussive or antispasmodic<br>
agent. Optically active (R)- and (S)- isoniers may be prepared using chiral synthons<br>
or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques.  When the<br>
compounds described herein contain olefmic double bonds or other centers of<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US2005/039911<br>
geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the<br>
compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric<br>
forms are also intended to be included.<br>
[022]   As used herein, and as would be understood by the person of skill in the medical<br>
art, to which the invention pertains, the recitation of the compound includes<br>
pharrnaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, clathrates, and polymorphs.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts prepared from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids or bases including inorganic acids and<br>
bases and organic acids and bases. Salts may be prepared from pharmaceuticalry<br>
acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for the compounds of the present<br>
invention include acetic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), benzoic, camphorsulfonic,<br>
citric, ethenesulfonic, fumaric, ghuconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric,<br>
isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic,<br>
pantothenic, phosphoric, succiuic, sulruiic, taitaric acid, p-toluenesuifonic, and the<br>
like. The term "solvate" refers to a compound - in this case eszopiclone - in the<br>
solid state, wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal<br>
lattice. A suitable solvent for therapeutic administration is physiologically tolerable<br>
at the dosage administered.  Examples of suitable solvents for therapeutic<br>
administration are ethanol and water. When water is the solvent, the solvate is<br>
referred to as a hydrate.  In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the<br>
compound in the appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or using<br>
an antisolvent. The solvate is typically dried or azeotroped under ambient<br>
conditions.<br>
[023]   The term "preventing" as used herein refers to administering a medicament<br>
beforehand to forestall or obtund an attack.   The person of ordinary skill in the<br>
medical art (to which the present method claims are directed) recognizes that the<br>
term "prevent" is not an absolute term. In the medical art it is understood to refer to<br>
the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/052710	PCT/US2005/039911<br>
seriousness of a condition, and this is the sense intended in applicants' claims. The<br>
term "treating" includes prophylaxis as well as the amelioration of the acute<br>
symptoms. Note that "treating" refers to either or both of the amelioration of<br>
symptoms and the resolution of the underlying conditioa In many of the conditions<br>
of the invention, the administration of the opioid may act not directly on the disease<br>
state, but rather on some pernicious symptom, and the improvement of that<br>
symptom leads to a general and desirable amelioration of the disease state.<br>
[024]   Although this invention is susceptible to embodiment in many different forms,<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention arc shown. It should be understood,<br>
however, that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the<br>
principles of this invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the<br>
embodiments illustrated.  It may be found upon examination that certain members<br>
of the claimed genus are not patentable to the inventors in this application. In this<br>
event, subsequent exclusions of species from the compass of applicants' claims are<br>
to be considered artifacts of patent prosecution and not reflective of the inventors'<br>
concept or description of their invention; the invention encompasses all of the<br>
members of the genus I that are not already in the possession of the public.<br>

[026]   Terminology related to "protecting", "deprotecting" and "protected"<br>
functionalities occurs throughout this application.  Such terminology is well<br>
understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes<br>
which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In that context, a<br>
protecting group refers to a group that is used to mask a functionality during a<br>
process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirable.<br>
The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently<br>
removed to expose the original functionality.  The removal or "deprotection" occurs<br>
after the completion of the reaction or reactions in which the functionality would<br>
interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified, as it is in the processes of<br>
the invention, the person of ordinary skill can readily envision those groups that<br>
would be suitable as "protecting groups"   Suitable groups for that purpose are<br>
discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistry, such as Protective Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis by T.W.Greene [John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991], which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
