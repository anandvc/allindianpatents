Process for the preparation of substituted dimethyl-(3-arvl-butyl)-amine compounds<br>
by means of homogeneous catalysis<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-<br>
butyl)-amine compounds by means of homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl-(3-<br>
aryl-but-3-enyl)-amines.<br>
Dimethyl-(3-aryl-butyl)-amine compounds have proved to be pharmaceutical active<br>
compounds having an excellent analgesic activity and very good tolerability, see<br>
EP-A1- 0 693 475. WO 2005/000788 A1 describes a process for the preparation thereof, in<br>
which in a first stage substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-but-3-enyl)-amine compounds are prepared<br>
by elimination of the tertiary hydroxyl group in substituted 4-dimethylamino-2-aryl-butan-2-ol<br>
compounds. These dimethyl-(3-aryl-but-3-enyl)-amine compounds are then hydrogenated in<br>
a second stage in the presence of metal catalysts. The heterogeneous hydrogenation<br>
proceeds in good yields with adequate activities. As expected, the stereoselectivity is not<br>
very pronounced. According to the examples in WO 2005/000788 A1, if two adjacent<br>
asymmetric C atoms are present diastereomeric ratios of from 2:1 to a maximum of 3:1 can<br>
be obtained for the trans diastereomer: cis diastereomer, that is to say always in favour of<br>
the trans diastereomer. The ratio is established automatically, essentially depends on the<br>
substrate and can be influenced by the choice of reaction conditions to only a small extent.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved and more flexible process for<br>
the preparation of substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-butyl)-amine compounds. It has now been<br>
found that dimethyl-(3-aryl-but-3-enyl)-amine compounds can also be hydrogenated in a<br>
homogeneous phase in the presence of soluble hydrogenation catalysts, and high<br>
conversions and yields can be achieved by this procedure. It has furthermore been found<br>
that the stereoselectivity can be influenced in a targeted manner by the choice of chiral<br>
ligands, and very high optical yields can be achieved. It has also been found that the desired<br>
configuration can be obtained by the choice of ligands if the same substituted dimethyl-{3-<br>
aryl-but-3-enyl)-amine is used as the starting compound.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a substituted dimethyl-(3-<br>
aryl-butyl)-amine compound of the general formula III<br><br><br>

radicals represent a hydrogen atom, corresponding to the following formula MB, or the 2R<br>
enantiomer of the formula IIC<br><br>
The compound of the formula IIC, that is to say 3-[(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pent-3-enyl]-<br>
dimethylamine, in the form of its cis or trans isomer, namely (£)-(2R)-3-[(3-methoxy-phenyl)-<br>
5-metnyl-penl-3-enyl]-Jimelnylamine according to the formula II0.2, and particularly<br>
preferably as (Z)-(2/?)-3-[(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pent-3-enyl]-dimethylamine according<br>
to the formula IIC. 1, or mixtures with a predominant content of the Z isomer, is most<br>
preferably employed.<br><br>
Starting from mixtures, but preferably from one of the isolated enantiomers, the largely<br>
stereoselective preparation of one of the two diastereomers of the formulae III.C1 or III.C2 is<br><br>
possible with the process according to the invention with the choice of appropriately suitable<br>
chiral ligands for the homogeneous catalyst:<br><br>
Therefore, in the process according to the invention<br>
(Z)-(2R)-3-[(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pent-3-enyl]-dimethylamine according to the<br>
formula IIB.1 is preferably employed, and<br>
predominantly the diastereomer (2R, 3/?)-[3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pentyl]-dimethyl-<br>
amine of the formula IIIB.1 is preferably prepared.<br>
The former means that the mixture of the precursors is worked up in accordance with<br>
methods known to the person skilled in the art - described briefly in the following - in order to<br>
provide the 2 isomer for the hydrogenaiion.<br>
The latter means that by appropriate choice of the chiral catalyst, predominantly the<br>
diastereomer (2R, 3R)-[3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pentyl]-dimethyl-amine, that is to say<br>
the trans form, is obtained.<br>
A high degree of stereoselectivity can be defined as meaning that the hydrogenation gives a<br>
product with an enantiomeric excess (abbreviated to "ee") or diastereomeric ratio<br>
(abbreviated to "d.r."). The enantiomeric excess is defined as the ratio (% R - % S) / (% R +<br>
% S), wherein % R represents the percentage content of the R form and % S represents the<br><br>
percentage content of the S form on a chirality centre. Since the compounds of the formulae<br>
IIB.1 and IIB.2 have the R form on the C2 atoms, after the hydrogenation the now chiral<br>
centre on the C3 atom can be present either likewise in the R or S form. Two diastereomers<br>
can therefore be present, namely the (2R, 3R) or trans form and the [2R, 3S) or cis form. The<br>
trans or cis form is as a rule referred to in the following for simplification, the particular<br>
diastereomers previously referred to then being meant.<br>
With the process according to the invention, the hydrogenation can be carried out starting<br>
from a mixture of compounds of the formulae IIC.1 and IIC.2, and nevertheless a<br>
diastereomeric excess of either the trans or the cis form is obtained. For process optimization<br>
reasons, however, it is advantageous to use either the isolated Z or the isolated E isomer as<br>
the starting substance, since isolation of one of the isomers additionally renders possible the<br>
removal of by-products.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the Z isomer is preferably used as the starting educt.<br>
By choice of an appropriate catalyst, starting from the Z isomer a ratio optionally selectively<br>
in favour of the cis or of the trans form of the product can be achieved. In this context, a ratio<br>
of greater than or equal to 70:30, preferably greater than or equal to 75: 25, particularly<br>
Bffiffiri&amp;lY tiff 8lf r tfP ?F eWa' *° 8°; 20. especially preferably greater than or equal to 85 :<br>
15, very particularly preferably greater than or equal to 90:10, in favour of the desired cis or<br>
trans form is defined as good selectivity.<br>
The starting compounds for the process according to the invention in the form of the<br>
.JlJlJIittlw<br>
and lie can be obtained e.g. by dehydration from substituted 4-dimethylamino-2-aryl-t?utan-<br>
2-ol compounds of the general formula I<br><br><br>
If the substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-but-3-enyl)-amine compounds of the general formulae II,<br>
HA, MB and IIC or the substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-butyl)-amine compounds of the general<br>
formula III are obtained in the form of their bases by the process according to the invention,<br>
they can be converted into the corresponding salts, preferably into one of the salts listed<br>
above, by conventional processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Metal complexes of rhodium, iridium and ruthenium, preferably of rhodium and iridium, in<br>
particular of rhodium, with diphosphine ligands are particularly suitable for the process<br>
according to the invention of hydrogenation of the compounds of the general formulae 11,1IA,<br>
IIB and IIC described above with hydrogen by means of homogeneous catalysis.<br>
Little is known of the homogeneous catalysis of homo-allylic amines of the general formula II.<br>
It is all the more surprising that excellent conversions and yields and very high optical yields<br>
of desired stereoisomers can be achieved, in particular when rhodium complexes are used. It<br>
may be advantageous to start from stereochemical^ pure educts of high chemical purity for<br>
this. However, mixtures which have not been worked up and in which Z and £ isomers<br>
equally exist can optionally also be employed.<br>
Possible diphosphine ligands are, for example, diphosphines and analogues such as are to<br>
be found, for example, in current overviews, inter alia in a) H. Brunner, W. Zettlmeier,<br>

5- to 8-membered ring is formed in the metal complex. The two secondary phosphine groups<br>
are bonded terminally to the C atoms of a C2-C8-, preferably C2-C6- and particularly<br>
preferably C2-C4-chain, wherein C atoms of the chain can be replaced by hetero atoms 0, S,<br>
NH and/or N-C,-C4-alkyl and the carbon chain can be part of a monocyclic or polycyclic ring.<br>
Trio ctelQton can contain 2 to 30, preferably two to 20 C atoms and optionally additionally 1<br>
to 4 hetero atoms. The skeleton can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example by Ci-CB-<br><br>
alkyl, Cfl-Ce-alkoxy, CVCValkylthio, C4-C8-cycloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy, benzyloxy,<br>
phenylthio, benzylthio, halogen (preferably F, CI, Br), OH, tr^CrCe-alkylJsilyl, secondary<br>

wherein R' represents C^Ce-alkyl, C4-CB-cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl. The skeleton can be<br>
bivalent radicals of alkanes, heteroalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes,<br>
heterocycloalkanes, heterocycloalkenes, bicycloalkanes, bicycloheteroalkanes,<br>
spirobiscycloalkanes, spirobiscycloheteroalkanes, arylenes, heteroarylenes, bisarylenes,<br>
bisheteroarylenes, metallocenes, such as, for example, ferrocenes, wherein one or both<br>
phosphine groups can be bonded to the cyclopentadienyl ring of a metallocene via a<br>
methylene, Ci-C^-alkylidene, phenylene or -CR"R*-phenylene. R" and R* independently of<br>
one another are, for example, CVCValkyl, (VCValkoxy or phenyl. The free bonds are on one<br>
or both cyclopentadienyl rings. In the cyclic skeletons, the free bonds are preferably in 1,2-<br>
positions and in 1,1-bisaryls in the 6,6'-position.<br>
The secondary phosphine groups can also be bonded to C atoms of the skeleton via an<br>
oxygen atom (these are then phosphinites).<br>
The chirality of the diphosphine ligands can be based on planar isomerism (ferrocenes),<br>
atropisomerism, the presence of asymmetric C atoms and/or P atoms or combinations<br>
thereof,<br>
Examples of skeletons of atropisomers are 1,1'-bisaryls and -bisheteroaryls (bisaryls such<br>
as, for example, biphenyl, binaphthyl or bisthiophenyl) with secondary phosphine groups<br>

Bicyclopentanes, which are commercially obtainable under the trivial name Bicp, are also<br>
known as the base skeleton.<br>
Examples of skeletons having planar chirality are those based on ferrocenes with two<br>
secondary phosphine groups bonded directly to in each case one of the cyclopentadienyl<br>
rings or bonded to a GyGlopentadienyl ring in trio 1,2-position and optionally Glial<br>
substituents on one or both cyclopentadienyl rings. Another example are ferrocenes to which<br>
a secondary phosphine group is bonded in the 1,2-position of the cyclopentadienyl ring and a<br>
further secondary phosphine group is bonded via an asymmetric C atom. A further example<br>
are ferrocenes to which a secondary phosphine group is bonded in the 1,2-position of the<br><br>
cyclopentadienyl ring via an asymmetric C atom and a second secondary phosphine group is<br>
bonded via 1,2-phenylene. Trivial names for such ligands are Josiphos, Walphos, Taniaphos,<br>
Mandyphos and Ferriphos.<br>
Diphosphines having chiral P rings which are substituted in particular in one or both a-<br>
positions to the P atom, for example phospholanes and phosphetanes, are also known. Such<br>
secondary phosphine groups can be bonded in the 1,2-position of benzene, naphthalene,<br>
thiophene, benzothiophene, ethane and ferrocene. Known trivial names are Rophos,<br>
Butiphane and Kephos.<br>
Examples of skeletons having asymmetric C atoms are open-chain with in the 1,2-, 1,3- or<br>
1,4-positions, aliphatic bicyclic ring systems with secondary phosphine groups bonded in the<br>
1,2-positions, or cyclic or heterocyclic five-membered rings with secondary phosphine groups<br>
bonded in the 3,4-positions, optionally via a methylene group. Five-membered rings with a<br>
secondary phosphine group bonded in the 4-position and a secondary phosphinemethyl<br>
group bonded in the 2-position are also known. Trivial names for such ligands are Diop,<br>
Bppm, Bzppm, Depyphos, Norphos and Prophos.<br>
Examples of diphosphines having chiral P atoms are 1,2-bis(secondary phosphine)ethanes<br>

The process according to the invention can be carried out in accordance with the usual<br>
conditions from the prior art with respect to the process parameters for the hydrogenation, that<br>
is to say under the conditions with respect to pressure, temperature, solvents and amounts.<br>
The most important parameters are summarized as follows:<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out at low or elevated temperatures,<br>
for example temperatures of from -20 to 150 °C, preferably from -10 to 100 °C, and<br><br>
particularly preferably from 10 to 80 °C. The optical yields are in general better at lower<br>
temperature that at higher temperatures.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out under normal pressure or<br>
increased pressure. The pressure can be, for example, from 105 to 2x107 Pa (Pascal).<br>
Hydrogenations are preferably carried out under increased pressure.<br>
Catalysts are preferably used in amounts of from 0.00001 to 10 mol%, particularly preferably<br>
0.0001 to 5 mol%, and especially preferably 0.001 to 2 mol%, based on the compound to be<br>
hydrogenated.<br>
The preparation of the ligands and catalysts and the hydrogenation can be carried out<br>
without or in the presence of an inert solvent, it being possible to employ one solvent or<br>
mixtures of solvents. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halohydrocarbons (methylene<br>
chloride, chloroform, di- and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrile,<br>
benzonitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone), carboxylic acid esters and lactones (ethyl or methyl acetate, valerolactone),<br>
N-substituted lactams (N-methylpyrrolidone), carboxylic acid amides (dimethylacetamide,<br>
aimetnylrormamide), acyclic ureas (dimetnylimidazoline), ana sulfoxides ana suliones<br>
(dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, tetramethylene sulfoxide, tetramethylene sulfone) and<br>
alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, trifluoroethanol) and water. The<br>
solvents can be used by themselves or in a mixture of at least two solvents.<br>
It may be advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of metal or ammonium<br>
halides which are soluble in the reaction mixture, for example alkali metal chlorides,<br>
bromides and iodides, or quaternary ammonium halides, such as, for example,<br>
tetrabutylammonium iodide.<br>
It may be particularly expedient, for example if the substrate is employed as a free base, to<br>
carry out the hydrogenation in the presence of acids, for example organic acids, such as<br>
sulfonic acids (methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid), carboxylic acids (formic<br>
acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid), phosphonic acids (meihanephospKonic acid), mineral acids,<br><br>
such as hydrogen halide acids (HCI, HBr, HI), sulfuric acid, phosphorous acid, phosphoric<br>
acid (see, for example, US-A-5,371,256, US-A-5,446,844 and US-A-5,583,241 and EP-A-0<br>
691 949). The acid can be chosen such that a desired salt of the active compound is<br>
obtained directly. The amount of acid can accordingly be up to 1 equivalent or more, for<br>
example an excess of up to 1.5 equivalents, based on the amount of substrate to be<br>
hydrogenated. A suitable range of amounts is 0.01 to 1 equivalent of acid, based on the<br>
amount of substrate to be hydrogenated.<br>
The metal complexes used as catalysts can be added as separately prepared, isolated<br>
compounds, or can preferably also be formed in situ before the reaction and then mixed with<br>
the substrate to be hydrogenated. It may be advantageous additionally to add ligands in the<br>
reaction using isolated metal complexes, or to employ an excess of the ligands in the in situ<br>
preparation. The excess can be, for example, 1 to 10, and preferably 1 to 5 mol per cent,<br>
based on the metal compound used for the preparation.<br>
The process according to the invention is in general carried out by a procedure in which the<br>
catalyst is initially introduced into the reaction vessel and the substrate, optionally reaction<br>
auxiliaries and the gaseous compound to be added on, in the form of hydrogen, are<br>
preferably forced in. The process can be carried out continuously or batchwjse jn various<br>
types of reactor.<br>
The chiral organic compounds which can be prepared according to the invention are active<br>
substance or intermediate products for the preparation of such substances, in particular in<br>
the field of preparation of pharmaceuticals.<br>
Gas chromatography (GO determinations are carried out as follows:<br>

and 5 ml of freshly distilled ethanol are now placed in a 10 ml Schlenk vessel with a magnetic<br>
stirrer and this is exposed six times to a sequence of application of a high vacuum and letting<br>
down with argon. The solution is cooled to 0 °C with the aid of an ice bath and 70 //I<br>
(1.07 mmol) of methanesulfonic acid are then cautiously added. [Rh(nbd)2] BF4 (3.2 mg;<br>
0.0086 mmol) and (S)-Solphos (ligand A, 6.0 mg; 0.0090 mmol) are added to a further 10 ml<br>

temperature is kept at 25 °C and stirring is started. After a reaction time of G7.5 h, the<br>
pressure is let down to normal pressure. A clear solution is obtained. The product is<br>
concentrated to dryness by means of a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of about<br>

Example B2:<br>
The results of Example B1 and further experiments carried out analogously to the process<br>
according to Example B1 are summarized in the following Table 1.<br><br><br>
Ligands: The structures of the ligands used are shown in the following:<br><br><br><br>
Note:<br>
Only little is known of the hydrogenation of homo-allylic amines. Astonishingly, however, it is<br>
possible to prepare the two diastereomers (2R, 3R)- [3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pentyl]-<br>
dimethyl-amine and (2R, 3S)-[3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pentyl]-dim^Y|-arnin§<br>
selectively in a high yleld and optical purity with the homogeneous catalysis by varylng the<br>
catalyst.<br>
As a rule, the use of purified starting substance is advantageous for successful highly<br>
selective hydrogenation. For this, the mixture of (Z)-(2R)-[3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-<br>
pent-3-enyl]-dimethyl-amine, (£)-(2R)-[3-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-methyl-pent-3-enyl]-dimethyl-<br>
amine and further unknown by-products which is obtained from the elimination is subjected<br>
to a hydrochloride precipitation.<br>

dimethyl-amine with a homogeneous rhodium catalyst containing the ligand (S)-A, a purity of<br>
94.1 % and a diastereomeric ratio of the {2R.3R) to the {2R,3S) compound of 11.1:1 is<br>
achieved. Astonishingly, the hydrogenation with a rhodium catalyst which contains the other<br>
enantiomer of the ligand A, namely {R)-A, also give almost the same diastereomeric ratios as<br>
with the ligand (S)-A. It can therefore be assumed that a catalyst with the racemic ligand also<br>
produces good results, which is a considerable economic advantage.<br><br>
If the ligand H is employed, the other diastereomer, the (2R,3S) compound is obtained with a<br>
purity of about 97 % and a diastereomeric ratio of 29:1 (97 %).<br><br><br>
