				<td>SWITCHING COAXIAL JACK<br>
I.  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention pertains to coaxial jacks. More particularly, this invention pertains to a switching coaxial jack which is suitable for use in high frequency transmission rate applications.<br>
2.	Description of the prior art<br>
Switching coaxial jacks are well known.  An example of such is shown in U, S. Patent Nos. 4,749,968 and 5,467,062 both to Burroughs. Another example is shown in U. S. Patent No. 5,246,378 to Seiceanu.<br>
Prior art switching coaxial jacks included two generally solid center conductors disposed in parallel alignment in a grounded electrically conductive housing. A switching assembly is positioned between the two center conductors.<br>
The switching assembly includes a V-shaped spring with a first end biased against a first of the center conductors and with a second end biased against a second of the center conductors. As a result, the center conductors are in normal signal flow communication such that an electrical signal on one of the center conductors passes through the switching assembly to the other center conductor.<br><br>
Such switching coaxial jacks would commonly be used in the telecommunications or video transmission industries.  A rear end of the housing is provided with connectors for semi-permanent or permanent connection to coaxial cables. The front end of the center conductors are provided with jack ports for receiving a plug of predetermined dimensions. Normally, such switching jacks are operated without plugs inserted within the ports.  Accordingly, a signal entering a center conductor from one of the rear connectors passes through the switching assembly and is transmitted out of the jack device through the other rear coaxial connector.<br>
From time to time it is desirable to access the jack in order to tap off the signal or to input a new signal.  To accomplish this, a jack plug with attached coaxial cable is inserted into one of the forward ports.  Upon insertion of the jack plug into the forward port, the jack plug engages the v-shaped sprang causing it to be moved away from the center conductor associated with the port into which the plug is inserted.<br>
By causing the V-shaped spring to be moved away from the center conductor, the center conductor is no longer connected to the other center conductor such that the signal passes directly along the entire length of the center conductor and out the port.  In addition to breaking the connection between the two center conductors of the jack, insertion of the plug also causes the other center conductor to be electrically<br><br>
connected to ground across a resistance so that the desired electrical impedance of the system is ma inc. dined.<br>
With the structure thus described, normal signal flow from rear connector to rear connector passes through the V-shaped spring. There is a substantial length of the center conductors which , extend beyond the V-shaped spring without connection to any ground oc other source of connection.  In the past, these tree lengths of center conductors typically presented little or no problem in the telecommunications industry.  However, with progressively higher transmission frequencies, the free lengths of center conductors can present distortions to signals or otherwise impair signal integrity.<br>
Another problem associated with prior art switching coaxial jacks is admission of dust or other contaminants to the switching assembly.  Such jacks typically have free airflow through the fprward ports into the switching assembly of the jack.<br>
II.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a switching coaxial jack device is disclosed which has an electrically conductive coaxial center conductor extending from a rear portion to a front portion. A second coaxial center conductor is also included within the device.  The rear portion of the first center conductor includes an electrically conductive movable portion which is movable between a<br><br>
first position and a second position. The movable portion is disposed in electrical contact with the second center conductor and electrically disconnected from the front portion of the first center conductor when the movable portion is in the first position. The movable portion is disposed in electrical contact with the front portion and electrically disconnected from the second center conductor when the movable portion is in the second position. An actuator moves the movable portion from the first position to the second position when a coaxial cable is attached to the front portion of the first center conductor.<br>

IV.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the several drawing figures in which identical elements are numbered identically throughout, a description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be provided.<br>
The present invention is a switching coaxial jack device 10.  The jack device 10 includes a diecast, electrically conductive and electrically grounded housing 12. The housing 12 includes a front wall 14/ rear wall 16, and top and bottom walls 18, 20.  The jack device further includes a side wall 22 and a side cover 24 (shown only partially in Fig. 1 so that internal elements can be viewed}.<br>
The housing 12 includes an interior wall 26 which extends parallel to end walls 14, 16 and completely between the side walls 22, 24 and top and bottom walls 18,20.  The internal wall 26 cooperates with a wall segment 26a of cover 24 (Fig. 8) to divide an interior of the housing into a forward port chamber 28 and a rear switching chamber 30.<br>
As shown in the figures, the forward wall 14 of housing 12 includes a first Jack port 32 for receiving a plug 33 of predetermined dimensions. The forward wall 14 further includes a second jack port 34 for receiving such a plug.<br>
Ports 32, 34 are in parallel alignment and each aligned with receptive first and second coaxial connectors 36, 38 disposed on the rear wall 16. Connectors 36, 38 may be any well known connector (such as so-called BNC connectors) or ports for semipermanent or permanent attachment to coaxial cables. The ports 32, 34 include grounding clips 40 for engaging the ground sleeve of an inserted jack plug 33 and for electrically connecting the ground sleeve to the housing 12.<br>
Axially aligned within each of ports 32, 34 are first and second, respectively, forward center conductors 42, 44 to receive a center pin of a jack plug 33 received within ports 32, 34, respectively. The center conductors 42, 44 are maintained in axial alignment within the port* 32, 34 by dielectric inserts 46/ 48.  The dielectric inserts 46, 48 are snugly received within pockets formed in the interior wall 26.<br>
While inserts 46, 48 are shown as solid dielectric cylinders in Figs. 1-8 for ease of illustration, alternative designs can be used. A preferred design will be later described with reference to Figs. 9-25.<br>
First and second rear center conductors 50, 52 are maintained coaxially aligned within rear<br>
connectors 36, 38 and maintained in axial alignment by reason of supporting dielectric inserts 54, 56 contained within the rear wall 16.  First front and rear center conductors 42, 50 cooperate to define a complete first center conductor.  Second front and rear center conductors 44, 52 cooperate to define a complete second center conductor.<br>
It will be noted that the dielectric inserts 46, 48 resist dust flow through the ports 32, 34 and through wall 26 into chamber 30.  Similarly, inserts 54, 56 resist dust flow through the connectors 36, 38 into chamber 30.<br>
The first front center conductor 42 includes a spring portion 42a which extends from insert 46 into chamber 30.  The first rear center conductor 50 includes a spring portion 50a which similarly extends from dielectric insert 54 into chamber 30.  Similarly, each of the center conductors 44, 52 include spring portions 44a, 52a which expend from dielectric inserts 48, 56 into chamber 30.<br>
A switch assembly 60 is contained within chamber 30.  The switch assembly 60 includes a termination clip 62 having first and second termination contacts 64, 66 disposed adjacent free ends of springs 42a, 44a.  Termination clip 62 is connected to the electrically grounded housing 12 across a resistor 68. The clip 62 is carried on a dielectric base 63 inserted within chamber 30.  The base 63 includes dielectric projections 65 which support, springs 42a/ 50a, 44a, and 52a,<br><br>
A V-shaped switching spring 70 is mounted within chamber 30 on a dielectric support post 72 which is integrally formed with and extends from base 63. The spring includes a first spring arm 70a and a second spring arm 70b.  Spring arm 70a is biased toward electrical contact with termination contact 64.  Spring arm 70b is biased toward electrical contact with second termination contact 66.<br>
The spring contacts 42a, 44a of the center conductors 42, 44 are biased toward the termination contacts 64/ 66 respectively. To avoid direct connection of the springs 42a, 44a with the' termination contacts 64, 66, dielectric spacers 80, 82 are positioned between the springs 42a, 44a and termination contacts 64, 66.  Accordingly, in the absence of deflecting forces, the springs 42a, 44a abut against the dielectric spacers 80, 82 (Fig. 1}.  The spacers 80, 82 are formed with and project from base 63.<br>
The springs 5Qa, 52a of rear center<br>
conductors 50, 52 are biased toward the ends 70a, 70b of the V-shaped switching spring 70.  Tn the absence of any forces acting to displace the springs SOa, 52a (Fig. 1), the springs SOa, 52a have their free ends abutting the free ends of the springs 70a/ 70b. Springs SOa, 52a urge springs 70a, 70b from termination contacts 64, 66.  Dielectric support posts 84, 86 (projecting from base 63) prevent over deflection of the springs 70a, 70b and maintain spring pairs SOa, 70a and S2a, 70b in electrical contact.<br><br>
In the drawings, springs 50a, 52a are shown biased against springs 70a, 70b.  In addition to the natural bias of springs 50a, 52a (or as an alternative to such bias), supplemental springs (not shown) could be provided (for example, extending between the sidewalls 18, 20 and levers 90, 92) to urge the levers 90, 92 to the position shown in Fig. 1.<br>
First and second dielectric levers 90, 92 are provided to act as actuators to move the springs 50a, 52a from first position shown in Fig. 1 to a second position (shown with respect to spring 50a in Fig. 4) . The levers 90, 92 include cam ends 90a, 92a positioned adjacent ports 32, 34.  The levers 90, 92 terminate at second ends 90b, 92b within chamber 30.  A cutout 63a is formed in base 63 to provide clearance for movement of lever 90.<br>
The ends 90b, 92b are provided with narrowly spaced apart posts 90b', 92b'. The free ends of the springs 50a, 52a are received in the posts 90b', 92b' for reasons that will became apparent.<br>
Each of tho levers 90, 92 pivot around a common pivot pin 100.  The pivot pin 100 is positioned within a central opening in the wall 26. The levers 90, 92 are sized to substantially fill the opening such that duat cannot easily pass through the opening from chamber 28 into chamber 30. The cam surfaces 90a, 92a are positioned such that the levers are pivoted around pin 100 upon insertion of a plug 33 into ports 32, 34,' respectively.<br><br>
With the structure thus described, the operation of the novel jack of the present invention will now be described with initial reference to Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the jack device 10 is shown with a plug partially inserted into port 32 but not yet engaging cam 90a.  Accordingly, a signal flowing along center conductor 50 passes through spring arm 50a and into the V-shaped spring 70.  The signal is then transmitted out spring arm 52a and center conductor 52.  No portion of the signal passes through springs 42a, 44a or center conductors 42, 44 since the free ends of 42a, 44a are spaced from the movable springs 50a, 52a.  In Fig. 1, springs 50a, 52a are shown in a first position where they are in contact with the v-shaped spring 70 (and hence, in electrical contact with each other) and electrically and physically disconnected from springs 42a, 44a.<br>
Figs. 2-4 show operation of the jack device 10 upon insertion of jack plug 33 into port 32.  While operation with insertion of a jack plug into port 34 is not separately shown, it will be appreciated that it is identical to operation of insertion of the plug 33 into port 32.<br>
As a plug 33 is inserted into port 32, the leading end of the plug sleeve engages the cam surface 90a causing it to be displaced. The displacement of the cam surface 9Qa causes reciprocating displacement of end 90b.  As end 90b moves upwardly in the view of Fig. 2, the post 90b' urges spring 50a away from its biased position. As shown in Fig. 2, spring 50a<br><br>
electrically contacts spring 42a before V-spring end 70a contacts termination contact 64.  Therefore, in this position, there is no grounding contact and springs 50a, 42a and 52a are electrically connected.<br>
As spring 50a moves further upwardly in response to further insertion of plug 33 (Fig. 3), spring end 70a of the V-shaped spring 70 moves into contact with the first termination contact 64.  It will be noted that when spring 70a is in electrical contact with first termination contact 64, the V-shaped spring end 70a and spring 50a are still in electrical and physical contact. Accordingly, contact through termination resistor 68 to ground is made before breakage of the signal path between spring 50a and spring 70.  This sequence of operation is known as "make-before-break" sequencing. A make-before-break switching jack is disclosed in the aforementioned U. S. Pat. No. 4,749,968 to Burroughs.<br>
,  Upon full insertion of the plug 33 into port 32 (Fig. 4), the free end of spring 50a remains in electrical and physical engagement with the free end of spring 42a and forces spring 42a upwardly from dielectric support 80.  Since first termination contact 64 prevents further outward movement of spring 70a, electrical and physical connection between spring 70 and spring 50a is now broken. Further, the downward bias of spring 42a insures the continuous electrical and physical contact between the free ends of springs 42a and 50a.  By capturing the movable spring 50a between the posts 90b', the vibration which the jack 10<br><br>
might be subject to during use is less likely to cause intermittent or other undesirable disconnection between spring 50a and its desired connection with either spring 70a or spring 42a.<br>
As a result, the jack device 10 has the functional equivalence of the prior art jack devices. Mainly, with the absence of a plug into either of ports 32, 34, electrical connection between rear center conductors 50, 52 is maintained. Upon insertion of a jack plug into either of the jack ports, the electrical connection between rear center conductors 50, 52 is broken and a new electrical connection is established from the rear center conductors 50, 52 to the front center conductors 42, 44.  The other rear center conductor is terminated across resistance to an electrical ground.<br>
The jack device has the further advantage that at no time is a substantial length of a center conductor extending off the signal path as was the case with the prior art. Namely, in the absence of a plug within port 32, the center conductor 42 and its associated spring portion 42a are disconnected electrical ].y and physically from rear center conductor 50.  Therefore at high frequency applications, the center conductor 42 and its spring portion 42a are not impairing the signal. Also, at all times, the spring switching chamber 30 is substantially sealed from the exterior of the housing 12. Therefore, passage of dust and other contaminants into the spring chamber 30 is resisted to minimize interference with the electrical<br><br>
connections within the spring chamber 30.  Also, the dielectric supports 80, 82, 84, 86 and pins 90b' , 92b' maintain desired electric contact or separation between the various sprinys at the no plug insertion mode (Fig. 1) and full plug insertion mode [Fig. 4} in the event of vibration forces acting on device 10.<br>
In the foregoing description, the dielectric inserts 46, 48 were shown as being cylindrical bodies which were solid throughout their volume.  While such a design is functional, the present, invention will preferably utilize a novel design of a dielectric support. An example of such a novel support is shown in Figs. 9-15 as dielectric insert 46'.  The insert 46' provides the advantage that substantially all radial surfaces of the insert 46' are set at a non-orthogonal angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the center conduclors 42, 44.<br>
With reference back to Figs. 1 and 8, a cylindrical insert 46 having an axial face which is perpendicular to the axis of the center conductor 42 can result in unsatisfactory return loss in an electromagnetic signal traveling along a coaxial transmission line such as the center conductor 42. Namely, in a coaxial transmission line, an electromagnetic signal travels down the line between the center and outer conductors of a coaxial cable or between the center conductor 42 and the surrounding surfaces of the housing 12 which define an outer conductor surrounding the center conductor 42.  The signal propagates through whatever dielectric medium is<br><br>
present between the center and outer conductors.  For example, in a coaxial cable, the dielectric medium may be a plastic material positioned between the center conductor and an outer ground sleeve. Within a jack, the dielectric medium may be air filling a cavity between the center conductor 42 and opposing surfaces of the housing 12. As a result, different dielectric materials exist along the transmission line.<br>
Every time a signal passes from one<br>
dielectric medium to another, a reflection is produced. An angle of incidence of a signal is the same as the angle of reflection. Therefore, if a signal impinges a dielectric boundary which is perpendicular to the direction of signal travel; a portion of the electromagnetic energy will be reflected straight back in the opposite direction.<br>
with cylindrical configurations such as inserts 46, 48, two surfaces are provided on opposite axial ends of the inserts 46, 48 which are        perpendicular to the direction of signal travel. Therefore, such an insert produces two reflections traveling down the transmission line toward a source.<br>
Other prior art insulators have a combination of a solid dielectric material and air gaps to provide a composite effect of two dielectric coefficients in order to yield a specific impedance. Such insulators may have radially extending vanes extending from a hub. However, the vanes typically present surfaces which are perpendicular to the direction of the signal travel. Also, such insulators which include air gaps may also<br><br>
have a thin membrane of dielectric material which is<br>
perpendicular to the direction of signal travel in<br><br>
order to reasonably seal a device from dust or other contaminants.  Such a membrane usually results in a significant impedance mismatch (i.e., an impedance other than that of the rest of the transmission line) over the small thickness of the membrane. An impedance mismatch is undesirable since such a mismatch is another source of reflection and also presents a signal power loss.<br>
The preferred insert 46' includes a<br>
cylindrical outer wall 111 having a cylindrical outer surface 110 sized to be received within the housing in wall 26 in the same manner as inserts 46, 48.  The insert 46' includes a central hub 112 having an axially extending bore 114 to snugly receive the center conductor 42.  The hub 112 is conical in configuration and is supported by a plurality of radially extended ribs 116 extending between the conical hub 112 and an inner surface of the outer cylindrical wall 111.<br>
A first axial face 121 of the insert 46' is shown in Fig. 9.  A reverse axial face 123 is shown in Fig. 10.  The reverse side 123 further includes a plurality of radially extending ribs 118 supporting the conical hub 112.  The ribs 118 have opposing interior surfaces spaced apart to further define the bore 114. The axial edges of the outer cylindrical body 111 are tapered to provide bevel faces 120. Similarly, the edges of all the ribs 116, 118 are tapered to provided beveled faces 122. Accordingly  substantially none of<br><br>
the surface area of either the first or second axial ends 121, 123 is perpendicular to the axis X-X of the insert 46'.  By substantially, it will be appreciated that sharp knife edges on the tapered face 120/122 cannot be achieved in most molding processes. Accordingly, small blunt areas 124 may result from limitations in manufacturing processes. It is the intent of the present invention that such surface areas be minimized as far as practical through manufacturing processes.<br>
With the embodiment shown in Figures 9-15 the entire axial face 121, 123: of the insert 46r oh both sides of the insert 46' presents a non-orthogonal surface relative to the path of travel of the electromagnetic signal approaching the insert 46'.  Aa a result, the signal is not reflected axially away from the insert 46' thereby reducing back reflection.  While the conical surface 112 can be curved, it would' be preferred that the conical surface be flat since a curved surface can reflect a signal in many different directions.  However, curvature can be acceptable in order to obtain desired impedance matching at every cross section along the axial length of the insert 46'.<br>
Figs. 16-19 show an alternative embodiment for an insert 46' having an outer cylindrical surface 110' and a hub 112' defining a bore 114'. The insert 46' is entirely conical and does not include an outer cylindrical wall nor does it include inner ribs' for reinforcing the structure of insert 46'.<br><br>
The embodiments of Figures 9-18 present a substantially closed surface after a center conductor is  received within the bores  114,   114'.     Such a closed surface can reduce the migration of dust past  the insert  46',   46' ' .<br>
Where prevention of dust migration is not<br>
i<br>
required, the insert can have air cavities which pass<br>
through the axial faces of the insert. Such an insert<br>
is shown in Figs, 20-25 where the insert 46"' includes<br>
an outer cylindrical wall 111'1 with an outer<br>
cylindrical surface 110' with beveled axial ends 120"<br>
and with inwardly protruding ribs 116' each having<br>
beveled axial ends 122' Opposing surfaces of the<br>
ribs 116' define the bore 114' for receiving the<br>
center conductor.	;<br>
In all of the embodiments shown, a non-orthogonal surface opposed the signal path.  The only portion which may be orthogonal is a small portion resulting on blunt edges of the beveled surfaces which can result from manufacturing limitations.<br>
Having described the present invention in a preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that modifications and equivalents of the disclosed concepts may readily occur to one skilled in the art.  For example, while the preferred embodiment is shown with two forward ports 32, 34, it will be appreciated that only one forward port 32 may be required. Also as is conventional, a monitoring'circuit or monitoring jack may be connected to jack 10 to permit non-intrusive monitoring of a signal,  it will be appreciated that<br><br>
such monitoring jacks and connection of monitoring jacks  to switching coaxial jacks  is well know.     An example of such is shown in U.   S.   Pat.   Nog.   4,749,968 and 5,46*7,062 to Burroughs.     Finally,   center conductors 42,   44 are shown solid in the drawings.     For ease of manufacture,   such conductors can be formed of a stamping and rolling process to produce a hollow, tubular conductor.    To resist dust migration,  conductor so formed will preferably have a detent or inwardly protruding tab to present a blocking surface to dust which would otherwise pass through the hollow center conductor.<br><br><br><br>
