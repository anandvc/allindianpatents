(Figure Remove)The aminoketones required for carrying out process (A) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (II). In this formula, Ar1, Ar2 and n each preferably have those meanings already mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as preferred. The aminoketones of the formula (II) are novel.<br>
Aminoketones of the formula (II) can be prepared, for example, by detaching the BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group of the aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) which are also new in a process (A.a) according to the scheme below:<br>
(Figure Remove)The reaction can be carried out, if appropriate, in the presence of a solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane by means of conventional methods for detaching a tert-butyoxycarbonyl amino protecting group, preferably by acidolysis using tri-fluoroacetic acid (cf. for example T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1991). Here, the aminoketones of the formula (II) are preferably isolated as salts of an organic or inorganic Br0nstedt acid, such as, for example, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid or toluenesulphonic acid.<br>
Aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) can be prepared for example by reacting BOC-protected lactams of the formula (IX) with metalated aromatics of the formula (X) at temperatures between 0°C and 80°C according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)In the formula (X), Met represents a monovalent metal radical such as Li, Mgl, MgBr or MgCl<br>
Some of the metalated aromatics of the formula (X) are known, or they can be prepared by known methods such as, for example, lithiation or Grignard reaction, from the corresponding aromatics or halogenoaromatics.<br>
Protected lactams of the formula (IX) are obtained, for example, by BOC-protecting lactams of the formula (XI) by conventional methods such as, for example, metalation with butyllithium and reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (cf. for example T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1991).<br>
Lactams of the formula (XI) can be prepared, for example, starting from o-alkoxylactams of the formula (XII) by two methods. They can be reacted with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as, for example, sulphuric acid, acetic acid or aluminium chloride, and optionally in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, dichloromethane or acetonitrile, according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)Alternatively, they can be reacted with aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, according to the following scheme [cf. Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 25, 255 (1993)]: (Figure Remove)<br>
In the formula (XII) R28 represents methyl or ethyl. In the formula (XIV), Hal represents chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The co-alkoxylactams of the formula (XII) are known and some of them are commercially available. They can be prepared for example from the corresponding unsubstituted imides by cathodic or sodium boranate reduction or from the unsubstituted lactams by anodic oxidation, in each case in the presence of methanol or ethanol (cf. for example J. Org. Chem. 56, 1822 (1991); Synthesis 1980, 315)<br>
The aromatics of the formula (XIII) are benzene derivatives which are generally known or which can be prepared by employing a wide variety of generally known methods of organic chemistry.<br>
The aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) can be prepared in a conventional manner from the corresponding aryl halides and magnesium. Aryl halides are generally known compounds of organic chemistry.<br>
Lactams of the formula (XI) can also be prepared for example by cyclizing substituted o-benzoylcarboxylic acids of the formula (XV) with a reagent prepared from ammonium carbonate and formic acid at boiling point according to the following scheme [cf. Reel. Trav Chim. Bays-Bas 81, 788 (1962)]:<br>
(Figure Remove)The 03-benzoylcarboxylic acids of the formula (XV) required here can be prepared for example by reacting the dicarboxylic anhydrides of the formula (XVI) with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of a Lewis acid such as, for example, aluminium chloride and, if appropriate, in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, benzene, according to the following scheme [cf. Reel. Trav. Chim. Bays-Bas 81, 788 (1962)]:<br>
(Figure Remove)The anhydrides required here are (succinic and glutaric anhydride) or were (adipic anhydride) commercially available [for the preparation of adipic anhydride cf. for example Chem. Ber. 120, 285 (1987)].<br>
If Ar2 in the active compound of the formula (I) according to the invention represents an optionally substituted biphenylyl such as in the formula (I-b) shown further above, the corresponding biphenyllactams of the formula (Xl-a) can be prepared in an advantageous variant of the process described here by reacting, by the method of the process (C) described above and further below, certain<br>
phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) with boronic acids of the formula (VI) according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)The phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) in which X represents bromine or iodine are a subset of the compounds of the formula (XI) whose preparation is described above. The phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) in which X1 represents trifluoromethanesulphonyl can be prepared by the method of process (C) from the corresponding compounds of the formula (XI) in which Ar2 is substituted by<br>
R   - hydroxyl.<br>
The novel aminoketones of the formula (II) can also be prepared, for example, by reducing the nitro group of the nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) which are also novel in a process (A.b) according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)The reduction can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation or other generally known methods for reducing nitro groups (cf, for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 11/1, 394-409 and Volume 4/1 c, 490-506). Preference is given to the methods where the reaction is carried out in acid medium, since the aminoketones of the formula (II) are preferably isolated as salts.<br>
Nitroketones of the forumula (XVIII) can be prepared for example by condensing co-chloroalkylphenylketones of the formula (XXI) in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, another lower aliphatic alcohol or tetrahydrofuran and in the presence of an acid binding agent such as, for example, sodium hydride or an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably of the corresponding alcohol employed as diluent, according to the scheme below:<br>
(Figure Remove)The co-chloroalkylphenylketones of the formula (XXI) are commercially available, known or can be prepared by employing known methods, for example by Friedel-Crafts-acylation of corresponding benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) (see below) with 3-chloropropionyl chloride, 4-chlorobutyryl chloride or 5-chloro-pentanoic acid chloride.<br>
The nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) are known or can be prepared in a known manner, such as, for example, by nitration of the corresponding toluenes in the side chain or reaction of the corresponding benzyl halides with silver nitrite [cf. for example J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 6269 (1955); J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 2681 (1964); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 10/1, 46-57 (halogen substitution), Volume E16, 145-154 (both methods)]. The toluenes or benzyl halides required are generally known compounds of organic chemistry.<br>
The nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) in which n equals 1 (XVIII-a) can be prepared for example by Michael addition of nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) to phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, ethanol or another lower aliphatic alcohol and in the presence of an acid binder such as, for example, preferably an alkali metal alkoxide of the corresponding alcohol employed as diluent, according to the scheme below (cf for example J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 10/1, 199-206):<br>
(Figure Remove)The phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) can be prepared for example by eliminating hydrogen chloride from P-chloropropiophenones of the formula (XXI-a) which are obtainable for example by Friedel-Crafts acylation of the corresponding benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) with 3-chloropropionyl chloride, in the presence of an acid binder such as, for example, potassium acetate and in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, according to the following scheme [cf. for example J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955)]:<br>
(Figure Remove)Some of the benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) are commercially available or known, or they can be prepared by generally known methods of the chemistry of aromatics.<br>
The phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) can also be prepared by reacting O-methyl methylbenzohydroxamates of the formula (XXIII) with vinylmagnesium bromide according to the following scheme: <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Some of the O-methyl  methylbenzohydroxamates  of the formula (XXIII)  are known ("Weinreb  amides"),  or they can be prepared by known methods, for<br>
example from the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives [cf. for example Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 3815 (1981)].<br>
Since some of the phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) are unstable they are, in a preferred variant for preparing the nitroketones of the formula (XVIII-a), directly reacted with nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX).<br>
Nitroketones of the formula (XVIII-a) can also be prepared by adding enamines of methyl phenyl ketones of the formula (XXVI) to a-nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) and hydrolyzing the reaction product under acidic conditions according to the following scheme:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)In the formulae (XXIV), (XXV) and (XXVI), R29 and R30 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a cyclic amino radical such as, for example, 1-pyrrolidino, 1-piperidino or 4-morpholino.<br>
In most instances, the addition proceeds in a [4+2]-cycloaddition to afford 1,2-oxazine N-oxide derivatives of the formula (XXV) which can be isolated, and the reaction is, if appropriate, carried out in the presence of an apolar diluent such as, for example, diethyl ether, at, for example, -80° to +20°C. The hydrolysis is carried out using for example aqueous mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, if appropriate in the presence of methanol or ethanol [cf. for example Helv. Chim.<br><br>
Acta 68, 162 (1985); Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989)]. In many instances it is advantageous first to open the ring to afford compounds of the formula (XXIV) by simple dissolution of the 1,2-oxazine N-oxide derivative in methanol or ethanol, since the undesirable Nef reaction which yields the corresponding diketo compound will otherwise take place as a competing reaction [cf. for example Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989)].<br>
Some of the enamines of the formula (XXVI) are known, or they can be prepared for example from appropriately substituted acetophenones and cyclic amines by standard procedures (for example Org. Syntheses Vol. 58, 56, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). Some of the acetophenones required are commercially available or known, or they can be prepared by known methods of the chemistry of aromatics.<br>
Some of the nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) are known, or they can be prepared for example by formylation of the nitromethylbezenes of the formula (XIX) given above (cf. for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume E16, 215).<br>
The novel aminoketones of the formula (II) can also be prepared for example by hydrolyzing imines of the formula (XXVIII) in a process (A.c) according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)The hydrolysis can be carried out by generally known methods for example using aqueous hydrochloric acid. Here, the aminoketones of the formula (II) are also preferably isolated as their salts, for example as hydrochlorides, as described further above.<br>
The imines of the formula (XXVIII) in which n equals 1 (XXVIII-a) can be prepared for example by carrying out Michael additions of N-diphenylmethylene-<br>
benzylamines of the formula (XXIX) to phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)The addition is carried out in the presence of an acid binder and in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, acetonitrile or dichloromethane and, if appropriate, in the presence of a reaction auxiliary, for example at room temperature. A preferred acid binder is aqueous alkali such as 50% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as, for example, triethylbenzylammonium chloride as reaction auxiliary [cf. for example Synth. Commun. 17, 211 (1987)].<br>
The preparation of the phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) is described further above. The N-dimethylmethylenebenzylamines of the formula (XXIX) are obtained for example by reacting the corresponding benzylamines with benzo-phenone (cf. for example Tetrahedron Lett. 1978, 2641). The benzylamines required for this purpose are known, or they can be prepared by known methods such as, for example, aminolysis of the corresponding benzyl halides (see above).<br>
The cyclic O-methanesulphonyl oximes required for carrying out process (B) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (III). In this formula Ar" and n both preferably have those meanings already mentioned in connection with the description of cyclic amines of the formula (I) as preferred. The O-methanesulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) are novel.<br>
The O-methylsulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) can be prepared for example by first converting cyclic a-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) by generally known methods into their oximes of the formula (XXX) and then reacting these with methanesulphonyl chloride by the method of the mesylation of alcohols according to the following scheme: (Figure Remove)<br>
Cyclic oc-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) can be prepared for example by epoxidizing 1-arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) by conventional methods, for example using m-chloroperbenzoic acid, to give oxiranes of the formula (XXXII), and then isomerizing these by acid work-up according to the following scheme [cf. for example Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974)]:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)Of course it is also possible to isomerize oxiranes of the formula (XXXII) obtained by different routes to cyclic oc-aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI), for example by shaking a solution in chloroform with 20% strength sulphuric acid.<br>
1-arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) can be prepared for example by reacting the aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) described further above with ketones of the formula (XXXV) under usual Grignard conditions and dehydrating the cyclic benzyl alcohols of the formula (XXXIV), for example obtained in this manner, according to the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove)The dehydration can be carried out for example by dissolving the alcohol in a little of a polar solvent such as hexane and stirring with half-concentrated sulphuric acid, for example at 0° to 20°C [cf. for example Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974)].<br>
The ketones of the formula (XXXV), cyclobutanone, cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone are all commercially available.<br>
The aryl Grignard compounds further required for carrying out process (B) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (IV). In this formula, Ar1 preferably has that meaning already mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as preferred.<br>

The cyclic imines of the formula (V) required for carrying out process (C) according to the invention are, in as far as X1 represents bromine or iodine, subsets of the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention and can be prepared for example by process (A) or (B). If X represents tri-fluoromethanesulphonyl, the compounds of the formula (V-a) can be prepared by reaction of hydroxyl compounds of the formula (I-f) which can also be prepared by process (A) or (B) using trifluoromethanesulphonyl chloride or trifluoro-methanesulphonic anhydride in the presence of an acid binder such as, for example, pyridine and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent according to the following scheme: (Figure Remove)<br>
The boronic acids also required for carrying out process (C) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (VI). In this formula, R4"1 preferably has that meaning already mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I-b) as preferred.<br>

The cyclic imines of the formula (I-d) required for carrying out process (D) according to the invention are subsets of the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention and can be prepared for example by processes (A) to (C).<br>
The compounds further required for carrying out process (D) according to the invention are defined by formula (VII). In this formula, R15, R16, G, p, q and r each preferably have those meanings already mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as preferred. Ab represents a conventional leaving group such as, for example, halogen, in particular chlorine or bromine; alkylsulphonyloxy, in particular methylsulphonyloxy; or optionally substituted arenesulphonyloxy, in particular phenylsulphonyloxy, p-chloro-sulphonyloxy or p-tolylsulphonyloxy.<br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which attack agricultural livestock, such as, for<br><br><br>
example, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, honey bees, other domestic animals, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds, aquarium fish, and so-called experimental animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea-pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, it is intended to reduce deaths and decreased performances (in meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like), so that more economical and simpler animal keeping is made possible by using the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
In the veterinary sector, the active compounds according to the invention are used in a known manner by enteral administration, for example in the form of tablets, capsules, drinks, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through method, suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by means of injections (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal administration, for example in the form of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring-on and spotting-on, washing, dusting, and with the aid of shaped articles which comprise active compound, such as collars, ear tags, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When administered to livestock, poultry, domestic animals and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, flowables) which comprise the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, either directly or after dilution by a factor of 100 to 10 000, or they may be used in the form of a chemical bath.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have a potent insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned by way of preferred examples but without any limitation:<br>

Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials, such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber products, and paint.<br>
The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by insects are wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example, construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or in joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if appropriate<br><br>
desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wooden materials comprise the active compound according to the invention at a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined upon use in each case by test series. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-like solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 280°C, essence of turpentine and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloro-naphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br><br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility and having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ether, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, poly condensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The artificial resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binder. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br><br>
All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethyl enebenzo-phenone.<br>
Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can additionally comprise other insecticides and, if appropriate, additionally one or more fungicides.<br>
Suitable additional components which may be admixed are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in that document are expressly incorporated into the present application.<br>

Example F<br>
Blow fly larvae test / development-inhibitory action<br>
Test animals: All larval stages of Lucilia cuprina (OP resistant)<br>
[Pupae and adults (without contact with the active compound)]<br>
Solvent:	35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether<br>
To prepare a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are mixed with 7 parts by weight of the abovementioned solvent-emulsifier mixture, and the resulting emulsion concentrate is diluted with water to the concentration desired in each case.<br>
For each concentration, 30 to 50 larvae are transferred to horse meat (1 cm3) located in glass tubes, and 500 ul of the test dilution are pipetted onto the meat. The glass tubes are placed into plastic beakers whose bottom is covered with sea sand and kept in a controiled-environment cabinet (26°C + 1.5°C, 70% relative humidity ± 10%). The activity is checked after 24 hours and 48 hours (larvicidal action). After the larvae have left (about 72 h), the glass tubes are removed and perforated plastic lids are placed on the beakers. After V/i times the development period (hatching of the control flies), the hatched flies and the pupae/puparia are counted.<br>
The criterion for the action is death in the treated larvae after 48 h (larvicidal effect), or inhibition of adults hatching from the pupae or inhibition of pupation. The criterion for the in-vitro action of a substance is the inhibition of fly development or a standstill of development prior to the adult stage. 100% larvicidal activity means that all the larvae have died after 48 hours. 100% development-inhibitory activity means that no adult flies have hatched.<br>
In this test, for example the compound of Preparation Example 1-1 exhibited an activity of 100% at an exemplary active compound concentration of 1000 ppm.<br>
Example G<br>
Ecdysis test on polyphargus tick nymphs<br>
Test animals:  Amblyomma variegatium, ticks which have sucked themselves full<br>
Solvent:	35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether<br>
To prepare a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are mixed with 7 parts of the abovementioned solvent-emulsifier mixture, and the resulting emulsion concentrate is diluted with water to the concentration desired in each case.<br>
10 Nymphs which have sucked themselves full are immersed for 1 minute into the preparation of active compound to be tested. The animals are transferred to Petri dishes (0 9.5 cm) equipped with filter paper discs and covered. After the nymphs have remained in a controlled-environment cabinet for 4 weeks, the ecdysis rate is determined.<br>
100% means that all the animals have undergone normal ecdysis; 0% means that none of the animals have undergone normal ecdysis.<br>
In this test, for example the compounds of Preparation Examples 1-1 and 1-2 showed an activity of in each case 100% at an exemplary active compound concentration of 1000 ppm.<br><br>
