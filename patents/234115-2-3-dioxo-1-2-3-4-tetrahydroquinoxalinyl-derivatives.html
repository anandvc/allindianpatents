Compounds of formula I having acidic groups may form salts with bases. Compounds of formula I having basic groups may also form acid addition salts and, where in addition at least one acidic group is present, may also form internal salts.<br>
Salts of compounds of formula I with bases are, for example, salts thereof with pharma-ceutically acceptable bases, such as non-toxic metal salts derived from metals of groups la, lb, Ha and lib, for example alkali metal salts, especially sodium or potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, especially calcium or magnesium salts, and also ammonium salts with ammonia or organic amines or quaternary ammonium bases, such as optionally C-hydroxyl-ated aliphatic amines, especially mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamines, for example methyl-, ethyl- or diethyl-amine, mono-, di- or tri-(hydroxy-lower alkyl)amines, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine or 2-hydroxy-tert-butyl-<br><br>

Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I are, for example, the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof with suitable mineral acids, such as hydrohalic acids, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, for example hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, hydrogen sulfates or phosphates, salts with suitable carboxylic acids, such as optionally hydroxylated lower alkanoic acids, for example acetic acid, glycolic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid or pivalic acid, optionally hydroxylated and/or oxo-substituted lower alkanedicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, pyruvic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, and also with aromatic, heteroaromatic or araliphatic carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, nicotinic acid or mandelic acid, and salts with suitable aliphatic or aromatic sulfonic acids or N-substituted sulfamic acids, for example methanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates or N-cyclohexylsulfamates (cyclamates).<br>
Also included are both total and partial salts, that is to say salts with 1, 2 or 3, preferably 2, equivalents of base per mole of acid of formula I, or salts with 1, 2 or 3 equivalents, prefer¬ably 1 equivalent, of acid per mole of base of formula I.<br>
For the purposes of isolation or purification it is also possible to use pharmaceutical^ unacceptable salts. Only the pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic salts are used therapeutically and they are therefore preferred.<br>
The compounds of formula I have valuable pharmacological properties. They exhibit a high degree of binding affinity for AMPA receptors, kainate receptors and/or glycine binding sites of NMDA receptors. The affinity for the mentioned receptors is global or selective according to the structure. Selected compounds of formula I exhibit especially a strong affinity for AMPA and/or kainate binding sites and a less strong affinity for glycine binding sites of the NMDA receptor.<br>
The binding capacity of the compounds prepared according to the invention and their salts can be demonstrated in vitro radiographically in brain membranes of rats (mice, rats) with<br><br>
reference to the displacement of [3H]-AMPA, [3H]-kainate or [3H]-DCKA (5,7-dichloro-kynurenic acid), the concentration required for 50 % displacement (IC^) being determined for several concentrations.<br>
In order to determine the binding affinity for AM PA receptors it is possible to use, for example, the radio receptor assay of Honore T., Lauridsen J. and Krogsgaard-Larsen according to J. Neurochem. 38,173-178, in which compounds of formula I exhibit IC^, values of approximately 0.05 to approximately 5 \iM. For N-(2,3-dioxo-7-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydroquinoxalin-5-ylmethyl)-2-amino-2-thiazoline hydrobromide, for example, an IC^ value of 0.3 micromol/litre was determined. The binding affinity for kainate receptors can be measured, for example, by means of the radio receptor assay of Simon J.R., Contrera J.F. and Kuhn M.J., J. Neurochem 26, 141-147, in which compounds of formula I exhibit IC^, values of from approximately 0.5 to approximately 5 nM.<br>
The binding capacity of compounds of formula I to glycine binding sites of the NMDA receptor can be determined, for example, in the radio receptor assay according to Baron M.B, Siegel B.W. era/., Eur. J. Pharmacol., Molec. Pharmacol. Section 206. pages 149-154 (1991) and Canton T., Doble A. et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 44, pages 812-816 (1992) on rat cortex and rat hippocampus membranes. In that experimental procedure the IC50 of compounds of formula I lies in the range of from approximately 0.005 to approximately 5 n,M. For N-(7-bromo-2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-ylmethyl)-3-thienyl-acetamide, for example, an IC50 value of 0.007 micromol/litre was determined.<br>
By virtue of those properties, the compounds of formula I have pronounced anticonvulsive properties which are determined in vivo, for example in mice, by reference to their pronounced protective action with respect to convulsions triggered by electric shock or metrazole, it being possible to use, for example, the well established electric shock mouse model or the mouse model for metrazole-induced convulsions according to Schmutz et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 342, 61-66 (1990).<br>
The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof are accordingly excellently suitable for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of pathological conditions that are responsive to blocking of one or more of the mentioned<br><br>
sub-types of excitatory amino acid receptors, for example neurodegenerative disorders, such as those arising from stroke, hypoglycaemia, anoxia or symptoms of cerebral paralysis; ischaemic brain disorders, such as cerebral ischaemia, cerebral ischaemia in cardiosurgery or cardiac arrest, perinatal asphyxia, epileptic fits, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and cerebral trauma, and also symptoms of poisoning resulting from neurotoxins or drug abuse; and ischaemic disorders of the eyes; vascular and muscular spasms, such as migraine or local or general spasticity; convulsions, such as epilepsy; and anxiety states and pain, such as trigeminal neuralgias.<br>
Structurally simpler compounds of formula I wherein the radical Ri or R2 that is other than R5 is, for example, amino-lower alkyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl, can also be used as inter¬mediates in the preparation of compounds of formula I having a side chain of more complex structure, by substituting the former in customary manner, for example by the use of customary nucleophilic substitution procedures, at the amino or hydroxy group.<br>

The hard gelatin capsules may comprise the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and if desired stabilisers. In soft capsules the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, it likewise being possible to add stabilisers.<br>
Suitable rectally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient with a suppository base material. Suitable suppository base materials are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols. It is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which comprise a combination of the active ingredient with a base material. Suitable base materials are, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
For parenteral administration there are suitable, especially, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example in the form of a water-soluble salt, and also suspensions of the active ingredient, such as corresponding oily injection suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or aqueous injection suspensions which comprise viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and optionally also stabilisers.<br>
The dose of the active ingredient depends upon the species of warm-blooded animal, age and individual condition and also upon the mode of administration. In a normal case the approximate daily dose for oral administration to a patient weighing about 75 kg is estimated to be from approximately 10 mg to approximately 500 mg.<br>

A solution of 0.15 g (0.39 mmol) of 3-(2,3-dimethoxy-7-nitro-quinoxalin-5-yl)-3-methoxy-<br>
carbonylamino-propionic acid in 5 ml of 33 % HBr/HOAc is heated for 16 hours at 70°C.<br>
After cooling, the grey suspension is diluted with tert-butyl methyl ether and filtered with<br>
suction. The title compound is obtained in the form of a grey powder.<br>
1H-NMR (DMSO-D6): 5 12.41 (s, 1H), 12.4-11.8 (br, 1H), 8.7-8.3 (br, NH3+), 5.4-5.28 (m,<br>
2H), 3.16-2.96 (m, 2H); FAB-MS: [M+1]+ 295.<br><br>
The starting material can be prepared as follows:<br>
a)	Methvl f1-(2,3-dimethoxy-7-nitro-Quinoxalin-5-vn-but-3-enyllcarbamate SV-2560<br>
1.26 ml of BF3.OEt2 are added all at once to a suspension, stirred at 0°C, of 2.63 g<br>
(10 mmol) of 2,3-dimethoxy-7-nitro-quinoxaline-5-carbaldehyde, 0.75 g (10 mmol) of methyl carbamate and 1.2 g (10.5 mmol) of allyltrimethylsilane in 30 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at 25°C, and is then poured onto 10 % aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and diluted with brine and ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated off, dried and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Crystallisation of the crude product yields the title compound in the form of almost colourless crystals; m.p. = 135-136°C. TLC (EtOAc/hexane 1:3): R, = 0.17.<br>
b)	3-(2.3-Dimethoxy-7-nitro-quinoxalin-5-yl)-3-methoxycarbonylamino-propionicacid<br>
A mixture of 0.31 g (0.85 mmol) of methyl [1-(2,3-dimethoxy-7-nitro-quinoxalin-5-yl)-but-3-enyljcarbamate, 0.733 g (3.42 mmol) of sodium iodate (Nal04) and 0.01 g of ruthenium oxide (Ru02) in 5 ml of acetonitrile, 5 ml of carbon tetrachloride and 5 ml of water is stirred vigorously for 4 hours at 25°C. The mixture is then filtered off over High-Flow® and then washed with ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase is washed in succession with 1N hydrochloric acid and brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is again mixed with 0.50 g of sodium iodate, 0.005 g of ruthenium oxide in a mixture of 5 ml of water, 5 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of carbon tetrachloride and is stirred vigorously for a further 1 hour. The mixture is filtered over High-Flow®, then washed with ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase is separated off, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Crystallisation of the crude product from tert-butyl methyl ether yields the title compound in the form of grey crystals. TLC (EtOAc/HOAc 98:2): R, = 0.52.<br>
1H-NMR (CDCI3): 5 8.61 (d, J=3Hz, 1H), 8.32 (d, J=3Hz, 1H), 6.36-6.28 (m, 1H), 6.02-5.88 (m, 1H), 4.23 (s, 3H), 4.19 (s, 3H), 3.68 (s, 3H), 3.18-3.09 (m, 2H).<br><br>

Example 81: For the preparation of a sterile dry substance for injection, comprising 5 mg of 7-bromo-2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-ylmethoxyacetic acid or of a salt, for example the sodium salt, thereof, 5 mg of one of the compounds of formula I mentioned in the preceding Examples as active ingredient are dissolved in 1 ml of an aqueous solution comprising 20 mg of mannitol and 20 % cyclodextrins as solubiliser. The solution is sterile-<br><br>
filtered and introduced under aseptic conditions into a 2 ml ampoule, is deep-frozen and lyophilised. Before use, the lyophilisate is dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water or 1 ml of physiological saline solution. The solution is administered intramuscularly or intravenously. This formulation can also be introduced into double-chamber injection ampoules.<br>
Example 82: 10 000 film-coated tablets, each comprising 100 mg of 7-bromo-2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-ylmethoxyacetic acid or a salt, for example the sodium salt, thereof, can be prepared as follows:<br>
active ingredient	1000g<br>
corn starch	680 g<br>
colloidal silicic acid	200 g<br>
magnesium stearate	20 g<br>
stearic acid	50 g<br>
sodium carboxymethyl starch	250 g<br>
water	q. s.<br>
A mixture of one of the compounds of formula I mentioned in the preceding Examples as active ingredient, 50 g of corn starch and the colloidal silicic acid is processed with starch paste consisting of 250 g of corn starch and 2.2 kg of demineralised water to form a moist mass. The moist mass is forced through a sieve having a mesh size of 3 mm and is dried at 45°C for 30 minutes in a fluidized bed dryer. The dried granules are pressed through a sieve having a mesh size of 1 mm, are mixed with a previously sieved mixture (1 mm sieve) of 330 g of corn starch, the magnesium stearate, the stearic acid and the sodium carboxymethyl starch, and are compressed to form slightly biconvex tablets.<br>
