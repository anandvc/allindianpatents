COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
TITLE: Novel Anti-fungal agents<br>
APPLICANTS: FDC Limited, a Company incorporated under the Company"s Act 1956, and having their registered office at B, 8 MIDC Industrial Estate, Waluj, Maharashtra 431 135,India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:The invention relates to a novel anti-fungal compound which are derivatives of l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl&gt;-2-(2",4"-difluorophenyl)-3-(2-a%l-benzimdidazol-l-yi)propan -ol useful in the treatment of fungal infections in animals, including humans and as agricultural fungicides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
In the past two decades the frequency and types of life-threatening fungal infections have increased dramatically in immuno-compromised patients. Several factors have contributed to this rise such as the expansion of severely ill and or immuno-compromised patient populations with HTV infection, with chemotherapy induced neutropenia, and receiving immunosuppressive therapy; more invasive medical procedures, such as extensive surgery and the use of prosthetic devices and vascular catheters; treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics or glucocorticosteroids; and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis<br>
This problem of increased fungal infections is accentuated by the emergence of fungal strains which are resistant to currently used antifungal agents. Major opportunistic fungal pathogens include Candida albicans, Aspergillus, Fusurian spp. Other species of Candida such as C. krusei, C tropicalis, C. glabrata are major causative agents of candidiasis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a leading cause of mortality in bone marrow transplant recipients. HIV-infected patients are particularly susceptible to mucosal candidiasis, cryptcoccal meningitis.<br>
Fluconazol is the preferred broad spectrum anti-fungal agent used in treatment of fungal infections. In recent times resistance of Candida albicans the most common cause of mucosal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, after long-term suppressive therapy, to azoles, particularly fluconazole, is a cause of increasing concern. Resistance to fluconazole in other Candida species and in Cryptococcus neoformans has also been reported. Also, fluconazole appears to be less active against the two emerging Candida species, C glabratta and C. krusei. Infection with Aspergillus, although not common, is frequently Ufe-threatening, and fluconazole has only moderate activity against this fungi<br>
This has necessitated the need for new antifungal agents with broad spectrum of antifungal activity, which this invention seeks to provide.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY;<br><br>
(I)<br>
In its main aspect, the invention consists of a novel anti-fungal compound being a derivative of l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-(2",4"-difluorophenyl)-3-(2-all^l-benzimdidazol-l-yl)propan -ol of formula (I), and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br><br>
When R is Imidazolyl (n), R2 and R3 are hydrogen and Rl is selected from among aroyl, p-chloroaroyl, phenyl hydroxy methine or p-chloro phenyl hydroxy methine, and when Rl is n-butyl , R2 and R3 are chlorine. In the alternative , when R is a benzimadazolyl (HI) , R5 is hydrogen and R4 is selected from among methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, 2-oxoprop-l-yl, n-propyl, methoxy methyl, propen-1-yi, phenyl, p-chlorophenyl, p-toluyl, benzyl, 4-pyridyl, p-methoxy phenyl, 3-pyridyl, o-methoxy phenyl, styryl, 2-cyano methyl, p-hyrdroxy phenyl, p-amino phenyl, p-toluyl sulfonyl memyl or p-(t-butyl) phenyl group .

Antifungal activity of these compounds also extends to Aspergillus and Fusarium. The activity seen in compound of Formula (1) as against these strains suggests mat it exhibits broad spectrum antifungal activity<br><br><br>
I<br><br>
For human use, the antifungal agents of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be administered alone, but is generally administered in an admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which is selected depending on the intended route of administration and standard medical practice. Thus it can be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules or ovules or they can be injected intradermally, intramuscularly or subcutaneously.<br>
For parenteral administration the compound is in the form of aqueous solution, along with other excipients. Alternatively, the antifungal compound of formula (I) can be administered in the form of supository or can be applied topically in the form of lotion, gel solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder.<br><br>

Appendix C. Interpretive Guidelines for In Vitro Susceptibility Testing of Candida Species<br><br>
Shown are the breakpoints (µg/mL) for Candida species against the indicated agents. If MICs are measured using a scale that yields results felling between categories, the next higher category is implied. Thus, an isolate with a fluconazole MIC of 12.5 mcg/mL would be placed in the S-DDcategory.f<br>
Footnotes<br>
* For fluconazole, these guidelines are based substantially on experience with mucosal infections, but are consistent with the limited information for invasive infections due to Candida spp. Isolates of C. krusei are assumed to be intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, and their MICs should not be interpreted using this scale. It is also pertinent that the 8-mcg/mL upper boundary for the susceptible range of fluconazole is not known with certainty—the data would permit selection of either 4 or 8 mcg/mL for this cut-off. f For itraconazole, the data are based entirely on experience with mucosal infections, and data supporting breakpoints for invasive infections due to Candida spp. are not available. % Susceptibility is dependent on achieving the maximal possible blood level. For fluconazole, doses of 400 mg/day or more may be required in adults with normal renal function and body habitus. For itraconazole, measures to assure adequate drug absorption and plasma itraconazole concentrations of &gt;0.5 mcg/mL may be required for optimal response.<br>
§ The susceptibility of these isolates is not certain, and the available data do not permit them to be clearly categorized as either "susceptible" or "resistant. "<br>
f These breakpoints were adopted at a meeting of the subcommittee held June 1, 1996 in Reston, VA. These breakpoints are considered tentative for one year and are open for comments.<br><br><br>
