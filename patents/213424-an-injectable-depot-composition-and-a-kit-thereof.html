RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/399.832. filed on July 31,2002;<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to a depot composition<br>
that can be injected into a desired location within a patient's body to form an implant, which provides for controlled, sustained release of a beneficial agent. More particularly, the present invention pertains to depot compositions of a beneficial agent and a polymer matrix, the polymer matrix having a plurality of bioerodible, biocompatible polymers wherein each polymer of the plurality of polymers has a specified weight average molecular weight; and the polymer matrix has a broad molecular weight distribution, preferably a multi-modal distribution, of the plurality of polymers. The polymer matrix promotes shear thinning and improved injectability of the depot composition. The present invention also relates to a method of using the depot composition to administer a beneficial agent to a patient.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Biodegradable polymers have been used for many years in<br>
medical applications. Illustrative devices composed of the biodegradable polymers include sutures, surgical clips, staples, implants, and drug delivery systems. The   ajority of these biodegradable polymers have been based  upon glycoiide, lactide, caprolactone, and copolymers thereof.<br>
[0003]	The biodegradable polymers can be thermoplastic materials,<br>
meaning that they can be heated and formed into various shapes such as fibers, clips, stap s, pins, films, etc. Alternatively, they can be thermosetting materials formed  y crosslinking reactions, which lead to high-molecular-weight<br>
1<br><br>
materials that do not melt or form flowable liquids at high temperatures. Although thermoplastic and thermosetting biodegradable polymers have many useful biomedical applications, there are several important limitations to their use in the bodies of various animals including humans, animals, birds, fish, and reptiles.<br>
[0004]	Solid implant drug delivery systems containing a drug<br>
incorporated in thermoplastic or thermosetting biodegradable polymers have been widely used successfully. Such implants have to be inserted into the body through an incision which is sometimes larger than desired by the medical profession and occasionally lead to a reluctance of the patients to accept such an implant or drug delivery system. The following patents U.S. Patent Nos. 5,456,679; 5,336,057; 5,308,348; 5,279,608; 5,234,693; 5,234,692; 5,209,746; 5,151,093; 5,137,727; 5,112,614; 5,085,866; 5,059,423; 5,057,318; 4,865,845; 4,008,719; 3,987,790 and 3,797,492 are believed to be representative of such drug delivery systems and are incorporated herein by reference. These patents disclose reservoir devices, osmotic delivery devices and pulsatile delivery devices for delivering beneficial agents.<br>
[0005]	Injecting drug delivery systems as small particles, microspheres,<br>
or microcapsules avoids the incision needed to implant drug delivery systems. However, these materials do not always satisfy the demand for a biodegradable implant. These materials are particulate in nature, do not form a continuous film or solid implant with the structural integrity needed for certain prostheses, the particles tend to aggregate and thus their behavior is hard to predict. When inserted into certain body cavities such as a mouth, a periodontal pocket, the eye, or the vagina where there is considerable fluid flow, these small particles, microspheres, or microcapsules are poorly retained because of their small size and dk continuous nature. Further, if there are complications, removal of microcapsule or small-particle systems from the body without extensive surgical interve tion is considerably more difficult than with solid implants. Additionally, manufacture, storage and injectability of<br>
2<br><br>
microspheres or microcapsules prepared from these polymers and containing drugs for release into the body present problems.<br>
[0006]	The art has developed various drug delivery systems in response<br>
to the aforementioned challenges. The following patents U.S. Patent Nos. 5,990,194; 5,780,044; 5,733,950; 5,620,700; 5,599,552; 5,556,905 5,278,201; 5,242,910 and 4,938,763; and PCT publication WO 98/27962 are believed to be representative and are incorporated herein by reference. These patents disclose polymer compositions for injectable implants using solvents and/or plasticizers.<br>
[0007]	Previously described polymer formulations for injectable implants<br>
have used solvent/plasticizers that are very or relatively soluble in aqueous body fluids to promote rapid solidification of the polymer at the implant site and promote diffusion of drug from the implant. Rapid migration of water into such polymeric implants utilizing water soluble polymer solvents when the implants are placed in the body and exposed to aqueous body fluids presents a serious problem. The rapid water uptake often results in implants having pore structures that are non-homogeneous in size and shape. Typically, the surface pores take on a finger-like pore structure extending for as much as one-third of a millimeter or more from the implant surface into the implant, and such finger-like pores are open at the surface of the implant to the environment of use. The internal pores tend to be smaller and less accessible to the fluids present in the environment of use. The rapid water uptake characteristic often results in uncontrolled release of beneficial agent that is manifested by an initial, rapid release of beneficial agent from the polymer formulation, corresponding to a "burst" of beneficial agent being released from the implant. The burst often results in a substantial portion of the beneficial agent, if not all, being released in a very short time, e.g., hours or 1-2 days. Such an effect can be unacceptable, particularly in those circumstances where a controlled delivery is desired, i.e., delivery of beneficial agent in a controlled manner over a period of greater than two weeks or up to a month, or where there is a narrow therapeutic window and release of excess beneficial agent can result in<br>
3<br><br>
adverse consequences to the subject being treated, or where it is necessary to mimic the naturally-occurring daily profile of beneficial agents, such as hormones and the like, in the body of the subject being treated.<br>
[0008]	Accordingly, when such devices are implanted, the finger-like<br>
pores allow very rapid uptake of aqueous body fluids into the interior of the implant with consequent immediate and rapid dissolution of significant quantities of beneficial agent and unimpeded diffusion of beneficial agent into the environment of use, producing the burst effect discussed above.<br>
[0009]	Furthermore, rapid water uptake can result in premature polymer<br>
precipitation such that a hardened implant or one with a hardened skin is produced. The inner pores and much of the interior of the polymer containing beneficial agent are shut off from contact with the body fluids and a significant reduction in the release of beneficial agent can result over a not insignificant period of time ("lag time"). That lag time is undesirable from the standpoint of presenting a controlled, sustained release of beneficial agent to the subject being treated. What one observes/then, is a burst of beneficial agent being released in a short time period immediately after implantation, a lag time in which no or very little beneficial agent is being released, and subsequently continued delivery of beneficial agent (assuming beneficial agent remains after the burst) until the supply of beneficial agent is exhausted.<br>
[00010]        Various approaches to control burst and modulate and stabilize the delivery of the beneficial agent have been described. The following patents U.S. Patent Nos. 6,130,200; 5,990,194; 5,780,044; 5,733,950; 5,656,297; 5,654,010; 4,985,404 and 4,853,218 and PCT publication WO 98/27962 are believed to be representative and are incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding some success, those methods have not been entirely satisfactory for the large number of beneficial agents that would be effectively delivered by implants.<br>
4<br><br>
[00011]        An additional problem encountered with prior solvent-based depot formulations is that the viscosity of the injectabie formulation is relatively high, particularly when higher molecular weight polymers are used, and the injection force needed to introduce the formulation into a patient's body is therefore high as well (see, e.g. U.S. Patent No. 6,130,200). However, the high viscosity of the gel is desirable to maintain the integrity of the depot after injection and during the dispensing period and also facilitate desired suspension characteristics of the beneficial agent in the gel.<br>
[00012]        To address this problem, those working in the field have employed various methods to reduce overall viscosity of the formulation, such as the use of lower molecular weight polymers, a lower polymer to solvent ratio, and agents that provide viscosity reduction. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,733,950,5,780,044, and 5,990,194 to Dunn et al. International application WO 98/27962 and co-pending, co-owned U.S. provisional applications, serial numbers 60/336,254 and 60/336,307, describe the formation of a thixotrojsic gel formulation that provides for shear thinning and more acceptable injectability of the gel, such that lower injection forces are needed to expel the gel from a syringe and also lower the likelihood of substantial discomfort to a subject by use of smaller needles than would otherwise be required.<br>
[00013]        Notwithstanding some success, the previously described systems have not been entirely satisfactory. For example, these approaches can result in drug particle settling; a higher initial release burst; relatively large amounts of emulsifying agent, e.g., about one-third of the total weight of the formulation; manufacturing problems related to solvent volatility; denaturation of proteins and peptide drugs depending on the solvent/emulsifying agent used, and the like. Additionally, the requirement that the bioerodible polymer have a low molecular weight is quite restrictive from a manufacturing standpoint.<br>
[00014]        It has been discovered that in certain systems, depot compositions with a polymer matrix, having a plurality of bioerodible, biocompatible polymers wherein each polymer of the plurality of polymers has a specified weight average molecular weight; the polymer matrix having a<br>
5<br><br><br>
broad molecular weight distribution of the plurality of polymers (e.g. a multi-modal distribution of high, medium and low molecular weight polymers), dissolved in a suitable polymer solvent result in depot compositions exhibiting substantially significantly improved shear thinning and further reduced injection force as compared to previously described depot gel formulations. The depot compositions exhibit non-Newtonian flow, i.e., shear thinning at a lower shear rate as compared to previously disclosed depot formulations having a narrower range of molecular weight distribution (e.g., uni-modal distribution of medium molecular weight polymers), thus resulting in depot compositions that are readily injectable through needles having a gauge that when used is not unduly uncomfortable to a subject.<br>
Summary of the Invention	<br>
[00015]        The present invention is directed to the aforementioned needs in the art, and provides an injectable depot composition that exhibits improved shear thinning behavior and thereby enables further reduced injection force and use of a small diameter (e.g., 16 gauge and higher) needle. In particular, the injectable depot composition increases the shear thinning behavior and composition homogeneity of the depot composition, without resulting in settling of the beneficial agent. The composition provides sustained release of a beneficial agent while limiting any initial burst effect, and offers increased composition flexibility with regard to the polymer/solvent ratio and the molecular weight of the bioerodible polymer. The depot compositions of the present invention reduce the injection force significantly without compromising the in vivo release profile of the beneficial agent.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Overview and Definitions:<br>
[00046]        The present invention is directed to an injectable depot composition that serves as an implanted sustained release beneficial agent delivery system after injection into a patient's body. In particular, the present invention pertains to an injectable depot composition that exhibits improved shear thinning behavior and a low injection force. The present invention also relates to a method of using the injectable depot composition to administer a beneficial agent to a patient.<br>
[00047]        The injectable depot composition is a gel formed from a polymer matrix comprising a plurality of bioerodible, biocompatible polymers wherein each polymer of the plurality of polymers has a specified weight average molecular weight; the polymer matrix having a broad molecular weight distribution of the plurality of polymers; a solvent having a miscibility in water of less than or equal to 7% at 25Â°C; and a beneficial agent. In a preferred<br>
15<br><br>
embodiment, the polymer matrix has a multi-modal molecular weight distribution of the plurality of polymers; wherein a first of the plurality of polymers is a low molecular weight (LMW) polymer; a second of the plurality of polymers is a high molecular weight (HMW) polymer; and optionally a third of the plurality of polymers is a medium molecular weight (MMW),polymer. In additional embodiments, the polymer matrix has a bi-modal molecular weight distribution of the plurality of polymers, the plurality polymers being selected from a low molecular weight (LMW) polymer, a high molecular weight (HMW) polymer, and a medium molecular weight (MMW) polymer.<br>
[00048]        In some embodiments, pore formers and solubility modulators of the beneficial agent may be added to the implant systems to provide desired release profiles from the implant systems, along with typical pharmaceutical excipients and other additives that do not change the beneficial aspects of the present invention.<br>
[00049]         Previously described depot gel formulations having a narrower range of molecular weight distribution, generally a uni-modal molecular weight distribution, exhibit a Newtonian flow. These formulations are highly viscous and maintain their viscosity at high shear, thus making it difficult to inject these formulations. It has been discovered that a depot gel composition having a broader range of molecular weight distribution, as described herein, exhibits a . non-Newtonian flow (shear thinning) at a lower shear rate than the previously described depot gel formulations. In particular, when these depot gel compositions are subjected to a high shear, such as during injection, the viscosity of the composition decreases considerably, resulting in improved injectability. Further, these depot gel compositions promote shear thinning behavior, and significantly decrease injection force without affecting the controlled, sustained release rate of the beneficial agent, and without the undesirable burst effect. As described in greater detail herein, the injection force is reduced approximately 30-40% as compared to the previously described depot compositions (see e.g., Examples 11 and 13-18, and Figures 1 and 3-12, as described in greater detail hereinafter).<br>
16<br><br>
[00050]        The composition provides sustained release of the beneficial agent by restricting water migration from the aqueous environment surrounding the implant system, thus delivering the beneficial agent over a prolonged period of time. Water uptake is controlled by virtue of the water-immiscible solvents. Because the polymer of the composition is bioerodible, the implant system does not have to be surgically removed after beneficial agent is depleted from the Implant.<br>
[00051]        Generally, the compositions of the invention are gel-like and form a substantially homogeneous non-porous structure throughout the implant upon implantation and during drug delivery, even as it hardens. Furthermore, while the polymer gel implant will slowly harden when subjected to an aqueous environment, the hardened implant may maintain a rubbery (non-rigid) composition with the glass transition temperature Tg being below 37Â°C.<br>
[00052]        Additionally, the high molecular weight (HMW) polymers within the polymer matrix of the depot composition generally harden faster when the solvent exits the depot, potentially accelerating the formation of a beneficial agent-diffusion barrier. Thus depot gel compositions provide a controlled, sustained release of the beneficial agent from the depot composition, without the undesirable burst effect.<br>
[00053]        The preferred compositions herein allow beneficial agent to be loaded into the interior of the polymer at levels that are above that required to saturate the beneficial agent in water, thereby facilitating zero order release of beneficial agent. Additionally, the preferred compositions may provide viscous gels that have a glass transition temperature that is less than 37Â°C, such that the gel remains non-rigid fora period of time after implantation of 24 hours or more.<br>

RG503 with LMW PLGA, and has a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of<br>
2.75.	:<br>
[00078]        The terms "a single-modal polymer matrix" and "a uni-modal polymer matrix" are used interchangeably and refer to a polymer matrix having a uni-modal and narrow distribution of molecular masses. Generally, a uni-modal polymer matrix has a single peak on a molecular weight distribution plot (frequency on the abscissa and molecular weight on the ordinate) (see, e.g.,<br>
22<br><br>
Figure 2). For example, uni-modal polymer matrix comprises a polymer such as (like MMW PLGA RG502); and has a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 1.90.<br>
[00079]        The term "low molecular weight (LMW) polymer" refers to biocompatible, bioerodible polymers having a weight average molecular weight ranging from about 3000 to about 10,000; preferably from about 3000 to about 9,000; more preferably from about 4000 to about 8,000; and more preferably the low molecular weight polymer has a molecular weight of about 7000, about 6000, about 5000, about 4000 and about 3000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>

[00083]        The term "thixotropic" is used in its conventional sense to refer to a gel composition that can liquefy or at least exhibit a decrease in apparent viscosity upon application of mechanical force such as shear force. The extent . of the reduction is in part a function of the shear rate of the gel when subjected to the shearing force. When the shearing force is removed, the viscosity of the thixotropic gel returns to a viscosity at or near that which it displayed prior to being subjected to the shearing force. Accordingly, a thixotropic gel may be subjected to a shearing force when injected from a syringe which temporarily reduces its viscosity during the injection process. When the injection process is completed, the shearing force is removed and the gel returns very near to its previous state.<br>
[00084]        A "thixotropic agent" as used herein is one that increases the thixotropy of the composition in which it is contained, promoting shear thinning and enabling use of reduced injection force.<br>
[00085]        The following definitions apply to the molecular structures<br>
described herein:	,.<br>
[00086] As used herein, the phrase "having the formula" or "having the structure" is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term "comprising" is commonly used.<br>
[00087]        The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a saturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyf, and the like, as well as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkyl groups herein contain 1 to about 12 carbon atoms. The term "lower alkyl" intends an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. "Substituted alkyl" refers to<br>
24<br><br>
alkyl substituted with one or more substituent groups, and the terms "heteroatom-containing alkyl" and "heteroalkyl" refer to alkyl in'which at least one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom. If not otherwise indicated, the terms "alkyl" and "lower alkyl" include linear, branched, cyclic, unsubstituted, substituted, and/or heteroatom-containing alkyl or lower alkyl.<br>
[00088]        The term "aryl" as used herein, and unless otherwise specified, refers to an aromatic substituent containing a single aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings that are fused together, linked covalently, or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. Preferred aryl groups contain one aromatic ring or two fused or linked aromatic rings, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, diphenylether, diphenylamine, benzophenone, and the like, and most preferred aryl groups are monocydic. "Substituted aryl" refers to an aryl moiety substituted with one or more substituent groups, and the terms "heteroatom-containing aryl" and "heteroaryl" refer to aryl in which at least one carbon atom is replaced with a heteroatom. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "aryl" includes heteroaryl, substituted aryl, and substituted heteroaryl groups.<br>
[00089]        The term "aralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group, wherein alkyl and aryl are as defined above. The term "heteroaralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted with a heteroaryl group. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "aralkyl" includes heteroaralkyl and substituted aralkyl o groups as well as unsubstituted aralkyl groups. Generally, the term "aralkyl" herein refers to an aryl-substituted lower alkyl group, preferably a phenyl substituted lower alkyl group such as benzyl, phenethyl, 1-phenylpropyl, 2-phenylpropyl, and the like.<br>
[00090]        The term "heteroatom-containing" as in a "heteroatom-containing hydrocarbyl group" refers to a molecule or molecular fragment in which one or more carbon atoms is replaced with an atom other than carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus or silicon. Similarly, the term "heterocyclic" refers to a cyclic substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the term "heteroaryl" refers to an aryl substituent that is heteroatom-containing, and the like.<br>
25<br><br>
[00091]        By "substituted" as in "substituted alkyl," "substituted aryl" and the like, as alluded to in some of the aforementioned definitions, is meant that in the alkyl or aryl moiety, respectively, at least one hydrogen atom bound to a carbon atom is replaced with one or more non-interfering substituents such as hydroxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like.<br>
I. Iniectable Depot Compositions:<br>
[00092]        As described previously, injectable depot compositions for delivery of beneficial agents over a prolonged period of time may be formed as viscous gels prior to injection of the depot into a subject. The viscous gel supports dispersed beneficial agent to provide appropriate delivery profiles, which include those having low initial burst, of the beneficial agent as the beneficial agent is released from the depot overtime.<br>
[00093]        Typically, the viscous gel will be injected from a standard hypodermic syringe that has been pre-filled with the beneficial agent-viscous gel composition to form the depot. It is often preferred that injections take place using the smallest size needle (i.e., smallest diameter) to reduce discomfort to the subject when the injection takes place through the skin and into subcutaneous tissue. It is desirable to be able to inject gels through needles ranging from 16 gauge and higher, preferably 20 gauge and higher, more preferably 22 gauge and higher, even more preferably 24 gauge and higher. With highly viscous gels, i.e., gels having a viscosity of about 200 poise or greater, injection forces to dispense the gel from a syringe having a needle in the 20-30 gauge range may be so high as to make the injection difficult or reasonably impossible when done manually. At the same time, the high viscosity of the gel is desirable to maintain the integrity of the depot after injection and during the dispensing period and also facilitate desired suspension characteristics of the beneficial agent in the gel.<br>
26<br><br>
[00094]        The depot gel composition described herein exhibits reduced viscosity when subjected to shear force. The extent of the reduction is in part a function of the shear rate of the gel when subjected to the shearing force, the molecular weight of the polymer and the polydispersity of the polymer matrix. When the shearing force is removed, the viscosity of the depot gel composition returns to a viscosity at or near that which it displayed prior to being subjected to the shearing force. Accordingly, the depot gel composition may be subjected to a shearing force when injected from a syringe which temporarily reduces its viscosity during the injection process. When the injection process is completed, the shearing force is removed and the gel returns very near to its previous state.<br>

[000106] The solvent will be added to polymer in amounts described below, to provide implantable or injectable viscous gels. Again, the combination LMW, MMW and HMW and the solvent described herein enables much wider range of<br>
31<br><br><br>
polymer/solvent ratios than obtainable previously; and provides a depot composition having improved injectability.<br>
B. Solvents:<br>
[000107]      The injectable depot composition of the invention contains a water-immiscible solvent having a miscibility in water that is less than 7 wt.% at . 25Â°C, in addition to the bioerodible polymer, the thixotropic agent and the beneficial agent. The solvent must be biocompatible, should form a gel, preferably a viscous gel with the polymer, and restrict water uptake into the implant. Suitable solvents will substantially restrict the uptake of water by the implant and, as noted above, may be characterized as immiscible in water, i.e., having a solubility or miscibility in water of at most 7% by weight. Preferably, the water solubility of the aromatic alcohol is 5 wt.% or less, more preferably 3 wt.% or less, and even more preferably 1 wt.% or less. Most preferably, the solubility of the aromatic alcohol in water is equal to or less than 0.5 weight, percent. In preferred embodiments, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of an aromatic alcohol, esters of aromatic acids, aromatic ketones, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[000108]      Water miscibility may be determined experimentally as follows: Water (1-5 g) is placed in a tared clear container at a controlled temperature, about 25"C, and weighed, and a candidate solvent is added dropwise. The solution is swirled to observe phase separation. When the saturation point appears to be reached, as determined by observation of phase separation, the solution is allowed to stand overnight and is re-checked the following day. If the solution is still saturated, as determined by observation of phase separation, then the percent (w/w) of solvent added is determined. Otherwise more solvent is added and the process repeated. Solubility or miscibility is determined by dividing the total weight of solvent added by the final weight of the solv nt/water mixture. When solvent mixtures are used, they are pre-mixed prior to  dding to the water.<br>
32<br><br>
[000109]     The aromatic alcohol has the structural formula (I)<br><br>
wherein Ar is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl group, n is zero or 1, and L is a linking moiety. Preferably, Ar is a monocyclic aryl br heteroaryl group, optionally substituted with one or more noninterfering substituents such as hydroxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like. More preferably, Ar is an unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered aryl or heteroaryl group such as phenyl, cyclopentadienyl, pyridinyl, pyrimadinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyf, imidazolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, or the like. The subscript nn" is zero or 1, meaning that the linking moiety L may or may not be present. Preferably, n is 1 and L is generally a lower alkylene linkage such as methyiene or ethylene, wherein the linkage may include heteroatoms such as O, N or S. Most preferably, Ar is phenyl, n is 1, and L is methyiene, such that the aromatic alcohol is benzyl alcohol.<br>
[000110]      The aromatic acid ester or ketone must be biocompatible, should form a viscous gel with the polymer, and restrict water uptake into the implant. Like the aromatic alcohol, suitable aromatic acid esters and ketones will substantially restrict the uptake of water by the implant and, as noted above, may be characterized as immiscible in water, i.e., having a solubility or miscibility in water of at most 7% by weight. Preferably, the water solubility of the solvent alcohol is 5 wt.% or less, more preferably 3 wt.% or less, and even more preferably 1 wt.% or less. Most preferably, the solubility of the solvent in water is equal to or less than 0.5 weight percent.<br>
[000111]      The aromatic acid ester or ketone may be selected from the lower aikyl and aralkyl esters of aromatic acids, and aryl and aralkyl ketones. Generally, although not necessarily, the aromatic acid esters and ketones will respectively have the structural formula (II) or (III)<br>
33<br><br><br>
[000112]      In the ester of formula (II), R1 is substituted or unsubstituted aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl, preferably substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl, more preferably monocyclic or bicyclic aryl or heteroaryl optionally substituted with one or more non-interfering substituents such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like, still more preferably 5- or 6-membered aryl or heteroaryl such as phenyl, cyclopentadienyl, pyridinyl, pyrimadinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyi, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, thiazolyl, or isothiazolyl, and most preferably 5- or 6-membered aryl. R2 is hydrocarbyl or heteroatom-substituted hydrocarbyl, typically lower alkyl or substituted or unsubstituted aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl, preferably lower alkyl or substituted or unsubstituted araikyl or heteroaraikyl, more preferably lower alkyl or monocyclic or bicyclic aralkyl or heteroaralkyl optionally substituted with one or more non-interfering substituents such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, thio, amino, halo, and the like, still more preferably lower alkyl or 5- or 6-membered aralkyl or heteroaralkyl, and most preferably lower alkyl or 5- or 6-membered aryl optionally substituted with one or more additional ester groups having the structure -0-(CO)-R1. Most I referred esters are benzoic acid and phthalic acid derivatives.<br>
[000113]      In the ketone of formula (III), R3 and R4 may be selected from any of the R1 and R2 groups identified above.<br>
[000114]      Art recognized benzoic acid derivatives from which solvents having the requisite solubility may be selected include, without limitation: 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol dibenzoate, diethylene glycol dibenzoate, dipropylene<br>
34<br><br>
glycol dibenzoate, polypropylene glycol dibenzoate, propylene glycol dibenzoate, diethylene glycol benzoate and dipropylene glycol benzoate blend, polyethylene glycol (200) dibenzoate, Isodecyl benzoate, neopentyl glycol dibenzoate, glyceryl tribenzoate, pentaerylthritol tetrabenzoate, cumylphenyl benzoate, trimethyl pentanediol dibenzoate.<br>
[000115]      Art recognized phthallc acid derivatives from which solvents having the requisite solubility may be selected include: Alkyl benzyl phthalate, bis-cumyl-pnenyl isophthalate, dibutoxyethyl phthalate, dimetrfyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, butyl octyl phthalate, diisoheptyl phthalate, butyl octyl phthalate, dilsononyl phthalate, nonyl undecyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, di-isooctyl phthalate, dicapryl phthalate, mixed alcohol phthalate, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, linear heptyl, nonyl, phthalate, linear heptyl, nonyl, undecyl phthalate, linear nonyl phthalate, linear nonyl undecyl phthalate, linear dinonyl, didecyl phthalate (diisodecyl phthalate), diundecyl phthalate, ditridecyl phthalate, undecyldodecyl phthalate, decyltridecyl phthalate, blend (50/50) of dioctyl and didecyl phthalates, butyl benzyl phthalate, and dicyclohexyl phthalate.<br>
[000116]      Most preferred solvents are derivatives of benzoic acid and include, but are not limited to, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, n-propyl benzoate, isopropyl benzoate, butyl benzoate, isobutyl benzoate, sec-butyl benzoate, tert-butyl benzoate, isoamyl benzoate and benzyl benzoate, with benzyl benzoate being most especially preferred.<br>
[000117]      The composition may also include, in addition to the water-immiscible solvent(s), one or more additional miscible solvents ("component solvents"), provided that any such additional solvent is other than a lower alkanol. Component solvents compatible and miscible with the primary solvent(s) may have a higher miscibility with water and the resulting mixtures may still exhibit significant restriction of water uptake into the implant. Such mixtures will be referred to as "component solvent mixtures." Useful component solvent mixtures may exhibit solubilities in water greater than the<br>
35<br><br>
primary solvents themselves, typically between 0.1 weight percent and up to and including 50 weight percent, preferably up to and including 30 weight, percent, and most preferably up to an including 10 weight percent, without detrimentally affecting the restriction of water uptake exhibited by the implants of the invention.<br>
[000118]      Component solvents useful in component solvent mixtures are those solvents that are miscible with the primary solvent or solvent mixture, and include, but are not limited, to triacetin, diacetin, tributyrin, triethyl citrate, ' tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylglycerides, triethyl phosphate, diethyl phthalate, diethyl tartrate, mineral oil, polybutene, silicone fluid, glycerin, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, octanol, ethyl lactate, propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, butyrolactone, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolldone, 2-pyrrolidone, glycerol formal, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, decylmethylsulfoxide, oleic acid, and 1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[000119]      The solvent or solvent mixture is capable of dissolving the polymer to form a viscous gel that can maintain particles of the beneficial agent dissolved or dispersed and isolated from the environment of use prior to release. The compositions of the present invention provide implants having a low burst index. Water uptake is controlled by the use of a solvent or component solvent mixture that solublizes or plasticizes the polymer but substantially restricts uptake of water into implant.<br>
[000120]      The solvent or solvent mixture is typically present in an amount of from about 95 to about 5% by weight, preferably about 75 to about 15% by weight, and most preferably about 65% to about 20% by weight of the viscous gel. In an especially preferred embodiment, the solvent is selected from an aromatic alcohol, lower alkyl and aralkyl esters of benzoic acid. Presently, the most preferred solvents are benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate and the lower alkyl<br>
36<br><br>
esters of benzoic acid. In certain embodiments, the solvent comprises a mixture of the aromatic alcohol (formula I), aromatic acid ester (formula II) and ketone (formula III). Generally, the weight ratio of the aromatic alcohol to the ester or ketone is in the range of about 1 % to about 99%, preferably in the range of about 10% to about 90%, often in the range of about 20% to about 80%.<br>
[000121]      The viscous gel formed by mixing the polymer and the solvent typically exhibits a viscosity of from about 200 to about 200,00(5 poise, preferably from about 2,000 to about 50,000 poise, often from about 1,000 to about 50,000 poise measured at a 0.1 sec*1 shear rate and 25Â°C using a Haake Rheometer at about 1-2 days after mixing is completed. Mixing the polymer with the solvent can be achieved with conventional low shear equipment such as a Ross double planetary mixer for from about 10 minutes to about 1 hour, although shorter and longer periods may be chosen by one skilled in the art depending on the particular physical characteristics of the composition being prepared. Since it is often desirable to administer the implant as an injectable composition, a countervailing consideration when forming implants that are viscous gels is that the polymer, solvent and beneficial agent composition have sufficiently low viscosity in order to permit it to be forced through a small diameter, e.g., 16 gauge and higher, preferably 20 gauge and higher, more preferably 22 gauge and higher, even more preferably 24 gauge and higher o gauge needle. If necessary, adjustment of viscosity of the gel for injection can be accomplished with emulsifying agents as described herein. Yet, such compositions should have adequate dimensional stability so as to remain localized and be able to be removed if necessary. The particular gel or gel-like compositions of the present invention satisfy such requirements.<br>
C. Beneficial Agents:<br>
[000122]      The beneficial agent can be any physiologically or pharmacologically active substance or substances optionally in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and additional ingredients such as antioxidants, stabilizing agents, permeation enhancers, etc. that do not<br>
37<br><br>
substantially adversely affect the advantageous results that can be attained by the present invention. The beneficial agent may be any of the agents which are known to be delivered to the body of a human or an animal and that are preferentially soluble in water rather than in the polymer-dissolving solvent.

[000127]      The present invention also finds application with chemotherapeutic agents for the local application of such agents to avoid or minimize systemic side effects. Gels of the present invention containing chemotherapeutic agents may be injected directly into the tumor tissue for sustained delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent over time. In some cases, particularly after resection of the tumor, the gel may be implanted directly into<br>
42<br><br>
the resulting cavity or may be applied to the remaining tissue as a coating. In cases in which the gel is implanted after surgery, it is possible to utilize gels having higher viscosities since they do not have to pass through a small diameter needle. Representative chemotherapeutic agents that may be delivered in accordance with the practice of the present invention include, for example, carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, BCNU, vincristine, camptothecin, etopside, cytokines, ribozymes, interferons, oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide sequences that inhibit translation or transcription of tumor genes, functional derivatives of the foregoing, and generally known chemotherapeutic agents such as those described in U.S. Patent 5,651,986. The present application has particular utility in the sustained delivery of water soluble chemotherapeutic agents, such as for example cisplatin and carboplatin and the water soluble derivatives of paclitaxel. Those characteristics of the invention that minimize the burst effect are particularly advantageous in the administration of water soluble beneficial agents of all kinds, but particularly' those compounds that are clinically useful and effective but may have adverse side effects.<br>
[000128]      To the extent not mentioned above, the beneficial agents described in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 5,242,910 can also be used. One particular advantage of the present invention is that materials, such as proteins, as exemplified by the enzyme lysozyme, and cDNA, and DNA incorporated Into vectors both viral and nonviral, which are difficult to microencapsulate or process into microspheres can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention without the level of degradation caused by exposure to high temperatures and denaturing solvents often present in other processing techniques.<br>
[000129]      The beneficial agent is preferably incorporated into the viscous gel formed from the polymer and the solvent in the form of particles typically having an average particle size of from about 0.1 to about 250 microns, preferably from about 1 to about 200 microns and often from 30 to 125 microns. For instance, particles having an average particle size of about 5 microns have<br>
43<br><br>
been produced by spray drying or freeze drying an aqueous mixture containing 50% sucrose and 50% chicken iysozyme (on a dry weight basis) and mixtures of 10-20% hGH and 15-30 mM zinc acetate. Such particles have been used in certain of the examples illustrated in the figures. Conventional lyophilization processes can also be utilized to form particles of beneficial agents of varying sizes using appropriate freezing and drying cycles.<br>
[000130]      To form a suspension or dispersion of particles of the beneficial .agent in the viscous gel formed from the polymer and the solvent, any conventional low shear device can be used such as a Ross double planetary mixer at ambient conditions. In this manner, efficient distribution of the beneficial agent can be achieved substantially without degrading the beneficial agent.<br>
[000131]      The beneficial agent is typically dissolved or dispersed in the composition in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 50% by weight, preferably in an amount of from about 1% to about 30%, more preferably in an amount of about 2% to about 20%, and often 2 to 10% by weight of the combined amounts of the polymer mixture, solvent, and beneficial agent. Depending on the amount of beneficial agent present in the composition, one can obtain different release profiles and burst indices. More specifically, for a given polymer and solvent, by adjusting the amounts of these components and the amount of the beneficial agent, one can obtain a release profile that depends more on the degradation of the polymer than the diffusion of the beneficial agent from the composition or vice versa. In this respect, at lower beneficial agent loading rates, one generally obtains a release profile reflecting degradation of the polymer wherein the release rate increases with time. At higher loading rates, one generally obtains a release profile caused by diffusion of the beneficial agent wherein the release rate decreases with time. At intermediate loading rates, one obtains combined release profiles so that if desired, a substantially constant release rate can be attained. In order to minimize burst, loading of beneficial agent on the order of 30% or less by<br>
44<br><br>
weight of the overall gel composition, i.e., polymer, solvent and beneficial agent, is preferred, and loading of 20% or less is more preferred.<br>
[000132]      Release rates and loading of beneficial agent will be adjusted to provide for therapeutically effective delivery of the beneficial agent over the intended sustained delivery period. Preferably, the beneficial agent will be present in the polymer gel at concentrations that are above the saturation concentration of beneficial agent in water to provide a drug reservoir from which the beneficial agent is dispensed. While the release rate of beneficial agent depends on the particular circumstances, such as the beneficial agent to be administered, release rates on the order of from about 0.1 micrograms/day to about 10 milligrams/day, preferably from about 1 microgram/day to about 5 milligrams per day, more preferably from about 10 micrograms/day to about 1 milligram/day, for periods of from about 24 hours to about 180 days, preferably 24 hours to about 120 days, more preferably 24 hours to about 90 days, often 3 days to about 90 days can be obtained. Further, the dose of beneficial agent may be adjusted by adjusting the amount of depot gel injected. Greater amounts may be delivered if delivery is to occur over shorter periods. Generally, higher release rate is possible if a greater burst can be tolerated. In instances where the gel composition is surgically implanted, or used as a "leave behind" depot when surgery to treat the disease state or another condition is concurrently conducted, it is possible to provide higher doses that would normally be administered if the implant was injected. Further, the dose of beneficial agent may be controlled by adjusting the volume of the gel implanted or the injectable gel injected. Preferably, the system releases 40% or less by weight of the beneficial agent present in the viscous gelwithin the first 24 hours after implantation in the subject. More preferably, 30% or less by weight of the beneficial agent will be released within the first 24 hours after implantation, and the implanted composition has a burst index of 12 or less, preferably 8 or less.<br>
45<br><br>
D. Optional Additional Components:<br>
[000133]      Other components may be present in the gel composition, to the extent they are desired or provide useful properties to the composition, such as polyethylene glycol, hydroscopic agents, stabilizing agents, pore forming agents, thixotropic agents and others. When the composition includes a peptide or a protein that is soluble in or unstable in an aqueous environment, it may be highly desirable to include a solubility modulator that may, for example, be a stabilizing agent, in the composition. Various modulating agents are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,654,010 and 5,656,297, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the case of hGH, for example, it is preferable to include an amount of a salt of a divalent metal, preferably zinc: Examples of such modulators and stabilizing agents, which may form complexes with the beneficial agent or associate to provide the stabilizing or modulated release effect, include metal cations, preferably divalent, present in the composition as magnesium carbonate, zinc carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium acetate, magnesium sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, other antacids, and the like. The amounts of such agents used will depend on the nature of the complex formed, if any, or the nature of the association between the beneficial agent and the agent. Molar ratios of solubility modulator or stabilizing agent to beneficial agent of about 100:1 to 1:1, preferably 10:1 to 1:1, typically can be utilized.<br>
[000134]      Pore forming agents include biocompatible materials that when contacted with body fluids dissolve, disperse or degrade to create pores or channels in the polymer matrix. Typically, organic and non-organic materials that are water soluble such as sugars (e.g., sucrose, dextrose), water soluble salts (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, and sodium carbonate), water soluble solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol and water soluble polymers (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like) can conveniently be used as pore formers. Such materials may be present in amounts varying from about 0.1%<br>
46<br><br>
to about 100% of the weight of the polymer, but will typically be less than 50% and more typically less than 10-20% of the weight of polymer.<br>
[000135]      Thixotropic agents include agents that impart thixotropic properties to the polymer gel, such as lower alkanols (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol), and the like. It is to be understood that the thixotropic agent of the present invention does not constitute a mere diluent or a polymer-solvent that reduces viscosity by simply decreasing the concentration of the components of the composition. The use of conventional diluents can reduce viscosity, but can also cause the burst effect mentioned previously when the diluted composition is injected. In contrast, the injectable depot composition of the present invention can be formulated to avoid the burst effect by selecting the thixotropic agent so that once injected into place, the thixotropic agent has little impact on {he release properties of the original system. Preferably, the system releases 40% or less by weight of the beneficial agent present in the viscous gel within the first 24 hours after implantation in the subject. More preferably, 30% or less by weight of the beneficial agent will be released within the first 24 hours after implantation, and the implanted composition has a burst index of 12 or less, preferably 8 or less.<br>
H. Utility and Administration:<br>
J000136]      The means of administration of the implants is not Ijmited to injection, although that mode of delivery may often be preferred. Where the implant will be administered as a leave-behind product, it may be formed to fit into a body cavity existing after completion of surgery or it may be applied as a flowable gel by brushing or palleting the gel onto residual tissue or: bone. Such applications may permit loading of beneficial agent in the gel above concentrations typically present with injectable compositions.<br>
[0001373      Compositions of this invention without beneficial agent are useful for wound healing, bone repair and other structural support purposes.<br>

The polymer/solvent mixture was stirred at 250 Â± 50 rpm (IKA electric stirrer, IKH-Werke GmbH &amp; Co., Stanfen, Germany) for about 5-10 minutes, resulting in a sticky paste-like substance containing polymer particles. The vessel containing the polymer/solvent mixture was sealed and placed in a temperature controlled incubator equilibrated to 37Â°C for 1 to 4 days, with intermittent stirring, depending on solvent and polymer type and solvent and polymer ratios. The polymer/solvent mixture was removed from the incubator when it appeared to be a clear amber homogeneous solution. Thereafter, the mixture was placed in an oven (65Â°C) for 30 minutes. It was noted that the PLGA was dissolved in the mixture upon removal from the oven.<br>
