WATER-SOLUBLE AMINE AND USES THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of water-<br>
dilutable amines and the use thereof as hardeners for<br>
epoxy resins.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Amine hardeners for aqueous epoxy resin dispersions are<br>
known. They typically contain an adduct formed from<br>
polyamines and polyepoxides, which is free of epoxy<br>
groups and contains secondary and possibly primary<br>
amino groups. Often, primary amino groups present in<br>
such an adduct are converted further, since there is<br>
otherwise the disadvantage that the adduct tends to<br>
form carbonate and carbamate salts with carbon dioxide<br>
gas from the air, which can impair the quality of a<br>
hardened film in respect of esthetic and mechanical<br>
properties such as clarity, shine, surface properties,<br>
hardness and toughness.<br>
EP 0 000 605 A1 discloses hardening compositions for<br>
aqueous epoxy resin dispersions in the form of adducts<br>
formed from polyepoxides, polyalkylene polyether<br>
polyols and polyamines. Primary amino groups of the<br>
adducts have been converted to secondary amino groups<br>
by addition onto unsaturated compounds such as<br>
acrylonitrile. These hardening compositions have the<br>
disadvantage that they tend to coagulate at<br>
temperatures in the region of 50°C, i.e. are not<br>
storage-stable.<br>
EP 0 567 831 Al discloses hardening compositions for<br>
aqueous epoxy resin dispersions, which are storage-<br>
stable at 50°C. The emulsifier and coemulsifier<br>
described are each adducts formed from polyamines and<br>
polyepoxides. Primary amino groups of the adducts are<br>
alkylated reductively by means of aldehydes and formic<br>
 <br>
acid and are in the form of secondary amino groups.<br>
However, the hardeners described have disadvantages.<br>
Firstly, the preparation thereof is complicated,<br>
especially owing to the slowness of the reduction<br>
process used, and they secondly tend to form an<br>
esthetically unsatisfactory, hazy film when applied in<br>
a thick layer, for example as an anticorrosion coating.<br>
EP 0 024 915 Al discloses two-pack aqueous epoxy resin<br>
systems, the hardeners of which are present in the form<br>
of polyamine-polyepoxy resin adducts. Primary amino<br>
groups of the adducts are converted by means of<br>
monoepoxides. As a result of the reaction with<br>
monoepoxides, the preparation of the adducts described<br>
takes a very long time.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide compounds which are preparable in a simple<br>
rapid process from readily available raw materials,<br>
which are usable as hardeners for epoxy resins,<br>
especially as a constituent of an aqueous hardener<br>
composition for epoxy resin dispersions, and which<br>
overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
It has been found that, surprisingly, this object is<br>
achieved by compounds as claimed in claim 1. The<br>
compounds can . be used highly advantageously as<br>
hardeners for epoxy resins. More particularly, it has<br>
been found that these compounds have low viscosity, can<br>
be prepared in a simple and rapid manner from readily<br>
available raw materials and are highly suitable as<br>
hardeners for epoxy resins. They are storable<br>
substantially unchanged within a broad temperature<br>
range, have a low processing and mixing viscosity with<br>
the epoxy resin and harden rapidly and completely with<br>
the epoxy resin to develop good adhesion to the<br>
substrate. They meet the high demands on the quality of<br>
 <br>
a hardened film in respect of esthetic and. mechanical<br>
properties such as clarity, shine, surface properties,<br>
hardness and toughness.<br>
It has particularly been shown that these compounds are<br>
highly suitable as aqueous hardeners for epoxy resins.<br>
More particularly, they enable the production of<br>
storage-stable, low-viscosity aqueous hardener<br>
emulsions which are stable especially up to 50°C. Thus,<br>
further aspects of the invention are a process as<br>
claimed in claim 5 for preparation of the compound and<br>
a hardener composition as claimed in claim 10.<br>
It has additionally been found that these hardener<br>
compositions are highly suitable for two- or three-pack<br>
epoxy resin compositions as claimed in claim 16. More<br>
particularly, it is also possible to produce ECC (epoxy<br>
cement concrete) compositions. The compounds or the<br>
aqueous hardener compositions formed therefrom are<br>
especially suitable as a constituent of ECC<br>
compositions which can be used especially as a coating.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention are a hardened<br>
composition as claimed in claim 17 and uses as claimed<br>
in claims 18 and 19.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are the subject<br>
of the dependent claims.<br>

readability and identification.<br>
The acyl enamino groups of the formula (i) are in an<br>
equilibrium with the tautomeric isomers of the formula<br>
 <br>

The amine A2 is preferably an amine having only one<br>
primary amino group. The polyepoxide E is preferably a<br>
diepoxide E1, more preferably a liquid diglycidyl ether<br>
of bisphenols, especially of bisphenol A.<br>
The abbreviation "EEW" in the present document stands<br>
for "epoxy equivalent weight".<br>
 <br>
In the present document, a "glycidyl ether" refers to<br>
an ether of 2,3-epoxy-l-propanol (glycidol).<br>
A compound VB of the formula (I) is preferably a<br>
compound VB of the formula (1a) or (1b) . A compound VB<br>
of the formula (II) is preferably a compound VB of the<br>
formula (IIa) or (IIb).<br>
 <br>
In the formulae (Ia), (Ib), (IIa) and (IIb), R1, R2, R3,<br>
R4 and R5 are each as already defined, and<br>
R6 is an alkyl or cycloalkyl or arylalkyl group which<br>

R6 in the formulae (Ia), (IIa), (Ib) and (IIb) is<br>
preferably an alkyl or cycloalkyl or arylalkyl group<br>
which has at least 4 carbon atoms, especially 4 to 18<br>
carbon atoms, and optionally has ether or secondary<br>
amino groups.<br>
The diepoxide E1 is preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of a bisphenol A, bisphenol F and bisphenol<br>

of 156 to 250 g/eq, N,N-diglycidylaniline and a<br>

weight of 170 to 340 g/eq.<br>
The diepoxide E1 is more preferably a bisphenol A,<br>
bisphenol F and bisphenol A/F diglycidyl ether.<br>
Thus, E1 in the formulae (Ia) and (IIa) and E2 in the<br>
formulae (Ib) and (IIb) are preferably each<br>
independently the remainder of a diepoxide E1 which is<br>
selected from the group consisting of a bisphenol A,<br>
bisphenol F and bisphenol A/F diglycidyl ether having<br>
an epoxy equivalent weight of 156 to 250 g/eq, N,N-<br>
diglycidylaniline and a polyglycol diglycidyl ether<br>
having an epoxy equivalent weight of 170 to 340 g/eq,<br>
especially a bisphenol A, bisphenol F and bisphenol A/F<br>
diglycidyl ether having an epoxy equivalent weight of<br>
156 to 250 g/eq, after removal of two epoxy groups.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing<br>
a compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) as described<br>
above. In this process, (a) at least one polyamine A1<br>
containing at least two primary amino groups,<br>
((3) optionally at least one amine A2 containing only<br>
one primary amino group, (y) at least one polyepoxide E<br>
having an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) of 65 to<br>
500 g/eq and (6) at least one diketone K1 of the<br>
 <br>
formula (IV) or K2 of the formula (V) are reacted with<br>
one another over more than one stage.<br>
 <br>
In the formulae (IV) and (V), R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are<br>
each as already defined.<br>
The ratio between the number of primary amino groups<br>
and epoxy groups is especially 1.25 to 2.0. In<br>
addition, the diketone K1 or K2 is used in a ratio to<br>
the primary amino groups, which are in excess in<br>
relation to the epoxy groups, especially in an amount<br>
of 0.25 to 1.0 equivalent.<br>
In the case that the index a in the formula (I) or (II)<br>
is different than zero, the diketone is used in a<br>
substoichiometric ratio to the primary amino groups,<br>
which are in excess in relation to the epoxy groups.<br>
In the case that the index a in the formula (I) or (II)<br>
is zero, the diketone is used in at least a<br>
stoichiometric ratio to the primary amino groups, which<br>
are in excess in relation to the epoxy groups.<br>
The process can be performed in such a way that, in a<br>
first stage, the polyamine A1 and optionally the amine<br>
A2 are reacted with the polyepoxide E to give an adduct<br>
AE of the formula (III), with predominant reaction of<br>
primary amino groups with the epoxy groups, while<br>
secondary amino groups and hydroxyl groups already<br>
 <br>
present or formed in the course of the reaction react<br>
with epoxy groups only in an insignificant portion, if<br>
at all, owing to the significantly lower reactivity.<br>
 <br>
In the formula (III), A, a and b are each as already<br>
defined.<br>
In a second stage, the adduct AE of the formula (III)<br>
is subsequently reacted with the diketone K1 or K2 of<br>
the formula (IV) or (V) to give a compound VB of the<br>
formula (I) or (II), the diketone reacting with primary<br>
amino groups to eliminate water.<br>
In the case of the diketone Kl of the formula (IV) - a<br>
β-diketone, also known as a 1,3-diketone - a compound<br>
VB of the formula (I) is formed, releasing one mole of<br>
water per mole of diketone Kl converted. This reaction<br>
proceeds very rapidly and virtually quantitatively. It<br>
is preferably performed at a temperature in the range<br>
from 20 to 120°C.<br>
In the case of the diketone K2 of the formula (V) - a γ-<br>
diketone, also known as a 1,4-diketone - a compound VB<br>
of the formula (II) is formed, releasing two moles of<br>
water per mole of diketone K2 converted. This reaction<br>
is also known by the name "Paal-Knorr pyrrole<br>
synthesis". An intermediate (or by-product) which<br>
occurs in the formation of the compound VB of the<br>
formula (II) is the noncyclized form, as shown in the<br>
formula (II') .<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the formula (II'), R4, R5, A, a and b are each as<br>
already defined.<br>
The cyclization to the pyrrole group (condensation<br>
reaction) proceeds in a predominant portion when the<br>
reaction mixture is stirred, for example, at elevated<br>
temperature over a few hours, for example 60 to 120°C.<br>
In addition, the process for preparing a compound VB of<br>
the formula (I) or (II) can also be performed in such a<br>
way that, in a first stage, the polyamine A1 is reacted<br>
with the diketone K1 or K2 with elimination of water to<br>
form an alkylated polyamine All of the formula (VI) or<br>
(VII), in which case the diketones react with primary<br>
amino groups in the manner already described.<br>
 <br>
In the formulae (VI) and (VII),<br>
Q is the remainder of a polyamine Al after removal of<br>
(b+c) primary amino groups;<br>
c is 1 or 2, preferably 1;<br>
 <br>
and R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and b are each as already defined.<br>
In a second stage, the alkylated polyamine A11 is<br>
subsequently, optionally in the presence of the amine<br>
A2, reacted with the polyepoxide E to give a compound<br>
VB of the formula (I) or (II), at least as many free<br>
primary amino groups as epoxy groups still being<br>
present in the reaction mixture.<br>
In the processes described, the reaction of primary<br>
amino groups with epoxy groups is advantageously<br>
performed at a temperature in the range from 60 to<br>
120°C.<br>
The processes described can be performed as a one-pot<br>
reaction. It is thus unnecessary to purify the<br>
intermediate before the 2nd stage is carried out. The<br>
water formed in the reaction between the diketone and<br>
the primary amino groups need not be removed from the<br>
reaction mixture. It can, however, be removed from the<br>
reaction mixture if desired, for example by means of<br>
application of reduced pressure.<br>
It is also possible to prepare a compound VB of the<br>
formula (I) by using, instead of a diketone K1 of the<br>
formula (IV), a ketone of the formula (IVa). In this<br>
case, the primary amino groups are alkylated without<br>
elimination of water.<br>
 <br>
In the formula (IVa) , R1 and R3 are each as already<br>
defined.<br>
 <br>
The polyamine A1 has at least two primary amino groups.<br>

The polyepoxide E has an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW)<br>
of 65 to 500 g/eq. Polyepoxides E can be prepared in a<br>
known manner, for example from the oxidation of the<br>
corresponding olefins or from the reaction of<br>
epichlorohydrin with the corresponding polyols,<br>
polyphenols or amines.<br>
Especially suitable as polyepoxides E are what are<br>
known as polyepoxide liquid resins, referred to<br>
hereinafter as "liquid resin". They have a glass<br>
transition temperature which is typically below 25 oC,<br>
in contrast to solid polyepoxide resins which can be<br>
comminuted to powders which are pourable at 25 °C and<br>
have a glass transition temperature above 25 °C.<br>
Polyepoxides which are known to the person skilled in<br>
 <br>
the art as reactive diluents are also referred to m<br>
the present document as liquid resins.<br>
In one embodiment, the polyepoxide E is an aromatic<br>
polyepoxide. Suitable examples for this purpose are<br>
liquid resins of the formula (IX)<br>
 <br>
where R' and R" are each independently a hydrogen atom<br>
or a methyl group, and s has an average value of 0 to<br>
1. Preference is given to those liquid resins of the<br>
formula (IX) in which the index s has an average value<br>
of less than 0.2.<br>
The liquid resins of the formula (IX) are diglycidyl<br>
ethers of bisphenol A, bisphenol F and bisphenol A/F,<br>
where A represents acetone and F formaldehyde, which<br>
serve as reactants for preparation of these bisphenols.<br>
A bisphenol A liquid resin accordingly has methyl<br>
groups, a bisphenol F liquid resin hydrogen atoms, and<br>
a bisphenol A/F liquid resin both methyl groups and<br>
hydrogen atoms, as R' and R" in formula (IX) . In the<br>
case of bisphenol F, it is also possible for positional<br>
isomers to be present, especially derived from 2,4'-<br>
and 2,2'-hydroxyphenylmethane.<br>

A preferred process for preparing a compound VB of the<br>
formula (I) or (II) is characterized in that (a) at<br>
least one polyamine A1 having two primary amino groups,<br>
(P) at least one amine A2, (γ) at least one diepoxide E1<br>
and (5) at least one diketone K1 of the formula (IV) or<br>
K2 of the formula (V) are reacted with one another in a<br>
molar ratio of 1:(0.8 to 1.2): (0.8 to 1.2): (0.8 to<br>
1.2), especially 1:1:1:1, in one of the sequences<br>
already described, i.e. via an intermediate of the<br>
formula (III), or via an intermediate of the formula<br>
(VI) or (VII).<br>
In a first particularly preferred process, at least one<br>
polyamine Al in the form of a polyoxyalkylenediamine,<br>
 <br>
at least one amine A2 and at least one diepoxide E1 are<br>
reacted in a molar ratio of 1:(0.8 to 1.2): (0.8 to<br>
1.2), especially 1:1:1, to give an adduct AE, and the<br>
latter is subsequently reacted in a molar ratio of<br>
1:(0.8 to 1.2), especially 1:1, with at least one<br>
diketone K1 of the formula (IV) or K2 of the formula<br>
(V) to give a compound VB of the formula (1a) or (IIa).<br>
In a second particularly preferred process, at least<br>
one polyamine A1 in the form of a polyalkyleneamine and<br>
at least one diketone Kl of the formula (IV) or K2 of<br>
the formula (V) are reacted in a molar ratio of 1: (0.8<br>
to 1.2), especially 1:1, to give an alkylated polyamine<br>
All, and the latter is subsequently reacted in a molar<br>
ratio of 1:(0.8 to 1.2): (0.8 to 1.2), especially 1:1:1,<br>
with at least one amine A2 and at least one diepoxide<br>
E1 to give a compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb).<br>
It is also possible to initially charge a compound VB<br>
of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) and to prepare a compound<br>
VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb) therein - effectively<br>
in a solvent. In this way, it is possible in a one-pot<br>
process to prepare a mixture of at least one compound<br>
VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) and at least one<br>
compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb).<br>
The compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) is<br>
preparable in a simple process from readily available<br>
raw materials. It preferably has at least two NH<br>
hydrogen atoms which are active toward epoxy groups and<br>
at least some of which are in the form of secondary<br>
amino groups. Secondary amino groups have formed more<br>
particularly from the reaction of primary amino groups<br>
with epoxy groups. The compound VB, or the A radical,<br>
preferably does not have any primary amino groups. If<br>
it nevertheless has primary amino groups, the number<br>
thereof is preferably 1 or 2. As a result, it barely<br>
reacts, if at all, with carbon dioxide gas from the air<br>
 <br>
and as a result forms a low level of carbonate and/or<br>
carbamate salts, if any. The absence of such salt<br>
formation is very advantageous especially in the case<br>
of use of the compound VB as a hardener for epoxy<br>
resins, since this means that there cannot be any salt-<br>
related optical and/or mechanical defects in the curing<br>
of the epoxy resin, such as more particularly the film<br>
opacity known as "blushing". The acylenamino groups of<br>
the formula (i) from the reaction with the diketone K1<br>
of the formula (IV) - or the pyrrole groups from the<br>
reaction with the diketone K2 of the formula (V) - of<br>
the compound VB are stable, even in the presence of<br>
water and at elevated temperature, for example at 60oC.<br>
Even in the presence of moisture, they do not react to<br>
any significant degree with epoxy groups, in spite of<br>
the enamine nitrogen in the acylenamino group; the<br>
latter is a vinylogous amido group in which the<br>
hydrogen atom of the enamine nitrogen can enter into a<br>
stable intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl<br>
oxygen.<br>
The compound VB has a comparatively low viscosity for<br>
polyepoxide-polyamine adducts.<br>
The compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) can be used<br>
as a reactant for substances which have groups reactive<br>
toward NH and OH groups. Groups reactive toward NH and<br>
OH groups are, for example, isocyanate, isothiocyanate,<br>
cyclocarbonate, epoxide, episulfide, aziridine,<br>
acryloyl, methacryloyl, 1-ethynylcarbonyl, 1-<br>
propynylcarbonyl, maleimide, citraconimide, vinyl,<br>
isopropenyl or allyl groups. The compound VB can<br>
advantageously be used as a hardener for substances<br>
which have at least two of the aforementioned reactive<br>
groups, especially as a hardener for polyisocyanates<br>
and polyepoxides. The compound VB is especially<br>
suitable as a hardener for epoxy resins. The compound<br>
VB is advantageously used as a constituent of a mixture<br>
 <br>
which comprises further substances suitable as<br>
hardeners for epoxy resins.<br>
The compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) is most<br>
suitable as a constituent of a water-dilutable hardener<br>
for aqueous epoxy resin dispersions.<br>
The present invention further provides a hardener<br>
composition comprising at least one compound VB of the<br>
formula (I) or (II), preferably at least one compound<br>
VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) and at least one<br>
compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb), as described<br>
above.<br>
A hardener composition comprising at least one compound<br>
VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) and at least one<br>
compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb) is also<br>
referred to hereinafter as hardener composition H1.<br>
A hardener composition H1 is of similar composition to<br>
the mixture of an emulsifier and a coemulsifier<br>
described in EP 0 567 831 A1. The difference from the<br>
emulsifier-coemulsifier mixture described in<br>
EP 0 567 831 Al is that the primary amino groups have<br>
been converted or capped in another way, namely by<br>
means of at least one diketone K1 of the formula (IV)<br>
or a diketone K2 of the formula (V) instead of by<br>
reductive alkylation by means of aldehyde and formic<br>
acid. The capping of primary amino groups by means of<br>
reductive alkylation forms secondary amino groups,<br>
whereas the reaction with a diketone K1 or K2 caps the<br>
primary amino groups such that they no longer have any<br>
reactivity toward epoxy groups. Surprisingly, the<br>
hardener compositions H1 described, however, are<br>
nevertheless just as suitable as hardeners in epoxy<br>
resin compositions as the emulsifier-coemulsifier<br>
mixtures described in EP 0 567 831 A1. The capping of<br>
the primary amino groups by means of a diketone K1 or<br>
 <br>
K2 has a series of advantages over the reductive<br>
alkylation described in EP 0 567 831 A1. One is that<br>
the reaction with diketone is substantially more rapid,<br>
which means a greatly shortened production time for a<br>
corresponding water-dilutable hardener. In addition,<br>
the reaction with diketone does not form CO2, which can<br>
form troublesome carbonate and carbamate salts with<br>
primary amino groups, as is the case in the reductive<br>
alkylation in EP 0 567 831 A1. The water obtained in<br>
the reaction with the diketones K1 or K2 is not<br>
disruptive in the case of use as a water-dilutable<br>
hardener.<br>
The hardener composition, especially the hardener<br>
composition H1, preferably comprises, in addition to at<br>
least one compound VB of the formula (I) or (II),<br>
(b) at least one adduct AD formed from at least one<br>
polyamine A3 having at least two amino groups in the<br>
form of primary or secondary amino groups and at least<br>
one polyepoxide E having an epoxy eguivalent weight<br>
(EEW) of 65 to 500 g/eq, where the adduct AD has<br>
terminal primary and/or secondary amino groups,<br>
Cc) optionally at least one polyamine A4 having at<br>
least two amino groups in the form of primary or<br>
secondary amino groups, and<br>
(d) optionally water.<br>
Such a preferred hardener composition is referred to<br>
hereinafter as hardener composition H2.<br>
The hardener composition H2 preferably comprises a<br>
mixture of a compound VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa)<br>
and a compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb), as<br>
described above. Such a mixture can display self-<br>
emulsifying action in the hardener composition when<br>
mixed with water.<br>
 <br>
The compound VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) is present<br>
advantageously in an amount of 0.5 to 1.5 parts by<br>
weight, based on 1 part by weight of the compound VB of<br>
the formula (Ib) or (IIb).<br>
In addition, an adduct AD is present in the hardener<br>
composition H2. In one embodiment, suitable polyamines<br>
A3 for preparation of a suitable adduct AD are the same<br>
polyamines as already mentioned above as polyamines Al<br>
having at least two primary amino groups. In a further<br>
embodiment, suitable polyamines A3 are the same<br>
polyamines as already mentioned as amines A2 having one<br>
primary and at least one secondary amino group. In a<br>
further embodiment, suitable polyamines A3 are<br>
polyamines having at least two secondary amino groups,<br>
especially N,N' -dibutylethylenediamine; N,N'-di-tert-<br>
butylethylenediamine, N, N' -diethyl-1,6-hexanediamine,<br>
1-(1-methylethylamino)-3-(1-methylethylaminomethyl)-<br>
3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane (Jefflink® 754 from<br>
Huntsman), N4-cyclohexyl-2-methyl-N2-(2-methylpropyl)-<br>
2, 4-pentanediamine, N,N'-dialkyl-1,3-xylylenediamine,<br>
bis(4-(N-alkylamino)cyclohexyl)methane,	4,4'-<br>
trimethylenedipiperidine, N-alkylated polyetheramines,<br>
for example the Jeffamine® products SD-231, SD-401,<br>
SD-404 and SD-2001 (from Huntsman).<br>
Preferred polyamines A3 for preparation of an adduct AD<br>
are those selected from the group consisting of firstly<br>
polyoxyalkylenediamines of the formula (VIII) having a<br>
molecular weight of at most 1000 g/mol, preferably<br>
Jeffamine® D-230, Jeffamine® D-4 00, Jeffamine® XTJ-511,<br>
Jeffamine® EDR-104, Jeffamine® EDR-148, Jeffamine®<br>
EDR-176; Polyetheramine D 230, Polyetheramine D 400, PC<br>
/Amine® DA 250, PC Amine® DA 4 00 or PC Amine® DA 650,<br>
and secondly isophoronediamine (IPDA), 2,2,4- and<br>
2, 4, 4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine (TMD), 1,3-<br>
xylylenediamine (meta-xylylenediamine or MXDA), 2-<br>
butyl-2-ethyl-1,5-pentanediamine (C11-neodiamine), N-<br>
 <br>
ethyl-1,3-propanediamine and N-cyclohexyl-1,3-<br>
propanediamine.<br>
Suitable and also preferred polyepoxides E for<br>
preparation of a suitable adduct AD are the same<br>
polyepoxides as already described for preparation of a<br>
compound VB of the formula (I) or (II), especially the<br>
diepoxides E1 mentioned.<br>
A particularly suitable adduct AD is the adduct of two<br>
moles of polyamine A3 having two amino groups in the<br>
form of primary or secondary amino groups and one mole<br>
of diepoxide E1.<br>
The adduct AD is present in the hardener composition H2<br>
advantageously in an amount of 0.5 to 1.5 parts by<br>
weight, based on 1 part by weight of the compound VB of<br>
the formula (I) or (II).<br>
Suitable polyamines A4 are the same polyamines as<br>
already mentioned as polyamines A3 for preparation of<br>
an adduct AD, and additionally what are known as<br>
polyamidoamines. A polyamidoamine is the reaction<br>
product of a mono- or polybasic carboxylic acid, or the<br>
esters or anhydrides thereof, and an aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic or aromatic polyamine, the polyamine<br>
being used in a stoichiometric excess. A polybasic<br>
carboxylic acid used is typically what is known as a<br>
dimer fatty acid, and the polyamine used is typically a<br>
polyalkyleneamine, for example TETA. Commercially<br>
available polyamidoamines are, for example, Versamid®<br>
100, 125, 140 and 150 (from Cognis), Aradur® 223, 250<br>
and 848 (from Huntsman), Euretek® 3607, Euretek® 530<br>
(from Huntsman), Beckopox® EH 651, EH 654, EH 655,<br>
EH 661 and EH 663 (from Cytec).<br>
The polyamine A4 present may be the same polyamine as<br>
the polyamine A3 used to prepare an adduct AD, for<br>
 <br>
example by virtue of an excess of polyamine A3 having<br>
been used in the reaction with the polyepoxide E, such<br>
that unreacted polyamine A3 is still present after the<br>
reaction of all epoxy groups.<br>
Preferred polyamines A4 are relatively hydrophobic<br>
polyamines, especially selected from the group<br>
consisting of isophoronediamine, bis(4-aminocyclo-<br>
hexyl)methane, (Hi2-MDA), bis(4-amino-3-methylcyclo-<br>
hexyl)methane, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethylhexa-<br>
methylenediamine (TMD), 1,3-xylylenediamine (meta-<br>
xylylenediamine or MXDA) and 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,5-<br>
pentanediamine (C11-neodiamine).<br>
The polyamine A4 is present in the hardener composition<br>
H2 advantageously in an amount of 0.01 to 0.5 part by<br>
weight, based on 1 part by weight of the sum of the<br>
compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) and of the<br>
adduct AD.<br>
The hardener composition H2 preferably comprises water,<br>
especially in an amount of 20 to 90% by weight, based<br>
on the overall hardener composition.<br>
The hardener	composition H2 more preferably comprises<br>
at least one	compound VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) ,<br>
at least one	compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb),<br>
at least one	adduct AD, at least one polyamine A4 and<br>
water.<br>
A hardener composition H2 can be prepared in any<br>
desired sequence.<br>
In a preferred preparation process, a one-pot process,<br>
at least one compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) is<br>
initially charged, and the adduct AD is prepared<br>
therein - effectively in a solvent. The adduct AD is<br>
advantageously prepared at elevated temperature, fox<br>
 <br>
example at a temperature in the range from 60 to 120oC.<br>
Subsequently, a polyamine A4 is added to the reaction<br>
mixture. And finally, the reaction mixture is diluted<br>
with water until the desired solids content is<br>
attained, for example a solids content in the range<br>
from 10 to 80% by weight.<br>
Compared to a hardening composition as described in<br>
EP 0 567 831 A1, the hardener composition described<br>
here has the great advantage that the preparation of<br>
the compound VB of the formula (I) or (II) is<br>
significantly more rapid than the preparation of the<br>
emulsifier and coemulsifier described in<br>
EP 0 567 831 Al.<br>
The hardener composition H2 may comprise further<br>
substances in the form of assistants and additives.<br>
The hardener composition H2 preferably comprises water<br>
and has a solids content in the range from 10 to 80% by<br>
weight. Such a hardener composition is referred to<br>
hereinafter as aqueous hardener composition HW.<br>
An aqueous hardener composition HW is in the form of an<br>
emulsion. The compound VB of the formula (I) or (II)<br>
may have an emulsifying effect, especially when at<br>
least one compound VB of the formula (Ia) or (IIa) and<br>
at least one compound VB of the formula (Ib) or (IIb)<br>
is present. The appearance of the emulsion depends on<br>
the fineness of the emulsion droplets. Fine emulsions<br>
(microemulsions) are clear or slightly opalescent and<br>
typically have the Tyndall effect, whereas coarse<br>
emulsions (macroemulsions) have a turbid to milky<br>
appearance. Microemulsions have particles which are<br>
within the order of magnitude of visible light or<br>
smaller. A microemulsion typically has a mean particle<br>
size of less than 100 nm.<br>
 <br>
The aqueous hardener composition HW is preferably<br>
present as a microemulsion within a broad temperature<br>
range, especially in the range between 0 and 50°C.<br>
The aqueous hardener composition HW typically has a<br>
relatively low viscosity, such that it is easy to<br>
handle at room temperature.<br>
A preferred aqueous hardener composition HW comprising,<br>
as well as water, at least one compound VB of the<br>
formula (Ia) or (IIa), at least one compound VB of the<br>
formula (Ib) or (IIb), at least one adduct AD and at<br>
least one polyamine A4 is in the form of a<br>
thermodynamically stable emulsion and has a clear to<br>
slightly turbid appearance. Such an aqueous hardener<br>
composition HW can be diluted further by simply<br>
stirring water in. Such an aqueous hardener composition<br>
is typically storage-stable up to a temperature of<br>
50°C. "Storage-stable" refers to the property that the<br>
aqueous hardener composition does not coalesce in the<br>
course of storage, i.e. does not exhibit any phase<br>
separation, and remains useable in the manner intended.<br>
Storage stability up to 50 °C is an important property<br>
which is rarely fulfilled by aqueous epoxy hardeners<br>
according to the prior art.<br>
One of the hardener compositions described is<br>
advantageously used as a constituent of an epoxy resin<br>
composition, and acts as a hardener for at least one<br>
epoxy resin.<br>
The present invention thus further provides a two- or<br>
three-pack epoxy resin composition consisting of a<br>
hardener component C1 and a resin component C2 and<br>
optionally a further component C3.<br>
The two- or three-pack epoxy resin composition can be<br>
used especially as an adhesive, sealing compound,<br>
 <br>
potting compound, coating, floor covering, paint,<br>
varnish, primer or undercoat, preferably as a coating,<br>
especially as a floor coating.<br>
In a first embodiment, the epoxy resin composition<br>
consists of a hardener component C1 and a resin<br>
component C2.<br>
The hardener component C1 comprises at least one<br>
hardener composition as described above.<br>
The resin component C2 comprises at least one epoxy<br>
resin.<br>
Suitable epoxy resins are epoxy resins customary in<br>
epoxy chemistry, for example<br>
-	a polyepoxide E as already specified above;<br>
-	a bisphenol A, F or A/F solid resin which is of<br>
similar composition to the liquid resins of the<br>
formula (IX) already specified as the polyepoxide E,<br>
but instead of the index s has a value of 2 to 12,<br>
and also has a glass transition temperature above<br>
25°C;<br>
-	one of the epoxy resins mentioned, which has been<br>
modified hydrophilically by the reaction with at<br>
least one polyoxyalkylenepolyol.<br>
Preferred epoxy resins are bisphenol A, F or A/F solid<br>
or liquid resins, as available commercially, for<br>
example, from Dow, Huntsman and Hexion.<br>
The epoxy resin may comprise what is known as a<br>
reactive diluent. Suitable reactive diluents are mono-<br>
and polyepoxides, for example the glycidyl ethers of<br>
mono- or polyhydric phenols and aliphatic or<br>
cycloaliphatic alcohols, especially the polyglycidyl<br>
ethers of di- or polyols already mentioned as aliphatic<br>
or cycloaliphatic polyepoxides E, and additionally<br>
 <br>
especially phenyl glycidyl ether, cresyl glycidyl<br>
ether, p-n-butylphenyl glycidyl ether, p-tert-<br>
butylphenyl glycidyl ether, nonylphenyl glycidyl ether,<br>
allyl glycidyl ether, butyl glycidyl ether, hexyl<br>
glycidyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, and<br>
glycidyl ethers of natural alcohols, for example C8- to<br>
C10-alkyl glycidyl ethers or C12- to C14-alkyl glycidyl<br>
ethers, commercially available as Erysis® GE-7 and<br>
Erysis® GE-8 (from CVC) . The addition of a reactive<br>
diluent to the epoxy resin causes a reduction in the<br>
viscosity and - in the hardened state of the epoxy<br>
resin composition - a reduction in the glass transition<br>
temperature and in the mechanical values.<br>
When the hardener composition C1 comprises an aqueous<br>
hardener composition HW, the resin component C2<br>
preferably comprises either what is known as an<br>
"emulsifiable epoxy resin" or an aqueous epoxy resin<br>
dispersion. An epoxy resin dispersion preferably<br>
comprises, as well as water, at least one epoxy resin<br>
as specified above, and additionally at least one<br>
emulsifier, especially a nonionic emulsifier, for<br>
example an alkyl or alkylaryl polyglycol ether,<br>
especially a polyalkoxylated alkylphenol such as<br>
alkylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol, for example a<br>
polyadduct formed from nonylphenol and ethylene oxide,<br>
containing up to 30 mol of ethylene oxide per mole of<br>
nonylphenol.<br>
Commercial epoxy resin dispersions are, for example,<br>
Sika® Repair/Sikafloor® EpoCem® Module A (from Sika<br>
Schweiz AG), Araldite® PZ 323, Araldite® PZ 756/67,<br>
Araldite® PZ 3961 (from Huntsman), XZ 92598.00,<br>
XZ 92546.00, XZ 92533.00 (from Dow), Waterpoxy® 1422,<br>
Waterpoxy® 1455 (from Cognis), Beckopox® EP 384w,<br>
Beckopox® EP 385w, Beckopox® EP 386w, Beckopox®<br>
EP 2340w, Beckopox® VEP 2381w (from Cytec).<br>
 <br>
Epoxy resin dispersions typically have a solids content<br>
in the range of 40-65% by weight.<br>
An emulsifiable epoxy resin preferably contains at<br>
least one emulsifier as already mentioned above as a<br>
constituent of an epoxy resin dispersion.<br>
Commercial	emulsifiable epoxy resins are, for example,<br>
Araldite®	PY 340 and Araldite® PY 340-2 (from<br>
Huntsman),	Beckopox® 122w and Beckopox® EP 147w (from<br>
Cytec).<br>
Both the hardener component C1 and the resin component<br>
C2 may comprise further assistants and additives, for<br>
example<br>
-	nonreactive diluents, solvents or film-forming<br>
assistants, such as toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate or<br>
benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol<br>
butyl ether, dipropylene glycol butyl ether, ethylene<br>

silicones having reactive groups, polysulfides,<br>
butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymers and polyurethanes;<br>
-	polymers, for example polyamides, polysulfides,<br>
polyvinyl formal (PVF), polyvinyl butyral (PVB),<br>
polyurethanes (PUR), styrene-butadiene copolymers,<br>
 <br>

especially from the group comprising ethylene,<br>
propylene, butylene, isobutylene, isoprene, vinyl<br>
acetate and alkyl (meth)acrylates, especially<br>
chlorosulfonated polyethylenes and fluorinated<br>
polymers, sulfonamide-modified melamines;<br>
-	thermoplastic polymers such as polyether sulfone,<br>
polyether imide and bitumen;<br>
-	inorganic and organic fillers, for example ground or<br>

optionally been coated with fatty acids, especially<br>
stearates, barite (heavy spar), talcs, quartz flours,<br>
quartz sand, dolomites, wollastonites, kaolins, mica<br>
(potassium aluminum silicate), molecular sieves,<br>
aluminum oxides, aluminum hydroxides, silicas,<br>
cements, gypsums, fly ashes, carbon black, graphite,<br>

or steel, PVC powders or hollow spheres;<br>
-	fibers, for example of polymer or glass;<br>
-	pigments, for example titanium dioxide or iron<br>
oxides;<br>
-	accelerators which accelerate the reaction between<br>
amino groups and epoxy groups, for example acids or<br>
compounds hydrolyzable to acids, for example organic<br>
carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, benzoic acid,<br>
salicylic acid, 2-nitrobenzoic acid, lactic acid,<br>
organic sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid,<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid or 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic<br>
acid, sulfonic esters, other organic or inorganic<br>
acids, for example phosphoric acid, or mixtures of<br>
the aforementioned acids and acid esters; and also<br>

diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, benzyldimethylamine, a-<br>
methylbenzyldimethylamine, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-<br>
phenol or 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol,<br>
triethanolamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, salts of<br>
such tertiary amines, and quaternary ammonium salts,<br>
for example benzyltrimethylammonium chloride;<br>
 <br>
-	rheology modifiers, such as especially thickeners,<br>
for example sheet silicates such as bentonites,<br>
derivatives of castor oil, hydrogenated castor oil,<br>
polyamides, polyurethanes, urea compounds, fumed<br>
silicas, cellulose ethers and hydrophobically<br>
modified polyoxyethylenes;<br>
-	adhesion improvers, for example organoalkoxysilanes<br>
such as 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-amino-<br>
propyltrimethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-amino-<br>
propyltrimethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-N'-[3-<br>
(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine, 3-ureido-<br>

organoalkoxysilanes with ethoxy instead of the<br>
methoxy groups;<br>
-	heat, light or UV stabilizers;<br>
-	flame-retardant substances;<br>
-	surface-active substances, for example wetting<br>
agents, leveling agents, deaerating agents or<br>
defoamers;<br>
-	biocides, for example algaecides, fungicides or<br>
fungal growth inhibitors.<br>
The hardener component C1 and the resin component C2<br>
can each be stored in a suitable package or<br>
arrangement, for example a drum, a hobbock, a pouch, a<br>
bucket, a canister, a cartridge or a tube, over several<br>
months up to a year and longer before use thereof,<br>
without the particular properties thereof changing to a<br>
degree relevant for the use thereof.<br>
The mixing ratio between the hardener component C1 and<br>
the resin component C2 is preferably selected such that<br>
the groups reactive toward epoxy groups in the hardener<br>
component C1 are in a suitable ratio to the epoxy<br>
groups of the resin component C2. Suitably, 0.7 to 1.5<br>
and preferably 0.9 to 1.1 equivalents of NH hydrogens<br>
 <br>
active toward epoxy groups are present before the<br>
curing per equivalent of epoxy groups.<br>
In parts by weight, the mixing ratio between the<br>
hardener component C1 and the resin component C2 is<br>
typically in the range from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
Before or during the application, the two components<br>
are mixed with one another by means of a suitable<br>
process. The mixing can be effected continuously or<br>
batchwise. If the mixing is effected before the<br>
application, it must be ensured that the time which<br>
passes between the mixing of the components and the<br>
application is not too long, since the result may be<br>
defects, for example a slowed or incomplete buildup of<br>
the adhesion to the solid surface.<br>
With the mixing, the hardening reaction begins. The NH<br>
hydrogens which are reactive toward epoxy groups and<br>
are present in the epoxy resin composition react with<br>
epoxy groups present, which ultimately cures the<br>
composition. The present invention thus also describes<br>
a cured composition which is obtained by mixing the<br>
components of a two- or three-pack epoxy resin<br>
composition as described above.<br>
The application and the hardening are effected<br>
advantageously at temperatures in the range from 5 to<br>
50°C.<br>
The hardening proceeds rapidly and completely. The<br>
hardening rate depends on the ambient temperature and<br>
on any accelerators present. The rate of hardening can<br>
be determined by means of a Byk Gardner drying time<br>
recorder. This involves pulling a needle over a film<br>
applied to a glass strip at a defined speed, and,<br>
according to the degree of hardening of the film, a<br>
"deep trace" is first drawn into the film, then there<br>
 <br>
is a "film tear", which ultimately becomes a "surface<br>
trace" before the film is so dry that the needle no<br>
longer leaves any visible trace. "Flow" refers to the<br>
moment where the applied composition no longer flows<br>
together properly, i.e. the start of the deep trace.<br>
"Soft gel" refers to the moment where the film begins<br>
to tear. "Hard gel" refers to the moment where the film<br>
tear becomes the surface trace, and "cured" refers to<br>
the moment where the surface trace disappears and the<br>
needle no longer leaves any visible trace.<br>
The hardening of the epoxy resin composition described<br>
typically gives rise to clear films with a smooth<br>
surface and high shine, which have a high hardness and<br>
toughness and excellent adhesion on a wide variety of<br>
different substrates.<br>
The epoxy resin composition can be used as an adhesive,<br>
sealing compound, potting compound, coating, floor<br>
covering, paint, varnish, primer or undercoat, for<br>
which important properties may be properties such as<br>
watertightness, corrosion protection, chemical<br>
resistance and/or high hardness and toughness. They may<br>
be used, for example, in construction or civil<br>
engineering, in the manufacture or repair of industrial<br>
goods or consumer goods.<br>
In a further embodiment, the epoxy resin composition<br>
consists of a hardener component C1, a resin component<br>
C2 and a further component C3. In this embodiment, the<br>
hardener component C1 preferably comprises at least one<br>
aqueous hardener composition HW, the resin component C2<br>
preferably comprises at least one epoxy resin<br>
dispersion, and the component C3 comprises at least one<br>
hydraulically setting mineral substance. Such an epoxy<br>
resin composition is also referred to as ECC<br>
composition (ECC stands for "epoxy cement concrete").<br>
 <br>
Suitable hydraulically setting mineral substances are<br>
-	substances which are referred to conventionally as<br>
hydraulic binders and are hardenable with water, even<br>
under water, such as lime and especially cement;<br>
-	latently hydraulic binders which set with water under<br>
the action of additives, such as especially blast<br>
furnace slag for fly ash;<br>
-	substances which react with water only under air,<br>
known as nonhydraulic binders, such as especially<br>
gypsum, Sorel cement, anhydrite, magnesia binders and<br>
white lime.<br>
Thus, in the present document, not only cements but<br>
especially also calcium sulfate in the form of<br>
anhydrite, hemihydrate gypsum or dihydrate gypsum, or<br>
blast furnace slags, are referred to as hydraulically<br>
setting substances.<br>
The hydraulically setting substance is preferably a<br>
cement, especially a cement according to European<br>
standard EN 197. Preferred cements are portland<br>
cements, sulfoaluminate cements and high-alumina<br>
cements, especially portland cement. Mixtures of<br>
cements can lead to particularly good properties.<br>
Particularly suitable are mixtures of at least one<br>
portland cement with either at least one sulfoaluminate<br>
cement or with at least one high-alumina cement. For<br>
rapid hardening, cementitious quick-setting binders in<br>
particular are used, which preferably comprise at least<br>
one high-alumina cement or another aluminate source,<br>
for example aluminate-donating clinker, and optionally<br>
calcium sulfate in the form of anhydrite, hemihydrate<br>
or dihydrate gypsum and/or calcium hydroxide.<br>
Component C3 optionally comprises further substances,<br>
for example various sand types or quartz flours, fly<br>
ash, pigments, and assistants and additives customary<br>
 <br>
in the cement industry, for example plasticizers or<br>
setting accelerators or defoamers.<br>
Component C3 of an ECC composition is typically in<br>
pulverulent form, whereas the hardener component C1 and<br>
the resin component C2 are in liquid form.<br>
An ECC composition is typically used as a high-quality<br>
coating or mortar, which are moisture-proof, have good<br>
mechanical properties, low shrinkage and good adhesion,<br>
especially on moist substrates, for example as a floor<br>
covering, barrier .layer for sealing from wetness and<br>
moisture, as a screed, jointing mortar or tile<br>
adhesive, as a leveling, spackling or primer compound,<br>
or as a repair mortar. In addition, such ECC<br>
compositions are notable for high chemical resistance.<br>
The epoxy resin compositions described are applied to<br>
at least one substrate, suitable substrates being the<br>
following:<br>
-	glass, glass ceramic, concrete, mortar, brick, tile,<br>
gypsum and natural stone, such as granite or marble;<br>
-	metals or alloys, such as aluminum, steel, iron,<br>
nonferrous metals, galvanized metals;<br>
-	leather, textiles, paper, wood, resin-bonded woodbase<br>
materials, resin-textile composite materials and<br>
further polymer composites;<br>
-	polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (rigid and<br>
flexible PVC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene<br>
copolymers (ABS), SMC (sheet molding compounds),<br>
polycarbonate (PC), polyamide (PA), polyester,<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) , polyester, epoxy<br>
resins, polyurethanes (PUR), polyoxymethylene (POM),<br>
polyolefins (PO), polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene<br>
(PP), ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPM) and<br>
ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers (EPDM), and the<br>
polymers may preferably be surface-treated by means<br>
of plasma, corona or flame;<br>
 <br>
- coated substrates such as powder-coated metals or<br>
alloys; and paints and other coating materials.<br>
If required, the substrates may be pretreated before<br>
the application of the epoxy resin composition. Such<br>
pretreatments include especially physical and/or<br>
chemical cleaning processes, for example grinding, sand<br>
blasting, shot blasting, brushing or the like, dusts<br>
which arise advantageously being removed by suction,<br>
and also treatment with detergents or solvents, or the<br>
application of an adhesion promoter, of an adhesion<br>
promoter solution or of a primer.<br>

3. Preparation of hardener compositions of the H1<br>
type<br>
Example 1<br>
A round-bottom flask under a nitrogen atmosphere was<br>
initially charged with 200.0 g of Jeffamine® ED-2003<br>
and 20.0 g of Armeen® CD at a temperature of 90°C. With<br>
good stirring, 37.5 g of Araldite® GY 250 were added<br>
slowly, in the course of which it was ensured that the<br>
temperature did not rise above 105oC, and the reaction<br>
mixture was subsequently stirred further at 90°C over<br>
the course of 2 hours. Then 11.4 g of 2,5-hexanedione<br>
were added and stirred in at 90 °C over the course of<br>
15 nain. Then 52.2 g of N4-Amine, then a further 34.2 g<br>
of 2,5-hexanedione, were added to the reaction mixture<br>
and stirred in at 90 °C over the course of 15 min. Then<br>
a further 60.0 g of Armeen® CD, then a further 112.5 g<br>
of Araldite® GY 250, were added, in the course of which<br>
it was ensured that the temperature did not rise above<br>
105°C. Finally, the reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
90'C for a further 2 hours and then cooled.<br>
A yellowish, waxy material which was solid at room<br>
temperature was obtained. The viscosity thereof at 50oC<br>
and the (calculated) NH equivalent weight are reported<br>
in Table 1. In the present document, the NH equivalent<br>
 <br>
weight refers to the equivalent weight per hydrogen<br>
atom bonded to an amine nitrogen.<br>
Examples 2 to 7 and Comparative examples 8 and 9<br>
Examples 2 to 7 and comparative example 8 were prepared<br>
analogously to example 1, using the ingredients<br>
according to the information in Table 1 in the sequence<br>
specified. The amounts are reported in grams. In<br>
comparative example 8, after the addition of<br>
dimethylacrylamide, a reaction time of 1 hour instead<br>
of 15 minutes was observed in each case before a<br>
further addition. In comparative example 9, after the<br>
first addition of butylene oxide, a reaction time of 14<br>
hours at 60°C instead of 15 minutes at 90°C was<br>
observed, and, after the second addition of butylene<br>
oxide, a reaction time of 3 hours at 60 °C and then 90<br>
minutes at 90°C was observed, before the further<br>
addition in each case.<br>
All hardener compositions of examples 1 to 7 and of<br>
comparative examples 8 and 9 were in the form of<br>
yellowish, solid, waxy materials at room temperature.<br>
In the molten state, they were dilutable with water by<br>
simple stirring with a spatula to obtain an almost<br>
clear liquid in each case. The preparation time of<br>
comparative example 9 is significantly longer than the<br>
preparation times of the hardener compositions of<br>
examples 1 to 7.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
4. Production of hardener compositions of the H2 or<br>
HW type<br>
Example 10<br>
A round-bottom flask under a nitrogen atmosphere was<br>
initially charged with 200 g of the hardener<br>
composition from example 1, to which 126.5 g of<br>
Jeffamine® D-230 were added, and the reaction mixture<br>
was heated to 90 °C while stirring. Then, with good<br>
stirring, 98.5 g of Araldite® GY 250 were added<br>
gradually, in the course of which it was ensured that<br>
the temperature did not rise above 105oC. Finally, the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for a further<br>
90 min, then 75 g of isophoronediamine and 489.1 g of<br>
water were stirred in successively, and the mixture was<br>
cooled.<br>
A yellowish, clear liquid was obtained. The viscosity<br>
at 20°C, the (calculated) NH equivalent weight, the<br>
water content (incl. water formed, in % by weight) and<br>
the storage stability at 50°C are reported in Table 2.<br>
Examples 11 to 17 and comparative examples 18 and 19<br>
Examples 11 to 17 and comparative examples 18 and 19<br>
were prepared analogously to example 10, using the<br>
ingredients according to the information in Table 2.<br>
The amounts are reported in grams.<br>
In all examples apart from comparative examples 18	and<br>
19, a clear liquid was obtained in each case.	The<br>
appearance was assessed visually and reported	in<br>
Table 2.<br>
For the assessment of storage stability ("storage<br>
stabso'c") i the hardener compositions were heated to 50°C<br>
over the course of 4 weeks. When no coalescence<br>
occurred within this time, the composition was<br>
designated stable or "ok", and otherwise as unstable or<br>
"no".<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
5. Production of epoxy resin compositions<br>
Examples 20 to 27 and comparative examples 28 and 29<br>
The hardener compositions of the H2 or HW type from<br>
examples 10 to 17 and the hardener compositions from<br>
comparative examples 18 and 19 were mixed in the<br>
proportions by weight specified in Table 3 with 50<br>
parts by weight of the epoxy resin dispersion Sika®<br>
Repair/Sikafloor® EpoCem® Module A (EEW = 288.7 g/eq,<br>
solids content = 62% by weight; Sika Schweiz AG) . For<br>
each mixed composition, a film with a layer thickness<br>
of 76 um was drawn down onto a glass plate, and a film<br>
with a layer thickness of 500 um onto a further glass<br>
plate.<br>
The following tests were carried out thereon:<br>
The hardening rate was determined on a freshly applied<br>
film in a layer thickness of 76 una on glass by means of<br>
a BYK-Gardner drying time recorder (Beck-Koller<br>
method): in Table 3, the start of the deep trace<br>
("flow") was designated "tflow, the start of film<br>
tearing ("soft gel") "tsoft gel", the start of the surface<br>
trace ("hard gel") "thard gel", and the end of the surface<br>
trace ("cured") "tcured".<br>
The hardness was determined as the Buchholz hardness on<br>
a film drawn down onto a glass plate in a layer<br>
thickness of 500 µm, after a hardening time of 30 days<br>
at 23°C and 50% relative humidity (r.H.), by means of a<br>
PIG universal instrument from Byk-Gardner.<br>
The adhesion was determined on glass on a film drawn<br>
down onto a glass plate in a layer thickness of 500 um.<br>
To test the adhesion, the film was repeatedly incized<br>
down to the glass plate with a blade, and attempts were<br>
made to detach the film from the glass plate with the<br>
blade. If this was impossible, the adhesion was<br>
designated "good".<br>
 <br>
The appearance was assessed on two films each on glass<br>
with layer thicknesses of 76 µm and 500 µm, and<br>
designated in Table 3 as appearance (76 yua) and as<br>
appearance (500 µm) . The appearances were designated<br>
clear ("clear"), hazy ("hazy"), impeccable ("imp.") and<br>
structured ("struc") . Impeccable films are considered<br>
to be those which are clear, shiny and tack-free, and<br>
have no surface structure whatsoever. Structured films<br>
are considered to be those whose surface is not<br>
completely smooth but has a slight orange-like skin.<br>
The results of the tests are reported in Table 3.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
6. Preparation of ECC compositions<br>
Example 30<br>
7.2 parts by weight of the hardener composition from<br>
example 10 were mixed with 17.6 parts by weight of<br>
water and 0.19 part by weight of defoamer (BYK®-023,<br>
BYK-Chemie) (= hardener component) . To this were added<br>
10 parts by weight of Sika® Repair/Sikafloor® EpoCem®<br>
Module A (EEW = 288.7 g/eq, solids content = 62% by<br>
weight; Sika Schweiz AG) (= resin component) and 150<br>
parts by weight of Sikafloor®-81 EpoCem® component C<br>
(Sika Schweiz AG) (=cementitious powder), and-<br>
everything was mixed thoroughly. The ECC composition<br>
obtained was used to determine the solidification time<br>
to EN 480-2, the slump to EN 1015-3 and the compressive<br>
strength and the flexural tensile strength on prisms of<br>
dimensions 40x40x160 mm to EN 13892-2, the tensile<br>
adhesive strength to EN 13892-8 and the shrinkage<br>
(change in length) of prisms of dimensions 40x40x160 mm<br>
to DIN 52450 after storage under standard climatic<br>
conditions (23oC, 50% relative humidity) for different<br>
durations. The results are reported in Table 4.<br>
Example 31<br>
In the same way as described for example 30, the<br>
hardener composition from example 13 was used to<br>
produce an ECC mortar, and it was tested. The results<br>
are reported in Table 4.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The ECC compositions of examples	30 and 31 have<br>
exceptionally good processability,	have very good<br>
mechanical properties and harden	with impeccable<br>
surface appearance.<br>
