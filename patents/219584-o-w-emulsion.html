TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an 0/W emulsion composition containing an electrolyte. More particularly, the present invention relates to an 0/W emulsion composition excellent in emulsion stability despite its electrolyte content. The invention further relates to a method for preparing an O/W emulsion composition excellent in emulsion stability. Moreover, the invention relates to a method for stabilizing the emulsion of an 0/W emulsion composition containing an electrolyte.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various physiological functions of electrolytes are widely known.  It is necessary, however, to incorporate at least a specific concentration of an electrolyte in order to prepare pharmaceutical compositions that are capable of effectively exhibiting the functions provided by electrolytes.  Since electrolytes have a characteristic of decreasing the strength of membranes formed at oil/water interfaces, it is known that when an emulsion composition, particularly<br><br>
an 0/W emulsion composition, containing an electrolyte is prepared, emulsion particles agglomerate and are likely to cause a separation of water and oil phases, oil floating, etc. Moreover, the emulsion itself sometimes degenerates over time due to the influence of the electrolyte, resulting changes in color and smell.<br>
When preparing emulsion compositions containing an electrolyte, therefore, various pharmaceutical techniques are employed to improve the stability of the emulsion.<br>
Although polyglycerin fatty acid esters are emulsifiers heretofore known to be highly safe and excellent in usability and functionality, the emulsifying ability thereof is relatively low. Therefore, when a large number of electrolytes are used, it is difficult to prepare a stable emulsion composition from the polyglycerin fatty acid ester. Recently, a nonaqueous emulsion method was proposed as a method for preparing a stable emulsion using a polyglycerin fatty acid ester (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 37040/1981). Even when this method is employed, phenomena such as oil floating and the like sometimes occur as the concentration of the electrolyte increases and the emulsifying ability decreases. Further, an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer has recently drawn attention as an excellent<br><br>
high-molecular emulsifier for an 0/W emulsion due to properties such as the ability to provide a stable emulsion by a small amount; the ability to be used regardless of the type of oil, thereby making it versatile; gentleness to humans and the environment; an excellent feel when applied to the skin and hair related to a lack of tackiness; etc. However, it is also reported that the viscosity and the emulsion stability are decreased when the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer is used with ionic components. ("Function and Application of High-Molecular Emulsifier for 0/W Emulsion" FRAGRANCE JOURNAL 1998-8 pp. 79-83)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an 0/W emulsion composition that is excellent in emulsion stability despite having an electrolyte contained as an ingredient and that stably maintains its emulsified state over a long period of time. Another object of the invention is to provide various external preparations that exhibit, in addition to good emulsion stability, desired functions derived from the electrolyte contained as an ingredient therein, and that can be used in the field of medical or quasi-medical drugs and in the field of fragrances and cosmetics.<br><br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method for preparing an 0/W emulsion composition excellent in emulsion stability despite its electrolyte content, and a method for stabilizing the emulsion of the 0/W emulsion composition containing an electrolyte.<br>
The inventors conducted research for the purpose of stably emulsifying a composition containing an electrolyte and found that it is possible to emulsify electrolytes by the combined use of an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer and a known emulsifier, i.e., a polyglycerin fatty acid ester, even though the polyglycerin fatty acid ester alone could not heretofore emulsify. However, the inventors also found that the emulsion particles of the polyglycerin fatty acid ester and those of the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer agglomerate due to long term storage or temperature change, and they gelate on the inner wall of a container and in the upper layer of the emulsion. The inventors conducted further research in view of the above findings and discovered that the further addition of an alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof prevents the gelation caused by temperature change and disadvantages such as oil floating and separation caused by long-term storage, thus enabling an emulsion composition excellent in emulsion stability to be prepared. The present invention has been<br><br>

It is preferable to use the oil in a proportion of 0.3 to 20 wt.% per 100 wt.% of the final emulsion composition, more preferably in a proportion of 0.5 to 15 wt.%.<br>
Although the preparation method for the 0/W emulsion composition is not limited, it is preferable to prepare it according to the method described below:<br>
(1)	The polyglycerin fatty acid ester and the alkanoyl<br>
lactylic acid or the salt thereof are mixed with the oil<br>
and preferably with the polyhydric alcohol. The mixture<br>
is stirred while being heated. After the mixture is<br>
uniformly dissolved, it is cooled to give a nonaqueous<br>
emulsion.<br>
(2)	The nonaqueous emulsion thus obtained is blended with<br>
an aqueous solution (aqueous composition) that is<br>
separately prepared and contains the electrolyte, the<br>
water, and the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer.<br>
The O/W emulsion composition is then prepared according to<br>
a conventional method.<br>
It is preferable to use the polyhydric alcohol in Process (1) for preparing the nonaqueous emulsion in order to further improve the development of the emulsifying ability of the polyglycerin fatty acid ester, the alkanoyl lactylic acid, etc.<br><br>
Polyhydric alcohols usable herein are not limited. Specific examples include polyglycerins having a polymerization degree of 2 to 10 (for example, diglycerin, triglycerin, tetraglycerin, etc.), ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, 1,3-buthylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, isoprene glycol, pentadiol, sorbitol, maltitol, fructose, and the like. The use of glycerin is preferable. These polyhydric alcohols may be used alone or in combination of two or more species. In this case, the polyhydric alcohol is used in a proportion of 0.05 to 15 wt.% per 100 wt.% of the final emulsion composition, preferably in a proportion of 3 to 10 wt.%.<br>
In Process (2), which is for emulsification, a lower alcohol can be incorporated in addition to the electrolyte, the water, and the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer in the aqueous solution (aqueous composition) that is blended with the nonaqueous emulsion. This enhances the percutaneous absorption of the electrolyte. Lower alcohols usable in the invention are not limited, but are usually suitably selected from alcohols having 1 to 6 carbons. Preferable examples are ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and like Ci_4 alcohols. These lower alcohols may be used alone or in combination of two or more species. The use of ethanol is preferable.<br><br>
In this case, the lower alcohol is used in a proportion of 0.5 to 15 wt.% per 100 wt.% of the final emulsion composition, preferably in a proportion of 3 to 10 wt.%.<br>
Moreover, a polyhydric alcohol can be used in the aqueous solution described above (aqueous composition). The use thereby makes it possible to control the moisturizing ability and sensory characteristics of the final emulsion composition to the desired degree. Polyhydric alcohols usable in the aqueous solution include those described above. When a polyhydric alcohol is used in the preparation of the nonaqueous emulsion, it is preferable to use polyhydric alcohols that are identical or highly compatible therewith.<br>
Examples of the method for emulsifying the mixture of the nonaqueous emulsion and the aqueous solution (aqueous composition) include stirring the mixture under atmospheric pressure or high pressure using a homomixer. The particles of the resulting emulsion can be further refined by a homogenizer as required.<br>
The proportion of the nonaqueous emulsion to the aqueous solution (aqueous composition) is not limited. It is usually desirable to control the proportion of the nonaqueous emulsion to 1 to 40 wt.%, preferably 1 to 30 wt.%, based on 100 wt.% of the final emulsion composition, thereby giving a more stable 0/W emulsion composition.<br><br>
The 0/W emulsion composition of the invention, insofar as the effects of the invention are not impaired, may contain, as required, a wide range of known substances, such as humectants, UV absorbers, UV dispersants, vitamins, plant extracts, astringents, anti-inflammatory agents, whiteners, antioxidants, cell activators, and especially those known substances used in externally-applied compositions suitable for the skin, such as cosmetics and externally-applied medical/quasi-medical drugs in addition to surfactants, coloring matter (dyes, pigments), aromatics, antiseptic agents, bactericides, thickeners, antioxidants, sequestering agents, pH adjusters, deodorizers, and a wide variety of additives.<br>
The viscosity of the 0/W emulsion composition of the invention is not limited. When the 0/W emulsion composition is employed as a cosmetic suitable for the skin or as an externally-applied medical or quasi-medical drug, it is usually desirable to prepare the 0/W emulsion composition to have a viscosity of 30,000 cps or less, preferably 500 to 20,000 cps, at a temperature of 20°C.<br>
The 0/W emulsion composition of the invention stably maintains its emulsified state by inhibiting the oil separation that is typically caused by long-term storage under a condition in which the 0/W emulsion composition is likely to be affected by temperature change,<br><br>
even when an electrolyte is contained therein in any amount desired in accordance with the use and the effect intended, especially in any amount desired from the range of 0.1 wt.% or more, preferably 0.1 to 6 wt.%. The 0/W emulsion composition of the invention can be prepared, according to the intended use, to provide an excellent, non-tacky feel when used to the skin. The 0/W emulsion composition of the invention is therefore especially useful for external preparations, such as cosmetics suitable for the skin (including the scalp), and externally-applied medical and quasi-medical drugs for the skin (including the scalp). Particularly, when adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or the salt thereof is used as an electrolyte, the invention can be prepared as a cosmetic and external preparation for the skin (medical or quasi-medical drug) that is excellent in its moisturizing effect, prevention of dryness and aging, and ability to cure rough skin due to the action of the AMP or the salt thereof.<br>
When the 0/W emulsion composition of the<br>
invention is prepared as an external preparation such as a cosmetic or an external preparation for skin (medical or quasi-medical drug), the form thereof is not limited. Examples include emulsions, suspensions, creams, and the like.<br>
Examples of cosmetics include emollient<br><br>
emulsions, milky lotions, nourishing emulsions, cleansing emulsions, and like emulsions; emollient creams, massage creams, cleansing creams, makeup creams, and like creams; and the like. These cosmetics are applied to the skin in a suitable amount per application or with a suitable frequency per day, according to the age of the user, the gender, the intended use, the condition of the affected part of the skin, etc.<br>
(2) Method for stabilizing the emulsion of an 0/W emulsion composition containing an electrolyte<br>
The present invention also provides a method for stabilizing the emulsion of an O/W emulsion composition containing an electrolyte. This method can be demonstrated by preparing an O/W emulsion composition using an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer, a polyglycerin fatty acid ester, and an alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof, in addition to an electrolyte, water, and an oil, all of which are as described above. To give higher emulsion stability to the emulsion composition, a polyhydric alcohol may be further added in addition to the ingredients mentioned above.<br>
Specifically, the method can be demonstrated by incorporating the polyglycerin fatty acid ester in a proportion of 0.05 to 6 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 5.5 wt.%;<br><br>
the alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof in a proportion of 0.01 to 1 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 wt.%; and the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer in a proportion of 0.01 to 0.8 wt.%, preferably 0.3 to 0.6 wt.%, more preferably 0.4 to 0.6 wt.% into 100 wt.% of the final 0/W emulsion composition containing the electrolyte in a proportion of 0.1 wt.% or more, preferably 0.5 to 7 wt.%, more preferably 1 to 6 wt.%.  In this case, the proportion of the oil contained in the final 0/W emulsion composition is not limited, but is preferably 0.3 to 20 wt.%, more preferably 0.5 to 15 wt.%. The water accounts for the portion of the 0/W emulsion composition other than that constituted by the oil and other ingredients.  The proportion of the water is not limited, but is usually suitably selected from the range of 50 to 90 wt.%, preferably 60 to 80 wt.%.<br>
It is preferable to use the polyglycerin fatty acid ester and the alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof in such a proportion that the HLB value of the mixture will be 10 or more, preferably 10 to 13. Specifically, it is preferable to use the polyglycerin fatty acid ester and the alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof in such a proportion that the weight ratio thereof will be 95:5 to 60:40, preferably 90:10 to 70:30.<br>
When a polyhydric alcohol is incorporated, the<br><br>
proportion thereof is, for example, in a range of 0.05 to 15 wt.%, preferably 2 to 10 wt.%.<br>
More specifically, the method of the invention can be demonstrated by using each ingredient in the proportion specified above and then preparing an 0/W emulsion composition as described below:<br>
1)	The polyglycerin fatty acid ester and the alkanoyl<br>
lactylic acid or the salt thereof are mixed with the oil<br>
and preferably with the polyhydric alcohol. The mixture<br>
is stirred while being heated. After the mixture is<br>
uniformly dissolved, it is cooled to give a nonaqueous<br>
emulsion.<br>
2)	The nonaqueous emulsion thus obtained is blended with<br>
an aqueous solution (aqueous composition) that is<br>
separately prepared and contains the electrolyte, the<br>
water, and the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer.<br>
The 0/W emulsion composition is then prepared according to<br>
a conventional emulsifying method.<br>
By preparing an 0/W emulsion composition as described above, emulsion stability can be given to the 0/W emulsion composition, and the oil separation that is typically caused by long-term storage under conditions in which the 0/W emulsion composition is likely to be affected by temperature change can be significantly inhibited, thereby providing an emulsion composition that<br><br>
stably maintains its emulsified state.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is described in more detail with reference to the following examples, but the scope of the present invention is not limited by these examples. Examples 1 to 8<br>
A polyglycerin fatty acid ester, an alkanoyl lactylate, an oil, and a polyhydric alcohol were blended, dissolved while being heated, and cooled, to prepare a uniform nonaqueous emulsion. Mixed therewith was an aqueous composition (aqueous solution) that was separately prepared by dissolving in distilled water (pure water) an electrolyte, an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer, a polyhydric alcohol, and a lower alcohol. The mixture was stirred by a homomixer to give the emulsion composition of the present invention (Examples 1 to 8). Table 1 shows the ingredients for the final emulsion compositions.<br>
Each of the eight emulsion compositions thus prepared was placed in two transparent glass bottles. One bottle was left to stand for 2 weeks at a temperature of 60°C, and the other bottle was subjected to a 15-cycle test at temperatures ranging from -5°C to 40°C (1 cycle: 24 hours). The appearance (separation, oil floating,<br><br>
presence/absence of gel formation) of each emulsion composition after the test was visually observed and evaluated according to the following criteria. <evaluation criteria> O: Neither separation, oil floating, nor gel formation<br>
was observed. X: Separation, oil floating, or gel formation was<br>
observed.<br>
For comparison, an emulsion composition<br>
(Comparative Example 1) containing no alkanoyl lactylate, and an emulsion composition (Comparative Example 2) containing no acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer were prepared in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 8 (Table 2 shows the ingredients for these emulsion compositions), and were subjected to the emulsion stability test as described above.<br>
Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the emulsion stability test for the emulsion compositions of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 2. Table 1<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
As can be seen from the tables, the 0/W emulsion composition of the present invention inhibits water/oil phase separation, oil floating and gel formation and stably maintains its emulsified state under conditions in which the emulsion composition is likely to be affected by long-term storage and temperature change, even when it contains a relatively large amount of electrolyte as in the emulsion composition of Example 4. On the other hand, as the comparative examples show, the emulsion composition containing no acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer (Comparative Example 2) lacked long-term emulsion stability, and the emulsion composition containing no alkanoyl lactylate (Comparative Example 1) gelated due to the temperature change, thus failing to maintain a stable emulsified state. Administration Examples 1 to 7 Milky lotions<br>
0/W emulsion compositions having the formulation of Examples 1 and 3 to 8 (in Table 1) were prepared as milky lotions (Administration Examples 1 to 7) in the same manner as the Examples. Administration Example 8 Lotion<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present invention provides an 0/W emulsion composition excellent in long-term emulsion stability despite its electrolyte content, which is generally considered to make emulsification difficult. The invention also provides a method for increasing the<br>
emulsion stability of an 0/W emulsion composition containing a comparatively large amount of electrolyte. The present invention, therefore, provides an electrolyte-containing 0/W emulsion composition that can efficiently exhibit the various physiological functions of the electrolyte.<br>
The O/W emulsion composition of the invention can contain a large amount of electrolyte in a stable manner and is thus useful for cosmetics and external preparations (medical and quasi-medical drugs) for the skin containing electrolytes as active ingredients. Especially, 0/W emulsion compositions containing adenosine monophosphate (AMP), the salt thereof, or like nucleic acid-related substances can effectively exhibit the moisturizing and skin exfoliation-promoting action of these substances, and are therefore useful for cosmetics and external preparations for skin that are effective in preventing fine wrinkles, giving elasticity to the skin, and providing other like effects to keep the skin from aging and to beautify the skin.<br>
Further, the present invention provides an 0/W emulsion composition that has, in addition to excellent long-term emulsion stability, an excellent feel when used on the skin, with significantly suppressed oiliness and tackiness, which is achieved by appropriately controlling<br>
the types and proportions of the electrolyte, polyglycerin fatty acid ester, alkanoyl lactylic acid or the salt thereof, acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer, polyhydric alcohol, water, and oil contained therein.<br>
As described above, the 0/W emulsion composition of the invention is useful especially for externally-applied agents, for example, skin cosmetics (including cosmetics for the scalp) and externally-applied medicines and quasi-medicines for the skin (including the scalp).<br><br><br>
