FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of insulin compounds including their analogs or derivatives thereof from their corresponding precursor forms by a one step enzymatic reaction involving the combinatorial and concurrent use of optimal quantities of trypsin and carboxypeptidase B that work synergisticafly directing the reaction in a controlled manner to avoid production of random undesired byproducts. Particularly, the enzymatic conversion reactions of the instant invention offer advantages of reduction in the number operational steps, higher yield and purity of the desired end products.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Genetic engineering methods are increasingly allowing precursor forms of insulin to be expressed in microorganisms (EP-A-347 781, EP-A-367 163). The pre pro sequences are usually cleaved off chemically and/or enzymatically (DE-P-3 440 988, EP-A-0264250). Known enzymatic conversion methods are based on cleavage with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B {Kcmmler W. et al. J. Biol. Chem., 246 (1971) 6786-6791; EP-A-195 691; EP-B-89007). In the typical process of conversion of Insulin precursor molecule to the corresponding molecule, the linker peptide between the A and B chains are removed. The enzymatic reactions with trypsin is an enzymatic and complex reaction that cleaves not only those peptide bonds whose cleavage produces human insulin or the desired end products but also, in a competing reaction, cleavage at other susceptible sites produce a plurality of undesired byproducts.<br>
Prior art methods include the use of trypsin and a second enzyme carboxypeptidase in such manner that the second enzyme carboxypeptidase is added when the required intermediate will be formed in the reaction. The disadvantage of these methods is the formation of large amounts of impurity byproducts which can be removed from the reaction solution only with difficulty. In the particular case of the conversion of human precursor form of into human insulin (human insulin. HI), there is formation of targe amounts of des-Thr(B30)-human insulin (des-Thr(B30)-HI).<br><br>
From the above, it is evident that it would be advantageous to follow a simpler enzymatic reaction process for cleavage of precursor insulin compounds, their analogs and derivatives thereof to insulin through a much simpler step that removes the possible formations of polymeric impurities as completely as possible and, at the same time, increases the concentration of desired insulin end product as much as possible. An additional condition is the need to ensure a high yield overall enhancing the ease of operation, quality as well as the quantity of the desired end product.<br>
The disadvantages of the known processes have been remedied by the enzymatic reactions carried out in the instant invention, and it has turned out that the increase in yield without undesired byproducts is relative to the optimal concentration of trypsin and carboxypeptidase used under conducive reaction conditions. The inventors have endeavored to develop an improved one step enzymatic reaction process involving the combinatorial and concurrent use of optimal quantities of trypsin and carboxypeptidase B that work synergist!cally to provide the desired end products enhancing the ease of operation, purity and yield of the end products.<br>

As used herein "amino acid" refers to peptide or protein sequences or portions thereof. The terms "protein", "peptide" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably.<br>
Herein, the term "insulin" covers insulin from any species such as porcine insulin, bovine insulin, and human insulin and complexes thereof such as zinc complexes including dimers and oligomers, for example, hexamers thereof. Additionally, the term "insulin" herein covers so-called "insulin analogues". An insulin analogue is an insulin molecule having one or more mutations, substitutions, deletions and/or additions of the A and/or B amino acid chains relative to the native human insulin molecule. More specifically, one or more of the amino acid residues may have been exchanged with another amino acid residue and/or one or more amino acid residue may have been deleted and/or one or two amino acid residues may have been added, with the provision that said insulin analog has a sufficient insulin activity. The insulin analogs are preferably such wherein one or more of the naturally occurring amino acid residues, preferably one, two, or three of them, have been substituted by another codable amino acid residue. Examples of insulin analogues are described in the following patents and equivalents thereto: US 5,618,913, EP 254,516, EP 280,534. US 5,750.497 and US 6,01 1 ,007.

X is a polypeptide that connects the A chain to the B chain which can be cleaved enzymatically without disrupting either the A chain or the B chain bearing at least two amino acids wherein the first and the last amino acid is Lysine or arginine.<br>
One of the aspect of the instant invention specifically relates to the molecule IN-105. IN-105 is an insulin molecule conjugated at the epsilon amino acid Lysine at position B29 of the insulin B-chain with an ampiphilic oligomer of structural formula CH30-(C4H20)3-CH2-CH2-COOH.The molecule may be monoconjugated at At, Bl and<br><br>

Trypsin is a typical serine protease and hydrolyzes a protein or a peptide at the carboxyl terminal of an arginine or lysine residue {Enzymes, pp 261-262(1979), ed. Dixon, M. &amp; Webb, E. C, Longman Group Ltd., London). In particular, facile hydrolysis occurs at a dibasic site where two successive arginine or lysine residues exist, and it is known that hydrolysis occurs most readily where the dibasic site is located in or next to a P-turn structure (Rholam, M., et al., FLBS Lett.. 207, I-6(1986).The Enzyme Vol. II. 3rd Edition, Editor Boyer, Acad. Press NY. Pp. 249-275). Particularly, trypsin cleaves peptide bonds at C-terminal arginine (Arg) or lysine (Lys) residues. Tryptic cleavage of insulin precursor molecules can occur at different cleavage sites simultaneously. Because of the many cleavage sides within a specific insulin precursor molecule, many undesired side-products can be formed during tryptic cleavage reaction.<br><br>
Kccombmant porcine pancreatic trypsin has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons and an enzymatic activity optimum at pH 8.0. Trypsin is used in the industrial process of producing insulin and insulin analogs. The production of these biomoleeules is described in the literature and several approaches have been chosen.<br>
Carboxypeptidase B preferentially hydrolyzes the basic amino acids lysine, arginine and ornithine from the C-terminal position of polypeptides. Carboxypeptidase B is an exopeptidase catalyzing a hydrolytic release of the C-terminal basic amino acid residues of arginine and lysine from peptides and proteins.<br>
The term "C-peptide" or "linker peptide" as used herein includes all forms of insulin C-peptide, including native or synthetic peptides. Such insulin C-peptides may be human peptides, or may be from other animal species and genera, preferably mammals. Thus variants and modifications of native insulin C-peptide are included as long as they retain insulin C-peptide activity. It is known in the art to modify the sequences of proteins or peptides, whilst retaining their useful activity and this may be achieved using techniques which are standard in the art and widely described in the literature e.g. random or site-directed mutagenesis, cleavage and ligation of nucleic acids etc. Thus, functionally equivalent variants or derivatives of native insulin C-peptide sequences may readily be prepared according to techniques well known in the art, and include peptide sequences having a functional, e.g. a biological, activity of a native insulin C-peptide. All such analogues, variants, derivatives or fragments of insulin C-pepiide are especially included in the scope of this invention, and are subsumed under the term "an insulin C-peptide".<br>
The main requirements of a C-peptide are that they be of sufficient length to permit a di-sulphide bond formation between the A- and B-chains and they can be cleavable from the insulin precursor leading to insulin formation. A typical di-peptide used as a C-peptide is -Arg-Arg-. C-peptides may be of any length which start with Arg or Lys and end with Arg or lys.<br>
The invention provides vectors comprising DNA encoding any of the herein described genes. Host cell comprising any such vectors are also provided. By way of example, the host cells may be bacterial, fungal, or mammalian.<br><br>
The invention employs a recombinant host cell in which at least a portion of a nucleic acid sequence expressing the insulin compound precursor is produced. A recombinant expression system is selected from prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. Euukaryotic hosts include yeast cells (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris), mammalian cells or plant cells. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells are available from a number of different sources including commercial sources to those skilled in the art, e.g., the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, Md.). Commercial sources of cells used for recombinant protein expression also provide instructions for usage of the cells. The choice of the expression system depends on the features desired for the expressed polypeptide.<br>
Most preferably related to aspects to the present inventions, the most preferred host cells are methylotrophic yeasts. Strains of a mcthylotrophic yeast which can be modified using the present invention include, but are not limited to, yeast strains capable of growing on methanol, such as yeasts of the genera Pichia, Candida.

EXAMPLE 3A:<br>
Enzyme reactions<br>
Different Insulin compounds can be prepared from their corresponding precursor through an enzymatic conversion. Direct conversion from the precursor to the final product can be obtained by the presence of two protease enzymes. The enzyme reactions were carried out in two different ways. 1st the precursor has to be treated with trypsin or trypsin-like enzymes of plant, animal or microbial recombinant origin. When the Trypsin reaction is over the intermediate in the same reaction mixtures were treated with the 2nd protease enzyme Carboxypeptidase B or similar enzyme of plant, animal, microbial recombinant origin. Carboxypeptoidase B can act on the basic amino acid in the C-terminal end. Alternatively, the Trypsin and Carboxypeptidase enzymes were added in the reaction mixture as a cocktail (together) and the reactions were allowed to continue till the optimum corresponding product formation happened.<br>
EXAMPLE 4A:<br>
When only Trypsin was added to the individual precursor reaction mixture.<br>
2gm of individual Aspart, Lispro and Glulisine precursor crystals were solubilized with 5ml of 6M TRIS solution. Product concentration of the individual reaction mixture was kept as 3-5 mg/ml. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8.5. Trypsin was added to the individual reaction mixture at a concentration of 50ng/ml. The reactions were carried out at both 4±0.5 DC and room temperature (24 ±0.5 °C). it was observed<br><br>
the chromatographic profile at the end of the reaction mixture does not change with respect to reaction temperature but the time for completion of the reaction decreases as the temperature increases. The temperature for the reactions was kept at 24 ±0.5 °C. The reactions were continued for 8hr and at the end of 8hr the samples were analyzed.<br>
Similar way the individual precursor of Aspart, Lispro and Glulisine were solubilized in Tris solution and 50% of solvent Dimethyl Formamidc at concentration of 3-5mg/ml. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8.5 and the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at 24 ±0.5 °C. Trypsin was added to the individual reaction mixture at a concentration of 50u.g/ml.<br>
Observation:<br>
Aspart precursor has been converted to B-30 Des-Threonine Aspart and Des Octapeptide Insulin. Percentage of Des threonine Aspart was 45%, desoctapeptide Insulin was 36%. The formation of required intermediate, Aspart with extra Arginine residue in the B31 position, is around 10-14%. Thus even the 2nd enzyme Carboxypeptidase B be added to the reaction mixture, overall yield for making the final product would be 
Similar product profile was found when the reaction was carried out with 50% solvent. But the reaction rate is very slow in presence of solvent. To achieve the similar type of profile the reactions has to continue for almost 18hrs.<br>
Thus the generation of Aspart from the corresponding precursor through the successive protease reaction could not be possible. Thus it was understood that B-29Lys of Aspart is the most potent site for Trypsin cleavage and as the reaction continues, B-22Arg site are also become prone for Trypsin cleavage and at the end of (he reaction we get a mixed population of B-30 des Threonine and Des-Octapeptide in each individual precursor. The cleavage product at B-31 Arginine is very low in all of the precursor product.<br>
Lispro precursor, under similar condition, was converted to Lispro product with extra Arginine residue in the B3 1 position along with high amount of Des- octapeptide Insulin. Similar type of observation was found when Glulisine Precursor was treated<br><br>
with Trypsin under identical conditions. But the chromatographic profiles of the reaction mixture were not clean at all in case of Lispro and Glulisine precursor. This suggest even the possible final product, Lispro and Glulisine, can be made through the successive reaction with the 2nd protease Carboxypeptidase B but the overall yield would be very poor.<br>
Presence of 50% Di-methyl Formamide only slows down the reaction rate in case of Lispro as well as Glulisine precursor.<br>
To check the concept similar type of Trypsin reaction was tried to the IN-105 precursor B-29Lys residue when precursor was blocked in ln-105 precursor by the short chain PEG molecule as well as with the nonconjugated precursor molecule. It was observed that in case of conjugated IN-105 precursor, Trypsin cleaves more preferentially at the c-terminal end of Arginine residue of the 31st amino acid to generate IN-105 with an extra Arginine residue in the C-terminal end of B chain. Along with the B-31 Arginine IN-105 Des Octa Insulin is also generated in this reaction mixture. But when the nonconjugated IN-105 precursor was treated with Trypsin, the protease cleaves preferentially at the C-terminal end B-29 Lysine residue to generate Des-Threonine Insulin. The chromatographic profile at the end of the reaction is same both in presence or absence of any solvent in the reaction mixture. It was observed that presence of solvent slows down the reaction rate.<br>
EXAMPLES 4B:<br>
In the next phase of the experimental conditions, the reactions were carried out by adding Trypsin and Carboxypeptidase B together in the individual precursor reaction mixture.<br>
The concentration of the precursor was generally about 5 to 50 g/L. The reaction was carried out at about pH 5 to 12, preferably about pH 8 to 10. Reaction temperature was about 0-40 °C, preferably about 2-25 °C. Trishydroxylmethylaminomethane (TRIS) or other buffer systems were used at different ionic strengths to maintain the required pH. Reaction time was variable and was affected by other reaction conditions. Reaction was continued until the purity of the product starts decreasing due to the hydrolysis of<br><br>
the product. It takes generally about 30 minutes to 24 hours and in most cases about 4 to 10 hours.<br>
The concentration of enzyme was determined depending on concentration of substrates and enzyme activity. For example, the crystalline trypsin available in the market was used preferably in a concentration about 10 to 100 mg/L.<br>

The reaction was carried out in all the samples by adding trypsin and Carboxypeptidase B together at different concentrations. The different parameters varied are tabulated.<br><br><br><br>
It was observed that when Trypsin and Carboxypeptidase were added together in the reaction mixture, both Des octapeptide form and des-threonine formation was nol observed. At the end of the reaction Aspart is the main product in the reaction. The purity and the yield of the generated Aspart vary in individual reaction condition.
