COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A WATER-SOLUBLE DRY COMPOSITION"<br>
OTSUKA   PHARMACEUTICAL   CO.   LTD.,   a   Japanese   company,   9, Kandatsukasacho 2-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0048, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a water-soluble dry composition<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a fqam inhibitor which effectively inhibits foaming (bubbling) caused when dissolving a dry composition and to a water-soluble dry composition which comprises the foam inhibitor so that foaming (bubbling) is significantly inhibited.<br>
BACKGROUND ART In dry compositions containing pharmacologically active proteinaceous substances as active ingredients, various saccharides including sucrose have conventionally been used as stabilizer for the active ingredients (see Japanese Unexamined Patent,Publications Nos. 92619/1983, 48933/1985 and 138222/1990).<br>
The conventional dry compositions of ; pharmacologically active proteinaceous substances containing saccharides, however, tend to foam severely when dissolved at the time of utilization depending on the amount of saccharides contained therein. The foaming may cause problems such as erroneous assessment or identification of insoluble foreign.matters, introduction of bubbles into a syringe together with solution in preparing an injection solution, a longer time required<br><br>
for the preparation of the solution, etc.<br>
Further, in the case where solutions of medical compositions containing saccharides are freeze-dried, the freeze-dried cakes obtained are prone to shrinkage, resulting in deterioration of appearances of drugs. Moreover, if an excessive amount of saccharides is blended in a preparation, a relatively long time is unavoidably required for the freeze-drying.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>

when dissolving a conventional dry composition containing a saccharide. Another object of the present invention is to provide a dry composition wherein the foaming usually observed at the time of redissolving the dry compositions is effectively inhibited.<br>

Saccharides to be used in the invention are not limited as long as they may typically be employed as stabilizers or the like for the medical compositions which contain pharmacologically active proteinaceous substances, and examples thereof include various saccharides as described above. Preferable saccharides are disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, etc.; among<br><br>
which the sucrose is more preferable. These saccharides are blended with the dry compositions alone, but two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.

Examples of the hydrophobic amino acid include, as described above, those having a hydropathy index of about 2 or larger, preferably of about 2.8 or larger such as valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine; those having a hydropathy index of about 3.8 or larger such as valine, leucine and isoleucine; and those having a hydropathy index of about 3.8-4.5 such as leucine. The hydrophobic amino acids specified above may work as foam inhibitors for saccharides-containing dry compositions. The hydrophobic amino acids may be contained in the dry compositions alone, but two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. In addition, the concentration of the hydrophobic amino acid in the dry composition is not limited, and the examples thereof may be as described above i.e. in the range of 0.05 wt.% to not more than 40 wt.%, preferably about 0.1-30 wt.%, about 0.5-30 wt.% in some cases, about 1-25 wt.% in some cases, and about 2-20 wt.% in some cases.<br>
The concentration of the hydrophobic amino acid<br><br>
per 100 wt.% of the saccharide in the dry composition, as the hydrophobic amino acid, is in the range of usually about "l-l6d" wt.%, preferably about 2-50 vrt."%, ifio"re    "" "" preferably about 3-25 wt.%.<br>
Known materials as stabilizers, etc., such as human serum albumins, polar amino acids having the hydropathy index of not more than 0 (including those in a form of a salt or amide), inorganic salts, gelatins, surfactants, buffers, or the like may be contained in the dry compositions of the invention alone, but two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination for the purposes of stabilizing the solution before drying, stabilizing the dry composition after drying and/or of prevention of the active ingredients from being adsorbed to a vessel, etc.<br>
The human serum albumin is not always necessary in the invention; however, in the case where it is contained in the dry composition, the concentration is in the range of, for example, typically more than 0 and not more than 30 wt.%, not more than 20 wt.% in some cases and not more than 10 wt.% in some cases, based on 100 wt.% of the dry composition.<br>
In the case where the human serum albumin is not added with the dry composition, it is preferable to add at least one species selected from the polar amino acids having hydropathy index of not more than 0 (including<br><br>
those in a form of a salt or an amide), gelatins, surfactants, etc.<br>
Examples of the polar amino acids having" the 	<br>
hydropathy index of not more than 0 include glycine, proline, alanine, arginine, glutamic  acid. These polar amino acids may be used alone, but two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The polar amino acids further include those in the form of a salt or amide. Examples of the salt of the polar amino acid include a salt thereof with an alkali metal such as a sodium, potassium, etc. or with an alkali earth metal such as a calcium, etc.; and an adduct salt thereof with an inorganic acid such as a phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, etc. or with an organic acid such as a sulfonic acid, etc.<br>
Examples of preferable polar amino acids are glycine, proline, arginine, glutamic acid and salts thereof, more specifically, glycine, arginine hydrochloride and sodium glutamate.<br>
The concentration of the polar amino acid is not limited, for example, the range of typically 0.1-50 wt.%, in some cases 0.5-30 wt.%, in some cases 1-20 wt.%, based on 100 wt.% of the dry composition.<br>
As the surfactant, various surfactants utilized in the typical pharmaceutical preparations, such as<br><br>
anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, nonionic surfactants and dipolar surfactants may be used in the present invehtibh. Examples of suitable surfactants include nonionic surfactants such as a<br>
polyoxyethylenesorbitan aliphatic ester (ex. Tween-type surfactants), sorbitantriolate, etc. Herein, the surfactant may be added in the dry composition depending on the kind of pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance in the dry composition, i.e. the surfactant may be unnecessary depending on the kind of pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance in the dry composition. In the case where the surfactant is required, the concentration of the surfactant in the dry composition may be in the range of typically 0.0001-20 wt.%, in some 0.001-10 wt.% cases, and in some cases 0.001-5 wt-%.<br>
Buffers to be used in the invention may be those having the buffer capacity in the range of pH values of pH 6-8, preferably of pH 6.5-8, so that a solution of the dry composition has pH values suitable for injection. Buffers typically used for injection are employed, including organic acid-based and inorganic acid-based buffers. The preferable buffers are organic acid-based buffers such as a citrate buffer.<br>
The dry composition of the invention is prepared by any drying methods (ex. spray drying, lyophilization,<br><br>
etc.) without particular limitations.<br>
Specifically, taking the lyophilization as an example, the dry composition of the present invention can be prepared by dissolving a composition containing at least a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance, saccharide and hydrophobic amino acid at the above-described concentrations into a solution for medical preparation, followed by freeze-drying the solution by the usual lyophilization method.<br>
The water-soluble dry composition of the invention is dissolved at the time of utilization typically by adding water for injection (distilled water or sterilized water) thereto. Foaming is usually caused in the case where conventional dry composition which contains no hydrophobic amino acid is dissolved; however, in the present invention, the foaming is effectively inhibited so that the injection solution of high clarity is prepared. Accordingly, entering of an insoluble foreign matters is assessed without mistake, and, since the foaming is not practically caused, entering of bubbles into a syringe at the time of sucking the solution into the syringe is assuredly prevented.<br>
The shrinkage of freeze-dried cake which is typically caused by the absence of hydrophobic amino acid is effectively suppressed in the present invention even<br><br>
though the water-soluble dry composition is prepared by lyophilization, so that the improvement in appearances of drugs is achlevedr further, bieri(3xng""of amino acid with a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance containing saccharide produce an effect of significantly reducing the time required for freeze-drying compared to the case wherein no hydrophobic amino acid is blended in the preparation of dry composition. This effect is remarkable especially when a disaccharide such as sucrose and a buffer such as a citrate buffer are contained in the preparation.<br>
Consequently, in view of the above-described effects, the preferable water-soluble dry compositions of the invention are the freeze-dried compositions prepared by the lyophilization.<br>

5.	The shelf temperature was elevated up to 40° C expending 30 minuets, followed by a further pressure reduction, and then the conditions were maintained for 2 hours.<br><br>
6. The shelf temperature was reduced to 25°C expending 30 minutes, and then the conditions were maintained for 1 hour tocomplete the freeze-drying.<br>
The appearances of the freeze-dried samples were<br>
observed as well as the formability by dissolving the<br>
samples with 1 ml of the distilled water for injection.<br>
Results are shown in Table 1.<br><table>
<br><br><br>
The shrinkage and foamability were evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:<br>
ShTlrikage: ± freeze-dried cake was very slightly shrinked.-+ freeze-dried cake was slightly shrinked. ++ freeze-dried cake was considerably shrinked. +++ freeze-dried cake was exceedingly shrinked. Foamability: ± very slight foaming. + a slight foaming. ++ considerable foaming . +++ exceeding foaming. As is apparent from Table 1, the foamabilities of the freeze-dried cakes containing sucrose at the time of dissolving were effectively suppressed by using the hydrophobic amino acids having the hydropathy index of not less than 2, and the appearances of the product were considerably improved as a result of suppression of the shrinkage.

Freeze-dried products containing the hydrophobic amino acids obtained in the above Examples 5-109 respectively are capable of effectively suppressing the foamability in redissolving the freeze-dried products and of considerably improving the products" appearances by preventing the freeze-dried cakes from shrinkage.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY According to the present invention, foaming typically caused by dissolving dry compositions containing saccharides are effectively inhibited, thereby enabling to prepare a solution excellent in its clarity- Further, even in the case of employing a lyophilization as the drying method, freeze-dried cakes obtained therein are effectively prevented from shrinkage, giving the dry<br><br>
products excellent in the appearances.<br>
In the dry compositions of the invention, especially in the freeze-dried compositions, the moisture content is satisfactorily reduced in a shorter drying time than that required for the conventional freeze-dried products which do not contain any of the hydrophobic amino acids having the hydropathy index of not less than 2. Accordingly, the time required for lyophilization is reduced in the process for preparation of dry compositions as a whole, which is advantageous in the industrial production.<br><br><br>
