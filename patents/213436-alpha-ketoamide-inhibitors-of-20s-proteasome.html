				<td>TITLE:    -Ketoamide Inhibitors of 20S Proteasome<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The multicatalytic proteinase or the proteasome is a highly conserved cellular structure that is responsible for the ATP-dependent proteolysis of most cellular proteins (Coux, O., Tanaka, K. and Goldberg, A. 1996 Ann.  Rev.  Biochem. 65, 801-847). The 20S proteasome contains the catalytic core of the complex and has been crystallized from the archaebacteria Thermoplasma acidophilum (Lowe, J., Stock, D., Jap, B., Zwicki, P., Bauminster, W. and Huber, R. 1995 Science 268, 533-539) and from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Groll, M., Ditzel, L., Lowe, J., Stock, D., Bochtler, M., Bartunik, HD and Huber, R. 1997 Nature 386, 463-471). Unlike the archaebacterial proteasome that primarily exhibits chymotrypsin like proteolytic activity (Dahlmann, B., Kopp, F., Kuehn, L., Niedel, B., Pfeifer, G. 1989 FEBSLett. 251, 125-131; Seemuller, E., Lupas, A., Zuw, F., Zwickl, P and Baumeister, W. FEBS Lett. 359, 173, (1995) the eukaryotic proteasome contains at least five identifiable proteolytic activities.   Three of these activities are similar in specificity to chymotrypsin, trypsin and  peptidylglutamyl peptidase.    The two other  activities described  exhibit a preference for cleavage of peptide bonds on the carboxyi side of branched chain amino acids (BrAAP) and toward peptide bonds between short chain neutral amino acids (SnAAP) (Orlowski, M. 1990 Biochemistry 29,10289-10297).<br>
Although the 20S proteasome contains the proteolytic core, it cannot degrade proteins in vivo unless it is complexed with a 19S cap, at either end of its structure, which itself contains multiple ATPase activities. This larger structure is known as the 26S proteasome and will rapidly degrade proteins that have been targeted for degradation by the addition of<br><br>
multiple molecules of the 8.5-kDa polypeptide, ubiquitin (reviewed in Coux, O., Tanaka, K. and Goldberg, A. 1996 Ann.Rev. Biochem. 65, 801-847).<br>
A large number of substrate-derived functionalities have been used as potential serine-and thiol protease inhibitors. Several of these motifs have been described as inhibitors to the proteasome. These include the peptide aldehydes (Vinitsky, A., Michaud, C,, Powers, J. and Orlowski,  M.  1992 Biochemistry 31, 9421-9428; Tsubuki, S., Hiroshi, K., Saito, Y., Miyashita,  N.,  Inomata, M.,  and Kawashima,  S.   1993  Biochem.Biophys.Res.Commun. 196,1195-1201; Rock, K,I., Gramm, C, Rothstein, L.,Clark, K.,Stein, R., Dick, L.,Hwang, D. and Goldberg, A.L. (1994) Cell 78, 761-771) N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal (ALLN) and N-aceryl-L-leucinyl-Heucinyl-methional (LLM) with the most potent inhibitor of this type being N-carbobenzoxyl-1-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norvalinal (MG115).   Other reports have described a series of dipeptide inhibitors that have ICS0 values in the 10 to 100 nM range (Iqbal, M, Chatterjee S., Kauer, J.C., Das, M., Messina, P., Freed, B., Biazzo, W and Siman, R. 1995 I-Med.Chem. 38, 2276-2277).  A series of  -ketocarbonyl and boronic ester derived dipeptides (Iqbai, M., Chatterjee, S., Kauer, J.C., Mallamo, J.P., Messina, P.A., Reiboldt, A. and Siman, R. 1996 Bioorg. Med-Chem. Lett 6, 287-290) and epoxyketones (Spattenstein, A., Leban, JJ., Huang, J.J., Reinhardt, K.R., Viveros, O.H., Sigafoos, J. and Crouch, R. 1996 Tet. Lett. 37,1434-1346) have also been described that are potent inhibitors of the proteasome.<br>
A different compound that exhibits specificity in inhibiting proteasome activity is Lactacystin (Fenteany, G., Standaert, R.F., Lane, W.S., Choi, S., Corey, E.J. and Schreiber, S.L. 1995 Science 268, 726-731) which is a Streptomyces metabolite. This molecule was originally discovered for its ability to induce neurite outgrowth in a neuroblastoma cell line (Omura, S., Matsuzaki, K., Fujirnoto, T., Kosuge, K., Furuya, T., Fujita, S. and Nakagawa, A. 1991 J.Antibiot. 44, 117-118) and later was shown to inhibit the proliferation of several cell<br><br>
types (Fenteany, G., Standaert, R.F., Reichard, G.A., Corey, EJ. and Schreiber, S.L.1994 Proc.Nat'l. Acad.Sci USA 91,3358-3362).<br>
It is now well established that the proteasome is a major extralysosomal proteolytic system involved in the proteolytic pathways essential for diverse cellular functions such as cell division, antigen processing and the degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins such as oncogene products, cyclins and transcription factors (Ciechanover, A. (1994) Cell 79, 13-21;Palombell,V.J., Rando, O.J., Goldberg, A.L. and Maniatis, T. 1994 Cell 78, 773-785). For example, the active form of NF-KB is a heterodimer consisting of a p65 and a p50 subunit. The latter is present in the cytrisol as an inactive precursor (pl05). The proteolytic processing of pl05  to  generate p50 occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.    Additionally, processed p50 and p65 are maintained in the cytosol as an inactive complex bound to the inhibitory protein IKB.  Inflammatory stimuli such as LPS activate NF-KB by initiating the signalling pathway which leads to the degradation of IKB.  These signals also stimulate the processing of pl05 into p50.  Thus two proteolytic events, both governed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, are required for signal induced activation of NF-KB.<br>
The observation that ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal proteolysis plays a critical role in the activation of NF-KB could be exploited clinically by the use of inhibitors directed toward the proteasome. Abnormal activation of NF-KB followed by the stimulation of cytokine synthesis has been observed in a variety of inflammatory and infectious diseases. Activation of NF-KB is also essential for angiogenesis and for expression of adhesion molecules (CAMs and selects), thus proteasome inhibitors may also have utility in the treatment of diseases associated with the vascular system.<br>
It is well documented that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is critical for the regulated destruction of cyclins that govern the exit from mitosis and allow cells to progress into the next phase of the cell cycle (Glotzer, M., Murray, A.W. and Kirschner, M.W. (1991)<br>
3<br><br>
Nature 349, 132-138). Thus, inhibiting the degradation of cyclins by using protcasome inhibitors causes growth arrest. Therefore another potential utility of proteasome inhibitors is their use in the treatment of diseases that result from abberrant cell division.<br>
Several classes of peptidic inhibitors of 20S proteasome have been reported in the recent literature. The  -ketoamide group has been used in protease inhibitors for numerous indications. Specifically, a series of a-ketocarbonyl and boronic ester derived dipeptides (Iqbal, M., Chatterjee, S., Kauer, J.C., Maliamo, J.P., Messina, P.A., Reiboldt, A. and Siman, R. 1996 Bioorg. Med.Chem. Lett 6, 287-290) have been reported as potent inhibitors of 20S proteasomal function. Derivatives of 3-indolepyruvic acid, have been claimed as pharmaceutically active compounds for the treatment of disturbances of the central nervous system (De Luca, et al WO 88/09789) through a mechanism that modulates kynurenic acid levels in the brain.<br>
Even though various compositions have been discovered that inhibit cell proliferation to some degree, there remains a need for more potent compounds that inhibit cell proliferation via the 20S proteasome.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
The compounds useful in the therapeutic method of this invention are prepared by conventional methods of organic chemisiry. References that may be consulted in describing the art of the synthesis of these compounds include Bodansky's "The Practice of Peptide Synthesis," Springer-Verlag, First Edition, 1984; "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis," Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991. All peptide couplings are accomplished at room temperature with gentle and constant agitation. Peptide couplings and deprotections are monitored using the Kaiser test for amines. Xaa refers to any of the commerically available amino acids that may be purchased pre-attached to the MBHA resin. Yaa and Zaa refer to any of the commerically available amino acids.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) in the general procedure that follows: Xaa-MBHA-resin is weighed and transferred to a syringe equipped with a fritted filter.   The resin is pre-swollen in DMF and then the N-terminal protecting group is removed by treatment with 30%, piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes.   The deprotection solution is removed.  The deprotected resin is washed five times with DMF, five times with MeOH, and Ihen five times with DMF. Amino acid Yaa may then be coupled to the deprotected resin using a solution of Yaa in DMF containing 3 equivalents each of Yaa, carbodiimide coupling reagent and HOBT (hydroxy benzotriazole).  Succesive couplings with solutions of Yaa may be necessary to achieve coupling efficiencies that pass the Kaiser test. The N-terminal group deprotection and Yaa coupling step may be repeated to couple a third amino acid Zaa.   The final coupling step uses ketoacid, carbodiimide, and HOBT in DMF, and this step is repeated until the coupling passes the Kaiser test.   The completed peptide sequence on resin is dried under vaccuum for at least six hours and then cleaved by treatment for 2.5 hours with either 95/5 trifluoroacen'c acid/water or a freshly prepared solution of 90%, trifluoroacetic acid, 3% ethanedithiol, 5% thioanisole, and 2%<br>
40<br><br>
anisole. The cleaved products are recovered by either lyophillization from water or trituration<br>
from diethyl ether. Product purities are estimated from TLC. Selected peptide samples are<br>
checked	by	'H	NMR	to	confirm	product	identity.<br>
41<br><br>
Example 2<br>
In this Example (3'-Indolepyruvic acid)- N-biphenylalanine-D-Leu-Asp-OH was prepared according to the method of Example 1.<br>
Fmoc-N-Asp(0/-Bu)-MBHA-resin (20 mg) is weighed and transferred to a syringe equipped with a fritted filter.  The resin is pre-swollen in 1 mL DMF for 30 minutes.   The Fmoc (fluorcnylmethyloxycarbonyi) protecting group is removed by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes.  The deprotection solution is removed.  The deprotected resin is washed five times with DMF, rive times with MeOH, and then five times with DMF. Fmoc-D-Leu-OH is coupled to the deprotected resin (leq) using a solution of Fmoc-D-Leu-OH (3 eq) in 1 mL DMF containing carbodiimide (3 eq) and HOBT (hydroxy benzotriazole) (3 eq).   A second or third coupling with solutions of Fmoc-D-Leu-OH may be necessary to achieve coupling efficiencies that pass the Kaiser test. The Fmoc deprotection and amino acid coupling step are repeated to couple Fmoc-N- (4,4-biphenyl)alanine. The final coupling step uses indolepyruvic acid (5eq), diisopropylcarbodiimide (5eq), and HOBT (5eq) in DMF, and this step is repeated until the coupling passes the Kaiser test. The completed peptide sequence on resin is dried under vacuum for at least six hours and then cleaved by treatment for 2.5 hours with 1 mL of either 95/5 trifluoroacetic acid/water or a freshly prepared solution of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, and 2% anisole. The cleaved products are recovered by either lyophillization from water or trituration from diethyl ether. Product purities are estimated from TLC.<br>

Example 3<br>
In this example, (3'-Indolepyruvic acid)-N-biphenylalaanine-D-Leu-Asp-OH was prepared using Chiron Mimotopes Pin Technology<br>
The first amino acid residue Xaa is attached to 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenoxyacetamido handle) resin pins (5.7 umole/pin) by coupling each pin in 800 uL of coupling solution (100 mM amino acid, 100 mM DIC, 10 mM DMAP, 1/4 DMF/CHiCy for two hours. The pins are then rinsed with a 5 min DMF wash, two 5 min MeOH washes, and 15 minutes of air drying. Deprotection of the Fmoc group is carried out for 30 min with 800 uL 20% piperidine in DMF.  Repeat pin washings (1 DMF wash, 2 MEOH washes, 15 minutes air drying).  The second amino acid residue Yaa was coupled (100 mM Yaa, 100 mM DIC, 100 mM HOBT, and bromophenol blue indicator in DMF) until the blue color no longer adheres to the pin surface.   The coupling was repeated as necessary.   The rinse cycle and Fmoc deprotection washes were then repeated as well. The next amino acid, Zaa, was coupled by repeating the coupling and washing procedures for coupling Yaa, repeating the coupling if necessary.  The last residue, indolepyruvic acid is coupled with 15 eq, 100 mM, 15 eq DIC, 15 eq HOBT, and bromophenol blue indicator in DMF.  Repeat coupling if necessary. After the last wash, the orange pins were removed from their supports and cleaved in individual 2 mL plastic centrifuge tubes with 1.5 mL of a freshly prepared solution of 90%, trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, and 2% anisole for 2.5 hours. The pins were removed from the tubes and the mixture was blown to near dryness under a nitrogen stream. Triturate with E^O and spin down each tube.   This step was repeated three times per tube.   The precipitated peptides were collected, Iyophillized, weighed, and used.   Product purity was estimated by TLC.   Initial products were cospotted and checked against authentic samples obtained in Example 1.<br>
