(Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a motor-assisted bicycle including a body frame, a head pipe provided at the front end of the body frame, a front basket mounted on the head pipe, an electric motor mounted on the B frame for<br>
t<br>
assisting a depression force applied to crank pedals, and a battery mounted OIL the body frame for supplying electric power to the electric motor, the battery including a battery case and a cell assembly accommodated in the battery case, and more particularly to a battery mounting structure in such a motor-assisted bicycle. <br>
[0002] . (Prior Art]<br>
Such a motor-assisted bicycle is well known in the art, e.g., in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 7-95744.<br>
r-<br>
[000 3] (Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the prior art motor-assisted bicycle mentioned above, a battery is accommodated in a storage box fixedly located behind a seat post present below a seat. Accordingly, in removing the battery from the storage box to charge the battery or in storing the battery into the storage box after charging the battery, the seat must be rotated so as not to hinder the work of removing or storing the battery.  Thus, it is hard to say that such a prior art battery mounting structure is excellent in workability. [0004]<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a battery mounting structure in a motor-assisted bicycle which can make a battery mounting, demounting operation very easy. â€“<br>
(0005] [Means of Solving the Problem]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 1, there is provided in a motor-assisted bicycle including a body frame, a head pipe provided at the front end of said body frame, a front basket mounted on said head pipe, an electric motor mounted on said body frame for assisting a depression force applied to crank pedals, and a battery mounted on said body frame for supplying electric power to said electric motor; a battery mounting structure<br>
characterized in that a battery mounting portion is provided at a rear portion of said front basket to allow mounting and demounting of said battery from a mount opening exposed into said front basket and also allow the battery to be fixedly mounted, and in that said battery mounting portion is provided with terminals adapted to be electrically connected to contacts of said battery in response to mounting of said battery into said battery mounting portion. [0005]<br>
With this arrangement, the need for any extra operation such as rotation of the seat post can be eliminated, and the battery can be easily mounted into and demounted from the battery mounting portion by a very simple operation similar to aloading/unloading operation for a baggage into/from the front basket irrespective of the position of the bar handle.  Further, electrical connection between the battery and the battery mounting portion can be easily made in response to mounting of the battery into the battery mounting portion.  Further, even if the battery is inadvertently dropped in the mounting or demounting operation, the battery can be received by the front basket, so that there is no possibility of damage to the battery. Additionally, since the battery mounting<br>
portion is not present inside the front basket, a baggage storage space of the front basket is not sacrificed by the battery mounting portion. <br>
[0006]According to the invention as defined in claim 2, a lock mechanism for fixedly maintaining a mounted condition of said battery in said battery mounting portion is provided between said battery and said battery mounting portion, and an operating portion for performing locking and unlocking operations of said lock mechanism is provided on one of the right and left sides of said battery mounting portion.  Accordingly, the locking and unlocking operations of the lock mechanism can be easily performed without hindrance by brake cables extending behind the front basket. [0007]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 3, said lock mechanism comprises a first engaging member adapted to disengageably engage one of the right and left side portions of said battery according to the locking operation of said operating portion and a second engaging member stored in said battery and adapted to disengageably engage the other of the right and left side portions of said battery mounting portion in response to the movement<br>
of said first engaging member.  Accordingly, the right and left side portions of the battery are engaged with the right and left side portions of the battery mounting portions, respectively, by operating the operating portion located on the right or left side of the battery mounting portion, thereby allowing reliable mounting of the battery in the battery mounting portion. [0008]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 4, said second engaging member is a rodlike member extending over the substantially entire length between the right and left side portions of said battery and axially movably supported to said battery.  Accordingly, the configuration of the lock mechanism can be simplified. [0009]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 5, there is provided in a motor-assisted bicycle including a body frame, a "head pipe provided at the front end of said body frame, a front basket mounted on said head pipe, an electric motor mounted on said body frame for assisting a depression force applied to crank pedals, and a battery mounted on said body frame for supplying electric power to said electric motor; a battery mounting structure characterized in that a battery mounting portion adapted to<br>
detachably support said battery is fixedly provided in a rear portion of said front basket, in that a lid adapted to cover said battery supported on said battery mounting portion from the front side is connected to a lower portion of said battery mounting portion so as to be pivotable frontward and rearward in said front basket, and in that said battery mounting portion is provided with terminals adapted to be electrically connected to contacts of said battery in response to mounting of said battery to said battery mounting portion. [0010]<br>
With this arrangement, the need for any extra operation such as rotation of the seat post can be eliminated, and the battery can be easily mounted to and demounted from the battery mounting portion by such a very simple operation as to only swing the lid frontward and rearward as similar to a loading/unloading operation for a baggage into/from the front basket, irrespective of the position of the bar handle.  Further, electrical connection between the battery and the battery mounting portion can be easily made in response to mounting of the battery to the battery mounting portion.  Further, even if the battery is inadvertently dropped in the mounting or demounting operation to or from the battery mounting portion, the<br>
battery can be received by the front basket, so that there is no possibility of damage to the battery. [0012]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 6, a lock mechanism for fixedly maintaining a closed condition of said lid is operatively provided between an upper portion of said battery mounting portion and an upper portion of said lid on a longitudinal center line of said body frame.  Accordingly, the locking and unlocking operations of the lock ir*echanism can be easily performed without hindrance by brake cables extending behind the front basket.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a A motor-assisted bicycle having a body frame, a head pipe provided at the front end of said body frame, a front basket mounted on said head pipe, an electric motor mounted on said body frame for assisting a depression force applied to crank pedals, and a battery mounted on said body frame for supplying electric power to said electric motor; a battery mounting structure characterized in that a battery mounting portion is provided at a rear portion of said front basket for mounting and demounting of said battery from a mount opening exposed into said front basket and also allow the battery to be fixedly mounted, wherein said battery mounting portion is provided with terminals electrically connected to contacts of said battery in response to mounting of said battery into said battery mounting portion.<br><br>

*<br>
In relation therewith, an elastic biasing mechanism 151 is provided on the mounting plate 46e of the support frame 46, so as to facilitate demounting of the battery 40i from the<br>
of the battery case 62, a front guide portion 88b slightly raised from the front end of the plate portion 88a and adapted to come into contact with a lower portion of the front surface of the battery case 62, a rear guide portion 88c raised from the rear end of the plate portion 88a up to a position higher than the top position of the front guide portion 88b along the lower vertical support bar 46c of the support frame 46 and adapted to come into contact with a lower portion of the guide 62b of the battery case 62, and a terminal support portion 88d contiguous to a longitudinally central portion of the lower surface of the plate portion 88a and extending downward so as to pass through a hole 71 formed through the support plate 46f. Thus, the terminal box 88 is secured to the support plate 46f.<br>
[0031]Referring also to FIG. 12, the battery case 62 of the battery 40i is mounted on the battery mounting portion 39i in such a manner that the front and rear lower ends of the battery case 62 are guided by the front guide portion 88b and the rear guide portion 88c of the terminal box 88.<br>

In relation therewith, an elastic biasing mechanism 151 is provided on the mounting plate 46e of the support frame 46, so as to facilitate demounting of the battery 40i from the<br>
mount opening 48 by biasing the battery case 62 supported at its lower end portion by the front guide portion 88b and the rear guide portion 88c in such a direction that the front end portion of the battery case 62 is tilted frontward. [0032]<br>
The elastic biasing mechanism 151 includes a support shaft 152 having an axis extending substantially horizontally in the lateral direction of the body frame 21 and provided between the opposed side walls of the mounting plate 46e, an arm 153 having a front end portion 153a allowed to project frontward from the opening 47 and pivotably supported at a base end portion to the support shaft 152, and a spring 154 provided between the base end portion of the arm 153 and the mounting plate 46e so as to apply to the arm 153 a rotational biasing force in such a direction that the front end portion 153a of the arm 153 frontward urges the battery case 62 of the battery 40i. [0033]<br>
The arm 153 is formed in a substantially U-shaped configuration as having the front end portion 153a which is a rod portion parallel to the support shaft 152.  The front end portion 153a of the arm 153 is adapted to come into contact with the guide 62b of the battery case 62 of the<br>
battery 40i at a portion over the stopper 62c.  In the condition that the battery case 62 of the battery 40i is mounted in the battery mounting portion 39lf the front end portion 153a of the arm 153 is in- contact with the upper surface of the stopper 62c of the battery case 62, so that the lower portion of the battery case 62 is held between the front end portion 153a of the arm 153 and the plate portion 88a of the terminal box 88.  Accordingly, vibrations of the battery 40i in the battery mounting portion 39i during running of the vehicle can be prevented, and stable connection between the battery 40X and discharge terminals 89 and 90 to be hereinafter described can be maintained. [0035]<br>
Furthermore, a lock mechanism 155! is provided between the battery 40! and the battery mounting portion 39i to fixedly maintain the mounted condition of the battery 40! in the battery mounting portion 39X. [0036]The lock mechanism 155: includes an operating portion 156 mounted on the outer side surface of one of the two upper side walls 52 of the battery mounting portion 39X, e.g., on the outer side surface of the right upper side wall 52 with respect to the frontward direction of the<br>
vehicle, for allowing locking and unlocking operations of the lock mechanism 155X, a first engaging member 157 adapted to disengageably engage the battery case 62 on the right side of the battery 40j in response to the operation of the operating portion 156 by means of a key 159, and a second engaging member 158 accommodated in the battery case 62 of the battery 40i and adapted to disengageably engage the left upper side wall 52 of the battery mounting portion 392 in response to the movement of the first engaging member 157.<br>
[0037]The operating portion 156 has an upper opening key hole 160 for allowing insertion of the key 159, and is fixedly mounted on the right upper side wall 52.  The first engaging member 157 is a rodlike member having a base end portion received in the operating portion 156.  The operating portion 156 incorporates a mechanism for operating the first engaging member 157 in its axial direction in response to the operation of the key 159 inserted into the key hole 160.  That is, the right side portion of the battery case 62 is formed with an engagement<br>
*<br>
hole 161, and the first engaging member 157 is operated between a position where its front end portion is inserted through the engagement hole 161 to thereby engage the right<br>
side portion of the battery case 62 and a position where the front end portion is disengaged from the engagement hole 161 to thereby release the engagement with the battery case 62. - [0038]<br>
The second engaging member 158 is a rodlike member extending over the substantially entire length between the right and left side portions of the battery case 62 of the battery 40!, and is axially movably supported to the battery case 62.  One end of the second engaging member 158 is abuttable against the front end of the first engaging member 157 in coaxial relationship with each other. The left side portion of the battery case 62 is formed with a through hole 162 for allowing insertion of the other end of the second engaging member 158, and the left upper side wall 52 of the battery mounting portion 39i is formed with an engagement hole 163 aligned with the through hole 162. Further, a collar 158a is provided at an intermediate portion of the second engaging member 158, and a spring seat 164 is provided in the battery case 62 at a position spaced from the collar 158a toward the other end of the<br>
*<br>
second engaging member 158.  A coil spring 165 surrounding the second engaging member 158 is provided between the collar 158a and the spring seat 164 to bias the second<br>
engaging member 158 in such a direction that its one end abuts against the front end of the first engaging member 157.  Further, a stopper 166 is provided in the battery case 62 at a position opposed to -the collar 158a on the first engaging member 157 side along the axial direction of the second engaging member 158.  The collar 158a is adapted to come into abutment against the stopper 166 by a biasing force of the spring 165, thereby limiting the axial movement of the second engaging member 158 toward the first engaging member 157. [0039]<br>
According to the lock mechanism 155lf by operating the operating portion 156 with the key 159 in the condition where the battery 40: is mounted in the battery mounting portion 39i, the first engaging member 157 is inserted into the engagement hole 161, thereby engaging the right side portion of the battery case 62, and in response to this movement of the first engaging member 157 the second engaging member 158 is inserted into the engagement hole 163, thereby engaging the left side portion of the battery mounting portion 39j.  Thus, the mounted condition of the battery 40i in the battery mounting portion 39j is fixedly maintained.  Conversely, when the first engaging member 157 is retracted toward the operating portion 156 by operating<br>
the operating portion 156 with the key 159, the first engaging member 157 is disengaged from the engagement hole 161, thereby releasing the engagement with the battery case 62, and in response thereto the second engaging member 158 is axially moved toward the first engaging member 157 by the biasing force of the spring 165, thereby disengaging from the engagement hole 163 and releasing the engagement with the battery mounting portion 39l.  At this time, one end of the second engaging member 158 is inhibited from projecting from the engagement hole 161, and the other end of the second engaging member 158 is also inhibited, from projecting from the through hole 162 by means of the stopper 166.  Accordingly, the battery 40i is biased frontward by the elastic biasing mechanism 151, thereby facilitating removal of the battery 40j from the mount opening 48. [0040]<br>
The battery mounting portion 39i is covered on its rear side and right and left sides with a rear cover 168 formed of a synthetic resin.  The rear cover 168 is secured by screws 169 to the stays 53 mounted on the lateral support bar 46a of the support frame 46 and is also secured by screws 170 to the rear walls 50 of the front basket 38^ The rear cover 168 is formed at its portion covering the<br>
operating portion 156 of the lock mechanism I55i with a circular opening 171 to which the upper surface of the operating portion 156 is exposed, so as to allow the key<br>
159	to be inserted from the upper- side into the key hole<br>
160	formed on the upper surface of the operating portion<br>
156.  Further, the rear cover 168 is integrally formed at<br>
its lower portion with a pair of extended cover portions<br>
168a extending downward to cover the terminal box 88 on its<br>
right and left sides, so that the terminal box 88 provided<br>
at the lower end of the battery mounting portion 39i is<br>
almost concealed on the right and left sides to thereby<br>
provide an aesthetic design.<br>
[0041]Referring also to FIG. 13, the battery 40i is provided with first, second, and third connection terminals 75, 76, and 77.  The first connection terminal 75 is connected through a shunt resistor 66 to the negative terminal of the cell assembly 61.  The second connection terminal 76 is connected to the positive terminal of the cell assembly 61.  The third connection terminal 77 is connected through a thermistor 78 for detection of the temperature of the cell assembly 61 to the negative terminal of the cell assembly 61. [0042]<br>
As previously mentioned, the guide 62b is provided on the rear surface of the battery case 62, that is, of the rear case half 64 of the battery case 62 of the battery 40x at its laterally central portion so as to extend vertically and project rearward.  Further, the recess 62a is formed on the bottom of the battery case 62 at its laterally central portion.  The connection terminals 75, 76, and 77 are provided in the battery case 62 at a corner portion between the guide 62b and the recess 62a. [0043]<br>
The first connection terminal 75 has a flat terminal plate 80 fixed at its front end and resiliently abutting against the inner surface of the bottom of the battery case 62, a discharge contact 75a riveted to the lower surface of the terminal plate 80, and a platelike charge contact 75b contiguous to the rear end of the terminal plate 80 at substantially right angles thereto and resiliently abutting against the inner surface of the rear portion of the battery case 62.  Thus, the first connection terminal 75 is relatively widely formed in a substantially L-shaped configuration.  The discharge contact 75a is a silver contact, and the charge contact 75b is plated with nickel (or silver). [0044]<br>
The first connection terminal 75 is located at a position corresponding to one lateral side portion of the guide 62b.  The bottom wall of the battery case 62 is formed with a circular opening 81- for exposing the discharge contact 75a, and the guide 62b is formed with a vertically elongated slit 82 closed at its upper end and open at its lower end, for exposing the charge contact 75b. [0045]<br>
The second connection terminal 76 has a discharge contact 76a and a charge contact 76b, and is formed in a substantially L-shaped configuration like the first connection terminal 75.  However, the second connection terminal 76 is narrower than the first connection terminal 75.  The second connection terminal 76 is located at a position corresponding to the other lateral side portion of the guide 62b.  The bottom wall of the battery case 62 is formed with a circular opening (not shown) for exposing the discharge contact 76a, and the guide 62b is formed with a vertically elongated slit 83 closed at its upper end and open at its lower end, for exposing the charge contact 76b. [0046]<br>
The third connection terminal 77 is formed in a substantially L-shaped configuration like the first connection terminal 75 and the second connection terminal<br>
76.  However, the third connection terminal 77 has no contact exposed to the bottom outer surface of the battery case 62.  The third connection terminal 77 is located in the battery case 62 at a position between the first connection terminal 75 and the second connection terminal 76.  The guide 62b is formed with a vertically elongated slit 84 closed at its upper end and open at its lower end, for exposing the third connection terminal 77. [0047]Further, the guide 62b is formed with two<br>
vertically elongated guide grooves 85 closed at their upper ends and open at their lower ends at positions between the slits 82 and 84 and between the slits 83 and 84.<br>
[0048]On the other hand, the terminal support portion 88d of the terminal box 88 is provided with a first discharge terminal 89 adapted to be connected to the discharge contact 75a of the first connection terminal 75 in the battery 40j mounted in the battery mounting portion 39i and a second discharge terminal 90 adapted to be connected to the discharge contact 76a of the second connection terminal 76 in the battery 40j mounted in the battery mounting portion 3 9^ â€”[0049]<br>
The plate portion 88a and the terminal support portion 88d of the terminal box 88 is formed with a mounting hole 91 closed at its lower end and open at its upper end so as to correspond to the opening 81 formed through the bottom wall of the battery case 62 to expose the discharge contact 75a of the first connection terminal 75.  The first discharge terminal 89 is a rodlike member located in the mounting hole 91 in coaxial relationship therewith and axially movably passed through the closed bottom of the mounting hole 91.  Further, a retainer 92 slidably engaged within the mounting hole 91 is fixed to the first discharge terminal 89 at its intermediate portion. A spring 94 is interposed under compression between the retainer 92 and a washer 93 disposed on the inner surface of the closed bottom of the mounting hole 91. With this arrangement, the first discharge terminal 89 is biased by the spring 94 in such a direction that the upper end of the first discharge terminal 89 comes into pressure contact with the discharge contact 85a of the first connection terminal 75.  Further, a stop ring 95 is fixedly engaged with a lower end portion of the first discharge terminal 89 and adapted to come into abutment against the outer surface of the closed bottom of the mounting hole 91 by a biasing force of the spring 94, thereby limiting<br><br>
upward movement of the first discharge terminal 89. [0050]<br>
According to such a mounting structure of the first discharge terminal 89 in the terminal box 88, the upper end of the first discharge terminal 89 comes into resilient abutment against the discharge contact 75a of the first connection terminal 75 when the battery 40a is mounted into the battery mounting portion 39i.  Accordingly, the connection of the discharge contact 75a and the first discharge terminal 89 can be effectively maintained against vibrations of the battery 40i during running of the vehicle. [0051]<br>
The second discharge terminal 90 is also provided in the terminal box 88 in a mounting structure similar to that of the first discharge terminal 89, so that when the battery 40i is mounted into the battery mounting portion 39i, the upper end of the second discharge terminal 90 comes into resilient abutment against the discharge contact 76a of the second connection terminal 76.  Accordingly, the connection of the discharge contact 76a and the second discharge terminal 90 can be effectively maintained against vibrations of the battery 40: during running of the vehicle.<br>
[0052]The first and second discharge terminals 89 and 90 are connected to cords 96 and 97 for supplying electric power to the electric motor 30, respectively.  The cords 96 and 97 are drawn from the terminal box 88. [0053]<br>
Referring to FIGS. 14 to 16, reference numeral 100 generally designates a charger for charging the battery 40i demounted from the battery mounting portion 39i. The charger 100 is so designed as to vertically receive the battery 40^ [0054]<br>
The charger 100 has a housing 101 adapted to be placed on a flat floor surface 99.  The housing 101 has a low-level portion 102 having a relatively low level from the floor surface 99 and a high-level portion 103 having a level from the floor surface 99 higher than the level of the low-level portion 102 and contiguous to the low-level portion 102.  The housing 101 is formed of a synthetic resin and has a substantially rectangular boxlike shape as viewed in plan with a width smaller than the width of the battery 40^ [0055]<br>
The high-level portion 103 is formed with a<br>
mounting groove 107 open on its upper side and right and left sides.  That is, the mounting groove 107 is defined by a vertically extending side surface 104 formed on the low-level portion 102 side, a vertically extending side surface 105 opposed to the side surface 104, and a horizontal bottom surface 106 connecting the lower ends of the side surfaces 104 and 105.  The battery 40! is adapted to be vertically mounted into the mounting groove 107.  The dimensions of the bottom surface 106 are set so that when the battery 40i is mounted into the mounting groove 107, the push button 68 of the battery meter 67 located on the upper surface of the battery 40i is positioned over the bottom surface 106. [0056]<br>
The side surfaces 104 and 105 are tapered in such a manner as to be diverged toward the upper side for the purpose of ease of mounting of the battery 40! into the mounting groove 107.  A pair of vertically elongated ribs 108 project from the side surface 104 at its lower portion. The side surface 104 is opposed to the rear surface of the battery 40i mounted in the mounting groove 107, and the ribs 108 come into contact with the rear surface of the battery 40i on the right and left sides of the guide 62b formed on the rear surface of the battery 40i.  Further, a<br>
plurality of (e.g., three) vertically elongated ribs 109 project from the side surface 105 over the height of the side surface 105.  The side surface 105 is opposed to the front surface of the battery 40a mounted in the mounting groove 107, and the ribs 109 come into contact with the front surface of the battery 40!. These ribs 108 and 109 are also tapered in such a manner as to be diverged toward the upper side like the side surfaces 104 and 105 mentioned above. However, an angle of inclination of the ribs 108 and 109 is set smaller than that of the side surfaces 104 and 105.  Accordingly, the battery 401 can be easily mounted into and demounted from the mounting groove 107 owing to the inclination of the side surfaces 104 and 105 and the ribs 108 and 109, and the front and rear surfaces of the battery 40! can be effectively supported by the ribs 109 and 108, respectively, which are less inclined than the side surfaces 104 and 105, thereby preventing frontward and rearward play of the battery 40x within the mounting groove 107. [0057]<br>
The side surface 104 is further formed with a guide recess 110 open on the upper side. The guide recess 110 is adapted to vertically receive the guide 62b projecting from the rear surface of the battery case 62 of the battery 40i.<br>
The guide recess 110 has opposite side surfaces llOa at its upper portion, which are tapered in such a manner as to be diverged toward the upper side for the purpose of ease of<br>
insertion of the guide 62b into the guide recess 110.<br>
[0057]The guide recess 110 is further provided with two projections 111 adapted to engage the two guide grooves 85 formed on the rear surface of the battery 40^  By the engagement of the projections 111 with the guide grooves 85, lateral play of the battery 40i within the mounting groove 107 can be prevented. [0058]<br>
Referring to FIG. 17, the charger 100 includes a power circuit 115 adapted to be connected through a connector 114 to an AC power source, a control circuit 116 constructed of a microcomputer, a drive circuit 117, a MOS-FET 118, a transistor 119, and a diode 120. [0059]<br>
A first charge terminal 121 is connected to one end of the power circuit 115, and a second charge terminal 122 is connected through the MOS-FET 118, the transistor 119, and the diode 120 to the other end of the power circuit 115.  The control circuit 116 has a transistor 125 connected to the gate of the MOS-FET 118.  The base of the<br>
transistor 125 is connected to a thermistor terminal 123. A control signal for current switching is input from the control circuit 116 to the power circuit 115, and a voltage signal at the second charge terminal 122 is input to the control circuit 116.  Further, an output end of the drive circuit 117 is connected to the base of the transistor 119, so as to control switching on and off of the transistor 119.  A battery detection terminal 124 is connected to an input end of the drive circuit 117.<br>
[0060]<br>
A substrate 113 is disposed in the low-level portion 102 and a part of the high-level portion 103 on the low-level portion 102 side with respect to the mounting groove 107 in such a manner as to be located aside a lower portion of the battery 40i mounted in the mounting groove 107.  The electric components shown in FIG. 17 are mounted on the substrate 113.  Thus, the substrate 113 is provided inside the housing 101 in such a manner as to be located aside the lower portion of the battery 40i mounted in the mounting groove 107, so that the mounting position of the battery 40i into the charger 100 can be set as low as possible, thereby stabilizing the mounted condition of the battery 40i in the charger 100. [0061]<br><br>
The lower portion of the guide recess 110 formed on the side surface 104 of the mounting groove 107 is formed with projections 126, 127, and 128 adapted to respectively engage the slits 82, 83, and 84 formed on the rear surface of the battery 40^  The first charge terminal 121 and the battery detection terminal 124 are formed from a wire, and bent portions of the terminals 121 and 124 project from an opening 129 formed through the projection 126 so as to come into resilient sliding contact with the charge terminal 75b of the first connection terminal 75 when the battery 40! is mounted into the mounting groove 107.  Similarly, the second charge terminal 122 formed from a wire projects from an opening (not shown) of the projection 127 so as to come into resilient sliding contact with the charge terminal 76b of the second connection terminal 76 when the battery 40i is mounted into the mounting groove 107.  Similarly, the thermistor terminal 123 formed from a wire projects from an opening (not shown) of the projection 128 so as to come into resilient sliding contact with the third connection terminal 77 when the battery 40i is mounted into the mounting groove 107.<br>
[0062]<br>
The operation of the first preferred embodiment will now be described.  The battery mounting portion 39i is<br><br>
provided at the rear portion of the front basket 38l to allow mounting and demounting of the battery ^Ol from the mount opening 48 exposed into the front basket 38x and also allow the battery 40! to be fixedly mounted.  Accordingly, the need for any extra operation such as rotation of the seat post 28 can be eliminated, and the battery 40i can be easily mounted into and demounted from the battery mounting portion 39X by a very simple operation similar to a loading/unloading operation for a baggage into/from the front basket 38i irrespective of the position of the bar handle 24.  Further, even if the battery 40j is inadvertently dropped in the mounting or demounting operation into or from the battery mounting portion 39!, the battery 40i can be received by the front basket 38i, thereby preventing damage to the battery 40j.  Further, since the battery mounting portion 39x is not present inside the front basket 38!, a baggage storage space of the front basket 38i is not sacrificed by the battery mounting portion 39i. [0063]<br><br>
Further, the battery mounting portion 39i is provided with the discharge terminals 89 and 90 adapted to be electrically connected to the contacts 75a and 76a of the battery 40i, respectively, in response to mounting of<br>
the battery 40i into the battery mounting portion 39^ Accordingly, electrical connection between the battery 40a and the battery mounting portion 39j can be easily made in response to mounting of the battery 40: into the battery mounting portion 39x. [0065]<br><br>
The lock mechanism 155} is provided between the battery 40j and the battery mounting portion 39j, and the operating portion 156 for performing locking and unlocking operations of the lock mechanism 155} is provided on one of the right and left sides of the battery mounting portion 39lf e.g., on the right side of the battery mounting portion 39i.  Accordingly, the locking and unlocking operations of the lock mechanism I55i can be easily performed without hindrance by the brake cables 44L and 44R extending behind the front basket 38 x.  Furthermore, the lock mechanism [0066]<br>
 includes the first engaging member 157 adapted to disengageably engage one of the right and left side portions of the battery 40i, e.g., the right side portion of the battery 40l according to the locking operation of the operating portion 156, and the second<br>
*<br>
engaging member 158 adapted to disengageably engage the other of the right and left side portions of the battery mounting portion 39i, e.g., the left side portion of the<br>
battery mounting portion 39X in response to the movement of the first engaging member 157.  With this arrangement, the right and left side portions of the battery 40x are engaged with the right and left side portions of the battery mounting portion 39l7 respectively, thus reliably mounting the battery 40i in the battery mounting portion 39:. Furthermore, the second engaging member 158 is a rodlike member extending over the substantially entire length between the right and left side portions of the battery 40i and axially movably supported to the battery 40i. Accordingly, the configuration of the lock mechanism 155} can be simplified. [0067]<br><br>
The battery meter 67 is provided on the upper surface of the battery case 62 of the battery 40!, so that the battery meter 67 is visible from the upper side. Accordingly, a rider on the bicycle can easily visibly check the battery meter 67 even in the condition that the rider is sitting on the seat 27, thus allowing easy check of the remaining capacity of the battery 40l.  Further, only when the push button 68 is depressed, the battery meter 67 is turned on to indicate the remaining capacity of the battery 40}.  Accordingly, undue power consumption by the battery meter 67 can be prevented, and the rider's view<br><br>
is not spoiled by the indication of the battery meter 67<br>
during running.<br>
[0067]<br>
The first and second connection terminals 75 and 76 of the battery 40: are used both in discharging and in charging.  Therefore, as compared with a battery having connection terminals dedicated for discharging and connection terminals dedicated for charging, the number of parts can be reduced and the wiring structure in the battery case 62 can be simplified. [0068]<br><br>
A current flowing in discharging from the battery 40i, i.e., in feeding to the electric motor 30 is relatively large, while a current flowing in charging to the battery 40]. is relatively small.  Therefore, in the case that electrical connection is made at the same position on the first and second connection terminals 75 and 76 both in discharging and in charging, the electrical capacity of both the connection terminals 75 and 76 must be set large, and the electrical capacity of both the charge terminals 121 and 122 of the charger 100 must also be set large. However, according to this preferred embodiment, the discharge contacts 75a and 76a to be connected to the first and second discharge terminals 89 and 90 and the<br>
charge contacts 75b and 76b to be connected to the first and second charge terminals 121 and 122 are provided at different positions on the first and second connection terminals 75 and 76.  Accordingly, although the first and second connection terminals 75 and 76 are used commonly in discharging and in charging, electrical characteristics required in discharging and in charging can be satisfied. That is, in discharging where a large current flows, the discharge contacts 75a and 76b formed as silver contacts are in resilient point contact with the front and second discharge terminals 89 and 90, respectively, in coaxial relationship, thereby reducing wear in the contact condition to cope with the flow of such a large current in discharging.  On the other hand, in charging where a small current flows, the first and second charge terminals 121 and 122 formed from a wire wipe the charge contacts 75b and 76b in inserting the battery 40i into the mounting groove 107 of the charger 100, and thereby clean off dust or the like on the surfaces of the charge contacts 75b and 76b, thus providing a connection structure with no faulty contact to cope with the flow of such a small current in charging. [0069]<br><br>
Further, the discharge contacts 75a and 76a of the<br>
first and second connection terminals 75 and 76 are exposed to the bottom surface of the battery case 62 of the battery 40!, while the charge contacts 75b and 76b of the first and second connection terminals 75 and 76 are exposed to the rear surface of the battery case 62 perpendicular to the bottom surface.  Accordingly, possible misconnection in discharging and in charging can be prevented. [0070]<br><br>
The battery 40j is adapted to be vertically mounted into the charger 100, and charging of the battery 40X can be effected by such vertical mounting into the charger 100. Accordingly, the need for connection work in charging can be eliminated to thereby make charging work easy. [0071]The terminals 121 to 124 are provided on the side surface 104 different from the bottom surface 106 of the mounting groove 107, which bottom surface 106 is a wall surface on which the self-weight of the battery 40x acts in mounting the battery 40i into the charger 100, and the terminals 121 to 124 are connected to the charge contacts 75b and 76b and the third connection terminal 77 each exposed to the rear surface of the battery 40!. Accordingly, the self-weight of the battery 40i which is relatively heavy is prevented from acting on the terminals<br>
121 to 124 of the charger 100, and the terminals 121 to 124 can be made light and compact.<br>
Further, the battery meter 67 provided on the upper surface of the battery 40X can be visibly checked from the upper side in mounting the battery 40j in the charger 100. In addition, since the push button 68 for operating the battery meter 67 is adapted to be vertically pushed in the charger 100, there is no possibility that the connection of the terminals of the battery 40j with the terminals 121 to 124 may be canceled by a depression force applied to the push button 68. [0072]<br>
FIGS. 18 and 19 show a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, FIG, 18 is a vertical sectional view of an essential part of the second preferred embodiment, which is a cross section taken along the line 18-18 in FIG. 19, and FIG. 19 is a cross section taken along the line 19-19 in FIG. 18.<br>
A front basket 382 is fixedly supported through a support member 181 to the head pipe 22, and a battery mounting portion 392 is fixedly provided at a rear portion of the front basket 382.  A battery 402 can be fixedly<br>

The battery mounting portion 392 is formed from a metal plate and has a substantially L-shaped configuration as viewed in vertical section.  That is, the battery mounting portion 392 has a portion adapted to face a rear portion of the battery 402 which rear portion is formed with a guide 62b' and a portion adapted to face a bottom portion of the battery 402 which bottom portion is formed with a recess 62a'.  The battery mounting portion 392 is secured together with the rear portion of the front basket 382 to the support member 181 by means of a plurality of (e.g., four) bolts 183 and nuts 184. [0074]<br>
A terminal box 88 is mounted on a lower portion of the battery mounting portion 392 so as to be engaged with the recess 62a' formed on the bottom portion of the battery 402.  The lower portion of the battery mounting portion 392 is formed at its front end with a pair of right and left<br>
*<br>
connecting portions 185 extending downward.  Each connecting portion 185 is formed with a rectangular connection hole 186.  Further, the lower portion of the<br>
battery mounting portion 392 is formed at its front end with a supporting portion 187 extending obliquely upward between the right and left connecting portions 185.  The supporting portion 187 serves to support the front lower end of the battery 402.<br>
[0077]The lid 132 is formed of a synthetic resin and has a boxlike, substantially L-shaped configuration as viewed in vertical section.  That is, the lid 132 has a portion adapted to face the front surface of the battery 402 and a portion adapted to face the upper surface of the battery 402-  The lid 132 further has opposed side portions adapted to face the opposite side surfaces of the battery 402.  The lid 132 is formed at its lower end with a pair of right and left connecting portions 188 respectively inserted through and engaged with the connection holes 186 of the right and left connecting portions 185 of the battery mounting portion 392.  That is, the lid 132 is pivotable frontward and rearward in the front basket 382 about engaging portions between the connecting portions 185 and the connecting portions 188. [ 0078 ]~<br>
As similar to the battery 40i of the first preferred embodiment, the bottom portion of the battery 402<br>
is provided with discharge contacts 75a and 76a adapted to be connected to discharge terminals 89 and 90 provided in the terminal box 88.  When the battery 402 is mounted onto the battery mounting portion 392,the discharge contacts 75a and 76a come to electrical connection with the discharge terminals 89 and 90[0079]<br>
Attached to the inner surface of the lid 182 are an elastic member 189 adapted to come into elastic contact with the front surface of the battery 402, thereby pressing the guide 62b' of the rear surface of the battery 402 against the battery mounting portion 392 and an elastic member 190 adapted to come into elastic contact with the upper surface of the battery 402, thereby pressing the bottom portion of the battery 402 against the battery mounting portion 392.  Further, the front surface of the battery 402 is formed with an engagement recess 191, and the inner surface of the lid 182 is integrally formed with an engagement projection 192 adapted to engage the engagement recess 191.  Accordingly, when the lid 182 is closed, play of the battery 402 between the lid 182 and the battery mounting portion 392 can be prevented, and stable connection of the battery 402 and the discharge terminals 89 and 90 can be maintained.<br>
The upper end of the battery mounting portion 392 is formed with a tongue portion 193 extending obliquely rearward, and the upper end of the lid 182 is formed with a tongue portion 194 adapted to face the tongue portion 193 from the upper side. A lock mechanism 1552 for fixedly maintaining a closed condition of the lid 182 is provided between the two tongue portions 193 and 194 on a longitudinal center line of the body frame 21 (see FIG. 1).<br>
The lock mechanism 1552 includes an operating portion 196 fixed to the tongue portion 194 of the lid 182 and having a key hole 195 exposed to the upper surface, an engagement hole 197 formed through the tongue portion 193 of the battery mounting portion 392 for disengageably engage the operating portion 196, and a pawl 198 operatively provided in the engaging portion 196 and adapted to engage the lower surface of the tongue portion 193 at the periphery of the engagement hole 197. Accordingly, when a key (not shown) inserted into the key hole 195 is operated in the closed condition of the lid 182, the pawl 198 comes into engagement with the tongue portion 193, thereby fixedly maintaining the closed condition of the lid 182.<br>
According to the second preferred embodiment, the battery mounting portion 392 adapted to detachably support the battery 402 is fixedly provided in the rear portion of the front basket 392, and the lid 182 adapted to cover the battery 402 supported on the battery mounting portion 392 from the front side is connected to the lower portion of the battery mounting portion 392 so as to be pivotable frontward and rearward in the front basket 382.  With this arrangement, like the first preferred embodiment, the battery 402 can be easily mounted to and demounted from the battery mounting portion 392 by such a very simple operation as to only swing the lid 182 frontward and rearward as similar to a loading/unloading operation for a baggage into/from the front basket 382.  Further, even if the battery 402 is inadvertently dropped in the mounting or demounting operation onto or from the battery mounting portion 392/ the battery 402 can be received by the front basket 382, thereby preventing damage to the battery 402. Further, electrical connection between the battery 402 and the discharge terminals 89 and 90 can be easily made in response to supporting of the battery 402 onto the battery mounting portion 392[0083]Further, the lock mechanism 1552 for fixedly maintaining the closed condition of the lid 182 is located on the longitudinal center line of the body frame 21. Accordingly, the locking and unlocking operations of the lock mechanism 1552 can be easily performed without hindrance by the brake cables 44L and 44R extending behind the front basket 382.<br>
