				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved mild steel handloom for weaving of coir, jute and sisal mattings.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Conventional handlooms for weaving of coir mattings are made of wood and are quite heavy, having a weight of more than 500 kgs. The operation of such handlooms requires exertion of a large force and therefore can be operated only by persons having sound physique. It is because of this reason that whereas large number of women are employed in spinning industry, there are practically no women workers engaged on handlooms for the weaving of coir as it involves a lot of efforts and drudgery in its operation.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above mentioned conventional wooden handlooms is that these being heavy weight, are difficult to shift from one place to another and remain in the same location for decades together.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above mentioned handlooms is that due to their huge structure, they occupy large space which may be one room in rural areas. Even if a handloom is not in use due to no member in a family being in a position to operate or due<br><br>
to handloom being in inoperational condition, one room remams occupiea by the handloom without any economic pay off resulting therefrom.<br>
Further disadvantages of the above mentioned handloom is that the repair cost is high, which is generally beyond affordability in rural areas.<br>
Still further disadvantage of the above mentioned handloom is that due to scarcity of wood, the looms are becoming difficult to maintain.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of the above mentioned handloom is that in places like the places in Kerala state in India where rainy season lasts for more than 6 months, the wood gets easily attacked by moths, mildews and moulds thereby increasing the maintenance cost.<br>
Even further drawback of the above mentioned handloom is that this handloom requires minimum of two persons for its operation. The earnings from the loom therefore get divided into two persons and therefore operating the loom becomes uneconomical.<br>
Still further drawback of the above handloom is that in these looms, the movement of sley is regulated by hand which gives irregular number of wefts per unit length.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom of mild steel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a handloom which enables the automatic formation of the weft at uniform distance and auto winding of the woven product.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which is light in weight with weight around 100 kg as compared to over 500 kg, of the conventional wooden handloom.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which is smaller in structure, occupying relatively much smaller space as compared to known wooden handlooms.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which can be easily shifted from one location to another location.<br>
Still further objects of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which is longer lasting requiring minimum maintenance cost.<br><br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom that does not involve drudgery and can be conveniently operated even by women.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which can be operated by one person as compared to two persons required for operating wooden handloom.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an improved handloom which is more productive.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved mild steel handloom mounted on mild steel frame and comprising chain beam consisting of GI pipe provided with two flanges, one at each end, brake mechanism having a brake shoe fitted over the GI pipe and brake liner provided over the brake shoe and a lever having weight at its one end; a chain rest provided breadth wise at one end of the frame and supported by two brackets one at each end which are bolted to the frame; a heddle frame assembly comprising a pair of rectangular heddle frames hanged at one end a pair, by cycle chains and sprockets from frames and connected at other end to pedals through pair of cables; sley with take-<br><br>
up mechanism consisting of ratchet wheel mounted axially over the emery roller, a pawl mechanism connected to the said sley by connecting lever, the upper part of said sley holding reed, pawl mechanism comprising of a tube containing pawl axially disposed therein and having tapered tip at its lower most end, a spring, the movement of pawl being guided through a slot and the tube having lift head at its upper end; cloth beam of mild steel consisting of ratchet wheel mounted over pipe, a lever with catch pivoted over the ratchet wheel.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION w.r.t, DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to fig. 1, improved handloom of the present invention, is mounted on mild steel frame (2) and comprises chain rest (1) to hold the warp firmly at a particular tension. Two headle frames (10,11) hanged from two mild steel frames (13,14) by two cycle chains and sprockets (8,12) which divide the warp threads to make 'shed'. A sley (4) with lower end hinged to the bottom portion of the said mild steel frame (2) and having the upper end free which can be manually moved to and fro. The sley (4) straightens the weft and keeps uniform distance, maintaining the uniformity of the mesh through the emery roller (6). A press roller (7) made of mild steel is mounted on two brackets (not shoAvn in fig) under the said emery roller (6). The said press roller (7) stretches the cloth before winding over the cloth beam (5). The cloth beam (5) is cylindrical in shape and is mounted on two supports like (15) and rotates around a Galvanised Iron (GI) pipe. A<br><br>
chain beam (3) comprising of GI pipe is provided with two flanges (16,17) with one flange mounted on each end of the GI pipe. A brake system comprismg of at least one brake shoe (27) (fig.2) is mounted on the one end of GI pipe to maintain the uniform tension. A brake liner (18) is fitted over the said brake shoe. A cable system comprising a pair of cables (9,21) is connected at one end to a pair of pedals (19,20) and is connected at the other end to the pair of heddle (10,11), When the pedals are pressed by the operator, the corresponding heddle frame will come down and the other heddle frame will automatically come up to make a 'shed'. A handle lever with catch (22) is fitted over cloth beam (5) to give uniform tension over the woven product. A MS cover (23) is provided over the said emery roller to protect the operator from any injury or from damaging his clothes. A brake load lever (24) with weight (25) is provided on the frame (2).<br>
Referring to fig (2) which shows the construction of chain beam (3), the said chain beam comprises a pipe (26) having flanges (16,17) at its ends. A brake shoe (27) is mounted axially on the pipe (26) to suit with the brake liner (18) which is connected with the brake load lever (24) to facilitate suitable fiiction to maintain tension for weaving. The brake load lever (24) is hinged to the frame (2) at one end and has weight (25) at the other end.<br>
Referring to Fig.3, the cloth beam (5) comprises ratchet wheel (29)_mounted over the pipe (30). A lever (22) with catch (28) is pivoted over the said ratchet wheel (29).<br><br>
Referring to fig.4, heddle unit comprises of a pair of two MS heddle frames (10,11) hanging with the help of pair of cycle chain and sprockets (8,12) from hanging frames (13,14) by nut &amp; boh means. The hanging frames (13,14) are welded over the upper part of MS frame (2). The one end of the cycle chains is connected to the upper end of the heddle frames (10,11). The lower end of each of the heddle frame is connected to the cables (9,15) which are connected to the corresponding pedals (19,20),<br>
Referring to fig. (5), an emery roller (6) of mild steel pipe, covered with emery fillet made of high carbon steel, is mounted on brackets at both ends of breadth side of the frame (2). The emery roller (6) is provided with ratchet (32) and pawl (33) mechanism at its one end, for take-up motions which is connected to sley (4) by connecting rod (34). The sley (4) has rectangular shape with bottom side open. The upper part of sley holds the reeds (35) to maintain dent (i.e. gap between the two warp yams). The bottom portion of sley is connected to the connecting rod (34) attached to ratchet wheel to help take-up motion. The two bottom ends of sley are pivoted to the frame (2) The construction of pawl mechanism is shown in detail in fig.5(d). The pawl mechanism comprises of a tube (36) containing axially a pawl disposed therein and having spring (38). The pawl has a shape of roller with tapered end at its lower most end. The tube (36) is provided with a lifl;er head (39) at its upper end, which is guided through a slot (40), When the ratchet wheel (32) rotates anti-clockwise, the lower most tip of pawl catches the ratchet wheel and<br>
rotates the emery roller. When the ratchet wheel (32) is rotated clockwise, the lower most tip of pawl (37) will slip over the teeth of the ratchet wheel and there will be no motion in the emery roller.<br>
METHOD OF WORKING<br>
The chain beam (3) is fixed by the operator and all the warp threads are placed over the chain rest beam (1) and each and every end of the warp is passed through the heddle eyes of the heddle frame and through reeds of sley and connected over the take-up mechanism and connected over the cloth beam. The weight (25) is loaded over the lever (24) and the lever (22) and catch (28) are adjusted accordingly. The operator then presses down one of the pedals to make a shed. The operator passes one weft through the shed thus formed. Pressure is then applied to pull and back the sley (4). The operator then presses another pedal for making the next shed for inserting another weft and repeat the same operation for weaving. With the help of take-up mechanism and connecting rod etc, the woven product, according to desired specifications, is automatically wound over the cloth beam. The weaving capacity of the handloom is 85 metres as compared to traditional handloom which have the capacity of 50-60 metres.<br>
It is to be noted that present invention is susceptible to modifications changes and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such, variant embodiments incorporating the concepts and features of the present invention, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is fiirther set forth under the following claims:<br><br>
