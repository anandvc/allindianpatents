State of the Art<br>
[0005] VLA-4 (also referred to as α4β1 intcgrin and CD49d/CD29), first identified by<br>
Hcmlcr and Takada,1 is a member of the β1 intcgrin family of cell surface receptors, each<br>
of which comprises two subunits, an a chain and a β chain. VLA-4 contains an aA chain<br><br>
and a β1 chain. There arc at least nine pi integrities, all sharing the same β1 chain and each<br>
having a distinct a chain. These nine receptors all bind a different complement of the<br>
various cell matrix molecules, such as fibroncctin, laminin, and collagen. VLA-4, for<br>
example, binds to fibroncctin. VLA-4 also binds non-matrix molecules that arc expressed<br>
by cndothclial and other cells. These non-matrix molecules include VCAM-1. which is<br>
expressed on cytokine-activated human umbilical vein cndothclial cells in culture.<br>
Distinct epitopes of VLA-4 arc responsible for the fibroncctin and VCAM-1 binding<br>
activities and each activity has been shown to be inhibited independently.2<br>
[0006] Intercellular adhesion mediated by VLA-4 and other cell surface receptors is<br>
associated with a number of inflammatory responses. At the site of an injury or other<br>
inflammatory stimulus, activated vascular endothelial cells express molecules that are<br>
adhesive for leukocytes. The mechanics of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells<br>
involves, in part, the recognition and binding of cell surface receptors on leukocytes to the<br>
corresponding cell surface molecules on endothclial cells. Once bound, the leukocytes<br>
migrate across the blood vessel wall to enter the injured site and release chemical<br>
mediators to combat infection. For reviews of adhesion receptors of the immune system,<br>
sec, for example, Springer' and Osborn.4<br>
[0007] Inflammatory brain disorders, such as experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyeitis tEAE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and meningitis, arc examples of central<br>
nervous system disorders in which the endothelium leukocyte adhesion mecanism results<br>
in destruction to otherwise healthy brain tissue. Large numbers of leukocytes migrate<br>
across the blood brain barrier (BBB) in subjects with these inflammatory diseases. The<br>
leukocytes release toxic mediators that cause extensive tissue damage resulting in<br>
impaired nerve conduction and paralysis.<br>
[0008] In other organ systems, tissue damage also occurs via an adhesion mechanism<br>
resulting in migration or activation of leukocytes. For example, it has been shown that the<br>
initial insult following myocardial ischemia to heart tissue can be further complicated by<br>
leukocyte entry to the injured tissue causing still further insult (Vedder. et al.).5 Other<br>
inflammatory or medical conditions mediated by an adhesion mechanism include, by way<br>
of example, asthma.68 Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis,9,10AIDS dementia,"<br>
diabetes12 11 (including acute juvenile onset diabetes), inflammatory bowel disease15<br><br>
(including ulccrativc colitis and Crohn's: disease), multiple sclerosis,16-17 rheumatoid<br>
arthritis,18-21 tissue transplantation,22 tumor metastasis,23-28 meningitis, encephalitis, stroke,<br>
and other cerebral traumas, nephritis, rclinitis. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial<br>
ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury such as that which occurs in adult<br>
respiratory distress syndrome.<br>
[0009] Substituted aminopyrimidines, as a class, have been disclosed as inhibiting<br>
binding of VLA-4 to VCAM-1 and, accordingly, exhibit anti-infiammatory properties.29<br>
While these compounds possess antagonist properties to such binding, enhanced<br>
bioavailability of these compounds would augment their efficacy.<br>

It should also be understood that other carboxylic acid derivatives would be useful in the<br>
practice of this invention, for example, carboxylic acid amides, including carboxamides,<br>

[0048] The term "pharmaceutically-acccptable cation" refers to the cation of a<br>
pharmaccutically-acccptablc salt.<br>
[0049] It is understood that in all substitulec' groups defined herein, polymers arrived at<br>
by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl<br>
having a substituted aryl group as a substitucnt which is itself substituted with a<br>
substituted aryl group, etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein, fn such cases, the<br><br>
maximum number of such substituents is three. That is to say that each of the above<br>
definitions is constrained by a limitation that, for example, substituted aryl groups are<br>
limited to -substituted ary!-(substituted aryl ^(substituted aryl).<br>
[0050] "Treating"1 or '-treatment" of a disease includes:<br>
(1)	preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to<br>
develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but docs not<br>
yet experience or display symptoms of the disease,<br>
(2)	inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease<br>
or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
(3)	relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical<br>
symptoms.<br>
[0051] A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that,<br>
when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such<br>
treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on<br>
the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be<br>
treated.<br>
[0052] Intcgrins arc a large family of homologous transmembranc linker proteins that<br>
are the principal receptors on animal cells for binding most extracellular matrix proteins,<br>
such as collayen. fibronectin. and laminin. the integrins are heterodimers comprised of an<br>
a chain and a β chain. To date, twenty different integrin heterodimers, made from 9<br>
different a subunits and 14 different β subunits, have been identified. The term " 4<br>
intcgrins"' refers to the class of heterodimcr, enzyme-linked cell-surface receptors that<br>
contain the a 4 subunit paired with any of the β subunits. VLA-4 is an example of an a 4<br>
integrin, and is a heterodimcr of the  4 and β1 subunits, and is also referred to as  4 β1<br>
integrin.<br>
Compound Preparation<br>
[0053] The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting<br>
materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that<br>
where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e.. reaction temperatures, times, mole<br>
ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) arc given, other process conditions can also be<br><br>
used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular<br>
reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art<br>
by routine optimization procedures.<br>
[0054] Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional<br>
protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing<br>
undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as<br>
suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well<br>
known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups arc described in T. W. Greene<br>
and G. VI. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New<br>
York, 1991, and references cited therein.<br>
[0055] Furthermore, the compounds of this invention will typically contain one or more<br>
chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as<br>
pure stercoisomcrs, i.e., as individual cnan:iomers or diastcreomers, or as stercoisomer-<br>
enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the<br>
scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched<br>
mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or<br>
stercosclective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such<br>
compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral<br>
resolving agents arid the like.<br>
[0056] Most compounds of this invention were named using C'hemDraw \. !0.(),<br>
(available from Cambridgesoft at 100 Cambridge Park Drive, Cambridge, VIA 02140).<br>
[0057] In one embodiment, the compounds of this invention can be prepared as<br>
described below in Scheme 1 where for illustrative purposes only, R1 is methyl and R2 is<br>
isopropyl.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
where Pg is a carboxyl protecting group such as benzyl, /-butyl, and the like.<br>
[0058] Scheme 1 is particularly useful in the preparation of compounds where R2 is alkyl<br>
or cycloalkyl.<br>
[0059] In Scheme 1. the starting 5-aminopyrimidine intermediates, compound 1.1, are<br>
described in detail in US Patent No. US 7,026,328 Bl and, lor the sake of illustration only,<br>
arc shown in this scheme as 4-substitutcd phcnylalanine derivatives. It is understood, of<br>
course, that 2- and 3-substituted phcnylalanine derivatives would follow a similar reaction<br>
pathway.<br>
[0060] Specifically, in Scheme 1, 5-amino-2-diethylamino-4-substituted pyrimidine,<br>
compound 1.1 (prepared from by corresponding 5-nitro-pyrimidinc by reduction with 5%<br>
Pd/C or 5% PtO? by weight) is reacted under convcntioanl reductive animation conditions<br>
with a slight excess of a C1-C4 aldehyde or ketone which is Scheme 1 is illustrated by<br>
acetone. In Scheme I, the 5-amino group of compound 1.1 forms an intermediate imine<br>
(not shown) which is in situ reduced to the corresponding aminc, compound 1.2, by<br>
conventional reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydrido, sodium borohydride,<br>
hydrogen over a suitable catalyst such as PtO2, and the like. The reaction i.s conducted in a<br><br>
suitable inert diluent such as tetrahydrof jran, mcthylcnc chloride, and the like. The<br>
reaction is maintained at from about 0cC to about 30°C until the reaction is substantially<br>
complete which typically occurs within a bout 0.5 to 16 hours. Upon completion of the<br>
reaction, the compound 1.2 is recovered by conventional methods including neutralization,<br>
evaporation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like or,<br>
alternatively, is employed in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0061] Conversion of the amine group in compound 1.2 to the corresponding<br>
alkylsulfonylamido group, compound 1.3, proceeds via conventional methods. Tor<br>
example, in one method, compound 1.2 is contacted with a slight excess of an<br>
alkaneMilfonyl halide, such as methancsulfonyl chloride, in the presence of a suitable base<br>
such as triethylaminc, diisopropylcthylam.ne and the like in order to scavenge the acid<br>
generated. The reaction is preferably conducted in a suitable inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxanc, chloroform and the like. The reaction is preferably conducted at<br>
from about -5o to -30oC and is continued until the reaction is substantially complete which<br>
typically occurs in 0.5 to 16 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 1.3 can<br>
be recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the<br>
next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0062] Alkvlsulfonyl halidcs are either krown compounds or compounds that can be<br>
prepared by con\enton svnthctie procedures. Such compounds are typically prepared<br>
from the corresponding sulfonic acid, i.e., from the compounds of the formula R1-SO4H<br>
where R1 is as defined above, using phosphorus trichloride and phosphorus pcntachloridc.<br>
The reaction is generally conducted by contacting the sulfonic acid with about 2 to 5 molar<br>
equivalents of phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus pcntachloridc, either neat or in an<br>
inert solvent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature in the range of 0°C to about 80°C<br>
for about 1 to about 48 hours to afford the sulfonyl chloride. Alternatively, the sulfonyl<br>
chloride can be prepared from the corresponding thiol compound, i.e., from compounds of<br>
the formula R1-SH where R1 is as defined above, by treating the thiol with chlorine (Cl2)<br>
and water under conventional reaction conditions.<br>
[0063] Examples of sulfonyl chlorides for use in this invention include, but are not<br>
limited to. methanesulfonyl chloride, ethanesalfonyl chloride, 2-propanesulfonyl chloride.<br><br>
l-butancsu!fonyl chloride, trifluoromcthanc.su!fonyl chloride, 2,2,2-trifluoroethancsulfonyl<br>
chloride, and the like.<br>
[0064] The carboxyl protecting group of compound 1.3 is then removed by conventional<br>
conditions to provide for compound 1.4. a compound of Formula 1. In one embodiment, a<br>
t-butyl protecting group can be removed by contact with formic acid. In another<br>
embodiment, a benzyl protecting group can be removed by contact with hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a palladium/carbon catalyst typically in a protic solvent such as methanol<br>
under elevated hydrogen pressures. Upor completion of the reaction, compound 1.4 can<br>
be recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like.<br>
[0065] In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention can be prepared as<br>
described below in Scheme 2:<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
where R1 and R" is as defined herein; Pg is a carboxyl protecting group and X is halo.<br>
[0066] In Scheme 2, the starting 5-amhopyrimidine intermediates, compound 1.1, are<br>
described in detail in US Patent No. US 7,026,328 Bl and, for the sake of illustration only,<br>
are shown in this scheme as 4-substitutcd phenylalaninc derivatives. It is understood, of<br>
course, that 2- and 3-substituted phenylalaninc derivatives would follow a similar reaction<br>
pathway.<br>
[0067] Specifically, in Scheme 2, 5-amino-2-diethylamino-4-substituted pyrirnidine,<br>
compound 1.1 (prepared from by corresponding 5-nitro-pyrimidine by reduction with 5%<br>
Pd/C or 5% PtO2 by weight) is reacted with a slight excess of an R1-sulfonyl halidc. such<br>
as methancsulfonyl chloride, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine and the like in order to scavenge the acid generated. The reaction<br>
is preferably conducted in a suitable inert solvent such as tctrahydrofuran, dioxane,<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform and the like. The reaction is preferably conducted at from<br>
about -5° to 30°C and is continued until the reaction is substantially complete which<br>
typically occurs in 0.5 to 16 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 1.5 can<br>
be recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the<br>
next step without purification and or isolation.<br>
[0068] Selective removal of a single R SO:- group from compound 1.5 proceeds under<br>
conventional conditions. For example, reaction of compound 1.5 with base in a protic<br>
solvent such as methanol, cthanol, or water, optionally in (he presence of THF and the<br>
like, e.g. a 1:1 mixture of mcthanol/tetrahydrofuran or 1:1 mixture of water<br>
tetrahydrofuran provides for compound 1.6. The reaction mixture comprises an excess of<br>
a suitable base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and the like and the<br>
reaction is preferably maintained at elevated temperatures such 20° to 60°C. The reaction<br>
is continued until substantially complete which typically occurs in 24-144 hours. Upon<br>
completion of the reaction, compound 1.6 can be recovered by conventional methods<br>
including neutralization, evaporation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration,<br>
and the like or, alternatively, is employed in ihc next step without purification and/or<br>
isolation.<br><br>
[0069] Reaction of compound 1.6 with an excess of an alkyl halide, a dialkyl sulfate, an<br>
alkenyl halide, an alkynyl halide, or a cycloalkyl halide (i.e.. X-R2 - the "halide<br>
compound") proceeds under conventional conditions to provide for compound 1.7. The<br>
reaction is typically conducted by contacting compound 1.6 with from about 1.1 to 20<br>
equivalent so of the halide compound in an inert diluent such as acetone, chloroform,<br>
methylenc chloride and the like in ihc presence of a base such as potassium carbonate,<br>
tricthylaminc and the like to scavenge the acid generated during reaction. The reaction is<br>
preferably conducted at from about 20" to 60°C and is continued until the reaction is<br>
substantially complete which typically occurs in 0.1 to 16 hours. Upon completion of the<br>
reaction, compound 1.6 can be recovered by conventional methods including<br>
neutralization, evaporation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography. filtration, and the<br>
like or, alternatively, is employed in the next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0070] The carboxyl protecting group of compound 1.7 is then removed by conventional<br>
conditions to provide for compound 1.8, a compound of Formula 1. In one embodiment, a<br>
t-butyl protecting group can be removed by contact with formic acid. In another<br>
embodiment, a benzyl protecting group can be removed by contact with hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a palladium/carbon catalyst typically in a protic solvent such as methanol<br>
under elevated hydrogen pressures. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 1.8 can<br>
be recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography. nitration, and the like.<br>
[0071] In still another embodiment, the compounds of this invention can be prepared as<br>
described below in Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
whore R1 is as defined above, Pg is a carboxy! protecting group such as benzyl. t-butyl,<br>
and the like and R2 is an alkyl. alkenyl, alkynyl, or phenvlalkylonc group ha\ing a CH2<br>
moiety attached to the iodo group.<br>
[0072] In Scheme 1. the starting 5-aminopyrimidinc intermediates, compound I.I, are<br>
described in detail in US Patent No 7,026,328 Bl and, for the sake of illustration only, are<br>
shown in this .scheme as 4-substitutcd phcnylalanine derivatives. It is understood, of<br>
course, that 2- and 3-substitutcd phcnylalanine derivatives would follow a similar reaction<br>
pathway.<br>
[0073] Specifically, in Scheme 1, 5-atnino-2-diethylamino-4-substitutcd pyrimidinc,<br>
compound 1.1 (prepared from by corresponding 5-nitro-pyrimidinc by reduction with 5%<br>
Pd. C or 5% PtO2 by weight) is converted to the corresponding trifluoroacctamide,<br>
compound 1.8, by conventional methods. For example, a slight excess of trifluoroacetic<br>
anhydride is combined with compound 1.1 in a suitable inert diluent such as<br><br>
tctrahydrofuran, methylcnc chloride, pyridinc, and the like. The reaction is maintained at<br>
from about 0°C to about 30°C until the reaction is substantially complete which typically<br>
occurs within about 0.5 to 24 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the compound 1.8<br>
is recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the<br>
next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0074] Conversion of compound 1.8 to the corresponding N(R2).N-trifluoroacctamido-<br>
pyrimidinc, compound 1.9, again proceeds via conventional techniques. For example, an<br>
excess of the halide, R2-I, is combined with compound 1.8 in a suitable inert diluent such<br>
as DMF in the presence of an excess of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate. In<br>
one embodiment, approximately two equivalents of R2-l and potassium carbonate arc<br>
employed. The reaction is maintained under ambient conditions in a scaled container and<br>
is continued until the reaction is substantially complete which typically occurs in 20-72<br>
hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the compound 1.9 is recovered by conventional<br>
methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography,<br>
filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the next step without purification<br>
and/or isolation.<br>
[0075] The trifluoroacetyl group is then removed to provide for the corresponding<br>
am inc. compound 1.10. In this embodiment, the trifluoroaceptyl group acts as an amino<br>
protecting group. As above, this reactior conventionally proceeds, for example. bv<br>
contacting compound 1.9 with a large excess of a suitable base such a.s potassium<br>
carbonate in a mixture of water and a protic solvent such as methanol. The reaction is<br>
conducted at elevated temperatures such t.s 40° to 60°C and is continued until the reaction<br>
is substantially complete. Upon completion of the reaction, the compound 1.10 is<br>
recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction,<br>
precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the<br>
next step without purification and/or isolation.<br>
[0076] Next, conversion of the amine group in compound 1.10 to the corresponding<br>
alkylsulfonylamido group, compound 1.11, proceeds via conventional methods. For<br>
example, in one method, compound 1.10 is contacted with a slight excess of an<br>
alkylsulfonyl halidc in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine,<br><br>
diisopropylcthylaminc and the like in order to scavenge the acid generated. The reaction<br>
is preferably conducted in a suitable inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxanc.<br>
chloroform and the like. The reaction is preferably conducted at from about 0° to 30°C<br>
and is continued until the reaction is substantially complete which typically occurs in 2-48<br>
hours. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 1.11 can be recovered by conventional<br>
methods including neutralization, evaporation, extraction, precipitation, chromatography,<br>
filtration, and the like or, alternatively, is employed in the next step without purification<br>
and or isolation.<br>
[0077] The carboxyl protecting group of compound 1.11 can be removed by<br>
conventional conditions to provide for compound 1.12, a compound of Formula I. In one<br>
embodiment, a A-butyl protecting group can be removed by contact with formic acid. In<br>
another embodiment, a benzyl protecting group can be removed by contact with hydrogen<br>
in the presence of a palladium/carbon catalyst typically in a protic solvent such as<br>
methanol under elevated hydrogen pressures. Upon completion of the reaction, compound<br>
1.12 can be recovered by conventional methods including neutralization, evaporation,<br>
extraction, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, and the like.<br>
[0078] The invention also also includes esters of the compounds of this invention. The<br>
preparation of esters is illustrated in the various schemes described above, such as in<br>
scheme !. (compound ! .3), in scheme 2 'compound 1.7). and in scheme 3 (compound<br>
1.1 1). Furthermore. F.xamplc 1 describes the preparation of (S)-4-(3-tcrt-butoxy-2-(2-<br>
(dicthylamino)-5-(N-isopropylmethylsulfonamido)-pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-3-<br>
oxopropyl)phenyl pyrrolidinc-l-carboxylatc, and Hxamplc 4 describes the preparation of<br>
(S)-4-(3-tert-butoxy-2-(2-(dicthylamino)-5-(N-(prop-2-ynyl)mcthyl-<br>
sulfonamido)pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-3-oxopropyl)phcnyI pyrrolidinc-1-carboxylate. Esters<br>
of the acids of this invention can also be prepared from the acids by ways well known in<br>
the art. For example, amino acid methyl esters can be prepared using the method of<br>
Brenner and Hubcr, llclv. Chim. Acta 1953, 36, 1109.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0079] When employed as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of rhis invention arc usually<br>
administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compounds can be<br>
administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous,<br><br>
intravenous, intramuscular, and intrana.»,al. These compounds arc effective as both<br>
injcctable and oral compositions. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well<br>
known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
[0080] This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the<br>
active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of Formula I-II above associated with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of this invention, the<br>
active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipicnt. diluted by an excipicnt or enclosed<br>
within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other<br>
container. The excipicnt employed is typically an excipicnt suitable for administration to<br>
human subjects or other mammals. When the excipicnt serves as a diluent, it can be a<br>
solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the<br>
active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders,<br>
lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a<br>
solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of<br>
the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injcctable<br>
solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
[0081] In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active compound to<br>
provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the<br>
active compound is subMantially insoluble. it ordinarils is milled to a particle size of less<br>
than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is<br>
normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the<br>
formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
[0082] Some examples of suitable excipicnts include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginatcs, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium<br>
silicate, rnicrocrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and<br>
methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as<br>
talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil. wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoaies sweetening<br>
agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as<br>
to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration<br>
to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br><br>
[0083] Administration of therapeutic agents by intravenous formulation is well known in<br>
the pharmaceutical industry. An intravenous formulation should possess certain qualities<br>
aside from being just a composition in which the therapeutic agent is soluble. For<br>
example, the formulation should promote the overall stability of the active ingrcdient(s),<br>
also, the manufacture of the formulation should be cost effective. All of these factors<br>
ultimately determine the overall success and usefulness of an intravenous formulation.<br>
[0084] Other accessory additives that may be included in pharmaceutical formulations of<br>
compounds of the present invention as follow: solvents: clhanol. glycerol, propylene<br>
glycol; stabilizers: ethylcne diaminc tetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid; antimicrobial<br>
preservatives: benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben; buffering agents: citric<br>
acid/sodium citrate, potassium hydrogen tartratc, sodium hydrogen tartrate, acetic<br>
acid/sodium acetate, maleic acid/sodium malcate, sodium hydrogen phthalate, phosphoric<br>
acid/potassium dihydrogen phosphate, phosphoric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate; and<br>
tonicity modifiers: sodium chloride, mannitol, dextrose.<br>
[0085] The presence of a buffer may be necessary to maintain the aqueous pH in the<br>
range of from about 4 to about 8 and more preferably in a range of from about 4 to about<br>
6. The buffer system is generally a mixture of a weak acid and a soluble salt thereof, e.g.,<br>
sodium citrate citric acid; or the monocation or dication salt of a dibasic acid, e.g.,<br>
potassium hydrogen tartrate; sodium huirogen tartnue, phosphoric acid, potassium<br>
dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid, disodium hydrogen phosphate.<br>
[0086] The amount of buffer system used is dependent on (1) the desired pH; and (2) the<br>
amount of drug. Generally, the amount of buffer used is in a 0.5:1 to 50:1 mole ratio of<br>
buffcrdrug (where the moles of buffer are taken as the combined moles of the buffer<br>
ingredients, e.g., sodium citrate and citric acid) of formulation to maintain a pH in the<br>
range of 4 to 8 and generally, a 1:1 to 10:1 mole ratio of buffer (combined) to drug present<br>
is used.<br>
[0087] One useful buffer in the invention is sodium citrate/citric acid in the range of 5 to<br>
50 mg per mL of sodium citrate to 1 to 1:5 mg per ml., of citric acid, sufficient to maintain<br>
an aqueous pH of 4-6 of the composition.<br>
[0088] The buffer agent may also be present to prevent the precipitation of the drug<br>
through soluble metal complex formation with dissolved metal ions, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe. Al,<br><br>
Ba, which may leach out of glass containers or rubber stoppers or be present in ordinary<br>
tap water. The agent may act as a competitive complcxing agent with the drug and<br>
produce a soluble metal complex leading to the presence of undesirable particulatcs.<br>
[0089] In addition, the presence of an agent, e.g., sodium chloride in an amount of about<br>
of 1-8 mg/mL, to adjust the tonicity to the same value of human blood may be required to<br>
avoid the swelling or shrinkage of crythrocytes upon administration of the intravenous<br>
formulation leading to undesirable side effects such as nausea or diarrhea and possibly to<br>
associated blood disorders. In general, the tonicity of the formulation matches that of<br>
human blood which is in the range of 282 to 288 mOsm/kg, and in general is 285<br>
mOsm/kg , which is equivalent to the osmotic pressure corresponding to a 0.9% solution<br>
of sodium chloride.<br>
[0090] The intravenous formulation can be administered by direct intravenous injection,<br>
i.v. bolus, or can be administered by infusion by addition to an appropriate infusion<br>
solution such as 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other compatible infusion solution.<br>
[0091] The compositions arc preferably formulated in an oral unit dosage form, each<br>
dosage containing from about I to about 250 mg, more usually from about 5 to about 100<br>
mg, for example about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage<br>
forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects<br>
and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material<br>
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association witha suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
[0092] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally<br>
administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It, will be understood, however, that<br>
the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in<br>
the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen<br>
route of administration, (he actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response<br>
of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
[0093] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is<br>
mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present itnention. When<br>
referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br><br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughou: the composition so that the composition may be<br>
readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and<br>
capsules. This solid prcformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type<br>
described above containing from, for cxample, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention.<br>
[0094] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,<br>
the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and<br>
permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release.<br>
A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such<br>
materials as shellac, cctyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0095] The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may<br>
be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions suitably<br>
flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such<br>
as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
[0096] Compositions for inhalation or insjfrlation include solutions and suspensions in<br>
pharmaccutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and<br>
powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaccutically<br>
acceptable excipicnts as described supra. P-cferably the compositions arc administered by<br>
the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably<br>
pharmaccutically acceptable solvents may bo nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized<br>
solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device<br>
may be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine.<br>
Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or<br>
nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
[0097] The following formulation examples illustrate the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
(as 10% solution in sterile water)<br>
Sodium carboxymethyl starch	4.5 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	0.5 mg<br>
Talc	1.0mg<br>
[0105] The active ingredient, starch, and cellulose arc passed through a No. 20 mesh<br>
U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly. The solution of polyvinylpyrrolidonc is mixed with the<br>
resultant powders, which are then passed through a 16 mesh U.S. sieve. The granules so<br>
produced arc dried at 50°C to 60°C and passed through a 16 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium<br>
carboxymethyl starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed through a No. 30<br>
mesh U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a<br>
tablet machine to yield tablets each weighing 120 mg.<br>

Ingredient	Quantity (mg/capsule)<br>
Active Ingredient	40.0 mg<br>
Starch	109.0 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	1 0 mg<br>
Total	150.0 mg<br>

Active Ingredient	25 mg<br>
.Saturated fatty acid glycerides to	2,000 mg<br>
[0109] The active ingredient is passed through a No. 60 mesh U.S. sieve and suspended<br>
in the saturated fatty acid glycerides previously melted using the minimum heat necessary.<br>
The mixture is then poured into a suppository mold of nominal 2.0 g capacity and allowed<br>
to cool.<br><br>
Formulation Example 7<br>
[0110] Suspensions, each containing 50 mg of medicament per 5.0 ml dose are made as<br>
follows:<br><br>
[0111] The active ingredient, sucrose and xanthan gum are blended, passed through a<br>
No. 10 mesh U.S. sieve, and then mixed with a previously made solution of the<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymcthyl cellulose in water. The sodium<br>
benzoate, flavor, and color are diluted with some of the water and added with stirring.<br>
Sufficient water is then added to produce the required volume.<br><br>
[0112] The active ingredient, starch, and magnesium stearate are blended, passed<br>
through a No. 20 mesh U.S. sieve, and filled into hard gelatin capsules in 425.0 mg<br>
quantities.<br><br><br>
Formulation Example 10<br>
[0114] An intravenous formulation may be prepared as follows:<br>
Ingredient	Quantity<br>
Active Ingredient	250 mg<br>
Isotonic saline	1000 ml.<br>
[0115]| Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs<br>
transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdemnal patches may be used to<br>
provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in<br>
controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. Sec, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,023,252, issued<br>
June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for<br>
continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[0116] Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical<br>
composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques usually involve<br>
placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the<br>
blood-brain barrier. One such impiantable delivery system used for the transport of<br>
biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0117] Indirect techniques, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for<br>
drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs.<br>
Latcntiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxyi, earbonyl, sulfate, and<br>
primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and<br>
amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of<br>
hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-artcrial infusion of hypcrtonic solutions,<br>
which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.<br>
[0118] Other suitable formulations for use in the present invention can be found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA. 17th<br>
ed. (1985).<br>
[0l19] As noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in a variety<br>
of drug delivery systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo<br>
serum half-life of the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated,<br><br>
introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional<br>
techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the<br>
compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in,<br>
e.g., Szoka, et a)., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837.028 each of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0l20] Compounds having the desired biological activity may be modified as necessary<br>
to provide desired properties such as improved pharmacological properties (e.g., in vivo<br>
stability, bio-availability), or the ability to be detected in diagnostic applications. Stability<br>
can be assayed in a variety of ways such as by measuring the half-life of the proteins<br>
during incubation with peptidases or human plasma or serum. A number of such protein<br>
stability assays have been described (see, e.g., Vcrhocf ct al., Eur. J. Drug Metab.<br>
Pharmacokinet., 1990, 15(2V.83-93).<br>
[0121] The conjugates of this invention arc VLA-4 antagonists and arc contemplated to<br>
provide enhanced in vivo retention as compared to the non-conjugated compounds. Such<br>
improved retention of the conjugate within the body would result in lower required<br>
dosages of the drug, which, in turn, would result in fewer side effects and reduced<br>
likelihood of toxicity. In addition, the drug formulation may be administered less<br>
frequently to the patient while achieving a similar or improved therapeutic effect.<br>
[0122] The conjugates of this invention are anticipated to exhibit inhibition. in vivo, of<br>
adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells mediated by VLA-4 by competitive binding to<br>
VLA-4. Preferably, the compounds of this invention can be used in intravenous<br>
formulations for the treatment of diseases mediated by VLA-4 or leukocyte adhesion.<br>
Such diseases include inflammatory diseases in mammalian patients such as asthma,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, AIDS dencntia, diabetes (including acute juvenile<br>
onset diabetes), inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's<br>
disease), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tissue transplantation, tumor metastasis,<br>
meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, and other cerebral traumas, nephritis, retinitis, atopic<br>
dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury such<br>
as that which occurs in adult respiratory distress syndrome. The formulations of the<br>
present invention are especially useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease,<br>
such as Crohn' multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br><br>
[0123] Appropriate in vivo models for demonstrating efficacy in treating inflammatory<br>
conditions include EAE (experimental autoimmune enccphalomyclitis) in mice, nits,<br>
guinea pigs or primates, as well as other inflammatory models dependent upon <br>
integrins.<br>
[0124] Inflammatory bowel disease or "JBD" refers to the group of disorders that cause<br>
the intestines to become inflamed, generally manifested with symptoms including<br>
abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhea, weight loss and intestinal bleeding. 1BD is a<br>
collective term for two similar diseases ulceative colitis ("UC") and Crohn's disease<br>
("CD")<br>
[0125] Crohn's disease ('"CD") is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results in<br>
inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although any area of the GI tract may be<br>
involved, CD most commonly affects the small intestine and/or colon. In Crohn's disease,<br>
all layers of the intestine may be involved, and there can be normal healthy bowel in<br>
between patches of diseased bowel. CD is associated with fibrosis, stenosis and fissuring,<br>
fustulac between disease tracts and adjacent structures (i.e., bladder, other bowel segments,<br>
skin) and abecss. CD patients are typically p-esent with diarrhea, abdominal pain and<br>
weight loss. The abdominal pain usually is insidious and may be associated with a tender,<br>
inflammatory mass. Fever, weight loss, stomatitis, perianal llstulae and/or fissure,<br>
arthritis, and erythema nodosum are all commonly seen. There is considerable morbidity<br>
associated with CD, particularly in patients with disease not controlled by currently<br>
available drugs. Up to 75% of patients with moderate to severe disease require surgery and<br>
up to 75% ot these patients will experience pest surgical disease recurrence within 10<br>
years and up to 50% will undergo a repeat surgery within 20 years. This high rate of<br>
recurrence indicates a need for new effective treatments for foth active disease and<br>
maintenance of disease remission..<br>
[0126] Elcerative colitis or "UC" is a chronic, episodic, inflammatory disease of the<br>
large intestine and rectum characterized by bloody diarrhea. Ulcerative colitis is an<br>
inflammatory response limited largely to the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Ulccrative<br>
colitis can be categorized according to location: "proctitis" imolves only the rectum,<br>
"proctosigmoiditis" affects the rectum and sigmoid colon, "left-sided colitis" encompasses<br>
the entire left side of the large intestine, "pancolitis" inflames the entire colon.<br><br>
Lymphocytes and macrophages arc numerous in lesions of inflammatory bowel disease<br>
and may contribute to inflammatory injury. An exemplary animal model of inflammatory<br>
bowel disease (1BD) is carried out with HL A-B27 transgenic rats. These rats ovcrexpress<br>
the human HLA-B27 molecule (heavy chain and beta globulin gene) that is associated<br>
with spondyloarthropathics, a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the skeleton.<br>
Prior to onset of skeletal inflammatory changes these animals develop non-granulomaious<br>
inflammation in the small intestine and diffuse crypt abscesses on the colon, a pathology<br>
that is similar to that of Crohn's Disease in .lumans. Efficacy studies were performed in<br>
the HLA-B27 transgenic rat IBD model with compounds of this invention as described in<br>
Example J below.<br>
[0127] Asthma is a disease characterized by increased responsiveness of the<br>
tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli potentiating paroxysmal constriction of the<br>
bronchial airways. The stimuli cause release of various mediators of inflammation from<br>
IgiZ-coatcd mast ceils including histammc, eosinophilic and ncutrophilic chemotacJic<br>
factors, leukotrincs, prostaglandin and platelet activating factor. Release of these factors<br>
recruits basophils, cosinophils and neutrophiis, which cause inflammatory injury.<br>
[0128] Some appropriate animal models fo,: the in vivo study of asthma may include the<br>
rat asthma model, the mouse asthma model and the shcepmodel as described in Example<br>
Li.<br>
[0129] Achcroselerosis is a disease of arteries {e.g., coronary, carotid, aorra and iliac).<br>
The basic lesion, the athcroma, consists of a raised focal plaque within the intima. having<br>
a core of lipid and a covering fibrous cap. Atheromas compromise arterial blood flow and<br>
weaken affected arteries. Myocardial and cerebral infarcts are a major consequence of this<br>
disease. Macrophages and leukocytes arc recruited to atheromas and contribute to<br>
inflammatory injury.<br>
[0130] Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, relipsing inflammatory disease that primarily<br>
causes impairment and destruction of joints. Rheumatoid arthritis usually first affects the<br>
small joints of the hands and feet but then may involve the wrists, elbows, ankles and<br>
knees. The arthritis results from interaction of synovial cells with leukocytes that infiltrate<br>
from the circulation into the synovial lining of the joints. See e.g.. Paul, Immunology (3d<br>
ed., Raven Press, 1993). Overtime, bone erosion, destruction of cartilage, and complete<br><br>
loss of joint integrity can occur. Eventually, multiple organ systems may be affected.<br>
[0131] Joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis begins with the proliferation of synovia)<br>
macrophages and fibroblasts after a triggering incident, possibly autoimmune or<br>
infectious. Lymphocytes infiltrate perivascular regions, and endothelial cells proliferate.<br>
Neovascularization then occurs. Blood vessels in the affected joint become occluded with<br>
small clots of inflammatory cells. Over time, inflamed synovial tissue begins to grow-<br>
irregularly, forming invasive pannus tissue. Pannus invades and destroys cartilage and<br>
bone. Multiple cytokincs, intcrleukins. proteinascs. and growth factors are released,<br>
causing further joint destruction and the development of systemic complications. See,<br>
Fircstcin G.S. Etiology and pathogencsis of rheumatoid arthritis, Ruddy S, Harris ED,<br>
Sledge CB, Kcltey WN, eds. Kcilcy's Textbook of Rheumatology, 7th ed. Philadelphia:<br>
W.B. Saundcrs, 2005:996-1042.<br>
[0132] Appropriate animal models for the study of rheumatoid arthritis may include<br>
Adjuvant Induced Arthritis ("AIA") and Collagen Induced Arthritis ("CIA") as described<br>
in Examples G and H herein.<br>
[0133] Another indication for the compounds of this invention is in the treatment of<br>
organ or graft rejection mediated by VLA-4. Over recent years there has been a<br>
considerable improvement in the efficiency of surgical techniques for transplanting tissues<br>
.md organs such as skin, kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas and bone marrow. Perhaps the<br>
principal outstanding problem is the lack of satisfactory agents for inducing<br>
immunotolerancc in the recipient to the transplanted allograft or organ. When allogcneic<br>
cells or organs are transplanted into a host (V.c., the donor and donee arc different<br>
individuals from the same species), the host immune system is likely to mount an immune<br>
response to foreign antigens in the transplant (host-versus-graft disease) leading to<br>
destruction of the transplanted tissue. CD8" cells, CD4 cells and monocytes are all<br>
involved in the rejection of transplant tissues. Compounds of this invention which bind to<br>
alpha-4 integrin arc useful, inter alia, to block alloantigcn-induced immune responses in<br>
the donee thereby preventing such cells from participating in ihe destruction of the<br>
transplanted tissue or organ. Sec, e.g.. Paul ei al., Transplant Internationa/ 9. 420-425<br>
(1996); Georc7.ynski et al.. Immunology 87, 573-580 (1996); Georcyznski et al..<br>
Transplant. Immunol. 3, 55-61 (1995); Yang et al., Transplantation 60, 71-76 (1995);<br><br>
Anderson et al., APMIS 102, 23-27 (1994).<br>
[0134] A related use for compounds of this invention, which bind to VLA-4 is in<br>
modulating the immune response involved in "graft versus host" disease ("GVHD'"). See<br>
e.g., Schlegel et al., J. Immunol. 155, 3856-3865 (1995). GVHD is a potentially fatal<br>
disease that occurs when immunologically competent cells arc transferred to an allogcncic<br>
recipient. In this situation, the donor's immunocompctent cells may attack tissues in the<br>
recipient. Tissues of the skin, gut epithelia and liver arc frequent targets and may be<br>
destroyed during the course of GVHD. The disease presents an especially severe problem<br>
when immune tissue is being transplanted, such as in bone marrow transplantation; but<br>
less severe GVHD has also been reported in other cases as well, including heart and liver<br>
transplants. The therapeutic agents of the present invention are used, inter alia, to block<br>
activation of the donor T-cells thereby interfering with their ability to lysc target cells in<br>
the host.<br>
[0135] A further use of the compounds of this invention is inhibiting tumor metastasis.<br>
Several tumor cells have been reported to express VLA-4 and compounds, which bind<br>
VLA-4 block adhesion of such cells to cndothelial cells. Stcinback ct al., Ural. Res. 23,<br>
175-83 (1995); Orosz et al., Int. J. Cancer 60, 867-71 (1995); Frccdman ct al., Leuk.<br>
Lymphoma 13, 47-52 (1994); Okaharact al.. Cancer Res. 54, 3233-6 (1994).<br>
[0136] A further use of the compounds of this invention is in treating multiple sclorosiv<br>
Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological autoimmune discus that affects an<br>
estimated 250,000 to 350,000 people in the United States. Multiple sclerosis is thought to<br>
be the result of a specific autoimmune reaction in which certain leukocytes attack and<br>
initiate the destruction of myclin, the insulating sheath covering nerve fibers. In an animal<br>
model for multiple sclerosis, murine monoclonal antibodies directed against VLA-4 have<br>
been shown to block the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothdium, and thus prevent<br>
inflammation of the central nervous system and subsequent paralysis in the animals.<br>
[0137] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of<br>
drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia. PA. 17th<br>
ed.(1985).<br><br>
[0138] The amount administered to the patient will vary depending upon what is being<br>
administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state<br>
of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications,<br>
compositions arc administered to a patient already suffering, from a disease in an amount<br>
sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its<br>
complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "therapeuticaliy<br>
efiectivc dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the rtisea.se condition being<br>
treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such<br>
as the severity of the inflammation, the age. weight and general condition of the patient,<br>
and the like, with reference to the appropriate animal model data, such as that provided<br>
herein. Methods for estimating appropriate human dosages, based on such data, are<br>
known in the art. (sec, for example. Wagner, J.G. Pharmacokinetics for the Pharmaceutical<br>
Scientist. Tcchnomic, Inc., Lancaster, PA 1993).<br>
[0139] The conditions administered tg a patient arc in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
composites described above. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional<br>
.sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be<br>
packaged for use as is, or lyophulized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a<br>
sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration<br>
[0140] Compounds having the desired biological activity may be modified is necessary<br>
to provide desired properties such as improved pharnucological progenies(e.g., in vivo<br>
stability, bio-availability), or the ability to be detected in diagnostic applications. Stability<br>
can be assayed in a variety of ways such us by meaning the half-life of the proteins<br>
during incubation with peptidascs or human plasma or .scrum. A number of such protein<br>
stability assays have been described (see, e.g., Verhoef et al., Eur. J. Drug Metab.<br>
Pharmacokinct., 1990 15(2):83-93).<br>
[014l] The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention will vary<br>
according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner<br>
of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the<br>
judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for intravenous administration, the<br>
dose will typically be in the range of about 20 μg to about 2000 μg per kilogram body<br>
weight, preferably about 20 ug to about 500 μg, more preferably about 100 μg to about<br><br>
300 μg per kilogram body weight. Suitab c dosage ranges for intranasal administration arc<br>
generally about 0.1 pg to 1 mg per kilogram body weight. Effective doses can be<br>
extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test<br>
systems.<br>
[0142] Compounds of this invention arc also capable of binding or antagonizing the<br>
actions of α4β1, and α4β7 integrins. Accordingly, compounds of this invention are also<br>
useful for preventing or reversing the symptoms, disorders or diseases induced by the<br>
binding of these integrins to their respective ligands.<br>
[0143] In another aspect of the inventior, the compounds and compositions described<br>
herein can be used to inhibit immune cell migration from the bloodstream to the central<br>
nervous system in the instance of, for example, multiple sclerosis, or to areas which result<br>
in inflammatory-induced destruction of the myclin. Preferably, these reagents inhibit<br>
immune cell migration in a manner that inhibits demyelination and that further may<br>
promote rcmyelination. The reagents may also prevent demyelination and promote<br>
rcmyelinalion of the central nervous system for congenital metabolic disorders in which<br>
infiltrating immune cells affect the development myclin sheath, mainly in the CNS. The<br>
reagents preferably also reduce paralysis when administered to a subject with paralysis<br>
induced by a demyelinating disease or condition.<br>
[0144] Inflammatory disease that are included for treatment by the compositions,<br>
compounds and methods disclosed herein include generally conditions relating to<br>
demyelination. Histologically, myclin abnormalities arc either demyelinating or<br>
dysmyclinating. Demyelination implies the destruction of myclin. Dysmyelination refers<br>
to defective formation or maintenance of myclin resulting from dysfunction of the<br>
oligodendrocytes. Preferably, the compositions and methods disclosed herein are<br>
contemplated to treat diseases and conditions relating to demyelination and aid with<br>
rcmyelination. Additional diseases or conditions contemplated for treatment include<br>
meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord injuries and conditions generally which induce<br>
demyelination as a result of an inflammatory response.<br>
|0145| The compositions, compounds and cocktails disclosed herein are contemplated<br>
for use in treating conditions and diseases associated with demyelination. Diseases and<br>
conditions involving demyelination include, but are not limited to. multiple sclerosis.<br><br>
congenital metabolic disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria (PKU), Tay-Sachs disease,<br>
Nicmann-Pick disease, Gauchcr's disease, Hurlcr's syndrome, Krabbe's disease and other<br>
leukodystrophies that impact the developing sheath), neuropathies with abnormal<br>
myclination (e.g., Guillain Barre. chronic immune demyclinating polyneuropathy (CIDP),<br>
multifocal CIDP, Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN), anti-MAG (Myclin-Associatcd<br>
Glycoprotein) syndrome, GALOP (Gait disorder, Autoantibody, Late-age, Onset,<br>
Polyneuropathy) syndrome, anti-sulfatide antibody syndrome, anti-GM2 antibody<br>
syndrome, POFMS (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Fndocrinopathy, M-Protcin and Skin<br>
changes) syndrome also known as Crow-Fukasc Syndrome and Takatsuki disease,<br>
pcrineuritis, IgM anti-GDIb antibody syndrome), drug related demyclination (e.g., caused<br>
by the administration of chloroquine, FK506, pcrhexilinc, procainamidc, and zimeldine),<br>
other hereditary demyclinating conditions (e.g., carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein,<br>
Cockayne's syndrome, congenital hypomyelinating, congenital muscular dystrophy.<br>
Harbor's disease, Marincsco-Sjögren syndrome, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-<br>
Merzbacher disease, Refsum disease, prion related conditions, and Salla disease) and other<br>
demyclinating conditions (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis (also known as acute disseminated<br>
cnccphalomyclitis, ADEM), or spinal cord injury) or diseases.<br>
[0146] There arc various disease models that can be used to study these diseases in vivo.<br>
For example, animal models include but are not limited to:<br><br>
[0147] The most common demyclinating disease is multiple sclerosis ('"MS"), but many<br>
other metabolic and inflammatory disorders result in deficient or abnormal myelination.<br>
MS is a chronic neurologic disease, which appears in early adulthood and progresses to a<br>
significant disability in most cases. There arc approximately 350,000 cases of MS in the<br>
United States alone. Outside of trauma, MS is the most frequent cause of neurologic<br><br>
disability in early to middle adulthood.<br>
[0148] The cause of MS is yet to be determined. MS is characterized by chronic<br>
inflammation, demyclination and gliosis (scarring). Demyelination may result in either<br>
negative or positive effects on axonal conduction. Positive conduction abnormalities<br>
include slowed axonal conduction, variable conduction block that occurs in the presence<br>
of high-but not low-frequency trains of impulses or complete conduction block. Positive<br>
conduction abnormalities include ectopic impulse generation, spontaneously or following<br>
mechanical stress and abnormal "cross-talk" between dcmyclinated exons.<br>
[0149] T cells reactive against myclin proteins, either myclin basic protein (MBP) or<br>
myclin proteolipid protein (PLP) have been observed to mediate CNS inflammation in<br>
experimental allergic cncephalomyclitis. Patients have also been observed as having<br>
elevated levels of CNS immunoglobulin (lg). It is further possible that some of the tissue<br>
damage observed in MS is mediated by cytokine products of activated T cells,<br>
macrophages or astrocytes.<br>
[0150] Today, 80% patients diagnosed with MS live 20 years after onset of illness.<br>
Therapies for managing MS include: (1) treatment aimed at modification of the disease<br>
course, including treatment of acute exacerbation and directed to long-term suppression of<br>
the disease; (2) treatment of the symptoms of MS; (3) prevention and treatment of medical<br>
complications; and (4) management of secondary personal and social problem^<br>
[0151] The onset of MS may be dramat.c or so mild as to not cause a patient to seek<br>
medical attention. The most common symptoms include weakness in one or more limbs,<br>
visual blurring due to optic neuritis, sensory disturbances, diplopia and ataxia. The course<br>
of disease may be stratified into three general categories: (1) relapsing MS, (2) chronic<br>
progressive MS, and (3) inactive MS. Relapsing MS is characterized by recurrent attacks<br>
of neurologic dysfunction. MS attacks generally evolve over days to weeks and may be<br>
followed by complete, partial or no recovery. Recovery from attacks generally occurs<br>
within weeks to several months from the peak of symptoms, although rarely some<br>
recovery may continue for 2 or more years.<br>
[0152] Chronic progressive MS results in gradually progressive worsening without<br>
periods of stabilization or remission. This form develops in patients with a prior history of<br><br>
relapsing MS, although in 20% of patients, no relapses can be recalled. Acute relapses<br>
also may occur during the progressive course.<br>
[0153] A third form is inactive MS. Inactive MS is characterized by fixed neurologic<br>
deficits of variable magnitude. Most patients with inactive MS have an earlier history of<br>
relapsing MS.<br>
[0154] Disease course is also dependent on the age of the patient. For example,<br>
favourable prognostic factors include early onset (excluding childhood), a relapsing course<br>
and little residual disability 5 years after onset. By contrast, poor prognosis is associated<br>
with a late age of onset (i.e., age 40 or older) and a progressive course. These variables<br>
arc interdependent, since chronic progressive MS tends to begin at a later age that<br>
relapsing MS. Disability from chronic progressive MS is usually due to progressive<br>
paraplegia or quadriplegia (paralysis) in patients. In one aspect of the invention, patients<br>
will preferably be treated when the patient is in remission rather then in a relapsing stage<br>
of the disease.<br>
[0155] Short-term use of either adrenocorticotropic hormone or oral corticosteroids (e.g.,<br>
oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone) is the only specific therapeutic<br>
measure for treating patients with acute exacerbation of MS.<br>
[0156] Newer therapies for MS include treating the patient w ith interforon beta-lb.<br>
intcrferon beta-la. and Copaxonc" (formerly known as copolymer I). These three drugs<br>
have been shown to significantly reduce the relapse rate of the discase. These drugs are<br>
self-administercd intramuscularly or subcutaneously.<br>
[0157] However, none of the current treatment modalities inhibit demyelination, let<br>
alone promotes or allows spontaneous rcmyclination or reduces paralysis. One aspect of<br>
the invention contemplates treating MS with agents disclosed herein either alone or in<br>
combination with other standard treatrrent modalities.<br>
[0158] Radiation also can induce dcmyelination. Central nervous system (CNS) toxicily<br>
due to radiation is believed to be cause by (I) damage lo vessel structures, (2) deletion of<br>
oligodendrocyte-2 astrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes. (3) deletion of<br>
neural Mem cell populations in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex, and generalised<br>
alterations of cytokinc expression. Most radiation damage results from radiotherapies<br><br>
administered during the treatment of certain cancers. See for review Belka era!., 2001 Br.<br>
./. Cancer 85: 1233-9. However, radiation exposure may also be an issue for astronauts<br>
(Hopcwcll, 1994 Adv. Space Res. 14: 433-42) as well as in the event of exposure to<br>
radioactive substances.<br>
[0159] These conditions and diseases are also contemplated for palliative or<br>
ameliorating treatments.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0160] The following synthetic and biological examples arc offered to illustrate this<br>
invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius. In the examples below,<br>
the following abbreviations have the following meanings. If an abbreviation is not<br>
defined, it has its generally accepted meaning.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme 4<br>
[0162] In Scheme 4, compound 4 was prepared in a three pot sequence from the 5-<br>
nitropyrmidine compound 1. The synthetic protocol of Scheme 4 significantly simplifies<br>
the preparation of this compound by one or more of the following:<br>
1)	a substantially accelerated nitro group reduction step;<br>
2)	a streamlined reduction/reductive amination sequence that is performed in the<br>
same flask with the same solvent and the same catalyst, so manipulations arc reduced and<br>
exposure of the oxygen sensitive products to air is minimized;<br>
3) the conditions for the reductive amination step minimizes generation of a bis-<br>
isopropylamino pyrimidine side product thereby eliminating the need for a<br>
chromatographic purification of compound 3;<br><br>
4)	conditions arc described whereby it is possible to purify the mono-<br>
isopropylaminopyrimidine intermediate, compound 2, by trituration of the corresponding<br>
L-tartaric acid salt (though the need for this discrete purification of compound 2 also has<br>
been rendered unnecessary by the improvements in the reductive amination step), and<br>
5)	conditions for the discrete purification of compound 3 by crystallization from<br>
MTBE.-hexane or MTBE-cyclohcxane have been identified.<br>
[0163] In the reaction steps of Scheme 4, flash chromatography was performed using a<br>
Biotage Flash 751., using 800 g KP-Sil silica cartridges (32-63 μM, 60 angstrom, 500-550<br>
m2/g). R1s are reported for analytical thin layer chromatography, using EM Sciences Silica<br>
Gel 60 F(254), 250 μM thick plates for normal phase. NMR spectra were obtained on a<br>
Varian Gemini 300 MHz spectrometer (300 MHz for 'H spectra and 75 MHz for 13C<br>
spectra). Analytical HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC with a<br>
Phcnomcnex Luna, 3 μm, (2-18, 30 x 4.6 mm column. The detector was UV at 210nm.<br>
Solvents were 0.1% 'ITA in water and 0.1% TFA in acctonitrilc. The standard flow rate<br>
was 1.5 mL/min. and the standard method was named Ml with the solvent gradient<br>
changing from 20% CH?CN to 70% CHXN over 2.33 minutes. An alternate method was<br>
named M2 with a flow rate of 2 mL/min and a gradient changing from 20% CH3CN to<br>
70% CH3CN over 1.75 minutes. Method M15 had a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. with the<br>
solvent composition changing from 20% CH2CN to 70% CH3.CN over 10 min.. holding at<br>
70% for 2 min.. then ramping to 95% over 1 min. and holding at 95% for 2 minutes.<br>
LC/MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 Scries HPLC with a Series 1100 MSD with<br>
electrospray ionization (unless otherwise indicated as chemical ionization). The column<br>
and conditions were matched to the free standing HPLC.<br><br><br>
[0164] Nitropyrimidinc-carbamate (100 g, 189 mmol) and PtO2 (6.33 g, 27.85 mmol)<br>
were suspended in 360 mL of wet THF (5% H2O). The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature under hydrogen (60 psi). After 3 hours, TLC (50% EtOAc/hexancs on silica<br>
gel) indicated complete reduction of the nitro group (TLC analysis on silica with EtOAc<br>
showed Rf— 0.2 (streaky) for the amino-pyrimidinc and Rt= 0.86 for the starting<br>
nitropyrimidino-carbamatc.) In this regard, the use of PtO2 for both steps in this two-step<br>
process permitted a one-pot reaction with that added feature that the rate of reduction of<br>
the nitro group was dramatically accelerated, In any event, care be taken to minimize<br>
exposure to air/oxygen as the aminopyrimidine product is prone to oxidation.<br>
[0165] Ethanol (200 mL), acetone (21 mL, 1.5 cq.), and glacial acetic acid (3.0 mL, 0.28<br>
eq.) were added to the aminopyrimidine solution in the hydrogenation flask. After<br>
evacuaring and purging, the flask was pressurized with H2 (60 psi). The reductive<br>
animation was allowed to proceed overnight. I'LC on .silica using EtOAc a.s the eluant<br>
gave an Rr = 0.41 (streaky) for the isopropylamino-pyrimidine and an Rr= 0.11 for the<br>
starting aminopyrimidine carbamate. Both TLC and LC7MS confirmed complete reaction<br>
with virtually no bis-isopropylaminopyrimidine produced. If necessary, HPLC can be<br>
used as an alternative means to monitor progress of the reaction. The crude reaction<br>
solution was diluted with EtOAc (1 L) and filtered through a pad of basic alumina (400<br>
mL). The alumina was rinsed with KtOAc (200 mL) and EtOH (200 mL) and the<br>
combined organic solutions were concentrated in vacua. The flask was vented under N2<br>
The viscous oil was redissolved in anhydrous toluene (700 mL) and concentrated. After<br>
venting the flask under nitrogen, the product was dried again by azcotropic removal of<br>
another 400 mL of toluene. A viscous reddish-brown oil was obtained.<br>
[0166] As evidenced by the LC MS, very little bis-isopropylaminopyrimidine carbamatc<br><br>
impurity was produced with this procedure as compared to prior methods wherein the bis-<br>
isopropylamino pyrimidinc carbamatc mpurity required removal by chromatography.<br>
[0167] If a formal purification of the mono-isopropylamino pyrimidine 2 step is<br>
required, it can be precipitated from THF'ether as the (L)-tartaric acid salt and triturated.<br>
A small-scale example follows: (5.09 g, 99.6% yield) L-Tartaric acid (1.42 g) was<br>
dissolved in hot THF (45 mL). The ho: tartaric acid solution was added to the gum of the<br>
isopropylamino-pyrimidine 2 (5.1 g). 'rhe mixture was swirled and warmed until<br>
homogeneous. The solution changed from pink-purple in color to tan. The solution was<br>
concentrated in vacua to give a tan gum. Ethcr (~ 150 mL) was added whereupon oiling<br>
was observed. The ether mixture was concentrated in vacua. Acetone (~20 mL) and then<br>
ether (-200 mL) was added, and the formation of a gummy oil was again observed. The<br>
mixture was concentrated for a third time. Mcthylenc chloride (5-10 mL) was added<br>
followed by ether (-80 mL). A tan precipitate was observed to form underneath a bright<br>
orange-pink supernatant. The mixture was filtered. The precipitate was rinsed with ether<br>
(50 mL) and then again with a mixture (-60 mL) of acetone and ether (1:1). The<br>
precipitate was dried under vacuum overnight to give a cream colored solid (4.9 g, 76%<br>
yield). A small aliquot of the solid tartaric acid salt was dissolved in i-PrOH and EtOH<br>
and passed through a small plug of basic alumina to give the free base. The aliquot of free<br>
base was analyzed by TLC and LC MS. The remaining salt was suspended in a mixture of<br>
CH:C1: (250 ml.) and IN NaHCO, (150 mL). With mixing and some bubbling, the solid<br>
dissolved and the free base aminc was extracted into the organic layer. The aqueous layer<br>
was extracted once more with EtOAc (150 mL) and the organic extracts were combined<br>
and dried over MgSO4 (~150g). The dried organic solution was passed through a plug of<br>
basic alumina (-100 g) to give a light pink solution that was concentrated in vacua to give<br>
a tan-pink gum (3.28 g, 64% yield from starting nitrocarbamate).<br>
[0168] Several other acids were investigated in an attempt to form salts with the mono-<br>
isopropylaminopyrimidine carbamate 2. p-Tolucnesulfonic acid and mcthanesulfonic acid<br>
gave oils. Solid salts could be formed with HCI and H3PO4, but tartaric acid appeared to<br>
give the most favorable solubility characteristics. The HCI and phosphoric acid salts<br>
seemed to dissolve readily in a CH2Cl2, i-PrOH, and acetone, whereas the tartaric acid salt<br>
seemed to be mostly insoluble in CH2Cl2 and only partially soluble in the other solvents.<br><br><br>
[0169] lsopropylaminopyrimidinc carbamate 2 from Step ] (assume 189 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in pyridine (680 mL) and the solution was cooled to 0°C under N2.<br>
Mcthancsulfonyl chloride (44 mL, 3.0 cq.) was added via syringe pump over 20 min. to<br>
the cold pyridine solution of the isopropylaminopyrimidine carbamate. The ice bath was<br>
removed and the solution was allowed to warm to RT. The solution was allowed to stir<br>
for six hours. A small aliquot was removed and a mini-workup was performed (diluted<br>
with EtOAc, washed with 5% KH2PO4, brine, and then dried over MgSO4). Analysis by<br>
TLC showed the reaction to be complete and generally clean (only one spot besides a<br>
baseline spot from residual pyridine. The bulk reaction solution was concentrated. When<br>
650 mL of distillate had been collected, the blood red oil was diluted with EtOAc (2 L).<br>
The organic solution was washed with 5% KH2PO4 (1 L and 750 mL). 0.2 N citric acid (1<br>
L). and brine (1.L). T'he organic solution was dried over MgSO4 (150 g). The dried<br>
organic solution was filtered through a pad of silica gel (1 L.) to give a green-black<br>
solution. The flask and silica gel were rinsed with EtOAc (1.5 L) to bring the total volume<br>
of organic solution to 3.5 L. The solution was filtered through a pad of basic alumina (300<br>
mL) to give a deep green solution. The solution was concentrated in vacuo. A reddish<br>
gum (150 g) was obtained.<br>
[0170] The flask was flushed with nitrogen, capped and placed in the refrigerator<br>
whereupon a red-brown solid formed. LC/MS indicated acceptable purity, but TLC<br>
analysis indicated a bright red baseline spot as well as two to three very faint impurities.<br>
The odor of pyridine was still present. The red-brown solid was dissolved in a mixture of<br>
CH2Cl2 (100 mL), THF (200 mL), and ether (800 mL). The solution was filtcred/cluted<br>
through a pad of silica gel (1 L) and the silica was rinsed with ether (3 L). Most of the<br>
colored baseline impurity was retained on the silica gel. The solution was concentrated to<br><br>
give a red oil that dried to a pink foamy solid (100 g) that analyzed to be 94.7% pure by<br>
LC 'MS. The material was then chromatographed on silica gel (2 L) clutcd with CH2Cl2 (3<br>
L), CH2Cl2 and ether (1:1; 4 L), ether (4 L), cther: THF (1:1; 4 L), and EtOAc with 5%<br>
EhN and 2% EtOH (4 L). The CH2Cl2:ethcr eluent gave a red oil of mixed fractions (12.4<br>
g; Fraction A) and the ether eluent gave a tan oil (13 g; Fraction B) that was generally<br>
pure. The bulk of the material remained on the column and it was realized that the desired<br>
product had crystallized on the column. Elution with ethenTHF and EtOAc (with 5%<br>
Et3N and 2% EtOH) allowed the product to redissolve and clutc in concentrated plug<br>
(Fraction C) Fraction A and Fraction B were combined and concentrated together.<br>
Fraction C was concentrated separately. Upon concentrating and drying, crystals formed<br>
in both fractions. Further investigations found that the solid could be rccrystallised from<br>
methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), cyclohexane, cther-hexanc( 1:1), MTBE-hcxancs, or<br>
cyclohexanc-hcxancs. Combined Fractions A and B and Fraction C were each<br>
rccrystallizcd from MTBE-hcxancs to give the tert-butyl ester 3 as a white solid (57.75g<br>
total with a purity &gt;99%) and red filtratc/mothcr liquors. The mother liquors were<br>
concentrated to give a red oil (24 g). The mother liquor oil was chromatographed on a<br>
Biotagc 75 and clutcd with 4% THF in CH2Cl2 (12 L) to give enriched fractions that were<br>
then concentrated and re-crystallized to give an additional 14 g of purified tert-butyl ester.<br>

was dissolved and concentrated twice from 1.0N HC1 (250 mL and 200 mL). The product<br>
was twice dissolved in hot THF and concentrated to dryness to yield a foamy solid. The<br>

[0181] Nitro-carbamatc (compound 5, 10.8 g, 20 mmol) was slurricd in THF(35 mL;)<br>
and water (1 ml.. 3 ol%) was added. The solution was stirred, Adams cataksi ('0.360 g. 6<br>
mole of)) was added and the solution was de-oxygenated by three cycles of evacuation (50<br>
mm Hg) and refilling with dry nitrogen (10 psi). Finally, the reaction vessel was<br>
pressurized with hydrogen (60 psi) and reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for 90 min.<br>
If necessary or desired, progress of the hydrogenation reaction can be monitored by TLC<br>
(silica gel, cluting with dichloromethar.c:mcthanol (95:5)). Rr of nitrocarbamatc is 0.95,<br>
primary aminc - 0.16.<br>
[0182] The hydrogen was replaced by dry nitrogen (three cycles of evacuation and<br>
refilling with nitrogen). The ethanol (25 mL), acetic acid (0.3 mL) and acetaldchyde (1.2<br>
ml., 21 mmol, 1.05 eq) were added, vessel was partially evacuated at low prcsssures (ca.<br>
150 mm Hg) in order to minimize loss of the volatile acetaldchyde, refilled with nitrogen<br>
(10 psi) and reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 50 min. At the end of this time,<br>
nitrogen was replaced by hydrogen (60 psi) by partial evacuation and re-prcssurizing with<br>
hydrogen two times. The mixture was stirred for another 45 min. Progress of reductive<br><br>
amination may be monitored by TLC (slica gel, eluting with dichloromethane:mcthanol<br>
(95:5). Rt of primary aminc ~ 0.16, secondary aminc - 0.32 and tertiary aminc - 0.43. At<br>
the end of process, hydrogen was flushed out by three cycles of evacuation and refilling<br>
with nitrogen, the catalyst was filtered off on a bed of Celite using meihanol to rinse, the<br>
filtrates were stripped to dryness to give amber oil (11.9 g). The product is sensitive to<br>
oxygen, resulting in considerable darkening and appearance of low Rr material in TLC.<br>
All handling should be done with appropriate precautions.<br>
[0183] The reaction product was purified by flash chromatography using dichloro-<br>
methane:methanol mixture (97:3), containing 0.3% of ammonium hydroxide. Fractions<br>
containing N-cthyl product were combned to give 7.9 g of compound 6 as an amber oil<br>
(98.5% pure; 73% yield). The purity of the crude product appears to be adequate for many<br>
purposes, especially if product of the subsequent anticipated reactions is known to be<br>
crystalline.<br>

[0196] Aminopyrimidinf (2.0 g, 4.0 mmol - compound 9) (prepared by reduction of<br>
compound 1) was dissolved in dichloromcthane (10 ml.). THF (10 ml.) and tricthylamine<br>
(2.8 ml, 20 mmol) were added and the reaction cooled in an ice bath. Mcthancsulfonyl<br>
chloride (1.1 mL, 14 mmol) was added and the reaction warmed to room temperature over<br>
18 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacua and the residue taken up in<br>
ethyl acetate. The solution was washed with 0.2 N citric acid, water, sat. NallCO3, and<br>
brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacua to<br>
yield crude product as a brown foam. The residue was purified by flash chromatography<br>
(2:3 ethyl acetate hcxancs) to yield 2.2 g (73%) of the di-sulfonylatcd material as a yellow<br>

Example A<br>
4 Integrin Adhesion Assay: .lurkatTM Cell Adhesion to Human Plasma<br>
Fibronectin<br>
Procedure<br>
[0208] 96 well plates (Costar 3590 LIA plates) were coated with human fibronectin<br>
(Gibco/BRL. cat #33016-023) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. overnight at 4°C. The<br>
plates were then blocked with a solution of bovine serum albumin (RSA; 0.3%) in .saline.<br>
JurkatTM cells (maintained in log phase growth) were labeled with calccin AM according<br>
to the manufacturer's instructions, and suspended at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells ml, in<br>
Hepes. Saline/BSA. The cells were then exposed to test and control compounds for 30<br>
minutes at room temperature before transfer to individual wells of the fibronectin coated<br><br>
plate. Adhesion was allowed to occur for 35 minutes at 37°C. The wells were then<br>
washed by gentle aspiration and pipetting with fresh saline. Fluorescence associated with<br>
the remaining adherent cells was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader at EX<br>
485/EM 530.<br>
[0209] Cell cultures were prepared by first splitting the stationary phase JurkatTM cells at<br>
1:10 on day one and 1:2 on day two to perform assay on day 3. The cells split 1:10 on day<br>
one were split 1:4 on day 3 for a day 4 assay.<br>
[0210] The assay plates were prepared by first making a working solution of Gibco'BRL<br>
Human Fibroncctin (cat # 33016-023) in PBS+4, at 10 μg/mL.<br>
[0211] A Costar 3590 EIA plate was then coated with 50 μL well for 2 hours at room<br>
temperature (though it can also be left overnight at 4°C). Finally the plate was aspirated<br>
and blocked with Hepcs/Salinc Buffer, 100 μLwcll, for 1 hour at rt followed by washing<br>
three times with 150 μL of PBS + +.<br>
[0212] Compound dilutions were accomplished by preparing 1:3 serial dilutions of<br>
compounds as follows. For each plate '4 compounds/plate) 600 μL were added to 4 Bio-<br>
Rad Titcrtubcs in a Titertube rack. Enough compound was added to each appropriate tube<br>
to give a 2X concentration using methods well known in the art. Using Falcon Flexiplates,<br>
100 ΜL of Hepes Saline buffer or human serum were added to rows B through G. A multi-<br>
channel pipetter set to 180 μL was used to with four tips spaced evenly on the pipetter.<br>
Each set of tour tubes was mixed 5 times and 180 μL of 2X compound was transferred to<br>
the first column of each compound dilution in Row B, leaving Row A empty. 180 μL<br>
were added to the other wells in Row A. Serial dilutions were performed down the plate<br>
by transferring 50 μL to the next dilution and mixing 5 times, changing tips each time after<br>
mixing. Dilutions were stopped at Row E Row G had no compound present.<br>
[0213] A 20 μg/ml solution in HEPES'salinc buffer or human scrum, of 21/6 antibody<br>
was the positive control and was set aside in a reagent trough to add to cell suspension<br>
plate.<br>
[0214] The cell staining was accomplished by first harvesting the log-phase JurkatTM<br>
cells by centrifugation in 50 ml, tubes 11 100 rpm for 5 minutes). The cells were<br>
resuspended in 50 ml. PBS+ , spun, and resuspended in 20 mL PBS+. The cells were<br><br>
stained by adding 20 μL of Calccin AM for 30 minutes at RT. The volume was brought to<br>
50 mL with HEPES/salinc buffer and the cells were counted, spun, and resuspended to 2 x<br>
106 cells, ml. in HEPES saline buffer or human serum.<br>
[0215] The compounds were incubated using the following procedure. In a new<br>
flcxiplate, 65 μL of stained cells were added to Rows B through H. Then 65 μL of 2X<br>
compounds were added to the appropriate rows following the plate setup and mixed 3X.<br>
65 μL of 2X-21/6 antibody were added to Row H and mixed 3 times. Finally the plate<br>
was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br>
[0216] Fibronectin adhesion was measured using a fluorescent plate reader at EX<br>
485/EM 530 after the following work up procedure. After incubation, the cells were<br>
mixed 3X and 100 μL were transferred to the fibronectin coated plates and incubated at<br>
37°C for about 35 minutes. Each plate was washed, row by row, by gently pipetting 100<br>
μL of RT PBS down the sides of the wells and turning the plate 90 degrees to aspirate.<br>
This procedure was repeated for a total of 3 washes. Each well was filled with 100 μL<br>
after washing by pipetting down the side of the well.<br><br>
[0220] Cells were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed twice with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline ("PBS") containing 2% fetal bovine scrum and 1 mM each of<br>
calcium chloride and magnesium chlordc (assay medium) to remove unbound 15 7<br>
antibody.<br>
[0221] The cells were then exposed to phycocrythrin-conjugatcd goat F(ab')2 anti-mouse<br>
IgG Fc (Immunotech, Westbrook, ME), which had been adsorbed for any non-specific<br>
cross-rcactivity by co-incubaiion with 5% scrum from the animal species being studied, at<br>
1:200 and incubated in the dark at 4°C for 30 minutes.<br>
[0222] Cells were washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in the same. They<br>
were then analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell sorter ("FACS") analysis as<br>
described in Yednock et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270:28740.<br>
[0223] The data was then graphed as fluorescence versus dose, e.g., in a normal dose-<br>
response fashion. The dose levels that result in the upper plateau of the curve represent<br>
the levels needed to obtain efficacy in an in vivo model.<br>
[0224] The results of the a4-depcndent in vitro potency assay indicate that certain<br>
compounds of this invention when tested in this assay showed inhibition of 4 intcgrin<br>
at an EC50 of less than 20 μg'mL.<br>
Example C<br>
In vitro Assay For Determining Binding of Compounds to VLA-4<br>
[0225] An in vitro assay was used to assess binding of candidate compounds to <br>
intcgrin. Compounds which bind in this assay can be used to assess VCAM-1 levels in<br>
biological samples by conventional assays (e.g., competitive assays). This assay is<br>
sensitive to IC50 values as low as about I ΜM.<br>
[0226] The activity of  integrin was measured by the interaction of soluble VCAM-1<br>
with JurkatTM cells (e.g., American Tyoc Culture Collection Nos. TIB 152, TIB 153, and<br>
CKL 8163), a human T-cell line which expresses high levels of  integrin. VCAM-I<br>
interacts with the cell surface in an  integrin-dependent fashion (Yednock, et al. J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 1995. 270:28740).<br>
[0227] Recombinant soluble VCAM-1 was expressed as a chimcric fusion protein<br><br>
containing the seven extracellular domains of VCAM-1 on the N-tcrminus and the human<br>
igG1 heavy chain constant region on the C-tcrminus. The VCAM-1 fusion protein was<br>
made and purified by the manner described by Yednock, supra.<br>
[0228] JurkatIM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum, penicillin, streptomycin and glutaminc as described by Yednock, supra.<br>
[0229] JurkatTM cells were incubated with 1.5 mM MnCl and 5 μg/mL 15/7 antibody for<br>
30 minutes on ice. Mn-2 activates the receptor to enhance ligand binding, and 15/7 is a<br>
monoclonal antibody that recognizes an activated/ligand occupied conformation of <br>
intcgrin and locks the molecule into this conformation thereby stabilizing the VCAM-1<br>
a4 integrin interaction. Yednock, et al., supra. Antibodies similar to the 15/7 antibody<br>
have been prepared by other investigators (Luque, et al, 1996, J. Biol. Chcm. 271:11067)<br>
and may be used in this assay.<br>
[0230] Cells were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with candidate<br>
compounds, in various concentrations ranging from 66 μM to 0.01 μM using a standard 5-<br>
point serial dilution. 15 μL soluble recombinant VCAM-1 fusion protein was then added<br>
to JurkatTM cells and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Yednock et al., supra.<br>
[0231] Cells were then washed two times and resuspended in PE-conjugated goat P(ab'):<br>
anti-mouse igG Fc (Immunotech, Westbrook, Me.) at 1 :200 and incubated on ice. in the<br>
dark, for 30 minutc.v Cells were washed twice and analyzed with a standard fluorescence<br>
activated cell sorter ("["ACS") analysis as described in Yednock, et al., supra.<br>
[0232] Compounds having an IC50 of less than about 15 μM possess binding affinity to<br>
<br>
[0233] When tested in this assay, the compounds prepared in the above examples has or<br>
is expected to have an IC50 of 15 μM or less (or is expected to be active in vivo). A certain<br>
compound of this assay had an IC50 of less than 5 μM.<br>
Example D<br>
Cassette Dosing and Serum Analysis for determination of Bioavailability<br>
[0234] The oral bioavailability was screened by dosing rats with a cassette, i.e. mixture<br>
of 6 compounds per dosing solution. The cassette includes 5 test articles and a standard<br><br>
compound, for a total dose of 10 mg/kg. Each compound/test article was converted to the<br>
sodium salt with equimolar 1 N NaOH and dissolved in water at 2 mg/mL. The cassette<br>
was prepared by mixing equal volumes of each of the six solutions. The cassette dosing<br>
solution was mixed well and then the pH was adjusted to 7.5-9. The dosing solution was<br>
prepared the day before the study and is stirred overnight at room temperature.<br>
[0235] Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats from Charles River Laboratories. 6-8 weeks old,<br>
were used in this screen. Rats were quarantined for at least one day and had continuous<br>
access to food and water. On the night before the administration of the cassette, the rats<br>
were fasted for approximately 16 h.<br>
[0236] Four SD rats were assigned in each cassette. A single dose of the dosing solution<br>
was administered orally to each rat. The dosing volume (5 mL kg) and time were<br>
recorded and rats were fed 2 h after dosing.<br>
[0237] Blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture at the following time points: 4<br>
h, 8 h and 12 h. Immediately prior to blood collection, rats were anesthetized with CO2<br>
gas within 10-20 seconds. After the 12-hour samples were collected, the rats were<br>
euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.<br>
[0238] Blood samples were kept in heparinized microtainer tubes under subambicnt<br>
temperature (4oC) before they are processed. Blood samples uere eentrifuged ( 10.000<br>
rpm for 5 minutes) and pla»ma samples were remo\ed and stored in 4-20oC freezer until<br>
analyzed for drug levels. Drug levels in the plasma were analyzed using the following<br>
protocol for direct plasma precipitation.<br>
[0239] The in vivo plasma samples were prepared in a 1.5 ml. 96-well plate, by adding,<br>
in order, 100 μL of the test plasma, 150 ul of methanol. followed by vortcxing for 10-20<br>
seconds. 150 ΜL of 0.05 ng/μL of an Internal Standard in acetonitrile were added and<br>
vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[0240] The standard curve samples were prepared in a 1.5 ml. 96-well plate, by adding,<br>
in order, 100 μL of control mouse plasma, followed by 150 μL of methanol and sortexing<br>
for 10-20 seconds. 150 μl. of 0.05 ng/μl.. of an Internal Standard in acetonitrile were<br>
added and vortexed for 30 .seconds. The samples were spiked with 0-200 ng (10<br>
concentrations) of the compound of interest in 50% methanol to obtain a standard curve<br><br>
range of 0.5 ngmL to 2,000 ng/mL. Again, the sample is vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[0241] The samples were then spun for 20-30 minutes at 3,000 rpm in an Eppcndorf<br>
microfuge before 80-90% of supernatant is transferred into a clean 96-well plate. The<br>
organic solvent was then evaporated until the samples arc dry (under NS at 40oC 30-60<br>
min. (ZymarkTurbovap)).<br>
[0242] The residue was then dissolved in 200-600 L mobile phase<br>
(50% CH3OH/0.1% TFA). LC/MS/MS was then run using a PE-Scicx AP1-3000 triple<br>
quadurpolc mass spectrometer (SN0749707), Pcrkin-Elmer, Scrics200auto-sampler, and<br>
Shimadzu 10A pump. Acquisition was done with PE-Scicx Analyst (v 1.1) and data<br>
analysis and quantification were accomplished using PE-Scicx Analyst (v 1.1). A 5-50 μl<br>
sample volume was injected onto a reverse phase ThermoHypcrsil DASH-18 column<br>
(Keystone 2.0 x 20 mm, 5 urn, PN: 8823025-701) using a mobile phase of 25% CH3OH.<br>
0.1% TFA-100% CH3OH, 0.1% TFA. The run time was about 8 minutes at a flow rate of<br>
about 300 μL/minutcs.<br>
[0243] The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule<br>
from r-0 to the last plasma concentration sampling time tx (see Handbook of Basic<br>
Pharmacokinetics, Wolfgang A. Ritschel and Gregory L. Kcarns, 5th ed, 1999).<br>
AUC1 u - r'V(Cn - CY,) 2)) • (tn ; - tn) tin (uu mL)h]<br>
[0244] In the case of the cassette dosing paradigm, samples at 4.8 and 12 h post<br>
extravascular dosing, the AUC was calculated from t = 0 to t = 12 h.<br>
[0245] Each of the compounds in Examples 1-5 above when tested in this assay<br>
provided for an AUC of at least 5 ugh/mL when normalized for administration at a 10<br>
mg/kg dose.<br>

Asthma Models (El)<br>
[0246] Inflammatory conditions mod ated by  integrin include, for example,<br>
cosinophil influx, airway hyper-responsiveness and occlusion that occurs with chronic<br>
asthma. The following describes animal models of asthma that are used to study the in<br>
vivo effects of the compounds of this invention for use in treating asthma.<br><br>
Rat Asthma Model (E2)<br>
[0247] Following the procedures described by Chapman, et al., Am J. Rcsp. Crit. Care<br>

(1997), both of which arc incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0248] Ovalbumin (OA; 10 ug/mL) is mixed with aluminum hydroxide (10 mg/ml.) and<br>
injected (i.p.) in Brown Norway rats on day 0. Injections of OA, together with adjuvant,<br>
arc repeated on days 7 and 14. On day 21, sensitized animals arc restrained in plastic<br>
tubes and exposed (60 minutes) to an aerosol of OA (10 mg/kg) in a nose-only exposure<br>
system. Animals are sacrificed 72 hours later with pentobarbital (250 mg/kg, i.p.). The<br>
lungs are lavaged via a tracheal cannula using 3 aliquots (4 ml..) of Hank's solution (HBSS<br>
x 10, 100 ml; EDTA 100 mM. 100 mL, HEPES 1 M, 25 ml: made up to 1 L with H2O);<br>
recovered cells arc pooled and the total volume of recovered fluid adjusted to 12 mL by-<br>
addition of Hank's solution. Total cells arc counted (Sysmex microccll counter 1-500,<br>
TOA Medical Electronics Otd., Japan) and smears are made by diluting recovered fluid (to<br>
approximately 106 cclls/mL) and pipetting an aliquot (100 ul) into a centrifuge (Cytospin,<br>
Shandon, U.K.). Smears arc air dried, fixed using a solution of fast green in methanol (2<br>
mg/mL) for 5 seconds and stained with cosin G (5 seconds) and thiazine (5 seconds) (Diff-<br>
Quick, Browne Ltd. U.K.) in order to differentiate cosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages<br>
and lymphoevtes. A total of 500 cells per simer are counted by light microsopy under oil<br>
immersion 1x 100). Compounds of this invention can be formulated into a 0 5%<br>
carboxymcthylcellulo.se and 2% Tween 80 suspension and administered orally to rats<br>
which had been sensitized to the allergen, ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited<br>
allergen-induced leucocyte accumulation in the airways of actively sensitized Brown<br>
Norway rats are considered to be active in this model.<br>
Mouse Asthma Model (E3)<br>
[0249] Compounds arc also evaluated in a mouse model of acute pulmonary<br>
inflammation following the procedures described by, Kung, et al., Am .J. Respir. Cell Mol.<br>
Biol., 13:360-365, (1995) and Schneider, et al., (1999). Am J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.<br>
20:448-457, (1999), which are each incorporated by reference in their entirety. Female<br>
Black/6 mice (8-12 weeks of age) are sensitized on day 1 by an intraperitoneal injection of<br>
0.2 ml. ova/alum mixture containing 23 μg of ova (Grade 4, Sigma) and 2 mg inject Alum<br><br>
(Pierce). A booster injection is administered on day 14. Mice are challenged on days 28<br>
and 29 with aerosolized 1% ova (in 0.9% saline) for 20 minutes. Mice are euthanized and<br>
bronchavcolar lavagc samples (3 ml.) are collected on day 30, 48 hours post first<br>
challenge, liosinophils are quantified by a FACS/K1TC staining method. Compounds of<br>
this invention are formulated into a 0.5% carboxymethylccllulosc and 2% Twcen 80<br>
suspension and administered orally to mice which had been sensitized to the allergen,<br>
ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited allergen-induced leucocyte accumulation in the<br>
airways of actively sensitized C57BL/6 mice arc considered to be active in this model.<br>
Sheep Asthma Model (E4)<br>
[0250] This model employs the procedures described by Abraham, et al., J.Clin, Invest,<br>
93:776-787 (1994) and Abraham, et al., Am J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 156:696-703<br>
(1997), both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Compounds of this<br>
invention are evaluated by intravenous (saline aqueous solution), oral (2% Twccn 80,<br>
0.5% carboxymcthylccllulose), and aerosol administration to sheep which arc<br>
hypersensitive to Ascaris suum antigen. Compounds which decrease the early antigen-<br>
induced bronchial response and/or block the late-phase airway response, e.g. have a<br>
protective effect against antigen-induced late responses and airway hypcr-rcsponsiveness<br>
("AHR"). are considered to be active in this model.<br>
[0251] Allergic sheep which are shown to develop both early and kite bronchial<br>
responses to inhaled Ascaris suum antigen are used to study the airway effects of the<br>
candidate compounds. Following topical anesthesia of the nasal passages with 2%<br>
lidocainc, a balloon catheter is advanced through one nostril into the lower esophagus.<br>
The animals are then incubated with a suffed endotrachcal tube through the other nostril<br>
with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope as a guide.<br>
[0252] Pleural pressure is estimated according to Abraham (1994). Aerosols (see<br>
formulation below) are generated using a disposable medical nebulizer that provided an<br>
aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.2 μm as determined with an<br>
Andersen cascade impactor. The nebulizer is connected to a dosimeter system consisting<br>
of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer is<br>
directed into a plastic T-picec, one end of which is connected to the inspiratory port of a<br>
piston respirator. The .solenoid valve is activated for 1 .second at the beginning of the<br><br>
inspiratory cycle of the respirator. Aerosols arc delivered at VT of 500 mL and a rate of<br>
20 breaths/minute. A 0.5% sodium bicarbonate solution only is used as a control.<br>
[0253] To assess bronchial responsiveness, cumulative concentration-response curves to<br>
carbachol is generated according to Abraham (1994). Bronchial biopsies are taken prior to<br>
and following the initiation of treatment and 24 hours after antigen challenge. Bronchial<br>
biopsies are preformed according to Abraham (1994).<br>
[0254| An in vitro adhesion study of alveolar maerophages can also be performed<br>
according to Abraham (1994), and a percentage of adherent cells can be calculated.<br>
Aerosol formulation<br>
[0255] A solution of compound n 0.5% sodium bicarbonate/saline (w/v) at a<br>
concentration of 30.0 mg/mL is prepared using the following procedure:<br><br>
Procedure:<br>
1.	Add 0.5g sodium bicarbonate into a 100 mL volumetric flask.<br>
2.	Add approximately 90.0 ml. saline and sonicate until dissolved.<br>
3. Q.S. to 100.0 mL with saline and mix thoroughly.<br>
B. Preparation of 30.0 mu/mL Compound: 10.0 mL<br><br>
Procedure:<br>
1.	Add 0.300 g of the compound into a 10.0 ml. volumetric flask.<br>
2.	Add approximately 9.7 ml. of 0.5% sodium bicarbonate saline stock<br>
solution.<br>
3.	Sonicate until the compound is completely dissolved.<br><br>
4. Q.S. to 10.0 mL with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate / saline stock solution and<br>
mix thoroughly.<br>
Example F<br>
Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Rats<br>
[0256] Adjuvant induced arthritis ("A1A") is an animal model useful in the study of<br>
rheumatoid arthritis ("RA"), which is induced by injecting M. tuberculosis in the base of<br>
the tail of Lewis rats. Between 10 and !5 days following injection, animals develop a<br>
severe, progressive arthritis.<br>
[0257] Generally, compounds arc tested for their ability to alter hind paw swelling and<br>
bone damage resulting from adjuvant induced edema in rats. To quantitate the inhibition<br>
of hind paw swelling resulting from AIA, two phases of inflammation have been defined:<br>
(1) the primary and secondary injected hind paw, and (2) the secondary uninjected hind<br>
paw, which generally begins developing about eleven days from the induction of<br>
inflammation in the injected paw. Reduction of the latter type of inflammation is an<br>
indication of immunosupprcssivc activity. Cf. Chang, Arth. Rheum., 20, 1135-1141<br>
(1977).<br>
[0258] Using an animal model of RA, such as AIA, enables one to study the cellular<br>
events invoked in the early stages of the disease. CD44 expression on macrophages and<br>
lymphocytes is up regulated during the early development of adjuvant arthritis, whereas<br>
LFA 1 expression is up regulated later in the development of the disease. Understanding<br>
the interactions between adhesion molecules and cndothelium at the earliest stages of<br>
adjuvant arthritis could lead to significant advances in the methods used in the treatment<br>
of RA.<br>
Example G<br>
Collagen Induced Arthritis in Rats<br>
[0259] Purpose: To determine the efficacy of a representative compound of the<br>
invention ('"Compound A") administered by po bid dosing (Days (-1) -20) for inhibition<br>
of the inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone rcsorption that occurs in developing<br>
type II collagen arthritis in rats.<br><br>
[0260] Animals: 54 Female Lewis rats (Harlan), weighing 125-150 g on arrival, (inject<br>
50 with collagen to get 50 responders on days 10,11,12 for 6 groups of 10). The animals<br>
(10/group for arthritis. 4/group for normal control), housed 4-5/cagc, were acclimated for<br>
4-8 days. The animals were dosed at po3mg, kg bid, pol0mg'kg bid, and po30mg/kg bid.<br>
[0261] Materials: Agents or drugs in vehicle, Type II collagen, Frcund's incomplete<br>
adjuvant, mcthotrcxatc (Sigma), Compound A<br>
General Study Design<br>
[0262] Dosing was initiated on day m nus 1.<br>
[0263] The acclimated animals were anesthetized with isofluranc and given collagen<br>
injections (DO). On day 6 they were anesthetized again for the second collagen injection.<br>
Collagen was prepared by making a 4 mg/mL solution in 0.01 N acetic acid, l-qual<br>
volumes of collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant, were emulsified by hand mixing<br>
until a bead of this material held its form when placed in water. Hach animal received 300<br>
u.L of the mixture each time spread over 3 sites on back.<br>
[0264] Calipering of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints were done on day 9.<br>
On days 10-12, onset of arthritis occured.<br>
[0265] Rats were weighed on days (-) 1. 6. 9.10.11.12.13.14.15,16.17,18.19. and 20 of<br>
the study and caliper measurement* of ..inkles taken every day beginning on day 9. Final<br>
body weights were taken on day 20. Atier final body weight measurement, animals, were<br>
anesthetized for terminal plasma collection and then euthanized.<br>
[0266] Both hind paws and knees were removed. Hind paws were weighed, placed<br>
(with knees) in formalin and then processed for microscopy.<br>
Processing of Joints<br>
[0267] Following 1-2 days in fixative and then 4-5 days in decalcifier, the ankle joints<br>
were cut in half longitudinally, knees were cut in half in the frontal plane, processed,<br>
embedded, sectioned and stained with toluidine blue.<br>
[0268] Compound A demonstrated significant inhibition compared to controls receiving<br>
no treatmentof ankle inflammation and ankle histopathology at doses tested (3.0mg kg,<br>
10.0 mgkg and 30.0 mg/kg).<br><br>
Example H<br>
Induction of Colitis in HLA-B27 Rats<br>
[0269] The efficacy of the compounds of the present invention in reversing colitis was<br>
determined in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. HLA-B27 transgenic rats have been utilized as an<br>
animal model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease which mimics Crohn's Disease in humans.<br>
The rats ovcrcxprcss the human MHC class I HLA-B27 heavy chain and beta-2<br>
microglobulin proteins, which induces i variety of autoimmune diseases that include<br>
inflammation of the colon.<br>
[0270] The therapeutic effect of Compound A of this invention in resolving colitis was<br>
evaluated in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. Diseased rats were dosed subcutancously with<br>
l00mg'kg of Compound A of this invention twice a day for 16 days. Animal samples<br>
dosed with l00mg/kg of Compound A of this invention showed clinical and histological<br>
resolution of colitis and mimicked similar efficacy with the positive control group treated<br>
with anti-alpha4 antibody GG5/3.<br>
[0271] Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores indicated overall improved scores for rats<br>
dosed with l00mg/kg of Compound A of this invention and 10mg'/kg of GG5/3 (positive<br>
control) than rats dosed with vehicle. Fecal consistency and FOB scores for rats dosed<br>
with Compound A and GG5 .3 were satisfically different from the vehicle group.<br>
Induction of Colitis<br>
[0272] 20 HLA-B27 (6-9 weeks old) transgenic rats were ordered from Taconic. Rats<br>
acclimated in animal facility for 10 weeks. Animal bedding was mixed from different<br>
cages once a week to control for a "dirty" environmental flora.<br>
Treatments<br>
[0273] Rats were enrolled and randomized into four groups (n 5) based on weight and<br>
DAI scores (F'C &gt;3, FOB &gt;2). The experimental groups were dosed subcutancously with<br>
Compound A 100mg/kg (pH 2.8) twice a day for 16 days and terminated at trough. The<br>
control groups included a vehicle-treated (pH 3.2) group and a GG5/3 (mouse anti-rat<br>
aIpha-4 integrin antibody) positive control group dosed subcutancously at l0mg/kg (5<br>
ml., kg) on dO. d3, and d6 and terminated at trough on d8 (Table H1). Compound A and<br><br><br>
Endpoint Read-outs<br>
[0274] Disease Activity Index scores, Fecal Consistency test and Fecal Occult Blood<br>
test, were taken 4 times a week to generate in-life clinical scores. The primary read-out for<br>
the study was a histopathological analysis of cccum, proximal colon, mid-colon, and distal<br>
colon.. An IBD scoring system was applied (Table H2).<br><br>
[0275] Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores were lower for rats dosed with Compound A<br>
nnd GG5/3 (positive control) than the vehicle group. Fecal Consistency and Fecal Occult<br>
Blood Test AUC scores for Compound A and GG5/3 (positive control) dose groups wore<br>
also statistically different from the sueh elc.<br>
[0276] While some embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it<br><br>
will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
