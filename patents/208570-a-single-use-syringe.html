FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a single use syringe and particularly relates to a single use syringe where the syringe needle is biased into the synnge body after use<br>
BACKGROUND ARI<br>
Single use syringes are required to reduce the risk of infection caused by needle sharing   Many types of single use syringes are known.<br>
A disadvantage with most of these known syringes is the complexity of manufacture and the rather large number of parts which are required in order tn allow the syringe to be used effectively.<br>
This invention is directed to a single use syringe of the type which has a needle which can be shot into a hollow plunger stem upon completion of the plunger stroke to prevent the needle from being used again In particular, the invention is directed to a relatively simply insert which is fitted into the needle and which can securely hold the needle in its USE position but which can release the needle to shoot the needle back into the plunger stem.<br>
These types of syringes are known. One type of syringe which shoots the needle back into the syringe body is extremely complicated and has up to 1G parts which must be assembled to form the finished syringe. Some of the parts need to be glued as the parts are too small for injection or die moulding. This known syringe is also restricted to volumes of larger than 3ml as the various parts cannnt be marie to fit smaller syringes.<br>
Another disadvantage with known syringes ot this type is the inability to easily and readily injection mould the various components. For instance, a syringe having a shoot back needle is known where a spring biased needle is held in place by a rupturable restraining means which is moulded as part of the internal wall ot the synnge barrel. In practice, it is found that such a barrel is extremely difficult to mould and is virtually impossible to injection mould. Thus, this type of syringe cannot be manufactured cheaply<br><br>
2<br>
Another type of safety syringe having a spring mounted needle which shoots back into the plunqer stem has a needle held in place by a detormable base.  The deformable base has a constricted passageway which grips a peculiarly designed needle which has inter alia a circular flange attached to it.  The deformable member is pushed forward by the plunger and in doing so, it is pushed forwardly into an area of larger cross-section which allows the deformable member to expand which in turn allows the needle to pass through the passageway in the deformable member and to shoot back into the planner stem    II is believed that this type of arrangement would not be particularly reliable as it does not include a more reliable frangible portion which is broken to allow the spring biased needle to shoot back into the plunger stem.<br>
Safety syringes having shoot back needles are also known where the needle is not biased by a spnng. Instead, a vacuum is provided in the barrel to suck the needle back into the plunger stem. This type of syringe is of course tairly limited in use to circumstances where suction can be provided.<br>
Another type of syringe has a plunger stem provided with a helical spring such that the plunger stem is biased to retract. The plunger stem is pushed along the barrel and against the bias of the spring When the front of the plunger stem strikes the rear of the needle, it locks against the needle. Release of the plunger stem will then cause the spring tn pull thp plunger stem back along the barrel thereby retracting the needle.<br>
It is known to provide single use syringes where the needle is spring biased and is held in place by a cuttable member. In order to ensure that the member is property cut thereby releasing the needle, a two-part cutting action is usually required. In the two-part cutting action, the plunger typically has a forward cutting edge and the front nf the needle also has some form of cutting edge and a double cutting action is required to ensure that the cuttable member is property cut to release the needle. It is found that attempting to cut a cuttable member to release a spnng biased needle is not always reliable and does not always work.<br><br>
3<br>
Another type of known single use syringe has a base member which grips an enlargement on the needle.    The plunger pushes the base member forwardly which further compresses a spring which is around the needle.  The pushing action releases the grip between the base member and the enlargement on the needle.    This allows the needle containing the enlargement to be shot back into the plunger while leaving the spring behind. The spnng is initially compressed partially but then becomes compressed fully as the plunger forces the base member forwardiy.   This arrangement requires a needle having a special design (containing an enlargement) which means that conventional needles cannot be used.<br>
Another type of syringe has a plunger seal which moves on the plunger and where the plunger seal slides rearwardly along a bearing surface in response to a force being applied to the seal which is in excess of the operational force of the syringe. This arrangement begins the retraction sequence of the needle With this arrangement, a specially designed plunger seat is required which moves relative to the plunger. Conventional plungers have a plunger seal which is fixed tn the plunger.<br>
Another type of syringe has a shoot back arrangement which consists of two parts which slide relative to each other to release the needle. The two parts consist of an outer part and an inner part. The inner part holds the needle and is biased by a helical spring. The two parts are held together by frictional engagement to each other. A plunger progressively pushes the outer part forwardly thereby progressively reducing the amount of frictional engagement between the outer part and the inner part until such time that the bias of the spring is sufficient to shoot the inner part away from frictional engagement with the outer part. This arrangement requires a sliding frictional grip to hold the two-part together which is considered quite nsky and requires careful manufacture.<br>
Another arrangement uses a needle holder having an elongate body portion in front and a head end in hack and providing a spring under the hood end which circumscribes the needle holder. The use of an elongate body In a needle holder makes this arrangement difficult fur use in small and<br><br>
confined spaces<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a single use syringe havinq a spring biased needle which can shoot back into a hollow plunger stem after use.    The needle is held in place against the bias of the spring by a particularly designed holding means     The hofding means has a frangible portion which can be broken to release the needle and to allow the needle to shoot back into the plunger stem    In this invention, the frangible portion is broken by a stretching action which bursts the frangible member rather than a cutting action which is found to be much less reliable.   The holder can he formed separately and inserted into the syringe thereby doing away with the requirement for complicated or difficult to mould integral portions    This also allows  much  of the  syringe  to  be  formed   of conventional  inexpensive components or from components which require only minor mortification and which can be made inexpensively especially by injection moulding.<br>
Thus, one form of the invention has a syringe having relatively few parts being a plunger, a barrel, a needle attached to a needle holder, and a particularly designed holding means having a frangible portion which can be stretched to breaking point to release the needle.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a single use syringe which may overcome the abovementioned disadvantages or provide the public with a useful or commercial choice.<br>
In one form, the invention resides in a syringe body comprising a barrel,<br>
(a)	a plunger slideable in the barrel, the plunger having a plunger<br>
head and an elongate stem, the stem having an extending longitudinal passageway which has an open end which ss sealed by trangible portion on the plunger head,<br>
(b)	a hollow needle,<br>
(c)	biasing means about the needle to bias the needle into the<br>
barrel,<br>
(d)	holding means which is formed separately from the barrel and<br><br>
which is positioned inside a forward portion of the syringe and which holds the needle against movement into the barrel, the holding means having a first part which is able to be pushed forwardly by the plunger, a second stationary part to which the needle is attached, and.<br>
(e)	a frangible portion interconnecting the first and second pans<br>
and which is broken when the first part is pushed forwardly to allow the biasing means to bios the ncedlo into the longitudinal passageway in the stem<br>
Preferably, the first part is an outer body of the holding means.<br>
Preferably, the second part is an inner member of the holding<br>
means.<br>
The hollow needle may have an internal end which is associated with an extension which passes into the barrel and which can weaken or pierce the frangible portion on the plunger head to facilitate passage of the needle into the plunger stem. The extension may form part of<br>
the holding means.<br>
In another form the invention resides in a holding means for holding a medical needle, the holding means having a first part in the form of an outer cylindrical body, a second pan in the form of an inner member, the first part and the second part being interconnected by a frangible portion, the inner part having a passageway to fit the end of the needle<br>
Preferably, the longitudinal passageway in the stem is tapered to grip and hold the needle in the passageway<br>
The single use syringe has a hollow needle which is biased to shoot into the passageway in the plunger stem, but where the needle is held back by a holding means. The holding means has a weak, frangible. pierceable. or other type of breakable portion which, when broken. will cause the needle to shoot into the plunger stem.<br>
The frangible portion can be tauten by a means on the plunger      (typically adjacent a forwardmost portion of the plunger) such that as me plunger is pushed towards the end of the barrel, it will stretch and break the frangible portion to cause the needle to shoot into the plunger stem<br><br>
6<br>
The plunger has a plunger head, a portion of which can be pierced by the needle or extension. This portion can be a frangible portion or a relatively thin portion on the plunger head.<br>
Thus, as the plunger is pushed towards the end of the barrel, the extension on the needle can contact the frangible portion on the plunger head at about the same time that the means on the plunger begins to stretch the frangible portion on the holding means. Firmly pushing the plunger against the end of the barrel can cause the needle or extension to pierce through the frangible portion on the plunger head as well as causing the needle to become free TO allow It to shoot into the hollow plunger stem.<br>
The syrinqe body has a barrel which is typically cylindrical and which can be of various diameters and lengths depending on the volume of liquid to be held by the syringe. Typical volumes would be from between 1 to 10mm although larger and smaller volumes are envisaged.<br>
A plunger is provided which slides in the barrel The plunger has an elongate stem which can be formed from plastics material. The inner end of the stem has a plunger head which is usually formed of black resilient material such as rubber. silicone and the like.<br>
The plunger head, or plunger bung comprises a relatively thin portion (which can be called a membrane) which deforms and ultimately ruptures as the plunger is pushed against a forward part of the syringe it is preferred that the membrane is allowed to be form or stretch to substantially conform to the forward part of the syringe against which the membrane is pushed, prior to the membrane rupturing. The advantage is that virtually all the fluid in the syringe will be expelled through the needle and there will be little in no residual fluid left between the plunger head and the forward part of the syringe.<br>
The stem has an extending longitudinal passageway which has an open end which is sealed by a thin nr frangible portion or membrane which forms part of the plunger head. The internal passageway may extend entirely along the plunger stem and it is preferred that the passaqeway narrows towards the end of the plunger stem for reasons which will be descried in<br><br>
7 greater detail below<br>
As the longitudinal passage functions to hold the used needle, it is envisage that there may exist other combinations or configurations which may do a similar function. For instance, the plunger stem, Instead nf having a hollow passageway, may be provided with a longitudinal groove or slot which can have means to hold the needle.    The Internal wall of the barrel may function in cooperation with the plunger stem to define part or all of the longitudinal passageway in which the needle passes. However. If is preferred that   the   stem   itself  is   substantially   hollow  to   define   the   longitudinal passageway.<br>
The wall of the hollow passageway may have a necked area which contains at least one opening. The shot back needle assembly may have an edge which deforms as the needle assembly shoots back through the stem but which can expand into the opening to lock the needle assembly to the stem. This can prevent the noodle assembly from being easily removed or from falling accidentally out of the stem and presenting a sharps hazard.<br>
The syringe has a hollow needle. The hollow needle is attached to the holding means. The holding means may be provided with an extension which extends into the barrel to assist in stretching and rupturing the frangible portion on the plunger head.<br>
A biasing means is provided to bias the needle into the barrel The biasing means may comprise a spring which may extend about the needle body and which may be compressed when the needle is fitted to the syringe such that the needle is naturally biased to shoot into the longitudinal passage. The spring may extend at least partially about the holding means which is described below.<br>
A holding means is provided. The holding means may be in The form of a small plastic or other member. The holding means is attached to the synnge and is preferably attached adjacent the inner end of the needle The holding means can grip the needle to prevent the needle from shooting into the longitudinal passage under the influence of the biasing means. The holding  means has a frangible,  breakable,  pierceable, or other type  of<br><br>
arrangement which can be broken or removed to release the nccdic such that it can pass into the longitudinal passageway under (he bias of the biasing means. The frangible portion may be in the form of an area of reduced thickness on the holding means.<br>
The holding means comprises a first part which is able to be pushed forwardly by the plunger and a second part to which the needle is attached and which typically does not move relative to the first part. The first part may comprise an outer body and the second part may comprise an inner member. The frangible portion can interconnect the first and second parts and is designed such that when the first part is pushed forward/y relative to the second part, the trangible portion is stretched to breaking point.<br>
The frangible portion may be formed integrally with the first part and the second part- The frangible portion may have an upper Breakthrough edge and a lower breakthrough edge. The upper breakthrough edge typically faces the plunger while the lower breakthrough edge typically faces the spring. The upper breakthrough edge may comprise an annular groove or recess of smaller size and the lower breakthrough edge may compose an annular groove or recess of larger size. The upper breakthrough edge is preferably located on the outside of the lower breakthrough edge when viewed in section.<br>
A means may be provided which can be  on the plunger to break the frangible portion of the holding means to release the needle. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to the drawings and initially to figure 1, there is illustrated a single use syringe 10, which like other syringes has a barrel 11. a slidable plunger which is formed from a plunger head 12 and plunqer stem 13. and a hollow needle 14.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the forward part of the syringe in greater detail. The elongate plunger stem 13 is holtow to define an internal longitudinal passageway 15 with the end 10 (see Figure 1, of the passageway 15 being tapered for reasons which win be described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
The front of passageway 15 is capped or sealed by a frangible<br>
portion 17 of plunger head 12.  Portion 17 is frangible in the sense that there exists a thin-walled portion 18 whirh can ho perforated. This portion can also<br><br>
10<br>
be seen as a membrane Stem 13 has a forward area 19 to which plunger head 12 is fitted. Forward area 19 has an annular leading edge 20 which in (he embodiment functions as a means to break the frangible portion.<br>
Needle 14 is biased by a biasing means in the form of a helical spring 21 extending about the needle body, the spring being positioned in the nipple area 22 of the syringe. Spnng 21 has one end 23 abutting against an internal wall of nipple area 22, and has another end 24 pushing against the back of a holding means.<br>
Needle 14 is held in place by a holding means in the form of a resilient cap 26 or holding means . Cap 26 has an annular outer body 25 which can slide forwardly along a formed recess 22A (see Figures 5 to 8) in the nipple area 22 of the syringe. Cap 26 has a second part in the fnrm of an inner sacrificial member 27 formed with a tubular passageway which grips against the outside of the internal end 28 of needle 14.<br>
Sacrificial member 27 is separated from body 25 by a thin wailed annular frangible portion 29 Sacrificial member 27 has an extension 27A which is cone-shaped and which extends into the barrel. Extension 27A has a longitudinal bore 27B which communicates with the needle to allow the contents of the barrel to pass through bore 27B and through the needle.  Referring to Figure 3. in this figure. the plunger head 12 is being pushed against the end of the barrel. The extension 27A is pushtng against, and is inwardly deflecting the frangible portion 17 on the plunger head At this point, the annular edge 20 of plunger stem 13 is pushing against the annular outer body 25. Continued pushing will lesult in annular edge 20 pushing the outer annular body 25 away from the sacrificial member 27 thereby sketching the frangible portion to bursting point, while at the same time, the sacrificial member 27 and the internal.end of needle 14 pierces through frangible portion 17 on the plunger head This is- illustrated progressively in higures 5 to 8.<br>
In figure 5, the plunger head is just contacting extension 27A. tn Figure 6. the annular firtQR ?0 of the plunger is abutting against an edge of outer annular body 25 but has not yet begun to push the outer annular body<br><br>
forwardly.   In Figure 7, further pushing of the plunger stem now causes the outer annular body ?5 ro he pushed fuiwaicjly along the formed recess 22A At the same time, the inner sacrificial member 27 is unable to move forwardiy as it ahuts against Ihe comuiessed helical spring around the needle also the mating faces of the tip and the body boss.   Figure 7 illustrates the position whnie IIIR frangible portion 17 is stretched to bursting point.   In Figure 8. the frangible portion has been burst which now allows the spring to expand tn shoot Hit; needle back into the piunger stem.   The needle is still fixed to the inner sacrificial member 27.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the sacrificial member 27 which gnps needle 14 has been released from the main body 25 "f enp 26 and spring 21 expands to shoot needle 14 along the hollow longitudinal passageway 15 in the plunger stem 13. The force of the spring is typically sufficient to shout (he needle entirely along the passageway until sacrificial member 27 becomes wedged in the tapered portion 16 in passageway 15 (Figure 1 illustrates the tapered portion). The needle is now held securely in the passageway and will not fall out should the plunger he removed fium the barrel.<br>
The sacrificial member 27 has at least one opening in ft which communicates with an opening in the needfestick wail such that when the plunger is in the position approximating that of Figure 3, (when the end of The needle is sealed by the plunger head), the last bit of liquid in the barrel can pass through the needle.<br>
Retelling to figures 9A-9B. there is illustrated a holding means according to an alternative embodiment. The holding means is formed from a single piece of material and comprises an outer part 30 and an inner port 31. Outer part 30 is cylindrical in configuration, has a substantially snltd upper wait 32 (which faces the plunger) and a substantially hollow inner portion 33. Outer part 30 and inner part 31  are connected by an annular thin wall frangibie section 34. To provide a good stretching and bursting action of this section 34, the frangible section 34 comprises an upper Uieakthfaugh edge 35  and  a lower breakthrough edge  36.     Upper breakthrough edge 3b comprises an annular recess in the uppei waff 32 . white lower breakthrough<br><br>
22<br>
origft 3fi composes an arum)m mcess which is an extension of the hollow inner poritcn 33. Both breakthrough edges 35 36 have an inner wan which is subslatMatty parallel with trie longitudinal axis of the synnqe^ and an outer wait which is inclined towards the inner wall to form a substantially triangular shaped recess. The breakthrough edges creates the relatively thin frangible portion which connects the outer part 30 with the inner part 31 Upper breakthrough edge 35 is positioned to extend on the outside of the inner wall of lower breakthrough edge 36 (when viewert in seennn) This positioning facilitates a reliable stretching and bursting action of the frangible section 34 Figure 98 illustrates the holding means after the frangiDle section I tab been burst<br>
inner part 31 has $ longitudinal passageway 37 Wuouyh which the needle (not illustrated) passes, tnncr part 31 has on extension 27A which is similar to that described in previous figures. In thin particular embodiment, when the outer part 30 has been separated from the inner part 31, edges are formec* 36. 39 which HXHI'SI IT* a locking ihts jshol back inner part into *ho plunger stem is wiif be described below.<br>
Referring !n figure in. this figure illusl/ales an embodiment of the invention lo securely hold or Jock the tip portion into the syringe barrel.   I he syringe barrel U has a reduction in the wall thickness 41 in a forward part of the syringe barrel. The reduction tn the waft thickness Ai makes this pan of thR barrel weaker and therefore able to Uefoim or bulge when the holding mcano ic pressed into this part of tho syringe.  This provides a very secure fil and a
 <br>
13<br>
manufacture.<br>
Figures   11A-C illustrate sequentially the deformation of the membrane 50 or the thin portion on the plunger.   Figure 11A shows plunger 51 approaching the end of syringe 52, this end containing the tip 53.  Plunger 51 has a front s"al 54 which has a thin membrane portion 55.   Figure 11B shows plunger 51 beginning to make contact with tip 53 and with membrane 55 beginning tn rip.fnrm inwardly. Figure 11C shows plunger 51 being pushed hard up against tip 53 with membrane 55 being sufficiently pliable to conform To The shapf.* of tip 53 thereby ensuring that there are no fluid containing voids between the membrane 55 and the outer face of tip b3.   This ensures that virtually all the fluid tn the syringe passes through the needle 56.    The membrane 55 stretches until the plunger is fully depressed and substantially all the fluid is expelled from the syringe leaving no  dead space" or wasted fluid.    At the point of full plunger depression, the elastic threshold of the membrane is overcome and the membrane ruptures to allow simultaneous movement of the inner part (spring-loaded) which contains me needle into me stem of the barrel (i.e. shooting back into the stem)<br>
Figures 12A and 12B illustrates a stem design according to an embodiment of the invention. The stem forms part of the plungor and contains a main body portion 60 and a forward portion 61 which has the plunger seal 62. A hoilow portion 63 ic provided to accommodate the detached needle assembly The detached neerile assembly is as described above and contains the needle 64, the helical spring 65, and the inner part 66<br>
of the holding means whirh has heen detached from the uuler patt. Hulluw portion 63 contains a nocked area 67 which has at least one opening 67A to provide an unrestricted location and as illustrated in figure 12A. Inner part 06 can be as illustrated in figure 9B and has an edge 38 which deforms as the needle assembly shoots tnrough the lapsed plunger stem. When the needle assembly passes opening 67A, the deformed edge 38 can expand into the opening to lock the needfe assembly to the stem<br>
The plunger stem can be provided with openings in the side wail to allow water to enter into the syringe after use which prevents the used<br><br>
1-4<br>
syringe from floating on water dependant on UIHIKMHI.   This may reduce the number uf used needles washed up on a sea shore.<br>
The single use syringe lisas relatively few parts and the parts can be assembled without the use of any adhesive. The arrangement works on a cutting and piercing action to release the needfe once the plunger head is pushed against the end of the barrel.<br>
IT should he appreciated that various other changes or modifications can be made to the embodiment described withoirt departing from the spirit anri scope of Ihe invention as claimed:<br><br>

WE CLAIMS<br>
1.   A single use syringe  comprising a barrel (11), and<br>
a.	a plunger (12,13) slideable in the barrel, the plunger<br>
having  a plunger head (12) and an elongate stem (13), the<br>
stem (13) having  an extending longitudinal passageway 
which has an open end which is sealed by frangible portion<br>
(17) on the plunger head (12)"<br>
b.	a hollow needle (14)"<br>
c.	biasing means (21) about the needle  to bias the needle<br>
into the barrel (11J t<br>
d.	holding means (20) which is formed separately from th* barrel<br>
and which is positioned inside a forward portion (27A) of the<br>
syringe and which holds the needle against movement into the<br>
barrel" the holding means (26) having a first part (25) which<br><br>
16.<br>
is adapted to be pushed forwardly by the plunger, a second stationary part (27) to which the needle is attached and a frangible portion (29) interconnecting the first and second parts (25,27) and which is broken when the first part  (25) is pushed forwardly to allow the biasing  means (21) to bias the second part (22) containing the attached needle  through the plunger head (12) and into the longitudinal passageway (15) in the stem (13&gt;,<br>
e.    said first part (25) of said holding means   comprises an outer part, and said second part of said holding means comprises an inner part,<br>
f.    said inner part (25) of said holding means , the rear end communicating with the inside of said barrel , the rear end comprising a tapered extension which extends into the barrel and which is adopted for contact with  the frangible portion on said  plunger head,<br><br>
17.<br>
9.   the frangible portion  (13) on **id plunger head 
h.   wherein  said frangible portion on said  plunger  head substantially  conforms  to the shape  of  the  tapered extension prior to breaking to facilitate expulsion  of all the liquid in the syringe.<br>
2. The syringe as claimed in claim 1, wherein the longitudinal passageway in the stem is tapered to grip and hold the needle in the passageway.<br>
3.         The  syringe  as  claimed  in  claim  2,  wherein  the longitudinal passageway is provided with at least one opening  in the  wall of the passageway, which is adapted to  engage with  the second  part containing the needle when the second part  is  shot back into the passageway.<br>
4. The syringe as claimed in claim l, wherein the biasing means comprises a helical spring which is attached to the second part.<br><br>
18.<br>
5. The syringe as claimed in claim 4, wherein the first part has a cylindrical outer face adapted for a eliding contact with a portion of the inner wall of the barrel.<br>
6. The syringe as claimed in claim 5, wherein the portion of the inner wall of the barrel has a thickness which is less than the thickness of the wall of a main body.<br>
7. The syringe as claimed in claim 1, wherein the holding means comprises a unitary member, and the frangible portion has an upper breakthrough edge which faces the plunger and a lower breakthrough edge, the edges comprising annular recesses in the holding means.<br>
9, The syringe as claimed in claim 7, wherein the upper breakthrough edge is located on the outside of the lower breakthrough edge when viewed in section.<br>
The invention relates to a single use syringe (10) has a needle (14) which is biased back into the barrel (11) but which is prevented from doing so by a holding means (20) which has an outer part (25) and an inner part (27) which are connected together by a frangible portion (29). The needle is held by the inner part. When the plunger (12,13) is pushed towards the front of the barrel (11), it contacts the outer part and pushes it fprwardly which stretches the frangible portion until it bursts. When the frangible portion breaks, the inner portion containing the needle is released and can shoot back into a hollow portion in the plunger through the frangible portion of the plunger head (12).</td>
