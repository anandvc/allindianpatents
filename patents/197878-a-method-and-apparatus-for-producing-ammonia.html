   Brief Description of the Drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified schematic block flow representation of one preferred embodiment of the method of this invention wherein carbon dioxide removal is carried out using a pressure swing adsorption unit.<br>
       Figure 2 is a simplified schematic block flow<br>
representation of another preferred embodiment of the method of this invention wherein carbon dioxide removal is carried out using a hot potassium carbonate system.<br>
   Detailed Description<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the Drawings.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, feed air 1 comprised primarily of nitrogen and oxygen and also containing    other normal constituents of air such as argon, is<br>
passed into cryogenic air separation plant 101 wherein it is separated by cryogenic rectification to produce oxygen.  Cryogenic air separation plant 101 may be any<br><br>
effective cryogenic air separation plant. Preferably cryogenic air separation plant 101 is a double column plant comprising a higher pressure column and a lower pressure column in heat exchange relation wherein the   feed air undergoes a preliminary separation by<br>
cryogenic rectification in the higher pressure column into oxygen-enriched fluid and nitrogen-enriched fluid, and these fluids are then passed  into  the lower pressure column wherein they undergo a final separation<br>
  by cryogenic rectification into product oxygen and<br>
product nitrogen.  The cryogenic air separation plant may also employ other columns such as an argon sidearm column wherein product argon may be produced. Nitrogen is withdrawn from cryogenic air<br>
   separation plant 101 in stream 4 which may be<br>
recovered, in whole or in part, or released to the atmosphere.  Product oxygen, having an oxygen concentration ranging from that of enriched air to higher purity, i.e. generally within the range of from<br>
   40 to 99.9 mole percent, is withdrawn from cryogenic air separation plant in stream 6.  The oxygen from the cryogenic air separation plant is mixed with air from stream 7 to produce oxygen-enriched air or blast air 8. The blast air has an oxygen concentration generally<br>
   within the range of from 22 to 50 mole percent with the remainder comprised primarily of nitrogen.<br>
Blast air 8 is heated in stoves 103 to a temperature generally within the range of from 1500 to 2200°F and the resulting hot blast air 10 is passed<br>
   into blast furnace 104 along with hydrocarbon 12 which may be coal, oil or natural gas.  Also passed into blast furnace 104 is furnace charge 14 comprising iron ore, coke and flux materials.  The oxygen of the blast<br><br>
air reacts with hydrocarbon fuel within the blast furnace generating heat and producing a reducing gas which converts the iron ore to iron as the gas flows up through the furnace.  Molten iron and slag are removed    from the bottom of furnace 104 in line 13 and the gas, generally termed blast furnace gas and comprising nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, is collected in the upper portion of blast furnace 104 and withdrawn from furnace 104 is stream 15.<br>
       It is an important aspect of this invention that the blast air, while having an oxygen concentration which exceeds that of air, also contain a significant level of nitrogen, preferably of about 50 mole percent or more.  This accomplishes two beneficial results.  It<br>
   enables the blast furnace to operate without need for significant alteration from that of conventional practice wherein air is the sole source of oxygen, and also serves as a source of nitrogen which is beneficially employed downstream in the production of<br>
    ammonia.<br>
Referring back now to Figure 1, a portion 17 of blast furnace off-gas 15 is passed to stoves 103 wherein it is burned to provide heat to heat the blast air.  Another portion 19 can be used as fuel in other<br>
   units.  The remaining portion 16 of blast furnace off-gas 15 is passed into the lower portion of wash tower 107.  Water is passed into the upper portion of wash tower 107 in stream 18 and passes down wash tower 107 against upflowing blast furnace gas and, in the<br>
   process, particulate impurities within the blast<br>
furnace gas are washed into the downflowing water and the blast furnace gas is cooled to a temperature<br><br>
generally within the range of from 40 to 150°F.  The wash water is removed from wash tower 107 in stream 20.<br>
Cooled blast furnace gas is withdrawn from the upper portion of wash tower 107 in stream 22 and passed to compressor 110 wherein it is compressed to a pressure generally within the range of from 100 to 500 pounds per square inch absolute (psia).  The resulting pressurized blast furnace gas in stream 24 is mixed with steam at substantially the same pressure to form water gas shift reaction stream 28.  The steam in stream 26 is added to the pressurized blast furnace gas stream 24 at a rate such that the ratio of water to carbon monoxide in water gas shift reaction stream 28 is within the range of from 2 to 5.  Preferably,<br>
   streams 24 and 26 are each heated to about 600°F before they are mixed to form stream 28.<br>
Water gas shift reaction stream 28 is passed into shift reaction section 114 which preferably comprises high temperature and lower temperature shift reactors in series with heat exchangers after each shift reactor.  As the water gas shift reaction mixture passes through the shift reactors, the carbon monoxide reacts'with steam in an exothermic reaction to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen.  The resulting blast<br>
   furnace gas comprising nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen is then passed in stream 30  from water gas shift reaction section 114 to pressure swing adsorption system 118 which comprises one or more beds of adsorbent particles which preferentially adsorb carbon dioxide.  Among such adsorbent materials one can name activated carbon and zeolites.<br>
As the blast furnace gas passes through pressure swing adsorption system 118, carbon dioxide is removed<br><br>
from the blast furnace gas by being preferentially adsorbed onto the adsorbent.  The resulting fortified blast furnace gas comprising nitrogen and hydrogen is withdrawn from pressure swing adsorption system in    stream 32.<br>
Stream 32 may contain up to 500 ppm of carbon dioxide and will also contain some water.  Stream 32 is passed into methanation section 120 wherein the gas is preheated and then added to a methanator.  Within the<br>
   methanator all the residual carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen to produce methane.  The gas mixture from methanation section 120 is passed in stream 36 to dryer 123 for the removal of the water. Resulting fortified blast furnace gas is withdrawn from<br>
   dryer 123 in stream 40 and combined with recycle stream 58 to form stream 42 which is fed into cryogenic rectification plant 126.  Preferably cryogenic rectification plant 126 comprises a heat exchanger wherein the feed is partially condensed and then phase<br>
   separated to effect the separation.  However, the plant could combine the heat exchange and phase separation with further column separation.  Within the cryogenic rectification plant 126 the feed 42 is separated by cryogenic rectification into ammonia synthesis gas 46<br>
     containing hydrogen and nitrogen in about a 3 to 1 ratio with very small amounts of argon and methane, residual nitrogen 43 having a nitrogen concentration of about 98 mole percent with the remainder being mostly argon, methane and hydrogen, and impure hydrogen 48<br>
   having a hydrogen concentration generally within the range of from 10 to 50 mole percent.<br><br>
Ammonia synthesis gas is passed from cryogenic rectification plant 126 in stream 46 to ammonia production plant 129.<br>
In ammonia plant 129, ammonia synthesis make-up   gas and recycle synthesis gas are compressed and heated and then fed to an ammonia converter.  In the converter hydrogen and nitrogen react to produce ammonia.  Due to the exothermic reaction, heat is produced.  This heat is used to produce stream.  Per pass conversion into<br>
   ammonia may vary from 15-30%.  More steam is produced while cooling the converter outlet gas.  It is further cooled by exchanging heat with feed gas to the converter and then by cooling water.  Finally, a chiller is used to cool it further to separate liquid    ammonia product.  Gas from this separator contains<br>
unconverted hydrogen and nitrogen and inerts (argon and methane) .  A small portion of this gas is purged from the loop to prevent buildup of inerts.  One of the beneficial aspects of the invention is that most of the<br>
   inerts are removed (more than 95% methane and more than 85% argon) in unit 126 where ammonia synthesis gas is produced.  As a result, the amounts of inerts entering the ammonia synthesis loop are very small and hence the amount of gas that needs to be purged is very small.<br>
   Due to lower concentrations of inerts in the synthesis loop, per pass conversion to ammonia is also improved. The balance of gas (after purge gas is removed) is called recycle synthesis gas which was mentioned earlier.  Liquid ammonia product is throttled to a   lower pressure to release dissolved gas.  This gas and purge gas are combined and ammonia from it is removed by refrigeration.  Any moisture present in this gas is<br><br>
removed by a dryer.  The dried gas forms recycle stream 50, which is sent to cryogenic rectification unit 126.<br>
Impure hydrogen 48 from plant 126 is passed to compressor 134 and resulting compressed stream 56 is    combined with recycle stream 50 containing about 60 to 90 mole percent hydrogen and at about 250 psia from plant 129 to form the aforesaid recycle stream 58 into cryogenic rectification plant 126.     Product  ammonia  is recovered from plant 129 in stream 52 and steam, which<br>
   is produced as a by-product from the ammonia<br>
production, is removed from plant 129 in stream 54 which may be recovered in whole or in part.<br>
Residual nitrogen is withdrawn from cryogenic rectification plant 126 in stream 43.  The major<br>
   portion 44 of stream 43 is passed through pressure swing adsorption unit 118 wherein it serves to regenerate adsorbent which has become loaded with carbon dioxide by desorbing the carbon dioxide from the adsorbent into the residual nitrogen stream.  A minor<br>
   portion 45 of stream 43 is passed through dryer 123 wherein it serves to regenerate adsorbent which has become loaded with water by desorbing the water from the adsorbent into the residual nitrogen stream which is then vented as stream 38.  Resulting waste nitrogen<br>
   stream 31 from unit 118 may be vented or, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, may be passed into catalytic oxidation reactor 136 wherein oxygen from stream 33 reacts with any remaining carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide before the residual nitrogen stream is<br>
   vented as stream 35.<br>
It is an important aspect of this invention that the nitrogen which is used to regenerate the carbon dioxide removal system come from a cryogenic nitrogen-<br><br>
hydrogen separation and not from an air separation plant.  Nitrogen from an air separation plant would be required at higher purity than that of stream 43; otherwise the nitrogen from the air separation plant<br>
   could potentially introduce oxygen into the carbon dioxide removal system and thus ultimately into the fortified blast furnace gas from which the hydrogen for the ammonia production is taken.  Such a presence of oxygen could prove hazardous, and the invention which<br>
   uses two separate cryogenic rectification plants obviates any such potential hazard.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein the carbon dioxide removal system is an absorbent system such as a hot potassium carbonate<br>
   system rather than a pressure swing adsorption system. The numerals in Figure 2 are the same as those in Figure 1 for the common elements and these common elements will not again be described in detail.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, blast furnace gas<br>
  stream 30 is passed from water gas shift reaction section 114 to acid gas removal system 117 which comprises an absorber and stripper using hot potassium carbonate solution as a solvent.  The solvent removes carbon dioxide from gas mixture 30 in an absorber<br>
   tower.  The solvent is regenerated in the stripper<br>
tower by using steam and residual nitrogen from stream 4 4 and the resulting mixture of carbon dioxide and residual nitrogen is vented as stream 34.  Fortified blast furnace gas in stream 32 which may contain about<br>
   500 ppm of carbon dioxide is passed into methanation<br>
section 120 wherein the gas is preheated and then added to a methanator.  Within the methanator all the residual carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide reacts with<br><br>
hydrogen to produce methane.  The gas mixture from the methanation section 120 is passed in stream 36 to dryer 123 which removes water from the gas mixture and the resulting fortified blast furnace gas is withdrawn from   dryer 123 in stream 40.     Dryer 123 is regenerated by residual nitrogen stream 45 and the mixture of nitrogen and water is vented from dryer 123 in stream 38. Residual nitrogen in this embodiment contains hydrogen and methane as impurities.<br>
      Although the invention has been described in<br>
detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that there are other embodiments of the invention within the spirit and the scope of the claims.  For example, the   cryogenic air separation plant need not be dedicated to the production of oxygen for the blast furnace but, rather, could produce oxygen for passage into a pipeline from which the oxygen could be passed not only to the blast furnace but also to other use points.  The<br>
   feed air into the cryogenic air separation plant could be obtained from a blast air blower designed to feed air to the blast furnace.  Argon and/or methane may also be recovered from the cryogenic rectification plant or passed into the ammonia production plant and,<br>
  since they are inerts in the production of ammonia, may be recovered from the ammonia production plant.<br><br>
