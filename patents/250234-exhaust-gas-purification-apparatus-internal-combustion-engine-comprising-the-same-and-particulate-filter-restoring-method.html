				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas purification apparatus which is provided in<br>
an exhaust system for an internal combustion engine, such as representatively a diesel<br>
engine, and has a particulate filter (hereinafter simply referred to as a filter) for collecting<br>
particulate matter (hereinafter referred to as PM) in exhaust gas, and an internal combustion<br>
engine comprising the exhaust gas purification apparatus, and a filter restoring method.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, there is a demand for an improvement in exhaust emission of internal<br>
combustion engines provided in automobiles or the like. Particularly for diesel engines,<br>
removal of PM, such as soot or the like, included in exhaust gas is required in addition to a<br>
reduction in CO, HC and NOx. Therefore, a filter made of a porous material or the like is<br>
provided in an exhaust path of an engine so that PM in exhaust gas is collected by the filter.<br>
Since the filter is made of a porous material or the like as described above, an excessive<br>
increase in the amount of collected PM (hereinafter also referred to as a PM accumulation<br>
amount) results in an increase in flow resistance in the filter, leading to a reduction in the<br>
output power of the engine or the like. Therefore, PM collected by the filter needs to be<br>
removed as appropriate, thereby restoring the filter to revitalize the PM collecting ability.<br>
As a conventional filter restoring method, an operation of supplying backwash air into a<br>
filter or an operation of heating a filter using a heating apparatus is performed in a batch to<br>
remove PM as disclosed in, for example, Patent Document 1 (described below).<br>
Also, a continuous restoration filter which can be continuously used so as to be applicable<br>
to automobile engines or the like, has been proposed in, for example, Patent Document 2.<br>
In Patent Document 2, a plurality of filters are connected in parallel, and some of the filters<br>
2<br><br>
are used to collect PM while the other filters are subjected to a restoration operation,<br>
thereby making it possible to continuously operate the engine.<br>
Since the continuous restoration filter has a larger size, a chemical reaction-type restoration<br>
technique which can have a smaller size also has been proposed (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 3 described below). In this chemical reaction-type restoration technique, NO in<br>
exhaust gas is oxidized into NO2, and PM is removed by oxidation using O (oxygen)<br>
released when the NO2 returns to NO. For example, an oxidation catalyst, such as<br>
platinum or the like, is provided in a filter, and the oxidation action of the oxidation catalyst<br>
is utilized, thereby making it possible to restore the filter during the running of the engine.<br>
However, in the chemical reaction-type restoration technique, the chemical reaction is not<br>
carried out unless the exhaust gas temperature is higher than or equal to a predetermined<br>
restoration operable temperature (e.g., 300Â°C). In other words, when the exhaust gas<br>
temperature continues to be lower than the restoration operable temperature, a large amount<br>
of PM is accumulated in the filter, so that the filter is likely to be clogged. Therefore,<br>
when the accumulation amount of PM reaches a predetermined amount or more, the<br>
exhaust gas temperature needs to be increased to be higher than or equal to the restoration<br>
operable temperature by any means.<br>
In view of this, in an engine comprising an electronically controlled pressure-accumulation<br>
fuel injector (e.g., a so-called common-rail injector), "post injection" that a fuel is injected<br>
again from the injector after a main fuel is injected and an expansion stroke is started, is<br>
performed so that the exhaust gas temperature is increased by combustion of the post<br>
injection fuel (see, for example, Patent Document 4 described below). Alternatively, an air<br>
intake throttling valve is provided for an air intake system, the opening degree of the<br>
throttling valve is reduced to decrease an intake air amount and thereby enrich the air-fuel<br>
ratio, thereby increasing a combustion temperature in a combustion chamber to increase the<br>
exhaust gas temperature (see, for example, Patent Document 5 described below).<br>
3<br><br>
Also, in a filter of the chemical reaction-type restoration technique, the PM accumulation<br>
amount of the filter needs to be correctly detected so as to appropriately obtain timing of<br>
starting the restoration operation.<br>
In view of this, Patent Document 6 and Patent Document 7 described below have been<br>
proposed. In Patent Document 6, a pressure sensor is used to detect a pressure difference<br>
between an upstream side and a downstream side of a filter in an exhaust pipe. When the<br>
pressure difference reaches a predetermined value or more, it is determined that the PM<br>
accumulation amount has become large, so that a filter restoration operation is started. As<br>
the filter restoration operation, Patent Document 6 specifically discloses reducing the<br>
opening degree of an air intake throttling valve provided in an air intake system, reducing<br>
the opening degree of an exhaust throttling valve provided in an exhaust system, increasing<br>
a fuel injection amount, delaying a fuel injection time, and the like.<br>
Also, Patent Document 7 discloses that a PM generation amount and a combustion rate<br>
constant corresponding to a running state of an engine are read out from a map, and the PM<br>
accumulation amount is estimated in accordance with a predetermined calculation<br>
expression.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
As described above, there are some known techniques in which a chemical reaction-type<br>
restoration technique is achieved by providing a means for increasing the exhaust gas<br>
4<br><br>
temperature, however, the conventional techniques have room for an improvement in the<br>
following points.<br>
Firstly, the technique of increasing the exhaust gas temperature by post injection (disclosed<br>
in Patent Document 4 above) is applicable only to electronically controlled fuel injectors<br>
whose fuel injection timing can be arbitrarily set, but not to mechanical fuel injectors.<br>
Therefore, the versatility is low.<br>
In the case of the technique of increasing the exhaust gas temperature by reducing the<br>
intake air amount as disclosed in Patent Document 5 above, for example, when an engine is<br>
in the idle state, the exhaust gas temperature is extremely low, so that it is difficult to<br>
increase the exhaust gas temperature to the restoration operable temperature even if the<br>
opening degree of the air intake throttling valve is reduced within a range which does not<br>
cause the engine to stall from the idle state. This is because, as the opening degree of the<br>
air intake throttling valve is reduced, the air intake pressure decreases, so that a temperature<br>
within the combustion chamber upon completion of a compression stroke decreases, and<br>
therefore, the exhaust gas temperature cannot be increased to the restoration operable<br>
temperature within a range which does not cause misfire.<br>
On the other hand, the PM accumulation amount detection method disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 6 is not considered to secure a sufficient level of reliability. The reason will be<br>
described below. Firstly, pressure sensors are generally poorly heat-resistant, and therefore,<br>
when a pressure sensor is provided in an exhaust system under a high-temperature<br>
environment, the pressure sensor is unlikely to output a correct detection value. Also,<br>
vibration from the engine or the like (an automobile body in the case of an engine for an<br>
automobile) acts on a pressure withdrawal pipe connecting the inside of the exhaust pipe<br>
and the pressure sensor. Therefore, when a crack occurs in the pressure withdrawal pipe<br>
due to the vibration, it is no longer possible to correctly detect the internal pressure of the<br>
exhaust pipe. Particularly, when the pressure withdrawal pipe is connected upstream from<br>
the filter, PM is likely to enter the pipe, leading to clogging. Also, in this case, it is no<br>
longer possible to correctly detect the internal pressure of the exhaust pipe.<br>
5<br><br>
The pressure level of the pressure difference between the upstream side and the downstream<br>
side of the filter is considerably low, and therefore, micro-differential pressure measurement<br>
is required. A high-precision pressure sensor, which is expensive, is required. Thus, the<br>
above-described method is not practical.<br>
In addition, the pressure difference between the upstream side and the downstream side of<br>
the filter varies depending on the running situation of the engine (particularly, the amount of<br>
exhaust gas), even if the PM accumulation amount is the same. Therefore, in order to<br>
know a correct PM accumulation amount, it is necessary to obtain information, such as the<br>
revolution number of the engine, the load of the engine, and the like, and subject the<br>
pressure difference detected by the pressure sensor to correction calculation based on the<br>
information. Therefore, not only means for obtaining the information are required, but<br>
also the calculation operation becomes complicated. Note that, even if the information is<br>
obtained to perform the correction calculation with respect to the pressure difference, the<br>
PM accumulation amount after the correction calculation is not necessarily correct, because<br>
the detected pressure difference is not guaranteed to be correct as described above.<br>
Also, in the PM accumulation amount detection method disclosed in Patent Document 7,<br>
the reliability is not considered to be sufficiently secured. This is because, when a<br>
deterioration in performance occurs in the engine due to any trouble other than normal<br>
deteriorations, a PM emission amount is likely to increase, and in this case, a discrepancy<br>
occurs between a PM accumulation amount estimated in accordance with the calculation<br>
expression and an actual PM accumulation amount. Therefore, it is necessary to employ<br>
another means, such as differential pressure detection as in Patent Document 6 or the like,<br>
to guarantee that the estimated PM accumulation amount is not largely deviated from the<br>
actual PM accumulation amount.<br>
As described above, in conventional PM accumulation amount detection methods, the<br>
reliability is not sufficiently secured, so that the PM accumulation amount of a filter is<br>
likely to be erroneously determined. For example, when it tends to be erroneously<br>
6<br><br>
determined that the PM accumulation amount has reached a predetermined amount (an<br>
amount which requires a filter restoration operation) though the actual PM accumulation<br>
amount is small, the restoration operation is frequently performed, likely leading to an<br>
increase in energy amount required for the restoration operation (e.g., an increase in electric<br>
power consumption when the filter is heated by an electric heater), or an adverse influence<br>
on extension of the life of the filter due to frequent heating of the filter. Conversely, when<br>
it tends to be erroneously determined that the PM accumulation amount has not reached the<br>
predetermined amount though the actual PM accumulation amount has reached the<br>
predetermined amount, the filter is excessively clogged, so that the loss of exhaust pressure<br>
is increased, leading to a reduction in output power or fuel efficiency of the engine.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an exhaust gas purification apparatus which<br>
can perform a restoration operation of a particulate filter in a more appropriate manner and<br>
with more appropriate timing, and an internal combustion engine comprising the exhaust<br>
gas purification apparatus, and a filter restoring method. Specifically, an object of the<br>
present invention is to provide an exhaust gas purification apparatus which can reliably<br>
increase the exhaust gas temperature to improve the reliability of a restoration operation,<br>
independently of the type of a fuel injector, and an internal combustion engine comprising<br>
the exhaust gas purification apparatus, and a filter restoring method, and to provide an<br>
exhaust gas purification apparatus which can correctly recognize a PM accumulation<br>
amount in a filter for collecting PM in exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
internal combustion engine comprising the exhaust gas purification apparatus.<br>
Means for Solving Problem<br>
An exhaust gas purification apparatus according to the present invention comprises a<br>
particulate filter capable of collecting particulate matter in exhaust of an internal<br>
combustion engine and being restored by removing the particulate matter by oxidation<br>
when a temperature of the exhaust reaches a restoration operable temperature, an intake air<br>
amount reducing means provided in an air intake system of the internal combustion engine<br>
and capable of reducing an intake air amount, an exhaust heating means provided in an<br>
7<br><br>
exhaust system of the internal combustion engine and capable of heating exhaust gas, an<br>
accumulation amount detecting means capable of detecting that an accumulation amount of<br>
particulate matter in the particulate filter exceeds a predetermined amount, an exhaust<br>
temperature detecting means capable of detecting the exhaust temperature of the internal<br>
combustion engine, and a restoration operation control means for receiving outputs of the<br>
accumulation amount detecting means and the exhaust temperature detecting means, and<br>
executing any one of an intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount<br>
reducing means and an exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means with<br>
priority or executing both the intake air amount reducing operation and the exhaust gas<br>
heating operation simultaneously, when the accumulation amount of particulate matter in<br>
the particulate filter exceeds the predetermined amount and the exhaust temperature of the<br>
internal combustion engine is lower than the restoration operable temperature.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, particulate matter<br>
emitted along with exhaust gas during running of the internal combustion engine is<br>
collected by the particulate filter. Thereafter, when the running of the internal combustion<br>
engine is continued without the exhaust temperature reaching the restoration operable<br>
temperature, the accumulation amount of particulate matter in the particulate filter increases,<br>
likely leading to clogging of the particulate filter. Therefore, when the accumulation<br>
amount of particulate matter in the particulate filter exceeds a predetermined amount, i.e.,<br>
clogging is likely to occur, and the exhaust temperature of the internal combustion engine is<br>
lower than the restoration operable temperature, i.e., the particulate filter is not<br>
spontaneously restored, the restoration operation control means starts the intake air amount<br>
reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means or the exhaust gas heating<br>
operation by the exhaust heating means. One of these operations may be executed with<br>
priority before the other is executed, or alternatively, both the operations may be<br>
simultaneously executed. Thereby, the exhaust temperature reaches the restoration<br>
operable temperature, and particulate matter in the particulate filter is removed by oxidation,<br>
whereby the particulate filter is restored. Therefore, it is possible to increase the exhaust<br>
temperature to the restoration operable temperature or more without requirement of<br>
conventional post injection. In addition, even when the intake air amount cannot be<br>
8<br><br>
reduced any more, because the engine is in the idle state, the exhaust temperature can be<br>
increased to the restoration operable temperature or more by the exhaust heating means.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is applicable to engines having a mechanical fuel injector,<br>
so that the reliability of the restoration operation can be improved by reliably increasing the<br>
exhaust gas temperature, independently of the type of a fuel injector.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the restoration<br>
operation control means may execute any one of the intake air amount reducing operation<br>
by the intake air amount reducing means and the exhaust gas heating operation by the<br>
exhaust heating means with priority when the accumulation amount of particulate matter in<br>
the particulate filter exceeds the predetermined amount and the exhaust temperature of the<br>
internal combustion engine is lower than the restoration operable temperature, and<br>
thereafter, execute the other operation when the exhaust temperature of the internal<br>
combustion engine has not reached the restoration operable temperature.<br>
For example, assuming that the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air<br>
amount reducing means is performed with priority, when the exhaust temperature reaches<br>
the restoration operable temperature only by the intake air amount reducing operation, the<br>
exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means is no longer required.<br>
Therefore, the loss of energy (e.g., electrical energy) consumed by the exhaust heating<br>
means can be suppressed. Also, when the exhaust temperature is increased to the<br>
restoration operable temperature only by the exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust<br>
heating means (e.g., an electric heater), a long time until the start of restoration may be<br>
required since the rising of the temperature increase is slow. However, if the intake air<br>
amount reducing operation is executed with priority, the exhaust gas temperature can be<br>
increased substantially at the same time of the intake air amount reducing operation.<br>
On the other hand, assuming that the exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating<br>
means is performed with priority, when the exhaust temperature reaches the restoration<br>
operable temperature only by the exhaust gas heating operation, the intake air amount<br>
reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means is no longer required.<br>
9<br><br>
Therefore, it is possible to suppress an increase in the amount of CO and THC generated<br>
along with a reduction in air intake amount. Also, by suppressing the pumping loss of the<br>
engine, a deterioration in fuel efficiency can be suppressed. Also, although there is a limit<br>
of the exhaust gas temperature which can be increased only by the intake air amount<br>
reducing operation (e.g., a temperature increase of only about 50 to 100 degrees), if the<br>
exhaust gas heating operation is performed with priority, the exhaust temperature can be<br>
reliably and significantly increased by the heating operation.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, a predetermined<br>
threshold value may be previously set for an intake air reduction amount by the intake air<br>
amount reducing means, and the intake air amount may not be decreased to be lower than<br>
the threshold value.<br>
As the intake air amount is decreased by the intake air amount reducing operation by the<br>
intake air amount reducing means, a sufficient pressure in a cylinder is not obtained at a<br>
dead point of compression of the internal combustion engine. In this case, a time of<br>
ignition of air-fuel mixture may be significantly delayed, or misfire may occur. Therefore,<br>
a predetermined threshold value is previously set for an intake air amount which can be<br>
reduced, and the intake air amount is prevented from being reduced to be lower than the<br>
threshold value. Thereby, it is possible to avoid a situation where the internal combustion<br>
engine is suspended during a restoration operation of the particulate filter.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
predetermined threshold values may be previously set for an intake air reduction amount by<br>
the intake air amount reducing means.<br>
As the plurality of threshold values, a first threshold value corresponding to an intake air<br>
reduction amount when a CO and THC concentration of exhaust gas reaches a tolerance<br>
limit, and a second threshold value corresponding to an intake air reduction amount when<br>
the internal combustion engine reaches a run limit due to misfire, may be set. When the<br>
intake air reduction amount reaches the first threshold value during the intake air amount<br>
10<br><br>
reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means, the intake air amount reducing<br>
operation by the intake air amount reducing means may be switched to the exhaust gas<br>
heating operation by the exhaust heating means, and thereafter, when the exhaust<br>
temperature of the internal combustion engine still does not reach the restoration operable<br>
temperature, the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing<br>
means may be resumed with the second threshold value being a limit of the intake air<br>
reduction amount.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, when a restoration<br>
operation of the particulate filter is started, the intake air amount reducing operation by the<br>
intake air amount reducing means is initially started, and when the intake air reduction<br>
amount reaches the first threshold value (the intake air reduction amount reaches the first<br>
threshold value without the exhaust temperature reaching the restoration operable<br>
temperature), the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing<br>
means is switched to the exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means.<br>
Thereby, the exhaust gas temperature can be increased while the CO and THC<br>
concentration of exhaust gas is suppressed to a tolerance limit or less. Thereafter, when<br>
the exhaust temperature still does not reach the restoration operable temperature, the intake<br>
air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means is resumed. This<br>
operation is performed with the second threshold value being a limit of the intake air<br>
reduction amount. Therefore, the internal combustion engine is prevented from being<br>
suspended during a restoration operation of the particulate filter.<br>
Also, the plurality of threshold values may be changed, depending on various conditions.<br>
For example, the plurality of threshold values may be changed, depending on a load and a<br>
revolution number of the internal combustion engine, or a cetane number of a fuel used in<br>
the internal combustion engine.<br>
Specifically, when the running state of the internal combustion engine changes or a fuel<br>
having a different cetane number is used in the internal combustion engine, the CO and<br>
THC generation amount or the delay amount of an ignition time of air-fuel mixture changes<br>
11<br><br>
with respect to the intake air reduction amount. In this case, therefore, an intake air<br>
reduction amount when the CO and THC concentration of exhaust gas reaches a tolerance<br>
limit, or an intake air reduction amount when the internal combustion engine reaches the<br>
run limit due to misfire, also takes a different value. Therefore, by changing the threshold<br>
value, depending on the running state of the internal combustion engine or the cetane<br>
number of a fuel, a restoration operation of the particulate filter can be executed while the<br>
CO and THC generation amount is suppressed within a tolerance range.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the exhaust heating<br>
means may comprise an electric heater which uses electric power generated by an output of<br>
the internal combustion engine.<br>
Further, when a difference between a maximum output of the internal combustion engine<br>
and a required output of the internal combustion engine is smaller than an output to be used<br>
by the electric heater, the exhaust gas heating operation by the electric heater may be<br>
limited or forbidden.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, for example, when the<br>
present invention is applied to a vehicle, a required output of the internal combustion engine<br>
can be obtained without a hindrance in the travel performance or the traction performance.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the internal<br>
combustion engine may comprise an EGR device for recirculating exhaust gas to an air<br>
intake side of the internal combustion engine, the EGR device having an EGR path capable<br>
of causing an exhaust side and the air intake side of the internal combustion engine to be in<br>
communication with each other and an EGR valve capable of changing a path area of the<br>
EGR path. During the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount<br>
reducing means, as the intake air reduction amount is increased, the opening degree of the<br>
EGR valve may be reduced.<br>
12<br><br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, even when a pressure<br>
at the air intake side is reduced by the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air<br>
amount reducing means during restoration of the particulate filter, the opening degree of the<br>
EGR valve is reduced, depending on the reduction of the pressure, thereby making it<br>
possible to maintain a constant exhaust recirculation rate. As a result, the combustion state<br>
of air-fuel mixture can be satisfactorily maintained.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, a running state of<br>
the internal combustion engine may be monitored, and when a change amount of the<br>
running state exceeds a predetermined amount, the EGR valve may be completely closed.<br>
This is because, when the opening degree of the EGR valve is changed during restoration of<br>
the particulate filter, depending on the intake air reduction amount by the intake air amount<br>
reducing means, the EGR recirculation amount is slightly delayed with respect to the intake<br>
air amount reducing operation. In other words, when the running state of the internal<br>
combustion engine, such as the revolution number of the engine or the engine torque,<br>
significantly changes, the operation of changing the opening degree of the EGR valve may<br>
have an adverse influence on the combustion state of air-fuel mixture. Therefore, when a<br>
change amount of the running state of the internal combustion engine exceeds a<br>
predetermined amount, the EGR valve is completely closed, thereby making it possible to<br>
avoid faulty combustion.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the internal<br>
combustion engine may comprise a turbocharger for compressing intake air using fluid<br>
energy of exhaust gas. As the plurality of threshold values, a first threshold value<br>
corresponding to an intake air reduction amount when a CO and THC concentration of<br>
exhaust gas reaches a tolerance limit, and a second threshold value corresponding to an<br>
intake air reduction amount when surging of the turbocharger occurs, may be set. When<br>
the intake air reduction amount reaches the first threshold value during the intake air<br>
amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means, the intake air amount<br>
reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means may be switched to the exhaust<br>
13<br><br>
gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means, and thereafter, when the exhaust<br>
temperature of the internal combustion engine still does not reach the restoration operable<br>
temperature, the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing<br>
means may be resumed with the second threshold value being a limit of the intake air<br>
reduction amount.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, in the internal<br>
combustion engine comprising the turbocharger, surging of the turbocharger is prevented<br>
from occurring during a restoration operation of the particulate filter, thereby making it<br>
possible to perform the restoration operation of the particulate filter while the internal<br>
combustion engine is stably run.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the internal<br>
combustion engine may comprise a turbocharger for compressing intake air using fluid<br>
energy of exhaust gas, and a waste gate valve for performing an open operation so as to<br>
cause exhaust gas to bypass the turbocharger or an air intake bypass valve for performing<br>
an open operation so as to cause intake air to bypass the turbocharger. As the plurality of<br>
threshold values, a first threshold value corresponding to an intake air reduction amount<br>
when a CO and THC concentration of exhaust gas reaches a tolerance limit, a second<br>
threshold value corresponding to an intake air reduction amount when surging of the<br>
turbocharger occurs while the waste gate valve or the air intake bypass valve is completely<br>
closed, and a third threshold value corresponding to an intake air reduction amount when<br>
the internal combustion engine reaches a run limit due to misfire while the waste gate valve<br>
or the air intake bypass valve is opened, may be set. When the intake air reduction amount<br>
reaches the first threshold value during the intake air amount reducing operation by the<br>
intake air amount reducing means, the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake<br>
air amount reducing means may be switched to the exhaust gas heating operation by the<br>
exhaust heating means, and thereafter, when the exhaust temperature of the internal<br>
combustion engine still does not reach the restoration operable temperature, the intake air<br>
amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means may be resumed while<br>
the waste gate valve or the air intake bypass valve is completely closed, and when the<br>
14<br><br>
intake air reduction amount reaches the second threshold value, the intake air amount<br>
reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means may be continued with the<br>
third threshold value being a limit of the intake air reduction amount while the waste gate<br>
valve or the air intake bypass valve is opened.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, even when surging of<br>
the turbocharger occurs, the intake air amount can be reduced to increase the exhaust<br>
temperature to the restoration operable temperature while the waste gate valve or the air<br>
intake bypass valve is opened to remove turbocharging and thereby eliminate surging.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the accumulation<br>
amount detecting means may be capable of detecting that the accumulation amount of<br>
particulate matter exceeds the predetermined amount, by obtaining a difference between a<br>
state of the particulate filter based on a load of the internal combustion engine and a<br>
revolution number of the internal combustion engine when the particulate filter is in a<br>
normal state, and a state of the particulate filter based on a load of the internal combustion<br>
engine and a revolution number of the internal combustion engine when the particulate<br>
filter is in a current state.<br>
As used herein, the normal state of the particulate filter refers to, for example, a state in<br>
which PM is not accumulated in the particulate filter (the particulate filter is brand-new).<br>
Specifically, by obtaining a difference between the normal state of the particulate filter, and<br>
the current state of the particulate filter based on a load of the internal combustion engine<br>
and a revolution number of the internal combustion engine the current accumulation<br>
amount of particulate matter in the particulate filter can be estimated, thereby making it<br>
possible to determine whether or not the particulate matter accumulation amount has<br>
exceeded a predetermined amount. For example, this determination can be achieved by<br>
detection and comparison of a pressure immediately upstream from the particulate filter.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the accumulation<br>
amount detecting means may estimate the accumulation amount of particulate matter based<br>
15<br><br>
on a pressure upstream from the particulate filter, estimate an internal temperature of the<br>
particulate filter based on the exhaust temperature, and correct the accumulation amount<br>
using a correction amount determined based on the particulate filter internal temperature<br>
and the particulate filter upstream pressure.<br>
The particulate filter upstream pressure increases as the particulate filter internal<br>
temperature increases. Therefore, when the particulate matter accumulation amount is<br>
estimated based on the particulate filter upstream pressure, not only this pressure but also<br>
the particulate filter internal temperature need to be taken into consideration. Also, when<br>
the exhaust temperature is increasing, the actual increase rate of the particulate filter<br>
internal temperature is delayed by a value corresponding to the heat capacity of the<br>
particulate filter from the increase rate of the exhaust temperature. Therefore, in view of<br>
these points, the particulate filter internal temperature is estimated based on the exhaust<br>
temperature, and the accumulation amount is corrected using a correction amount<br>
determined based on the particulate filter internal temperature and the particulate filter<br>
upstream pressure. Thereby, the particulate matter accumulation amount can be more<br>
correctly estimated.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the accumulation<br>
amount detecting means may be a pressure sensor for detecting a pressure upstream from<br>
the particulate filter. The restoration operation control means, when the particulate filter<br>
upstream pressure reaches a restoration starting pressure, may start a restoration operation,<br>
integrate a fuel injection amount of the internal combustion engine since the particulate<br>
filter in a brand-new state is attached, and update the restoration starting pressure with a<br>
gradually increasing value, depending on the integration value.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, even if particulate<br>
matter which cannot be removed by a restoration operation is accumulated in the particulate<br>
filter, so that a pressure immediately upstream from the particulate filter becomes higher<br>
than that when the particulate filter is brand-new even when a restoration operation is<br>
completed, restoration operations can be executed in constant intervals without an influence<br>
16<br><br>
of the particulate matter. In addition, it is possible to avoid a situation where the<br>
restoration operation cannot be ended.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the restoration<br>
operation control means may update a target restoration temperature with a higher<br>
temperature when the particulate filter upstream pressure has exceeded a predetermined<br>
pressure upon completion of a restoration operation of the particulate filter.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, particulate matter<br>
which remains in an outer circumferential portion of the particulate filter which is<br>
particularly likely to have a low temperature can be effectively removed, thereby making it<br>
possible to execute restoration operations in constant intervals without an increase in<br>
frequency of the restoration operation.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the accumulation<br>
amount detecting means may be a pressure sensor for detecting a pressure upstream from<br>
the particulate filter. The restoration operation control means, when the particulate filter<br>
upstream pressure reaches a restoration ending pressure, may end a restoration operation,<br>
integrate a fuel injection amount of the internal combustion engine since the particulate<br>
filter in a brand-new state is attached, and update the restoration ending pressure with a<br>
gradually increasing value, depending on the integration value.<br>
If a restoration operation is ended when a predetermined time has passed since the start of<br>
the restoration operation, the restoration operation may be continued, though restoration has<br>
been sufficiently done, so that a useless restoration operation may be performed, or the<br>
restoration operation may be ended, though restoration has not yet been completed. In<br>
contrast to this, according to the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, the<br>
restoration ending pressure is updated, taking into consideration that particulate matter<br>
which cannot be removed by a restoration operation is accumulated in the particulate filter.<br>
Therefore, the situation where a useless restoration operation is performed and the situation<br>
where the restoration operation is ended, though restoration has not yet been completed, can<br>
17<br><br>
be avoided, thereby making it possible to improve the reliability of the restoration<br>
operation.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the restoration<br>
operation control means may update the target restoration temperature with a lower<br>
temperature when the particulate filter upstream pressure sharply decreases during a<br>
restoration operation of the particulate filter.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, it is possible to avoid a<br>
situation where a temperature at which a restoration operation is executed is maintained<br>
high, so that heat is significantly generated in the particulate filter, leading to an abnormal<br>
restoration which damages the particulate filter.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the restoration<br>
operation control means may suspend a restoration operation of the particulate filter when<br>
the particulate filter upstream pressure sharply decreases during the restoration operation.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, it is possible to<br>
reliably avoid damage of the particulate filter.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the exhaust system<br>
of the internal combustion engine may comprise an exhaust throttling means capable of<br>
closing an exhaust pipe. The restoration operation control means, when suspending the<br>
internal combustion engine, may interrupt intake air using the intake air amount reducing<br>
means, and close the exhaust pipe.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the exhaust system<br>
of the internal combustion engine may comprise an exhaust throttling means capable of<br>
closing an exhaust pipe. The restoration operation control means, when suspending the<br>
internal combustion engine, may interrupt intake air using the intake air amount reducing<br>
means, close the exhaust pipe, and execute a fuel injection operation.<br>
18<br><br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, air (oxygen) can be<br>
prevented from being introduced from the intake system and the exhaust system to the DPF<br>
33, thereby making it possible to avoid a situation where a restoration reaction of the<br>
particulate filter proceeds, leading to melting damage. In addition, by executing a fuel<br>
injection operation when the internal combustion engine is suspended, oxygen remaining in<br>
a cylinder is subjected to combustion, thereby making it possible to reliably avoid the<br>
progress of the restoration reaction of the particulate filter.<br>
Also, an internal combustion engine according to the present invention is an internal<br>
combustion engine comprising any one of the exhaust gas purification apparatuses<br>
described above, in which, when the accumulation amount of particulate matter in the<br>
particulate filter exceeds the predetermined amount, and the exhaust temperature of the<br>
internal combustion engine is lower than the restoration operable temperature, any one of<br>
the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means and the<br>
exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means is executed with priority or<br>
both of the intake air amount reducing operation and the exhaust gas heating operation are<br>
executed simultaneously, thereby restoring the particulate filter.<br>
Also, a particulate filter restoring method according to the present invention is a particulate<br>
filter restoring method performed by any one of the exhaust gas purification apparatuses<br>
described above, in which, when the accumulation amount of particulate matter in the<br>
particulate filter exceeds the predetermined amount, and the exhaust temperature of the<br>
internal combustion engine is lower than the restoration operable temperature, any one of<br>
the intake air amount reducing operation by the intake air amount reducing means and the<br>
exhaust gas heating operation by the exhaust heating means is executed with priority or<br>
both of the intake air amount reducing operation and the exhaust gas heating operation are<br>
executed simultaneously, thereby restoring the particulate filter.<br>
Alternatively, an exhaust gas purification apparatus according to the present invention<br>
comprises a particulate filter for collecting particulate matter in exhaust gas of an internal<br>
19<br><br>
combustion engine by passing the exhaust gas from a primary side to a secondary side, the<br>
entirety or at least a portion of a surface of the primary side of the particulate filter being<br>
made of a nonconductive material, an electrical resistance detecting means for detecting an<br>
electrical resistance between at least two points of the portion made of the nonconductive<br>
material of the particulate filter, and an accumulation amount estimating means for<br>
receiving an output from the electrical resistance detecting means and estimating an<br>
accumulation amount of particulate matter in the particulate filter.<br>
PM contained in exhaust gas emitted out from an internal combustion engine includes soot<br>
made of carbon (C) as a major component, unburned fuel oil and lubricating oil, and the<br>
like, and has "conductivity". In the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, a<br>
filter made of a nonconductive material, such as a ceramic material (e.g., SiC, etc.) or the<br>
like, is employed. A change in electrical resistance due to accumulation of PM between,<br>
for example, two points in the nonconductive material portion is detected by the electrical<br>
resistance detecting means.<br>
While the internal combustion engine is run, the filter collects PM in exhaust gas of the<br>
internal combustion engine by causing the exhaust gas to pass from the primary side to the<br>
secondary side. In other words, conductive PM is accumulated on a surface of the primary<br>
side of the filter. When the accumulation amount of PM becomes large, the surface<br>
between the two points whose electrical resistance is to be detected becomes conductive.<br>
As the PM accumulation amount further increases, the accumulation thickness increases<br>
and the electrical resistance value gradually decreases. Therefore, a change in the electrical<br>
resistance value is detected by the electrical resistance detecting means, and the detection<br>
signal is received by the accumulation amount estimating means, thereby making it possible<br>
to recognize that the PM accumulation amount has become large.<br>
As described above, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, the<br>
conductivity of PM is effectively utilized, thereby making it possible to recognize the PM<br>
accumulation amount. Therefore, a high level of reliability of the PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting operation can be obtained as compared to the conventional art in which a<br>
20<br><br>
pressure difference between an upstream side and a downstream side of the filter is detected<br>
by a pressure sensor, or a PM generation amount corresponding to a running state of the<br>
internal combustion engine or the like is read from a map. Also, a relatively simple<br>
configuration in which wires (conductive wires) for detecting an electrical resistance are<br>
connected to a filter surface can be employed, resulting in a high level of practicability.<br>
Also, according to the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, a running state<br>
(a revolution number and a load) of the internal combustion engine does not need to be<br>
detected. Therefore, the PM accumulation amount can be correctly recognized in internal<br>
combustion engines employing a mechanical fuel injection system which does not comprise<br>
means for detecting the revolution number and the load. Also, there is no erroneous<br>
operation due to a failure of a sensor for detecting the revolution number or the load,<br>
thereby making it possible to obtain a high level of reliability.<br>
Although the case where the whole filter is made of a nonconductive material has been<br>
described above, substantially the whole filter may be made of a conductive material, while<br>
only a portion of the surface of the primary side may be made of a nonconductive material,<br>
and an electrical resistance between at least two points of the nonconductive material<br>
portion may be detected by the electrical resistance detecting means. For example, a<br>
nonconductive material may be applied to two portions separated by a predetermined<br>
distance on a surface of a primary side of a metal filter, and an electrical wire is connected<br>
to the two portions so that an electrical resistance between the two points may be detected.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, at least two<br>
electrical resistance detecting means may be provided.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, even if disconnection<br>
occurs in an electrical wire of one electrical resistance detecting means, the other electrical<br>
resistance detecting means can detect an electrical resistance on the filter, thereby making it<br>
possible to secure the reliability of the PM accumulation amount detecting operation. Also,<br>
when the disconnection occurs in one electrical resistance detecting means, an electrical<br>
21<br><br>
resistance value detected by the electrical resistance detecting means continues to be infinite.<br>
By recognizing this, it can be readily recognized that disconnection occurs in the electrical<br>
resistance detecting means.<br>
Further, assuming that at least two electrical resistance detecting means are provided as in<br>
the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, when electrical resistance values<br>
detected by the plurality of electrical resistance detecting means are all finite and different<br>
from each other, a lowest detected electrical resistance value is preferably recognized as a<br>
true electrical resistance value. This is to address nonuniform accumulation (biased<br>
accumulation) of PM with respect to the filter. Of portions where an electrical resistance is<br>
detected, a portion having a largest PM accumulation amount (a portion having a low<br>
electrical resistance) is used as a reference to determine timing of starting a filter restoration<br>
operation. If a detected electrical resistance value which is higher than an electrical<br>
resistance value detected by another electrical resistance detecting means as a true electrical<br>
resistance value, PM may be excessively accumulated at the other portion (a portion where<br>
a low electrical resistance value is detected), so that a temperature may excessively increase<br>
at the portion during a filter restoration operation, likely leading to damage of the filter. To<br>
avoid this situation, as described above, a lowest detected electrical resistance value (an<br>
electrical resistance value at a portion where PM is most accumulated) is recognized as a<br>
true electrical resistance value.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the electrical<br>
resistance detecting means may be adapted to detect electrical resistances between at least<br>
three points of the nonconductive material portion of the particulate filter.<br>
For example, assuming that electrical resistances between three points (here referred to as<br>
points X, Y and Z on the filter) are detected, when no disconnection occurs in electrical<br>
wires connected to the points,<br>
r1 = r2 = r3 = r<br>
22<br><br>
where r1, r2 and r3 represent resistance values between the points (in the absence of biased<br>
accumulation). Electrical resistance values detected between the points are represented by:<br>
R(X, Y) = R(Y, Z) = R(Z, X) = R = (2/3)r<br>
where R(X, Y) represents a resistance value between "point X" and "point Y", R(Y, Z)<br>
represents a resistance value between "point Y" and "point Z", and R(Z, X) represents a<br>
resistance value between "point Z" and "point X".<br>
When disconnection occurs in one electrical wire (disconnection in an electrical wire<br>
connected to "point X"),<br>
R(X, Y) = ï¥<br>
R(Z, X) = ï¥<br>
R(Y,Z) = r.<br>
The electrical resistance value of R(Y, Z) suddenly increases by a factor of 1.5 (1.5 times<br>
higher than when disconnection does not occur). Therefore, according to the exhaust gas<br>
purification apparatus configured above, by recognizing such a sharp increase in the<br>
electrical resistance value, disconnection in an electrical wire can be readily recognized.<br>
Note that, even in such a configuration for detecting electrical resistances between three<br>
points of the nonconductive material portion on the particulate filter, a lowest detected<br>
electrical resistance value is preferably recognized as a true electrical resistance value as<br>
described above.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the electrical<br>
resistance detecting means may be adapted to be capable of measuring a particulate filter<br>
surface temperature of a point where an electrical resistance is to be measured (a point to<br>
which the electrical wire is connected).<br>
23<br><br>
Specifically, for example, an electrical wire (the above-described electrical resistance<br>
measuring wire) and an electrical wire made of a material different from that of the<br>
above-described electrical resistance measuring wire, are connected to the point subjected<br>
to measurement of the electrical resistance, and a closed circuit is formed of both the<br>
electrical wires to measure a voltage of the circuit. For example, a function as a<br>
thermocouple is added to an electrical resistance measuring probe.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, the electrical<br>
resistance is measured between an electrical resistance measuring wire of a negative probe<br>
on thermocouple side and another probe. The thermocouple-side probe is used to measure<br>
a temperature at a point whose electrical resistance is to be measured, thereby making it<br>
possible to determine whether or not a restoration operation is normally performed (a<br>
restoration operation is performed at an appropriate temperature). Also, when a plurality<br>
of electrical resistance detecting means are provided and are each provided with a function<br>
as a thermocouple, temperatures of a plurality of portions on the filter can be measured<br>
during a restoration operation, thereby making it possible to recognize the presence or<br>
absence of biased temperature of the filter. When the biased temperature occurs, it can be<br>
determined that biased accumulation of PM occurs (a state which requires maintenance).<br>
In other words, by adding a temperature measuring function to the electrical resistance<br>
detecting means, it can be determined whether or not the maintenance of the filter is<br>
required.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, the accumulation<br>
amount estimating means may perform a correction calculation based on a temperature of<br>
the particulate filter with respect to the electrical resistance detected by the electrical<br>
resistance detecting means, thereby estimating the accumulation amount of particulate<br>
matter. Such a configuration is preferable because the electrical resistance value varies<br>
depending on the filter temperature.<br>
As can be seen from a relationship between filter temperatures and electrical resistance<br>
values in FIG. 6, even when the PM accumulation amount is the same, the higher the filter<br>
24<br><br>
temperature, the lower the electrical resistance value. In view of this, for example, a<br>
correction calculation is performed using the following correction expression, thereby<br>
making it possible to estimate the particulate matter accumulation amount with high<br>
accuracy.<br>
R = aT2 + bT + c<br>
R: electrical resistance value, T: filter temperature, a, b, c: coefficients<br>
Note that, when the PM accumulation amount is calculated based on the filter temperature<br>
in this manner, a thermocouple integrated with the electrical resistance detecting means as<br>
described above may be used or separate temperature sensors may be used as a means for<br>
measuring the filter temperature.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, when the particulate<br>
matter accumulation amount estimated by the accumulation amount estimating means<br>
exceeds a predetermined restoration starting accumulation amount, a filter restoration<br>
operation may be started, and when the particulate matter accumulation amount estimated<br>
by the accumulation amount estimating means becomes lower than a predetermined<br>
restoration ending accumulation amount, the filter restoration operation may be suspended.<br>
In this case, an electrical resistance value corresponding to the restoration starting<br>
accumulation amount and an electrical resistance value corresponding to the restoration<br>
ending accumulation amount are previously set. Regarding these electrical resistance<br>
values, it is preferable that the latter electrical resistance value be set to be higher, thereby<br>
suppressing so-called hunting that start and suspension of a filter restoration operation are<br>
frequently repeated.<br>
Conventionally, a filter restoration operation during running of an internal combustion<br>
engine is generally performed by monitoring differential pressure detection values of the<br>
pressure sensor, and when the value reaches a predetermined value or more, increasing the<br>
25<br><br>
exhaust temperature by reducing an air intake amount or changing a fuel injection time or<br>
its pattern. The reduction of the air intake amount and the changing of the fuel injection<br>
time or its pattern themselves change a differential pressure between the upstream side and<br>
the downstream side of the filter, so that it is difficult to estimate the correct PM<br>
accumulation amount based on the differential pressure detection value. Also, the fuel<br>
efficiency of the internal combustion engine may be deteriorated. According to the<br>
exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, these drawbacks can be avoided,<br>
thereby making it possible to correctly estimate the PM accumulation amount and improve<br>
the fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, when a change rate<br>
of an electrical resistance value detected by the electrical resistance detecting means during<br>
execution of a filter restoration operation exceeds a predetermined abnormality<br>
determination change rate, the filter restoration operation may be suspended.<br>
When the change rate of the electrical resistance value detected by the electrical resistance<br>
detecting means thus exceeds the predetermined abnormality determination change rate, i.e.,<br>
the change rate of the electrical resistance value on the filter is sharp, "abnormal<br>
restoration" that a portion of the filter locally has an abnormally high temperature may<br>
occur. When the "abnormal restoration" state is continued, melting damage of the filter is<br>
likely to occur. Therefore, the filter restoration operation is ended when the change rate of<br>
the electrical resistance value becomes high. Thereby, the life of the filter can be extended.<br>
Also, the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention may comprise a<br>
pressure sensor for detecting a pressure difference between an upstream side and a<br>
downstream side of the particulate filter, and a maintenance determining means for<br>
receiving an output from the pressure sensor and an output from the electrical resistance<br>
detecting means, and based on the outputs, determining whether or not the particulate filter<br>
requires maintenance.<br>
26<br><br>
In general, examples of matter accumulated on the particulate filter include matter which<br>
cannot be removed (e.g., ash due to attachment of lubricating oil, engine abrasion powder,<br>
etc.) in addition to the above-described PM which can be removed by a restoration<br>
operation. When an accumulation state is monitored only by detecting a differential<br>
pressure using a pressure sensor, it is difficult to determine whether an increase in the<br>
differential pressure is caused by the above-described PM or by engine abrasion powder or<br>
the like. To achieve this, it is necessary to determine the necessity of maintenance, such as<br>
purification of the filter or the like, based on the total run time of the engine. In contrast to<br>
this, according to the exhaust gas purification apparatus configured above, for example,<br>
when a differential pressure detected by the pressure sensor is relatively high and an<br>
electrical resistance value on the filter detected by the electrical resistance detecting means<br>
is relatively low, it can be determined that the accumulation amount of PM which can be<br>
removed by a restoration operation is large. On the other hand, when a differential<br>
pressure detected by the pressure sensor is relatively high and an electrical resistance value<br>
detected on the filter by the electrical resistance detecting means is relatively high, it can be<br>
determined that the accumulation amount of PM which cannot be removed by a restoration<br>
operation is large. Therefore, it is easy to determine whether the filter can be cleaned by<br>
execution of a restoration operation or the maintenance of the particulate filter is required.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, when the particulate<br>
matter accumulation amount estimated by the accumulation amount estimating means<br>
exceeds the predetermined restoration starting accumulation amount, a filter restoration<br>
operation may be started, and a filter restoration operating condition may be determined<br>
based on the measured particulate filter surface temperature.<br>
According to the thus-configured exhaust gas purification apparatus, the filter surface<br>
temperature is measured at the same time when a PM accumulation amount is detected. A<br>
restoration operation is started after determining filter restoration operation conditions (e.g.,<br>
a restoration operation continuation time, a reduction in air intake amount, a change amount<br>
in the fuel injection time, etc.) based on a difference between the filter surface temperature<br>
upon the start of a restoration operation and the restoration target temperature. Thereby, a<br>
27<br><br>
filter restoration operation can be executed under appropriate conditions, thereby making it<br>
possible to minimize and suppress a deterioration in fuel efficiency due to the restoration<br>
operation.<br>
Also, in the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention, when a filter<br>
temperature upon activation of the internal combustion engine is lower than or equal to a<br>
predetermined temperature, a filter restoration operation may be forcedly forbidden.<br>
For example, in a particulate filter for which a catalytic reaction is used, assuming that the<br>
filter temperature is lower than or equal to a predetermined temperature (cold state) upon<br>
the start of the internal combustion engine, if a filter restoration operation, such as reduction<br>
of the air intake amount, changing of the fuel injection time or its pattern, or the like, is<br>
executed, CO or THC does not react with a catalyst due to incomplete combustion of<br>
air-fuel mixture, so that CO or THC is emitted, as it is, to the atmosphere, resulting in<br>
irritating odor. Therefore, the filter restoration operation is forcedly forbidden during the<br>
cold state so as to suppress incomplete combustion of air-fuel mixture, thereby reducing the<br>
emission amount of CO and THC.<br>
An internal combustion engine comprising any one of the above-described exhaust gas<br>
purification apparatuses is also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the exhaust gas purification apparatus of the present invention and the internal<br>
combustion engine comprising the exhaust gas purification apparatus, a restoration<br>
operation for a particulate filter can be performed in a more appropriate manner and with<br>
more appropriate timing.<br>
It is possible to increase the exhaust temperature to the restoration operable temperature or<br>
more without requirement of conventional post injection. In addition, even when the<br>
intake air amount cannot be reduced any more, because the engine is in the idle state, the<br>
28<br><br>
exhaust temperature can be increased to the restoration operable temperature or more by the<br>
exhaust heating means. As a result, the present invention is applicable to engines having a<br>
mechanical fuel injector, so that the versatility of the particulate filter is increased, and in<br>
addition, the exhaust gas temperature can be reliably increased, resulting in an improvement<br>
in the reliability of the restoration operation.<br>
The reliability of the PM accumulation amount detecting operation can be improved as<br>
compared to the conventional art in which a pressure difference between an upstream side<br>
and a downstream side of the filter is detected by a pressure sensor, or a PM generation<br>
amount or the like corresponding to a running state of the internal combustion engine is<br>
read out and calculated from a map. In addition, the present invention provides a relatively<br>
simple configuration in which wires (conductive wires) for detecting an electrical resistance<br>
are connected to the filter, thereby making it possible to improve the practicability.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. In the embodiments, the present invention is applied to an<br>
exhaust gas purification apparatus comprising a diesel particulate filter (hereinafter referred<br>
to a DPF) which is provided in a diesel engine for a tractor. Note that the present invention<br>
is not limited to diesel engines, and may be applied to gas engines, gasoline engines, and<br>
the like. The present invention may also be applied to engines provided in automobiles,<br>
electric generators, and the like.<br>
Before describing the embodiments of the present invention, a basic configuration of an<br>
engine according to the embodiments will be roughly described.<br>
- Configuration of engine and DPF restoration control system -<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram roughly showing a configuration of an engine and a control<br>
system for restoring a DPF according to an embodiment. As shown in FIG. 1, in the<br>
engine, an air intake system 2 is connected to one side of an engine main body 1 (a lower<br>
portion of FIG. 1), while an exhaust system 3 is connected to the other side (an upper<br>
portion of FIG. 1).<br>
The air intake system 2 comprises an air intake pipe 21, an air intake manifold 22, and a<br>
fuel pump 23. Air is introduced via the air intake pipe 21 and the air intake manifold 22 to<br>
a cylinder (a cylinder during an intake stroke) of the engine main body 1, and thereafter,<br>
upon completion of a compression stroke of the cylinder, a fuel is pneumatically transmitted<br>
from the fuel pump 23 to a combustion chamber (antechamber), thereby carrying out an<br>
expansion stroke along with autoignition combustion of air-fuel mixture in the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
The air intake system 2 is characterized in that the air intake pipe 21 is provided with an air<br>
intake throttling device 24. Specifically, the air intake throttling device 24 comprises a<br>
35<br><br>
butterfly valve and an actuator which rotates the butterfly valve to change a flow path area<br>
of the air intake pipe 21 (both not shown). Note that this valve mechanism is not limited to<br>
butterfly valves, and shutter valves and the like are applicable.<br>
On the other hand, the exhaust system 3 comprises an exhaust manifold 31 and an exhaust<br>
pipe 32. In an exhaust stroke after the expansion stroke, exhaust gas is emitted from the<br>
cylinder to the exhaust manifold 31, and thereafter, is emitted via the exhaust pipe 32 to the<br>
atmosphere. The exhaust pipe 32 is provided with a DPF 33 for collecting PM included in<br>
the exhaust gas. The DPF 33 comprises a casing and a filter main body housed in the<br>
casing. The filter main body has a honeycomb structure which has a number of cells<br>
separated with partition walls having filtering ability. Specifically, for example, one of end<br>
portions is closed in some cells, while the other end is closed in the other cells. When<br>
exhaust gas is transmitted between cells, PM is collected. The filter main body is made of<br>
a material having heat resistance, oxidation resistance, and thermal shock resistance.<br>
Applicable examples of such a material include porous cordierite ceramics, silicon carbide,<br>
alumina, mullite, silicon nitride, sintered alloy, and the like. The filter main body also has<br>
an oxidation catalyst, such as platinum or the like. In the DPF 33, when an exhaust gas<br>
temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature (e.g., 300Â°C; hereinafter referred to as a<br>
"restoration operable temperature"), the chemical reaction is carried out, so that PM is<br>
removed by oxidation, whereby the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
The exhaust system 3 is characterized in that an exhaust temperature increasing device<br>
(exhaust heating means) 34 is provided upstream from the DPF 33 of the exhaust pipe 32.<br>
The exhaust temperature increasing device 34, which is comprised of an electric heater,<br>
receives electric power from an electric generator (alternator; not shown) and generates heat,<br>
thereby making it possible to heat exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust pipe 32.<br>
Specifically, exhaust gas may be indirectly heated by heating the exhaust pipe 32, or may be<br>
directly heated by providing a heater line in the exhaust pipe 32. Note that a flame burner<br>
may be applicable as the exhaust temperature increasing device 34.<br>
36<br><br>
Further, a PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 for detecting an amount of PM<br>
accumulated in the DPF 33 is attached to the DPF 33. An exhaust temperature detecting<br>
sensor (exhaust temperature detecting means) 37 for detecting the exhaust gas temperature<br>
is attached to the exhaust temperature increasing device 34. The exhaust temperature<br>
detecting sensor 37 may be provided in the exhaust temperature increasing device 34, or<br>
may be attached to the exhaust pipe 32 immediately upstream from the DPF 33.<br>
An operation of detecting the PM accumulation amount is performed by the PM<br>
accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 as follows. For example, the PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensor 36 is comprised of a pressure sensor, and the PM accumulation<br>
amount is determined by detecting a deviation of a current pressure from a pressure<br>
immediately upstream from the DPF 33 when no PM is accumulated in the DPF 33 (when<br>
the DPF 33 is brand-new). Hereinafter, a specific description will be given. FIG. 2(a)<br>
shows a relationship between the numbers of revolutions of the engine and pressures<br>
immediately upstream from the DPF 33 when the engine torque is at predetermined values<br>
(specific values). In FIG. 2(a), line A indicates characteristics when no PM is accumulated<br>
in the DPF 33. The PM accumulation amount can be detected by detecting a deviation of<br>
the current pressure from line A. For example, in FIG. 2(a), line B indicates characteristics<br>
when PM is accumulated in an amount corresponding to 20% of the capacity of the DPF 33,<br>
and line C indicates characteristics when PM is accumulated in an amount corresponding to<br>
30%. In other words, the current PM accumulation amount can be detected by detecting<br>
the revolution number of the engine and the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF<br>
33 under a condition that the engine torque is constant. Specifically, a controller<br>
(restoration operation control means) 5 receives a pressure signal from the PM<br>
accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 and an engine revolution number signal from an<br>
unshown engine revolution number sensor, and calculates the PM accumulation amount.<br>
Note that the PM accumulation amount may be detected only by the PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensor 36.<br>
Alternatively, the PM accumulation amount can be detected based on a relationship<br>
between a load of the engine and the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33.<br>
37<br><br>
FIG. 2(b) shows a relationship between engine loads and pressures immediately upstream<br>
from the DPF 33 when the revolution number of the engine is at predetermined values<br>
(specific values). In FIG. 2(b), line A indicates characteristics when no PM is accumulated<br>
in the DPF 33. The PM accumulation amount can be detected by detecting a deviation of<br>
the current pressure from line A. For example, in FIG. 2(b), line B indicates characteristics<br>
when PM is accumulated in an amount corresponding to 20% of the capacity of the DPF 33,<br>
and line C indicates characteristics when PM is accumulated in an amount corresponding to<br>
30%. In other words, the current PM accumulation amount can be detected by detecting<br>
the engine load and the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 under a condition<br>
that the revolution number of the engine is constant.<br>
The engine is provided with a restoration controller 5 for controlling a restoration operation<br>
of the DPF 33. The controller 5 receives a PM accumulation amount detection signal (e.g.,<br>
the pressure signal) transmitted from the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 and<br>
an exhaust temperature detection signal transmitted from the exhaust temperature detecting<br>
sensor 37. The controller 5 also transmits control signals to the air intake throttling device<br>
24 and the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 in accordance with the received PM<br>
accumulation amount detection signal and exhaust temperature detection signal. The<br>
actuator of the air intake throttling device 24 is activated in accordance with an air intake<br>
throttling control signal transmitted to the air intake throttling device 24, so that the<br>
butterfly valve is rotated so as to obtain an opening degree corresponding to the air intake<br>
throttling control signal. Also, the electric heater is ON/OFF controlled in accordance with<br>
an exhaust temperature increase control signal transmitted to the exhaust temperature<br>
increasing device 34, so that an operation of heating exhaust gas by the electric heater is<br>
controlled.<br>
The configuration of the engine of the embodiments has been heretofore outlined. Next,<br>
each embodiment will be described.<br>
38<br><br>
(First embodiment)<br>
In this embodiment, the air intake throttling device 24 and the exhaust temperature<br>
increasing device 34 are controlled, depending the PM accumulation amount and the<br>
exhaust gas temperature in the DPF 33. Specifically, when the controller 5 receives the<br>
PM accumulation amount detection signal from the PM accumulation amount detecting<br>
sensor 36 and determines that the PM accumulation amount in the DPF 33 has exceeded a<br>
predetermined amount, and the controller 5 receives the exhaust temperature detection<br>
signal from the exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37 and determines that the exhaust gas<br>
temperature has not reached the restoration operable temperature (hereinafter, the case<br>
where these two conditions are satisfied is referred to as "the case where the exhaust<br>
temperature increase control start condition is satisfied"), one or both of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24 and the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 are activated to<br>
increase the exhaust gas temperature to the restoration operable temperature, thereby<br>
performing the restoration operation of the DPF 33 while continuing running the engine<br>
main body 1. Hereinafter, a plurality of specific operations will be described.<br>
- Air intake throttling priority operation -<br>
Firstly, an operation in which priority is given to an air intake throttling operation of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24 will be described. When the exhaust temperature increase<br>
control start condition is satisfied, the controller 5 initially transmits the air intake throttling<br>
control signal to the air intake throttling device 24. Thereby, the actuator of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24 is activated so that the butterfly valve is rotated to obtain an opening<br>
degree corresponding to the air intake throttling control signal, thereby reducing the flow<br>
path area of the air intake pipe 21. As a result, the intake air amount is reduced, so that the<br>
air-fuel ratio is enriched. Thereby, the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber<br>
increases, resulting in an increase in the exhaust gas temperature. When the exhaust gas<br>
temperature thereby reaches the restoration operable temperature, the DPF 33 is restored<br>
without activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34.<br>
39<br><br>
Even if a predetermined has passed since the execution of the restoration operation in which<br>
the air intake throttling device 24 is activated, the exhaust gas temperature which is detected<br>
by the exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37 may not reach the restoration operable<br>
temperature. In this case, the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 is activated.<br>
Specifically, the controller 5 transmits the exhaust temperature increase control signal to the<br>
exhaust temperature increasing device 34. Thereby, the electric heater is turned ON, so<br>
that the operation of heating exhaust gas by the electric heater is started. As a result, the<br>
exhaust gas temperature is further increased. Thus, by the air intake throttling operation of<br>
the air intake throttling device 24 and the heating operation of the exhaust temperature<br>
increasing device 34 (electric heater), the exhaust gas temperature is caused to reach the<br>
restoration operable temperature, so that the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram showing changes over time in the exhaust gas temperature when the air<br>
intake throttling operation is performed by the air intake throttling device 24 before the<br>
heating operation is performed by the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 in the air<br>
intake throttling priority operation. As can be seen from FIG. 3, the exhaust gas<br>
temperature temporarily increases immediately after the air intake throttling operation is<br>
started by the air intake throttling device 24 (the starting point is indicated by point A), and<br>
thereafter, the exhaust gas temperature reaches a limit of increase which can be attained<br>
only by the air intake throttling operation (temperature increase limit) (point B in FIG. 3).<br>
Thereafter, the heating operation is performed by the exhaust temperature increasing device<br>
34 (the starting point of the heating operation is indicated by point C in FIG. 3), whereby the<br>
exhaust gas temperature is increased again to reach the restoration operable temperature<br>
(target temperature), so that the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
According to the above-described air intake throttling priority operation, when the exhaust<br>
gas temperature reaches the restoration operable temperature by the air intake throttling<br>
operation of the air intake throttling device 24, the exhaust temperature increasing device 34<br>
is not activated. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the loss of energy due to the passage<br>
of electric current through the electric heater. Also, if the exhaust gas temperature is<br>
caused to increase to the restoration operable temperature only due to heating by the<br>
40<br><br>
exhaust temperature increasing device 34, the slow rising of the temperature increase of the<br>
electric heater is likely to elongate a time required until restoration is actually started. In<br>
contrast, according to this air intake throttling priority operation, the air intake throttling<br>
operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is first started, so that the exhaust gas<br>
temperature can be quickly increased.<br>
- Exhaust heating priority operation -<br>
Next, an operation in which priority is given to heating of exhaust performed by the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34 will be described. When the exhaust temperature<br>
increase control start condition is satisfied, the controller 5 initially transmits the exhaust<br>
temperature increase control signal to the exhaust temperature increasing device 34.<br>
Thereby, the electric heater is turned ON to start an operation of heating exhaust gas. As a<br>
result, the exhaust gas temperature is increased. When the exhaust gas temperature<br>
thereby reaches the restoration operable temperature, the DPF 33 is restored without an air<br>
intake throttling operation being performed by the air intake throttling device 24.<br>
On the other hand, even if a predetermined time has passed since the activation of the<br>
exhaust temperature increasing device 34, the exhaust gas temperature detected by the<br>
exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37 may not reach the restoration operable temperature.<br>
In this case, the air intake throttling device 24 is activated. Specifically, the controller 5<br>
transmits the air intake throttling control signal to the air intake throttling device 24.<br>
Thereby, the actuator of the air intake throttling device 24 is activated so that the butterfly<br>
valve is rotated to obtain an opening degree corresponding to the air intake throttling<br>
control signal, thereby reducing the flow path area of the air intake pipe 21. As a result,<br>
the intake air amount is reduced, so that the air-fuel ratio is enriched. Thereby, the<br>
combustion temperature in the combustion chamber increases, resulting in a further<br>
increase in the exhaust gas temperature. Thus, the exhaust gas temperature is caused to<br>
reach the restoration operable temperature by the heating operation of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34 and the air intake throttling operation of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24, so that the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
41<br><br>
Also, in the exhaust heating priority operation, as in the air intake throttling priority<br>
operation described with reference to FIG. 3, the exhaust gas temperature reaches the<br>
restoration operable temperature via the two steps of increasing the exhaust gas temperature<br>
(an increase in temperature by the heating operation of the exhaust temperature increasing<br>
device 34 and an increase in temperature by the air intake throttling operation of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24), so that the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
According to the exhaust heating priority operation, when the exhaust gas temperature<br>
reaches the restoration operable temperature by the heating operation of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34, the air intake throttling device 24 is not activated.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to suppress an increase in the amount of CO and THC which are<br>
generated due to a reduction in the air intake amount. It is also possible to suppress a<br>
deterioration in fuel efficiency by suppressing the pumping loss of the engine. There is a<br>
limit of increase in the exhaust gas temperature which can be attained only by the air intake<br>
throttling operation (e.g., a temperature increase of only about 50 to 100 degrees). By the<br>
exhaust heating priority operation, the exhaust gas temperature can be reliably and<br>
significantly increased by the heating operation of the electric heater.<br>
- Selection between air intake throttling priority operation and exhaust heating priority<br>
operation -<br>
Any one of the air intake throttling priority operation and the exhaust heating priority<br>
operation may be previously set to be performed in an individual engine. In other words,<br>
an engine is produced so as to perform either the air intake throttling priority operation or<br>
the exhaust heating priority operation. Alternatively, the same engine may selectively<br>
perform the air intake throttling priority operation and the exhaust heating priority operation,<br>
depending on the running situation.<br>
As the select operation, specifically, the controller 5 receives the exhaust temperature<br>
detection signal from the exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37, compares the detected<br>
42<br><br>
exhaust gas temperature with the restoration operable temperature, and executes the air<br>
intake throttling priority operation when the exhaust gas temperature is slightly lower than<br>
the restoration operable temperature (e.g., the difference is less than 100 degrees). In this<br>
case, the exhaust gas temperature can be caused to reach the restoration operable<br>
temperature only by the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24,<br>
i.e., the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 does not need to<br>
be performed.<br>
On the other hand, when the load of the engine sharply increases (e.g., climbing a slope),<br>
the exhaust heating priority operation is executed. This is because, if the air intake amount<br>
is reduced when the engine load sharply increases, the engine is likely to stall, and therefore,<br>
priority is given to the heating operation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34,<br>
thereby securing the air intake amount.<br>
Alternatively, selection between the air intake throttling priority operation and the exhaust<br>
heating priority operation may be performed, depending on the revolution number of the<br>
engine and the exhaust gas temperature. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a map is stored<br>
in the controller 5, which indicates that the exhaust heating priority operation is selected<br>
when the revolution number of the engine and the exhaust gas temperature are both low,<br>
and the air intake throttling priority operation is selected when the revolution number of the<br>
engine and the exhaust gas temperature are both high. The select operation is performed in<br>
accordance with the map.<br>
- Air intake throttling and exhaust heating simultaneously starting operation -<br>
In this operation, when the exhaust temperature increase control start condition is satisfied,<br>
the controller 5 transmits the air intake throttling control signal to the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 and, in addition, the exhaust temperature increase control signal to the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34. Thereby, both an increase in the exhaust gas<br>
temperature by the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24 and<br>
an increase in the exhaust gas temperature by the heating operation of the exhaust<br>
43<br><br>
temperature increasing device 34 can be achieved, so that the exhaust gas temperature<br>
quickly reaches the restoration operable temperature, and therefore, the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
Therefore, a time from when the exhaust temperature increase control start condition is<br>
satisfied to when the restoration of the DPF 33 is completed, can be reduced.<br>
- Air intake throttle limit of air intake throttling device 24 -<br>
As the intake air amount is decreased by the air intake throttling operation of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24, a sufficient pressure is not obtained in the cylinder (a pressure which<br>
enables autoignition of air-fuel mixture with appropriate timing is not obtained) at a dead<br>
point of compression in the engine. In this case, a time of ignition of air-fuel mixture is<br>
significantly delayed, or misfire occurs. Therefore, there is a limit of the air intake throttle<br>
amount of the air intake throttling device 24. Therefore, an upper limit value of a control<br>
width (maximum throttle amount: threshold value) which provides a throttle amount which<br>
does not lead to the limit of the air intake throttle amount, is previously set for the air intake<br>
throttling control signal transmitted from the controller 5 to the air intake throttling device<br>
24. Such a setting of the air intake throttling limit is previously set in all of the air intake<br>
throttling priority operation, the exhaust heating priority operation, and the air intake<br>
throttling and exhaust heating simultaneously starting operation. Note that the threshold<br>
value is specifically defined as an opening degree of the butterfly valve which provides<br>
about 20% of the flow path area of the air intake pipe 21 when the butterfly valve is fully<br>
opened.<br>
FIG. 5 shows changing states of the pressure in the cylinder when the air intake throttle<br>
amount is changed, and air-fuel mixture ignition timings for respective air intake throttle<br>
amounts. As can be seen from FIG. 5, when the air intake throttling operation is not<br>
performed (line A in FIG. 5), the pressure in the cylinder is sufficient at the dead point of<br>
compression, and the air-fuel mixture ignition timing is present in the vicinity of a dead<br>
point of the piston (ignition timing a). In contrast to this, as the air intake throttle amount<br>
is increased, the pressure in the cylinder at the dead point of compression decreases (lines B<br>
and C in FIG. 5), and the air-fuel mixture ignition timing is delayed (ignition timings b and<br>
44<br><br>
c). In other words, the air-fuel mixture ignition timing approaches the limit of misfire.<br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, a limit (threshold value) is put on the air intake throttle<br>
amount so that misfire of air-fuel mixture does not occur.<br>
Note that the threshold value may be previously set in the air intake throttling control signal<br>
as described above (a control signal which controls the throttle amount not to exceed the<br>
limit of misfire is transmitted). Alternatively, the threshold value may be previously set in<br>
the actuator of the air intake throttling device 24 (the actuator adjusts the opening degree of<br>
the butterfly valve within a range which does not exceed the threshold value (the limit of<br>
misfire), independently of the air intake throttling control signal).<br>
(Second embodiment)<br>
Next, a second embodiment will be described. This embodiment provides a variation of<br>
the "threshold value" which is defined as the limit of the air intake throttle amount in the<br>
first embodiment. The other parts and control operations are similar to those of the first<br>
embodiment. Therefore, the same portions as those of the first embodiment will not here<br>
described.<br>
As described above, as the intake air amount is decreased by the air intake throttling<br>
operation of the air intake throttling device 24, the time of ignition of air-fuel mixture is<br>
delayed. As a result, incomplete combustion occurs, so that the amount of CO and THC<br>
generated in exhaust gas increases. FIG. 6 shows a relationship between air intake throttle<br>
amounts and concentrations of CO and THC in exhaust gas. As can be seen from FIG. 6,<br>
in a region where the air intake throttle amount is relatively small, the rate of increase in the<br>
CO and THC concentration with respect to an increase in the air intake throttle amount is<br>
small. In a region where the air intake throttle amount is relatively large, the rate of<br>
increase in the CO and THC concentration with respect to an increase in the air intake<br>
throttle amount is extremely large.<br>
45<br><br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, an air intake throttle amount when reaching a maximum<br>
tolerance amount (hereinafter referred to as a CO and THC generation amount tolerance<br>
limit: point a in FIG. 6) of a range within which the amount of CO and THC generated is<br>
relatively small (hereinafter referred to as a CO and THC generation amount tolerance<br>
range: range A in FIG. 6), is defined as a first threshold value. An air intake throttle<br>
amount which is likely to cause the engine to stall due to misfire caused by the delay of the<br>
ignition time (hereinafter referred to as an engine running limit (the limit of misfire)) is<br>
previously set as a second threshold value (see FIG. 6).<br>
An operation of restoring the DPF 33 according to this embodiment is performed as follows.<br>
When the exhaust temperature increase control start condition is satisfied, the air intake<br>
throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is initially started. When the air<br>
intake throttle amount reaches the first threshold value without the exhaust gas temperature<br>
reaching the restoration operable temperature, the air intake throttling operation of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24 is temporarily suspended (the air intake throttle amount is<br>
maintained), while the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 is<br>
started. Specifically, the exhaust gas temperature is increased while the CO and THC<br>
generation amount is suppressed within the CO and THC generation amount tolerance<br>
range. Even if a predetermined time has passed since the activation of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34, the exhaust gas temperature detected by the exhaust<br>
temperature detecting sensor 37 may not reach the restoration operable temperature. In<br>
this case, the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is resumed<br>
so that the air intake throttle amount is increased with the second threshold value being an<br>
upper limit.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram showing changes over time in the exhaust gas temperature and the CO<br>
and THC concentration of exhaust gas when the operation is executed. As can be seen<br>
from FIG. 7, the exhaust gas temperature is gradually increased and the CO and THC<br>
concentration of exhaust gas is also gradually increased by the air intake throttling<br>
operation until the first threshold value is reached (the starting point of the air intake<br>
throttling operation is indicated by point a in FIG. 7). Thereafter, when the air intake<br>
46<br><br>
throttle amount reaches the first threshold value and the air intake throttling operation is<br>
then switched to the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34<br>
(point b in FIG. 7), the exhaust gas temperature is gradually increased while the oxidation<br>
catalyst function of the DPF 33 is exhibited due to heating to clean CO and THC, so that the<br>
CO and THC concentration is decreased. Thereafter, the heating ability of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34 reaches the limit, so that the air intake throttling operation<br>
of the air intake throttling device 24 is resumed (point c in FIG. 7), thereby further<br>
increasing the exhaust gas temperature. As a result, when the exhaust gas temperature<br>
reaches the restoration operable temperature, the restoration of the DPF 33 is started. Note<br>
that, when the exhaust gas temperature reaches the restoration operable temperature<br>
partway through the series of operations, the DPF 33 is restored by maintaining the state.<br>
For example, when the exhaust gas temperature is caused to reach the restoration operable<br>
temperature by the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34, the<br>
DPF 33 is restored without the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 being started.<br>
- Changing of threshold value, depending on running state of engine -<br>
When the running state of the engine changes, the CO and THC generation amount and the<br>
delay amount of the ignition time of air-fuel mixture change with respect to the air intake<br>
throttle amount. Therefore, the CO and THC generation amount tolerance range, the CO<br>
and THC generation amount tolerance limit, and the engine running limit also have<br>
different values. Therefore, the first threshold value and the second threshold value are<br>
also set to have different values, depending on the running state of the engine. Hereinafter,<br>
an operation of changing the first threshold value and the second threshold value will be<br>
described.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a case where each threshold value is changed, depending on the revolution<br>
number of the engine and the torque of the engine. As can be seen from FIG. 8, as the<br>
revolution number of the engine and the engine torque decrease, the first threshold value<br>
and the second threshold value can be set to be higher values (a larger margin of the air<br>
47<br><br>
intake throttle amount). In other words, as the revolution number of the engine and the<br>
engine torque increase, the first threshold value and the second threshold value need to be<br>
set to be lower values (the limitation of the air intake throttle amount is enhanced). For<br>
example, when the revolution number of the engine is low, but the load is high, there is a<br>
small margin of the intake air amount irrespective of the low exhaust gas temperature, so<br>
that the air intake throttle amount is likely to reach the engine running limit earlier.<br>
Therefore, in this situation, the second threshold value is set to be low. Thereby, the<br>
engine is prevented from stalling. When the revolution number of the engine is low,<br>
ignition may be delayed, but in this case, the angular velocity of the crank shaft is low, so<br>
that the angle of the crank at ignition timing is not significantly deviated from the dead<br>
point of the piston, and therefore, combustion is possible. Therefore, the first threshold<br>
value can be set to be higher. In other words, even if the air intake throttle amount is<br>
increased, the CO and THC generation amount can be suppressed within the tolerance<br>
range. Thus, by changing the threshold values, depending on a change in the running state<br>
of the engine, the restoration operation of the DPF 33 can be executed while the engine is<br>
prevented from stalling and the CO and THC generation amount is suppressed within the<br>
tolerance range as well as while the energy loss is suppressed to the extent possible.<br>
- Changing of threshold value, depending on cetane number of fuel -<br>
When the cetane number of a fuel (light oil for diesel engines) changes, the CO and THC<br>
generation amount and the delay amount of ignition of air-fuel mixture with respect to the<br>
air intake throttle amount also change. Therefore, the CO and THC generation amount<br>
tolerance range, the CO and THC generation amount tolerance limit, and the engine running<br>
limit also have different values. Therefore, the first threshold value and the second<br>
threshold value are also set to be different values, depending on the cetane number of a fuel<br>
to be used. Hereinafter, an operation of changing the first threshold value and the second<br>
threshold value will be described.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a relationship between air intake throttle amounts and concentrations of CO<br>
and THC in exhaust gas with respect to two fuels having different cetane numbers (e.g., a<br>
48<br><br>
fuel having a cetane number of "55" and a fuel having a cetane number of "45"). As can<br>
be seen from FIG. 9, fuels having lower cetane numbers tend to have larger ignition delays.<br>
Therefore, for fuels having lower cetane numbers, both the first threshold value and the<br>
second threshold value need to be set to be lower values (the limitation of the air intake<br>
throttle amount is enhanced), as compared to fuels having higher cetane numbers. In other<br>
words, since fuels having higher cetane numbers have smaller ignition delays, both the first<br>
threshold value and the second threshold value can be set to be higher values (there can be a<br>
margin of the air intake throttle amount), as compared to fuels having lower cetane<br>
numbers.<br>
Thus, by setting the threshold values, depending on the fuel, the restoration operation of the<br>
DPF 33 can be executed while the engine is prevented from stalling and the CO and THC<br>
generation amount is suppressed within the tolerance range.<br>
(Third embodiment)<br>
Next, a third embodiment will be described. In this embodiment, it is assumed that an<br>
electric heater is employed as the exhaust temperature increasing device 34, and current is<br>
supplied to the electric heater 34 directly from an alternator. The other parts and control<br>
operations are similar to those of the first and second embodiments. Therefore, the same<br>
portions as those of the first and second embodiments will not here described.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 10, in an engine of this embodiment, an alternator 61 which is<br>
driven by rotational drive force of a crank shaft to generate electric power is attached to a<br>
side surface of the engine main body 1. A portion of electric power generated by the<br>
alternator 61 is supplied to the electric heater (exhaust temperature increasing device) 34.<br>
The supply of electric power to the electric heater 34 is switched ON/OFF in accordance<br>
with the exhaust temperature increase control signal from the controller 5 as in the first<br>
embodiment. Note that the electric power generated by the alternator 61 is also used to<br>
charge a battery (not shown) or drive auxiliaries.<br>
49<br><br>
This embodiment is characterized by ON/OFF control of the electric heater 34 performed in<br>
accordance with the exhaust temperature increase control signal from the controller 5.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a relationship between an output of the engine main body 1 and a portion of<br>
the output which is used in the electric heater 34. In FIG. 11, a solid line indicates a limit<br>
of the output of the engine main body 1 (a maximum output line of the engine). In FIG. 11,<br>
a hatched region indicates an output of the engine which is used (consumed) in the electric<br>
heater 34 when the electric heater 34 is ON (a portion of the output of the engine which is<br>
used to generate heat in the electric heater 34).<br>
Therefore, when the engine main body 1 is driven with an output (e.g., point A in FIG. 11)<br>
lower than a dashed line in FIG. 11 (the load is relatively low), there is an output margin<br>
which is more than or equal to the portion of the output of the engine which is used in the<br>
electric heater 34. Therefore, even when the electric heater 34 is turned ON, the operation<br>
of heating exhaust gas by the electric heater 34 can be performed without a hindrance in the<br>
travel performance or the traction performance. Specifically, when there is a request for<br>
passage of current to the electric heater 34 in such a drive state of the engine (timing with<br>
which the heating activation of the electric heater 34 is executed in the above-described<br>
embodiments), the exhaust temperature increase control signal is transmitted from the<br>
controller 5 to the electric heater 34, so that the heating activation is started.<br>
In contrast to this, when the engine main body 1 is driven by an output (e.g., point B in FIG.<br>
11) which is higher than the dashed line in FIG. 11 (the load is relatively high), the output<br>
margin is smaller than the portion of the output of the engine which is used in the electric<br>
heater 34. In this case, the electric heater 34 is not turned ON, and the exhaust gas<br>
temperature is increased only by the air intake throttling operation of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24. In other words, even when there is a request for passage of current to<br>
the electric heater 34 in such a drive state of the engine, the exhaust temperature increase<br>
control signal is not transmitted from the controller 5 to the electric heater 34. Therefore,<br>
the exhaust gas temperature is increased only by the air intake throttling operation of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24, and when the exhaust gas temperature reaches the restoration<br>
50<br><br>
operable temperature, the restoration of the DPF 33 is performed. In other words, the<br>
restoration of the DPF 33 is performed without a hindrance in the travel performance or the<br>
traction performance.<br>
Although it has been described above that the electric heater 34 is not turned ON when the<br>
output margin of the engine main body 1 is smaller than the portion of the engine output<br>
which is used in the electric heater 34, the present invention is not limited to this.<br>
Alternatively, the electric heater 34 may be adapted to generate a plurality of variable levels<br>
of heat, and the heat level of the electric heater 34 may be adjusted, depending on the output<br>
margin of the engine, so that the operation of heating exhaust gas may be performed by the<br>
electric heater 34 to the extent possible.<br>
-Variation of third embodiment -<br>
In the above-described third embodiment, current is supplied to the electric heater 34 from<br>
the alternator 61 which generates electric power for charging a battery or driving auxiliaries.<br>
In this variation, as shown in FIG. 12, an electric generator 62 dedicated to supply of current<br>
to the electric heater 34 is provided. The electric generator 62 is driven by rotational drive<br>
force of a crank shaft to generate electric power as with the alternator 61.<br>
Also, in this variation, ON/OFF control of the electric heater 34 which is performed in<br>
accordance with the exhaust temperature increase control signal from the controller 5, is<br>
performed, depending on the output state of the engine when there is a request for passage<br>
of current to the electric heater 34, as in the third embodiment.<br>
Also, in this case, the electric heater 34 may be adapted to generate a plurality of variable<br>
levels of heat, and the heat level of the electric heater 34 may be adjusted, depending on the<br>
output margin of the engine, so that the operation of heating exhaust gas may be performed<br>
by the electric heater 34 to the extent possible.<br>
51<br><br>
(Fourth embodiment)<br>
Next, a fourth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by a<br>
control operation of an EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve during restoration of the<br>
DPF 33 when an EGR device is provided. The other parts and control operations are<br>
similar to those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore, the same portions as<br>
those of the above-described embodiments will not here described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, an engine according to this embodiment is provided with an EGR<br>
path 71 for recirculating exhaust from the exhaust system 3 to the air intake system 2. The<br>
EGR path 71 is provided with an EGR valve 72 the opening degree of which can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
This embodiment is characterized by an operation in which, while the air intake throttling<br>
operation is performed by the air intake throttling device 24, the opening degree of the EGR<br>
valve 72 is reduced, depending on the throttle amount of the butterfly valve.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a relationship between air intake throttle amounts of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 and degrees of opening of the EGR valve 72 during a control of the opening<br>
degree of the EGR valve 72 according to this embodiment. FIG. 15 shows exemplary<br>
changes over time in the opening degree of the EGR valve 72 with respect to the air intake<br>
throttle amount of the air intake throttling device 24.<br>
A recirculation amount of EGR gas is determined, based on a differential pressure between<br>
the air intake side and the exhaust side, and the opening degree of the EGR valve 72. As<br>
described above, during restoration of the DPF 33, since the air intake throttling operation<br>
of the air intake throttling device 24 is performed, the air intake-side pressure is decreased.<br>
In other words, when the opening degree of the EGR valve 72 is constant, the differential<br>
pressure between the air intake side and the exhaust side becomes large, so that the<br>
recirculation amount of exhaust increases more than necessary, likely leading to faulty<br>
combustion. Therefore, in this embodiment, as the air intake throttle amount of the air<br>
52<br><br>
intake throttling device 24 is increased (the air intake-side pressure is decreased), the<br>
opening degree of the EGR valve 72 is reduced, thereby maintaining a constant exhaust<br>
recirculation rate to maintain a satisfactory combustion state of air-fuel mixture.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, the revolution number of the engine and the engine torque are<br>
monitored during restoration of the DPF 33, and the EGR valve 72 is completely closed<br>
when changes in these amounts exceed predetermined amounts. FIG. 16 shows exemplary<br>
changes over time in the revolution number of the engine, the engine torque, the opening<br>
degree of the EGR valve 72, and the air intake throttle amount of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 in this case. When the opening degree of the EGR valve 72 is changed,<br>
depending on the air intake throttle amount of the air intake throttling device 24, during the<br>
restoration of the DPF 33, change in the EGR recirculation amount is slightly delayed with<br>
respect to the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24.<br>
Therefore, when the revolution number of the engine and the engine torque change<br>
significantly, the operation of changing the opening degree of the EGR valve 72 is likely to<br>
have an adverse influence on the combustion of air-fuel mixture. Therefore, as shown in<br>
FIG. 16, when the revolution number of the engine and the engine torque change<br>
significantly during the restoration of the DPF 33, it is determined that the opening degree<br>
of the EGR valve 72 cannot be caused to follow a change in the air intake throttle amount of<br>
the air intake throttling device 24, and the EGR valve 72 is forced to be completely closed<br>
(timing A in FIG. 16), so that the exhaust recirculation amount is caused to be "0", thereby<br>
avoiding faulty combustion. Thereafter, when changes in the revolution number of the<br>
engine and the engine torque become small, the control of changing the opening degree of<br>
the EGR valve 72, depending on the air intake throttle amount of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24, is resumed (timing B in FIG. 16).<br>
(Fifth embodiment)<br>
Next, a fifth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized in that,<br>
when a turbocharger is provided, a plurality of "threshold values" for changing restoration<br>
operations of the DPF 33 are set. The other parts and control operations are similar to<br>
53<br><br>
those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore, the same portions as those of the<br>
above-described embodiments will not here described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, an engine according to this embodiment comprises a turbocharger 8.<br>
The engine utilizes the fluid energy of exhaust gas to compress intake air to increase the air<br>
density, thereby increasing an output of the engine.<br>
As a "threshold value" for changing restoration operations of the DPF 33, a first threshold<br>
value is set as in the second embodiment. The first threshold value is set as an air intake<br>
throttle amount when the CO and THC generation amount reaches a maximum tolerance<br>
amount (a CO and THC generation amount tolerance limit) of a range within which the CO<br>
and THC generation amount is relatively small (CO and THC generation amount tolerance<br>
range). On the other hand, a second threshold value is set as an air intake throttle amount<br>
when surging of the turbocharger 8 occurs (see a first threshold value and a second<br>
threshold value in FIG. 18). The surging occurs because the compression ratio is<br>
maintained high by the turbocharger 8 irrespective of a reduction in the intake air amount<br>
caused by increasing the air intake throttle amount. In other words, the second threshold<br>
value is set as an air intake throttle amount at the limit of engine running in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
Note that, regarding the restoration operation of the DPF 33 in this embodiment, operations<br>
after the air intake throttle amount reaches the first threshold value are performed in a<br>
manner similar to that of the second embodiment. Specifically, when the exhaust<br>
temperature increase control start condition is satisfied, the air intake throttling operation of<br>
the air intake throttling device 24 is initially started. When the air intake throttle amount<br>
reaches the first threshold value without the exhaust gas temperature reaching the<br>
restoration operable temperature, the air intake throttling operation of the air intake<br>
throttling device 24 is temporarily suspended (the air intake throttle amount is maintained),<br>
and the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 is started. In<br>
other words, the exhaust gas temperature is increased while the CO and THC generation<br>
amount is suppressed within the CO and THC generation amount tolerance range. Even if<br>
54<br><br>
a predetermined time has passed since the activation of the exhaust temperature increasing<br>
device 34, the exhaust gas temperature detected by the exhaust temperature detecting sensor<br>
37 may not reach the restoration operable temperature. In this case, the air intake<br>
throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is resumed so as to increase the air<br>
intake throttle amount with the second threshold value being set as an upper limit thereof<br>
(within a range which does not cause surging of the turbocharger 8).<br>
FIG. 19 is a diagram showing changes over time in the exhaust gas temperature and the CO<br>
and THC concentration of exhaust gas when the above-described operation is executed.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 19, the exhaust gas temperature is gradually increased and the CO<br>
and THC concentration of exhaust gas is also gradually increased by the air intake throttling<br>
operation until the first threshold value is reached (the starting point of the air intake<br>
throttling operation is indicated by point a in FIG. 19). Thereafter, when the air intake<br>
throttle amount reaches the first threshold value and the air intake throttling operation is<br>
then switched to the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34<br>
(point b in FIG. 19), the exhaust gas temperature is gradually increased, while the oxidation<br>
catalyst function of the DPF 33 is exhibited due to heating to clean CO and THC, so that the<br>
CO and THC concentration is decreased. Thereafter, the heating ability of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34 reaches the limit, so that the air intake throttling operation<br>
of the air intake throttling device 24 is resumed (point c in FIG. 19), thereby further<br>
increasing the exhaust gas temperature. As a result, when the exhaust gas temperature<br>
reaches the restoration operable temperature, restoration of the DPF 33 is started. Note<br>
that, when the exhaust gas temperature reaches the restoration operable temperature<br>
partway through the series of operations, the DPF 33 is restored by maintaining the state.<br>
- Variation of fifth embodiment -<br>
As a variation of the fifth embodiment, setting of a threshold value and switching of<br>
restoration operations of the DPF 33, depending on the threshold value, where a<br>
turbocharger is provided with a waste gate valve, will be described.<br>
55<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 20, an engine according to this variation is provided with a turbocharger 8.<br>
An exhaust pipe 32 is provided with a waste gate valve 81, and a bypass path 82 for causing<br>
exhaust gas to bypass the turbocharger 8 when the waste gate valve 81 is opened.<br>
As "threshold values" for switching restoration operations of the DPF 33, a first threshold<br>
value and a second threshold value similar to those of the fifth embodiment are set. The<br>
first threshold value is set as an air intake throttle amount when the CO and THC generation<br>
amount tolerance limit is reached. The second threshold value is set as an air intake<br>
throttle amount when surging of the turbocharger 8 occurs while the closed state of the<br>
waste gate valve 81 is maintained.<br>
In addition, a third threshold value is set in this embodiment. When surging of the<br>
turbocharger 8 occurs (the waste gate valve 81 is closed and the air intake throttle amount<br>
then reaches the second threshold value), the surging of the turbocharger 8 is eliminated by<br>
opening the waste gate valve 81. Thereafter, by further reducing air intake to a certain<br>
level (a certain air intake throttle amount), the engine is likely to stall due to misfire caused<br>
by a delay in the ignition time by the air intake throttling operation. The third threshold<br>
value is set as such an air intake throttle amount (engine running limit (the limit of misfire))<br>
(see FIG. 18).<br>
A restoration operation of the DPF 33 of this variation is performed as follows. When the<br>
exhaust temperature increase control start condition is satisfied, the air intake throttling<br>
operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is initially started. When the air intake<br>
throttle amount reaches the first threshold value without the exhaust gas temperature<br>
reaching the restoration operable temperature, the air intake throttling operation of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24 is temporarily suspended (the air intake throttle amount is<br>
maintained), and the heating activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 is<br>
started. In other words, the exhaust gas temperature is increased while the CO and THC<br>
generation amount is suppressed within the CO and THC generation amount tolerance<br>
range. Even if a predetermined time has passed since the activation of the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34, the exhaust gas temperature detected by the exhaust<br>
56<br><br>
temperature detecting sensor 37 may not reach the restoration operable temperature. In<br>
this case, the air intake throttling operation of the air intake throttling device 24 is resumed<br>
so as to increase the air intake throttle amount while the waste gate valve 81 is maintained<br>
closed (turbocharging is being performed) until the air intake throttle amount reaches the<br>
second threshold value. Thereafter, when the air intake throttle amount reaches the second<br>
threshold value without the exhaust gas temperature reaching the restoration operable<br>
temperature, the waste gate valve 81 is opened to eliminate surging of the turbocharger 8,<br>
and in this situation, the air intake throttle amount is further increased with the third<br>
threshold value being set as an upper limit thereof.<br>
FIG. 21 shows exemplary changes over time in the air intake throttle amount of the air<br>
intake throttling device 24 and the opening degree of the waste gate valve 81. Note that,<br>
when the waste gate valve 81 is opened as described above, there is no longer the expansion<br>
work of exhaust gas in the turbocharger 8, so that exhaust gas can be introduced to the DPF<br>
33 while the exhaust gas temperature is maintained high, thereby making it possible to<br>
quickly increase the exhaust gas temperature introduced to the DPF 33 to the restoration<br>
operable temperature.<br>
Note that, in the above-described variation, the exhaust system 3 is provided with the<br>
bypass path 82 and the waste gate valve 81, and the waste gate valve 81 is opened so as to<br>
avoid surging of the turbocharger, thereby making it possible to perform a further reduction<br>
in air intake. Instead of this, the air intake system 2 may be provided with a bypass path<br>
which bypasses the turbocharger 8 and an air intake bypass valve which opens or closes the<br>
bypass path. The air intake bypass valve may be opened so as to avoid surging of the<br>
turbocharger, thereby making it possible to perform a further reduction in air intake.<br>
(Sixth embodiment)<br>
Next, a sixth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by an<br>
operation of estimating the PM accumulation amount. The other parts and control<br>
operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore, the same<br>
portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here described.<br>
57<br><br>
A pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 which is detected by the PM<br>
accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 comprised of a pressure sensor, increases with an<br>
increase in an internal temperature of the DPF 33. Therefore, when the PM accumulation<br>
amount is estimated based on the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33, the<br>
internal temperature of the DPF 33 also needs to be taken into consideration in addition to<br>
the pressure. When the load or the revolution number of the engine changes, so that the<br>
exhaust gas temperature increases, the increase rate of the actual internal temperature of the<br>
DPF 33 is delayed from that of the exhaust gas temperature. This is because the DPF 33<br>
itself has a heat capacity.<br>
In this embodiment, taking into consideration that the internal temperature of the DPF 33<br>
has an influence on the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 described above,<br>
and that the increase of the actual internal temperature of the DPF 33 is delayed from that of<br>
the exhaust gas temperature, the estimated value of the PM accumulation amount calculated<br>
from the actually detected values (the values of the pressure immediately upstream from the<br>
DPF 33 and the exhaust gas temperature) may be corrected using a correction amount<br>
which depends on these pressure and temperature values.<br>
FIG. 22 shows exemplary changes over time in the revolution number of the engine, the<br>
exhaust gas temperature (detected value), the internal temperature of the DPF 33, the<br>
pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 (detected value), and the estimated value<br>
of the PM accumulation amount. As shown in FIG. 22, as the revolution number of the<br>
engine is increased, the exhaust gas temperature and the pressure immediately upstream<br>
from the DPF 33 rapidly increase. In contrast to this, the internal temperature of the DPF<br>
33 slowly increases. The detected pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is<br>
affected by the internal temperature of the DPF 33 and therefore is slightly deviated from<br>
the true pressure value. Specifically, the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33<br>
is detected as a pressure lower than the true pressure value. When the PM accumulation<br>
amount is estimated based only on the detected pressure value, the resultant accumulation<br>
amount is smaller than the actual accumulation amount.<br>
58<br><br>
Therefore, here, the internal temperature of the DPF 33 is estimated, depending on a change<br>
in the detected exhaust gas temperature, and a correction amount for the estimated value of<br>
the PM accumulation amount is determined based on the estimated internal temperature of<br>
the DPF 33 and the detected pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33.<br>
Specifically, estimated values of the PM accumulation amount indicated by a solid line in<br>
FIG. 22 are calculated based on the detected pressures immediately upstream from the DPF<br>
33. By correcting the estimated values using predetermined correction amounts, estimated<br>
values of the PM accumulation amount indicated by a dashed line in FIG. 22 are calculated.<br>
Thereby, the PM accumulation amount can be correctly estimated by considering that the<br>
pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is affected by the internal temperature of<br>
the DPF 33 and that the actual increase of the internal temperature of the DPF 33 is delayed<br>
from the increase of the exhaust gas temperature.<br>
Although it has been described in the sixth embodiment that the internal temperature of the<br>
DPF 33 is estimated, depending on a change in the detected exhaust gas temperature, the<br>
internal temperature of the DPF 33 may be estimated, depending on a change in the<br>
revolution number or torque of the engine.<br>
(Seventh embodiment)<br>
Next, a seventh embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by a<br>
control which sets timing of starting the restoration operation of the DPF 33. The other<br>
parts and control operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments.<br>
Therefore, the same portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here<br>
described.<br>
As a PM collection operation and a restoration operation of the DPF 33 are repeatedly<br>
performed, PM which is not removed by the restoration operation is accumulated in the<br>
DPF 33. Such PM includes the ash of lubricating oil, the abrasion powder of the engine,<br>
and the like. Due to their presence, even if the restoration operation is performed for a<br>
59<br><br>
long time, the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 cannot be returned<br>
(decreased) to the immediately upstream pressure of a brand-new product. In such a<br>
situation, when a pressure at which restoration of the DPF 33 is started is set to be a<br>
predetermined value, the following problem arises.<br>
Specifically, a restoration operation may be ended when a predetermined time has passed<br>
since the start of the restoration operation. In this case, at the end of the restoration<br>
operation, the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 has already been higher<br>
than that of a brand-new product, so that a difference from the restoration starting pressure<br>
is smaller. The difference is decreased every time the PM collection operation and<br>
restoration operation of the DPF 33 is repeated. Therefore, a time interval from the time of<br>
the end of the restoration operation until the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF<br>
33 reaches the restoration starting pressure decreases, so that the frequency of execution of<br>
a restoration operation increases. In FIG. 23, a dashed line indicates a situation where the<br>
frequency of execution of a restoration operation gradually increases.<br>
On the other hand, if a restoration operation is ended when the pressure immediately<br>
upstream from the DPF 33 decreases to a predetermined pressure (restoration ending<br>
pressure) after the start of the restoration operation, the pressure immediately upstream<br>
from the DPF 33 at the end of restoration increases every time the PM collection operation<br>
and restoration operation of the DPF 33 are repeated as described above. Therefore, even<br>
when the restoration operation is performed for a long time, the pressure immediately<br>
upstream from the DPF 33 does not decrease to the restoration ending pressure. In such a<br>
situation, the restoration operation cannot be end.<br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, a fuel injection amount of an engine to which the DPF 33 is<br>
attached is integrated since it is brand-new. Both the restoration starting pressure and the<br>
restoration ending pressure are updated with gradually increasing values, depending on the<br>
integration value. In FIG. 23, a dash-dot-dot line indicates set values of the restoration<br>
starting pressure and the restoration ending pressure. In FIG. 23, a solid line indicates how<br>
restoration operations are executed (changes in the pressure immediately upstream from the<br>
60<br><br>
DPF 33). As can be seen from FIG. 23, according to this embodiment, restoration<br>
operations can be executed in constant intervals, and a situation where a restoration<br>
operation cannot be ended is avoided.<br>
(Eighth embodiment)<br>
Next, an eighth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by<br>
setting of a restoration temperature (target temperature) of the DPF 33. The other parts<br>
and control operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments.<br>
Therefore, the same portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here<br>
described.<br>
When the DPF 33 is restored, the internal temperature distribution is such that a center<br>
portion thereof has a high temperature (the restoration operable temperature or more), while<br>
an outer circumferential portion thereof has a relatively low temperature because it is<br>
exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, it is likely that the outer circumferential portion<br>
does not reach the restoration operable temperature, so that faulty restoration occurs. If<br>
such a state continues, PM is accumulated in high density in the outer circumferential<br>
portion, and the PM is oxidized and its temperature is considerably increased during a<br>
restoration operation or the like, likely leading to melting damage of the DPF 33. FIG.<br>
24(a) is a cross-sectional view showing an inner portion of the DPF 33 before the start of a<br>
restoration operation. FIG. 24(b) is a cross-sectional view of the inner portion of the DPF<br>
33 after the restoration operation, indicating that PM is accumulated in the outer<br>
circumferential portion.<br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, a pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is<br>
detected upon completion of a restoration operation. When the pressure is higher than a<br>
predetermined value, it is determined that faulty restoration occurs in the outer<br>
circumferential portion of the DPF 33 and PM is accumulated in the outer circumferential<br>
portion. Therefore, a restoration temperature (target temperature) in the next restoration<br>
operation is set to be higher than the current restoration temperature (e.g., increased by 50<br>
61<br><br>
degrees). Thereby, in the next restoration operation, the temperature of the outer<br>
circumferential portion of the DPF 33 is increased. When the temperature reaches the<br>
restoration operable temperature, PM can be removed from the outer circumferential<br>
portion. When the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is still higher than the<br>
predetermined value upon completion of the current restoration operation, a restoration<br>
temperature (target temperature) in the next restoration operation is set to be even higher.<br>
Thus, the restoration temperature continues to be updated until the restoration temperature<br>
reaches the temperature at which PM can be removed from the outer circumferential portion<br>
of the DPF 33 by a restoration operation.<br>
FIG. 25 is a diagram showing changes over time in the pressure immediately upstream from<br>
the DPF 33 when the restoration temperature is changed as described above and when the<br>
restoration temperature is not changed. In FIG. 25, a solid line indicates changes in the<br>
pressure when the restoration temperature is not changed, while a dashed line indicates<br>
changes in the pressure when the restoration temperature is changed. Thus, when the<br>
restoration temperature is not changed, the accumulation amount of PM in the outer<br>
circumferential portion of the DPF 33 increases, so that the pressure immediately upstream<br>
from the DPF 33 upon completion of a restoration operation also increases. In contrast to<br>
this, in this embodiment, by changing the restoration temperature, it is possible to<br>
effectively remove PM from the outer circumferential portion of the DPF 33 (the pressure<br>
immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is maintained low upon completion of a restoration<br>
operation), thereby making it possible to execute restoration operations in constant intervals<br>
without an increase in the frequency of the restoration operation.<br>
(Ninth embodiment)<br>
Next, a ninth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by setting<br>
of timing with which restoration of the DPF 33 is ended. The other parts and control<br>
operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore, the same<br>
portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here described.<br>
62<br><br>
During a restoration operation of the DPF 33, the air intake throttling operation or the<br>
heating operation of the electric heater is performed, so that the fuel efficiency of the engine<br>
is deteriorated. Therefore, the restoration operation is preferably executed as quickly as<br>
possible.<br>
In this embodiment, as in the seventh embodiment, for example, the fuel injection amount<br>
of the engine is integrated from when it is brand-new (the DPF 33 is attached), and the<br>
restoration ending pressure is updated with a gradually increasing value, depending on the<br>
integrated value. In FIG 26, a dashed line indicates changes in pressure in a case where a<br>
restoration operation is ended when a predetermined time has passed since the start of the<br>
restoration operation. As shown in FIG. 26, when the restoration ending timing is set<br>
based on time, the restoration operation may be continued, though restoration has been<br>
sufficiently done, so that a useless restoration operation may be performed (time Tl in FIG<br>
26), or the restoration operation may be ended, though restoration has not yet been<br>
completed (timing T2 in FIG 26).<br>
In contrast to this, according to this embodiment, the execution time of a restoration<br>
operation is changed, depending on the state of restoration of the DPF 33. Thereby, the<br>
restoration operation (the air intake throttling operation or the heating operation of the<br>
electric heater) can be ended substantially at the same time when restoration is completed<br>
(see a solid line in FIG. 26). Therefore, the situation where a useless restoration operation<br>
is performed and the situation where a restoration operation is ended, though restoration has<br>
not yet been completed, can be avoided, thereby making it possible to improve the<br>
reliability of a restoration operation.<br>
(Tenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a tenth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is characterized by an<br>
operation of setting (returning) the restoration temperature (target temperature) of the DPF<br>
33 which is set to be high in the eighth embodiment, to be lower. The other parts and<br>
control operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore,<br>
the same portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here described.<br>
63<br><br>
When the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 sharply decreases, i.e., removal<br>
of PM has been completed quickly, heat is largely generated in the DPF 33, leading to<br>
abnormal restoration which is likely to damage the DPF 33. Therefore, in this<br>
embodiment, the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 is monitored. When the<br>
pressure sharply decreases, the restoration temperature (target temperature) of the DPF 33<br>
which is set to be high in the eighth embodiment, is set to be lower.<br>
Specifically, when the execution time of a restoration operation is extremely short or when<br>
a change gradient (decreasing gradient) of the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF<br>
33 is steep (a region T in FIG. 27), it is determined that PM remaining in the outer<br>
circumferential portion of the DPF 33 has been removed, so that the restoration temperature<br>
(target temperature) of the DPF 33 is set to be lower. As this operation, the restoration<br>
temperature may be decreased by a predetermined temperature (e.g., 50 degrees) every time<br>
a restoration operation is executed, or alternatively, the restoration temperature may be<br>
decreased to the restoration operable temperature (300Â°C) at once.<br>
- Variation of tenth embodiment -<br>
A variation of the tenth embodiment will be hereinafter described. In this embodiment,<br>
when the pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 sharply decreases, a restoration<br>
operation is ended even if the restoration operation has not yet been completed. Thereby,<br>
abnormal restoration is reliably avoided in the DPF 33 to avoid damage of the DPF 33.<br>
In FIG. 28, a restoration operation is started with timing Tl, restoration proceeds so that the<br>
pressure immediately upstream from the DPF 33 gradually (relatively slowly) decreases,<br>
and thereafter, the pressure sharply decreases (the pressure sharply decreases with timing<br>
T2 in FIG. 28). Therefore, the restoration operation is ended with timing T3 in FIG. 28<br>
(the air intake throttling operation and the heating operation of the electric heater is<br>
forbidden), thereby avoiding damage of the DPF 33.<br>
64<br><br>
(Eleventh embodiment)<br>
Next, an eleventh embodiment will be described. This embodiment relates to a technique<br>
for avoiding melting damage of the DPF 33 which is caused because the restoration<br>
reaction of the DPF 33 continues after the engine is suspended. The other parts and<br>
control operations are similar to those of the above-described embodiments. Therefore,<br>
the same portions as those of the above-described embodiment will not here described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 29, in an engine according to this embodiment, the exhaust pipe 32 is<br>
provided with an exhaust throttling device (exhaust throttling means) 38 downstream from<br>
the DPF 33. Specifically, the exhaust throttling device 38 comprises a butterfly valve and<br>
an actuator which rotates the butterfly valve to change the flow path area of the exhaust<br>
pipe 32 (both not shown) as with the air intake throttling device 24, and the actuator is<br>
controlled by the controller 5. Note that the valve mechanism is not limited to butterfly<br>
valves, and shutter valves and the like are applicable.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 30 (indicating changes over time in the revolution<br>
number of the engine, the exhaust throttle amount, and the air intake throttle amount), when<br>
the engine is suspended, the throttle amount of the air intake throttling device 24 is<br>
maximized (completely closed), and the throttle amount of the exhaust throttling device 38<br>
is maximized (completely closed). Thereby, air (oxygen) is prevented from being<br>
introduced to the DPF 33 from the air intake system 2 and the exhaust system 3, thereby<br>
forbidding progress of the restoration reaction of the DPF 33. Thereby, melting damage of<br>
the DPF 33 is avoided.<br>
- Variation in eleventh embodiment -<br>
A variation of the eleventh embodiment will be hereinafter described. In this embodiment,<br>
as shown in FIG. 31 (indicating changes over time in the revolution number of the engine,<br>
the fuel injection amount, the exhaust throttle amount, and the air intake throttle amount),<br>
not only the throttle amount of the air intake throttling device 24 is maximized (completely<br>
65<br><br>
closed) and the throttle amount of the exhaust throttling device 38 is maximized<br>
(completely closed) when the engine is suspended, but also fuel injection which has been<br>
suspended in the engine suspension operation is executed when the revolution number of<br>
the engine decreases to a predetermined revolution number (e.g., about 700 rpm) (timing T<br>
in FIG. 31). Thereby, oxygen remaining in the cylinder is subjected to combustion so as to<br>
avoid introduction of oxygen to the DPF 33, thereby forbidding progress of the restoration<br>
reaction of the DPF 33 so as to avoid melting damage of the DPF 33. In this case, the fuel<br>
injection amount is preferably set to be larger than the fuel injection amount immediately<br>
before the start of the engine suspension operation, thereby reliably performing combustion<br>
of remaining oxygen. The throttle amount of the exhaust throttling device 38 may be<br>
maximized either after the throttle amount of the air intake throttling device 24 is<br>
maximized and immediately after fuel injection is executed during suspension of the engine,<br>
or at the same time when the throttle amount of the exhaust throttling device 38 is<br>
maximized.<br>
(Twelfth embodiment)<br>
Next, a twelfth embodiment will be described. The twelfth embodiment is the same as the<br>
first embodiment which has been described with reference to FIG. 1, except for the<br>
following points. Therefore, the same portions will be described as less as possible, and<br>
differences will be mainly described.<br>
Firstly, a specific structure of the filter main body housed in the casing of the DPF 33 and a<br>
configuration of the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 will be described.<br>
- Filter main body 35 -<br>
A specific structure of a filter main body 35 will be hereinafter described. As shown in<br>
FIG. 32 (a view of the filter main body 35 as viewed in a direction along a flow direction of<br>
exhaust gas) and FIG. 33 (a cross-sectional view of the filter main body 35 as viewed in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the flow direction of exhaust gas), the filter main body 35, which<br>
66<br><br>
has substantially a cylindrical shape, comprises an outer circumferential wall 35a and a<br>
partition wall 35b which is integrally formed in a lattice within an internal circumference of<br>
the outer circumferential wall 35a. By the partition wall 35b, a number of flow paths 35c,<br>
35d,... are formed in a honeycomb structure.<br>
As the flow paths 35c, 35d, ..., primary flow paths 35c which are sealed by sealing<br>
members 35e only at an exhaust gas flow-out side, and secondary flow paths 35d which are<br>
sealed by sealing members 35e only at an exhaust gas flow-in side, are alternately provided.<br>
With this structure, exhaust gas flowing into the primary flow path 35c passes through the<br>
partition wall 35b to flow into the secondary flow path 35d before being emitted out<br>
through the exhaust pipe 32. In other words, when the exhaust gas passes through the<br>
partition wall 35b, PM contained in the exhaust gas is collected at the primary side of the<br>
filter main body 35. In FIG. 33, arrows indicate flows of exhaust gas in the flow paths 35c,<br>
35d, ..., and closed arrows indicate exhaust gas containing PM, i.e., exhaust gas flowing in<br>
the primary flow paths 35c. Open arrows indicate exhaust gas after PM is collected and<br>
removed, i.e., exhaust gas flowing in the secondary flow paths 35d.<br>
The filter main body 35 is formed of a nonconductive material, such as porous cordierite<br>
ceramics, silicon carbide, alumina, mullite, silicon nitride, or the like, which has heat<br>
resistance, oxidation resistance, and thermal shock resistance. The filter main body 35<br>
also has an oxidation catalyst, such as platinum or the like. Thereby, in the DPF 33, when<br>
the exhaust gas temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature (e.g., 300Â°C; hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "restoration operable temperature"), the chemical reaction is carried out, so<br>
that PM is removed by oxidation, i.e., the DPF 33 is restored.<br>
- PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 -<br>
This embodiment is characterized by a configuration of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36 for detecting the PM accumulation amount in the filter main body 35.<br>
Hereinafter, the configuration of the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 will be<br>
described.<br>
67<br><br>
FIG. 34 is a cross-sectional view schematically showing the filter main body 35<br>
(corresponding to FIG. 33). As shown in FIG. 34, electrical wires (conductive wires) 36a<br>
and 36b are connected to two portions (points X and Y in FIG. 34) of an inner surface of the<br>
primary flow path 35c in the filter main body 35. An electrical resistance detecting sensor<br>
36c is connected to the electrical wires 36a and 36b. In other words, the electrical<br>
resistance detecting sensor 36c can detect an electrical resistance value between the two<br>
portions X and Y (the portions to which the electrical wires 36a and 36b are connected) of<br>
the inner surface of the primary flow path 35c. Information about the electrical resistance<br>
value thus detected is transmitted to an accumulation amount estimating means (described<br>
below) provided in the restoration controller 5.<br>
The connection portions X and Y of the electrical wires 36a and 36b with respect to the<br>
inner surface of the primary flow path 35c are placed and separated by a distance such that,<br>
when PM is accumulated on the inner surface of the primary flow path 35c to such an<br>
extent that a restoration operation of the DPF is required (e.g., PM is attached to about 70%<br>
of the inner surface of the primary flow path 35c), PM is continuously attached across<br>
between the two connection portions X and Y of the electrical wires 36a and 36b as shown<br>
in FIG. 35, i.e., the two connection portions X and Y are electrically conductive via PM. In<br>
other words, if the distance is excessively short, the two points X and Y are electrically<br>
conductive when only a small amount of PM is attached. Conversely, if the distance is<br>
excessively long, the two points X and Y are not electrically conductive when PM is<br>
attached in an amount which requires a restoration operation of the DPF. The distance is<br>
set to be a value which avoids these situations.<br>
Also, an exhaust temperature increasing device (exhaust heating means) 34 is provided<br>
upstream from the DPF 33 in the exhaust pipe 32 (see FIG. 1). The exhaust temperature<br>
increasing device 34, which is comprised of an electric heater, receives electric power from<br>
an electric generator (alternator; not shown) and generates heat, thereby making it possible<br>
to heat exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust pipe 32. Specifically, exhaust gas may be<br>
indirectly heated by heating the exhaust pipe 32, or gas may be directly heated by providing<br>
68<br><br>
a heater line in the exhaust pipe 32. Note that a flame burner may be applicable as the<br>
exhaust temperature increasing device 34.<br>
Also, an exhaust temperature detecting sensor (exhaust temperature detecting means) 37 for<br>
detecting the exhaust gas temperature is attached to the exhaust temperature increasing<br>
device 34. The exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37 may be provided in the exhaust<br>
temperature increasing device 34, or may be attached to the exhaust pipe 32 immediately<br>
upstream from the DPF 33.<br>
This engine is provided with a restoration controller 5 for controlling the restoration<br>
operation of the DPF 33. The controller 5 receives a PM accumulation amount detection<br>
signal (a signal based on an electrical resistance) transmitted from the PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensor 36 and an exhaust temperature detection signal transmitted from<br>
the exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37. As described above, the restoration controller<br>
5, which is provided with an accumulation amount estimating means, calculates a PM<br>
accumulation amount on a surface of the primary flow path 35c of the filter main body 35<br>
based on an electrical resistance value detected by the electrical resistance detecting sensor<br>
36c. Specifically, since the electrical resistance value varies depending on the filter<br>
temperature, a temperature of the filter main body 35 is detected by a means (not shown),<br>
such as a temperature sensor or the like, and the electrical resistance value detected by the<br>
electrical resistance detecting sensor 36c is subjected to a correction calculation based on<br>
the temperature of the filter main body 35, thereby estimating the PM accumulation amount<br>
with high accuracy.<br>
As can be seen from the relationship between filter temperatures and electrical resistance<br>
values in FIG. 6, even when the PM accumulation amount is the same, the higher the filter<br>
temperature, the lower the electrical resistance value. In view of this, for example, a<br>
correction calculation is performed using the following correction expression, thereby<br>
making it possible to estimate the PM accumulation amount with high accuracy.<br>
69<br><br>
R = aT2 + bT + c<br>
R: electrical resistance value, T: temperature, a, b, c: coefficients<br>
The controller 5 transmits control signals to the air intake throttling device 24 and the<br>
exhaust temperature increasing device 34 in accordance with the estimated PM<br>
accumulation amount and the exhaust temperature detection signal from the exhaust<br>
temperature detecting sensor 37. Specifically, the actuator of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 is activated in accordance with the air intake throttling control signal transmitted<br>
to the air intake throttling device 24, so that the butterfly valve is rotated so as to obtain the<br>
opening degree corresponding to the air intake throttling control signal. Also, the electric<br>
heater is ON/OFF controlled in accordance with the exhaust temperature increase control<br>
signal transmitted to the exhaust temperature increasing device 34, thereby controlling the<br>
exhaust gas heating operation by the electric heater.<br>
- DPF restoration control operation -<br>
Next, a DPF restoration control operation of the thus-configured system will be described.<br>
In this embodiment, the air intake throttling device 24 and the exhaust temperature<br>
increasing device 34 are controlled, depending on the PM accumulation amount and the<br>
exhaust gas temperature in the DPF 33. Specifically, the controller 5 receives an electrical<br>
resistance signal from the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 and estimates the<br>
PM accumulation amount using the accumulation amount estimating means provided in the<br>
controller 5. When it is determined that the PM accumulation amount has exceeded a<br>
predetermined amount, and it is determined based on the exhaust temperature detection<br>
signal received by the controller 5 from the exhaust temperature detecting sensor 37 that the<br>
exhaust gas temperature has not reached the restoration operable temperature (hereinafter<br>
the case where these two conditions are satisfied is referred to as a "case where the exhaust<br>
temperature increase control start condition is satisfied"), one or both of the air intake<br>
70<br><br>
throttling device 24 and the exhaust temperature increasing device 34 are activated so as to<br>
increase the exhaust gas temperature to the restoration operable temperature. Thereby, a<br>
restoration operation of the DPF 33 is performed while the engine main body 1 continues to<br>
be run. Hereinafter, a plurality of specific operations will be described.<br>
- Air intake throttling priority operation -<br>
An operation in which priority is given to the air intake throttling of the air intake throttling<br>
device 24 is substantially similar to the first embodiment. When the exhaust temperature<br>
increase control start condition is satisfied, the controller 5 initially transmits an air intake<br>
throttling control signal to the air intake throttling device 24. Thereby, the actuator of the<br>
air intake throttling device 24 is activated to rotate the butterfly valve so as to obtain an<br>
opening degree corresponding to the air intake throttling control signal, so that the flow<br>
path area of the air intake pipe 21 is reduced. As a result, the intake air amount is reduced<br>
to enrich the air-fuel ratio, so that the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber is<br>
increased and therefore the exhaust gas temperature is increased. When the exhaust gas<br>
temperature thereby reaches the restoration operable temperature, the DPF 33 is restored<br>
without activation of the exhaust temperature increasing device 34.<br>
FIG. 37 is a timing chart showing changes over time in the electrical resistance value<br>
detected by the electrical resistance detecting sensor 36c and restoration operation timing in<br>
this case. Initially, the engine is run without execution of a restoration operation. As PM<br>
is accumulated, the electrical resistance value gradually decreases. When the electrical<br>
resistance value becomes smaller than a predetermined restoration starting threshold value<br>
(timing A in FIG. 37), a restoration operation is started. Immediately after the start of the<br>
restoration operation, the temperature of the filter main body 35 has not yet reached the<br>
restoration operable temperature, so that the electrical resistance value continues decreasing.<br>
When the temperature of the filter main body 35 reaches the restoration operable<br>
temperature, PM starts to be removed, so that the electrical resistance value gradually<br>
increases. Thereafter, when the electrical resistance value exceeds a predetermined<br>
restoration ending threshold value (timing B in FIG. 37), the restoration operation is ended.<br>
71<br><br>
Note that an electrical resistance value set as the restoration ending threshold value is set to<br>
be higher than an electrical resistance value set as the restoration starting threshold value,<br>
thereby avoiding a situation where start and suspension of a filter restoration operation are<br>
frequently repeated.<br>
Note that, when a change rate of the electrical resistance value detected by the electrical<br>
resistance detecting sensor 36c during a restoration operation (an increase amount of the<br>
electrical resistance value per unit time) becomes higher than a predetermined abnormality<br>
determination change rate (a slope a becomes larger than a predetermined angle in FIG. 38),<br>
the filter restoration operation is forcedly suspended. The reason is as follows. When the<br>
electrical resistance value sharply changes in this manner, a portion of the filter main body<br>
35 is likely to locally have an abnormally high temperature (abnormal restoration). If the<br>
"abnormal restoration" state continues, melting damage of the DPF 33 is likely to occur.<br>
Therefore, when the change rate of the electrical resistance value becomes high, the<br>
restoration operation is ended. Thereby, it is possible to extend the life of the DPF 33.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, the electrical wires 36a and 36b are connected to<br>
the two portions X and Y of the surface of the primary flow path 35c of the filter main body<br>
35, and the PM accumulation amount is recognized based on the electrical resistance<br>
between the two points X and Y. Specifically, as the PM accumulation amount increases,<br>
so that the accumulation thickness increases, the electrical resistance value gradually<br>
decreases. Therefore, by recognizing a change in the electrical resistance value, the PM<br>
accumulation amount can be detected. Therefore, the reliability of the PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting operation can be improved as compared to the conventional art in which a<br>
pressure difference between an upstream side and a downstream side of a filter is detected<br>
by a pressure sensor, or a PM generation amount or the like corresponding to a running state<br>
of an engine is read out and calculated from a map. In addition, this embodiment provides<br>
a relatively simple configuration in which wires (conductive wires) for detecting an<br>
electrical resistance are connected to the filter, thereby making it possible to improve the<br>
practicability.<br>
72<br><br>
(Thirteenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a thirteenth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is different from the<br>
first embodiment in the configuration of the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36.<br>
Therefore, only the configuration of the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 will<br>
be here described.<br>
Although the single PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 having a pair of the<br>
electrical wires 36a and 36b is provided in the first embodiment, two PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensors 36A and 36B each having a pair of electrical wires 36a and 36b<br>
are provided in this embodiment as shown in FIG. 39. The electrical wires 36a and 36b of<br>
the PM accumulation amount detecting sensors 36A and 36B are connected to the filter<br>
main body 35 at the same distance from a center point of the filter main body 35.<br>
Assuming that the two PM accumulation amount detecting sensors 36A and 36B are<br>
provided, even if disconnection occurs in the electrical wires 36a and 36b of one PM<br>
accumulation amount detecting sensor (e.g., 36A), it is possible to detect an electrical<br>
resistance between two points on the filter main body 35 by the other PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensor (e.g., 36B), thereby making it possible to secure the reliability of<br>
the PM accumulation amount detecting operation.<br>
Also, in the configuration of this embodiment, when disconnection occurs in the electrical<br>
wires 36a and 36b of one PM accumulation amount detecting sensor (e.g., 36A), an<br>
electrical resistance value detected by the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36A is<br>
continually infinite. Therefore, by recognizing this state, the occurrence of disconnection<br>
of the electrical wires 36a and 36b of the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36A<br>
can be readily recognized, thereby making it possible to invalidate an output signal from the<br>
PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36A.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, since the two PM accumulation amount detecting sensors 36A<br>
and 36B are provided, each of them detects an electrical resistance between two points of<br>
73<br><br>
the filter main body 35. Therefore, if these detected electrical resistance values are<br>
different from each other, the lower electrical resistance value is recognized as a true<br>
electrical resistance value, and the PM accumulation amount is estimated based on the<br>
lower electrical resistance value. This is to address nonuniform accumulation (biased<br>
accumulation) of PM with respect to the filter main body 35. Of the portions where<br>
electrical resistances are detected, a portion having a largest PM accumulation amount is<br>
used as a reference to determine timing of starting the filter restoration operation. For<br>
example, assuming that an electrical resistance value detected by one PM accumulation<br>
amount detecting sensor (e.g., 36A) is higher than an electrical resistance value detected by<br>
the other PM accumulation amount detecting sensor (e.g., 36B), there is a possibility that,<br>
although the electrical resistance value detected by the PM accumulation amount detecting<br>
sensor 36A is recognized as a true electrical resistance value, PM is excessively<br>
accumulated at a portion which is subjected to detection of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36B. In this case, a temperature is excessively increased at that portion<br>
during a filter restoration operation, likely leading to damage of the filter main body 35.<br>
To avoid such a situation, a lowest detected electrical resistance value (an electrical<br>
resistance value at a portion where PM is most accumulated) is recognized as a true<br>
electrical resistance value as described above.<br>
Although the two PM accumulation amount detecting sensors 36A and 36B each having a<br>
pair of electrical wires 36a and 36b are provided in this embodiment, three or more PM<br>
accumulation amount detecting sensors may be provided. Also, in this case, as described<br>
above, a lowest detected electrical resistance value is preferably recognized as a true<br>
electrical resistance value, thereby avoiding damage of the filter main body 35 during a<br>
restoration operation.<br>
(Fourteenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a fourteenth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is different from the<br>
first and thirteenth embodiments in the configuration of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36. Therefore, only the configuration of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36 will also be here described.<br>
74<br><br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 40, an electrical resistance between each of three<br>
points (points X, Y and Z in FIG. 40) on the filter main body 35 is detected. Specifically,<br>
electrical wires (conductive wires) 36a, 36b and 36d are connected to the three points,<br>
respectively. Electrical resistance detecting sensors 36c, 36c and 36c are provided so as to<br>
detect electrical resistances between these electrical wires 36a, 36b and 36d.<br>
According to the configuration of this embodiment, when no disconnection occurs in the<br>
electrical wires connected to the points (X, Y and Z),<br>
r1 - r2 = r3 = r<br>
where rl, r2 and r3 represent resistance values between the points (in the absence of biased<br>
accumulation). Electrical resistance values detected between the points are represented by:<br>
R(X, Y) = R(Y, Z) = R(Z, X) = R = (2/3)r<br>
where R(X, Y) represents a resistance value between "point X" and "point Y", R(Y, Z)<br>
represents a resistance value between "point Y" and "point Z", and R(Z, X) represents a<br>
resistance value between "point Z" and "point X".<br>
On the other hand, when disconnection occurs in one of the electrical wires connected to the<br>
points (disconnection in an electrical wire connected to "point X"),<br>
R(X, Y) = ï¥<br>
R(Z, X) = ï¥<br>
R(Y,Z) = r.<br>
The electrical resistance value of R(Y, Z) suddenly increases by a factor of 1.5 (1.5 times<br>
higher than when disconnection does not occur). Thereby, by recognizing such a sharp<br>
increase in the electrical resistance value, disconnection in a wire can be readily recognized.<br>
75<br><br>
Note that, even in such a configuration for detecting electrical resistances between three<br>
points on the filter main body 35, a lowest detected electrical resistance value is recognized<br>
as a true electrical resistance value as described above.<br>
(Fifteenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a fifteenth embodiment will be described. This embodiment is also different from<br>
the above-described embodiments in the configuration of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36. Therefore, only the configuration of the PM accumulation amount<br>
detecting sensor 36 will be here described.<br>
The PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 according to this embodiment has a<br>
function of detecting an electrical resistance between two points as in the first and thirteenth<br>
embodiments. In addition, a function of detecting a temperature at a connection portion of<br>
the electrical wire 36a on the filter main body 35 is also provided.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 41, an electrical wire 36e made of a material different from<br>
that of the electrical wire 36a is connected to a point (point X above) which is subjected to<br>
measurement of an electrical resistance. A closed circuit is formed by the electrical wires<br>
36a and 36e. A voltage detecting sensor 36f is connected to the circuit. Regarding<br>
specific materials for the electrical wires 36a, 36b and 36e, the electrical wires 36a and 36b<br>
for detecting an electrical resistance are made of Alumel (alloy of Ni and Al), and the<br>
electrical wire 36e for detecting a voltage is made of Chromel (alloy of Ni and Cr). In<br>
other words, the electrical wire 36a for detecting an electrical resistance is used to construct<br>
a thermocouple.<br>
With the configuration of this embodiment, by measuring a temperature of a point where an<br>
electrical resistance is to be measured, it can be determined whether or not a restoration<br>
operation is being normally performed (a restoration operation is being performed at<br>
appropriate temperature).<br>
76<br><br>
When a plurality of PM accumulation amount detecting sensors 36A and 36B are provided<br>
as in the thirteenth embodiment and each of them is provided with a function as a<br>
thermocouple, it can be recognized whether or not the temperature of the filter main body<br>
35 is biased, by measuring a temperature at each point during a restoration operation.<br>
When the temperature is biased, it can be determined that biased accumulation of PM<br>
occurs. Thereby, it is possible to determine whether or not the DPF 33 needs to be<br>
subjected to a maintenance process. Also, in the PM accumulation amount detecting<br>
sensor 36 of FIG. 41, by constructing a thermocouple with respect to the right electrical<br>
wire 36b as is similar to the left electrical wire 36a, a temperature can be measured at a<br>
plurality of points.<br>
Note that, when the PM accumulation amount is calculated based on a filter temperature in<br>
this manner, a thermocouple employing the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36<br>
as described above or an individual temperature sensor may be used as a means for<br>
measuring the filter temperature.<br>
(Sixteenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a sixteenth embodiment will be described. This embodiment comprises a pressure<br>
sensor (not shown) for detecting a pressure difference between an upstream side and a<br>
downstream side of the DPF 33 in addition to the PM accumulation amount detecting<br>
sensor 36 of the above-described embodiments. Specifically, the controller 5 receives an<br>
output from the PM accumulation amount detecting sensor 36 and an output from the<br>
pressure sensor. Also, the controller 5 comprises a maintenance determining means for<br>
determining whether or not the DPF 33 needs to be subjected to a maintenance process,<br>
based on the outputs.<br>
In general, examples of matter accumulated on the DPF 33 include matter which cannot be<br>
removed (e.g., ash due to attachment of lubricating oil, engine abrasion powder, etc.) in<br>
addition to the above-described PM which can be removed by a restoration operation.<br>
77<br><br>
When an accumulation state is monitored only by detecting a differential pressure using a<br>
pressure sensor, it is difficult to determine whether an increase in the differential pressure is<br>
caused by the above-described PM or by engine abrasion powder or the like. To achieve<br>
this determination, it is necessary to determine the necessity of maintenance, such as<br>
cleaning of the DPF or the like, based on the total run time of the engine.<br>
In contrast to this, according to the configuration of this embodiment, for example, when a<br>
differential pressure detected by the pressure sensor is relatively high and an electrical<br>
resistance value detected by the electrical resistance detecting sensor 36c is relatively low, it<br>
can be determined that the accumulation amount of PM which can be removed by a<br>
restoration operation is large. On the other hand, when a differential pressure detected by<br>
the pressure sensor is relatively high and an electrical resistance value detected on the filter<br>
by the electrical resistance detecting sensor 36c is relatively high, it can be determined that<br>
the accumulation amount of PM which cannot be removed by a restoration operation is<br>
large. Therefore, by using the maintenance determining means, it is easy to determine<br>
whether the filter can be cleaned by execution of a restoration operation or the maintenance<br>
of the DPF 33 is required.<br>
(Seventeenth embodiment)<br>
Next, a seventeenth embodiment will be described. In this embodiment, a filter restoration<br>
operating condition is previously determined based on a filter surface temperature upon the<br>
start of a restoration operation.<br>
Specifically, the filter surface temperature is measured at the same time when the PM<br>
accumulation amount is detected. A restoration operation is started after previously<br>
determining a restoration operation continuation time, a reduction in air intake amount, a<br>
heat level of the electric heater, and the like, as filter restoration operation conditions, based<br>
on a difference between the filter surface temperature upon the start of a restoration<br>
operation and the restoration target temperature. According to this, a filter restoration<br>
operation can be executed under appropriate conditions, thereby making it possible to<br>
78<br><br>
minimize and suppress a deterioration in fuel efficiency due to a restoration operation or the<br>
like.<br>
(Eighteenth embodiment)<br>
Next, an eighteenth embodiment will be described. In this embodiment, when a filter<br>
temperature upon the start of the engine is lower than or equal to a predetermined<br>
temperature, a filter restoration operation is forcedly forbidden.<br>
In the DPF 33, assuming that the filter temperature is lower than or equal to a<br>
predetermined temperature (cold state) upon the start of the engine, if a filter restoration<br>
operation, such as reduction of the air intake amount, changing of the fuel injection time or<br>
its pattern, or the like, is executed, CO or THC does not react with a catalyst due to<br>
incomplete combustion of air-fuel mixture, so that CO and THC are emitted, as they are, to<br>
the atmosphere, resulting in irritating odor. Therefore, in this embodiment, the filter<br>
restoration operation is forcedly forbidden during the cold state so as to suppress<br>
incomplete combustion of air-fuel mixture, thereby reducing the emission amount of CO<br>
and THC. Specifically, when the temperature of engine cooling water is lower than or<br>
equal to 50Â°C, a filter restoration operation is forbidden. When the engine cooling water<br>
temperature exceeds 50Â°C and the exhaust temperature increase control start condition is<br>
satisfied, a filter restoration operation is started.<br>
- Other embodiments -<br>
Although the engines comprising a single DPF 33 have been described in the embodiments<br>
and variations above, the present invention is applicable to an engine comprising a plurality<br>
of DPFs which are connected in parallel or in series.<br>
Also, although it has been mainly described in the embodiments above that the DPF 33 is<br>
restored by a reduction in air intake amount and heating by an electric heater, the DPF 33<br>
may be restored in other manners. For example, the opening degree of an exhaust<br>
79<br><br>
throttling valve provided in an exhaust system may be reduced, the fuel injection amount<br>
may be increased, or the fuel injection time may be delayed.<br>
Also, the present invention is not limited to the filter main body 35 the entire of which is<br>
made of a nonconductive material. Alternatively, substantially the whole filter 33 may be<br>
made of a conductive material, while only a portion of the surface of the primary flow path<br>
35c may be made of a nonconductive material so that an electrical resistance between two<br>
points in the portion made of the nonconductive material is detected.<br>
The present invention can be embodied and practiced in other different forms without<br>
departing from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof. Therefore, the<br>
above-described embodiments are considered in all respects as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by<br>
the foregoing description. All variations and modifications falling within the equivalency<br>
range of the appended claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>

February 28, 2005 and Patent Application No. 2005-129836 filed in Japan on April 27,<br>
2005, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. All documents cited<br>
herein are also specifically incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
