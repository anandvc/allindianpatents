The compounds of formula 1 and the compounds of formula 4 according to the invention can be prepared as follows.<br>
As shown in reaction scheme 1 the compounds of formula 1, wherein R1, R7, R8 and R9 have the above-mentioned meanings and n is 1 can be obtained by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 2 with a compound of formula R9-H, wherein R9 has the above-mentioned meanings in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example N.N-dimethylformamide, 1-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1 -propanol, butanol, acetonitril or tetrahydrofurane, preferably in the presence of a base, such as, for example potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or diisopropylethylamine and preferably at raised temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent being used.<br>
The compounds of formula 2, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be obtained by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 4 with chloroacetylchloride or chloroacetic anhydride in an inert solvent, such as, for example dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofurane or acetonitril, preferably in the presence of a base, such as, for example triethyJamine or diisopropylethylamine, preferably at a temperature between 0°C and ambient temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula 1, wherein R1, R7, R8 and R9 have the above-mentioned meanings and n is 2 can be obtained by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 3 with a compound of formula<br><br>
R9-H wherein R9 has the above-mentioned meanings in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example N,N-dimethylformamide, 1-methy1-pyrrolidin-2-one, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofurane, dichlorome-thane or toluene, preferably in the presence of an base, such as, for example potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, and preferably at raised temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent being used.<br>
The compounds of formula 3, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be prepared by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 4 with prop-2-enoyl chloride in an inert solvent, such as, for example dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitril or tetrahydrofurane, preferably in the presence of a base, such as, for example triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. The reaction is preferably carried out at ambient temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula 4, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be prepared by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 5 with an in 4-position activated and in 1-position protected piperdine-derivative, such as, for example tert-butyl 4-(toluene-4-sulfonyloxy)-piperidine-1-carboxylate or tert-butyl 4-(methanesulfonyloxy)-piperidine-1-carboxylate in an inert solvent, such as, for example N.N-dfrnethylformamide, 1-methyt-pyrrolidin-2-one or dioxane, in the presence of a strong base, such as, for example sodium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium hydride, and preferably at raised temperature, such as, for example 80 to 150°C.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula 4, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be prepared by reacting a corresponding compound of formula 6 with ptperidin-4-ylhydrazine dihydrochloride in a methanol/water solvent system, preferably at raised temperatures, especially at the boiling point of the solvent system being used.<br>
The compounds of formula 5, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be obtained by reacting an appropriately substituted a.a-disubstituted-p-oxobenzene propionic acid ester of formula 6 with hydrazine hydrate in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example an alcohol like ethanol or methanol, preferably at raised temperature, especially at the boiling point of the solvent being used. The ester of the a, a-disubstituted-p-oxobenzene propionic acid ester may be a 1-4C-alkyl ester; particularly preferred is - as shown in reaction scheme 1 - the methyl ester.<br>
The compounds of formula 6, wherein R1, R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings can be prepared by reacting an activated benzoic acid derivative of formula 8, wherein R1 has the above-mentioned meanings with an ester of formula 7, wherein R7 and R8 have the above-mentioned meanings, in an inert solvent, such as, for example tetrahydrofurane, diethyl ether, toluene, N,N-dimethyl-formamide or 1-methyl-pvrrolidin-2-one, in the presence of a strong base, such as for example lithium diisopropylamine, butyl lithium or sodium hydride, at low temperatures, preferably below -40°C.<br><br>
Suitable esters of formula 7 are for example methyl 2-methylproponate, methyl-2-methylbutanoate, methyl-2-ethyibutanoate, methyl 2-methylpentanoate and methyl cyclopentancarboxylate.<br>
The esters of formula 7 are commercially available or can be prepared according to procedures known in the art.<br>
The activated benzoic acid derivatives of formula 8 can be obtained, for example, according to the procedures described in the international patent applications W092/12961, WO94/02465, WO95/01338 and WO96/03399.<br>
An alternative synthesis route to compounds of formula 5 is described in the European patent application EP0126651.<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula 1 can be converted into further compounds of formula 1 by methods known in the art. For example<br>
• a compound of formula 1, wherein R9 is a thiomorpholine-1-oxide-3,5-dione-4-yl- or a thio-morphoIine-1,1-dioxide-3,5-dione-4-yl-ring can be prepared from a compound of formula 1, wherein R9 is a thiomorpholine-3,5-dione-4-yl-ring by an oxidation reaction, for example by using 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in dichloromethane as an oxidant.<br>
A further possibility to prepare compounds of formula 1 is to use a temporarily protective group in order to introduce a specific substituent at the end of a reaction sequence. This method can be advantageously used, for example, to introduce different alkoxy groups in the position of the R3 substituent. Examples 5, 6 and 7 have been prepared using such a method; here, the benzyl group served as a temporarily protective group for a hydroxyl group in R3 position.<br>
It is known to the person skilled in the art that, if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound, it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporan'fy by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, 3rd Ed., or in P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on a suitable support material.<br>
Salts of the compounds of formula 4 and the stereoisomers thereof can be obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone such as acetone, methylethylketone or methylisobutylketone, an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or chloroform, a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, a low molecular weight aliphatic ester such as ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate, or water) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base (S then added. The add or base can be employed in salt preparation, depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid or base is concerned and depending on which salt is desired, in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non-solvent for the salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, which can be obtained, for example, as process products in the manufacturing on<br><br>
an industrial scale, can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds according to the invention can be obtained e.g. by asymmetric synthesis, by using chiral starting compounds in synthesis and by splitting up enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures obtained in synthesis. Preferably, the pure diastereomeric and pure enantiomeric compounds of the invention are obtained by using chiral starting compounds in synthesis.<br>
Enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures can be split up into the pure enantiomers and pure diastereomers by methods known to a person skilled in the art. Preferably, diastereomeric mixtures are separated by crystallization, in particular fractional crystallization, or chromatography. Enantiomeric mixtures can be separated e.g. by forming diastereomers with a chiral auxiliary agent, resolving the diastereomers obtained and removing the chiral auxiliary agent. As chiral auxiliary agents, for example, chiral acids can be used to separate enantiomeric bases and chiral bases can be used to separate enantiomeric acids via formation of diastereomeric salts. Furthermore, diastereomeric derivatives such as dfastereomeric esters can be formed from enantiomeric mixtures of alcohols or enantiomeric mixtures of acids, respectively, using chiral acids or chiral alcohols, respectively, as chiral auxiliary agents. Additionally, diastereomeric complexes or diastereomeric clathrates may be used for separating enantiomeric mixtures. Alternatively, enantiomeric mixtures can be split up using chiral separating columns in chromatography. Another suitable method for the isolation of enantiomers is the enzymatic separation.<br>

Biological investigations<br>
The second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) is well-known for inhibiting inflammatory and immunocompetent cells. The PDE4 isoenzyme is broadly expressed in cells involved in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory diseases (H Tenor and C Schudt, in ..Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 21-40, „The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996), and its inhibition leads to an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration and thus to the inhibition of cellular activation (JE Souness et al., Immunopharmacology 47:127-162, 2000).<br>
The antiinflammatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors in vivo in various animal models has been described {MM Teixeira, TiPS 18:164-170,1997). For the investigation of PDE4 inhibition on the cellular level (in vitro), a large variety of proinflammatory responses can be measured. Examples are the superoxide production of neutrophilic (C Schudt et al., Arch Pharmacol 344: 682-690,1991) or eosinophilic (A Hatzelmann et al., Brit J Pharmacol 114: 821-831, 1995) granulocytes, which can be measured as lu-minol-enhanced chemiiuminescence, or the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-ct in monocytes, macrophages or dendritic cells (Gantneretal., Brit J Pharmacol 121: 221-231,1997, and Pulmonary Pharma-cof Tnerap 12: 377-386, 1999). fn addition, the immunomodulatory potential of PDE4 inhibitors is evident from the inhibition of T-cell responses like cytokine synthesis or proliferation (DM Essayan, Bio-chem Pharmacol 57: 965-973,1999). Substances which inhibit the secretion of the afore-mentioned proinflammatory mediators are those which inhibit PDE4. PDE4 inhibition by the compounds according to the invention is thus a central indicator for the suppression of inflammatory processes.<br><br>
Method for measuring inhibition of PDE4 activity<br>
The PDE4B1 (GB no. L20966) was a gift of Prof. M. Conti (Stanford University, USA). It was amplified from the original plasmid (pCMV5) via PCR with primers Rb18 (5'- CAGACATCCTAAGAGGGGAT -3') and Rb10 (5'- AGAGGGGGATTATGTATCCAC -3') and cloned into the pCR-Bac vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, NL).<br>
The recombinant baculovirus was prepared by means of homologous recombination in SF9 insect cells. The expression plasmids were cotransfected with Baculo-Gold DNA (Pharmingen, Hamburg) using a standard protocol (Pharmingen, Hamburg). Wt virus-free recombinant virus supematants were selected using plaque assay methods. After that, high-titre virus supematants were prepared by amplifying 3 times. PDE4B1 was expressed in SF21 cells by infecting 2 x 106 cells/ml with an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 1 and 10 in the serum-free medium Insect Express Sf9-S2 (PAA, Pasching, Austria). The cells were cultured at 28°C for 48 - 72 hours, after which they were pelleted for 5-10 min at 1000xg and 4°C.<br>
The SF21 insect cells were resuspended, at a concentration of approx. 107 cells/ml, in ice-cold (4°C) homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.2, containing the following additions: 140 mM NaCI, 3.8 mM KCI, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCI2,10 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM Pefablock, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 5 μM trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The ho-mogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000xg and the supernatant was stored at -80°C until subsequent use (see below). The protein content was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad, Munich) using BSA as the standard.<br>
PDE4B1 activity was inhibited by the compounds according to the invention in a modified SPA (scintillation proximity assay) test, supplied by Amersham Biosciences (see procedural instructions "phosphodiesterase [3H]cAMP SPA enzyme assay, code TRKQ 7090"), carried out in 96-well microtitre plates (MTP's). The test volume is 100 nl and contains 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg /ml of BSA, 5 mM Mg2+, 0.5 jiM cAMP (including about 50,000 cpm of [3HJcAMP), 1 \i\ of the respective substance dilution in DMSO and sufficient recombinant PDE (1000xg supernatant, see above) to ensure that 10-20% of the cAMP is converted under the said experimental conditions. The final concentration of DMSO in the assays (1 % v/v) does not substantially affect the activity of the PDE investigated. After a preincubation of 5 min at 37qC, the reaction is started by adding the substrate (cAMP) and the assays are incubated for a further 15 min; after that, they are stopped by adding SPA beads (50 JJ.I&gt;. In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the SPA beads had previously been resuspended in water, but were then diluted 1:3 (v/v) in water; the diluted solution also contains 3 mM IBMX to ensure a complete PDE activity stop. After the beads have been sedimented (&gt; 30 min), the MTP's are analyzed in commercially available luminescence detection devices. The corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for the<br><br>
inhibition of PDE4B1 activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of nonlinear regression.<br>
The inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention follow from the following Table 1, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples.<br><br><br>
