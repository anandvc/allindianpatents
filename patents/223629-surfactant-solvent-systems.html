Description<br>
Surfactant/sotvent systems<br>
The invention relates to the field of combinations of surfactants and solvents (surfactant/solvent systems) for liquid formulations of active substances (also referred to as liquid preparations), in particular of agrochemical active substances. The invention preferably relates to surfactant/solvent systems for one-phase formulations of one or more agrochemical active substances, where at least one of the active substances, preferably each active substance, is not readily soluble in water. In particular, the invention relates to emulsifiable concentrates (EC) which are based on organic solvents and agrochemical active substances of different polarity. Formulations in the form of oil-based emulsions or suspension concentrates are also possible, and preference is given to emulsifiable concentrates which comprise one or more agrochemical active substances from the group of the herbicides. Insecticides, ungicides, acaricides, molluskicides, rodenticides and/or timber preservatives, preferred in this context are, inter alia, beet herbicides such as desmedipham, phenmedipham, ethofumesate, metamitron and herbicides which are of a similar type with regard to their physical and application properties, for example herbicides rom the series of the phenoxyphenoxypropionates or of the leteroaryloxyphenoxyproplonates.<br>
 general, active substances are employed not as pure materials, but, depending on be field of application and the desired physical composition of the use form, in ombination with certain adjuvants, i.e. they are "formulated". Frequently, such prmulations contain combinations of various active substances instead of individual ctive substances to make use, upon application, of the joint properties of the dividual active substances, or else because Individual active substances are<br><br>
synergistic in combination, i.e. their action is enhanced in a superadditive fashion.<br>
Independently of the type of formulation and of whether the formulations comprise one or more active substances, the aim in particular in the agricultural sector is to achieve the highest possible active substance concentration ("load") of the formulation in question, since a high concentration of the active substances penriits the application volumes to be reduced, which, as a consequence, saves material with regard to the adjuvants applied and saves costs in the packaging and transport sector.<br>
Highly concentrated stable formulations and coformulations with environmentally friendly adjuvants are therefore interesting as a matter of principle.<br>
In principle, active substances can be formulated in various ways, depending on the biological and/or chemico-physical parameters specified. In general, examples of suitable formulations which are possible are wettable powders (WP), oil-in-water (OA/V) or water-in-oil (W/0) emulsions, suspensions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), or else granules for soil application or spreading, or water-dispersible granules (WG). The abovementioned formulation types are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Engineering], Volume 7, C.Hauser-Veriag, Munich, 4" Edition 1986; van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel-Dekker N.Y., 1973; K.Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed., 1979, G.Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
Liquid formulations of herbicides are already known. Thus, for example, WO-A-85/01286 describes liquid formulations which comprise phenmedipham and/or metamitron. Solvents which are mentioned in this context are esters of polyalcohols, ethers, ketones, water-insoluble alcohols, (poly)glycois and oils of vegetable, but also of mineral, origin, and suitable emulsifiers mentioned only in general for the above-described liquid formulations are nonionic, but also ampholytic, cationic or anionic surfactants.<br>
Suitable    alternatives    to    solvent-based    emulsifiable    concentrates    for    the<br><br>
abovementioned active substances are Inter alia water-containing suspension concentrates (SC) or suspoemulsions (SE). Such formulations are described, for example, in EP-A 0514769 , WO-A-95/23505, EP-A-0637910 and WO-A-92/09195.<br>
FR-A-2597720, FR-A-2599593 and FR-A-904874 describe emulsifiable concentrates which - In deviation from the publications cited above - together with (at least) one herbicide of the biscarbamate type (in particular phenmedlpham or desmedipham) comprise a solvent combination of tributyl phosphate and a solvent which is miscible with water, such as, in particular, N-methylpyrrolldone (NMP).<br>
Furthermore, EP-A-0328217 describes emulsifiable concentrates which comprise ethofumesate and, as solvent, tributyl phosphate. The disadvantage in the last-mentioned type of formulation is the use of tributyl phosphate because it is considered to be a dangerous chemical (cf., for example, Chemikaliengesetz [German Chemicals Act]). While this does not make impossible, or ban, the use of tributyl phosphate, the use entails, as a rule, conditions or is generally problematic.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that the bioiogical activity of some pesticidal active substances can be enhanced in some cases by low-molecular weight organic compounds. Thus, in accordance with BE-A-597284, esters or partial esters based on orthophosphoric acid and alkyl-, aryl-, alkylaryl-, cycloalkylaryl- and/or heterocycle-based alcohols are suitable for increasing the action of herbicides, for 3xample herbicidal phenylurea derivatives such as monuron, azoles such as amitrol, riazines such as simazine and propionic acid derivatives such as dalapon. The Phosphoric esters specifically described in this context as adjuvants only encompass Phosphoric esters which are relatively unpolar or fully soluble in water and which are lot suitable for the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates.<br>
DE-A-2914164 describes synergistic effects which are found in the case of lerbicides with a desiccant action on crop plants, i.e. for example herbicides from be group of the phenylureas (for example metoxuron, diuron) or triazines (for xample atrazine,  simazine), when they are combined with  phosphorus-based<br><br>
compositions as are employed in industrial metallurgy for obtaining metals or as plasticizers for polymers. It can be seen unambiguously from the publication that these phosphorus-based compositions, which can be employed for example in industrial metallurgy for obtaining metals or as plasticizers in polymers, are employed as active substances in this context and not as solvents. In other words, this means that the phosphoric acid derivatives In this publication are active substances and not solvents or carriers for agrochemlcal active substances in the traditional sense. It can also be seen from Japanese Patent Specification JA 29878/69 that, for example, tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) Is described as active substance, but not as solvent.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain surfactant/solvent systems are suitable in a particular manner for use In the preparation of liquid formulations such as oil dispersions, suspoemulsions, W/0- or OA/V-based emulsions and, in particular, of emutsiflable concentrates and con'esponding aqueous spray mixtures derived therefrom.<br>

i)       as solvent, one or more triester(s) of phosphoric acid with alcohols, preferably from the group consisting of<br>

The solvent component [component (fi)] of the surfactant/solvent system according to the invention are fully reacted, unhydrolyzed esters, i.e. triesters, of phosphoric acid, in particular ortho-phosphoric acid with alcohols which are insoluble in water or are soluble in water up to a maximum concentration of 10 g/l. Compounds which are especially preferably suitable as component (ft) are those having alkylene oxide<br>
units, for example (Ci-C4)alkylene  oxide  units,  e.g.  tri{butoxyethyi) phosphate<br>
(TBEP). Preferred as alkylene oxide units are (Ci-C4)alkylene oxide units, for<br>
example ethyleneoxy, propyleneoxy and/or butyleneoxy units, in particular propyleneoxy and/or ethyleneoxy units, which are preferably located in the alcohol component of the phosphoric ester. Prefened components (p) have 1-4 alkylene<br>
oxide units, preferably 1-4 (Ci-C4)alkylene oxide units, per alcohol unit. The molecular weight of component (p) is preferably less than 1000. The compounds of component (p) preferably share the feature that they do not form micellar aggregates in aqueous solutions, for example micellar aggregates which can be detected by light scattering measurements or other methods. This additionally distinguishes them<br><br>
from the phosphoric ester surfactants.<br>
Examples of suitable components (p) are the triesters of phosphoric acid such as orthophosphoric acid which has been formally reacted three times with alcohols, and the oxalkylates of phosphoric acid such as orthophosphoric acid which has been formally reacted once and/or twice with alcohols. Examples of suitable compounds (p) are triesters of phosphoric acid with alcohols from the group consisting of<br>
1)	monohydric alkanols having 5 to 22 carbon atoms, for example n-, i- or neo-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, 2-ethylhexanoI,<br>
2)	diols or polyols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol.<br>
3)	aryi, alkylaryl, poly(alkyl)aryl and poly{arylalkyi)aryl alcohols, for example phenol and/or cresol, octylphenol, nonylphenol, thisobutylphenol, tristyryiphenol,<br>
4)	alkoxylated alcohols obtained by reacting the alcohols mentioned above under<br>
1), 2) or 3) with alkylene oxides, preferably 1-4 units of (Ci-C4)alkylene oxides,<br>
and<br>
5)	alkoxylated alcohols obtained by reacting monohydric alkanols having 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms and alkylene oxides, preferably 1-4 units of (Ci-C4)alkylene<br>
oxides, which esters are insoluble in water or are soluble in water up to a maximum concentration of 10 g/1.<br>
Preferred phosphoric esters (component p) are, for example,<br>
-	alkoxylated short-chain alcohols having 1-22 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and 1 to 30, preferably 1-4 alkylene oxide units in the polyalkylene oxide moiety which have been reacted completely with ortho-phosphonc acid, for example tri(butoxyethyl) phosphate,<br>
-	alkyl alcohols having 5 -22 carbon atoms which have been reacted completely with ortho-phosphoric acid, for example Hostaphat CG 120® (Clanant), tri-n-octyi phosphate ("TOF", Bayer), and<br>
-	optionally alkoxylated alcohols having 1-22 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and phenol derivatives which have been partially reacted with ortho-phosphoric acid,<br><br>
in each case with 0 to 30, preferably 0-4 alkylene oxide units in the polyalltylene oxide moiety, the remaining OH valencies of the ortho-phosphoric acid subsequently having been alkoxylated, for example the reaction product of mono/dibutoxyethy! phosphate and 2 mol of ethylene oxide or 2 mol of propylene oxide.<br>
Surprisingly, the surfactant/solvent system according to the invention allows stable active substance formulations to be prepared, for example formulations of active substances, in particular agrochemical, for example herbicidal, active substances which are insoluble in water or soluble in water up to a maximum concentration of 10 g/1. Examples of such active substance formulations are visually transparent and thermodynamjcally stable emulsiflable concentrates, thermodynamically unstable O/W and W/0 emulsions, suspoemulsions or suspension concentrates, inter alia of agrochemical, preferably herbicidal, active substances such as biscarbamate herbicides (for example desmedipham and/or phenmedipham), and/or sulfonate herbicides (for example ethofumesate) and/or triazinone herbicides (for example metamitron). In addition, the surfactant system according to the invention may have a favorable effect on the pesticidal action of the agrochemical active substance(s) incorporated.<br>
Also, the surfactant/solvent system according to the invention permits the preparation of formulations with active substances other than those mentioned above as long as they have similar properties with regard to their solubility. For example, others which are suitable are herbicides from the group of the phenoxyphenoxypropionates such as diclofop-methyl, of the heteroaryloxyphenoxy-propionates such as fenoxaprop-ethyl or dodinafop-propargyl, of the triazinones, such as metamitron, of the sulfonylureas, such as triflusulfuron-methyl, or other active substances such as prochloraz and/or insecticides such as deltamethrin. This shows the flexibility of the surfactant/solvent system described. The compounds Tientioned are known to the skilled worker for example from "The Pesticide Manual",<br>
British Crop Protection Council, 11    edition, 1997.<br><br>
other organic solvents (c) which are suitable are, for example, unpolar solvents, polar protic or aprotic dipolar solvents and their mixtures. Examples of other organic solvents for the purposes of the invention are<br>
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, mineral oils, paraffins  or toluene,  xylenes  and  naphthalene  derivatives,  in  particular<br>
1-methylnaphthatene,  2-methylnaphthalene,  mixtures  of Ce-Cie-aromatics<br>
such as, for example, the Solvesso® series (ESSO) with the types Solvesso® 100 (b.p. 162-177°C), Solvesso® 150 (b.p. 187-207X) and Solvesso® 200 (b.p. 219-282'C) and 6-20C atiphatics which can be linear or cyclic, such as<br>
the products of the Shellsol® series, types T and K, or BP-n paraffins,<br>
halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or<br>
chlorobenzene,<br>
mono- and/or polybasic esters such as, for example, triacetin {acetic acid<br>
triglyceride),    butyrolactone,    propylene   cartonate,    triethyl   citrate   and<br>
(Ci-C22)alM phthalates, specifically (C4-C8)alkyl phthatates,<br>
ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, alkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers and alkylene glycol dialkyl ethers such as, for example,<br>
propylene glycol monomethyl ether, specifically Dowanol® PM (propylene glycol monomethyl ether), propylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diglyme and tetraglyme,<br>
amides     such     as     dimethylformamide     (DMF),     dimethylacetamide, dimethytcapryiic/capric amide and N-alkylpyrrolidones, ketones such as acetone, which is water-soluble, but also ketones which are not miscible with water, such as, for example, cyclohexanone or isophorone, nitriles such as acetonltrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and benzonitrile, sulfoxides and sulfones such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfolane, and<br>
oils in general, for example vegetable oils such as corn oil and rapeseed oil.<br>
Further preferred organic solvents for the purposes of the present invention are, in<br><br>
particular, amides such as dimethyl caprylic/capric amide and N-m ethyl pyrrol idone, or<br>
® aromatic solvents such as the Solvesso   series from Exxon.<br>
The adjuvants and additives used for the preparation of the abovementioned formulations, such as, in particular, surfactants and solvents, are known In principle, and are described, for example, in standard works: McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface active Agents", Chem. Publ.Co.Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzfleichenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Vertagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-KUchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Engineeering], Volume 7, C.Hauser-Verlag, Munich, 4" edition, 1986.<br>
While the chemical structure of the individual components which can be employed is described in sufficient detail in the abovementioned standard works, predictions regarding the properties of mixtures of such components for formulating active substances cannot be deduced from the abovementioned standard works.<br>
Surprisingly, It has now been found that combinations of a phosphoric triester which is insoluble in water or soluble in water up to a maximum concentration of 10 g/l as solvent and one or more nonaromatic-based surfactants are particularly well suited for the preparation of liquid active substance formulations such as stable emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspoemulsions or suspension concentrates, which are likewise subject matter of the invention.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention can be prepared by the customary processes which are already known, for example by mixing the various components with the aid of stirring, shaking or (static) mixers. If appropriate, it is advantageous to briefly heat the samples in order to ensure the complete dissolution of all the components involved.<br><br>
One factor for the selection of preferred surfactant components is their acidity or basicity per unit weight or volume, which is expressed, for example, by the acid number or amine number. When selecting further surfactant components, it Is advantageous to ensure that the total acid number or amine number does not increase unduly. Preferably suitable, besides nonionic surfactants, are therefore for example acidic or basic surfactant components with sufficiently small acid or amine numbers, or nonionic surfactant components. Accordingly, additional nonionic surfactant components which can be employed are, for example, castor oil which has been reacted with 40 mol of EG or else castor oil which has been reacted with 12 mol of EO, oleic acid which has been reacted with 15 mol of EG, and EG/ PO/EO block copolymers.<br>
In this connection it must furthermore be mentioned that the surfactant/solvent systems according to the invention allow the preparation of stable formulations with an active substance load and active substance composition which can be varied within wide limits. Thus, the active substance load may vary for example between 20 and 40, preferably between 24 and 30, percent by weight. As regards the active substance composition, not only stable formulations with one active substance, but also formulations with two or, in particular, three active substances, can be obtained using this component mixture.<br>
The above-described surfactant/solvent systems are preferably suitable for the preparation of formulations with herbicldal active substances such as diclofop-methyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl, prochloraz, metamltron and/or deltamethrin.<br>
Prefened ratios of the components phosphoric ester (P):surfactant (a) are, in particular, 100:1 to 1:100, especially preferably 1:5 to 1:20, for example approximately 1:8, 1:9 or 1:10, or 1:0.,25 to 1;0.,9, for example 1.3:1, 1.4:1 or 1.5:1, depending on the active substance load and the active substance composition of the formulations.<br>
The surfactant/solvent system according to the invention permits the preparation of<br><br>
various liquid formulations, such as oil dispersions, suspoemulsions. W/0- or OAA/-based emulsions and, in particular, of emulsifiable concentrates and corresponding liquid formulations derived therefrom, such as aqueous spray mixtures.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates which are prepared in accordance with the present invention comprise a priori no added water, but only the residual water present In the abovementioned commercially available surfactants and surfactant mixtures, polymers and solvents. Owing to the surfactants present in the emulsflable concentrates according to the Invention, however, it is possible for these to be diluted with water as far as a critical volume fraction without this leading to cloudiness or the forrnulation becoming unstable. Formally, this first gives rise to W/0 microemulsions which, upon further increasing the water fraction, become W/0 emulsions and finally - upon further dilution with water - O/W emulsions. The invention therefore also encompasses liquid formulations which, besides the surfactant/solvent mixture b) according to the invention, comprise (added) water, for example microemulsions.<br>
The component mixtures (b) allow preferably liquid preparations of active substances, in particular herbicidal active substances such as desmedipham and/or phenmedipham and/or ethofumesate, to be prepared, which comprise<br>
a)	1 to 50% by weight, preferably 15 to 35% by weight, of agrochemical active substances,<br>
b)	5 to 80% by weight, preferably 10 to 70% by weight, of the surfactant/solvent system (b) according to the invention,<br>
c)	0 to 40% by weight, preferably 5 to 35% by weight, of further organic solvents,<br>
d)	0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0 to 10% by weight, of customary adjiuvants and additives, such as formulation auxiliaries, and<br>
e)	0 to 96% by weight, preferably 0 to 90% by weight, in particular 0 to 10% by weight, of water.<br>
Examples of customary adjiuvants and additives such as formulation auxiliaries d) are antifreeze agents, evaporation Inhibitors, preservatives, odorants and colorants.<br><br>
Preferred formulation auxiliaries d) are antifreeze agents and evaporation inhibitors such as glycerol, for example in an amount of 2 to 10% by weight, and preservatives, for example Mergal K9N® (Riedel) or Cobate C® in the use concentrations which are customary for the agents employed in each case.<br>
Since anhydrous emulsfiable concentrates constitute an advantageous use form of the active substances, in particular herbicidal active substances of type (a), an especially preferred subject matter of the invention are emulsifiable concentrates which comprise<br>
a)	10 to 40% by weight of active substances of the abovementioned type (a),<br>
b)	10 to 60% by weight of the surfactant/solvent system (b) according to the invention,<br>
c)	5 to 35% by weight of further organic solvents and<br>
d)	0 to 10% by weight of customary adjuvants and additives, for example formulation auxiliaries.<br>
In analogy to anhydrous emulsfiable concentrates, the oil-based suspension concentrates, which are likewise anhydrous, constitute a preferred subject matter of this invention, these preparations comprising<br>
a)	10 to 40% by weight of active substances of the abovementioned type (a),<br>
b)	10 to 60% by weight of the surfactant/solvent system (b) according to the invention,<br>
c)	5 to 35% by weight of further organic solvents,<br>
d)	0 to 10% by weight of customary adjuvants and additives other than (e), such as formulation auxiliaries, and<br>
e)	0.001 to 20% by weight of organic and/or inorganic thickeners.<br>
Furthermore, emulsions may also be prepared with the surfactant/solvent systems according to the invention. A further especially preferred subject matter of the invention are therefore emulsions or microemulsions comprising a)       10 to 40% by weight of active substances of the abovementioned type (a),<br><br>
b)	10 to 60% by weight of the surfactant/solvent system (b) according to the invention,<br>
c)	5 to 35% by weight of further organic solvents and<br>
d)	0 to 10% by weight of customary adjuvants and additives, such as formulation auxiliaries and<br>
e)	0.001 to 95% by weight of water.<br>
The suspoemulsions which can be prepared with the above-described surfactant/solvent systems also constitute a preferred subject matter of the invention. These comprise<br>
a)	10 to 40% by weight of active substances of the abovementioned type (a),<br>
b)	10 to 60% by weight of the surfactant/solvent system (b) according to the invention,<br>
c)	5 to 35% by weight of further organic solvents and<br>
d)	0 to 10% by weight of customary adjuvants and additives other than (f), such as formulation auxiliaries and<br>
e)	0.001 to 95% by weight of water and<br>
f)	0.001 to 20% by weight of organic and/or inorganic thickeners.<br>
Upon dilution with water, the surfactant/solvent system according to the invention {component mixture b)) results in dispersions of oil phases In water or, when the appropriate individual components have been chosen, of aqueous phases In oil. Accordingly, dispersions can be obtained which can be diluted with water or with oil while retaining the colloidal structure, depending on the composition. The dispersions which can be obtained from the above-described concentrates by dilution are therefore another subject matter of the Invention.<br>
The surfactant/solvent system according to the invention is suitable for the preparation of stable liquid formulations, in particular emulslflable concentrates. The formulations and spray mixtures which can be prepared with the surfactant/solvent system according to the Invention also give results which are advantageous from the biological angle upon use. An effective amount of the formulation or of the spray<br><br>
mixture, if necessary after dilution with water, is applied to the plants, plant parts or the area on which the plants grow, for example the area under cultivation. Moreover, the biological activity of the agrochemical active substances employed can be increased synergistically by employing surfactant/solvent component b) according to the invention.<br>
