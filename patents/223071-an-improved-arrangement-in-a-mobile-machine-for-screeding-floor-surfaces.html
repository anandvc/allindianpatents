				<td>An Improved Arrangement in a mobile machine for screeding floor surfaces<br>
The present invention relates to an improved arrangement in a mobile machine for<br>
screeding floor surfaces.<br>
Reference is made to US 5637032 A, US 1069803 A, US 4097950 A, FR2073627 A5, and<br>
FR 11 08781 A as examples of the prior art.<br>
US 4 097 950 discloses a device for scrubbing surfaces having pairs of freely rotatable<br>
brushes each mounted on a shaft having an offset tip portion. Each shaft is mounted on a<br>
rotating support plate and half of the shafts rotate clockwise and the other half rotate<br>
counter-clockwise. In the preferred embodiment, the scrubbers have slanted bristles which<br>
bias the rotation of each scrubber in the direction of rotation of the shaft it is mounted upon.<br>
US 5 637 032 relates to an arrangement for a mobile surfacing machine, preferably for the<br>
surfacing of stone floors. A frame supports a drive motor with a motor shaft. A planet disc is<br>
rotatably mounted in the frame, with three surfacing discs arranged on shafts rotatably<br>
mounted on the planet disc. The surfacing discs are in operative connection with a belt<br>
pulley arranged on the drive shaft of the motor via a drive belt running around first belt<br>
pulleys arranged on the aforementioned shafts. The shafts of the surfacing discs are so<br>
arranged, for the purpose of controlling the rotation of the planet disc, as to be in operative<br>
connection with the frame. The operative connection comprises, for example, a belt pulley<br>
attached to the frame, second belt pulleys arranged on the shafts of the surfacing discs, and<br>
a second belt running around these and the belt pulley attached to the frame.<br>
Screeding machines of the aforementioned type function inherently well, but as the material<br>
in the screeding discs used to machine the floor surfaces is progressively developed,<br>
thereby enabling it to remove more floor material per unit time than before, there is a desire<br>
for more available power for machining of the floor material.<br>
The object of the present invention is to produce an arrangement in a screeding machine of<br>
the type referred to in the introductory part, which has an improved removal capability<br>
compared to known screeding machines.<br>
The present invention provides an improved arrangement in a mobile machine for screeding<br>
floor surfaces comprising a housing with a planet disk, which is rotatably supported in the<br>
bottom of the said housing and driven by a drive motor, -and which carries an even number<br>
of up to six but not less than four screeding disks, operatively connected to the drive motor<br>
and defining one screeding plane, characterized in that the operative connection comprises,<br>
on the one hand, belt sheaves belonging to the screeding disks, over which sheaves and<br>
over deflection sheaves arranged between the belt sheaves a belt runs in such a way that<br>
the belt bears against a part of the circumference of the belt sheaves, which alternating from<br>
belt sheave to belt sheave lies alternately closest to the centre of the planet disk and furthest<br>
away from the said centre, and on the other hand, a belt, which runs between a belt sheave<br>
arranged on the shaft of the motor and one of the belt sheaves belonging to the screeding<br>
disks.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an improved arrangement in a mobile machine for screeding<br>
floor surfaces comprising a housing with a planet disk, which is rotatably supported in the<br>
bottom of the said housing and which carries a number of rotatably supported screeding<br>
disks, distributed over said planet disk and operatively connected to a drive motor, and<br>
defining one screeding plane, is characterised in that the planet disk is operatively<br>
connected to a second drive motor, intended solely for driving the planet disk ; the number of<br>
screeding disks constitutes an even number up to a maximum of six ; and viewed in the<br>
direction of rotation of the planet disk, half the number of screeding disks have a direction of<br>
rotation coinciding with the planet disk and the remaining screeding disks have an opposing<br>
direction of rotation.<br>
The arrangement according to the invention furthermore has one or more of the<br>
characteristic features specified hereinafter.<br>
The invention moreover affords the following advantages :<br>
The screeding machine designed according to the invention has an improved balance and<br>
reduced lateral rotation, which especially in the case of a manually operated machine makes<br>
it easier to hold and control. More even screeding is achieved ; with known machines it is<br>
easy to end up with a machining mark having a plate-shaped cross-section, which means<br>
that it is necessary to screed with a relatively large overlap, in order to obtain a plane finish.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which fig. 1a, in an oblique, perspective view from beneath, shows by way of<br>
example a screeding unit in a screeding machine according to the invention, having a drive<br>
motor and a dished planet disk, which accommodates a belt transmission. Fig. 1b shows the<br>
drive motor and the planet disk in fig. 1a in an oblique perspective view from above. Fig. 1c<br>
shows essentially the same view as fig. 1a, but the planet disk and the belt transmission are<br>
covered by a cover plate with openings for the machine's screeding disks. Fig. 2, by way of<br>
an example, shows a plan view of a system of belts for driving the screeding machine planet<br>
disk and screeding disks of the type used in the embodiment according to figures la, 1b. Fig. 3 in a side view<br>
illustrates an embodiment of a screeding unit according to the invention, in which the screeding unit planet<br>
disk is driven by a separate drive motor.<br>
In figures la, lb, 1 denotes a drive motor mounted on a motor plate 2. The motor plate 2 is designed to be<br>
fitted in a screeding machine casing, not shown further, by means of a screw nut connection.<br>
3 denotes a planet disk, which is supported so that it can rotate in relation to the motor plate 2 and is shaped<br>
like a dish open at the bottom. When the screeding unit is ready for use the dish is covered by a protective<br>
plate having openings for the screeding disks. The dish with the protective plate forms a protected space for<br>
the drive mechanism, as will be explained below. This space accomodates four symmetrically located holders<br>
4al-4a4 for screeding disks 4cl-4c4, the holders being supported so that they can rotate, in the planet disk 3.<br>
For the sake of clarity, the screeding disks have been omitted from fig. la but are shown in fig. lc, in which<br>
the directions of rotation, according to the invention, of the screeding disks 4cl-4c4 and the planet disk 3 are<br>
also illustrated by arrows 3p and 4p respectively. 3a denotes a plate having openings for the screeding disks<br>
4cl-4c4, designed to protect the belt transmissions in the dished planet disk 3. A belt sheave 4bl-4b4 is<br>
connected to each holder 4al-4a4 for driving each screeding disk in the manner characteristic of the<br>
invention. A belt 6 runs over the belt sheaves 4bl-4b4 and over deflection sheaves 5 arranged between them.<br>
A belt sheave 1 a arranged on the shaft of the motor 1 is designed to drive the belt sheave 4b2 by way of a belt<br>
7, thereby causing the other belt sheaves to rotate. Since the belt 6 runs over that section of the circumference<br>
situated nearest to the centre of the planet disk 3 in respect of the belt sheaves 4bl and 4b3 and over the<br>
section of the circumference situated furthest away from the said centre in respect of the belt sheaves 4b2 and<br>
4b4, the belt sheaves 4bl, 4b3 assume opposing directions of rotation relative to the belt sheaves 4b2, 4b4,<br>
thereby providing the characteristic feature of the present invention, namely that adjacent screeding disks<br>
have opposite directions of rotation.<br>
From fig. lb it can be seen that shafts of the belt sheaves 4bl, 4b3 (connected to the respective<br>
screeding disks 4cl, 4c3) protrude from the dished planet disk 3 and form belt sheaves 8. 9 denotes a<br>
belt sheave fixed to the motor plate 2. A belt 10, by means of which the rotation of the motor 1 is<br>
transmitted to the planet disk 3 by way of the belt sheave la, the belt 7, the belt sheave 4a2, the belt 6 and<br>
the belt sheaves 4b 1, 4b3, runs over the belt sheaves 8 and 9. It may be noted in this connection that<br>
the planet disk 3 has the same direction of rotation as the screeding disks 4c2, 4c4. From this it<br>
follows that these screeding disks in an area furthest away from the centre of the planet disk 3 have a<br>
higher peripheral speed in relation to a surface that is to be screeded than do the screeding disks 4c 1,<br>
4c3 in the same area. If so required, this can, as the person skilled in the art will appreciate, be<br>
compensated for by giving the belt sheaves 4b 1, 4b3 and 4b2, 4b4 correspondingly different<br>
diamters. For the sake of clarity all belts and belt sheaves are drawn in fig. 2.<br>
The person skilled in the art will also appreciate that some or all of the belt transmissions may be<br>
replaced by gear transmissions or transmissions having a frictional engagement.<br>
It will also be appreciated that, without departing from the idea of the invention, six screeding disks<br>
supported by holders may be arranged on the planet wheel 3, each holder being connected to a belt<br>
sheave. A belt runs over the belt sheaves and over intermediate deflection sheaves in the manner<br>
already explained, which means that adjacent screeding disks have opposite directions of rotation. At<br>
the same time the planet disk carrying the screeding disks is driven in the same way as explained<br>
earlier. In this embodiment also, the belt transmissions can be replaced wholly or in part by gear<br>
transmissions or transmissions having a frictional engagement.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the arrangement according to the invention, the planet disk 3 is driven<br>
by its own motor 11. The belt 10, which in the embodiment according to figures 1 a, lb runs over belt<br>
sheaves 8, then runs instead over the belt sheave 1 la of the motor 11. Separate driving of the planet<br>
disk 3 affords two advantages : firstly it is possibly to freely select the direction of rotation of the<br>
planet disk 3 and secondly the speed of rotation can be selected irrespective of the speed of the<br>
screeding disks, in order to obtain the optimum screeding result. A gear transmission can obviously<br>
also be used in this embodiment instead of the belt transmission.<br>
Although the invention above has been primarily illustrated and explained in connection with a<br>
screeding unit for a manually operated screeding machine, it will be obvious that the screeding unit<br>
according to the invention affords the same advantages when it is fitted to a powered screeding<br>
machine. It is also advantageous here that lateral forces occuring are minimised and that the effective<br>
screeding profile of the screeding unit permits screeding with little overlap.<br>
