Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or prodrugs thereof which are useful as medicaments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, pharmaceutical uses thereof and intermediates for production thereof.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives having an inhibitory activity in human SGLT1, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or prodrugs thereof which are useful as agents for the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia such as diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glycemia, diabetic complications or obesity, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, pharmaceutical uses thereof and intermediates for production thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes is one of lifestyle-related diseases with the background of change of eating habit and lack of exercise. Hence , diet and exercise therapies are performed in patients with diabetes.  Furthermore, when its sufficient control and continuous performance are difficult, drug treatment is simultaneously performed.  In addition, it has been confirmed <br>
by large-scale clinical trial that it is necessary to practice a long-term control of blood sugar level strictly so as to preven~t patients with diabetes from occuring and advancing diabetic complications by recieving treatment (see the following References 1 and 2). Furthermore, many epidemiologic studies on impaired glucose tolerance and macroangiopathy show tha~t impaired glucose tolerance as the boundary type is also a rislk factor in macroangiopathy as well as diabetes. Thus, needs to improve postprandial hyperglycemia have been focused (see the following Reference 3).<br>
In recent years, development of various antidiabetic agents has been progressing with the background of a rapid increase of patients with diabetes. For example, a- glucosidas e inhibitors, which delay carbohydrate digestion and absorption at the small intestine, are used to improve postprandial hyperglycemia. It has been also reported that acarbose, one of a-glucosidase inhibitors, has an effect of preventing ox delaying the incidence of diabetes by applying to patients with impaired glucose tolerance (see the following Reference 4) . However, since a-glucosidase inhibitors do not affect elevated glucose levels by ingesting a monosaccharide of glucose (see the following Reference 5) , with recently changing compositions of sugars in meals, it has been desired to develop agents which exert a wider range of activities inhibiting carbohydrate absorption.<br>
In the meantime, it has been known that SGLT1, sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1, exists in the small<br><br>
intestine which controls carbohydrate absorption.  It has been, also reported that insufficiency of glucose and galactose absorption arises in patients with dysfunction due to congenital abnormalities of human SGLT1 (see the following References 6 - 8) . In addition, it has been confirmed that SGLT1 is involved in glucose and galactose absorption (see the following References 9 and 10).<br>
Furthermore, it is confirmed that mRNA and protein of SGLT1. increase and absorption of glucoses are accelerated in OLETP rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic symptoms (see the following References 11 and 12). Generally in patients with diabetes. carbohydrate digestion and absorption are increased . For example, it is confirmed that mRNA and protein of SGLT1 are highly increased in the human small intestine (see the following Reference 13).<br>
Therefore, blocking a human SGLT1 activity inhibits absorption of carbohydrates such as glucose at the small intestine, subsequently can prevent increase of blood sugar level. Especially, it is considered that delaying glucose absorption based on the above mentioned mechanism is effective to normalize postprandial hyperglycemia.  In addition, since increase of SGLT1 in the small intestine is thought to contribute to increased carbohydrate absorption, fast development of agents , which have a potent inhibitory activity in human SGLT1, has been desired for the prevention or treatment of diabetes.

Test Example 1<br>
Assay for inhibitory effects on human SGLT1 activity 1) Cloning and construction of the vector expressing human SGLT1 The cDNA library was prepared for PCR amplification by reverse transcription from total RNA deprived from human small intestine (Ori gene) using oligo-dT as a primer. Using this<br><br>
cDNA library as a template, the DNA fragment coding 1 to 2005 bp of human SGLTl (ACCESSION: M24847), which was reported by Hediger et al. , was amplified by PCR method and inserted into the multi-cloning site of pcDNA3.1(- ) (Invitrogen) . The DNA sequence inserted was perfectly matched to the previously reported sequence.<br>
2)	Establishment of cell line stably expressing human SGLTl<br>
The expression vector of human SGLTl was digested by Sea I into a linear DNA. The linear DNA was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by means of lipofection (Effectene Transfection Reagent: QIAGEN) . Neomycin resistant cell lines were selected by culture in the medium containing G418 (1 mg/mL, LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) , and then the activity against the uptake of methyl-α-D-gluco-pyranoside was measured by the method described below. The cell line, which showed the greatest uptake activity, was selected and designated as CS1-5-11D. CS1-5-11D cells were cultured in the presence of G418 at 200 µg/mL.<br>
3)	Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake<br>
of methyl-4-D-glucopyranoside (a-MG)<br>
CS1-5-11D cells were seeded into a 96-well culture plate<br>
at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well and cultured for 2 days, and<br>
were used in the uptake assay. A mixture of non-labeled (Sigma)<br>
and  14C-labeled a-MG (Amersham Pharmcia Biotec) was added to the uptake buffer (pH 7.4; containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulf onic acid, and 5 mM tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) at the<br><br><br>
final concentration of 1 mM. A test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then appropriately diluted with distilled water.  The test compound solution was added to the uptake buffer containing 1 mM α-MG, and designated as a measurement buffer. For the control group, the measurement buffer without any test compound was prepared. For measuring the basal uptake, a basal uptake measurement buffer which contains 140 mM chorine chloride instead of sodium chloride was prepared. After removing the culture medium of CS1 - 5 -1 ID cells, 180 µL of the pre-treatment buffer (the basal uptake buffer without a-MG) was added to each well and incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes. After repeating the same treatment, the pre-treatment buffer was removed. To each well was added 75 µL of the measurement buffer or the basal uptake buffer was added and incubated at 37C C for 1 hour. After removing the measurement buffer, cells were washed twice with 180 µL per well of the washing buffer (the basal uptake buffer containing 10 mM non-labeled a-MG) . The cells were solubilized by 75 µL per well of 0 . 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide. The cell lysates were transferred into PicoPlates (Packard), and then added 150 µL of MicroScint-40 (Packard) and mixed. Radioactivity was measured by means of micro-scintillation counter TopCount (Packard) . One hundred % was set to the difference between the uptake in the control group and the basal uptake, and the uptake of methyl α-D-gluco-pyranoside at each drug concentration were calculated.  The drug concentration , at which 50% uptake of methyl α-D-glucopyranoside was inhibited (IC50 value), was calculated using logit plot.<br><br>
