BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method and system for<br>
transmitting and receiving data in a wireless communication system. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to a method and system for transmitting and<br>
receiving broadcast service data in a wireless communication system.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
In a wireless communication system, the term "data" generally refers to<br>
unicast data transmitted from one subscriber station (SS) or one system to another<br>
SS or another system. Unicast data transmitted such that it can be received at only<br>
an individual SS, is transmitted at the request of a corresponding user. However,<br>
with the development of wireless communication technology, there has been a<br>
growing demand for receiving broadcast service provided in the public network<br>
even in a wireless communication system. The broadcast service, unlike the<br>
unicast service, is characterized by a plurality of SSs being able to receive the<br>
same traffic.<br>
A mobile communication system using cellular technology is presented as<br>
a typical example of a wireless communication system. The cellular mobile<br>
communication system has developed from the conventional system capable of<br>
supporting only voice communication into an advanced system capable of<br>
supporting high-speed data transmission. Recently, research relating to mobile<br>
communication systems has been conducted to provide a broadcast service using<br>
3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 3rd Generation Partnership Project<br>
2 (3GPP2), which are standardization groups for a 3rd generation (3G) mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
However, the mobile communication system has a difficulty in efficiently<br>
providing the broadcast service in terms of a data rate. That is, the mobile<br>
communication system basically uses a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)<br>
scheme, and its frequency band is fixed. The CDMA mobile communication<br>
system spreads data using Walsh codes prior to transmission. The Walsh codes are<br><br>
limited resources, and extension of the codes thereof is very difficult.<br>
Accordingly, there is a demand for a new scheme, which is not simply<br>
dependent on the CDMA scheme, to provide a broadcast service in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method and<br>
system for efficiently transmitting and receiving a broadcast service in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and<br>
system for transmitting and receiving a broadcast service at high speed in a<br>
wireless communication system.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a method<br>
and system for transmitting and receiving a broadcast service without the<br>
influence of spreading code resources in a mobile communication system.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for transmitting broadcast service data in a wireless communication<br>
system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)<br>
scheme in which data transmission is achieved through a downlink and an uplink<br>
within one frame, the system being connected to a broadcast server. The method<br>
comprising the steps of allocating a connection identifier (CID) to each broadcast<br>
service for identification of a broadcast service packet transmitted over the<br>
downlink, and transmitting broadcast service information for each broadcast<br>
service; and receiving a broadcast packet from the broadcast server, and<br>
transmitting a physical layer transmission information element (DL-MAP)<br>
comprising a broadcast service CID for the broadcast packet through the<br>
downlink.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for receiving broadcast service data in a wireless communication system<br>
using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme in<br>
which data transmission is achieved through a downlink and an uplink within one<br>
frame. The system being connected to a broadcast server for transmitting a<br><br>
broadcast service packet and its associated broadcast service connection identifier<br>
(CID) using a physical layer transmission information element (DL-MAP). The<br>
method comprising the steps of receiving broadcast service information for a<br>
desired broadcast service from the wireless communication system; detecting a<br>
desired broadcast service CID from a DL-MAP for frames received through the<br>
downlink; and receiving a broadcast service packet by acquiring position<br>
information of a broadcast service packet using the broadcast service CID when<br>
there is a packet comprising the broadcast service CID.<br>
According to further another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a system for providing broadcast service data in a wireless<br>
communication system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme in which data transmission is achieved through a downlink<br>
and an uplink within one frame. The system comprising a broadcast server for<br>
providing broadcast service data; and a broadcast service controller for receiving<br>
broadcast content data from the broadcast server, storing the received broadcast<br>
content data in a buffer thereof, and providing a broadcast service packet and<br>

the wireless communication system if the broadcast content data stored in the<br>
buffer satisfies a predetermined condition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Several embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for providing a<br>
broadcast service in a wireless communication system. The present invention<br>
supports a broadcast service at a high data rate which is higher than that of the 3rd<br>
generation (3G) mobile communication system having a mid/low data rate<br>
compared with that of a system using Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 technology (hereinafter referred to as an "802.16<br>
system." The 802.16 standard is incorporated herein by reference. Herein, a<br>
description will be made of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme in addition to several physical layer technologies used in the 3G<br><br>
mobile communication system. Also, a method for efficiently reducing power<br>
consumption in the 3G mobile communication system will be described.<br>
The following description presents (1) a method for transmitting a<br>
broadcast service and identifying a broadcast packet, (2) a method for<br>
continuously receiving a broadcast service, (3) a method for efficiently reducing<br>
reception power, and (4) a method for increasing efficiency of reception power<br>
using a physical layer transmission information element in a dynamic broadcast<br>
transmission method.<br>
[1] Method for Transmitting Broadcast Service and Identifying Broadcast<br>
Packet<br>
In a high-speed wireless communication system directed primarily at<br>
unicast service, in order to support a broadcast service, a base station (BS) should<br>
be able to indicate whether a transmission physical layer frame comprises a<br>
broadcast packet and whether a particular packet is a broadcast packet. To this<br>
end, the BS should inform subscriber stations (SSs) when a broadcast packet is<br>
transmitted. As an alternative method, the BS can indicate a physical layer frame<br>
over which a broadcast packet is transmitted, by recording information indicating<br>
the inclusion of a broadcast packet in the physical layer frame over which the<br>
corresponding broadcast packet is transmitted, before transmitting the physical<br>
layer frame. Therefore, the BS writes an identifier (ID) allocated for broadcast in<br>
a header of a medium access control (MAC) layer packet for each of broadcast<br>
services included in a physical layer frame so that SSs can determine whether a<br>
particular packet is a broadcast packet.<br>
In the 802.16 system, an exemplary system to which the present invention<br>
is applied, the method for identifying a broadcast service packet allocates a<br>
particular connection ID (CID) to each broadcast service and writes the allocated<br>
CID in a MAC layer packet for each broadcast packet prior to transmission. In<br>
addition, the method writes information indicating transmission of a broadcast<br>
service in a physical layer transmission information element (DL-MAP) through<br>
which the broadcast services are transmitted so that an SS receiving the physical<br>
layer transmission information element can determine whether a broadcast packet<br>
is included in a corresponding frame.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a format of a general physical layer<br>
transmission information element used in an 802.16 system. The physical layer<br><br>
transmission information element of FIG. 1 illustrates a downlink MAP<br>
information element (DL-MAP). With reference to FIG. 1, a format of the general<br>
physical layer transmission information element used in the 802.16 system will be<br>
described below.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a 'DIUC field, a field indicating a transmission type<br>
popularly used in the 802.16 system, indicates a downlink transmission type for a<br>
channel specified in the physical layer transmission information element. A<br>
'INCCID' field indicates whether a CID is included in the corresponding<br>
physical layer transmission information element. An 'N_CID' field indicates the<br>
number of CIDs included in the corresponding physical layer transmission<br>
information element, and a 'CID' field indicates a CID of data transmitted over a<br>
channel indicated by the physical layer transmission information element. An<br>
'OFDMA Symbol offset' field indicates a start point of an OFDMA symbol<br>
through which corresponding data is transmitted within a frame, and a 'No.<br>
OFDMA Symbols' field indicates the number of the OFDMA symbols. A<br>
'Subchannel offset' field indicates a start point of a channel over which<br>
corresponding data is transmitted, and a 'No. Subchannels' field indicates the<br>
number of corresponding channels. A 'Boosting' field indicates an additional<br>
power level used for transmission of corresponding data.<br>
In this section, a description will be made of a method for writing a point<br>
or location of a broadcast service packet in a physical layer frame using the<br>
physical layer transmission information element illustrated in FIG. 1 to provide a<br>
broadcast service.<br>
The present invention provides a method for setting a value of the<br>
'INCCID' field indicating inclusion of a CID among the fields of the physical<br>
layer transmission information element, to '0', and indicates a point where a<br>
broadcast service packet is transmitted, using the 'OFDMA Symbol offset' field,<br>
the 'No. OFDMA Symbols' field, the 'Subchannel offset' field, and the 'No.<br>
Subchannels' field. A SS receiving the physical layer transmission information<br>
element set in this manner, can recognize that a packet transmitted at the point<br>
indicated by the 'OFDMA Symbol offset' field, the 'No. OFDMA Symbols' field,<br>
the 'Subchannel offset' field, and the 'No. Subchannels' field is a broadcast<br>
service packet, depending on the fact that a value of the 'INC_CID' field is set to<br>
'0'. In addition, the SS can recognize a point where the broadcast service packet<br>
is located, using the foregoing fields, and can receive the broadcast service packet<br><br>
according to the result. The SS determines whether corresponding broadcast is its<br>
desired broadcast through a CID in a MAC layer header of the received packet. If<br>
the received broadcast is its desired broadcast, the SS transmits the corresponding<br>
packet to an upper layer. However, if the received broadcast is not its desired<br>
broadcast, the SS discards the corresponding packet.<br>
[2] Method for Continuously Receiving Broadcast Service<br>
In a high-speed broadcast service system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention, a basic method for transmitting broadcast content is as<br>
follows. When broadcast service data is transmitted from a broadcast server to a<br>
broadcast service controller, the broadcast service controller stores the broadcast<br>
service data in its buffer. The broadcast service controller transmits the broadcast<br>
packet to SSs in each cell if a size of the data stored in its buffer is greater than a<br>
predetermined threshold, or at a transmission time determined based on Quality-<br>
of-Service (QoS) of the broadcast. In this method, for the time at which each<br>
broadcast is transmitted, transmission characteristics such as a data rate (source<br>
rate) and a transmission delay of the broadcast service change with the passage of<br>
time.<br>
For example, if a source rate of a particular broadcast service<br>
instantaneously increases or decreases, a transmission time of the corresponding<br>
broadcast service instantaneously goes ahead or falls behind. If a transmission<br>
time for a particular broadcast service dynamically changes in this way, an SS<br>
cannot determine the time at which broadcast packets will be transmitted.<br>
Therefore, the SS should always monitor a broadcast channel transmitted in the<br>
downlink direction. As a result, the SS should receive and process even the<br>
downlink transmission frames which are not related to reception of the broadcast<br>
service, resulting in a considerable increase in its power consumption. Therefore,<br>
in the next section, a method for increasing the efficiency of reception power for a<br>
broadcast service will be described.<br>
[3] Method for Increasing Efficiency of Reception Power<br>
In this section, a description will be made of a semi-static broadcast<br>
transmission/reception technique capable of reducing power consumption by<br>
observing only the downlink transmission frames associated with a broadcast<br>
service in receiving the broadcast service by an SS in an 802.16 system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
(A) Method for Increasing Efficiency of Reception Power by Fixing<br>
Broadcast Transmission Time<br>
A description will now be made of a broadcast transmission/reception<br>
method using the semi-static broadcast transmission technique according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention to reduce use of reception power for SSs<br>
receiving a broadcast service.<br>
In the method according to this embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
broadcast service controller previously determines a transmission time for each of<br>
broadcast services in service for a long time interval. The broadcast service<br>
controller transmits information on the transmission time in the message format to<br>
SSs via a BS on a unicast basis or on a broadcast basis. An SS receiving<br>
transmission time information for its desired broadcast services, can reduce power<br>
consumption due to unnecessary downlink reception by transitioning to an idle<br>
mode or a sleep mode. The SS in the idle mode or the sleep mode receives a<br>
downlink channel at the time when its desired broadcast is transmitted, in addition<br>
to the periodic data that the SS should necessarily receive in the idle mode or the<br>
sleep mode. In the other time period, the SS stops reception of a downlink<br>
channel, thereby minimizing power consumption due to reception of broadcast<br>
service.<br>
A message used for receiving a broadcast service in this method will now<br>
be described. FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a format of a broadcast configuration<br>
(MBS-CFG) message transmitted from a BS supporting the novel semi-static<br>
broadcast traffic transmission method to SSs according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The broadcast configuration message illustrated in FIG. 2 indicates a<br>
period between a frame for which a particular broadcast is transmitted and each<br>
transmission and also indicates the number of consecutive frames used for one<br>
transmission, so that even though an SS receiving this message does not<br>
continuously receive a downlink channel, the SS can determine the point where<br>
the particular broadcast begins or is transmitted. In addition, the broadcast<br>
configuration message describes the next time at which the broadcast<br>
configuration message is to be transmitted, so that even though an SS receiving<br>
this message does not continuously receive a downlink channel, the SS can<br>
receive the broadcast configuration message at predetermined intervals. The<br>
broadcast service controller fixes the time when a particular broadcast is<br><br>
transmitted for every transmission period of the broadcast configuration message,<br>
and if it is desired to change the transmission time and the transmission method,<br>
the broadcast service controller indicates a new transmission method during<br>
transmission of the next broadcast configuration message. After transmitting the<br>
broadcast configuration message, the broadcast service controller can transmit the<br>
next broadcast configuration messages using the indicated new transmission<br>
method.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a 'Management Message Type' field, a field<br>
indicating a type of a corresponding message, can have a particular value<br>
appropriate for the broadcast configuration message. A 'Next MBS-CFG<br>
transmission frame offset' field indicates the next time at which the broadcast<br>
configuration message is transmitted. A 'N_MBS_Configuration' field indicates<br>
the number of broadcast transmission information elements included in the<br>
broadcast configuration message, and a 'MBS_Configuration_IE()' field is a<br>
block indicating the detailed broadcast transmission information element. A<br>
detailed description of the 'MBS_Configuration_IE()' field will be given later. A<br>
'Padding nibble' field is a dummy field attached to make the broadcast<br>
configuration message comprise 8 bits.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a format of a broadcast configuration<br>
block (MBS_Configuration_IE) according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. With reference to FIG. 3, a format of the broadcast configuration block<br>
will be described below.<br>
In the MBS_Configuration_IE() block, an 'N_MBS' field indicates the<br>
number of broadcast services included in this block. As many 'MBS CID' fields<br>
as the number indicated by the 'N_MBS' field are included in the<br>
MBS_Configuration_IE() block, and the 'MBS CID' field indicates a CID<br>
corresponding to a particular broadcast. A 'Physical Frequency' field indicates<br>
information on a frequency band in which broadcast services corresponding to the<br>
CID are transmitted. A 'Transmission start frame offset' field indicates an interval<br>
between a physical layer frame in which a broadcast service is included and the<br>
current frame, and a 'Transmission frame length' field indicates the number of<br>
consecutive frames used for broadcast transmission. Finally, a 'Transmission<br>
frame period index' field indicates a period for which the corresponding broadcast<br>
is transmitted next.<br><br>
(B) Method for Increasing Efficiency of Reception Power by Designating<br>
Point of Broadcast Data in A Physical Layer Frame<br>
A description will now be made of a method for transmitting, to an SS,<br>
information on a point or location in broadcast data in a physical layer frame over<br>
which broadcast is transmitted, so as to reduce use of reception power for SSs<br>
desiring to receive the broadcast. The broadcast service controller according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention designates a transmission time for each of<br>
broadcast services in service plus a transmission point of a corresponding<br>
broadcast in a physical layer frame for the transmission time, and transmits<br>
information on the transmission time to SSs via a BS on a unicast basis or on a<br>
broadcast basis. Therefore, each SS receives a transmission time plus a<br>
transmission point in a frame for each of its desired broadcast services. Thereafter,<br>
when receiving a corresponding frame at a transmission time of the corresponding<br>
broadcast, the SS receives only the channels in the previously designated point,<br>
thereby minimizing power consumption needed for reception of a physical layer<br>
frame over which the broadcast is transmitted. When a particular SS operates in<br>
an idle mode or a sleep mode, the SS selectively receives only the channels in the<br>
previously designated point in a physical layer frame at the time when its desired<br>
broadcast is transmitted, in addition to the periodic data that the SS should<br>
necessarily receive in the idle mode or the sleep mode, thereby minimizing power<br>
consumption due to reception of broadcast service.<br>
In order to selectively receive only the channels in the point designated in<br>
a physical layer frame at the time when a desired broadcast is transmitted, the<br>
foregoing broadcast configuration block should be modified. FIG. 4 is a diagram<br>
illustrating a format of a broadcast configuration block (MBS_Configuration_IE)<br>
used for providing a broadcast service according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a modified MBS_ConfigurationlE block provided to<br>
specify a point in a frame, at which a particular broadcast is transmitted. In the<br>
modified MBS_Configuration_IE block, a start point, indicated by the 'OFDMA<br>
Symbol offset' field, of a symbol transmitted in a particular frame over which a<br>
broadcast corresponding to a particular MBS CID is transmitted; the number of<br>
symbols, indicated by the 'No. OFDMA Symbols' field; a start point of a channel<br>
used at the time, indicated by the 'Subchannel offset' field; the number of<br>
channels, indicated by the 'No. Subchannel offset' field; and a transmission type<br>
used in the transmission period, indicated by the 'DIUC field, can be newly<br><br>
specified.<br>
(C) Broadcast Reception Process<br>
A description will now be made of a signaling procedure for efficiently<br>
transmitting/receiving broadcast traffic using the foregoing method. FIG. 5 is a<br>
signaling diagram illustrating a procedure for transmitting/receiving broadcast<br>
traffic using a semi-static broadcast transmission method according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in step 500, an SS receives broadcast-related<br>
information such as a CID and encryption information for a corresponding<br>
broadcast service from among its desired broadcasts. The SS receiving a CID for<br>
its desired broadcast, continuously receives a downlink channel in steps 502 and<br>
504 before receiving a broadcast configuration message, analyzes packets<br>
transmitted to the CID, and receives the broadcast according to the analysis result.<br>
The SS continuously receiving a downlink channel, receives a broadcast<br>
configuration message transmitted at a particular time, in step 506. Because the<br>
broadcast configuration message comprises transmission time information such as<br>
offset, length and period of a broadcast desired by the SS, the SS can determine a<br>
time at which the next broadcast is to be received even though it does not<br>
continuously receive a downlink channel. In step 508, the SS transitions to an idle<br>
mode or a sleep mode to reduce power consumption. Thereafter, the SS can<br>
receive the transmitted broadcast service packet even in the idle mode or the sleep<br>
mode in steps 510 to 514.<br>
[4] Method for Increasing Efficiency of Reception Power Using Physical<br>
Layer Transmission Information in Dynamic Broadcast Transmission Method<br>
In this section, a description will be made of a method for reducing power<br>
consumption by observing only the downlink transmission frames associated with<br>
a broadcast service in receiving the broadcast service by an SS in an 802.16<br>
system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The second<br>
embodiment provides a method for modifying and transmitting a physical layer<br>
transmission information element of a physical layer frame over which a<br>
broadcast is transmitted during broadcast transmission.<br>
(A) Method for Increasing Efficient of Reception Power Using Through<br>
Modification of Physical Layer Transmission Information<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention records, in a physical<br><br>
layer transmission information element (DL-MAP) of a physical layer frame over<br>
which a broadcast is transmitted, information on a time at which the broadcast<br>
services transmitted over the frame will be transmitted next, so as to reduce use of<br>
reception power for SSs desiring to receive the broadcast. In this method, an SS<br>
receiving the physical layer frame can determine the time at which it should<br>
observe a downlink channel to receive a particular broadcast even through the SS<br>
does not continuously receive the downlink channel. That is, a BS specifies, in a<br>
physical layer transmission information element of a physical layer frame for<br>
transmitting particular broadcasts, e.g., Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation<br>
(MBC) and Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), a time in the physical layer<br>
frame, at which MBC is transmitted next, and a time in the physical layer frame,<br>
at which KBS is transmitted next, and then transmits the time information-<br>
specified physical layer transmission information element to SSs in its cell. A SS<br>
receiving the time information receives MBC and KBS and analyzes physical<br>
layer transmission information included in the corresponding physical layer frame<br>
thereby extracting information on the next time at which MBC and KBS will be<br>
transmitted.<br>
In order to support the foregoing method, it is necessary to modify a<br>
format of a physical layer transmission information element (BMAPIE). FIG. 6<br>
is a diagram illustrating a format of a physical layer transmission information<br>
element BMAPIE for indicating a transmission time of a broadcast service<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention. With reference to FIG.<br>
6, a description will now be made of a format of a physical layer transmission<br>
information element BMAP_IE according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
An 'Offset' field of the BMAP_IE illustrated in FIG. 6 indicates a<br>
difference in point or location between the current frame and the frame for which<br>
the broadcasts included in the corresponding frame are transmitted next. A SS<br>
receiving a physical layer transmission information element indicating inclusion<br>
of a broadcast packet, can receive broadcast packets of the corresponding frame<br>
and determine a point of the next frame over which the corresponding broadcasts<br>
will be transmitted, using the BMAPJE included in the frame.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating another format of a physical layer<br>
transmission information element BMPA_IE for indicating a transmission time of<br>
a broadcast service according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 7, a description will now be made of another format of a<br>
physical layer transmission information element BMAPIE.<br>
Aside from the predefined 'Offset' field, a CID for a broadcast can be<br>
described in the physical layer transmission information element BMAPIE of<br>
FIG. 7. With the use of the BMAP_IE, it is possible to describe a different<br>
broadcast time for each of different broadcasts corresponding to different CIDs.<br>
That is, it is possible to correctly express different broadcast times for different<br>
broadcasts by separately describing the BMAPIEs for different broadcasts<br>
having different broadcast times in one frame.<br>
(B) Method for Increasing Efficiency of Reception Power Through<br>
Modification of MAC Layer Header<br>
In order to reduce use of reception power for SSs desiring to receive a<br>
broadcast, a BS writes, in a MAC Layer header of a transmission broadcast<br>
packet, information on a time at which the broadcast service will be transmitted<br>
next in the packet. In this method, an SS receiving the broadcast packet can<br>
determine the next time when it should observe a downlink channel to receive a<br>
particular broadcast, even though the SS does not continuously receive the<br>
downlink channel. That is, when transmitting two MAC layer packets including<br>
particular broadcasts, for example, MBC and KBS, with one physical layer frame,<br>
a BS specifies a time of the physical layer frame, at which MBC will be<br>
transmitted next, in a header of a MAC layer packet comprising MBC, and<br>
specifies a time of the physical layer frame, at which KBS will be transmitted<br>
next, in a header of a MAC layer packet comprising KBS, and transmits the time<br>
information-specified MAC layer packets to each of the SSs. A SS receiving the<br>
time information, receives MBC and KBS and analyzes information on the<br>
corresponding MAC layer packet thereby extracting information on the next time<br>
at which MBC and KBS will be transmitted.<br>
A description will now be made of a format of a MAC layer header used<br>
in the 802.16 system. FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a format of a MAC layer<br>
header used in the 802.16 system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a 'Header Type (HT)' field indicates a type of<br>
corresponding header, and an 'Encryption Control (EC)' field indicates whether<br>
encryption is used. A 6-bit 'Type' field indicates a type of a sub-header or a<br>
format of a MAC layer packet, and a 'CRC Indicator (CI)' field indicates whether<br><br>
CRC is added to a MAC layer packet. An 'Encryption Key Sequence (EKS)' field<br>
indicates sequence information of en encryption key, and 'Reserved (RSV)' fields<br>
are fields reserved for future use. A 'LEN' field indicates a length of a MAC layer<br>
packet, and a 'CID' field indicates a CID associated with the corresponding MAC<br>
layer packet. Finally, a 'Header Check Sequence (HCS)' field serves as a<br>
checksum for checking an error for the header.<br>
In the MAC layer header for a broadcast packet, if a specific bit, for<br>
example, a bit #0 or a bit #4, of the 'Type' field is set to ' 1', or if one of the two<br>
'RSV fields is set to '1', it is used as a sub-header that specifies the next<br>
transmission time of the corresponding broadcast.<br>
A method for using the sub-header will now be described. FIG. 9 is a<br>
diagram illustrating a format of a MAC layer header that specifies the next<br>
transmission time of broadcast traffic according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the MAC layer header according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention has a new MAC layer header format to which an 8-bit<br>
'Offset' field is added. The 'Offset' field is used to indicate an interval between<br>
the current frame and the frame for which a broadcast transmitted with a MAC<br>
layer packet is to be transmitted next.<br>
Therefore, an SS receiving the MAC layer header can determine the next<br>
transmission time of a broadcast associated with a corresponding CID (MBC<br>
CID) using the 'Offset' field. That is, if the current frame over which a broadcast<br>
has been received is an nth frame, the SS can recognize that a frame at which the<br>
broadcast will arrive next becomes an {(n + Offset) mod 224 (=maximum frame<br>
number +1)} frame.<br>
(C) Process of Receiving Broadcast with Efficient Reception Power<br>
Using Physical Layer Transmission Information<br>
A description will now be made of a process of transmitting/receiving<br>
broadcast packets between an SS and a BS using physical layer transmission<br>
information in a dynamic broadcast transmission method.<br>
FIG. 10 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of transmitting and<br>
receiving broadcast packets between an SS and a BS using a dynamic broadcast<br><br>
transmission method according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, in step 1000, an SS receives broadcast-related<br>
information such as a CID and encryption information for a corresponding<br>
broadcast from among its desired broadcasts. The SS receiving a CID for its<br>
desired broadcast, continuously receives a downlink channel in step 1002 before<br>
it initially receives the corresponding broadcast packet. The SS continuously<br>
receiving the downlink channel, receives a first packet for its desired broadcast in<br>
step 1004, and can acquire the next transmission time information (Offset)<br>
included in a MAC layer header for the packet. The SS receiving the next<br>
transmission time information for the corresponding packet, can determine a time<br>
at which the next broadcast is to be received even though it does not continuously<br>
receive a downlink channel. In step 1006, the SS transitions to an idle mode or a<br>
sleep mode to reduce power consumption. Thereafter, in step 1008, the SS can<br>
receive the next broadcast packet using the received broadcast transmission time<br>
information and acquire transmission time information of the next broadcast<br>
packet from a MAC layer header of the packet. Therefore, the SS can receive the<br>
transmitted broadcast packets in steps 1010 to 1012. In this manner, the SS can<br>
continuously receive its desired broadcast packets even in the idle mode or the<br>
sleep mode.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, the method can<br>
provide a high-speed broadcast service in the 802.16 system, for example. In<br>
addition, the novel method transmits broadcast packets using a dynamic or semi-<br>
static method so that a reception apparatus can efficiently reduce reception power.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
