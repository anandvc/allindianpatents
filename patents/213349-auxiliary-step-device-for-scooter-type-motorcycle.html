				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] <br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
THe present invention relates to an auxiliary step device of a scooter type two-seater motorcycle.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
In general, a scooter type two-seater motorcycle includes a double seat on which a driver and a fellow passenger are seated; a floor panel for allowing the driver to rest the feet thereon, which is provided on the front portion of the body; and an auxiliary step for allowing the fellow passenger to rest the foot thereon, which is provided on the rear portion of the body.<br>
Various auxiliary steps improved for allowing a fellow passenger to ride on a motorcycle in a comfortable posture have been known, for example, from © a technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 6-13307 titled "Auxiliary Foot Rest Device", and a technique in which an auxiliary step is directly provided on a body cover .<br>
The technique will be described with reference to Figs. 1, 3 of the document.  In addition, the description is made using the same reference numerals as those described in the document. A front step portion 16A having a height equivalent to that of a rear wheel 32 is provided on a rear frame 16, and tiltable auxiliary foot rests 66a, 66b (equivalent to auxiliary steps) are fixed at positions near the rear portion of the front step portion 16A. Each of the auxiliary foot rests 66a, 66b is of a bar type (pillion step), and it is tilted along the lower edge of the rear cover 48 to be contained when any fellow passenger does not ride on the motorcycle. <br>
The technique  is characterized in that auxiliary steps integrally formed on rear, lower edges of both side<br>
surfaces of a body cover are disposed over a power unit. <br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The technique 0, however, is disadvantageous in that the auxiliary foot rests 66a, 66b are disposed at a high position nearly equal to that of the upper edge of the rear wheel 32 and further they are of a bar-type so that a fellow passenger is not necessarily easy in getting on/off the motorcycle and must ride thereon in an uncomfortable posture in which the leg is bent.<br>
On the other hand, the technique ©is also disadvantageous in that the position of each auxiliary step is limited by formation of the body cover and the step width is small so that a fellow passenger using the auxiliary steps is not easy in getting on/off the motorcycle and is not comfortable in foot rest for a long period of time. <br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle, which allows a fellow passenger to get on/off the motorcycle and to ride on it in a comfortable posture.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to the invention described in claim 1, there is provided an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle including a seat having a seating portion for a fellow passenger and provided on a body frame, and a body cover for covering the body frame and lower surroundings of the seat, the auxiliary step device including: a step frame suspended from the body frame in the body cover and extending in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge of the body cover; and a plate-like step mounted on an extended portion of the step frame in such a manner as to project sideward from the body. Here, the plate-like step on which a fellow passenger rests the foot is formed of a flat plate having, for example, an approximately rectangular shape in a plan view.<br>
Since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger,the fellow<br>
passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable<br>
posture.  For example, by setting the height of the plate-like step to be equal to that of the floor panel on which a<br><br>
driver rests the feet, a fellow passenger can ride the motorcycle in a comfortable posture like the driver. Also, since most of the step frame is covered with a body cover, the appearance performance can be improved.<br>
In addition, since the plate-like step is positioned outside the body cover, the mounting /dismounting of the body cover can be made easy, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of a power unit and the like.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, in addition to the feature of the invention described in claim 1, the step frame passes through a space between the lower edge of the body cover and a swing type power unit at the upper limit position.<br>
The plate-like step can be freely set in arrangement, for example, in terms of the mounting height without any limitation due to arrangement of the swing type power unit. This increases the degree of freedom in design of the plate-like step.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, in addition to the feature of the invention described in claim<br>
1 or 2, the plate-like step is fixed on the extended portion.<br>
The strength of the step can be further increased to the extent that a fellow passenger can easily get on/off the motorcycle using the step.<br>
Moreover, unlike the related art tiltable type, any operation for taking in /out the step is not required when a fellow passenger rides on the motorcycle, so that the hand of the fellow passenger is not soiled.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, in addition to the feature of the invention described in claim 1 or 2, the plate-like step is vertically tiltably mounted on the extended portion and is further biased to an exposure side by a spring.<br>
When being applied with an external force, the step is temporarily tilted against a biasing force of the spring. Consequently, even if an impact load is applied to the step, the spring can sufficiently absorbed it. <br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, there is provided an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle, including: a first step frame suspended<br>
from a body frame; a second step frame having a base portion to which the lower portion of the first step frame is connected through a body cover by means of a bolt; and a plate-like step mounted on the second step frame.<br>
Since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger, the fellow passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable posture .<br>
Moreover, since the first step frame serves as both a means for fixing the body cover and a means for fixing the second step frame, the mounting work to the body frame can be simplified.<br>
In addition, the body cover and the plate-like step can be removed only by loosening the bolt, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of the power unit and the like.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 6, there is provided an auxiliary step device for a scooter<br>
type motorcycle including a seat having a seating portion<br>
for a fellow passenger and provided on a body frame, and a<br>
body cover for covering the body frame and lower<br>
surroundings of the seat, the auxiliary step device including: a step frame having a base portion connected to the inner surface of the body cover by means of a bolt, the step frame extending in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge of the body cover; and a plate-like step mounted on an extended portion of the step frame in such a manner as to project sideward from the body.<br>
Since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger, the fellow passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable posture.<br>
Moreover, since the step frame is mounted on the body cover, the plate-like step can be removed only by removal of the body cover, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of a power unit and the like.<br>
In addition, since the base portion of the step frame is fixed on the inner surface of the body cover, the fixing portion of the step frame is covered with the body cover, which improves the appearance performance.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle including a seat having a seating portion for a fellow passenger and provided on a body frame and a body cover for covering said body frame and lower surroundings of said seat characterized in that:<br>
a step frame is suspended in said body cover from a rear frame of said body frame which is located above a rear wheel, said step frame extending downward so as to be exposed from the lower edge of said body cover;<br>
a flat step is mounted on an extended portion of said step frame in such a manner as to project sideward from the vehicle body; and<br>
said step frame comprises a rearward extending horizontal portion a front end of which is mounted on a front part of said rear frame, and a rear upright portion which extends upward from the rear end of said horizontal portion and an upper end of which fixed on a rear part of said rear frame,<br>
wherein said step frame s fixed on the intermediate frame portion at three positions of the front end of the horizontal portion, an intermediate portion of said horizontal portion and an upper end of said rear upright portion; and<br>
wherein said step is mounted on said horizontal portion and near said rear upright portion.<br>

step device 60 includes a step frame 61 suspended from the intermediate frame portion 7b of the rear frame 7, and a plate-like step 72 fixed on a lower extended portion 65 of the step frame 61.<br>
The intermediate frame portion 7b is tilted rearward, upward from the rear portion of the front frame portion 7a as described above, and the step frame 61 is formed in accordance with the tilting of the intermediate frame portion 7b into an approximately inverted L-shape composed of a horizontal portion 62 and an upright rear portion 63 and made of pipe material. <br>
The step frame 61 is fixed on the intermediate frame portion 7b by means of bolts at three positions of the front end of the horizontal portion 62, the upper end of an arm 64 erected from an approximately intermediate portion of the horizontal portion 62, and the upper end of the upright rear portion 63.<br>
In the step frame 61, a portion near the corner between the horizontal portion 62 and the upright rear portion 63, that is, the extended portion 65 shown by the hatching in Fig. 3 extends outward (on this side in Fig. 3).  The plate-like step 72 is horizontally disposed on the<br>

Fig. 6 is a sectional view taken on line 6-6 of Fig. 3. A bracket 89 welded on the intermediate frame portion 7b is formed into a hat-like shape with the outer side open in a plan view. The upright rear portion 63 is fixed at the upper end with a channel-like support 68 with the inner side open in a plan view, and the support 68 is fitted with the projecting back surface of the hat- like cross-section of the bracket 89 and is further fixed thereto by means of a bolt 69. <br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view taken on line 7-7 of Fig. 3.  The auxiliary step device 60 has a configuration that a step arm 71 extends outward, upward, obliquely from the extended portion 65; the plate-like step 72 is fixed at the leading end of the step arm 71; and a step rubber 73 is placed on the upper surface of the plate-like' step 72 and is fixed thereto by a small screw 74. Accordingly, the plate-like step 72 is fixed on the extended portion 65. The plate-like step 72 on which the fellow<br>
passenger rests the foot thereon is formed of a flat plate having, for example, an approximately rectangular shape in a plan view. <br>
Fig. 8 is a rear view of the auxiliary step device (first embodiment) of the present invention, showing an arrangement of the auxiliary step device 60 as seen from the rear surface of the motorcycle.<br>
The step frame 61 is suspended from the left intermediate frame portion 7b of the rear frame 7 disposed over the rear wheel 22, and extends outward from the inside of the side cover 1.7 while bypassing a lower edge 17a of the side cover 17. The plate-like step 72 is mounted on the extended portion 65 of the step frame 61.<br>
In other words, the step frame 61 is suspended from the rear frame 7 of the body frame 2 in the body cover 10 and extends in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge of the body cover 10.  The plate-like step 72 is mounted on the extended portion 65 in such a manner as to project sideward from the body.    <br>
Accordingly, the step frame 61 passes through a space between the lower edge 17a of the side cover 17 and the swing type power unit 41 at the upper limit position<br>
shown by the imaginary line.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3, the mounting position of the support 68 is apart downward from a line L connecting the mounting position of the support 66 to the mounting position of the support 67. Namely, the mounting positions of the three supports 66, 67, 68 are arranged to form a triangular shape in a side view (in Fig. 3). As a result, the supports 66, 67, 68 can stably support the load applied to the step 72. <br>
Next, the function of the auxiliary step device 60 having the above configuration will be described with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
The step frame 61 extends in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge 17a of the side cover 17 (extends outward from the inside of the side cover 17 while bypassing the lower edge 17a), and the extended portion 65 of the step frame 61 is largely extends outward so as to be arranged at a position allowing the fellow passenger to easily rest the foot thereon.  Consequently the plate-like step 72 can be freely arranged, for example, in terms of its mounting height without any limitation due<br>
to arrangement of the side cover 17. This increases the degree of freedom in design of the plate-like step 72.  In other words, the plate-like step 72 can be set in such a design that the fellow passenger can easily get on/off the motorcycle 1 and can ride on it in a comfortable posture.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the height of the plate-like step 72 is set to be substantially equal to that of the floor panel 15 relatively low in height, that is, the height from the floor panel 15 to the upper surface of the seat 23 is substantially equal to the height from the plate-like step 72 to the upper surface of the seat 23. As a result, the plate-like step 72 being low in height allows the fellow passenger to easily get on/off the motorcycle like the driver.<br>
When the height from the plate-like step 72 to the upper surface of the seat 23 is excessively small, the fellow passenger must get on the motorcycle in a narrow posture in which the leg is bent. In the present invention, however, since the height is set at a suitable value substantially equal to the height from the floor panel 15 to the upper surface of the seat 23, the fellow passenger can get on the motorcycle in a comfortable<br>
posture like the driver.<br>
On the other hand, the swing type power unit 41 is vertically rocked between positions shown by a solid line and an imaginary line in Fig. 8. However, since the step frame 61 passes over the power unit 41 at the upper limit position, the auxiliary step device 60 is never brought in contact with the power unit 41. The plate-like step 72 can be thus freely set, for example, in terms of its mounting height without any limitation due to the arrangement of the power unit 41. This increases the degree of freedom in design of the plate-like step 72.  In other words, the plate-like step 72 can be set in such a design that the fellow passenger can easily get on/off the motorcycle 1 and can ride on it in a comfortable posture.<br>
The auxiliary step device 60 has the plate-like step 72 having a wide step space for allowing the fellow passenger to easily rest the foot thereon, so that the passenger can easily get on/off the motorcycle, can ride on it in a comfortable posture, and is not tired after riding for a long period of time.<br>
A second embodiment will be described below with<br>
reference to Fig. 9. It is to be noted that parts corresponding to those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same characters and the explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
Fig. 9 is a side view of an auxiliary step device (second embodiment) of the present invention, which is characterized in that a plate-like step 72 is vertically tiltably mounted on an extended portion 65, and further, it is biased on the exposure side shown by a solid line in this figure by a torsion spring 91 (as a biasing means).<br>
Specifically, a step arm 71 is vertically tiltably mounted on the extended portion 65 by means of a pin 92, and the plate-like step 72 is fixed on the leading end of the step arm 71.  In addition, reference numeral 93 indicates a stopper for determining the exposure position of the step arm 71.<br>
According to the second embodiment, when the plate-like step 72 is applied with an external force F, it is temporarily tilted against a biasing force of the torsion spring 91. Consequently, even if an impact load is applied to the plate-like step 72, the torsion spring 91 can sufficiently absorbed it.<br>
A third embodiment will be described below with reference to Fig. 10. It is to be noted that parts corresponding to those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same characters and the explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
Fig. 10 is a side view of an auxiliary step device (third embodiment) of the present invention, which is characterized in that a first step frame 94 is suspended from the intermediate frame portion 7b; the lower portion of the first step frame 94 is connected to the base portion of a second step frame 95 through the side cover 17 by means of a bolt 96; and a plate-like step 72 is mounted on the second step frame 95.<br>

Moreover, the side cover 17 and the plate-like step 72 can be removed only by loosening the bolt, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of the power unit 41 and the like.<br><br>
A fourth embodiment will be described below with reference to Fig. 11. It is to be noted that parts corresponding to those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same characters and the explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
Fig. 11 is a side view of an auxiliary step device (fourth embodiment) of the present invention, which is characterized in that the base portion of a step frame 98 is fixed on the inner surface of the side cover 17 by means of a bolt; the step frame 98 extends in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge 17a of the side cover 17; and a plate-like step 72 is mounted on an extended portion 98a in such a manner as to project sideward from the body. <br>
Specifically, in the fourth embodiment, a bracket 97 is provided on the inner surface of the side cover 17 and the base portion of the step frame 98 is fixed on the bracket 97 by means of a bolt 99; the step frame 98 extends<br>
outward while bypassing the lower edge 17a of the side<br>
» cover 17; and the plate-like step 72 is mounted on the<br>
extended portion 98a through a step arm 71.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment, since the step frame 98 is mounted on the side cover 17, the step 72 can be removed only by removal of the side cover 17, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of the power unit 41 and the like.<br>
Al though the auxiliary step device 60 is disposed on the left side of the body in the above-described first to fourth embodiments, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, it may be disposed on the right side of the body. Moreover, two pieces of the auxiliary step devices 60 may be each disposed on both the sides of the body. In the case where the auxiliary step device 60 is disposed on the left or right side of the body, the fellow passenger riding the motorcycle sideways can rest the foot on the plate-like step 72. On the other hand, in the case where the auxiliary step devices 60 are disposed on both the sides of the body, the fellow passenger riding astride the seat 23 can rest the feet on both the plate-like steps 72, 72. <br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention having the above-described<br>
configuration exhibits the following effects:<br>
The present invention described in claim 1 provides the auxiliary step device including: a step frame suspended from the body frame in the body cover and extending in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge of the body cover; and a plate-like step mounted on an extended portion of the step frame in such a manner as to project sideward from the body. Accordingly, since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger, the fellow passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable posture. For example, by setting the height of the plate-like step to be equal to that of the floor panel on which a driver rests the feet, a fellow passenger can ride the motorcycle in a comfortable posture like the driver. Also, since most of the step frame is covered with a body cover, the appearance performance can be improved.<br>
In addition, since the plate-like step is<br>
positioned outside the body cover, the mounting/dismounting of the body cover can be made easy, which improves<br>
t<br>
workability in maintenance and checking of a power unit and the like.<br>
In the invention described in claim 2, the step frame passes through a space between the lower edge of the body cover and a swing type power unit at the upper limit position. Accordingly, the plate-like step can be freely set in arrangement, for example, in terms of the mounting height without any limitation due to arrangement of the swing type power unit. This increases the degree of freedom in design of the plate-like step. <br>
In the invention described in claim 3, the plate-like step is fixed on the extended portion. Accordingly,<br>
the strength of the step can be further increased to the<br>
extent that a fellow passenger can easily get on/off the<br>
motorcycle using the step.<br>
Moreover, unlike the related art tiltable type, any<br>
operation for taking in/out the step is not required when a<br>
fellow passenger rides on the motorcycle, so that the hand<br>
of the fellow passenger is not soiled.<br><br>
In the invention described in claim 4, the plate-like step is vertically tiltably mounted on the extended portion and is further biased to an exposure side by a<br>
spring. Accordingly, when being applied with an external force, the step is temporarily tilted against a biasing force of the spring. Consequently, even if an impact load is applied to the step, the spring can sufficiently absorbed it.<br><br>
The invention described in claim 5 provides an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle, including: a first step frame suspended from a body frame; a second step frame having a base portion to which the lower portion of the first step frame is connected through a body cover by means of a bolt; and a plate-like step mounted on the second step frame. Accordingly, since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger, the fellow passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable posture.<br>
Moreover, since the first step frame serves as both a means for fixing the body cover and a means for fixing the second step frame, the mounting work to the body frame can be simplified.<br>
In addition, the body cover and the plate-like step can be removed only by loosening the bolt, which improves<br>
workability in maintenance and checking of the power unit and the like. <br>
The invention described in claim 6 provides an auxiliary step device for a scooter type motorcycle, including: a step frame having a base portion connected to the inner surface of the body cover by means of a bolt, the step frame extending in such a manner as to be exposed downward from the lower edge of the body cover; and a plate-like step mounted on an extended portion of the step frame in such a manner as to project sideward from the body. Accordingly, since the plate-like step having a wide step space and being easy in foot rest can be largely extended to a position convenient for a fellow passenger, the fellow passenger can ride on the motorcycle in a comfortable posture.<br>
Moreover, since the step frame is mounted on the body cover, the plate-like step can be removed only by removal of the body cover, which improves workability in maintenance and checking of a power unit and ; the like.<br>
In addition, since the base portion of the step<br>
frame is fixed on the inner surface of the body cover, the<br>
fixing portion of the step frame is covered with the body cover, which improves the appearance performance.<br>
