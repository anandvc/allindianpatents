				<td>TELECOMMUNICATIONS APPARATUS AND METHOD Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to system and methods for communicating internet packet data via packet radio networks, such as, for example, a network operating in accordance with the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). Background of the Invention<br>
The GPRS has been developed to communicate internet packets via a radio access interface. A GPRS network can be formed using a Global System for Mobiles (GSM) or a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) backbone network. GPRS provides support for packet-orientated services and attempts to optimise network and radio resources for packet data communications using for example the Internet Protocol (IP). The GPRS provides a logical architecture, which is related to the packet switched architecture of a mobile radio system.<br>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a body, which is responsible for developing internet protocols for facilitating communications via the internet. For example, a well established internet protocol is the internet protocol version 4 (IPV4) which has been developed and standardised for personal computers to access the internet. The IETF has also developed a further standard known as the internet protocol version 6 (IPV6) which provides an improvement with respect to the IPV4 in terms of facilitating mobile communications and increased addressing options for user equipment. Whilst there are similarities between IPv4 and IPv6, a packet radio network which has been established to support IPv4 will expect internet packets according to the [Pv4 and not IPv6.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications system for communicating internet packet data in accordance with a first internet protocol (IPv6) via a packet radio network operable in accordance a second internet protocol (IPv4), The system comprises a user equipment operable to request a bearer for communicating internet protocol data according to the second internet protocol (IPv4) to and from a gateway support node of the packet radio network. The gateway support node is operable to establish a tunnelling protocol bearer for communicating the internet packet data to and from the user equipment across the packet radio network. The user equipment is operable in combination with the gateway support node to form an address which is compatible with the first internet protocol (IPv6) the address including an interface identifier having a tunnelling end identifier of the tunnelling protocol bearer which ends at the gateway support node of the packet radio network. The internet packet data is communicated to and from a correspondent node via the gateway support node and the established bearer using internet protocol address which is compatible with the first internet protocol (Ipv6).<br>
Systems according to the present invention are arranged to generate an address, which is compatible with a first internet protocol which can be used to communicate internet packet data via a packet radio network which has been arranged to support internet packets data according to a second internet protocol. The address is formed with an interface identifier address component, which includes a tunnelling end identifier acquired from an allocated packet data bearer of the packet radio network. The tunnelling end identifier identifies the end of a tunnelling protocol bearer allocated by the packet radio network. The tunnelling end identifies provides a quasi-unique address within the packet radio network which having been formed into an address which is compatible with the first internet protocol can be used to communicate internet packet data via the packet radio network.<br>
By forming the compatible address with the tunnelling end identifier, the gateway support node can be arranged, in some embodiments, to identify the bearer for communicating the internet packet data from the correspondent node to the user equipment via the packet radio network using the tunnelling end identifier. That is<br>
internet packets are routed from the correspondent node to the user equipment via the packet radio network by the gateway support node using the tunnelling end identifier to identify the allocated bearer. Tunnelling via the packet radio network is thereby substantially automatic. A Traffic Flow Template (TFT) in the gateway support node, which is usually used to route internet packet data to the user equipment using the source address may be by-passed. This is because the bearer which has been established to carry internet packet data across the packet radio network will only recognise internet packets according to the second internet protocol. However the correspondent node will be communicating internet packet data according to the first internet protocol (IPv6). Therefore, for example, the TFT will only recognise an IPV4 address. By identifying the bearer from the tunnelling end identifier the internet packets can be routed via the IPv4 bearer, by-passing the TFT.<br>
In some embodiments the interface identifier may be formed from a combination of the tunnelling end identifier of the packet radio network and a company identifier. The company identifier is used to form an address component of the interface identifier. The company identifier identifies an operator of the packet radio network. In combination with the tunnelling identifier, the compatible address can be provided with global significance. The address can then be used to construct the first internet protocol link-local address and then used by the user equipment to request applications and services within the packet radio network. The compatible address can also be used to request a globally unique and routable address which is formed in accordance with the first internet protocol.<br>
The compatible address may also include a field indicating whether the address is local to the packet radio network or global. If the field is provided with a value, which indicates that the address is local then the gateway support node will not allow internet packets to egress from the packet radio network. However, a value in the field, which indicates that the address is to be regarded alone, may not make the address globally unique. Accordingly, in some embodiments the compatible address may also include a prefix, which is formed in accordance with the first internet protocol. The prefix may be acquired according to the first internet protocol. This is because a UE/host can acquire an IPv6 prefix without necessarily acquiring the full IPv6 address. Hie compatible address which is an IPv6 address, is formed with the<br>
interface ID including the company ID and the tunnel end identifier. The first internet protocol prefix may be acquired from an address allocation server or by receiving the router advertisement messages according to the Neighbour Discovery for IP Version 6 (RFC2461).<br>
In other embodiments, the prefix component of the address may be pre-assigned on a static basis. The user equipment therefore forms the compatible address from the statically assigned prefix and the interface identifier, which includes the tunnelling end identifier.<br>
By combining the interface identifier formed from the tunnelling end identifier and the company identifier with the prefix formed in accordance with the first internet protocol, a globally unique address is provided which can be used to route internet packet data via the external packet data network. This address can be used to identify the user equipment for internet protocol applications according to the first internet protocol. The user equipment can therefore access services, which utilise the first internet protocol, In some embodiments the compatible addressed which is formed is a globally unique address. The user equipment can be accessed therefore via the external (IPv6) packet data network. In other embodiments the compatible address which is not globally unique but nevertheless locally unique can only be accessed within the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) by using the IPv6 link-local address.<br>
In some embodiments, the first internet protocol may be the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6) and the second internet protocol may be the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), The compatible address (that is an address compatible with the first internet protocol) can be arranged to be globally unique, by providing the interface identifier with a prefix address component according to the first internet protocol. In some embodiments the user equipment is provided with the prefix component, the compatible address being formed with a static prefix. In other embodiments the prefix component is acquired dynamically, by acquiring an IPV6 prefix component and forming the compatible address from the interface identifier and the prefix component.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can provide a facility for a user equipment to run application programs which require the use of internet protocol communications according to one internet protocol using a packet radio system<br>
network which has been arranged to communicate internet packets according to a different internet protocol. The packet radio network may be for example a General Packet Radio - Service (GPRS) network.<br>

Description of the Example Embodiments<br>
Embodiments described below provide mechanisms for supporting IPv6 traffic across IPv4 only GPRS/UMTS network. A 3G operator is thereby able to support IPv6 network using an existing IPv4 only UMTS and thus risks associated with an early introduction of IPv6 IMS are minimised.<br>
1.   Example of a GPRS Network<br>
Figure 1 provides a schematic block diagram of a system for communicating<br>
internet packets according to a first (IPv6) internet protocol via a packet radio system network 1 which has been developed to support the communication of internet packets according to a second (IPv4) internet protocol standard. In Figure 1 a user equipment (UE) 2, is arranged to host an application program providing, for example a multimedia service to a user. The application program may require, for example, access to an internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS) such as that developed by the 3GPP to provide multimedia services to users using a UMTS backbone network.<br>
For the present example the packet radio system network 1 is a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network. For simplicity Figure 1 shows elements of a GPRS network which are a GPRS Gateway Service Node (GGSN) 3, Serving GRPS Support Nodes (SGSN) 4, Radio Network Controllers (RNC) 8 and Node B elements 10.<br>
The present technique concerns internet protocol communications between a correspondent node (CN) 12 and a UE 2 attached to the GPRS network 1. The CN 12 is shown in Figure 1 as being attached to a Packet Data Network (PDN) 15, which is connected to the GPRS network. To communicate internet packet data between the CN and the UE a bearer is established across the GRPS network as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In Figure 2, a bearer 14 is established between the GGSN 3 and the UE 2 for communicating internet packets 5, having a header 7 containing an address and payload data 9 to and from the UE 2 and the CN 12. Generally, the GGSN 4 and the SGSN 6 form pails of a core network, CN. For the core network, the bearer is formed by a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) bearer. The radio network controller RNC 8 and the Node B 10 form part of a radio network RN. For the radio network RN, the bearer is formed from a Radio Access Bearer (RAB) tunnelling protocol bearer. The<br>
bearer is arranged to communicate internet packets 16 between the UE and the GGSN. The internet packets have an address 18 and a payload 20.<br>
For the present example, the UE 2 is running an application program, which requires the support of, for example, IMS services. However, IMS has been developed and standardised in accordance with the IPv6 internet protocol standard, whereas the GPRS network 1 has been developed to support IPv4 internet protocol communications. As will be explained shortly, according to the present technique a bearer is established for the UE 2 for conveying IPv6 internet packets via the GPRS network to the CN 12. To this end the present technique is arranged to generate an internet protocol which can be used to communicate via the bearer 14, which is otherwise arranged to support IPv4 communications.<br>
In order to provide an arrangement whereby the user equipment UE can send and receive internet packets in accordance with the IPv6 internet protocol via a GPRS network operating in accordance with the IPv4 internet protocol an address is constructed which can be automatically tunnelled across the GPRS network. Address construction is explained in the following section. More general information concerning the construction of IPv6 addresses is provided in Annex 1.<br>
2.   Constructing the IPv6 Link Local Address for Automatic Tunnelling  across GPRS/UMTS<br>
The present technique utilises a tunnel end point identifier of a GPRS tunnelling protocol bearer to define an interface identifier from which an IPv6 link-local address can be formed. The interface identifier can be used to form an IPv6 compatible address which can be tunnelled automatically by the GPRS network and so is referred to as the GPRS Automatic Tunnelling (GAT) Interface ID. The GAT interface ID is defined using a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol Tunnel Endpoint Identifier which is defined as (TS29.060). The form of the TEID is shown in Figure 3a for data transmission and Figure 3b for control plane data.<br>
Constructing Interface ID using TEID - GAT ID I<br>
A first example of an interface identifier which can be used to form an address which is compatible with IPv6 in accordance with IPv6 Addressing Architecture (RFC2373, Appendix A) uses the TEID in combination with a company identifier. The interface identifier has 64 bits and uses a Modified IEEE EUI-64 format. The<br>
TEID is used to construct the RFC2373 compliant Interface identifier.   The address is constructed as shown in Figures 4a and 4b, where "c" is assigned to the company_id, and "g" is a field providing the individual/group significance. There are two forms of GAT_ID I address, one is a local unique IEEE EUI-64 address as shown in Figure 4a, and the other is a globally unique IEEE EUI-64 address as shown in Figure 4b.<br>
The Definition of GAT Identifier-GAT ID II<br>
A second example of an interface identifier which can be used to construct a IPv6 compatible address uses the IPv4 address allocated as part of a PDF context activation request. Allocations of a bearer and a IPv4 address by the GGSN is described in more detail in Annex 2. In the control plane, GTP specifies a tunnel control and management protocol (GTP-C) which allows the SGSN to provide packet data network access for a UE. Control Plane signalling is used to create, modify and delete tunnels. In the user plane, GTP uses a tunnelling mechanism (GTP-U) to provide a service for carrying user data packets.<br>
The GPRS Automatic Tunnelling (GAT) Interface ID is defined to be the GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier which is defined (TS29.060) combined with the indicator of GAT Identifier (OxFF, 11111111) followed by a 32 bit, IPv4 address of the UE's. Has a local scope because the GAT ID is allocated by the GGSN which manages the sessions with the UE's, it only has local scope.<br>
The TEID is used as a component of the GAT Interface ID (GAT-ID) in constructing the IPv6 link-local address as illustrated in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the first octet of the GAT ID is the GTP type. For GTP for data (GTPJJ), the GTP Type is 16 (00010000). For GTP for control information (GTPJJ), the GTP Type is 17 (00010001). An extra bit, T is defined in this GTP Type octet as the bit "to indicate if the IPv4 address is private or public. Bit "T" is set to 1 if the IPv4 is public and globally unique. Otherwise, it is set to zero.<br>
Transferring TEID's to UE'<br>
So as to construct the GAT_II), the UE must be informed of the TEID of the GTP bearer which is established by the GGSN. In "conventional" PDF Context Activation, the TEID is used for local use within the RNC, SGSN and the GGSN. Due to the need by the UE to construct the interface ED using the TEID, the TEID needs to be passed to the UE's. In a first example the TEID is passed to the UE directly. In<br>
this case the SGSN may choose to pass one or all three pairs of TEID (6 in total) to the UE using the Protocol Configuration Option (PCO) field in PDF Context Activation Accept.<br>
In a second example the GGSN uses one of its TEID to construct an IPv6 address according to its addressing policies and then passes it to the SGSN in the PCO field of the PDF Context Create Response Message. The SGSN in turn, pass this GGSN constmcted IPv6 address to the UE using the PCO field of the PDF Context Activation Accept message.<br>
The Formation of GAT Address<br>
Examples of GAT addresses which may be formed in accordance with the present technique include forming the GAT address from a combination of an assigned IPv4 address and the TEID, and forming the address using a modified EUI-64 address with a GTP TEID. These examples are described in more detail as follows:<br>
Using Embedded IPv4 Addresses<br>
After successful PDF Context Activation, the UE is assigned IPv4 address. So this IP address can be used to construct a IPv6 address in either of the formats shown in Figure 6. The formats shown in Figure 6 are also called the IPv6 addresses that start with binary 0. These formats are intended to be used by the UE for the case where the PDN is IPv4 based and there needs a IPv6 over IPv4 tunnelling across the PDN before reaching an IPv6 domain.<br>
Using Modified EUI-64 approach with GTP TEID to create a unicast addresses (GAT I)<br>
A further example of an address is a modified EUI-64 address, which is an IPv6 unicast link-local address constmcted by adding an address prefix plus the GAT interface ID. A general form of an address formed in accordance with this example technique is shown in Figure 7. For this example, the (network) prefix takes the rest of the 8 bytes. For GATJDJ, the prefix takes 8 bytes. In GAT_ID_II, the network prefix takes 6 byles because the GAT_FD_II uses 10 bytes. There are two possible formats of the general address format shown in Figure 7, which are shown in Figures 8a and 8c.<br>
•	C'ase 1: Global Unicast Address is provided with a prefix, which is a global<br>
routing prefix plus the subnet ID, i.e, the n + m bits is 8 octets. The<br>
acquisition of this addressed is explained in a later section.<br>
•	C'ase II: Site/Link-Local Unicast Address is provided with a format as<br>
shown in Figure 8a for Link-Local Address, and Figure 8b for a Site-Local<br>
Address.  According to RFC2373, an IPv6 packets with site-local or link-<br>
local source or destination addresses must not be forwarded by routers<br>
outside of the site. These addresses are intended to be used for purposes<br>
such as automatic address configuration, neighbour discovery, or when no<br>
routers are present.<br>
In the case of GPRS/UMTS, the two local addresses of Figures 8a and 8b can be used for intra-Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) communications between UE's, i.e. the UE peers are located in the same PLMN and no packets are routed out via the Gi interface to PDN of Figure 1.<br>
Using GAT ID II to Construct a Global Unique IPv6 Address A general form of an IPv6 address, which is created using the GAT_ID_II plus an IPv6 prefix is shown in Figure 9. The advantage of using GAT_ID_II is enabling IPv6 over IPv4 automatic tunnelling where IPv6 is not available such as the case when the packets are going to a IPv4 Packet Data Network via the Gi interface. This is because the GAT ID_II enables automatic IPv6 over IPv4 tunnelling because the IPv6 address has an IPv4 address built-in.<br>
3.   The GAT Tunnelling Procedures<br>
Completing the IPv6 address acquisition<br>
Depending on the choice of the IPv6 compatible address generated, the UE may still need to take further actions to complete the construction of a global unicast address if it is necessary to do so. For example the address may be globally unique but not globally routable. For these cases the UE may use the address that are either requiring a prefix to be global routable or non-routable such as those using the local site/link addresses as described above.<br>
To construct a global routable IPv6 address, after receiving the Create PDP Context Request, the GGSN may perform one of the following operations:<br>
•	Assign a prefix (either locally or requesting from IPv6 DHCP) and then<br>
pass it the GGSN and then from SGSN to UE using the PCO filed in the<br>
POP context messages.<br>
•	Construct the site/link local addresses as shown in Figure 8a and Figure 8b<br>
on the UE's behalf and use it to request a prefix from an IPv6 DHCP. Then<br>
the GGSN may either send the prefix plus the GAT_ID_I or the whole<br>
globally unique IPv6 address as shown in Figure 4a and 4b.<br>
•	Alternatively, the UE's may be statically assigned a prefix, in which case<br>
the UK always knows its prefix.<br>
•	Alternatively, the UE may use the link-local address to listen to the Router<br>
Advertisement  Message  containing  the  prefix   (RFC2461,   Neighbour<br>
Discovery for IP Version 6).<br>
GPRS Automatic Tunnelling of IPv6 Operations (GAT) The GAT tunnel consists of two sections, which are the RAB Tunnel (RAB_T) and the GTP Tunnelling (GTP_T). The RABJT is illustrated by the diagram shown in Figure 10. The RAB_T is between the UE and the RNC and tunnelled through an RLC layer, tunnel endpoints of the RLC entities being within the UE and the RNC, respectively, Effectively, the RLC is the link layer of IPv6 packet. In this case, the IPv6 packet constructed by using the GAT address as its IPv6 address is the SDU of the RLC.<br>
The GTP f is illustrated in Figure 11. The GTP allows multi-protocol packets to be tunnelled through the UMTS/GPRS Backbone between GSNs and between SGSN and UTRAN. The GTP-U protocol is implemented by SGSN's and GGSN's in the UMTS/GPRS Backbone and by Radio Network Controllers (RCN's) in the UTRAN. SGSN's and GGSN's in the UMTS/GPRS Backbone implement the GTP-C protocol. No olher systems need to be aware of the GTP. UMTS/GPRS UE's are connected to an SGSN without being aware of GTP. Figure 11 illustrates the use of GTPJLJ for automatic tunnelling of IPv6 packets, which carry either use data or control/signalling information. Alternatively, GTP_T using automatic tunnelling of<br>
GTP C is used for IPv6 packets carrying network control/signalling data and GTP_T using GTP U is used for IPv6 packets carrying user data.<br>
4.   Summary of Operation<br>
Figure 12 provides an illustrations of systems which operate in accordance with the present technique. As illustrated by Figure 12, the present technique provides an arrangement whereby the GPRS/UMTS bearer as the link layer of IPv6 can carry IPv6 packets using GPRS/UMTS frames. To this end, the UE requests an IPv4 PDP Context as described in Annex 2. The UE may either use a static IPv4 address or it may be assigned a dynamic IPv4 address as a result of successful PDP Context Activation.<br>
Then UE constructs the GAT address according to the definition described in Section 4 and assigns it to at least one (and only one) interface of the UE's. This interface with the GAT address is used for sending internet packets.<br>
In case UE's constructs more than one GAT address by using different GAT interface ID, then the UE can assigns GAT addresses to multiple interfaces, each assigning to only one interface. A GAT address is only assigned once to an interface but an interface can be assigned with more than one different GAT addresses.<br>
Upon activating an IPv6 application (TCP or UDP based), a GAT address is used and the corresponding interface(s) is selected for sending and receiving the IPv6 packets via (he mterface(s).<br>
The operation of the system described above which is arranged to provide a user equipment with an IPv6 at compatible address is summarised with reference to the flow diagrams in Figures 13, 14 and 15. Figure 13 provides a summary of a general procedure performing a compatible address which includes an interface identifier which can be recognised by the GPRS network whereas Figure 14 illustrates a procedure for making the address globally routable by providing a prefix according to the IPv6 standard. The process for forming the GAT interface ID illustrated in Figure 13 is summarised as follows:<br>
SI: User equipment requests a bearer for communicating internet packet data across the packet radio network (GPRS network) by sending a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context request to the GGSN. As part of the PDP context activation,<br><br>
the GGSN activates a bearer across the GPRS network which will of course be a bearer according to the IPv4 standard.<br>
S2: The GGSN receives the PDP context activation request and establishes a bearer for communicating internet packet data between the UE and the GGSN. The bearer includes a tunnelling protocol bearer according to the GPRS tunnelling protocol (GTP) for tunnelling internet packets across core network components of the GPRS network. The bearer also includes a Radio Access Bearer (RAB) for tunnelling internet packet data across the radio access network from the RNC via the Node B elements to the HE.<br>
S4: Either in the GGSN or in the UE, an address is formed which includes an interface ID component and a prefix address component.<br>
S8: The interface ID is therefore formed from the tunnelling end identifier, which identifies the end of the GTP bearer. The address formed therefore has a local significance within the GPRS network.<br>
Optionally in order to make the address globally significant and routable via an IPv6 router, the address needs to acquire an IPv6 prefix. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 14, Figure 14 is summarised as follows:<br>
S10: The UE obtains an IPv6 address prefix component. For example the IPv6 prefix address may be statically assigned to the UE. Alternatively, the link-local address can formed with the interface ID including the tunnelling end identifier to request an IPv6 address from a DHCP server.<br>
SI2: Once the UE has acquired the IPv6 address from the DHCP server, the UE can substitute the prefix from the acquired IPv6 address providing the compatible address with an IPv6 prefix. The UE therefore forms an IPv6 compatible address from the interface ID and the IPv6 prefix address.<br>
S14: The UE can then communicate internet packet data between the UE and the CN using the IPv6 compatible address.<br>
Communication of the internet packet data between the UE and the CN is summarised by the ilow diagram in Figure 16 which will be explained in more detail shortly.<br>
As explained with reference to step S4 in figure 10, the present technique can utilise various options in order to establish a compatible address with the tunnelling<br>
end identifier. The address can be formed within the GGSN communicated to the UE or the address can be formed in the UE from address data communicated from the GGSN. Two options are summarised by the flow diagram shown in Figure 15 for the case where the address is formed within the UE. Figure 15 is summarised as follows:<br>
SI4: GGSN provides the UE with address data for example as part of the POP context allocation, within the PCO field of the PDP Context acceptance. The address data is used to form the interface ID of the compatible address.<br>
SI6: In the first example the GGSN provides an IPv4 address allocated by the GGSN to the UE with the TEID.<br>
SI8: The UE forms the interface ID with the TEID and the IPv4 address. The address formed is therefore globally unique although in order to make this globally routable via an IPv6 network, then the IPv6 prefix address is required as illustrated with respect to Figure 9.<br>
S20: Alternatively the GGSN provides a company identifier with the TEID as part of the address data communicated as part of the PDP context activation. The UE then forms the interface ID from the TEID and the company identifier.<br>
S22: As part of the compatible address, the address includes a global/local user significance field. If the address is to be used only locally within the GPRS network then the significance field is set to zero. Otherwise, if the significance field is to be used globally that is outside the GPRS network then the significance field is set to one.<br>
Figure 16 provides an illustration of a process of communicating internet packet data using the compatible address via the GPRS network. Figure 16 is summarised as follows:<br>
S30: The UE communicates internet packets to the CN using the compatible address via the radio access bearer tunnel and the GTP tunnel which does not otherwise depend on the form of the address in the internet packet header.<br>
S32: For down-link communications the GGSN receives internet packet data from the corresponding node CN. The internet packets are IPv6 internet packets. However, since the GPRS network has been arranged to support IPv4 internet communications, the GGSN will have established an IPv4 bearer. As a result a traffic flow template (TFT) which is used to police internet communications will only<br>
recognise an IPv4 address as the source address of the correspondent node. That is to say, the bearer will have been established with reference to an IPv4 source address. As such the GGSN is modified to the effect that the TFT process is bypassed and the GGSN identifies the appropriate bearer from the tunnelling end identifier TEID.<br>
S36: The GGSN identifies the bearer which is the GTP bearer from the TEID in the interface ID of the compatible address of the UE which is the destination address of the internet packet. Hence tunnelling is made substantially automatic<br>
S38: The GGSN will communicate to the internet packets to the UE via the GTP bearer and the RAB bearer identified by the TEID.<br>
Various further aspects and features of the present invention are defined in the appended claims. Various modifications can be made to the embodiments herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, although the above embodiments have been described for a first internet protocol as IPv6 and the second internet protocol (communication via the packet radio system network) as IPv4, in other embodiments the first protocol may be IPv4 and the second protocol (for communication via the packet radio system network) may be IPv6. Furthermore other internet protocols may be used for the first and second internet protocols.<br>
.   Annex 1: IPv6 Addressing Schemes<br>
These  addressing schemes are summarised in more detail in RFC 3513<br>
"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture".<br>
IPv6 unicast addresses are agreeable with prefixes of arbitrary bit-length similar to IPv4 addresses under Classless Routing. There are several types of unicast addresses in IPv6, in particular, global unicast, site-local unicast, and link-local unicast. There are also some special purpose subtypes of global unicast, such as IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4 address types or encoded NSAP addresses. Additional address types or subtypes can be defined in the future.<br>
IPv6 nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the internal structure of the IPv6 address, depending on the role of the node plays (for instance, host versus router). At a minimum, a node may consider that unicast address (including its own) have no internal structure. An example of this is shown in Figure 17. A slightly sophisticated host (but still rather simple) may additionally be aware of subnet prefix(s) for the link(s) it is attached to, where different addresses may have different values for the subnet prefix(s) which occupies the first n bits, as shown in Figure 18. The address shown in Figure 10 can be used to construct the IPv6 address, called the GAT address, for automatic tunnelling. The interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify interfaces on a link. They are required to be unique within a subnet prefix.<br>
Constructing Interface ID of IPv6 Address<br>
For all unicast addresses, except those that start with binary value 000 (the addresses using embedded IPv4 addresses), interface ID's are required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format (IEEE, "Guidelines for 64-bit Global Identifier (EUI-64) Registration Authority" http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/tutorial/EUI64.htrnl, March 1997).<br>
Modified EUI-64 format based Interface identifiers may have global scope when derived from a global token (e.g. IEEE 802 48-bit MAC or IEEE EUI-64 identifiers) or may have local scope where a global token is not available (e.g. serial links, tunnel end-points, etc) or where global tokens are undesirable (e.g. temporary tokens for privacy).<br>
Modified EUI-64 format interface identifiers are formed by inverting the "u" bit (universal/local bit in IEEE EUI-64 terminology) when forming the interface identifier from IEEE EUI-64 identifiers. In the resulting Modified EUI-64 format the "u" bit is set to "1" to indicate the global scope, and it is set to "0" to indicate local scope. The first three octets in binary of an IEEE EUI-64 identifier are shown in Figure 19. As shown in Figure 19, the address has fields written in Internet standard bit-order, where "u" is the universal/local bit, "g" is the individual/group bit, and "c" are the bits of the companyjd. Examples are provided in RFC3513.<br>
When there is no specific built-in interface identifier is available such as the serial links or the configured tunnels (they are called links without identifiers), interface identifiers must be chosen that are unique within a subnet-prefix.<br>
When no built-in identifier is available on a link the preferred approach is to use a global interface identifier from another interface or one which is assigned to the node itself.<br>
When non global interface identifier is available for use on the link, it needs to create a local-scope interface identifier.<br>
Global IPv6 Unicast Addresses<br>
An example of a global IPv6 uni-cast address is shown in Figure 20.<br>
IPv6 Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses<br>
To facilitate the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, a technique for hosts and routers to dynamically tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 routing infrastructure. IPv6 nodes that use this technique are assigned special IPv6 unicast address with an embedded global IPv4 address in the lower-order 32 bits. An example is shown in Figure 21 which can be described as an "IPv4 compatible IPv6 address".<br>
Another type of IPv4 address is called "IPv4-mapped IPv6 address" which has an address format as illustrated in Figure 22. It can be used to represent the IPv4 nodes using IPv6 addresses.<br>
Local-use IPv6 Unicast Addresses<br>
Two types of local use addresses are illustrated in Figures 23 and 24. These are a site-local address and a link-local address. Site local addresses are designed for addressing inside of a site without the need for a global prefix. The format of the site-local address is shown in Figure 23.<br>
The link-local address is designed for addressing on a single link for automatic address configuration, neighbour discovery, or when no routers are present. The format of the site-local address is shown in Figure 24. There are other types of address such as Any-cast address, multicast address, loop-back address, etc.<br>
6.   Annex 2: IPv4 UMTS Bearer Initiation Using PDF Context Activation<br>
IP traffic (IPv6 or IPv4) is transported across the UMTS network (between UE<br>
and GGSN) across UMTS bearer. A UMTS bearer is described as the establishment of PDF (Packet Data Protocol) Context. A user equipment UE sends IPv4 or IPv6 packets across the UMTS network by setting up IPv4 PDP Context or IPv6 PDF Context. IPv6 PDP Contexts are only supported in a IPv6 capable UMTS network, specifically SGSN and GGSN as well as UE capable of supporting the IP6 related functions (routing, security) in its network protocol stack.<br>
An IPv4 only UMTS network will only support IPv4 PDP Context, although there is no explicit difference between the establishment procedures for IPv4 PDP Context and IPv6 PDP Context. Address management and security within a PDP Context activation are highlighted in the following summary with reference to a flow diagram in Figure 25. The flow diagram of Figure 25 represents equivalently IPv4 for IPv4 PDP Context and IPv6 for IPv6 PDP Context for an IPv6 capable UMTS.<br>
S90: The user equipment UE sends an activate PDP Context Request (NSAPL TI, PDP Type, PDP Address, Access Point Name, QoS Requested, PDP Configuration Options) message to the SGSN. The user equipment UE uses a PDP address to indicate whether it requires the use of a static PDP address or whether it requires the use of a dynamic PDP address. The user equipment UE leaves PDP address empty to request a dynamic PDP address.<br>
S92: The SGSN validates the Activate PDP Context Request using PDP Type (optional), PDF Address (optional), and Access Point Name (optional) provided by the user equipment UE and the PDP context subscription records.<br>
If no GGSN address can be derived or if the SGSN has determined that the Activate PDP Context Request is not valid according to the rules, the SGSN rejects the PDP context activation request.<br>
If a GGSN address can be derived, the SGSN creates a TEID for the requested PDP context. If the user equipment UE requests a dynamic address, the SGSN lets a GGSN allocate the dynamic address. The SGSN may restrict the requested QoS attributes given its capabilities and the current load, and it shall restrict the requested QoS attributes according to the subscribed QoS profile.<br>
The SGSN sends a Create PDF Context Request (PDP Type, PDP Address, Access Point Name, QoS Negotiated, TEID, NSAPI, MSISDN, Selection Mode, Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity, PDP Configuration Options) message to the affected GGSN... PDP Address shall be empty if a dynamic address is requested....<br>
S94: The GGSN creates a new entry in its PDP context table and generates a Charging Id. The new entry allows the GGSN to route PDP PDUs between the SGSN and the external PDP network, and to start charging. The way the GGSN handles Charging Characteristics that it may have received from the SGSN is defined in 3G TS 32.015 [4]. The GGSN then returns a Create PDP Context Response (TEID, PDP Address, PDP Configuration Options, QoS Negotiated, Charging Id, and Cause) message to the SGSN. PDP Address is included if the GGSN allocated a PDP address. If the GGSN has been configured by the operator to use External PDN Address Allocation for the requested APN, PDP Address shall be set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the PDP address shall be negotiated by the user equipment UE with the external PDN after completion of the PDP Context Activation procedure. The GGSN shall relay, modify and monitor these negotiations as long as the PDP context is in ACTIVE state, and use the GGSN-lnitiated PDP Context Modification procedure to transfer the currently used PDP address to the SGSN and the user equipment UE. PDP Configuration Options contain optional PDP parameters that the GGSN may transfer to the user equipment UE. These optional PDP parameters may be requested by the user equipment UE in the Activate PDP Context Request message, or may be sent unsolicited by the GGSN. PDP Configuration Options is sent transparently through the SGSN. The Create PDP Context messages are sent over the backbone network.<br>
S 96: A radio access bearer is set-up in accordance with the PDP activation, including QoS negotiation. The PDP context request is then updated (S97) from the SGSN to the GGSN and the GGSN responds to the update (S98).<br>
S 99: If the user equipment UE has requested a dynamic address, the PDP address received from the GGSN is inserted in the PDP context. The SGSN selects Radio Priority and Packet Flow Id based on QoS Negotiated, and returns an Activate PDP Context Accept (PDP Type, PDP Address, TI, QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id, PDP Configuration Options) message to the user equipment UE. The<br>
SGSN is now able to route PDF PDUs between the GGSN and the user equipment UE, and to start charging. NSAPI (together with TI) is used to distinguish secondary PDF Contexts.<br>
