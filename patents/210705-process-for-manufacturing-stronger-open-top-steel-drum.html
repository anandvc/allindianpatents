THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE N ATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT lS TO BE PFSFORMED:-<br><br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
499/MUM/2004<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the process of manufacturing stronger open top steel drum. More particularly for improving the strength of the open top steel drum while decreasing the weight of steel required to manufacture the drum of the same dimensions and packing capacity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A round open top steel drum is made of steel sheet in various gauges and has the following four components (figure 1)<br>
a.	The body of the drum, which is a cylindrical steel sheet shell, fonned in round<br>
shape and welded normally by resistance welding longitudinally with a<br>
overlap joint It has corrugations but is always provided with two rolling<br>
hoops or bead expanded or rolled in a drum body suitably located. There is<br>
flange at the one end for joining by round seam with the bottom dished end<br>
and top edge of the sheet round curled to suitable diameter.<br>
b.	Bottom dished end, which has a flange.<br>
c.	The top dished end with flange being formed radially, outwardly and is<br>
recessed by pressing suitable form to fit the curled contour of the body and<br>
receive sealing gasket of suitable cross section.<br>
d. A locking ring made of steel sheet is of semi circular cross section with a inner diameter to match the outward dimension of me top end curling and is fixed to secure the drum body against the top dished end and is clamped with a sealing gasket of a suitable cross section in between. There is a nut &amp; bolt tightening system with the locking ring, which is tightened thereby gripping the top dished end and the drum body together wim a gasket in between to make the joint leak proof.<br><br><br>
e. These components are assembled by fixing the bottom dished end on one side of the body shell by folding the flange of shell and the end together with a layer of seaming compound in between. The top dished end (c above) is fixed on top of the body shell in such a way that its curled portion Ins over the curling of the body of the drum with a sealing gasket of a suitable cross section placed in between. The locking ring is fixed to secure and tighten the curling of the shell with the curling on drum end with a gasket in between. The locking ring is tightened in this position to make mis a leak proof joint as the top dished end is squeezed with the drum body curl with the gasket in between to make it a leak proof joint<br>
Accordingly in a open top steel drum there are three joints made during its construction..<br>
(a)	The longitudinal joint on its body, which is resistance, welded to form a<br>
overlap joint<br>
(b)	The bottom round seam which is a joint, made for fixing the body of the drum<br>
with the bottom dished end. This joint is formed by folding the flange on the body of the drum and the bottom dished ends together in the form of double seam, which has five folds, or triple seam with seven folds with seaming compound in between.<br>
(c)	The top round joint where the top dished end is removable. This top dished<br>
end when fixed in the body of the drum and tighten with the locking rings with a gasket in between forms the top joint of the open top drum.<br>
The round seam (b &amp; c above) in a open top drum are comparatively weaker man the longitudinal welded joint on the body of the drum and often fail when under pressure. This invention relates to the section design of the top joint in the drum with the objective of strengthening this joint to bring it as close as possible to the welded body joint efficiency.<br><br><br>
 The objective of this invention is to improve the strength of this design by providing reinforcements which is necessary while downgauging the steel sheet of the drum to achieve better packing economy.<br>
This invention also relates to the strengthening of the body of the drum by providing reinforcements at the points of rolling hoops which is necessary while downgauging the steel sheet of the drum to achieve better packing economy.<br>
A steel drum is made of steel sheet, thickness of which is decided as accepted in the market and standardized to suit it's dimensions, packing capacity and the strength required to withstand the transporting and decanting hazards it has to face while being used for packing a particular material. There is always a pressure from user market to reduce the packing cost per unit of material packed for the same size of drum. This can be done only by reducing the weight of steel required which in turn is possible by downgauging the steel used for its construction. The drawback is that as a gauge of steel used is lowered the strength of the body is reduced.<br>
This invention relates to the method by which strength of the body shell is increased after lowering the gauge of steel normally used for making the drum body.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to reduce the weight of the steel required to fabricate the drum of the size required with increased strength which otherwise gets reduced because of thinner steel sheet used. By doing this, the objective of reduction in the cost of packing per unit of material packed is achieved<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In a open top drum two areas need to be strengthen while downgauging the steel sheets normally used to fabricate it which get weaker and as the steel sheet become thinner.<br>
l.Providing extra reinforcement at the center of the Drum body<br>
This is done by reinforcing both rolling hoops with one or two extra layer of sheet overlapping contour of rolling hoop around the drum. This sheet is in form of a strip or more than one strip folded at edges and enough width required overlapping the contour of the rolling hoop and leaving some extra width on both the sides. The reinforcing strip is curled to a suitable diameter or folded at the ends to avoid sharp edges and at the same time adding strength to the body of the Drum. This strip is folded rounded in a diameter just sufficient to slip over the outside of diameter of the drum and held tight in positioa Thereafter the rolling hoop is either expanded or rolled with mis extra sheet in position, which gives this area of the drum body more thickness resulting in better and additional strength. They are spot welded at places. This is done on both the rolling hoops thereby providing extra support at the center of the body of the drum.<br>
2. Providing reinforcement to the upper joint of the open top dram This is done by<br>
a.	Inserting a rounded sheet in the form of a pipe inside the curling of the drum<br>
body as Shown in drawing. This provides additional strength to the body top<br>
curling (Fig 3)<br>
b.	The top lid dished end is provided with additional layer of sheet in the form of<br>
a   flange one end of which is curled and held in position in a groove at the<br><br><br>
corner of the dished end and held tight and overlapping the dished end curled portion. This flaiige sheet cover the entire width of the dished end curling and other end folded under the curl to hold it in that position. To provide additional safety for firmness of this sheet with the top lid the sheet is spot-welded at different place. This way the area of weakness in the top lid of the drum is strengthen against bulging while providing additional strength to the curling area offering more resistance to opening of the top end cud under pressure. The cornbiaed effect of  modification of two areas in a open top drum results in a tougher joint and body of the drum while downguaging the steel sheet and improves its strength which otherwise gets reduced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
