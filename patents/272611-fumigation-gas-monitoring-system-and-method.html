We, UNITED PHOSPHORUS LIMITED,<br>
a company incorporated under the Companies Act,<br>
1956 and having its registered office at 3-11, GIDC,<br>
Vapi-396 195,<br>
State of Gujarat, India,<br>
INDIAN.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fumigation system and method. More particularly/the present invention relates to a fumigation system and method that enables monitoring and control of fumigation from a remote location.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Crops and agricultural products contain insects and pests, particularly when they are stored for longer periods in storages or silos, which require periodic fumigation in order to control infestation by these pests. Fumigation is one of the most important procedures followed all over the world for infestation control of food and other stored products. The common fumigants employed are phosphine, methyl bromide, 1,3-dichloroprene, chloropicrin, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, sulfuryl fluoride and formaldehyde.<br>
Fumigation usually involves releasing one or more of the fumigants listed above into the closed space to be fumigated and holding a desired level of fumigant concentration in the enclosed space for a predetermined time period to allow the fumigant gas to percolate through the enclosed space.<br>
The effective infestation control during fumigation depends on applying the right quantity of the fumigant gas to the stored products and maintaining a predetermined fumigant gas concentration over the fumigation period. This requires proper fumigant level monitoring instruments which are capable of monitoring the fumigant concentration and correct the gas concentration when required.<br>
Fumigation is nevertheless a hazardous operation and it may be a legal requirement in several countries to maintain proper standards and practices to ensure the safety of the operator handling the fumigation. There exists a need in the art for a fumigation system that enables remote monitoring of the fumigant concentration without posing any operational hazard to the operator.<br>
2<br><br>
Hitherto, such a monitoring system has not been developed which enables the fumigant gas concentration and other associated data to be measured and communicated real-time to an operator located at a remote location.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The various embodiments of the present invention may, but do not necessarily, achieve one or more of the following advantages and/or objects:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a system and method that enables remote monitoring of the fumigant concentration without posing any operational hazard to the operator.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method which enables the fumigant gas concentration and other associated data to be measured and communicated real-time to an operator located at a remote location.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method which is capable of measuring fumigant gas concentration at a plurality of locations within the fumigated location and storing the measured fumigant concentration values on a provided computer memory.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method which is capable to communicating the fumigant concentration data to a remote location over a communication network.<br>
These and other advantages may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and abstract.<br>

Turning now to figure 1, illustrated is an exemplary embodiment of the system according to the present invention. The exemplified system comprises a multi-gas monitor (M), which uses thermal conductivity detector for the detection of SO2F2 (0-100mg/L) &amp; MBr (0-200mg/L) and an electrochemical sensor for the detection of PH3 (0-2000ppm). The monitor is connected to a set of solenoid valves (1) - (7). Valves 6 and 7 are used for selecting the gas to be measured. Valves 4 and 5. are used for isolating the monitor from the silo and for purging the monitor with fresh air. The different sampling locations are selected with the help of the three port solenoid valves (1), (2) and (3) and a manifold (8). All the valves and the monitoring operations are controlled by a micro-controller.<br>
Turning now to figure 2, illustrated is an exemplary embodiment of the method according to the present invention. A system comprising at least a multi-gas monitor, at least a plurality of solenoid valves, at least a manifold, at least a controller and at least a transmission system is provided. The provided multi-gas monitor is switched on at the initiation (time t=0) of the method according to this exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The sampling locations are selected within the fumigated enclosure and the presence of one or more fumigants detected. A preferred fumigant is selcted whose concentration is to be monitored. The multi-gas monitor is purged with fresh air and a sample gas is drawn from the selected sampling location. The selected fumigant gas concentration is measured at the selected sampling location and stored in the multi-gas monitor memory. The above steps from time t=0 are repeated for other selected fumigant gases and sampling locations. The stored fumigant gas concentration data is communicated to a remote location over the internet. The measured value is thereafter compared with a provided lower threshold value. If the measured value is less than the provided lower threshold value, a warning signal is generated and a calculated amount of the selected fumigant gas is pumped into the fumigated enclosure. Else, the measured concentration is compared against a provided upper threshold value. If the measured concentration is found to exceed the provided threshold value, a warning signal is generated and a calculated amount of fresh air is pumped into the fumigated enclosure.<br>
