nylthio, alkenylsulfinyl, alkenylsufonyl, alkynyloxy, alkynylthio, alkynylsulfinyl and<br>
alkynylsulfonyl.<br>
Preferably, the number of substituents is no more than three with the exception of halogen,<br>
where the alkyl groups may be perhalogenated.<br>
In the above definitions "halo" or "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This applies also<br>
to the alkyl, alkenyl or aikynyl parts of other alkyl-, alkenyl- or alkynyl-containing groups.<br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkyl on its own or as part of<br>
another substituent is to be understood as being, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,<br>
pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the isomers thereof, for<br>
example isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or sec-butyl, isopentyl or tert-pentyl.<br>
Cycloalkyl for example is, depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, bicyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, bicycloheptyl,<br>
cyclooctyl or bicyclooctyl.<br><br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkenyl as a group or as a struc¬tural element of other groups is to be understood as being, for example -CH=CH2, -CH2-CH=CH2, -CH=CH-CH3, -CH2-CH=CH-CH3, -CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2, -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, -CH=CH-<ch2 or alkynyl as a group structural element of other groups is for example depending on the number carbon atoms present.></ch2>
A haloalkyl, haloalkenyl, haloalkynyl or haiocycloalkyl group may contain one or more (identical or different) halogen atoms, and for example may stand for CHCI2, CH2F, CCI3, CH2CI, CHF2, CF3, CH2CH2Br, C2CIS, CH2Br, CHCIBr, CF3CH2, CH2CH2CI, CH2CH2F, CH2CHF2, CH2-C=CHCi, CH=CCI2, CH=CF2, CH2-C=CCI, CH2-C=C-CF3, etc.<br>
Bi and B2 characterize bivalent portions of the molecular structure of formula I, which have the function of bridging members. Typically, these portions have a linear structure, but may also be branched and may carry further substituents. Examples include the bridge mem¬bers of the formula -CH(R20)-(CH2)P- , wherein R20 stands for hydrogen or d-d-alky! and p is an integer 0 or 1 for the bridge B2. It may also stand for an Ci-C4-alkylene bridge for example, but also extends to those bridge members which are interrupted or linked via a hetero atom, preferably oxygen or sulfur. Typical examples include -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH(CH3)-CH2-, -CH(CH3)-, -0-CH2-, -S-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, CH(CH3)-CH2-, -S02-CH2-, -CH2-0-CH2-, or CH(CH3)-. Examples for B1 include the linking members -CH2-CH2-, -CH(CH3)-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, CH(CH3)-CH2- , or CH2-CH(CH3)-<br><br>
The presence of at least one asymmetric carbon atom in the compounds of formula I means that the compounds may occur in optically isomeric and enantiomeric forms. As a result of the presence of a possible aliphatic C=C double bond, geometric isomerism may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those possible isomeric forms and mixtures thereof. Where no specific isomer is specified the mixtures of diastereomers or racemat is meant, as obtainable from the synthesis methods.<br>
Preferred subgroups of compounds of formula I are those wherein<br>

Certain mandelic acid derivatives have been proposed for controlling plant-destructive fungi (for example in WO 94/29267 in WO 96/17840 and in PCT/EP01/05530). The action of those preparations is not, however, satisfactory in all aspects and needs of the agricultural practices. Surprisingly, with the compound structure of formula I, new kinds of microbiocides having a high level of activity have been found.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be obtained according to one of the processes of Schemes 1 to 5:<br><br><br>
Step A:      An acid of formula II or a carboxy-activated derivative of an acid of formula II wherein A, Bi, Ri, R2 and Y are as defined for formula I is reacted with an amine of formula III wherein B2, R4 and R5are as defined for formula I, optionally in the presence of a base and optionally in the presence of a diluting agent.<br>
Carboxy-activated derivatives of the acid of formula II are all compounds having an activa¬ted carboxyl group like an acid halide, such as an acid chloride; like symmetrical or mixed anhydrides, such as mixed anhydrides with O-alkylcarbonates; like activated esters, such as p-nitrophenylesters or N-hydroxysuccinim id esters, or even normal esters, such as methyles-ters, ethylesters, n-propylesters, iso-propylesters, n-butyfesters, tert-butylesters, neo-pen-tylesters or iso-amylesters; as well as in-situ-formed activated forms of the acid of formula II with condensating agents, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, benzotri-azol-1 -yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1 -yl-N,N,N',N'-bis(pentamethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-bis(tetramethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate. The mixed anhydrides of the acids of the formula II may be prepared by reaction of an acid of formula II with chloroformic acid esters like chloroformic acid al-kylesters, such as ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, optionally in the presence<br><br>
of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethyiamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-morpholine. The present reaction is preferably performed in a solvent like aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorohydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane or toluene; ketones e.g acetone; esters e.g. ethyl acetate; amides e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide; nitriles e.g. acetonitrile; or ethers e.g. diethylether, tert-butyl-methylether, dioxane or tetrahydro-furan or water. It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. The reaction is perfor¬med optionally in the presence of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-mor¬pholine, like a metal hydroxide or a metal carbonate, preferentially an alkali hydroxide or an alkali carbonate, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at temperatures ranging from -80°C to +150 °C, preferentially at temperatures ranging from -40DC to +40°C.<br>
Step B: The compounds of formula IA may be prepared as final product by reacting a phenol of formula IV wherein A, Bi, B2, R1( RE, R4, R5and Yare as defined for formula I with a compound of formula V wherein R3 is as defined for formula I and wherein Z is a leaving group like a halide such as chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate.<br>
The reaction is advantageously performed in a solvent like aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorohydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane or toluene; ketones e.g. acetone or 2-butanone; esters e.g. ethyl acetate, ethers e.g. diethylether, tert-butyl-methylether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; amides e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide; nitriles e.g. acetonitrile; alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol; sulfoxides e.g. dimethylsulfoxide or water. It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. The reaction is performed optionally in the presence of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-morpholine, like a metal hydroxide, a metal carbonate or a metal alkoxide, preferentially an alkali hydroxide, an alkali carbonate or an alkali alkoxide, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potas¬sium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide or potassium tert-butoxide at temperatures ranging from -80°C to +200°C, preferentially at temperatures ranging from 0°C to +120°C.<br><br>
Step C: Alternatively to step A and step B, an acid ot formula II or a carboxy-activated derivative of an acid of formula II wherein A, B,, Rt, R2 and Y are as defined for formula I is reacted with an amine of formula VII wherein B2, R3, R4 and Rs are as defined for formula I under the same conditions as defined for step A, optionally in the presence of a base and optionally in the presence of a diluting agent.<br><br>
Step D: A compound of formula VIII wherein B2 and R4 are as defined for formula I is alkylated with a compound of formula V (see Scheme 1) wherein R3 and Z are as defined for Scheme 1 under the same conditions as defined for step B in Scheme 1.<br>
Step E: A compound of formula IX wherein B2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I is dehydrated to an isocyanide of formula X wherein B2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I under conditions known perse (D. Seebach, G. Adam, T. Gees, M. Schiess, W. Weigang, Chem. Ber. 1988, 121,507).<br>
Step F: An isocyanide of formula X wherein B2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I is reacted in a three-component Passerini reaction (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry,<br><br>
5th ed., Wiley, 2001, p. 1252) with an aldehyde or ketone of formula XI, wherein A, B, and Ri are as defined for formula I in the presence of a carboxylic acid XII wherein R6 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, typically acetic acid, to give a O-acyl-a-hydroxy amide of formula XIII, wherein A, B,, B2, Ri, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I and R6 is hydrogen or lower alkyl.<br>
Step G: Alternatively to step F, an isocyanide of formula X wherein B2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I is reacted with an aldehyde or ketone of formula XI wherein A, B, and Ri are as defined for formula I in the presence of titanium tetrachloride to give an a-hydroxy amide of the formula XIV (where A, Bu B2, R,, R3 and R4 have the same meaning as defined above) under conditions known perse (D. Seebach, G. Adam, T. Gees, M. Schiess, W. Weigang, Chem. Ber. 1988, 121, 507; O. Ort, U. Doller, W. Reissel, S. D. Lindell, T. L Hough, D. J. Simpson, J. P. Chung, Pesticide Sci. 1997, 50, 331).<br>
Step H: Alternatively to step E and step F, a compound of formula IX, wherein B2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I is treated with one phosgene equivalent (e.g. triphosgene) and a base (e.g. triethylamine) and in a second step, without isolation of the isocyanide intermediate, is further treated with titanium tetrachloride and an aldehyde or ketone of formula XI, wherein A, B^ and R, are as defined for formula I under conditions known perse (WO 96/17840) to give an a-hydroxy amide of the formula XIV, wherein A, B,, B2, Rt, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I.<br>
Step. J; An O-acyl-a-hydroxy amide of formula XIII wherein A, B,, B2, Ri, R3 and R4 are as defined above and R6 is hydrogen or lower alkyl is hydrolyzed to an a-hydroxy amide of formula XIV, wherein A, B1, B2, Ri, Ra and R4 are as defined for formula I under classical conditions (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992).<br>
Step K: An a-hydroxy amide of formula XIV wherein A, B,, B2, R,, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I is reacted with a compound XV wherein R2 is alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl and Z is a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate to a compound of formula IB wherein A, B1, B2, Ri, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined for formula I and under the same conditions as defined for step B in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Step O: Alternatively to step N, a phenol or thiophenol of formula XXI wherein A is as defined for formula I and Q is oxygen or sulfur is reacted with an acetaldehyde derivative of formula XXIV wherein Z is a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate and R8 is hydrogen or lower alkyl to an aldehyde of formula XXV wherein A is as defined for formula I in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide or<br><br>
potassium hydroxide and subsequent acetal cleavage with the aid of an acid like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid under conditions known per se (J. Brussee, W.T. Loos, C.G. Kruse, A. Van der Gen, Tetrahedron, 1990, 46, 979).<br>
Step P: An aldehyde of formula XXV wherein A is as defined for formula I is transformed into a cyanohydrin of formula XXVI wherein A is as defined for formula I with an inorganic cyanide like sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide, preferably in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate or sodium monophosphate.<br>
Step Q: A cyanohydrin of formula XXVI wherein A is as defined for formula I is hydrolyzed to an a-hydroxy-acid of formula XXIII wherein A is as defined for formula I in the presence of an acid like hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or sulfuric acid.<br><br><br><br>
Step U: An amide of formula XXXII wherein A, B,, B2, R,, R4 and Y are as defined for formula I is reacted with a compound XV wherein R2 is as defined for formula I and Z is a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate and which is equal to a compound V wherein R3 is as defined for formula I and Z is also a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate to a compound of formula IB wherein<br><br>
A, Bi, B2, R,, R2, R3, R4 and Y are as defined for formula I and under the same conditions as defined for step B in Scheme 1.<br>
The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbiocidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related fields preventatively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concen¬tration not only by outstanding microbiocidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous microbiocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agri¬cultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups<br><br>
of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distin¬guished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and black¬berries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be mixed with other fungicides, resulting in some cases in unexpected synergistic activities.

In the above mentioned mixtures, the mixture ratio of the active ingredients is so selected that it reaches optional control of the phytopathogenic microorganism on the host plants. This ratio is in general between 100:1 and 1:100, more preferably between 10:1 and 1:10 of a compound of formula I vis-a-vis the second fungicide. The mixtures may not only comprise one of the listed combinational active ingredients, but may comprise more than one additional active ingredients selected from that specified group, thus forming for example 3-way- or even 4-way-mixtures.<br><br>
Suitable carriers and surfactants may be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, such as e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilisers. Such carriers and additives are described, for example, in WO 95/30651.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula I, or an agrochemical composition comprising at least one of those compounds, is application to the foliage {foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application depending upon the risk of infestation by the pathogen in question. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seed grains (coating) either by impregnating the grains with a liquid formulation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula I are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are for that purpose advantageously formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended object¬ives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 1 g to 2 kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from 10 g to 1 kg a.i./ha, especially from 25 g to 750 g a.i./ha. When used as seed dressings, rates of from 0.001 g to 1.0 g of active ingredient per kg of seed are advantageously used.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the com¬pound^) (active ingredient(s)) of formula I and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Further surfactants customarily used in formulation technology will be known to the person skilled in the art or can be found in the relevant technical literature.<br><br>
The agrochemical compositions usually comprise 0.01 to 99 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula I, 99.99 to 1 % by weight, preferably 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 25 % by<br>
weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers, as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects.<br>
