				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an improved process for the production of fly ash slurry. The fly ash slurry finds a vide variety of industrial and agricultural usage such as in building materials, preparation of fertilisers.<br>
Fly ash, a primary product of coal utilisation, is obtained as a fine particulate mineral residue, left behind after all combustibles in coal are burnt out. Its current output rate from steam raising and other plants utilising pulverised coal, is about 10 metric tonnes per annum. Its accumulation without adequate avenues for consumption or disposal otherwise, creates firstly the problem of space for its storage. Secondly, air polluted by its silica particles of less than 10 microns size emitted by boiler chimneys or carried away by prevailing winds from open heaps, causes breathing trouble to human beings. There is a pressing need felt by planners and operators of power stations, to search new areas of its usage, so that the twin problems of its storage and pollution could be mitigated to a considerable extent. Having no easy solution for transportation to outskirts, it is being piled up everyday. The subject of the invention is a method of production of fly ash in water of a high concentration.<br>
The prior art methods of preparing an ash suspension comprises directing dry ash from under dust collecting equipment to flushing apparatus of different types or to ejectors, which are supplied with water at the weight ratio of several times greater that of the ash weight. A large volume of water is required to reduce the surface tension of ash, to achieve full moisturisation thereof and, thus, a suspension. Said suspension of a low concentration is sedimental because it does not have the characteristics of a heavy liquid. It is subsequently fed, along with a portion of slag directly, directly to drag pumps which force it through to the storage yard by<br><br>
pipelines. The hydrotransport apparatus conveying said suspension requires a large volume of water which is obtained by recycling the water from the storage yard by return pipelines.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent no:4618376, wherein a method of continuous production of fly ash in water of a suspension a high concentration of ash with the subsequent addition of slag or granular ash and an installation for the application of this method is described. The production process is divided into subsequent stages and is realized in separate zones of a flow mixer. Ash, slag, water and granular ash are fed in a continuous manner. The drawback is that the process is divided into several zones viz; moisturisation zone, homogenization zone and fluidization zone and stability is not upto the mark. The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of fly ash slurry which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of high concentration, 60% solids loading and above, water based slurry which obviates the drawback of viscosity, stability and concentration.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides, a process for the production of improved fly ash slurry having characteristics as described herein , characterized in that the improved slurry essentially contain ammonium salt of humic acid and tannin extract , said process comprises mixing fly ash and water at a ratio 11:9 and an additive system essentially containing 0.5 to 2 wt% ammonium salt of humic acid and 0.03 to 0.05 wt% tannin extract , agitating the obtained mixture at 140 rpm , at the temperature in the range of 35 to 50 degree Celsius, for a time period in the range of 30 to 45 minutes to get the desired improved fly ash slurry .<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the viscosity of the product may be in the<br>
range of 310-340 mPs at 128 sec'1<br>
The novel feature of the invention primarily relates to a method for producing fly<br>
ash slurry in a single step and product of sufficient stability is obtained at ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
The inventive step of the process of the present invention lies in the additive essentially consists of the mixture of ammonium salt of humic acid and tannin extract<br>
The process of the present invention is explained by means of the following example, which should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
54 gms of fly ash, 45gms water and an additive system consisting ammonium salt of humic acid 1% &amp; 0.05% of tannin extract are subjected to mixing in a mixer, having agitating device, at a temperature of 40 degree Celsius for 35 minutes. Agitation has been maintained at 140 revolutions per minute. The product is discharged at ambient temperature. The viscosity of the product is measured as 330 mPs at 128 sec"1.<br>
Example-2<br>
54 gms of fly ash, 45 gms of water and an additive system consisting ammonium salt of humic acid 1.5% &amp; 0.05% tannin extract are subjected to mixing ina mixer, having agitating device, at a temperature of 45 degree Celsius for 35 minutes.Agitation has been maintained at 140 revolutions per minute. The product is discharged at ambient temperature. The viscosity of the product is measured as 338 mPs at 128 sec-1.<br>
Example-3<br>
54 gms of fly ash, 45 gms of water and an additive system consisting ammonium salt of humic acid 0.8% &amp; 0.05% tannin extract are subjected to mixing in a mixer, having agiating device, at a temperature of 35 degree Celsius for 40 minutes.Agitation has been maintained at 140 revolutions per minute.The product is discharged at ambient temperature. The viscosity of the product is measured as 327 mPs at 128 sec-1.<br>
The advantages of the process are :<br>
1.	The process avoids several stages as compared to the process mentioned in the<br>
prior art.<br>
2.	The product stability of the product is quiet high enabling easy pumpability.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the production of improved  fly ash slurry having<br>
characteristics as described herein , characterized in that the<br>
improved slurry essentially contain ammonium salt of humic<br>
acid and tannin extract, said process comprises mixing fly ash<br>
and water at a ratio 11:9 and   an additive   system essentially<br>
containing 0.5 to 2 wt% ammonium salt of humic acid and 0.03<br>
to 0.05 wt% tannin extract , agitating the obtained mixture at<br>
140 rpm ,   at the temperature in the range of 35 to 50 degree<br>
Celsius,  for a time period in the range of 30 to 45 minutes to<br>
get the desired improved fly ash slurry .<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein improved fly ash slurry<br>
obtained is having viscosity in the range of 310 - 340 mPs at<br>
128 sec1.<br>
3.	A  process  for the  production  of  improved  fly  ash  slurry<br>
