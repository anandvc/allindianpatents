				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a method for drilling a borehole and an apparatus thereof. This invention provides an improved method and apparatus for detennining the trajectory of boreholes to directional and horizontal targets.   In particular, the improved technique replaces the use of a preplanned drilling profile with a new optimum profile that maybe adjusted after each survey such that the borehole from the surface to the targets has reduced tortuosity compared with the borehole that is forced to follow the preplanned profile.   The present invention also provides an efficient method of operating a rotary steerable directional tool using improve*! error control, and minimizing increases in torque that must be applied at the surface for the drilling assembly to reach the target<br>
Background<br>
Controlling the path of a directionally drilled borehole with a tool that permits continuous rotation of the rlrillstring is well established. In directional drilling, planned borehole characteristics may comprise a straight vertical section, a curved section, and a straight non-vertical section to reach a target. The vertical drilling section does not raise significant problems of directional control that require adjustments to a path of the downhole assembly. However, once the drilling assembly deviates from the vertical segment, directional control becomes extremely important.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a preplanned trajectory between a kick-off point KP to a target T using a broken line A- The kickoff point KP may correspond to the end of a straight vertical segment or a point of entry from the surface for drilling the hole. In the former case, this kick-off point corresponds to coordinates where the drill bit is assumed to be during drilling.  The assumed kick-off point and actual drill bit location may differ during drilling. Similarly, during drilling, the actual borehole path B will often deviate from the planned trajectory A. Obviously, if the path B is not adequately corrected, the borehole will miss its intended target.   At point D, a comparison is made between the preplanned condition of corresponding to planned <br>
point on curve A and the actual position. Conventionally, when such a deviation is observed between the actual and planned path, the direcţional driller redirects the assembly back to the original planned path A for the well. Thus, the convenţional direcţional drilling adjustment requires two deflections. One deflection directs the path towards the original planned path A. However, if this deflection is not corrected again, the path will continue in a direction away from the target. Therefore, a second deflection realigns the path with the original planned path A.<br>
There are several known tools designed to improve direcţional drilling. For example, BAKER INTEQ'S "Auto Trak" rotary steerable system uses a closed loop control to keep the angle and azimuth of a drill bit oriented as closely as possible to preplanned values. The closed loop control system is intended to porpoise the hole path in small increments above and below the intended path. Similarly, Cameo has developed a rotary steerable system that controls a trajectory by providing a lateral force on the rotatable assembly. However, these tools typically are not used until the wellbore has reached a long straight run, because the tools do not adequately control curvature rates.<br>
An example of controlled direcţional drilling is described by Patton (U.S.P. 5,419,405). Patton suggests that the original planned trajectory be loaded into, a computer which is part of the downhole assembly. This loading of the trajectory is provided while the tool is at the surface, and the computer is subsequently lowered into the borehole. Patton attempted to reduce the amount of tortuosity in a path by maintaining the drilling assembly on the preplanned profile as much as possible. However, the incremental adjustments to maintain ah'gnment with the preplanned path also introduce a number of kinks into the borehole.<br>
As the number of deflections in a borehole increases, the amount of torque that must be applied at the surface to continue drilling also increases. If too many corrective turns must be made, it is possible that the torque requirements will exceed the specifications of the drilling equipment at the surface. The number of turns also decreases the amount of control of the direcţional drilling.<br>
In addition to Patton '405, other references have recognized the potenţial advantage of controlling the trajectory of the tool downhole.    (See for example,<br><br>
Pattern U.S.P. 5341886, Gray, U.S.P. 6109370, W093U2319, and Wisler, U.S.P,  5812068). It has been well recognized that in order to compute the position of the borehole downhole, one must provide a means for defiringthe depth of the survey in the downhole computer. A variety of methods have been identified for defîning the survey depths downhole. These include:<br>
1.	Using counter wheels on the bottom hole assembly, (Patton, 5341886)<br>
2.	Placing magnetic markers on the formation and reading them with the bottom<br>
hole assembly, (Patton, 5341886)<br>
3.	Recording the lengths of drillpipe that will be added to the driUstring in the<br>
computer while it is at the surface and then calculating the survey depths from<br>
the drillpipe lengths downhole. (Witte, 5896939).<br>
While these downhole systems have reduced the time and Communications resources between a surface drilling station and the downhole drilling assembly, no technique is known that adequately addresses rnimmizing the tortuosity of a drilled hole to a direcţional or horizontal target.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicant's invention overcomes the above deficiencies by developing a nov.l method of computing the optimum path from a calculated position of the borehole to a direcţional or horizontal target.   Referring to Fig. l, at point D, a downhole calculation can be made to recompute a new trajectory C, indicated by the dotted line from the deviated position D to the target T.   The new trajectory is independent of the original trajectory in that it does not attempt to retrace the original trajectory path. As is apparent from Fig. 1, the new path C has a reduced number of turns to arrive at the target     Using the adjusted optimum path will provide a shorter less tortuous path for the borehole than can be achieved by readjusting the trajectory back to the original planned path A.  Though a downhole calculation for the optimum path C is preferred, to obviate delays and to conserve Communications resources, the computation can be done downhole or with normal direcţional control operations conducted at the surface and transmitted.    The transmission can be via a retrievable wire line or through Communications with a non-retrievable measme-while-drilling (MWD) apparatus.<br><br>
By recomputing the optimum path based on the actual position of the borehole after each survey, the invention optimizes the shape of the borehole. Drilling to the target may then proceed in accordance with the optimum path determination.<br>
The invention recognizes that the optimum trajectory for directional and horizontal targets consists of a series of circular arc deflections and straight line segments. A directional target that is defined only by the vertical depth and its north and east coordinates can be reached from any point above it with a circular arc segment followed by a straight line segment. The invention further approximates the circular arc segments by linear elements to reduce the complexity of the optimum path calculation.<br>

In summary, if the direcţional target specification also includes a required entry angle and azimuth, the path from any point above the target requires two circular arc segmente separated by a straight line section. See Fig. 3. When drilling to horizontal well targets, the goal is to place the wellbore on the plane of the<br>
.   formation, at an angle that parallels the surface of the plane and extends in the preplanned direction.   From a point above the target plane where the inclination<br>
angle is less than the required final angle, the optimum path is a single circular arc<br>
segment as shown in Fig. 4.    For all other borehole orientations, the landing<br>
trajectory requires two circular arcs as is shown in Fig. 5.    The mathematical<br>
calculations that are needed to obtain the optimum path from the above Tables 14<br>
.are well within the programming abih'ties of one skilled in the art.  The program can<br>
be stored to any computer readable medium either downhole or at the surface.<br>

It is well known that the optimum curvature rate for direcţional and horizontal wells is a function of the vertical depth of the section. Planned or desired curvature rates can be loaded in the downhole computer in the form of a table of curvature rate versus depth. The downhole designs will utilize the planned curvature rate as defined by the table. The quality of the design can be further optimized by utilizing lower curvature rates than the planned values whenever practicai. As a feature of the preferred embodiments, the total dogleg curvature of the uppermost circular arc segment is compared to the planned or desired curvature rate. Whenever the total dogleg angle is found to be less than the designer's planned curvature rate, the curvature rate is reduced to a value numerically equal to the total dogleg. For example, if the planned curvature rate was 3.5°/100 ft and the required dogleg was .5°, a curvature rate of .5-/100 ft should be used for the iniţial circular arc section. This procedure will produce smoother less tortuous boreholes than would be produced by utilizing the planned value.<br>
The actual curvature rate performance of direcţional drilling equipment including rotary steerable systems is affected by the manufacturing tolerances, the mechanical wear of the rotary steerable equipment, the wear of the bit, and the characteristics of the formation.   Fortunately, these factors tend to change slowly and generally produce actual curvature rates that stay fairly constant with drill depth but differ somewhat from the theoretical trajectory.   The down hole computing system can further optimize the trajectory control by computing and utilizing a correction factor in controlling the rotary steerable system.   The magnitude of the errors can be computed by comparing the planned trajectory between survey positions with the actual trajectory computed from the surveys.   The difference between these two values represents a combination of the deviation in performance of the rotary steerable system and the randomly induced errors in the survey measurement process.   An effective error correction process should nunimize the irtfluence of the random survey errors while responding quickly to changes in the performance of the rotary steerable system.    A preferred method is to utilize a weighted running average difference for the correction coefficients. A preferred technique is to utilize the last five surveys errors and average them by weighting the<br><br>
latest survey five-fold, the second latest survey four-fold, the third latest survey three-fold, the fourth latest survey two-fold, and the fifth survey one time. Altering the number of surveys or adjusting the weighting factors can be used to further increase or reduce the infl uence of the random survey errors and increase or decrease the responsiveness to a change in true performance. For example, rather than the five most recent surveys, the data from ten most recent surveys may be used during the error correction. The weighting variables for each survey can also be whole or fractional numbers. The above error determinations may be included in a computer program, the details of which are well within the abilities of one skilled in the art,<br>
The above embodiments for direcţional and horizontal drilling operations can be applied with known rotary-steerable direcţional tools that effectively control curvature rates. One such tool is described by the present inventor in U.S.P. 5,931,239 patent. The invention is not limited by the type of steerable system. Fig. 9 illustrates the downhole assembly which is operable with the preferred embodiments. The rotary-steerable direcţional tool l will be run with an MWD tool 2. A basic MWD tool, which measures coordinates such as depth, azimuth and inclination, is well known in the art. In order to provide the improvements of the present invention, the MWD tool of the inventive apparatus includes modules that perform the following functions.<br>
1.	Receives data and instructions from the surface.<br>
2.	Includes a surveying module that measures the inclination angle and azimuth of the tool<br>
3.	Sends data from the MWD tool to a receiver at the surface<br>
4.	A two-way radio link that sends instructions to the adjustable stabilizer and receives performance data back from the stabilizer unit<br>
5.	A computer module for recalculating an optimum path based on coordinates of the drilling assembly.<br>
There are three additional methods that can be used to make the depths of each survey available to the downhole computer. The simplest of these is to simply download the survey depth prior to or following the surveying operations.   The<br><br>
most efficient way of handling the survey depth information is to calculate the future survey depths and load these values into the downhole computer before the tool is lowered into the hole. The ieast intrusive way of predicting survey depths is to use an average length of the drill pipe joints rather than measuring the length of each pipe to be added, and determining the survey depth based on the number of pipe joints and the average length.<br>
It is envisioned that the MWD tool could also include modules for taking Gamma-Ray measurements, resistivity and other formation evaluation measurements. It is anticipated that these additional measurements could either be recorded for future review or sent in real-time to the surface.<br>
The downhole computer module will utilize; -surface loaded data, minimal instructions downloaded from the surface, and downhole measurements, to compute the position of the bore hole after each survey and to determine the optimum trajectory required to drill from the current position of the borehole to the direcţional and horizontal targets. A duplicate of this computing capability can optionally be installed at the surface in order to nunimize the volume of data that must be sent from the MWD tool to the surface. The downhole computer will also include an error correction module that will compare the trajectory determined. from the surveys to the planned trajectory and utilize those differences to compute the error correction term. The error correction will provide a closed loop process that will correct formanufactiiringtolerances, tool wear, bit wear, and formation effects.<br>
The process will  significantly improve directional  and horizontal drilling operations through the following:<br>
1.	Only a single bottom hole assembly design will be required to drill the entire<br>
direcţional well. This eliminates all of the trips commonly used in order to<br>
change the characteristics of the bottom hole assembly to better meet the<br>
designed trajectory requirements.<br>
2.	The process will drill a smooth borehole with minimal tortuosity. The process<br>
of redesigning the optimum trajectory after each survey will select the minimum<br>
curvature hole path required to reach the targets.    This will eliminate the<br><br>
tortuous adjustments typically used by direcţional drillers to adjustthe path back to the original planned trajectory.<br>
3.	The closed loop error correction routine will minimize the differences between the intended trajectory and the actual trajectories achieved. This will also lead to reduced tortuosity.<br>
4.	Through the combination of providing a precise control of curvature rate and the ability to redetermine the optimum path, the invention provides a trajectory that utilizes the minimum practicai curvature rates.,This will further expandthe goal of minimizing the tortuosity of the hole.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, one skilled in the art would recognize that various modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
