Azide free process for preparing Neuraminidase Inhibitors R6<br>
The present invention concerns a new multi-step process for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds from 1,2-epoxides, in particular for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds useful as inhibitors of viral or bacterial neuraminidases, as well as specific intermediates useful in that multi-step process.<br>
PCT Patent Publication No. 96/26933 describes a large class of compounds useful as inhibitors of viral or bacterial neuraminidases and their preparation. These compounds comprise a six-membered partially unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, which can be substituted by several different substituents.<br>
PCT Patent Publication No. 98/07685 discloses various methods for preparing compounds of the above class which are cyclohexene carboxylate derivatives. A particularly interesting compound is (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (C.U. Kim et aL, J. Am.Chem. Soc, 1997, 119, 681-690). A method of preparation of that 1,2-diamino compound in 10 steps starting from shikimic acid, or in 12 steps starting from quinic acid, is described by J.C. Rohloffe* aL, J. Org. Chem.,1998, 63,4545-4550. The 10 step method involves a final 4-step reaction sequence from the 1,2-epoxide (lS,5R,6R)-5-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester via three potentially highly toxic and explosive azide intermediates. Dedicated know-how and expensive equipment are required to perform such a process. In a technical process, it is preferable to avoid use of azide reagents and azide intermediates.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,437,171 discloses an improved method for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds from 1,2-epoxides by using allylamine-magnesium bromide etherate to open the epoxide and allylamine-Brensted acid to open the aziridine. Although this<br><br>
new method addresses the azide handling problem, it has a low overall yield from epoxide to final drug substance.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention, therefore, is to find an aside-free process for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds from 1,2-epoxides that has higher overall yield.<br>
That problem has been solved by the invention, as described below, and as defined in the appended claims.<br>
The invention provides a process for preparing 1,2-diamino compounds of formula<br><br>
and pharmaceutical^ acceptable addition salts thereof wherein,<br>
R1, Rr, R2 and R2', independently of each other, are H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyl-lower alkenyl, cycloalkyl-lower alkynyl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclyl-lower alkyl, heterocyclyl-lower alkenyl, heterocyclyl-lower alkynyl, aryl, aryl-lowef alkyl, aryl-lower alkenyl, or aryl-lower alkynyl, or<br>
R1 and R2, R1 and R2, R1' and R2 or Rr and R2' taken together with the two carbon atoms to which they are bound, are a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, or<br>
R1 and R1' or R2 and R2' taken together with the carbon atom to which they are bound, are a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, with the proviso that at least one of R1, Rr, R2 and R2' is not H, and<br>

wherein R1, R1', R2, R2' and R5 are as above;<br>
b)	converting the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (HI) to the aziridine of formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R1', R2, R2' and R5 are as above;<br>
c)	reacting the aziridine of formula (IV) with an amine of formula R NHR ,<br>
wherein R7 and R8, independently from each other, are H or a substituent of an amino<br>
group, with the proviso that not both R7 and R8 are H to obtain a 1,2-diamino compound<br>
of formula  <br>
wherein R1, R1', R2, R2', R5, R7and R8 are as above;<br><br>
d)	acylating the secondary amino group in position 1 of the 1,2-diamino<br>
compound of formula (V) to form an acylated 1,2-diamino compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R1', R2, R2', R3, R5, R7 and Rs are as above;<br>
e)	removing R5 from the acylated 1,2-diamino compound (VI) to produce an<br>
acylated 1,2-diamino compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R1', R2, R2\ R3, R7and R8 are as above; and,<br>
f)	deprotecting the amino group in position 2 of the 1,2-diamino compound of<br>
formula (VII) to produce the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I).<br>
If desired, the resulting 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) can be further transformed into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br>

R   is an optionally substituted alkyl group, R   is an alkyl group and R is a substituent of an amino group<br>
from a cyclohexene oxide of formula<br><br>
wherein R11 and R12 are as above.<br>

The prefeR1'ed meaning for R12 is ethyl.<br><br>
In the compound of formula (VIE), the substituent of an amino group is as defined above. Suitable substituents of amino groups are also described in, e.g., the WO 98/07685.<br>
PrefeR1'ed substituents of an amino group for R are alkanoyl groups, more preferably lower-alkanoyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms such as hexanoyl, pentanoyl, butanoyl (butyryl), propanoyl (propionyl), ethanoyl (acetyl) and methanoyl (formyl). PrefeR1'ed alkanoyl group and therefore prefeR1'ed meaning for R is acetyl.<br>
The prefeR1'ed 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) or 4,5-diamino-shikimic acid derivative of formula (VIE) therefore is the (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester or the (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-cydohex-l-ene-carboxylic acid ethyl ester phosphate (1:1). The prefeR1'ed 1,2-epoxide of formula (II) or cyclohexene oxide of formula (IX) therefore is the (lS,5R,6R)-5-(l-ethyl-propoxy)-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester.<br>

Suitable examples are, e.g., 2-methylbutyl and 2-methylpentyl. PrefeR1'ed amines of formula R5NH2 with the meaning of a straight chain or branched alkyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms group therefore include feR1'-butylamine, 2-methylbutylamine, or 2-methylpentylamine, and more preferably tert-butylamine.<br><br>
The prefeR1'ed amine of formula R5NH2 is terf-butylamine.<br>
The amine of formula RSNH2 is generally used in a molar amount of 1.0 to 3.0 equivalents, preferably of 1.5 to 2.5 equivalents, based on one equivalent of the 1,2-epoxide of formula (II).<br>
Step (a) can be performed without a catalyst under normal or elevated pressure, however, the reaction time of step (a) can be significantly reduced in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Suitably the catalyst is a metal catalyst or a magnesium halide.<br>
Convenient metal catalysts known to catalyze ring opening reactions of 1,2-epoxides with amines are lanthanide compounds such as lanthanide trifluoromethanesulfonates like Yb(OTf)3, Gd(OTf)3 and Nd(OTf)3 (M. Chini et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35,433-436), samarium iodides (P. Van de Weghe, Tetrahedron Lett., 1995,36,1649-1652) or other metal catalysts such as amide cuprate reagents (Y. Yamamoto, J. Chem. Soc., Chem, Commun., 1993,1201-1203) andTi(0-i-Pr)4 (M. Caron etal, J- Org. Chem., 1985, 50,1557 and M. Muller, etal, J. Org. Chem., 1998, 68, 9753).<br>
The ring opening with metal catalysts is caR1'ied out in the presence of an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 20°C and 150°C.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the magnesium halides are the prefeR1'ed catalysts for the ring opening of 1,2-epoxides with amines. The term "magnesium halide derivative" here denotes anhydrous or hydrated magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide or magnesium iodide, or an etherate, in particular a dimethyl etherate, a diethyl etherate, a dipropyl etherate, or a diisopropyl etherate thereof.<br>
Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the prefeR1'ed catalyst.<br><br>
The magnesium halide is suitably used in a molar amount of 50-120 mol %, preferably of 100 mol %.<br>
Suitable solvents for the magnesium halide catalysis are protic solvents such as ethanol or methanol, or preferably an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, teR1'-butyl methyl ether, diisopropylether, isopropylacetate, ethylacetate, methylacetate, acetonitrile, benzene, toluene, pyridine, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, N-methylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide or mixtures thereof.<br>
The aprotic solvent is preferably selected from tetrahydrofuran, diisopropylether, tert-butyl methyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene or a mixture thereof, and more preferably is toluene or MTBE-acetonitrile.<br>
Magnesium halide catalysis is advantageously caR1'ied out at temperatures between 0°C and 200°C, preferably between 25°C and 70°C.<br>
The respective 2-aminoalcohol of formula (ID) can be isolated after the reaction has been finished and if so desired purified by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Step (b)<br>
Step (b) comprises converting the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (IE) to the aziridine of formula (TV).<br>
Because R5 is a straight chain or branched alkyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms as outlined above in step (a), mesylation-cyclization is the major step for the conversion in step (b).<br>
The mesylation-cyclization is caR1'ied out by using a sufonylating agent such as halogenides or the anhydrides of the following sulfonic acids: methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.<br>
PrefeR1'ed sulfonylating agents are halogenides or anhydrides of methane sulfonic acid, such as, methanesulfonyl chloride.<br><br>
The sulfonylating agent is preferably added in an amount of 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 2-aminoalcohol of formula (HI).<br>
The mesylation-eyclization is advantageously caR1'ied out in an aqueous aprotic solvent, such as, methylene chloride or toluene.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably chosen in the range of 25°C and 70°C. Step (c)<br>
Step (c) comprises converting the aziridine of formula (TV) to a 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V) with an amine of formula R7NHR8, wherein R7 and R8, independently from each other, are H or a substituent of an amino group, with the proviso that not both R7 and R8 are H.<br>
The amine of formula R NHR of step (c) is a primary or secondary amine which shows reactivity for opening the aziridine ring.<br>
R7 or R8 in the amine of formula R7NHR8 preferably is a straight chain or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms, optionally substituted benzyl or heterocyclyl methyl.<br>
The straight chain or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms preferably is allyl or an analog thereof, such as, an allyl or allyl group which is substituted on the a-, P-or y-carbon by one lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl group. Suitable examples are, e.g., 2-methylallyl, 3,3-dimethylallyl, 2-phenylallyl, and 3-methylallyl. PrefeR1'ed amines of formula R7NHR8 with the meaning of a straight chain or branched alkenyl of 1 to 6 C-atoms group therefore include allylamine, diallylamine or 2-methylallylamine, and more preferably, diallylamine.<br>
Optionally substituted benzyl preferably is benzyl or benzyl analogs which are either substituted on the a-carbon atom with one or two lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl groups or substituted on the benzene ring with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower-alkoxy or nitro groups. Suitable examples are α- methylbenzj'l, α-phenylbenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, 3-methoxybenzyl, 4-methox3'benzyl,<br><br>
4-nitrobenzyl or 3-methylbenzyl. PrefeR1'ed amines of formula R7NHRS with the meaning of an optionally substituted benzyl group include benzylamine, dibenzylamine, methylbenzylamine, 2-methoxybenzylamine. 3-methoxybenzylamine or 4-methoxybenzylamine, and more prefeR1'ed is benzylamine.<br>
Heterocyclyl methyl preferably is heterocyclyl methyl wherein either the methyl group is substituted with one or two lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aryl groups or the heterocyclic ring is substituted with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or lower alkoxy groups. Suitable examples are furfuryl or picolyl.<br>
The prefeR1'ed amine of formula R7NHR8 is diallylamine.<br>
The amine of formula R7NHR8 is generally used in a molar amount of 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably of 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents, based on one equivalent of the aziridine of formula (IV).<br>
Step (c) can be performed without a catalyst under normal or elevated pressure, however, the reaction time of step (c) can, in general, be significantly reduced in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
If either R7 or R8 is a benzyl group or a benzyl analog, the suitable catalysts can be ytterbium triflate (20 mol %) or lithium perchlorate (1 equivalent).<br>
If R7NHR8 is an aliphatic amine, the suitable catalysts can be sulfonic acid and its derivatives, such as methane sulfonic acid, benzene sulfonic acid and 10-Camphorsulfonic acid (CSA).<br>
The sulfonic acid catalyst is preferably added in an amount of 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the aziridine of formula (IV).<br>
Lewis acid catalysts (10-20 mol%) such as copper (II) chloride, copper (II) bromide, or copper (II) triflate, zinc chloride, zinc triflate, or boron trifluoride etherate are also suitable if excessive diallylamine is used.<br><br>
The prefeR1'ed catalysts are either 10-Camphorsulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid.<br>
The ring opening with sulfonic acid is suitably carried out without solvent at temperatures between 100°C and 120°C.<br>
Step (d)<br>
Step (d) comprises the acylation of the secondary amino group in position 1 of the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V) to form an acylated 1,2-di amino compound of formula (VI).<br>
Acylation can be effected under strong acidic conditions by treating the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (V) with acylating agents known to a person skilled in the art. The acylating agent can be an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, or an activated derivative thereof, such as an acyl halide, a carboxylic acid ester or a carboxylic acid anhydride. Suitable acylating agents are preferably acetylating agents such as acetylchloride, trifluoracteylchloride or acetic anhydride, A suitable aromatic acylating agent is benzoylchloride.<br>
The reaction can be caR1'ied out without catalysts, but the yield is low in the absence of catalysts. The catalysts can be selected from organic bases like pyridine and its derivatives such as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), sodium- or potassium-acetate or from inorganic bases, such as di- or tri-potassium phosphate or cacium oxide.<br>
Preferably, the acylation takes place under acidic conditions using a mixture of 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents of acetic anhydride using sodium acetate or pyridine as catalysts. The preferable catalyst is sodium acetate.<br>
An inert solvent such as tert-butyl methyl ether may be added, it is however also possible to run the reaction without addition of any solvent.<br>
The acetic anhydride is preferably added in an amount of 1.0 to 10.0 equivalents, preferably of 5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 1,2-diamino compound of<br><br>
formula (V). When the amount of acetic anhydride is between 1.5 to 5.0 equivalents, the rate of the reaction increases with the amount of acetic anhydride added.<br>
The temperature is chosen in the range of 70°C to 120°C, the prefeR1'ed temperature is between 100°C and 120°C.<br>
Step (e)<br>
Step (e) comprises removing the alkyl group from position 1 of the acylated 1,2-diamino compound (VI) to produce an acylated 1,2-diamino compound of formula (VTI). As the prefeR1'ed meaning of R5 is a tert-butyl group, the prefeR1'ed process of Step (e) is removal of the tert-butyl group from the acylated 1,2-diamino of formula (VI).<br>
The tert-butyl group of the acetamide of formula (VI) is cleaved by heating in acid, e.g., 2N HC1 at reflux for prolonged period of time.<br>
The prefeR1'ed method for cleavage of the terf-butyl group from the acetamide of formula (VI) is with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at 25°C or with hydrogen chloride in ethanol at reflux.<br>
The TFA is preferably added in an amount of 1.0 to 10.0 equivalents, preferably of 5 equivalents, relating to one equivalent of the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (VI).<br>
The temperature for the reaction using TFA is in the range of 25°C to 50°C.<br>
The hydrogen chloride in ethanol is preferably added in an amount of 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 1,2-diamino compound of formula (VI).<br>
The temperature for the reaction using hydrogen chloride in ethanol is in the range of 50°C to 70°C, preferably at 64°C.<br>
An inert solvent may be added, it is however also possible to run the reaction without addition of any solvent.<br><br>
Step (f)<br>
Step (f) comprises deprotecting the amino group in position 2 of the 1,2-diamino of formula (VII) and, if desired, further transforming the resulting 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt,<br>
Deprotecting the amino group, le.y removal of the substituent of the amino group in position 2 is dependent on the residue R7 and R8,<br>
Because the prefeR1'ed meanings for R7 and R8 are straight chain or branched alkenyl of 2 to 6 C-atoms as outlined above in step (c), removal of the alkenyl group takes place in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, preferably a precious metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd or Rh, either applied on an inert support, such as charcoal or alumina, or in complexed form. Because the prefeR1'ed amine of R7NHR8 is diallylamine according to step (c), a prefeR1'ed catalyst is palladium acetate, and a more prefeR1'ed catalyst is tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium in the presence of 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) which serves as an allyl-transfer acceptor.<br>
For example, the reaction is effectively caR1'ied out with 1 mol % of palladium acetate relating to the 1,2-diamino of formula (VH). Lower charges of the catalyst (0.1-0.5 mol %) also work, but reaction time is longer.<br>
The NDMBA is preferably added in an amount of 0.6 to 1.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the 1,2-diamino of formula (VII),<br>
The removal of the alkenyl group is advantageously caR1'ied out in an aqueous solvent. The solvent itself can be protic or aprotic. Suitable protic solvents are, e.g., alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. Suitable aprotic solvents are, e.g., acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurane (THF), toluene, and dioxane. The prefeR1'ed solvent is ethanol.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 20°C and 70°C.<br><br>
The 1,2-diamino compound of formula (I) can be isolated, e.g., by evaporation and crystallization, but it is preferably kept in, e.g., an ethanolic solution and then further transformed into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt following the methods described in J.C.Rohloff et al, J.Org.Chem., 1998,63,4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.<br>
The salt formation is effected in accordance with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to one skilled in the art.
