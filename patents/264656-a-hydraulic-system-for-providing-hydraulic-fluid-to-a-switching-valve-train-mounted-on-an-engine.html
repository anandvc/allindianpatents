				<td>HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A SWITCHING VALVE TRAIN<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to hydraulic systems, and more<br>
particularly to a hydraulic control assembly for a switching valve train.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Switching valve train systems are a recent innovation used with<br>
internal combustion engines. A typical switching valve train system includes a<br>
rocker assembly that selectively engages an exhaust or intake valve. The rocker<br>
assembly is preferably operated in several modes. Each mode is activated by<br>
hydraulically actuating the rocker assembly.<br>
[0004] An oil control valve, or OCV, is preferably used to selectively<br>
provide hydraulic fluid to the rocker assembly of the switching valve train system.<br>
Locating one or more OCV's within the combustion engine can be problematic as<br>
the OCV's require oil control galleries or passages to feed the OCV with<br>
hydraulic fluid, such as oil, and to then route the hydraulic fluid to the switching<br>
valve train system and then on to a sump in the engine block.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, there is room in the art for a hydraulic control<br>
assembly that provides an arrangement of OCV's and oil control galleries in the<br>
combustion engine that requires a minimum of machining and does not<br><br>
significantly disturb preexisting components within the engine block, cylinder<br>
head, and cam cover.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] The present invention provides an engine having an engine<br>
block, a cylinder head mounted to the engine block, a valve train mounted to the<br>
cylinder head, and a cam cover extending over the valve train and mounted to<br>
the cylinder head. A hydraulic system for providing a hydraulic fluid to the valve<br>
train is included. The hydraulic system has a first passage extending from the<br>
engine block through the cylinder head to the cam cover and connected to a<br>
second passage. The second passage extends along a length of the cam cover<br>
and is connected to an oil control valve. At least one control passage extends<br>
from the oil control valve through the cam cover to the valve train. The oil control<br>
valve is mounted to a port in the cam cover and extends into the cam cover in a<br>
direction along a width and a height of the cam cover.<br>
[0007] In a first aspect of the present invention, the port is located on<br>
an outer surface of the cam cover.<br>
[0008] In another aspect of the present invention, the first passage and<br>
the second passage are integrally formed in the cam cover between a smooth<br>
inner surface and a smooth outer surface.<br>
[0009] In still another aspect of the present invention, the oil control<br>
valve extends along the width in a direction outward from a center of the engine.<br><br>
[0010] In still another aspect of the present invention, the second<br>
passage is horizontal.<br>
[0011] In still another aspect of the present invention, the engine<br>
further includes a second oil control valve mounted to a second port in the cam<br>
cover, the second oil control valve aligned with the first oil control valve and<br>
spaced from the first oil control valve along the length of the cam cover.<br>
[0012] In still another aspect of the present invention, the first passage<br>
connects to the second passage between the first oil control valve and the<br>
second oil control valve.<br>
[0013] In still another aspect of the present invention, the valve train<br>
includes a hydraulic lash adjuster, and the control passage connects with the<br>
hydraulic lash adjuster to provide the hydraulic fluid to the valve train.<br>
[0014] In still another aspect of the present invention, the engine<br>
further includes a second control passage extending from the oil control valve to<br>
an interface between the cam cover and the cylinder head.<br>
[0015] In still another aspect of the present invention, the engine<br>
further includes a third control passage connected to the second control passage<br>
and extending to a first hydraulic lash adjuster in the valve train.<br>
[0016] In still another aspect of the present invention, the engine<br>
further includes a second valve train having a second lash adjuster, and the<br>
hydraulic system includes a third control passage connected between the second<br>
control passage and the second hydraulic lash adjuster.<br><br>
[0017] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0023] With reference to FIG. 1, a schematic diagram of an exemplary<br>
internal combustion engine is indicated by reference number 10. The engine 10<br>
includes a switching valve train system, as will be described in greater detail<br><br>
below, used to variably actuate a plurality of intake and exhaust valves. While<br>
the engine is illustrated as a "V"-type engine, it should be appreciated that the<br>
engine 10 may take various forms, including an inline engine, without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention. The engine 10 defines a horizontal or<br>
longitudinal axis, indicated by reference number 11, along the length of the<br>
engine 10, a vertical axis, indicated by reference number 13, along the height of<br>
the engine 10, and a span axis, indicated by reference number 15, along the<br>
width of the engine 10. The engine 10 generally includes an engine block 12, a<br>
cylinder head 14, and at least one valve or cam cover 16. The engine block 12<br>
houses a plurality of engine components including a plurality of combustion<br>
cylinders (not shown). The cylinder head 14 is located over top the engine block<br>
12 and caps the combustion cylinders, as well as houses the intake and exhaust<br>
valves of a typical internal combustion engine. The cam cover 16 fits over top at<br>
least a portion of the cylinder head 14 and protects any engine components<br>
underneath the cam cover 16 from outside interference or damage.<br>
[0024] With reference to FIG. 2, a cross-sectional portion of the engine<br>
10 is illustrated. The engine 10 includes an exhaust switching valve train system,<br>
indicated by reference number 20, mounted to the cylinder head 14. The valve<br>
train 20 generally includes an exhaust valve 22, a rocker arm assembly 24, and a<br>
camshaft 26. The exhaust valve 22 extends through the cylinder head 14 and<br>
into one of the cylinders (not shown) of the engine 10 within the engine block 12.<br>
The exhaust valve 22 is operable to selectively open, vary the opening height,<br>
and close to allow exhaust to exit the cylinder.<br><br>
[0025] The camshaft 26 is mounted to the cylinder head 14 by a cam<br>
cap 28. The camshaft 26 includes a plurality of cams 30, only one of which is<br>
shown. The rocker arm assembly 24 is located beneath the camshaft 26 and is<br>
coupled to the exhaust valve 22 at one end and coupled to the cylinder head 14<br>
at an opposite end by a hydraulic lash adjuster 32. The camshaft 26 is operable<br>
to engage the rocker arm assembly 24 to selectively open, vary the opening<br>
height, and close the exhaust valve 22.<br>
[0026] The engine 10 also includes an intake switching valve train<br>
system, indicated by reference number 40, mounted to the cylinder head 14.<br>
The valve train 40 generally includes an intake valve 42, a rocker arm assembly<br>
44, and a camshaft 46. The intake valve 42 extends through the cylinder head<br>
14 and into one of the cylinders (not shown) of the engine 10 within the engine<br>
block 12. The intake valve 42 is operable to selectively open, vary the opening<br>
height, and close to allow intake air to enter the cylinder.<br>
[0027] The camshaft 46 is mounted to the cylinder head 14 by a cam<br>
cap 48. The camshaft 46 includes a plurality of cams 50, only one of which is<br>
shown. The rocker arm assembly 44 is located beneath the camshaft 46 and is<br>
coupled to the intake valve 42 at one end and coupled to the cylinder head 14 at<br>
an opposite end by a hydraulic lash adjuster 52. The camshaft 46 is operable to<br>
engage the rocker arm assembly 44 to selectively open, vary the opening height,<br>
and close the intake valve 42. While only a single intake valve 42 and exhaust<br>
valve 22 are shown, it should be appreciated that any number of intake valves<br><br>
and exhaust valves with corresponding valve trains may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0028] With combined reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the engine 10<br>
further includes a hydraulic control system, generally indicated by reference<br>
number 100. The hydraulic control system 100 is operable to transport a<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid, such as oil, from a fluid source (not shown) through<br>
the engine 10 to various components, including the valve trains 20 and 40. The<br>
hydraulic control system 100 includes a supply gallery or passage 102. The<br>
supply passage 102 extends from the engine block 12 through the cylinder head<br>
14 and into the cam cover 16. The supply passage 102 is connected to an oil<br>
supply (not shown) in the engine block 12 and connected at an opposite end to a<br>
main oil gallery or passage 104 in the cam cover. The main oil passage 104 is<br>
formed integrally into the cam cover 16 and extends generally horizontally<br>
parallel to reference line 11 (FIG. 1) along the length of the cam cover 16. The<br>
main oil passage 104 is located between a smooth outer surface 61 of the cam<br>
cover and a smooth inner surface 63 of the cam cover.<br>
[0029] A first oil control valve (OCV) 106 and a second oil control valve<br>
(OCV) 108 are connected to the main oil passage 104. While two OCV's 106,<br>
108 are shown in the example provided, it should be appreciated that any<br>
number of OCV's 106, 108 may be employed without departing from the scope of<br>
the present invention. The OCV's 106, 108 are in electronic communication with<br>
a controller (not shown). The OCV's 106, 108 are employed to control the<br>
amount or pressure of the hydraulic fluid or oil passing through the OCV's 106,<br><br>
108 from the main oil passage 104 according to signals sent from the controller,<br>
as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0030] Each OCV 106, 108 is mounted to the cam cover 16. More<br>
specifically, the cam cover 16 includes a pair of mounting ports 60 formed on the<br>
outer surface 61 of the cam cover 16. The mounting ports 60 are sized to<br>
receive at least a portion of the OCV's 106, 108 therein. The OCV's 106, 108<br>
and the mounting ports 60 each define a common longitudinal axis, indicated by<br>
reference number 65. The axes 65 of the OCV's 106, 108 are oriented such that<br>
they extend into the cam cover 16 in a direction outwards from a center of the<br>
engine 10 along the span axis 15 perpendicular to the vertical axis 13. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, the OCV's 106, 108 may also extend downwards from a<br>
top of the engine 10 along the vertical axis 13. In other words, the axes 65 of the<br>
OCV's 106, 108 are oriented in the alternate embodiment such that they are<br>
perpendicular to a reference line parallel to the longitudinal axis 11 and at an<br>
angle with respect to the vertical axis 13 and the span axis 15. As best seen in<br>
FIG. 3, the OCV's 106, 108 are spaced apart along the length of cam cover 16<br>
and the main oil passage 104 such that the supply passage 102 connects to the<br>
main oil passage 104 at a location between the OCV 106 and the OCV 108.<br>
[0031] The hydraulic control system 100 further includes a plurality of<br>
control galleries or passages located within the cam cover 16 and cylinder head<br>
14 to route the hydraulic fluid from the OCV's 106, 108 to respective valve trains<br>
20, 40. In the particular example provided, each OCV 106, 108 is operable to<br>
control the hydraulic fluid pressure to a set of intake and exhaust valve trains.<br><br>
Accordingly, the OCV 106 controls the pressurized fluid to both the intake valve<br>
train 20 and the exhaust valve train 40 illustrated in the example provided.<br>
However, it should be appreciated that separate OCV's may be used to control<br>
separate intake and exhaust valves without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention. More specifically, a first control gallery or passage 110 is<br>
connected to the first OCV 106. The first control passage 110 receives the<br>
regulated pressurized fluid from the OCV 106. The first control passage 110 is<br>
formed integrally with the cam cover 16 between the inner surface 63 and the<br>
outer surface 61 and runs approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis 65 of the<br>
OCV 106. The first control passage 110 is connected at an end thereof to a<br>
second control passage 112. The second control passage 112 is also formed<br>
integrally with the cam cover 16 between the inner surface 63 and the outer<br>
surface 61 and runs at an angle with respect to the vertical axis 13. Both the first<br>
passage 110 and the second passage 112 approximately follow the contour of<br>
the outer surface 61 and the inner surface 63 of the cam cover 16. Additionally,<br>
both the first passage 110 and the second passage 112 can be considered a<br>
single passage integrally formed with the cam cover 16 without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0032] The second control passage 112 connects with a third control<br>
passage 114. The third control passage 114 is formed integrally with the cylinder<br>
head 14. The connection between the second control passage 112 and the third<br>
control passage 114 corresponds to the interface between the cam cover 16 and<br>
the cylinder head 14. The third control passage 114 extends at an angle with<br><br>
respect to the second control passage 112 and the vertical axis 13 and connects<br>
to a second supply gallery or passage 116.<br>
[0033] The second supply passage 116 is integrally formed with the<br>
cylinder head 14 and extends approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis 11<br>
along the length of the cylinder head 14. The second supply passage 116<br>
connects with the hydraulic lash adjuster 52 of the intake valve train 40.<br>
Accordingly, pressurized hydraulic fluid is provided to the OCV 106 through the<br>
supply passage 102 and the main supply passage 104 from a pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid source (not shown). The OCV 106 is then controlled to selectively<br>
regulate the pressure of the hydraulic fluid therethrough. The regulated hydraulic<br>
fluid from the OCV 106 is channeled through the control passages 110, 112, 114,<br>
and 116 to the hydraulic lash adjuster 52, thereby providing regulated hydraulic<br>
fluid to the intake valve train 40.<br>
[0034] A fourth control gallery or passage 118 is connected to the<br>
second supply passage 116 and extends towards the valve train 20. A fifth<br>
control gallery or passage 120 is connected to the fourth control passage 118.<br>
The fifth control passage 120 connects with the hydraulic lash adjuster 32 in the<br>
exhaust valve train 20. Accordingly, regulated hydraulic fluid from the OCV 106<br>
is channeled through the control passages 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, and 120 to<br>
the hydraulic lash adjuster 32, thereby providing regulated hydraulic fluid to the<br>
exhaust valve train 20. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the third<br>
passage 114, the second supply passage 116, the fourth passage 118, and the<br><br>
fifth passage 120 can be considered a single passage integrally formed in the<br>
cylinder head 14 without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0035] The control passages connected to the second OCV 108 are<br>
substantially similar to the control passages connected to the first OCV 106 and<br>
include passages 110, 112 integrally formed in the cam cover 16 and passages<br>
114, 116, 118, and 120 integrally formed in the cylinder head 14. Additionally,<br>
while in the particular example provided the hydraulic control system 100 is<br>
connected to both the intake and exhaust valve trains 40, 20, it should be<br>
appreciated that only one of either the intake valve train 40 or the exhaust valve<br>
train 20 may be coupled to the hydraulic control system 100 without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0036] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
