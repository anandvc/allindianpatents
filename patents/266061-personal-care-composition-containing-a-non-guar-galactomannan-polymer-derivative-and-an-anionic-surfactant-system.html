				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to personal care compositions comprising a galactomannan polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of 5: 1. More particularly, the present invention relates to personal care compositions comprising a particular anionic surfactant system and a cationic or amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of 5: 1. In one aspect, the present invention relates to personal care compositions as described above which further comprise one or more conditioning agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Personal care compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactants and conditioning agents are known. These products typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These products have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair or skin conditioning and cleansing performance all from a single personal care product.<br>
Many personal care compositions, though, do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair and skin during the cleansing process. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the cleansing process, and, therefore, provide little or no conditioning benefit. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair and skin, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal care composition to provide adequate conditioning performance. However, high levels of a conditioning agent can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns.<br>
Obtaining good deposition of a conditioning agent is further complicated by the action of detersive surfactants in the personal care composition. Detersive surfactants are designed to carry away or remove oil, grease, dirt, and particulate matter from the hair and skin. As a result, the detersive surfactants can interfere with deposition of the <br>
conditioning agent and can remove both deposited and non-deposited conditioning agent during rinsing. Consequently, after rinsing, the deposition of the conditioning agent onto the hair and skin is reduced, which, in rum, reduces conditioning performance. Therefore, to achieve desired conditioning performance with a given conditioning agent, a specific anionic surfactant system may be needed for use in combination with the given conditioning agent.<br>
One method for improving deposition of a conditioning agent involves the use of certain cationic deposition polymers. Commonly used cationic deposition polymers include natural polymers, such as guar gum polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents. Guar gum polymers are galactomannans containing two mannose monomers with a glycoside linkage and one galactose monomer attached to a hydroxyl group of the mannose monomers (i.e., guar gum polymers have a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 : 1 on a monomer to monomer basis). Selecting a cationic guar deposition polymer with sufficient charge density and molecular weight, in combination with an optimized surfactant system, results in sufficient deposition of conditioning agents. However, to achieve this sufficient deposition of conditioning agents in shampoo or body wash compositions using a cationic guar polymer, a relatively high level of such cationic guar polymer generally must be deposited on the hair or skin. Moreover, the cost of such cationic guar polymer is relatively high. As a result, incorporation of cationic guar polymer can add to the manufacturing costs of such personal cleansing compositions.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a personal cleansing composition which delivers superior conditioning benefits to hair and/or skin, without a reduced cleansing performance, through relatively low deposition of an inexpensive cationic or amphoteric polymer in combination with a particular anionic surfactant system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a cationic galactomannan polymer, an anionic surfactant system, and an aqueous carrier. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of. The compositions and methods/processes of the present invention can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.<br>
All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as<br><br>
they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified. The term "weight percent" may be denoted as "wt.%" herein.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "charge density", as used herein, refers to the ratio of the number of net positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. The charge density multiplied by the polymer molecular weight determines the number of positively charged sites on a given polymer chain.<br>
The term "polymer" as used herein shall include materials whether made by polymerization of one type of monomer or made by two (i.e., copolymers) or more types of monomers.<br>
The term "water-soluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at 25 °C at a concentration of at least 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at least 1%, more preferably at least 5%, most preferably at least 15%.<br>
The term "water-insoluble" as used herein, means that a compound is not soluble in water in the present composition. Thus, the compound is not miscible with water.<br>
The term "particle size" as used herein refers to the average mean particle size of a group of particles in the final composition of the present invention. For opaque compositions and/or those containing small to large sized particles (i.e., about 100 nm to about 50 urn), particle size may be measured by means of a laser light scattering technique, using a Horiba model LA 910 Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer (Horiba Instruments, Inc. Irvine, California, USA). For substantially clear compositions and/or those containing nano sized particles (i.e., less than about 100 nm), particle size may be measured by means of a dynamic light scattering controlled reference method (i.e., which uses a heterodyne detection technique), using a <br>
Microtrac® model UFA 150 Ultrafine Particle Size Analyzer (Honeywell, Inc., Industrial Automation and Control, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA).<br>
The transparency of the composition is measured by Ultra-Violet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of UV/VIS light by a sample. A light wavelength of 600 nm has been shown to be adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of non-colored cosmetic compositions.<br>
A. Galactomannan Polymer Derivative<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise galactomannan polymer derivatives having a mannose to galactose ratio of 5: 1 on a monomer to monomer basis, the galactomannan polymer derivative selected from the group consisting of a cationic galactomannan polymer derivative and an amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a net positive charge. As used herein, the term "cationic galactomannan" refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group is added. The term "amphoteric galactomannan" refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added such that the polymer has a net positive charge.<br>
Galactomannan polymers are present in the endosperm of seeds of the Leguminosae family. Galactomannan polymers are made up of a combination of mannose monomers and galactose monomers. The galactomannan molecule is a straight chain mannan branched at regular intervals with single membered galactose units on specific mannose units. The mannose units are linked to each other by means of P (1-4) glycosidic linkages. The galactose branching arises by way of an a (1-6) linkage. The ratio of mannose monomers to galactose monomers varies according to the species of the plant and also is affected by climate. Guar is an example of one type of a galactomannan polymer, specifically having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 monomers of mannose to 1 monomer of galactose. Galactomannan polymers of the present invention have a ratio of mannose to galactose of 5: 1 on a monomer to monomer basis (i.e., non-guar galactomannan polymers). Analysis of mannose to galactose ratios is well known in the art and is typically based on the measurement of the galactose content.<br>
The gum for use in preparing the non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives is typically obtained as naturally occurring material such as seeds or beans from plants. Examples of various non-guar galactomannan polymers include but are not limited to Tara gum (3 parts mannose /l part galactose), Locust bean or Carob (4 parts mannose /l part galactose), and Cassia gum (5 parts mannose /l part galactose). <br>
The cationic galactomannan polymer derivatives for use in the personal care compositions of the present invention have a molecular weight from about 1,000 to about 10,000,000. In one embodiment of the present invention, the cationic galactomannan polymer derivatives have a molecular weight from about 5,000 to about 3,000,000. As used herein, the term "molecular weight" refers to the weight average molecular weight. The weight average molecular weight may be measured by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention include galactomannan polymer derivatives which have a cationic charge density from about 0.7 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. In one embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivatives have a charge density from about 0.9 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. The degree of substitution of the cationic groups onto the galactomannan structure should be sufficient to provide the requisite cationic charge density.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivative is a cationic derivative of the non-guar galactomannan polymer, which is obtained by reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the galactomannan polymer and reactive quaternary ammonium compounds. Suitable quaternary ammonium compounds for use in forming the cationic galactomannan polymer derivatives include those conforming to the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein where R1, R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl groups; R4 is either an epoxyalkyl group of the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)or R4 is a halohydrin group of the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein R5 is a C1 to C3 alkylene; X is chlorine or bromine, and Z is an anion such as Cl", Br, I- or HSO4'.<br>
Cationic non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives formed from the reagents described above are represented by the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein R is the gum. Preferably, the cationic galactomannan derivative is a gum hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride, which can be more specifically represented by the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)In another embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivative is an amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a net positive charge, obtained when the cationic galactomannan polymer derivative further comprises an anionic group.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise galactomannan polymer derivatives at a range of about 0.01% to about 10%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. B.       Anionic Surfactant System - Ethoxylate Level and Anion Level<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise an anionic surfactant system. The anionic surfactant system is included to provide cleaning performance to the composition. The anionic surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant, and optionally an amphoteric surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics, or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactant components for use in the personal care composition herein include those that are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant system in the personal care<br>
composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally ranges from about 5% to about 35%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In considering the performance characteristics of a personal care composition, such as wet conditioning performance, dry conditioning performance, and conditioning ingredient deposition on hair, it is necessary to optimize the levels and types of surfactant in order to maximize the performance potential of polymer systems. The anionic surfactant system for use in the personal care compositions of the present invention has an ethoxylate level and an anion level, wherein the ethoxylate level is from about 1 to about 6, and wherein the anion level is from about 1.5 to about 6, both as calculated below.<br>
An optimal ethoxylate level can be calculated based on the stoichiometry of the surfactant structure, which in turn is based on a particular molecular weight of the surfactant where the number of moles of ethoxylation is known. Likewise, given a specific molecular weight of a surfactant and an anionization reaction completion measurement, the anion level can be calculated. Analytical techniques have been developed to measure ethoxylation or anionization within surfactant systems. The Level of Ethoxylate and the Level of Anion (both molar levels) representative of a particular surfactant system are calculated from the percent ethoxylation and percent anion of individual surfactants in the following manner:<br>
Level of Ethoxylate in a composition = percent ethoxylation multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition).<br>
Level of Anion in a composition = percent anion in ethoxylated surfactant multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition) plus percent anion in non-ethoxylated surfactant multiplied by percent active non-ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the composition).<br>
I<br>
If a composition comprises two or more surfactants having different respective anions (e.g., surfactant A has a sulfate group and surfactant B has a sulfonate group), the Level<br>
of Anion in the composition is the sum of the molar levels of each respective anion as calculated above.<br>
Sample Calculation:<br>
Example 1 shows an ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.294321% ethoxylate and 0.188307% sulfate as the anion and a non-ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.266845% sulfate as an anion. Both surfactants are 29% active.<br>
Level of Ethoxylate in Example 1 = 0.294321 multiplied by 7 (% active ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Ethoxylate in the composition of Example 1 is approximately 2.06.<br>
Level of Anion in Example 1 = 0.188307 multiplied by 7 (% active ethoxylated surfactant) plus 0.266845 multiplied by 7 (% active non-ethoxylated surfactant).  Thus, the Level of Anion in the composition of   . Example 1 is approximately 3.19.<br>
The anionic surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant comprising an anion selected from the group consisting of sulfates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, isethionates, carboxylates, phosphates, and phosphonates. Preferably, the anion is a sulfate.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants suitable for use in the personal care compositions are alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates. These materials have the respective formulae ROSO3M and RO(C2H4O)XSC&gt;3M, wherein R is alkyl or alkenyl of from about 8 to<br>
about 18 carbon atoms, x is an integer having a value of from about 1 to about 10, and M is a cation such as ammonium, an alkanolamine such as triethanolamine, a monovalent metal such as sodium and potassium, or a polyvalent metal cation such as magnesium and calcium. Solubility of the surfactant will depend upon the particular anionic surfactants and cations chosen.<br>
Preferably, R has from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, even more preferably from about 12 to about 14<br>
carbon atoms, in both the alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates. The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms. The alcohols can be synthetic or they can be derived from fats, e.g., coconut oil, palm kernel oil, tallow. Lauryl alcohol and straight chain alcohols derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil are preferred. Such alcohols are reacted with from about 0 to about 10, preferably from about 2 to about 5, more preferably about 3, molar proportions of ethylene .oxide, and the resulting mixture of molecular species having, for example, an average of 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol is sulfated and neutralized.<br>
Specific non-limiting examples of alkyl ether sulfates which may be used in the personal care compositions of the present invention include sodium and ammonium salts of coconut alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, tallow alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, and tallow alkyl hexa-oxyethylene sulfate. Highly preferred alkyl ether sulfates are those comprising a mixture of individual compounds, wherein the compounds in the mixture have an average alkyl chain length of from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms and an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 1 to about 4 moles of ethylene oxide. Such a mixture also comprises from about 0% to about 20% by weight  compounds; from about 60% to about 100% by weight of  compounds; from about 0% to about 20% by weight of  compounds; from about 3% to about 30% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of 0; from about 45% to about 90% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation from about 1 to about 4; from about 10% to about 25% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation from about 4 to about 8; and from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation greater than about 8.<br>
Another suitable class of anionic surfactants are the water-soluble salts of the organic, sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula Ri-SOa-M wherein RI is chosen from the group consisting of a straight or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydro-carbon radical having from 8 to 24, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms; and M is a cation. Important examples are the salts of an organic sulfuric acid reaction product of a hydrocarbon of the methane series, including iso-, neo-, ineso-, and n-paraffins, having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms, and a sulfonating agent e.g.,<br>
H2SO4, oleum, obtained according to known sulfonation methods, including bleaching and hydrolysis. Preferred are alkali metal and ammonium sulfonated C^-is-n-paraffins.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants for use in the personal care compositions include ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate, triethylamine lauryl sulfate, triethylamine laureth sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, monoethanolamine lauryl sulfate, monoethanolamine laureth sulfate, diethanolamine lauryl sulfate, diethanolamine laureth sulfate, lauric monoglyceride sodium sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, potassium lauryl sulfate, potassium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, lauryl sarcosine, cocoyl sarcosine, ammonium cocoyl sulfate, ammonium lauroyl sulfate, sodium cocoyl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sulfate, potassium cocoyl sulfate, potassium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, monoethanolamine cocoyl sulfate, monoethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and combinations thereof.<br>
Still other suitable anionic surfactants are the reaction products of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil, and sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl tauride where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil or palm kernel oil.<br>
Other anionic surfactants suitable for use in the shampoo compositions are the succinnates, examples of which include disodium N-octadecylsulfosuccinnate, disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, diammonium lauryl sulfosuccinate, tetrasodium N-(l,2-dicarboxyethyl)-N-octadecylsulfosuccinnate, diamyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, dihexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, and dioctyl esters of sodium sulfosuccinic acid.<br>
Other suitable anionic surfactants include olefin sulfonates having about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms. In this context, the term "olefin sulfonates" refers to compounds which can be produced by the sulfonation of alpha-olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sulfones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy-alkanesulfonates. The alpha-olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are mono-olefins having from about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms,<br><br>
preferably from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms.  Preferably, they are straight chain olefins.<br>
Another class of anionic surfactants suitable for use herein is the beta-alkyloxy alkane sulfonates. These surfactants conform to the formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)where is a straight chain alkyl group having from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms,<br>
R.2 is a lower alkyl group having from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, preferably 1 carbon atom, and M is a water-soluble cation as described.<br>
In addition to the sulfates, isethionates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates described above, other potential anions for the anionic surfactant include phosphonates, phosphates, and carboxylates.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention may also include one or more additional surfactants selected from the group consisting of amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and nonionic surfactants. Suitable amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic surfactants, or nonionic surfactants for use in the personal care compositions herein include-those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. Concentration of such surfactants preferably ranges from about 0.5% to about 20%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition. Non-limiting examples of suitable surfactants are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,104,646 and 5,106,609, both to Bolich, Jr. et al.<br>
Non-limiting examples of other surfactants suitable for use in the personal care compositions are described in McCutcheon's, Emulsifiers and Detergents, 1989 Annual, published by M. C. Publishing Co. C.       Aqueous Carrier<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise an aqueous carrier. The level and species of the carrier are selected according to the compatibility with other components and other desired characteristic of the product. Generally, the aqueous carrier is present in an amount from about 20% to about 95% by weight of the composition. An aqueous carrier may be selected such that the composition of the<br><br>
