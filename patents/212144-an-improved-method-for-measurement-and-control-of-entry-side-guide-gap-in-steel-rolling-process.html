				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rolling mill having an improved entry side guide gap<br>
measurement and controlling system. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
measurement and control of entry side guide in a hot strip mill during rolling of hot slab<br>
into strip, which would enable measurement and control of the entry side guide gap, by<br>
incremental encoder and Programmable controller based system and would thus be<br>
simple and accurate.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In a Hot Strip Mill, strips of different thickness and width are rolled from slab. The Hot<br>
Strip Mill of Rourkela Steel Plant, where the innovation has been developed consists of<br>
3 Roughing stands and 6 Finishing stands. The first roughing stand (R0/V0) is a<br>
combination horizontal stand and a vertical stand. The other two roughing stands (R1<br>
and R2) are 4 high horizontal stands. There is a delay table after R2 stand, one coil box<br>
and a crop shear at the end of the delay table. There are six numbers of 4 high finishing<br>
stands (F1 to F6) and two hydraulic down coilers. There are entry side guides before coil<br>
box, crop shear and finishing stands F1 to F6. A 10 kW AC motor through a gear (ratio<br>
6.3 : 1) and rack &amp; pinion arrangement adjusts the entry guide gap.<br>
Each finishing stand and the crop shear is having entry side guide to hold the material<br>
during rolling. The entry side guides gap should be 10-20 mm more than the width of<br>
the strip being rolled. The mill rolls strips whose width varies in the range of 700 to 1400<br>
mm and thus the entry guide gap is to be adjusted as per the width of the strip. Thus<br>
precise measurement of the gap is important for rolling of strip.<br>
In a conventional rolling mill the entry guide gap was measured by synchro transmitter<br>
receiver based angle measurement system where resolution was poor and inconsistent.<br>
Such conventional manually operated system for entry guide gap measurement and<br>
control suffers from drawbacks / disadvantages which are discussed hereunder:<br>
A. Resolution is in the order of 20 mm.<br>
B. No provision for storing the gap information.<br>
C. Automatic setting of gap based on strip width information was not possible.<br>
D. Operator used to adjust the entry guide with more tolerances than norm as the<br>
correct measurement was not available. Less gap creates cobble and more gap<br>
creates wobbling of the coil back end and coil shape becomes bad.<br>
E. Jamming of mechanism could not be known, as there was no indication.<br>
F. There was no system to indicate guide extreme position and stopping the motor<br>
to prevent over travelling.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus basic object of the present innovation to provide a precise measurement of<br>
entry side guide gap and control of the motor to prevent over travelling of the guides in a<br>
rolling mill.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a solution in an existing rolling<br>
mill to have a record of entry side guide gap. This helps in analysis and cause of cobble.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a rolling mill having an<br>
improved entry side guide gap measurement and controlling system, said rolling mill<br>
comprising:<br>
an entry side guide having a variable gap;<br>
a gap guide motor having a motor shaft;<br>
a gear box having multiple stages of reduction and connected to the motor<br>
shaft;,<br>
an encoder for sensing motor shaft rotation and generating signals ;<br>
a CAM switch connected with the motor shaft, each CAM switch adapted to<br>
sense the maximum and minimum travel of the motor and having multiple<br>
independent contacts adapted to be disposed in ON or OFF positions by<br>
adjusting the CAM with respect to a predefined relation between CAM switch<br>
angular displacement and linear displacement of guide ;<br>
a programmable controller system for calculating the entry guide gap and<br>
generating an analog output for rotating the entry guide motor in a forward<br>
and reverse direction;<br>
a signal isolation unit having a signal isolation amplifier for isolating the<br>
signal represented by the analog output generated by the programmable<br>
controller system;<br>
one or more display units for displaying the entry guide gap ; and control<br>
units for altering the entry side gap.<br>
A schematic diagram of entry guide gap measurement system is shown in Fig 1<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The system consists of the following components<br>
(i) Encoder<br>
(ii) CAM switch<br>
(iii) Gear box<br>
(iv) Programmable controller<br>
(v) Buffer amplifier<br>
(vi) Digital display<br>
(vii) Human machine Interface<br>
(viii) Open / Close contact<br>
(ix) Output contactor<br>
Encoder<br>
Encoder used here is incremental type encoder having 1024 number of pulses per<br>
revolution. The encoder is Heidhain (Germany) make. However the developed system<br>
can accept encoder of any make. The number of pulses decides the accuracy of the<br>
measurement system. The encoder generates Ua1, Ua2, Ua0 and complements of all<br>
the three pulses. In each 360° rotation of the encoder shaft, Ua1, Ua2 generates 1024<br>
pulses, whereas Ua0 generates 1 pulse. Ua2 pulse leads Ua1 or lags Ua1, depending on<br>
the encoder shaft running forward or reverse direction.<br>
Gear box:<br>
The gear box is having four stages of reduction. The reduction in each stage is as given<br>
in Table-1.<br>
The gear box is connected with the motor shaft through love joy coupling. Speed<br>
reduction for the CAM switch is 480:1. Shaft for each gear is fabricated with EN 24<br>
material. Material for gears is EN 9. Each shaft is mounted on bearing with bearing<br>
housing. The gear box body consist of two halves and manufactured from MS IS 2026<br>
sheet. Gear box is foot mounted.<br>
CAM switch<br>
The CAM switch is connected with the motor shaft after a speed reduction of 480 as<br>
shown in Fig 2. Each CAM switch is having six independent contact. Each contact rated<br>
for 10 amps at 230 V AC. The switches can be made ON or OFF at any position by .<br>
adjusting the CAM. Relation between CAM switch angular displacement and^. linear<br>
displacement of guide is as derived below:<br>
Entry guide Motor speed 725 RPM<br>
Existing gear ratio 6.3:1<br>
Therefore speed after reducer = 725 / 6.3 = 115 RPM<br>
Screw pitch = 10 mm<br>
55.5 revolution of the screw shaft shifts each guide by 555 mm<br>
Therefore total gap = 555 * 2 = 1110 mm<br>
Minimum gap = 600 mm<br>
Maximum gap = 600 + 1110 = 1710 mm<br>
Gear ratio between motor shaft to CAM switch = 480:1<br>
CAM switch rotation for 55.5 revolution of the screw shaft = 55.5 * 6.3 * 360 / 480 =<br>
262 deg<br>
262deg = 1110 mm<br>
1 deg = 1110/262 = 4.24 mm<br>
Programmable Controller System<br>
The programmable controller system consists of CPU, Communication module, Counter<br>
module, Digital input module, Digital output module. The part number of the modules is<br>
listed in Table-2.<br>
The programmable controller system calculates the entry guide gap and generates an<br>
analog output (4-20 mA) through analog output card. This 4-20 mA corresponds to an<br>
entry guide gap of 0 to 1999 mm.<br>
Siemens make programmable controller have been used in this particular application.<br>
However programmable controller of any make having counter modules, digital input,<br>
digital output, analog output modules can be used in the measurement system.<br>
Signal isolation Unit<br>
The analog output module outputs 4-20 mA signal corresponds to entry guide gap of 0<br>
to 1999 mm. This signal is isolated in a signal isolation amplifier. The specification of<br>
isolation amplifier is given in Table-3.<br>
Display unit<br>
The entry guide gap is displayed in the speed cabin through a seven segment type<br>
display device. Each display is having 3½ digit. Display unit accepts 4-20 mA and<br>
displays 0 to 1999 corresponds to input signal. Display unit is having span and offset<br>
adjustment facility. Display units are powered by 230 V AC. There are seven display<br>
units to show the entry guide gap for crop shear, F1 to F6 stand.<br>
OPEN / CLOSE contact<br>
The operator can increase or decrease the entry guide gap either from speed cabin or<br>
from the stand post. Two push buttons are there in speed cabin and two push buttons<br>
are in the stand post for each guide. These push buttons are designated for gap open<br>
and gap close contact. These inputs are brought to the digital inputs of the<br>
programmable controller.<br>
Output Contactor<br>
Entry guide motor can be rotated in forward or reverse direction by the programmable<br>
controller output. Two digital output lines are assigned for each entry guide motor to run<br>
in forward or reverse direction. Coil of each contactor is rated for 24 V DC and is having<br>
4 NO + 4 NC contact.<br>
PC in the speed cabin<br>
Each entry guide gap is displayed in the speed cabin in a PC. WinCC package has<br>
been used to develop the MMI screen.<br>

The measurement and control system thus provides<br>
(i) measurement of entry guide gap and display its value in engineering unit at the<br>
operator"s cabin<br>
(ii) control of entry guide motor through the inputs from CAM switch to prevent over<br>
travelling.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained in great detail in<br>
relation to non limiting exemplary embodiments of the measurement system of the<br>
invention in relation to the accompanying figures wherein<br>
Fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of entry guide gap measurement system.<br>
Fig 2 is a flow chart for measuring and controlling mechanism.<br>
Reference is first invited to Fig 1 where general arrangement of the measurement<br>
system is shown. An incremental encoder (1) senses the Motor shaft rotation. The<br>
encoder signal will be processed in counter module (21) of the programmable controller<br>
(2). The gap (7) between guides (71) and (72) from the gear box (8) of gear ration 6.3:1<br>
is calculated based on increase or decrease in count from a preset vale in the counter<br>
module. The motor output is reduced to 480:1 and a CAM switch (3) is connected on<br>
the reduced shaft. The CAM switch senses the maximum and minimum travel of the<br>
motor and passes on to Digital Input Module (23) of the programmable controller. The<br>
Digital Output Module (24) of programmable controller provides the motor forward and<br>
reverse contact output. The central processing unit (25) provides general information to<br>
the human machine interphase. Encoder signal is processed in a programmable<br>
controller. The programmable controller generates an analog output of 4-20 mA (via<br>
analogue output module (22)) corresponds to entry guide gap of 0 to 1999 mm. This<br>
signal is isolated via signal isolation unit (4) and fed to display unit at speed cabin (5).<br>
Fig 2 shows the flow chart of the measurement system. The encoder output is<br>
connected with the incremental encoder module in the PLC. Initially a preset value (PR)<br>
is loaded in the counter of the PLC. This corresponds to a gap of 1000 mm. As the<br>
encoder rotates, the counter reading (CR) changes.<br>
Number of pulse N = CR-PR<br>
Number of rotation NR =N/(1024*6.3)<br>
Gap=1000+ [NR* 10*2]<br>
It is thus possible by the way of the above-discussed system of the invention to<br>
measure the entry side guide gap.<br>
The system of the invention is thus a cost effective solution for entry side guide gap<br>
measurement and control of entry guide motor in a Hot Strip Mill.<br>
