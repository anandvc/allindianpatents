				<td>The present invention relates to a compound of formula (I).<br>
This invention concerns compounds having histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting enzymatic activity. It further relates to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them, as well as their use, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit HDAC and as a medicine, for instance as a medicine to inhibit proliferative conditions, such as cancer and psoriasis.<br>
Nuclear histones are known as integral and dynamic components of the machinery responsible for regulating gene transcription and other DNA-templated processes such as replication, repair, recombination, and chromosome segregation. They are the subject of post-translational modifications including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation.<br>
Histone deacetylase(s), herein referred to as "HDACs", are enzymes that catalyze the removal of the acetyl modification on lysine residues of proteins, including the core nucleosomal histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Together with histone acetyltransferase(s), herein referred to as "HATs", HDACs regulate the level of acetylation of the histones. The balance of acetylation of nucleosomal histones plays an important role in transcription of many genes. Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with condensed chromatin structure resulting in the repression of gene transcription, whereas acetylated histones are associated with a more open chromatin structure and activation of transcription.<br>
Eleven structurally related HDACs have been described and fall into two classes. Class I HDACs consist of HDAC 1, 2, 3, 8 and 11 whereas class II HDACs consist of HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. Members of a third class of HDACs are structurally unrelated to the class I and class II HDACs. Class I/II HDACs operate by zinc-dependent mechanisms, whereas class III HDACs are NAD-dependent.<br>
In addition to histones, other proteins have also been the substrate for acetylation, in particular transcriptionfactors such as p53, GATA-1 and E2F; nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor, the thyroid receptors, the estrogen receptors; and cell-cycle regulating proteins such as pRb. Acetylation of proteins has been linked with protein stabilization, such as p53 stabilization, recruitment of cofactors and increased DNA binding. p53 is a tumour suppressor that can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in <br>
response to a vaneiy of stress signals, such as DNA damage. The main target for p53-induced cell cycle arrest seems to be the p21 gene. Next to its activation by p53, p21 has been identified by virtue of its association with cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes resulting in cell cycle arrest at both Gl and G2 phases, its up-regulation during senescence, and its interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.<br>
The study of inhibitors of HDACs indicates that they play an important role in cell cycle arrest, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and reversal of transformed phenotypes.<br>
The inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), for example, causes cell cycle arrest at both Gl and G2 phases, reverts the transformed phenotype of different cell lines, and induces differentiation of Friend leukemia cells and others. TSA (and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA) have been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al., Nature, 401: 188-193, 1999).<br>
Trichostatin A has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis, e.g. liver fibrosis and liver chirrhosis. (Geerts et al., European Patent Application EP 0 827 742, published 11 March, 1998).<br>
The pharmacophore for HDAC inhibitors consists of a metal-binding domain, which interacts with the zinc-containing active site of HDACs, a linker domain, and a surface recognition domain or capping region, which interacts with residues on the rim of the<br>
active site.<br>
Inhibitors of HDACs have also been reported to induce p21 gene expression. The transcriptional activation of the p21 gene by these inhibitors is promoted by chromatin remodelling, following acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the p21 promotor region. This activation of p21 occurs in a p53-independent fashion and thus HDAC inhibitors arc operative in cells with mutated p53 genes, a hallmark of numerous tumours.<br>
In addition HDAC inhibitors can have indirect activities such as augmentation of the host immune respons and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and thus can suppress the growth of primary tumors and impede metastasis (Mai et al., Medicinal Research Reviews, 25: 261 309).<br>
In view of the above, HDAC inhibitors can have great potential in the treatment of cell proliferative diseases or conditions, including tumours with mutated p53 genes.<br><br>

Preferably, such inhibition is specific, i.e. the histone deacetylase inhibitor reduces the ability of a histone deacetylase to remove an<br><br>
acetyl group from a histone at a concentration that is lower than the concentration of the inhibitor that is required to produce some other, unrelated biological effect.<br>

In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes.<br>
To prepare the phannaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which earner may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual phannaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise stenle water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, maybe prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment.<br><br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient, calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>

The term "platinum coordination compound" is used herein to denote any tumour cell growth inhibiting platinum coordination compound which provides platinum in the form of an ion.<br>
The term "taxane compounds" indicates a class of compounds having the taxane ring system and related to or derived from extracts from certain species of yew (Taxus) trees.<br>
The term "topisomerase inhibitors" is used to indicate enzymes that are capable of altenng DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, namely type 1 and type II. Topoisomerase 1 is a monomeric enzyme of approximately 100,000 molecular weight. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind) and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand. Topisomerase II has a similar mechanism of action which involves the induction of DNA strand breaks or the formation of free radicals.<br>
The term "camptothecin compounds" is used to indicate compounds that are related to or derived from the parent camptothecin compound which is a water-insoluble alkaloid<br><br>
derived from the Chinese tree Camplothecin acuminata and the Indian tree<br>
Nothapodytes foetida.<br>
The term "podophyllotoxin compounds" is used to indicate compounds that are related<br>
to or derived from the parent podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mandrake<br>
plant.<br>
The term "anti-tumour vinca alkaloids" is used to indicate compounds that are related to or derived from extracts of the periwinkle plant (Vinca rosea).<br>
The term "alkylating agents" encompass a diverse group of chemicals that have the common feature that they have the capacity to contribute, under physiological conditions, alkyl groups to biologically vital macromolecules such as DNA. With most of the more important agents such as the nitrogen mustards and the nitrosoureas, the active alkylating moieties are generated in vivo after complex degradative reactions, some of which are enzymatic. The most important pharmacological actions of the alkylaling agents are those that disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation in particular DNA synthesis and cell division, The capacity of alkylating agents to interfere with DNA function and integrity in rapidly proliferating tissues provides the basis for their therapeutic applications and for many of their toxic properties.<br>
The term "anti-tumour anthracyclme derivatives" comprise antibiotics obtained from the fungus Strep, peuticus var. caesius and their derivatives, characterised by having a tetracycline ring structure with an unusual sugar, daunosamine, attached by a glycosidic linkage.<br>
Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER 2) in primary breast carcinomas has been shown to correlate with a poor clinical prognosis for certain patients. Trastuzumab is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal IgGl kappa antibody that binds with high affiniity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor.<br>
Many breast cancers have estrogen receptors and growth of these tumours can be stimulated by estrogen. The terms "estrogen receptor antagonists" and "selective estrogen receptor modulators" are used to indicate competitive inhibitors of estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Selective estrogen receptor modulators, when bound to the ER, induces a change in the three-dimensional shape of the receptor, modulating its binding to the estrogen responsive element (ERE) on DNA.<br><br>
In postmenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogen is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition or inactivation is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.<br>
The term "antiestrogen agent" is used herein to include not only estrogen receptor antagonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators but also aromatase inhibitors as discussed above.<br>
The term "differentiating agents" encompass compounds that can, in various ways, inhibit cell proliferation and induce differentiation. Vitamin D and retinoids are known to play a major role in regulating growth and differentiation of a wide variety of normal and malignant ceil types. Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBA's) increase the levels of endogenous retinoic acids by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-medialed catabolism of retinoic acids.<br>
DNA methylation changes are among the most common abnormalities in human neoplasia. Hypermethylation within the promotors of selected genes is usually associated with inactivation of the involved genes. The term "DNA methyl transferase inhibitors" is used to indicate compounds that act through pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyl transferase and reactivation of tumour suppressor gene expression.<br>
The term "kinase inhibitors" comprises potent inhibitors of kinases that are involved in cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (apoptosis)<br>
The term "farnesyltransferase inhibitors" is used to indicate compounds that were designed to prevent farnesylation of Ras and other intracellular proteins. They have been shown to have effect on malignant cell proliferation and survival.<br>
The term "other IIDAC inhibitors" comprises but is not limited to:<br>

C. Pharmacological example:<br>
The m vitro assay for inhibition of histone deacetylase (see example C. 1) measures the inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity obtained with the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Cellular activity of I he compounds of formula (I) was determined on A2780 tumour cells using a colorimetric assay for cell toxicity or survival (Mosmann Tim, Journal of Immunological Methods 65: 55-63, 1983)(see example C.2).<br>
The solubility of a compound measures the ability of a compound to stay in solution. In a first method the ability of a compound to stay in aqueous solution upon dilution (see example C 3.a) is measured. DMSO-stock solutions are diluted with a single aqueous buffer solvent in 3 consecutive steps. For every dilution turbidity is measured with a nephelomcter.<br>
In a second method the solubility of a compound at different pH's can be measured with the use of a chemiluminescent nitrogen detector (see example C.3.b).<br>
A drug's permeability expresses its ability to move from one medium into or through another. Specifically its ability to move through the intestinal membrane into the blood stream and/or from the blood stream into the target. Permeability (see example C.4) can be measured through the formation of a filter-immobilized artificial membrane phospholipid bilayer. In the filter-immobilized artificial membrane assay, a "sandwich" is formed with a 96-well microtitre plate and a 96-well filter plate, such that each composite well is divided into two chambers with a donor solution at the bottom and an acceptor solution at the top, separated by a 125 \ua micro-filter disc (0.45 u.m pores), coated with 2%(wi/v) dodecane solution of dioleoylphosphatidyl-choline, under conditions that multi-lamellar bilayers form inside the filter channels when the system contacts an aqueous buffer solution. The permeability of compounds through this artificial membrane is measured in cm/s. The purpose is to look for the permeation of the drugs through a parallel artificial membrane at 2 different pH's: 4.0 and 7.4. Compound detection is done with UV-spe,ctrometry at optimal wavelength between 250 and 500 nm.<br>
Metabolism of drags means that a lipid-soluble xenobiotic or endobiotic compound is enzymatically transformed into (a) polar, water-soluble, and excretable metabolite(s). The major organ for drug metabolism is the liver. The metabolic products are often less active than the parent drug or inactive. However, some metabolites may have enhanced activity or toxic effects. Thus drug metabolism may include both "detoxication" and "toxication" processes. One of the major enzyme systems that determine the organism's capability of dealing with drugs and chemicals is represented by the cytochrome P450 rnonooxygenases, which are NADPH dependent enzymes. Metabolic stability of compounds can be determined in vitro with the use of subcellular human tissue (see example C.S.a.). Here metabolic stability of the compounds is expressed as % of drug metabolised after 15 minutes incubation of these compounds with microsomes. Quantitation of the compounds was determined by LC-MS analysis. Metabolic stability of compounds can also be determined by calculating the half live of compounds in rat hepatocyte cells (see example C.5.b.)-<br>
It has been shown that a wide variety of anti-tumoral agents activate the p21 protein, including DNA damaging agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors. DNA damaging agents activate the p21 gene through the tumour suppressor p53, while histone deacetylase inhibitors transcriptionally activates the p21 gene via the transcription factor Spl. Thus, DNA damaging agents activate the p21 promoter through the p53 responsive element while histone deacetylase inhibitors activate the p21 promoter through spl sites (located at the -60 bp to +40 bp region relative to the TATA box) both leading to increased expression of the p21 protein. When the p21 promoter in a cells consists of a p21 1300 bp promoter fragment that does not comprise the p53 responsive elements it is accordingly non-responsive to DNA damaging agents. The capacity of compounds to induce p21 can be evaluated in several ways. A first method is to treat tumour cells with the compound of interest and after lysis of the cells detects p21 induction with the p21 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (WAF1 ELISA of Oncogene). The p21 assay is a "sandwich" enzyme immunoassay employing both mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. A rabbit polyclonal antibody, specific for the human p21 protein, has been immobilized onto the surface of the plastic wells provided in the kit. Any p21 present in the sample to be assayed will bind to the capture antibody. The biotinylated detector monoclonal antibody also recognizes human p21 protein, and will bind to any p21, which has been retained by the capture antibody. The detector antibody, in turn, is bound by horseradish peroxidas-conjugated streptavidin. The horseradish peroxidase catalyses the conversion of the chromogenic substrate tetra-methylbenzidine from a colorless<br>
solution to a blue solution (or yellow after the addition of stopping reagent), the intensity of which is proportional to the amount of p21 protein bound to the plate. The colored reaction product is quantified using a spectrophotometer. Quantitation is achieved by the construction of a standard curve using known concentrations of p21 (provided lyophilised). This assay can measures p21 induction as the consequence of DNA damage or as the consequence of histone deacetylase inhibition (see example C.6.a.).<br>
Another method tests the capacity of compounds to induce p21 as the consequence of HDAC inhibition at the cellular level. The cells can be stably transfected with an expression vector containing a p21 1300bp promoter fragment that does not comprise the p53 responsive elements and wherein an increase of a reporter gene expression, compared to the control levels, identifies the compound as having p21 induction capacity. The reporter gene is a fluorescent protein and the expression of the reporter gene is measured as the amount of fluorescent light emitted (see example C.6.b.). The last method is an in vivo method wherein mice are used for screening the pharmaceutical activity of a compound. The above described stably transformed tumour cells can be administered to mice in an amount sufficient to effect production of a tumour. After the tumour cells had sufficient time to form a tumour, a potentially active compound can be administered to the animals and the effect of said compound on the tumour cells is evaluated by measuring the expression of the reporter gene. Incubation with pharmaceutical active compounds will result in an increase of reporter gene expression compared to the control levels (see example C.6.C.)<br>
Specific HDAC inhibitors should not inhibit other enzymes like the abundant CYP P450 proteins. The CYP P450 (E.coli expressed) proteins 3A4, 2D6 en 2C9 convert their specific substrates into a fluorescent molecule. The CYP3A4 protein converts 7-benzyloxy-trifluoromethyl coumarin (BFC) into 7-hydroxy-trifluoromethyI coumarin. The CYP2D6 protein converts 3-[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyI]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin (AMMC) into 3-[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyI]-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride and the CYP2C9 protein converts 7-Methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (MFC) into 7-hydroxy-trifluoromethyl coumarin. Compounds inhibiting the enzymatic reaction will result in a decrease of fluoresent signal (see example C.7).<br>
Example C. 1: In Vitro Assay for Inhibition of histone deacetylase:<br>
The HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay/Drug Discovery Kit of Biomol (cat.No: AK-500-0001) was used. The HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay is based on the Fluor de Lys (Fluorogenic Histone deAcetylase Lysyl) substrate and developer combination. The Fluor de Lys substrate, comprises an acetylated lysine side chain. Deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate so that, in the second step, treatment with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.<br>
HeLa nuclear extracts (supplier: Biomol) were incubated at 60 u,g/ml with 75 jjM of substrate. The Fluor de Lys substrate was added in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCI and 1 mM MgCl2.6H2O at pH 7.4. After 30 min, 1 volume of the developer was added. The fluorophore was excited with 355 nm light and the emitted light (450 nm) was be detected on a fluorometric plate reader. For each experiment, controls (containing HeLa nuclear extract and buffer), a blank incubation (containing buffer but no HeLa nuclear extract) and samples (containing compound dissolved in DMSO and further diluted in buffer and HeLa nuclear extract) were run in parallel. In first instance, compounds were tested at a concentration of 10"5M. When the compounds showed activity at 10"5M, a concentration-response curve was made wherein the compounds were tested at concentrations between 10"5M and 10 9M. All sample were tested 4 times. Tn each test the blank value was substracted from both the control and the sample values. The control sample represented 100% of substrate deactylation. For each sample the fluorescence was expressed as a percentage of the mean value of the controls. When appropriate ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce the amount of metabolites to 50% of the control) were computed using probit analysis for graded data. Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pfCso (the negative log value of the ICso-value) (see Table F-3).<br>
Example C.2: Determination of antiproliferative activity on A2780 cells<br>
All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. Final DMSO concentrations never exceeded 0.1 % (v/v) in cell proliferation assays. Controls contained A2780 cells and DMSO without compound and blanks contained DMSO but no cells. MTT was dissolved at 5 mg/ml in PBS. A glycine buffer comprised of 0.1 M glycine and 0.1 M NaCl buffered to pH 10.5 with NaOH (1 N) was prepared (all reagents were from Merck).<br>
The human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells (a kind gift from Dr. T.C. Hamilton [Fox Chase Cancer Centre, Pennsylvania, USA]) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 /ig/ml gentamicin and 10 % fetal calf serum.<br><br>
Cells were roulinely kept as rnonolayer cultures at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO, atmosphere. Cells were passaged once a week using a trypsin/EDTA solution at a split ratio of 1:40. All media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies. Cells were free of mycoplasma contamination as determined using the Gen-Probe Mycoplasma Tissue Culture kit (supplier: BioMerieux).<br>
Cells were seeded in NUNC™ 96-well culture plates (Supplier: Life Technologies) and allowed to adhere to the plastic overnight. Densities used for plating were 1500 cells per well in a total volume of 200 lil medium. After cell adhesion to the plates, medium was changed and drugs and/or solvents were added to a final volume of 200 n\. Following four days of incubation, medium was replaced by 200 /xl fresh medium and cell density and viability was assessed using an MTT-based assay. To each well, 25 /xl MTT solution was added and the cells were further incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. The medium was then carefully aspirated and the blue MTT-formazan product was solubilized by addition of 25 /xl glycine buffer followed by 100 /xl of DMSO. The microtest plates were shaken for 10 min on a microplate shaker and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured using an Emax 96-well spectrophotometer (Supplier: Sopachem). Within an experiment, the results for each experimental condition are the mean of 3 replicate wells. For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested at a single fixed concentration of 10"6 M. For active compounds, the experiments were repeated to establish full concentration-response curves. For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no cells or drugs) were run in parallel. The blank value was subtracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the mean value for cell growth (in absorbance units) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value for cell growth of the control. When appropriate, IC50-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce cell growth to 50% of the control) were computed using probit analysis for graded data (Finney, D.J., Probit Analyses, 2"d Ed. Chapter 10, Graded Responses, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1962). Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pIC50 (the negative log value of the IC5o-value)(see Table F-3).<br>

In the first dilution step, 10 u.1 of a concentrated stock-solution of the active compound, solubilized in DMSO (5mM), was added to 100 uJ phosphate citrate buffer pH 7.4 and mixed. In the second dilution step, an aliquot (20 |xl) of the first dilution step was further dispensed in 100 uj phosphate citrate buffer pH 7.4 and mixed. Finally, in the third dilution step, a sample (20 p.1) of the second dilution step was further diluted in<br><br>
1(X) u.1 phosphate citrate buffer pH 7.4 and mixed. All dilutions were performed in 96-well plates. Immediately after the last dilution step the turbidity of the three consecutive dilution steps were measured with a nephelometer. Dilution was done in triplicate for each compound to exclude occasional errors. Based on the turbidity measurements a ranking is performed into 3 classes. Compounds with high solubility obtained a score of 3 and for this compounds the first dilution is clear. Compounds with medium solubility obtained a score of 2. For these compounds the first dilution is unclear and the second dilution is clear. Compounds with low solubility obtained a score of 1 and for these compounds both the first and the second dilution are unclear (see Table F-3).<br>

Example C.4: Parallel artificial membrane permeability analysis<br>
The stock samples (aliquots of 10 uj of a stock solution of 5 mM in 100 % DMSO) were diluted in a deep-well or Pre-mix plate containing 2 ml of an aqueous buffer system pH 4 or pH 7.4 (PSR4 System Solution Concentrate (pION)). Before samples were added to the reference plate, 150 |il of buffer was added to wells and a blank UV-measurement was performed. Thereafter the buffer was discarded and the plate was used as reference plate. All measurements were done in UV-resistant plates (supplier: Coslar or Greiner).<br>
After the blank measurement of the reference plate, 150 uJ of the diluted samples was added to the reference plate and 200 u,l of the diluted samples was added to donorplate 1. An acceptor filter plate 1 (supplier: Millipore, type:MAIP N45) was coated with 4 u,l of the artificial membrane-forming solution (l,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycer-3-Phosphocholine in Dodecane containing 0.1% 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and placed on top of donor plate 1 to form a "sandwich". Buffer (200 fjJ) was dispensed into the acceptor wells on the top. The sandwich was covered with a lid and stored for 18h at room temperature in the dark.<br>
A blank measurement of acceptor plate 2 was performed through the addition of 150 uj of buffer to the wells, followed by an UV-measurement. After the blank measurement of acceptor plate 2 the buffer was discarded and 150 \JL\ of acceptor solution was transferred from the acceptor filter plate 1 to the acceptor plate 2. Then the acceptor filter plate 1 was removed form the sandwich. After the blank measurement of donor plate 2 (see above), 150 u.1 of the donor solution was transferred from donor plate 1 to<br><br>
donor plate 2. The UV spectra of the donor plate 2, acceptor plate 2 and reference plate wells were scanned (with a SpectraMAX 190). All the spectra were processed to calculate permeability with the PSR4p Command Software. All compounds were measured in triple. Carbamazepine, griseofulvin, acycloguanisine, atenolol, turoserrude, and chlorothiazide were used as standards in each experiment. Compounds were ranked in 3 categories as having a low permeability (mean effect  mean effect &gt; 0.5 x 10"fi cm/s; score 2) or a high permeability (&gt; 1 x 10"6 cm/s; score 3).<br>

The following protocol has been applied to determine the p21 protein expression level in human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. The A2780 cells (20000 cells /ISO u,I) were seeded in 96 microwell plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 jtg/ml gentamicin and 10 % fetal calf serum. 24 hours before the lysis of the cells, compounds were added at final concentrations of 10"5, 10"6, 10"7 and 10 M All compounds tested were dissolved in DMSO and further dilutions were made in culture medium. 24 hours after the addition of the compound, the supematants were removed from the cells. Cells were washed with 200 (il ice-cold PBS. The wells were<br><br>
aspirated and 30 u! of lysisbuffer (50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCI, 1 % Nonidet p40 and 10 % glycerol) was added. The plates were incubated overnight at -70 UC.<br>
The appropriate number of microtiter wells were removed from the foil pouch and placed into an empty well holder. A working solution (Ix) of the Wash Buffer (20x plate wash concentrate: 100 ml 20-fold concentrated solution of PBS and surfactant. Contains 2 % chJoroacetamide) was prepared. The lyophilised p21WAF standard was reconstituted with distilled H2O and further diluted with sample diluent (provided in the kit)<br>
The samples were prepared by diluting them 1:4 in sample diluent. The samples (100 uj) and the p21 WAF1 standards (100 uj) were pipetted into the appropriate wells and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The wells were washed 3 times with Ix wash buffer and then 100 uJ of detector antibody reagent (a solution of biotinylated monoclonal p21 WAF1 antibody) was pipetted into each well. The wells were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed three times with Ix wash buffer. The 400x conjugate (peroxidase streptavidine conjugate: 400-fold concentrated solution) was diluted and 100 p.1 of the Ix solution was added to the wells. The wells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed 3 times with Ix wash buffer and 1 time with distilled 112O. Substrate solution (chromogenic substrate)( 100 jxl) was added to the wells and the wells were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Stop solution was added to each well in the same order as the previously added substrate solution. The absorbance in each well was measured using a spectrophotometiic plate reader at dual wavelengths of 450/595 nm. For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no cells or drugs) were run in parallel. The blank value was substracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the value for p21 WAF1 induction (in absorbance units) was expressed as the percentage of the value for p21 WAF1 present in the control.

The assay for the CYP2C9 protein comprises per well 15 pmol P450/mg protein (in 0.01M NaKphosphate buffer +1.15% KC1), an NADPH generating system (3.3 mM GIucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 U/ml Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.3 mM NADP and 3.3 mM MgCl2.6H2O in assay buffer) and compound in a total assay volume of 100 uj. After a 5 min pre-incubation at 37 °C the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 200 fiM of the fluoresent probe substrate MFC in assay buffer. After an incubation of 30 minutes at room temperature the reaction was terminated after addition of 2 volumes of acetonitrile. Fluorescent determinations were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. Sulfaphenazole (ICso-value = 6.8 X 10"7 M) was included as reference compound in this experiment.<br>
For initial screening purposes, compounds were tested at a single fixed concentration of 1 X 10 5 M. For active compounds, the experiments were repeated to establish full concentration-response curves. For each experiment, controls (containing no drug) and a blank incubation (containing no enzyme or drugs) were run in parallel. All compounds were assayed in quadruplicate. The blank value was subtracted from all control and sample values. For each sample, the mean value of P450 activity of the sample (in relative fluorescence units) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value of P450 activity of the control. Percentage inhibition was expressed as 100% minus the mean value of P450 activity of the sample. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce P450 activity to 50% of the control) were calculated.<br>

D. Composition example: Film-coated tablets<br>
Preparation of tablet.core<br>
A mixture of 100 g of a compound of formula (I), 570 g lactose and 200 g starch is mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 g sodium dodecyl sulphate and 10 g polyvinyl-pyrrolidone in about 200 ml of water. The wet powder mixture is sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there is added 100 g microcrystalline cellulose and 15 g hydrogenated vegetable oil. The whole is mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each comprising 10 mg of a compound of formula (I). Coating<br>
To a solution of 10 g methyl cellulose in 75 ml of denaturated ethanol there is added a solution of 5 g of ethyl cellulose in 150 ml of dichloromethane. Then there are added 75 ml of dichloromethane and 2.5 ml 1,2,3-propanetriol 10 g of polyethylene glycol is molten and dissolved in 75 ml of dichloromethane. The latter solution is added to the former and then there are added 2.5 g of magnesium octadecanoate, 5 g of polyvinyl-pyrrolidone and 30 ml of concentrated colour suspension and the whole is homogenated.
