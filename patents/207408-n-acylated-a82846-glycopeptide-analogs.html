				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for selectively N-acylating a glycopeptide, in particular,A82846A, A82846B, A82846C and PA-42867A.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The emergence of enterococci resistant to Vancomycin has been increasing over the past decade. Given that vancomycin is the last defense against many Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there is an urgency for new antibiotics. In recent years, research has focused on glycopeptides that are structurally similar to vancomycin in the search for new antibiotics that may be active against these resistant strains, including Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE).A82846 glycopeptide analogs have been shown to be some of the most active glycopeptides against a broad range of multi-drug resistantorganisms. (see, e. g., U. S. Patent Nos.5, 591, 714 and 5, 840, 684 ; and Cooper, R. D. G., N. J. Snyder M. J. Zweifel, M. A. Staszak, S. C. Wilkie, T. I. Nicas, D. L.Mullen, T. F. Butler, M. J. Rodriguez, B. E. Huff, and R. C.Thompson,"Reductive Alkylation of Glycopeptide Antibiotics :Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity,"J. Antibiotics, 49 (6) 575-581 (1996)).<br>
The natural A82846 analogs and Vancomycin are from the same general class of glycopeptides and have very similar structures. The major difference involves the presence of a 4-epi-vancosaminyl sugar at the benzylic hydroxyl of the sixth amino acid in the A82846 analogs and the different stereochemistry at the 4-position of the amino sugar in the disaccharide of the A82846 analogs as opposed to vancomycin.In general, these changes result in an increase in antibiotic activity. A82846 analogs have been shown to be more active than vancomycin against enterococci and equally as active against most staphylococcus strains.<br><br>
Synthetic modifications of glycopeptide antibiotics can be difficult due to their complex structures and their insolubility in reaction solvents. There are many conditions disclosed in the literature for amino acid acylations, a number of which have been successfully used for the acylation of vancomycin. For example, U. S. Patent Nos. 4, 639, 433 ; 4, 643, 987 ; and 4, 698, 327 describe the preparation of N-acyl derivatives of the glycopeptides vancomycin, A51568A, A51568B, M43A and M43D. (See alsoNagarajan, R., A. A. Schabel, J. L. Occolowitz, F. T. Counter, and J. L. Ott,"Synthesis and antibacterial activity of Nacyl vancomycins ,"J. Antibiotics, 41 (10), 1430-1438 (1988).) However, most of these conditions do not result in acylated products of A82846B. Unlike vancomycin, there are 3 separate sites of acylation in the A82846 analogs : the 2 saccharide amino groups(Nl and N2) and the N-terminal Nmethyl leucine nitrogen (N3), which can result in 7 different products, 3 mono-, 3 di-, and 1 tri-substituted products.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5, 591, 714 describes the acylation ofA82846A,<br>
A82846B, A82846C, and PA-42967-A. However, the conditions described therein do not provide guidance on how to selectively acylate either the Nl and N2 positions or theN3 position. Therefore, there is a need for an improved method for selectively acylating the A82846 glycopeptide analogs.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides methods for selectively acylating the Nl or N2 positions of an A82846 glycopeptide such asA82846A, A82846B, A82846C or PA-42867-A by acylating the parent glycopeptide with an activated ester such as Nacyl-hydroxysuccinimide or N-acyl -hydroxyphthalimide in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Alternatively, the N3 position is selectively acylated when the parent glycopeptide is acylated with an activated ester such as N-acylhydroxysuccinimide or N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide in aqueous methanol. The invention also provides the N-<br>
3<br><br>
monoacylated glycopeptide compounds resulting therefrom.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides the following : pharmaceutical con N-monoacylated glycopeptides described herein ; use of the monoacylated glycopeptides for treating a staphylococcal infection ; use of the monoacylated glycopeptides for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a staphylococcal infection ; and a method of controlling the growth of a microorganism susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of the monoacylated glycopeptide by providing to the locus where the microorganism is present (or contacting the microorganism) with an effective amount of the glycopeptide.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Present Invention provides a method for preparing a monoacylated glycopeptide acylated at the Nl or N2 position thereof, comprising : acylating a parent glycopeptide, which is selected from the group consisting of A82846A, A82846B, A82846C and PA-42867A, with an activated ester selected from N-acyl-hydroxysuccinimide and N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide  in  dimethylsulfoxide  to  yield  the  monoacylated  glycopeptide.<br>

Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
After numerous attempts with a variety of amino acid acylation conditions, Applicants surprisingly discovered that one can selectively acylate the Nl or N2 positions of an A82846 glycopeptide such as A82846A, A82846B, A82846C or PA-42867-A by acylating the parent glycopeptide with an activated ester such as N-acyl-hydroxysuccinimide or N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide in DMSO.  Alternatively, the N3 position is selectively acylated when the parent glycopeptide is acylated with an activated ester such as N-acyl-hydroxysuccinimide or N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide in aqueous methanol.<br>
For a general discussion on such activated esters, see M. Bodanszky in "Principles of Peptide Synthesis," pp. 32-35, Springer-Verlag, 1984.  Applicants have discovered that N-acyl-hydroxysuccinimide or N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide provide for selective acylation in a designated solvent, such as DMSO or an aqueous methanol mixture. N-acyl-hydroxysuccinimide and N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide activated esters are prepared using standard acid/alcohol condensation chemistry well know to those skilled in the art.  {see,<br>
48<br><br>
e.g., M. Bodanszky and A. Bodanszky in "The Practice of Peptide Shnthesis," Springer-Verlag, pp. 124-125, 1984)<br>
The A82846 glycopeptide analogs (A82846A, A82846B, A82846C and PA-42867-A) may be prepared using standard procedures well known in the art. (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,946,941; EP 265,071 and EP 231,111).<br>
The reaction of the N-acyl-hydroxysuccinxmide or N-acyl-hydroxyphthalimide with the glycopeptide is generally carried out at a temperature between about 50°C and about 110°C {preferably between about 60°C and 80°C) for about 15 to 24 hours {preferably 16 to 20 hours) in the appropriate designated solvent.  The temperature and reaction time may vary depending upon the solubility of the starting materials.  When DMSO is used as the solvent, Dimethylformamide (DMF) may also be present as a co-solvent in amounts up to about 40%.  However, DMF alone did not provide significant amounts of the desired acylated products.  The ratio of the activated ester to glycopeptide is generally from about 2:1 to about 3:1.<br>
The acylated products may be isolated using methodology known in the art, for example, using reverse-phase HPLC conditions employing a pH 3 phosphate buffer and acetonitrile.  The isolated products may be used per se or in the form of its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or<br>
49<br><br>
solvate.  The following set of examples illustrate the general reaction conditions for selectively acylating either the Nl or N2 positions, or the N3 position of a A82846A, A82846B, A82846C, or PA-42967-A glycopeptide.<br>
Examples<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals can be acquired from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, WI) , Sigma, and other commercial sources well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Analytical Testing Methods<br>
Fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS) is utilized to determine the site of acylation for the purified products.  See e.g., Nagarajan, R., et al., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1430-1438 (1988); and Roberts, G.D., et al . , J_. Antibiotics, 38, 713--720 (1985) .  Observation of the molecular ion indicates that the desired acyl derivative is obtained and then the fragmentation pattern is used to determine the site of acylation according to the following Table I:<br>
50<br>
Table I<br><br><br>
While other fragments are observed for each regioisomeric acyl derivative, these represent the unique fragment(s) observed for each.<br><br>
S1, S2 and S3 represent the sugar moiety indicated by the arrows in the structure above.  Nl, N2 and N3 identify the acylation site.<br>

Table II<br><br><br><br>
Pharmacology<br>
The compounds of the present invention have in vitro activity against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.  The antibacterial activity of the present compounds is illustrated in Tables III and IV.  The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a standard broth micro-dilution assay.  Table IV presents a comparison of the activity of illustrative compounds against representative vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-sensitive enterococci {Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis), mean geometric MIC (mcg/mL) , as determined by the standard broth microdilution assay.<br>
Assays for antimicrobial activity were performed using microbroth susceptibility testing methods as described by the NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratories Standards. 1990. Approved standard M7-A2.  Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bacteria that grow aerobically, 2 ed. , Villanova PA) .  Brain-heart infusion medium (BHI) was used for testing of enterococcci, and NCCLS recommendations for medium were followed for other bacteria.<br>
As indicated above, the compounds of the present invention have activity against both staphylococci<br>
55<br><br>
(including methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus strains) and enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-susceptible isolates). For a discussion of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains see, e.g., F.C. Tenover, M.V. Lancaster, N.C Hill, C.D. Steward, S.A. Stocker, G.A. Hancock, CM. O'hara, N.C Clark, and K. Hiramatsu, "Characterization of staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin and other glycopeptides," J. Clinical Microbiol. 36(4), 1020-1027 (1998).  The compounds are particularly active against staphylococci, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci (i.e., non-aureus strains}. Thus, the compounds of the present invention provide useful alternative treatments especially for those infections resistent to known therapies.<br>

Consequently, the acylated glycopeptide compounds prepared by the processes described herein are useful in treating infections caused by methici11in-resistant staphylococci, as well as vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci.  The compounds are particularly useful for treating infections caused by staphylococci, more particularly coagulase-negative strains of staphylococci.  Accordingly, the acylated glycopeptide compounds (including the formulations) are useful in the manufacture of a medicament for the therapeutic applications described herein.<br>
The compositions disclosed herein can also be used to control the growth of microorganisms susceptible to the<br>
58<br><br>
antimicrobial activity of the N-monoacylated glycopeptide antibiotics discussed herein.  By "control the growth" is meant retarding or inhibiting the growth of, stopping the growth of, or killing, the microorganism.  This results in a reduction in the adverse effects caused by the presence of the microorganism in any particular locus or milieu. These compositions can be formulated by conventional methods, and can contain formulation aids such as carriers, diluents, inert materials, surfactants, solvents, and other additives well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are disclosed, for example, in The Pharmacopeia of the United States and the National Formulary. Using these formulations, the present N-monoacylated glycopeptide antibiotics, alone or in combination with other antimicrobial substances, such as antibiotics, antifungals., etc., can also be prepared. Numerous conventional antibiotics and antifungals with which the present peptides and metal ions can be used are known in the art.<br>
The methods of the present invention for controlling the growth of microorganisms can be carried out in a variety of ways. The N-monoacylated glycopeptide antibiotics and compositions discussed herein can be applied directly to loci where undesirable microorganisms are present, alone or in a mixture with other active ingredients, carriers, diluents, or other additives, including other antimicrobial<br>
59<br><br>
agents, as is known in the art. The locus can be an inert surface, a surface of a mammal, or a surface of a plant. Inert surfaces include, for example, surfaces of medical and surgical equipment, laboratory bench tops, hospital room and hospital operating room equipment, walls, floors, and sinks.<br>
Furthermore, another invention herein is directed to a method of treating a patient suffering from or subject to a staphylococcal infection comprising administering to the patient a pharmaceutically effective amount of compound of any one of formulas I to IV.  References herein to treating a staphylococcal infection should be understood to include prophylactic therapy to prevent ox" inhibit the infection as well as the treatment of an established acute or chronic staphylococcal infection or physiological conditions associated with staphylococcal infection to essentially cure the patient of the infection, inhibit the degree (amount) of infection or ameliorate the physiological conditions associated therewith.  "Effective amount" is meant to describe an amount of the compound of the present invention effective within the scope of reasonable biological judgement, suitable for use in contact with the cells of humans and other mammals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio in treating a staphylococcal infection and thus producing the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
60<br><br>
Physiological conditions discussed herein include some, but not all, of the possible clinical situations where a anti-staphylococcal treatment is warranted.  Those experienced in this field are well aware of the circumstances requiring either an anti-staphylococcal treatment.<br>
A particular aspect of: the invention provides for a compound according to the invention to be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, though the compound may be administered alone.  "Pharmaceutical composition" means to a composition comprising a compound of any one of formulas I to IV and at least one component selected from the group comprising pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, coatings, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, emulsion stabilizing agents, suspending agents, isotonic agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, coloring agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, other therapeutic agents, lubricating agents, adsorption delaying or promoting agents, and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms.  The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions,<br>
61<br><br>
elixirs or syrups.  Examples of suspending agents include ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances.  Examples of antibacterial and antifungal agents for the prevention of the action of microorganisms include parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like.  Examples of isotonic agents include sugars, sodium chloride and the like.  Examples of adsorption delaying agents to prolong absorption include aluminum monosterate and gelatin.  Examples of adsorption promoting agents to enhance absorption include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.  Examples of suitable carriers, diluents, solvents, vehicles, solubilizing agents, emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers, include water, chloroform, sucrose, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, polyols, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, glycerol, polyethylene glycols, dimethylformamide, Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, vegetable oils (such as cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and the like, or suitable mixtures of<br>
62<br><br>
these substances.  Examples of excipients include lactose, milk sugar, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate phosphate.  Examples of disintegrating agents include starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, talc, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.<br>
Other therapeutic agents may be used in combination with a compound of the present invention, including any other antibiotics.<br>
The choice of material in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition other than the compound of any of formulas I to IV is generally determined in accordance with the chemical properties of the active compound such as solubility, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice.  For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate and talc may be used for preparing tablets.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in assorted forms such as tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups.<br>
63<br><br>
"Liquid dosage form" means the dose of the active compound to be administered to the patient is in liquid form, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.  In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers.<br>
Solid compositions of may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, and the like.<br>
When aqueous suspensions are used they can contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsion pharmaceutical composition may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner.  While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil.  Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier that acts as a stabilizer.  It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat.  Together, the . emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the emulsifying wax, and the way together with the oil and fat<br>
64<br><br>
make up the emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, a least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof.  The topical formulations may desirably include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for a formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties.  Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers.  Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.  Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
65<br><br>
In practice, a compound/pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a suitable formulation to humans and animals by topical or systemic administration, including oral, inhalational, rectal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, vaginal, colonic, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), intracisternal and intraperitoneal.  It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient.<br>

Systematic administration also can be by transmucosal or transdermal means, or the compounds can be administered orally.  For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation.  Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, bile salts and fusidic acid derivatives for transmucosal administration.  In addition, detergents may be used to facilitate permeation.  Transmucosal administration may be through use of nasal sprays, for example, or suppositories. For oral administration, the compounds are formulated into<br>
70<br><br>
conventional oral administration forms such as capsules, tablets, and tonics.<br>
"Formulations suitable for topical administration" means formulations that are in a form suitable to be administered topically to a patient.  The formulation may be presented as a topical ointment, salves, powders, sprays and inhalants, gels (water or alcohol based), creams, as is generally known in the art, or incorporated into a matrix base for application in a patch, which would allow a controlled release of compound through the transdermal barrier.  When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.  Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.  Formulations suitable for topical administration in the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient.  Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the' active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
71<br><br>
"Solid dosage form" means the dosage form of the compound of the invention is solid form, for example capsules, tablets, pills, powders, dragees or granules.  In such solid dosage forms, the compound of the invention is admixed with at least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid, (b) binders, as for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia, (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite, (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, (j) opacifying agents, (k) buffering agents , and agents which release the compound(s) of the invention in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain<br>
72<br><br>
an amount of active ingredient that is effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration for a patient.  The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, on the desired duration of treatment, the etiology and severity of the disease, the patient's condition and age, the potency of each component and other factors.<br>
The method comprises administering to the animal an amount of a compound of any one of formulas I to IV which is effective for this purpose.  In general, an effective amount of a compound of any of formulas I to IV is a dose between about 0.5 and about 100 mg/kg.  A preferred dose is from about 1 to about 60 mg/kg of active compound.  A typical daily dose for an adult human is from about 50 mg to about 5<br>
g.<br>
The percentage of active ingredient in a composition may be varied, though it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained.  Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of such submultiples thereof as may be used to make up the daily dose. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time.  A dosage may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.  Some patients may respond rapidly to a<br>
73<br><br>
higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate.  For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient.  It goes without saying that, for other patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.  It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the condition of the patient, the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time, duration and route of administration, rates of absorption and excretion, combination with other drugs and the severity of the particular disease being treated.<br>
The formulations can be prepared in unit dosage form by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.  In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials with elastomeric stoppers, and may be stored in a freeze-<br>
74<br><br>
dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.  Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Compounds within the scope of the present invention exhibit marked pharmacological activities according to tests described in the literature and below, which tests results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals.<br>
