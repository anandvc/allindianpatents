				<td>       FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invaition relates to have half cleaning composition contasnsnil lignin-derived materials, especially oligomeric lignin-derived dispersants, and even more especially economically viable lignin-derived mataials, and household cleaning and/or laimdry detergent compositions comprising such lignin-derived materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Despite the fact that the majority of cleaning products comprise siirfactants, it has been found that the direct actiim of surfectants, alone, fails to provide the most cfiectivB cleaning. Rather, other adjunct ingredients, including chelants, builders, and dispersants, are necessary to produce the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of a surfactant system. Additionally, fonnulations of cleaning conqwsitions, including liquid laundry detergents, liquid dishwashing detergents and hard surface cleaners often require other ingredients to maintain stability from phase separating and effect the desired viscosity of the resultant formulation. Additionally, cleaning compositions such as granular detergent compositions, too, necessitate the employment of dispersants for effective cleaning. Indeed, formulators of liquid laundry detergent compositions have conv«itionally adjusted the various properties of surfactant systems and adjunct ingrediraits of such compositions to maintain or yield liie desired stability and/or viscosity.<br>
Accordingly, the role of certain adjunct ingredients is fundamental to the effectiveness of many stirfactant-containing cleaning compositions, and specifically liquid detergent compositions. In particular, such adjunct ingredients aid a surfactant system in removing soils fiom fabric and/or other surfaces and prevait soil redeposition. In this respect, the role of soil dispersants is fundamental to the effectiveness of cleaning compositions, in particular laundry detergent compositions.<br>
In general, there exist two types of soils: hydrophilic (inter alia, clay) and hydrophobic (J.nter alia, grease and oil). Dual-purpose dispersants, which may be effective in dispersing both<br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic soils, may be formulated into granular laundry detergent con^ositions. However, the type and amount of such dispersaats that can be formulated into a liquid cleaning conqKjsition, such as liquid laundry detergents, hard surface cleaning composition and dishwashing liquid compositions, is severely limited.<br>
Those skilled in the art have attempted to resolve this dilemma via the development of ethoxylated polyalkyleneimines. Nevertheless, particularly with hydrophobic soils and certain surfactant systems, an admixture of ethoxylated polyalkyleneimine dispersants is often required to adequately suspend oily, greasy dirt. Moreover, alkoxylated polyamines tend to be less effective in dispersing hydrophobic soils when used in formulatiomi that possess a pH low enough to result in significant protonation of the otherwise hydrophobic polyalkyleneimine backbone. A pH of less than 10 is typically required and since most liquid laundry detergent systems are in range of pH 7 to pH 10 protonation will be sufficient in both the detergent formulation but also will occur during the wash.<br>
Thus, there exists a long felt need in the art to develop and employ efficient and cost-effective dispersants, which may be used in a wide variety of cleaning corq)ositions. Furthermore, dispersants which can readily be modified chemically to provide increased hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity would be beneficial to the formulator of such cleaning compositions, particularly where a wide range of properties are required and performance of the dispersants is oftrai dependexA upon the interactions with other cleaning cotr^osition ingredients.<br>
Lignin is one of the most abundant organic materials in nature and is the so-called "glue" in the cellulosic skeleton, which provides strength and support to trees and other plants. Lignin is also a major by-product of wood pulp processing in mills and, as such, often constitutes an environmental nuisance. Indeed, lignin is commonly isolated from the waste stream of pulp mills and tjqjically burned in boilers for fuel. The structure of lignin can be represented by the following complex, partial molecular structure in formula (T).<br><br>
(Structure Removed) <br><br>
Lignin, as produced from a pulp mill, is either termed "Kraft lignin" or "lignosulfonate". Commercially available Kraft lignin is sold as INDULIN AT™. Kraft Lignin and lignosulfonate typically possess weight average molecular weights (Mw) of from about 3,000 to 15,000g per mole and an oxygen content of about 20% to about 30% by total weight. Simplistically, these hgnin derivatives are often described as complex polymers of phenylpropane monomer units linked by oxygen atoms. Krafti lignin and lignosulfonate are often described by the following empirical formulas: Kraft lignin, C9H6.7O2.2S0.1(OCH3)0.90, and Lignosulfonate, C9H8.2O2.6(OCH3)0.94. lu these formulas, the sulfonate groups, -SO3, have been omitted in order to illusfrate the number of oxygen molecules in the lignin structure.<br>
Lignin phenol can be derived from Kraft lignin or from lignosulfonate via catal)^c reduction as described in US Patent Numbers 6,207,808, US 6,100,385 and US 5,230,814. It has been surprisingly found that lignin phenols and modified lignin phenols are effective cleaning conposition ingredients that may be adapted to convey a wide variety of benefits to consumers and formulators of cleaning conpositions. One representation of the lignin phenol empirical formula is described in US 6,100,385 as having an average composition of C9H10.6O.6O0.8(OCH3)0.02 where two, three and four or more of these repeat units are fused together, thus providing a chemical description of tibe basic structural features of lignin phenol. These structural representations are not intended to constitute an tdl-inclusive description of the class of compounds reared to as lignin phmols. Fuiliiermore, other, modified Ugnin phenols are described in the aforementioned patents and include modifications of lignin phenols by alkylation, alkoxylation, sulfonation, sul&amp;tion, alkoxysulfrttion, sulfomethylation and combinations thereof. Amino methylation has also been disclosed in the art but only in context of lignins and sulfonated lignins, as described in US Patent Number 5,972,047. Nevertheless, amino-methylated lignin phenols and amino-methylated modified lignin phenols have not previously been disclosed and to the extent that these compositions are novel, are claimed herein as novel.<br>
Thus, there exists a substantial need for cleaning compositions to contain improved dispersants, such as lignin derived materials, i.e., lignin phenols and/or modified lignin phenols of the present invention. The various features of the lignin derived materials of the present .invention facilitate thefr inclusion into household cleaning compositions, while maximizing their efficiency to act as dispersants and to aid in the function of surfactants and other adjunct ingredients of such cleaning compositions, as will become apparent from the following disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention fulfills the needs identified above by providing lignin-derived materials that can be used as effective dispersants in household cleaning and/or laundry detergent compositions.<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that lignin derived materials such as lignin phenol and lignin phenol derivatives (otiier^se known herein as "modified lignin phenols") constitute a meaningful and beneficial alternative to conventional dispersants used in cleaning con^ositions. The use of lignin phenols and/or lignin phenol derivatives of the present invention as dispersants in cleaning conqjositions provide several benefits over conventional dispersants, including, but not limited to, versatility and amenability to modification to improve the formulability of the dispersants into cleaning compositions.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, cleaning compositions comprising a lignin-derived materials selected firom the group consisting of lignin phenols, modified Ugnin phenols, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, novel modified lignin-derived materials, specifically amino-substituted lignin phenols, amino-substituted modified Ugmn phenols, amino-substituted alkylated lignin phenols, amino-substituted alkylated modified lignin phenols, and mixtures thereof. Such modified lignin-derived materials provide several advantages to consumers and formulators of cleaning coirjjositions, as will become apparent firom the following disclosure.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention includes a process of making a lignin phenol or a modified lignin phenol of the present invention comprising the steps of: a) performing a formaldehyde condensation of an amine with a lignin phenol; and b) optionally removing any water present and adding dimethylsulfate.<br>
hi still yet another aspect of the present invention, a method for treating a substrate in need of treatment (i.e., household surface and/or fabric article) comprismg contacting the substrate with a lignin-derived material or a cleaning composition comprising such Ugnin-darived material such that the substrate is treated, is provided.<br>
These/ and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art firom a reading of the following detailed descnption and the appended claims. All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION  OF THE INVENTION<br>
