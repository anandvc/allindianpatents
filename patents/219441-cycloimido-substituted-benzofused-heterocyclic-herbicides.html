and R3 is CH3 or NH2.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to compounds of formula I in which A is nitrogen double-bonded to position 2 and B is oxygen, and R, R3, J, X and n are as described above.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to compounds of formula I in which A is oxygen and B is CR1 double bonded to position 2, and R, R1, R3, J, X and n are as described above.<br>

As shown in the specification a wide range of substituents is described for position B in compounds of formula I whereas position A is generally unsubstituted. It was found that some herbicidal activity is retained when a methyl substituent is placed at position A, but that substitution at that position generally causes a sharp decrease in activity.<br>
Certain intermediates of the present invention are novel. These include compounds of formula II:<br>

where Y is NO2, NH2, or -NHN=C(CH3)R; Z is hydrogen, F, NH2, or OH; and R, J, X, and n are as described above; with the proviso that when Y is -NHN=C(CH3)R, Z is hydrogen.<br>
As used in this specification and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "alkyl," "alkenyl," "alkynyl," "haloalkyl," and "alkoxy" used alone or as part of a<br>
larger moiety, includes straight or branched carbon chains of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. "Halogen" refers to fluorine, bromine or chlorine. "THF" means tetrahydrofuran, "DMF" means N,N-dimethylformamide, and "DBU" means 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. When "n" in "X,n)" is 2 or 3, the substituents X may be the same or different from one another. Scheme 1<br>

Benzofurans of formula I, where A is oxygen and B is CH double bonded to position 2, may be generally prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Starting with an appropriately substituted fluoroaniline derivative 1, nitration provides intermediate 2. Displacement of the fluorine of 2 with a methoxy group as shown<br>
in step b, followed by reduction of the nitro group as shown in step c provide the methoxyaniline 3. The methoxyaniline 3 is a versatile intermediate from which a number of compounds of the present invention can be made by attachment of various J groups. For example, a uracil ring may be appended as shown in step d to give intermediate 4a. At this point, R3 substituents other than H may be introduced, as shown for example in step e to provide 4b where R3 is methyl. Using diazotization conditions (step f) 4b is converted to the iodoanisole 5 which is then deprotected to give the iodophenol 6. Palladium-catalyzed acetylenic coupling and ring closure as shown in step h give benzofurans 7 of the present invention. To obtain benzofurans of formula I where the J group is other than uracil, approaches analogous to that outlined in Scheme 1 may be followed. Such approaches based on Scheme 1 would be known to one skilled in the art. (Figure Remove)<br>

Benzoxazoles of formula I, where A is nitrogen double bonded to position 2 and B is oxygen, may be prepared as shown in Scheme 2 above. Starting with a phenol such as intermediate 8 nitration under standard conditions gives the nitrophenol 9. Certain of the benzoxazoles 11 of the present invention may be obtained by reduction of 9 to the aniline 10 followed by treatment with an acid halide (such as shown in step c). Alternatively, other benzoxazoles 11 may be obtained by treating 10 with carbonyldiimidazole to give intermediate 12 which can be O-alkyated according to step e. The approach outlined in Scheme 2 can be adapted, in ways known to one skilled in the art, to obtain benzoxazoles of formula I where the J group is other than uracil. (Figure Remove)<br><br>

Benzimidazoles of formula I, where A is NH and B is nitrogen double bonded to position 2, may be prepared as shown in Scheme 3 above. For example, intermediate 13 may be converted to the uracil 14 by the well-known chemistry previously described. Nitration of 14 followed by aminolysis of the fluorine group (steps b and c) provides the nitroaniline 15. The diamine 16 is obtained by reduction of 15 under standard conditions. Benzimidazoles 17 of the present invention are obtained by treatment of 16 with a carboxylic acid, an acid halide, an alkoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate, or thiophosgene according to step e. Other benzimidazoles 17 of the present invention are obtained by derivativization of benzimidazoles depicted in Scheme 3 using techniques known to one skilled in the art. The approach outlined in Scheme 3 can be adapted, in ways known also to one skilled in the art, to obtain benzimidazoles of formula I where the J group is other than uracil.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Benzimidazoles of structure 17A where R3 is NH2 are prepared in a manner analogous to that depicted in Scheme 3, except the NH2 group is attached following nitration of the phenyl ring. The 1-unsubstituted uracil ring is formed as previously described in step d of Scheme 1, followed by nitration of the phenyl ring (Scheme 3, step b). The uracil ring is then aminated in the 1-position by methods known in the art by treating it with 1-aminooxysulfonyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. The 1-aminouracil is then subjected to aminolysis of the phenyl fluorine (step c) followed by reduction to the diamine (step d).<br>

2,3-Benzimidazoles of formula I, where A and B are NH may be prepared from Intermediate 16 in Scheme 3 by heating it with an appropriately substituted acetaldehyde ethyl hemiacetal, affording compounds of Structure 17B.<br>

Indoles of formula I, where A is CH double bonded to position 2 and B is NR1, may be prepared according to Scheme 4 above. Using a Fischer indole route the starting aniline 18 may be converted to the corresponding hydrazone 19 which in turn may be cyclized under acidic conditions such as is shown in step b.<br>
-11-Th e resulting indoles 20 of the present invention may be further derivatized by alkylation of the indole ring nitrogen to indoles of formula I where R1 is other than hydrogen. The approach outlined in Scheme 4 can be adapted, in ways known to one skilled in the art, to obtain indoles of formula I where the J group is other than uracil.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Indoles of formula I, where A is NH and B is CR1 double bonded to position 2, may be prepared by a Fischer indole synthesis analogous to that shown in Scheme 4 starting with aniline 21. Substitution at the 3 position of indoles such as 22 with R1 groups is known to one skilled in the art.<br>

A stirred solution of 2.68 grams (0.01 mole) of 4-chloro-2-ethoxycarbonyl-7-nitroindole, 80 mL of acetic acid, and 15 mL of water was heated to 65 °C, and 18.3 grams (0.048 mole) of iron powder was slowly added during a 20<br>
minute period. Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 25 °C where it stirred for one hour. After this time, the reaction mixture was poured into water, and the resulting mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth. The filter cake was washed thoroughly with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure a residue. The residue was purified by column chromatography, yielding 0.4 gram of title compound. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step D Compound 595<br>
A stirred solution of 0.4 gram (0.0016 mole) of 7-amino-4-chloro-2-ethoxycarbonylindole and 0.26 gram (0.0016 mole) of 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophhalic anhydride in 80 ml of acetic acid was heated at reflux for about 18 hours. After this time, the reaction mixture was extracted with several portions of diethyl ether. The organic extracts were combined, dried with magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, yielding 0.47 gram of Compound 595. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure.<br>

The benzofused heterocyclic compounds of this invention were tested for pre- and postemergence herbicidal activity using a variety of crops and weeds. The test plants included soybean (Glvcine max var. Winchester), field corn (Zea mays var. Pioneer 3732), wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Lew), morningglory (Ipomea lacunosa or Ipomea hederacea). velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasth. green foxtail (Setaria viridis). Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense). blackgrass (Aloepecurus mvosuroides). common chickweed (Stellaria media), and common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L).<br>
For preemergence testing, two disposable fiber flats (8 cm x 15 cm x 25 cm) for each rate of application of each candidate herbicide were filled to an approximate depth of 6.5 cm with steam-sterilized sandy loam soil. The soil was leveled and impressed with a template to provide five evenly spaced furrows 13 cm long and 0.5 cm deep in each flat. Seeds of soybean, wheat, corn, green foxtail, and Johnsongrass were planted in the furrows of the first flat, and seeds of velvetleaf, morningglory, common chickweed, cocklebur, and blackgrass were planted in the furrows of the second flat. The five-row template was employed to firmly press the seeds into place. A topping soil of equal portions of sand and sandy loam soil was placed uniformly on top of each flat to a depth of approx­imately 0.5 cm. Flats for postemergence testing were prepared in the same manner except that they were planted 9-14 days prior to the preemergence flats and were placed in a greenhouse and watered, thus allowing the seeds to germinate and the foliage to develop.<br>
In both pre- and postemergence tests, a stock solution of the candidate herbicide was prepared by dissolving 0.27g of the compound in 20 ml of water/acetone (50/50) containing 0.5% v/v sorbitan monolaurate. For an application rate of 3000 g/ha of herbicide a 10 mL portion of the stock solution was diluted with water/acetone (50/50) to 45 ml. The volumes of stock solution and<br>
diluent used to prepare solutions for lower application rates are shown in the following .<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The preemergence flats were initially subjected to a light water spray. The four flats were placed two by two along a conveyor belt (i.e., the two preemergence followed by the two postemergence flats). The conveyor belt fed under a spray nozzle mounted about ten inches above the postemergent foliage. The preemergent flats were elevated on the belt so that the soil surface was at the same level below the spray nozzle as the foliage canopy of the postemergent plants. The spray of herbicidal solution was commenced and once stabilized, the flats were passed under the spray at a speed to receive a coverage equivalent of 1000L/ha. At this coverage the application rates are those shown in the above table for the individual herbicidal solutions. The preemergence flats were watered immediately thereafter, placed in the greenhouse and watered regularly at the soil surface. The postemergence flats were immediately placed in the green-house and not watered until 24 hours after treatment with the test solution. Thereafter they were regularly watered at ground level. After 12-17 days the plants were examined and the phytotoxicity data were recorded.<br>
Herbicidal activity data at selected application rates are given for various compounds of this invention in Table 4 and Table 5. The test compounds are identified by numbers which correspond to those in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Phytotoxicity data were taken as percent control. Percent control was determined by a method similar to the 0 to 100 rating system disclosed in<br>
"Research Methods in Weed Science," 2nd-ed., B. Truelove, Ed.; Southern Weed Science Society; Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, 1977. The rating system is as follows:<br>

 Formulation<br>
The compounds of the present invention were tested in the laboratory as water/acetone (50/50) solutions containing 0.5% v/v sorbitan monolaurate emulsifier. It is expected that all formulations normally employed in applications of<br>
herbicides would be usable with the compounds of the present invention. These include wettable powders, emulsiflable concentrates, water suspensions, flowable concentrates, and the like.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Herbicidal compositions are prepared by combining herbicidally effective amounts of the active compounds with adjuvants and carriers normally employed in the art for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for the particular utility desired, recognizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, for agricultural use the present herbicidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. It is to be understood that the amounts specified in this specification are intended to be approximate only, as if the word "about" were placed in front of the amounts specified.<br>
These herbicidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which suppression of vegetation is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient.<br>
Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the herbicidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc.<br>
Wettable powders, also useful formulations for both pre- and post-emergence herbicides, are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include Fuller's earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.0 parts of the herbicidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Additional wetting agent and/or oil will frequently be added to the tank mix for post-emergence application to facilitate dispersion on the foliage and absorption by the plant.<br>
Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the herbicidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isphorone, or other non-volatile organic solvents. For herbicidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the<br>
composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal composition.<br>
Flowable formulations are similar to ECs except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and will typically contain active ingredients in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.<br>
Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. Surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise 1 to 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents.<br>
Still other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relative coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Freon fluorinated hydrocarbons, may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are free-flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or water-miscible. The soluble or dispersible granular formulations described in US 3,920,442 are useful herein with the present herbicidal compounds. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations,<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%.<br>
The active herbicidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemicals and may be used as effective soil sterilants as well as selective herbicides in agriculture. In applying an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is of course employed; the amount may be as low as, e.g. about 1 to 250 g/ha, preferably about 4 to 30 g/ha. For field use, where there are losses of herbicide, higher application rates (e.g., four times the rates mentioned above) may be employed.<br>
The active herbicidal compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with other herbicides.
