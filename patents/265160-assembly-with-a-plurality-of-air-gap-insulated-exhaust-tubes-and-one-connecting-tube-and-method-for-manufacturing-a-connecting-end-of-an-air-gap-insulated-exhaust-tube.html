Assembly with a plurality of air-gap-insulated exhaust tubes and one<br>
connecting tube and method for manufacturing a connecting end of an'air-gap-<br>
insulated exhaust tube<br>
This invention relates to an assembly, in particular for an exhaust system,<br>
comprising at least two double-sheeted gas-carrying tubes, which each include<br>
an outer tube and an inner tube, and one connecting tube which is gas-tightly<br>
connected with the outer tubes, so that a transition is created from the two gas-<br>
carrying tubes to the connecting tube, wherein at their end associated to the<br>
connecting tube the outer tubes each have a connecting edge which is connected<br>
with the connecting edge of the adjacent gas-carrying tube. This invention also<br>
relates to a method for manufacturing a connecting end of a double-sheeted gas-<br>
carrying tube formed of an outer tube and an inner tube.<br>
Such gas-carrying tube also is known as an air-gap-insulated exhaust tube.<br>
The double-sheeted construction involves some problems when two or more gas-<br>
carrying tubes, for instance on the side of the exhaust manifold, must be<br>
connected to a single connecting tube. Since all tubes usually have a circular<br>
cross-section, the problem is to connect two circular tubes to one single circular<br>
tube. In the prior art, this problem has previously been solved such that the ends<br>
of the gas-carrying tubes associated to the connecting tube were cut off, and<br>
special connecting pieces were welded thereto. It was generally assumed that a<br>
cross-sectional shape suitable for a gas-tight connection with the connecting tube<br>
cannot be obtained in some other way. The connecting piece to be attached was<br>
manufactured separate from the outer tube and has had a circular cross-section<br>
at the end associated to the gas-carrying tube, so that it can be welded thereto,<br>
and a D-shaped cross-section at its opposite end. This allows to arrange the two<br>
gas-carrying tubes adjacent each other such that the two D-shaped cross-<br>
sections are lying back to back. The straight edges of the connecting pieces then<br>
form a connecting edge which can be welded to the adjacent connecting edge.<br>
On the whole, the two connecting pieces together form a cross-section which<br>
resembles the shape of an oblong hole. With its end facing the gas-carrying<br>
tubes, the connecting tube will be configured with the same cross-section, so that<br><br>
-2-<br>
the connecting tube can be put onto the two gas-carrying tubes and be welded<br>
thereto.<br>
What is disadvantageous in this kind of connection is the high effort required<br>
to provide an end at the gas-carrying tubes which is suitable for gas-tight<br>
connection with the connecting tube.<br>
The object of the invention consists in creating an assembly as mentioned<br>
above and a method for manufacturing a connecting end of a double-sheeted<br>
gas-carrying tube, which is characterized by lower costs.<br>
This object is achieved with an assembly mentioned above, by forming the<br>
connecting edge integrally with the outer tube and by obtaining it by plastic<br>
deformation of the outer tube. In a method as mentioned above it is provided in<br>
accordance with the invention that a connecting end of the outer tube, to which a<br>
connecting tube will be attached, is plastically deformed by means of a punch.<br>
The invention is based on the basic idea to no longer provide the suitable<br>
cross-sectional shape on a separate component and connect the same with the<br>
outer tube of the corresponding gas-carrying tube, as is done in the prior art, but<br>
to directly bring the outer tube itself into the desired shape. For this puFpose, a<br>
punch is used, which is pressed into the connecting end of the outer tube facing<br>
the connecting tube. The outer tube thereby is deformed such that the connecting<br>
edge is obtained, which can then be connected with the adjacent connecting<br>
edge of the further gas-carrying tube.<br>
When two gas-carrying tubes must be accommodated in the connecting tube,<br>
the connecting end of the two outer tubes of the gas-carrying tubes each<br>
preferably has a D-shaped cross-section. But when three gas-carrying tubes<br>
must be accommodated in the connecting tube, the connecting ends of the outer<br>
tubes preferably have a sector-shaped cross-section. Other cross-sectional<br>
shapes at the connecting end of the outer tube are of course also conceivable. It<br>
is only important that between the adjacent outer tubes no gap or at least no<br>
large gap is formed, so that the outer tubes can gas-tightly be connected with<br>
each other inside the connecting tube, for instance by a welding seam.<br>
When the connecting end of the outer tube of the gas-carrying tube is<br>
plastically deformed after the inner tube has been attached, a hollow punch is<br><br>
-3-<br>
used, which includes a recess for the inner tube. In this way, the inner tube does<br>
not impair the plastic deformation of the outer tube.<br>
Depending on the requirements, the outer tube can be deformed to its final<br>
cross-section in a single embossing step, or several embossing steps can be<br>
used, which via several intermediate stages bring the end of the outer tube<br>
associated to the connecting tube into its final shape. A one-step forming method<br>
is characterized by particularly low costs. A multi-step forming method leads to a<br>
reduced axial compression of the outer tube.<br>
The invention will subsequently be described with reference to various<br>
embodiments which are illustrated in the attached drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows an assembly of the invention in a schematic top view;<br>
-	Figure 2 schematically shows a section along plane ll-ll of Figure 1;<br>
-	Figure 3 schematically shows the forming of the end of an outer tube<br>
associated to a connecting tube;<br>
-	Figures 4a to 4c show various cross-sectional shapes of the end of a gas-<br>
carrying tube associated to a connecting tube in a two-step forming method; and<br>
-	Figure 5 shows three gas-carrying tubes accommodated in one<br>
connecting tube in a view corresponding to that of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows two gas-carrying tubes 5 which are connected to a connecting<br>
tube 7. The two gas-carrying tubes 5 each include an outer tube 10 and an inner<br>
tube 12. The gas-carrying tubes in particular serve to carry exhaust gas of an<br>
internal combustion engine and also are referred to as air-gap-insulated exhaust<br>
tubes. The connecting tube 7 is of the single-sheeted type. The connecting tube<br>
also can be of the double- or multi-sheeted type. Connecting tube here is also<br>
meant to be a further exhaust-gas-carrying component, for instance the inlet or<br>
outlet funnel of a catalyst, a Diesel particulate filter, etc.. For better clarity, the<br>
walls of the various tubes are symbolized by a single line in all drawings, and<br>
between adjacent walls a space is shown, in order to better differentiate the<br>
individual components. The spacers disposed between the outer tube and the<br>
inner tube are not shown either.<br><br>
-4-<br>
For connection with the connecting tube, the two gas-carrying tubes 5 each<br>
include particularly shaped connecting ends 9, which are put into the connecting<br>
tube 7 adjacent to each other.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, at its end facing the gas-carrying tubes 5 the<br>
connecting tube 7 has a cross-section which resembles an oblong hole. At their<br>
connecting end facing the connecting tube 7, the outer tubes 10 of the gas-<br>
carrying tubes 5 each have a D-shaped cross-section. The two cross-sections<br>
are arranged such that they lie back to back. Thus, the two straight, vertical<br>
portions of the "D" rest against each other. The corresponding edges can be<br>
referred to as connecting edges, as they are welded to each other. The welding<br>
seam is indicated with the reference numeral 16. Away from the welding seam<br>
16, a further welding seam 17 extends in axial direction, which constitutes a fillet<br>
weld between the two outer tubes 10. The same extends approximately to the<br>
end of the connecting tube 7. The end of the connecting tube 7 is welded to the<br>
outer tubes 10 by a circumferential welding seam 18. In this way, a generally gas-<br>
tight connection is ensured between the gas-carrying tubes 5 and the connecting<br>
tube 7.<br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4 it will now be explained how the cross-<br>
sectional shape of the connecting end of each gas-carrying tube 5<br>
accommodated in the connecting tube 7 is obtained.<br>
The gas-carrying tube is inserted in a tool 20, which consists of an upper part<br>
22 and a lower part 24. The tool is designed such that it reliably clamps the outer<br>
tube 10. In the vicinity of the connecting end of the outer tube 10 to be<br>
accommodated in the connecting tube 7, the tool 20 includes a recess whose<br>
shape corresponds to the cross-section of the connecting end. In this region, a<br>
punch 26 is pressed into the outer tube 10, so that the same is expanded and<br>
deformed plastically. The punch 26 is a hollow punch with a recess 28 for the<br>
inner tube 12. At its front edge, the punch 26 is provided with two insertion edges<br>
29, 30 which facilitate insertion between the inner tube 12 and the outer tube 10.<br>
Forming the end of the outer tube 10 associated to the connecting tube can<br>
be effected in a single step or, as shown in Figures 4a to 4c, in several steps.<br>
Figure 4a shows the outer tube 10 with the inner tube 12 disposed therein,<br>
wherein the outer tube 10 is in the starting condition. Figure 4b shows the gas-<br><br>
-5-<br>
carrying tube 5 with the outer tube 10 formed into an intermediate condition. The<br>
cross-sectional shape of the outer tube approaches a "D". Figure 4c shows the<br>
gas-carrying tube with completely formed outer tube 10. The connecting edge 14<br>
has been formed, which is welded to the connecting edge 14 of the second gas-<br>
carrying tube 5.<br>
Figure 5 schematically shows an example of how three gas-carrying tubes<br>
can be connected with one connecting tube. The ends of the respective outer<br>
tubes 10 associated to the connecting tube 7 are formed such that they have a<br>
sector-shaped cross-section. With a suitable configuration of the connecting ends<br>
of the gas-carrying tubes it is also possible to connect more than three gas-<br>
carrying tubes with one connecting tube.<br><br>
