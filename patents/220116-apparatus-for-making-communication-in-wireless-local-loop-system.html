[0028] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0029]     The accompanying drawings,  which are  included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention: In the drawings:<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates related art separate type and integrated type WLL system; FIG. 2 illustrates a procedure for establishing a communication path in a WLL system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and,<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a WLL terminal in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0030] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Because a WLL system having the present invention applied thereto is identical to the related art WLL system in FIG. 1, explanation of the WLL system will be omitted. FIG. 2 illustrates a procedure for establishing a communication path in the WLL system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0031J      Referring to FIG. 2, when the WLL terminal 10 or 30. the origination terminal.<br><br>
is off-hooked (S10), an origination message inclusive of origination terminal information of the WLL terminal 10 or 30 is transmitted to the base station 40 (Sll) through the wireless access device in the WLL terminal 30 or the wireless access device 20 connected to the stationary telephone set 10.<br>
[0032] In this instance, the WLL terminal 10 or 30 attempts to obtain a communication channel (or a traffic channel) from the base station 40 by transmitting the origination message. The origination message includes no digit information provided from an origination terminal subscriber, i.e., the WLL terminal 10 or 30.<br>
[0033] The wireless access device 20 or 30 provides a local dial tone informing that the origination terminal information is transmitted to the WLL terminal 10 or 30 (SI3). Thus, a call is set up between the WLL terminal 10 or 30 and the base station 40 (SI 1). After the call is set up, the base station 40 and the switching center 70 exchange messages by using V5.2 signaling protocol (S12).<br>
[0034] After the call is set up, LE dial tone is provided from the switching center 70 to the wireless access device 20 or 30, continuously. The switching center 70 provides a preset signal for cutting off the LE dial tone to the wireless access device 20 or 30 for preventing the LE dial tone from being provided to a subscriber of the WLL terminal 10 or 30 subscriber (SI6).<br>
[0035] Then, in response to the tone cut off signal message, the wireless access device 20 or 30 leaves its vocoder inoperative. The subscriber cannot hear the LE dial tone until the subscriber of the WLL terminal 10 or 30 provides a last digit, and a certain time period is passed. That is, the subscriber cannot hear the LE dial tone until the wireless access device 10 or 30 provides a burst DTMF message including one of the digits or information corresponding to the digits to the base station 40. The WLL terminal 10 or 30<br><br>
has the call set up therefor, and the traffic channel assigned thereto (SI4).<br>
[0036] After the WLL terminal 10 or 30 is off-hooked (S10), the digits provided by the subscriber of the WLL terminal 10 or 30 are temporarily stored in a buffer in the wireless access device 20 or 30 until a certain time period is passed after a last digit is provided.<br>
[0037] At an end of the certain time period, the wireless access device 20 or 30 puts the vocoder into operation, and one of the digits and the information corresponding to the digits stored in the buffer (not shown) is provided to the base station 40 through the burst DTMF message (SI8). The information corresponding to the digits includes service information of the digits.<br>
[0038] In detail, the WLL terminal 10 or 30 analyzes the digits stored temporarily in the buffer. Then, the WLL terminal 10 or 30 provides one of the digits and information corresponding to the digits loaded on the DTMF message to the base station 40 through the wireless access device 20 or 30 for supporting services required from the subscriber according to a result of the analysis.<br>
[0039] The base station 40 provides a destination number (DTMF digits) to the switching center 70 based on the burst DTMF message, and the switching center 70 connects a call to a destination terminal of the destination number (SI 9).<br>
[0040] Upon receiving the destination number, the switching center 70 informs connection to the destination terminal by providing a ring back tone to the WLL terminal 10 or 30, the origination terminal, making a communication between the WLL terminal 10 or 30 and the destination terminal (S20).<br>
[0041] The foregoing embodiment of the present invention can be summarized as follows. If the WLL terminal 10 or 30, the origination terminal, is off-hooked in an overlap type dialing, the origination message is provided to the base station 40. to establish a call<br><br>
between the base station 40 and the WLL terminal 10 or 30. Then, when the wireless access device 20 or 30 provides one of the digits and digit information corresponding to the digits to the base station 40, the wireless access device 20 or 30 provides one of the digits and information corresponding to the digits to the base station 40 stored temporarily in the buffer if a certain time period is passed after the subscriber provides a last digit like an enblock type dialing.<br>
[0042] That is, the WLL terminal 10 or 30 can process the temporarily stored digits until one of the stored digits and information corresponding to the digits are transmitted after a certain time period is passed from a time the last digit is provided after the WLL terminal 10 or 30 is off-hooked.<br>
[0043] Accordingly, the present invention facilitates to use one of a speed dial function, an emergency call function, and an outgoing call lock function, which are enblock dial functions of the WLL terminal 10 or 30, during an overlap dialing in the WLL system. The WLL terminal 10 or 30 can implement functions that require an origination number processing, such as a restrict call function, and a prefix dial function.<br>
[0044] The speed dial function, an abbreviated dialing function, is a function for transmitting required digits of a dial number by pressing a particular digit. The emergency call function, an emergency dialing function, is a function in which the origination terminal can not disconnect a call until a destination terminal disconnects the call when the WLL terminal 10 or 30 calls a number registered for an emergency call mode. The outgoing call lock function is a function in which a dialing from the WLL terminal 10 or 30 can be made only when a particular password, given to the WLL terminal 10 or 30 in advance by the subscriber, is applied to the WLL terminal 10 or 30. The call restrict function is a function in which the subscriber can restricts particular dialing numbers or areas. The prefix dialing<br><br>
function is a function in which the subscriber can make a facsimile mode dialing for dialing numbers starting with particular numbers.<br>
[0045] In the meantime, in the enblock dial function, an origination message is transmitted by an automatic dialing timer after the subscriber provides whole telephone number. After the origination message inclusive of the provided digits and dialing terminal information is provided to the base station, the traffic channel is obtained. A system of the foregoing WLL terminal is illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
[0046] Referring to FIG. 3, the WLL terminal of the present invention includes a terminal circuit 10 or 30 for processing a received data and a data to be transmitted, and a wireless access device 20 or 30 for wireless transmission/reception of the processed data to/from the base station 40.<br>
[0047] The wireless access device 20 or 30 includes a timer 300, a memory 200 for temporary storage of the digits provided by the subscriber, and a wireless access controlling part 100 for controlling the timer 300, and controlling to forward the digits stored in the memory 200 as the timer 300 ends. Thus, the present invention is an application of the enblock dial function.<br>
[0048] As has been explained, the method for making communication in a wireless local loop system of the present invention can reduce a load on a base station by making the terminal to analyze digits provided by a subscriber to support services the subscriber set, selectively.<br>
[0049] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the method for making communication in a wireless local loop system of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, rhus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this<br><br>
