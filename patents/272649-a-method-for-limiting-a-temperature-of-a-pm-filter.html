				<td>CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A PARTICULATE MATTER FILTER<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to particulate matter (PM) filters,<br>
and more specifically, to systems and methods for limiting a temperature of a PM<br>
filter.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulate matter (PM)<br>
that is filtered from exhaust gas by a PM filter. The PM filter is disposed in an<br>
exhaust system of the engine. The PM filter reduces emission of PM that is<br>
generated during combustion.<br>
[0004] Over time, the PM filter becomes full. During regeneration, the<br>
PM may be burned within the PM filter. Regeneration may involve heating the<br>
PM filter to a combustion temperature of the PM. There are various ways to<br>
perform regeneration including modifying engine management, using a fuel<br>
burner, using a catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature with after<br>
injection of fuel, using resistive heating coils, and/or using microwave energy.<br>
[0005] The increased temperature of the PM filter during regeneration<br>
may exceed the temperature at which the collected PM combusts without<br>
exceeding the temperature at which the PM may be damaged. For example, PM<br>
 <br>
from a diesel engine may combust at temperatures of 550 degrees Celsius (°C)<br>
or above while a PM filter such as one employed in a full-size pickup truck may<br>
be damaged at temperatures as low as 800°C.<br>
[0006] High PM filter temperatures may also occur in situations other<br>
than regeneration. Fault conditions may exist such that the PM filter temperature<br>
unintentionally rises during vehicle operation to a level that may damage the PM<br>
filter if continued for a period of time. Examples of other fault conditions that may<br>
occur in a diesel vehicle include an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve leaking<br>
or sticking open, or leaks in the EGR gasket, turbocharger, intake manifold<br>
gasket, fuel injectors, charge air cooler (CAC), CAC pipes, or CAC hoses. In<br>
general, the PM filter temperature may rise to a potentially damaging level during<br>
any underboost or overfueling condition that results in abnormally high exhaust<br>
gas temperatures.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A method comprises determining a temperature of a particulate<br>
matter (PM) filter in communication with an exhaust gas from an engine; and<br>
reducing a power output of the engine when the PM filter is not being<br>
regenerated and the temperature exceeds a first predetermined temperature.<br>
[0008] A control module comprises a PM filter temperature<br>
determination module that determines the temperature of a PM filter in<br>
communication with an exhaust gas from an engine; and a reduced engine<br>
power module in communication with the PM filter temperature determination<br>
 <br>
module that reduces the power output of the engine when the PM filter is not<br>
being regenerated and the temperature exceeds a first predetermined<br>
temperature.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way. The<br>
present teachings will become more fully understood from the detailed<br>
description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0011] Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary vehicle;<br>
[0012] Figure 2 is a block diagram of a control module of a vehicle; and<br>
[0013] Figure 3 is a flow diagram describing steps in control system for<br>
a PM filter.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the present teachings, applications, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to<br>
identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
 <br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated or group) and memory that execute one or more software or<br>
firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components<br>
that proved the described functionality.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. Vehicle 10 may include engine 12 in communication<br>
with intake system 14, exhaust system 16, fuel system 18, and control module<br>
36. Intake system 14 may include intake manifold 22 and throttle 24. Exhaust<br>
system 16 may include exhaust manifold 26 in communication with PM filter 30,<br>
as well as one or more PM filter temperature sensors such as PM filter inlet<br>
sensor 38 and PM filter outlet sensor 40. Control module 36 may be in<br>
communication with engine 12, fuel system 18, throttle 24, PM filter inlet sensor<br>
38 and PM filter outlet sensor 40.<br>
[0016] For purposes of illustration, vehicle 10 will be described as<br>
having a diesel engine 12. Although vehicle 10 is disclosed with a diesel engine<br>
12, it should be understood that the present disclosure applies to other types of<br>
engines in vehicles 10 that include a PM filter 30.<br>
[0017] Throttle 24 may control air flow into diesel engine 12 and fuel<br>
system 18 may control a fuel flow into diesel engine 12. Exhaust gas created by<br>
combustion of the air/fuel mixture may exit diesel engine 12 through exhaust<br>
system 16. PM filter inlet sensor 38 and PM filter outlet sensor 40 may provide<br>
signals to control module 36 indicative of the temperature of the exhaust gas at<br>
the inlet and outlet of the PM filter 30.<br>
 <br>
[0018] Referring to Figure 2, a block diagram of control module 36 is<br>
depicted. Control module 36 may include PM filter temperature determination<br>
module 42 and reduced engine power module 44. PM filter temperature<br>
determination module 42 may be in communication with reduced engine power<br>
module 44 and may receive information from the PM filter inlet sensor 38 and/or<br>
PM filter outlet sensor 40, as discussed below. Reduced engine power module<br>
44 may be in communication with throttle 24 and fuel system 18 to control the<br>
power of diesel engine 12.<br>
[0019] Referring to Figure 3, a flow diagram of steps in a control<br>
system for a PM filter is depicted in control logic 100. At block 102, PM filter<br>
temperature determination module 42 may monitor PM filter inlet sensor 38<br>
and/or PM filter outlet sensor 40 to determine a PM filter 30 temperature. Control<br>
logic 100 may then continue to block 104.<br>
[0020] At block 104, reduced engine power module 44 may use the PM<br>
filter 30 temperature determined from PM filter temperature determination<br>
module 42 at block 102 to analyze whether the PM filter 30 temperature is at a<br>
level that requires corrective action. More specifically, block 104 may compare<br>
the determined PM filter temperature to a temperature value that operates as a<br>
shut down limit. The value of the shut down limit may be a temperature at which<br>
continued diesel engine 12 operation at any power level may produce an exhaust<br>
gas that results in damage to PM filter 30, such as a temperature approaching<br>
800 °C for an exemplary full-size pickup.<br>
 <br>
[0021] If the determined PM filter 30 temperature exceeds the shut<br>
down limit, control logic 100 may continue to block 106. At block 106, reduced<br>
engine power module 44 may gradually shut down diesel engine 12 by gradually<br>
ceasing to supply fuel and air from fuel system 18 or intake system 14 to diesel<br>
engine 12. Before shut down occurs, a chime, message or other indication may<br>
be provided to the driver to indicate that a gradual shut down will be occurring. If<br>
the determined PM filter 30 temperature does not exceed the shut down limit,<br>
control logic 100 may continue to block 108.<br>
[0022] At block 108, reduced engine power module 44 may use the PM<br>
filter 30 temperature determined from PM filter temperature determination<br>
module 42 at block 102 to analyze whether the PM filter temperature is at a level<br>
such that vehicle 10 may continue to operate but only at an idle speed. More<br>
specifically, block 108 may compare the determined PM filter 30 temperature to a<br>
temperature value that operates as an idle limit. The value of the idle limit may<br>
be a temperature at which continued operation of diesel engine 12 at an engine<br>
speed greater than an idle may continue to increase an exhaust temperature to a<br>
level that may contribute to damage to PM filter 30. In an exemplary full-size<br>
pickup, the idle limit may be approximately 750"C.<br>
[0023] If the determined PM filter 30 temperature exceeds the idle limit,<br>
control logic 100 may continue to block 110. At block 110, reduced engine power<br>
module 44 may force diesel engine 12 to operate at an idle speed by controlling<br>
intake system 14 and fuel system 18 to provide air and fuel sufficient to operate<br>
 <br>
diesel engine 12 at an idle speed. If the determined PM filter 30 temperature<br>
does not exceed the idle limit, control logic 100 may continue to block 112.<br>
[0024] At block 112, reduced engine power module 44 may use the PM<br>
filter 30 temperature determined from PM filter temperature determination<br>
module 42 at block 102 to analyze whether the PM filter 30 temperature is at a<br>
level such that the vehicle may continue to operate up to a reduced power limit.<br>
More specifically, block 112 may compare the determined PM filter 30<br>
temperature to a temperature value that operates as a power limiting threshold.<br>
The value of the power limiting threshold may be a temperature at which diesei<br>
engine 12 may continue to operate at a power requested by the operator up to a<br>
reduced power limit below which normal vehicle operation should not create<br>
exhaust that damages PM filter 30. In an exemplary full-size pickup the power<br>
limiting threshold may be 700°C.<br>
[0025] If the determined PM filter 30 temperature exceeds the power<br>
limiting threshold, control logic 100 may continue to block 114. At block 114,<br>
reduced engine power module 44 may limit the power of diesei engine 12 by<br>
controlling intake system 14 and fuel system 18 to provide air and fuel as needed<br>
to operate diesei engine 12 up to a reduced power limit at which further air and<br>
fuel will not be supplied to diesei engine 12. If the determined PM filter 30<br>
temperature does not exceed the power limiting threshold, control logic 100 may<br>
then be ended.<br>
[0026] Those skilled in the art may now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
that the broad teachings of the present disclosure may be implemented in a<br>
 <br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the disclosure<br>
should no be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
