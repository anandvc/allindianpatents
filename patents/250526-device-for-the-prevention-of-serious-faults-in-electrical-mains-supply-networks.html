				<td>Device for prevention of major disturbances in Electrical supply Networks<br>
Description<br>
The following invention relates to a device for prevention of major disturbances in electricity distribution networks with the characteristics covered by the Generic description of Claim 1.<br>
In the last years, the research has had to increasingly get confronted with the dynamic of electricity supply networks. In this context what is of special interest is the analysis of non-linear systems with reference to their effectiveness for arriving at patterns about the stability of electrical supply networks. In the IEEE-Report "voltage Stability Assessment: Concepts, Practices and Tools, August 2002" a few reserves in this respect have been summarized and significant bibliography / references have been made.<br>
The quintessence of these investigations and additional stimulations and analysis on network models have revealed that certain stimulation / activation in electro-energy system bring about dynamic transient reaction of phenomenon, with characteristic properties. These are to be recognized, in order to identify the stimulating occurrence. It has also emerged that a total collapse phenomenon which could lead to major disruptions, reveals itself always through a series of dynamic occurrences identifiable in advance. The special influence of load dynamics on the limits of stability and fluctuation dynamics was ascertained through bifurcation analysis.<br>
The fact that the collapse happens only 15 s to 300 s after the identifiable dynamic occurrences, offers a buffer for prevention of major disruptions. During this period, an underlying drift process is entered, a constant increase or decrease of the voltage.<br>
From the patent document W O 96/35250, a device is known for detecting of spark discharges on electrical energy lines, in order to warn against potential disruptions. A frequency analysis is carried out using filters and a spark discharge is blocked if high frequency broad band disruption signals are recognized.<br>
In accordance with the invention, in contrast, the dynamic transient reactions causing the major disruption are examined through a spectral analysis of the voltage. In this process it is of special importance to divide the spectrum in several frequency interval classes. The frequency interval classes must be so divided, that the different types of disruptions are capable of being imaged through significant differences in the frequency interval classes.<br><br>
On the basis of stimulation and analyses of network models and evaluation of literature, the frequency interval classes for supply networks with nominal frequency with 50 hz are specified as follows:<br><br>
In special cases it is necessary to match the frequency interval classes adaptively to the load and fluctuation dynamics of the supply network. For this purpose, online bifurcation analysis must be carried out.<br>
The recognition and analysis of disturbances is based according to the invention on the fact that corollary to the different disruptions certain frequency interval classes -referenced specimens get developed. Examples of such specimens are:<br>
Intermediate system fluctuations<br><br><br>
Super Synchrone modes Torsion Fluctuations<br><br>
The device for prevention of major disruptions in electrical distribution networks (7) (figure 1) consists of the AD-Transducer (2), which scans the voltage of the rotary current network (1) and provides the scan results to the Spectral Analysis-Device (3) and the voltage measuring instrument (11). The spectral analysis-device (3) computes the voltage values of the spectrum to be analyzed, relevant to the individual frequency interval and forwards this further to the Comparison device (4). This compares the Interval values with the above mentioned Frequency-Specimens (5) stored in conjunction with the adjustable limit value for the interval values. If the comparison indicates an impending disruption then the signal is transmitted to the evaluation device (6) in which the strategy for tackling the disturbance is specified. For the purpose of adaptation of the frequency interval classes with reference to their frequency limit values, the scan results are transferred to a bifurcation analyzer (12), which then forwards this spectral analysis-device (3) with the new frequency limits.<br>
For the purpose of judging the underlying drift process, the scan values are fed through the voltage measurement device (11) to the evaluation-device (6). The specific nominal frequency of a supply network is similarly obtained using the spectral analysis-device (3).<br>
There are several possibilities for the strategy for rectifying the disturbance. For one, messages can be issued through visual indications, relay outputs or corresponding communication interfaces. For the other, through the relay output and /or the communication interfaces the device in the voltage regulation (8) can be accessed through the step-switch (9) of the transformer (10). In the event of recognizing a possible major disturbance, either the controlling device can be stopped or can assume a desired value at the lowest possible limit, in order to act against the impending collapse.<br>
The device for prevention of major disruption in electrical supply networks (7) and the regulating device (8), can be connected also through corresponding communication interfaces in network management concepts for a coordinated handling of disruptions, in which event, the device (7) is put out or its information is called and processed in the instrumentation or SCADA-system, and the controller is set to a Master-Mode and the desired value stipulation from the instrumentation of SCADA-System is adopted.<br>
