INDOLE COMPOUNDS AS AN INHIBITOR OF CELLULAR NECROSIS<br>
i I Technical Field I i<br>
The present invention relates to indole compounds of formula (1), pharmaceutically acceptable salts or isomers thereof, and method and composition for the prevention or treatment of cellular necrosis and necrosis-associated diseases comprising the same as an active ingredient.<br>
I ! Background Art I 1<br>
Most researches associated with cell death have been concentrated on apoptosis of cells, also known as programmed cell death (PCD). With the discovery of the enzyme caspase, a number of pharmaceutical companies have promoted the development of drugs utilizing caspase inhibitors during the past 10 years. However, the current status is that there have hardly been any of these drugs approved by FDA. This is because the apoptosis of cells is a cell death which occurs under physiological circumstances and such a cell death may be probably due to the defense mechanism for maintaining homeostasis in the body. In contrast, necrosis is a cell death which mainly occurs under morbid circumstances, and in most cases it is characterized by accompanying the inflammatory response. Necrosis has been known as an uncontrolled cell death for a long time, but a recent research (Proskurykakov SY et al. 2002, Biochemistry) reported the necrosis as an active/controlled cell death. Typical diseases caused by necrosis include ischemic (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, renal infarction), neurodegenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Since it is believed that<br>
 <br>
necrosis is an uncontrolled, accidental cell death under morbid circumstances, researches on the functional mechanism, molecular targets, signal transduction systems, etc. thereof have rarely been conducted. Thus, there arises a compelling need to discover and develop the necrosis-inhibiting substances for the treatment of ischemic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory diseases which are caused by necrosis, and to elucidate the biological, pathological causes of necrosis.<br>
The indole derivatives according to the present invention have very useful structures from a medical viewpoint and many publications have reported the research results with reference to these structures. Among the research results, the following are the most representative of all: the patent WO2006/112549 reported some indole derivatives having the activity for the glucokinase, the patent WO95/07276 reported those useful as anti-tumor agents and as inhibitors against the production of cardiovascular system, and the patent WO2004/018428 reported those useful as antibiotics.<br>
' iDetailed Description of the Inventioni I I Technical Subject to be Solved I I<br>
Thus, the present inventors have extensively studied under the above mentioned technical background to develop new compounds that exhibit an effect of prevention or treatment and amelioration for cellular necrosis and necrosis-associated diseases, particularly useful for the prevention or treatment of hepatic diseases. As a result thereof, they confirmed that the indole derivatives of formula (1) as explained below show a superior effect for the prevention and treatment of cellular necrosis and necrosis-associated diseases, whereby completed the present invention.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new indole derivatives of formula (1).<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition for the prevention or treatment of cellular necrosis and necrosis-associated diseases, in particular, for hepatoprotection, hepatic functional improvement, and prevention or treatment of acute/chronic hepatic diseases, which comprises as an active ingredient the compounds of formula (1), pharmaceutically acceptable salts or isomers thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, and process for preparing the same.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for the prevention or treatment of cellular necrosis and necrosis-associated diseases, in particular, for hepatoprotection, hepatic functional improvement, and prevention or treatment of acute/chronic hepatic diseases using said composition.<br>

Experimental Example 1: Measurements and analysis of the Example compounds for the hepatocyte protective effect against the substances deriving hepatocyte toxicity.<br>
Various endogenous/exogenous attacks on the cells trigger the mechanisms of cell death which is broadly classified into two types, i.e. apoptosis or necrosis. Using these cell death mechanisms, in the present experimental example, primary hepatocytes isolated from rats were treated with drugs which were clinically shown to result in serious side-effects of hepatocyte toxicity or various chemicals which derive cell death, and the compounds synthesized in the Examples were estimated for their hepatocyte protective effects, after 24 - 48 h. The substances used to derive hepatocyte death include CCU, ActD, H2O2, doxorubicin, anti-Fas Ab/Actinomycin D, acetaminophen, EtOH, CdCh, palmitate, stearate, cyclophosphamide, terfenadine, diclofenac, simvastatin, and adefovir. Primary hepatocytes were isolated using the method of Seglen PO (Experimental Cell Research 74(1972) pp450-454). Briefly, hepatocytes were isolated according to the two-step coUagenase perfusion method, and dead cells were removed by low speed (500 rpm) centrifugation for 10 min using percoll gradient (Kreamer BL etc. In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology 22(1986) pp201-211). During this step, the viability of cells was maintained 90% or above. The cells were suspended in HepatoZYME media (Gibco BRL), and the number of cells was counted. 1.5X10'* cells in 100 I I were placed into the collagen-coated 96-well plate (BD biocoat), and adhered on the bottom for 3 - 4 h.<br>

After 24 - 48 h, the viability of cells was determined to estimate the hepatocyte protective effects. The viability of cells was determined using WST-1 (MK-400, Takeda) method by the absorbance at 440 nm. Hepatocyte protective effects of the Example compounds were represented by "ECso" which was calculated from measured values. "EC50" herein means the concentration of the compound at which 50% of maximum protective effect is observed in the experiment.<br>
