FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to wireless<br>
communications, and more specifically to synchronizing audio and<br>
videos signals played on separate devices, for example, on a handheld<br>
electronic device and a wireless headset.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Currently, many Bluetooth enabled mobile phones support<br>
a suite of basic functionality such as the Headset/Hands-Free profiles<br>
for enabling hands-free calling, certain OBEX functionality for pushing,<br>
pulling, and transferring files, and some type of serial connection for<br>
generic access. Most of these phones also support to some degree<br>
media content such as MP3 and other format audio clips. Some<br>
Bluetooth enabled phones also have the capability to play MP4 type<br>
media content, which combines video, audio, and metadata in the same<br>
file. However, audio and video synchronization problems may occur<br>
when video content is viewed on a cell phone display or other host<br>
device and the accompanying audio content is played on a wireless<br>
headset. For example, streaming stereo quality audio from a media<br>
device like a cell phone or personal computer via Bluetooth to a stereo<br>
headset requires the use of the Generic Audio Video Access Profile<br>
(GAVDP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), and the Audio<br>
Video Distribution Transport Protocol (ADVTP). A2DP requires use of<br>
a sub-band coding (SBC) scheme to ensure interoperability between all<br>
Bluetooth devices. If music files are stored on a phone in MP3 format,<br>
they generally are transcoded to SBC in order to stream the audio using<br>
A2DP. The transcoding of the audio content and the transmission<br>
thereof to the wireless headset introduces latency that affects<br>
synchronization. Synchronization may also be affected by the re-<br>
transmission of data between the host device and the headset and by<br>
the subsequent processing of the audio content on the headset.<br>
[0003] The various aspects, features and advantages of the<br>
disclosure will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art upon careful consideration of the following Detailed<br>
Description thereof with the accompanying drawings described below.<br>
The drawings may have been simplified for clarity and are not<br>
necessarily drawn to scale.<br>

[0008] FIG. 5 is a process flow diagram for determining whether a<br>

multimedia device.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009] In FIG. 1 illustrates a handheld multimedia device 100 that<br>
is communicably coupled to a remote audio device 102 wherein video<br>
content is presented on the multimedia device and related audio<br>
content is presented on the remote audio device. The exemplary<br>
multimedia device is a mobile telephone including at least a video<br>
player capable of playing video content. More generally, however, the<br>
device 100 includes a multimedia player 104 capable of presenting<br>
audio and video content. In other embodiments, the multimedia device<br>
is any host device capable of presenting at least video content and<br>
communicating with a remote audio device capable of presenting the<br>
accompanying audio content. In one implementation, the multimedia<br>
device supports MP4 multimedia content or some other multimedia<br>
format content. MP4 is a container format that combines video, audio<br>
and metadata. The remote audio device 102 may be implemented as an<br>
audio headset or some other audio device capable of communicating<br>
with the host device. In one embodiment, the remote audio device<br>
communicates wirelessly with the host device, although in other<br>
embodiments, the devices communicate via wire-line. The remote<br>
audio device generally supports an audio format provided by the host<br>
device as discussed further below.<br>
[00010] In one embodiment, the multimedia device wirelessly<br>
communicates with the remote audio device in compliance with the<br>
Bluetooth protocol. In other embodiments, however, these devices<br>
communicate pursuant to some other open or proprietary wireless or<br>
wire-line communication protocol. In some instances, synchronization<br>
problems may occur when the video component of the multimedia file<br>
is presented on a user interface of the multimedia device and the<br>
accompanying audio component is presented on the remote device. As<br>
suggested, propagation delay associated with the transmission of the<br>
audio component from the multimedia device to the remote audio<br>
device may result in an unacceptable lack of synchronization. The<br>
propagation delay may also be affected by the re-transmission of bad or<br>
lost data between the host device and the remote audio device.<br>
Propagation delay may also be affected by changing channel conditions,<br>
for example, in mobile applications where the host device<br>
communicates wirelessly with the remote audio device.<br>
[00011] The local processing of audio content at the multimedia<br>
device and/or at the remote audio device may also adversely affect<br>
synchronization. In some implementations, for example, streaming<br>
stereo quality audio from a multimedia device via Bluetooth to a stereo<br>
headset requires the use of the Generic Audio Video Access Profile<br>
(GAVDP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), and the Audio<br>
Video Distribution Transport Protocol (ADVTP). A2DP requires sub-<br>
band coding (SBC) to ensure interoperability between Bluetooth<br>
devices. Some audio file formats, for example, MP3, stored on the<br>
multimedia device are generally transcoded to SBC in order to use<br>
A2DP. In other embodiments, other audio and video protocols may be<br>
used. Transcodsing of the audio content on the host device for whatever<br>
reason nevertheless introduces latency that may have an adverse affects<br>
audio and video synchronization. Synchronization may also be affected<br>
by processing of the audio at the remote audio device.<br>
[00012] In FIG. 1, the multimedia device includes a separating<br>
entity 106 coupled to the multimedia player. The separating entity is<br>
configured to separate a multimedia stream into audio frames and<br>
video frames. In one implementation, the multimedia content input to<br>
the separating entity is read from a storage device on the multimedia<br>
device. In other implementations, the multimedia content is streamed<br>
from a remote source. In the latter implementation, the multimedia<br>
content may be streamed over a wire-line or wireless network. The<br>
streamed content may originate from any source, for example, a DVB-H<br>
or other broadcast source, or it may be streamed from a content server<br>
connected to the Internet or over some other network. In other<br>
implementations, the multimedia content may be obtained from some<br>
other source, for example, from a recording device communicably<br>
coupled to the multimedia device. The disclosure is not intended to be<br>
limited to a particular multimedia content source.<br>
[00013] In FIG. 1, the multimedia device 100 also includes a<br>
sequencing entity 108 having an input coupled to an output of the<br>
separating entity. In one embodiment, the sequencing entity 108 is<br>
configured to add a sequence number to at least one of the audio<br>
frames. In other embodiments, a sequence number is also added to at<br>
least one of the video frames. More generally, a sequence number may<br>
be added to every nth audio frame and to every nth video frame, where<br>
n is some integer value greater than 0. In some embodiments, the<br>
sequence numbers added to audio and video frames may be used to<br>
assess the synchronization between the audio and video frames during<br>
playback as discussed more fully below.<br>
[00014] In FIG. 1, the video player 104 is coupled to the separating<br>
entity 106 wherein the video player is configured to present video<br>
frames received from the separating entity at a user interface of the<br>
device, for example, at a video display thereof. In FIG. 1, the video<br>
player 104 is coupled to the sequencing entity 108 wherein the<br>
sequencing entity communicates the video frames to the video player<br>
104 via a buffer entity 114. In other implementations the video player is<br>
coupled directly to the separating entity 106 wherein the separating<br>
entity communicates the video frames to the video player via the buffer<br>
entity 114. In embodiments where the video frames are routed to the<br>
video player via the sequencing entity, the sequencing entity may or<br>
may not add sequence numbers to the video frames depending upon<br>
the particular implementation.<br>
[00015] In some embodiments, the multimedia device includes a<br>
transcoding entity for implementations where transcoding may be<br>
necessary. In some instantiations, for example, audio file formats stored<br>
on the multimedia device may be transcoded to another format before<br>
transmission to the remote audio device. In some embodiments, noted<br>
above, MP3 format audio frames are transcoded to SBC in order to use<br>
A2DP. In other embodiments, the transcoder entity transcodes other<br>
audio formats. In FIG. 1, the exemplary host device includes a<br>
transcoding entity 109 for transcoding audio frames. The delay<br>
associated with transcoding on the host device and remote audio device<br>
is discussed further below.<br>
[00016] In FIG. 1, the host device 100 comprises a transceiver 110<br>
coupled to the sequencing entity 108. In one embodiment, the<br>
transceiver is a wireless transceiver, for example, a Bluetooth or some<br>
other protocol wireless transceiver. More generally however, the<br>
transceiver may be a wire-line transceiver. The transceiver is generally<br>
configured to transmit audio frames to the remote audio device. Upon<br>
receipt, the remote audio device presents the audio frames at a user<br>
interface thereof, for example, at an earpiece transducer. In some<br>
embodiments, the audio frames may be processed at the remote audio<br>
device before presentation to the user.<br>
[00017] The video frames presented at the user interface of the host<br>
multimedia device are preferably synchronized with audio frames<br>
presented at the user interface of the remote audio device. In the instant<br>
disclosure, synchronization means that the presentation of the audio<br>
frames and the accompanying video frames occurs within a specified<br>
time interval. The specified time interval is subjective since sensitivity<br>
to synchronization may vary somewhat among users. The specified<br>
time interval is generally selected such that there is no appreciable user<br>
perceptible lack of synchronization for at least a majority of users. Any<br>
delay between the presentation of the video frames and accompanying<br>
audio frames outside the specified time interval is unsynchronized.<br>
According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the presentation of<br>
unsynchronized audio and video frames is reduced and preferably<br>
eliminated at least with respect to the subjectively specified time<br>
interval.<br>
[00018] In FIG. 1, the multimedia device also includes a controller<br>
112 coupled to the video player 104. The controller is configured<br>
generally to determine whether the video frames and accompanying<br>
audio frames are synchronized and also to control the presentation of<br>
the video and/or audio frames in a manner to reduce or eliminate a<br>
lack of synchronization. In one embodiment, the controller is<br>
configured to determine a delay associated with transmitting audio<br>
frames to the remote audio device based upon a sequence number<br>
added to one or more of the audio frames. The controller is also<br>
configured to control the presentation of the video frames at the video<br>
player based on the delay. In one embodiment, the controller delays the<br>
presentation of the video frames on the user interface of the multimedia<br>
device to synchronize the presentation of the audio frames at the remote<br>
device with the video frames at the host device.<br>
[00019] In FIG. 1, the host device 100 includes a buffer and delay<br>
entity 114 coupled to the video player 104. In one embodiment the<br>
buffer and delay entity is part of the video player. In other<br>
embodiments, however, the buffer and delay entity 114 is separate. The<br>
controller 112 is coupled to the buffer and delay entity 114 and thus the<br>
controller is coupled to the video player 104 via the entity 114. In one<br>
embodiment, the controller 112 controls the presentation of the video<br>
frames based on the transmission delay by providing control signals to<br>
the buffer and delay entity 114, wherein the control signal delays the<br>
transfer of the video signals to the video player.<br>
[00020] In one implementation, the controller determines the<br>
propagation delay by measuring a transmission time of the audio<br>
frames having the sequence number to the remote audio device. In the<br>
particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, at 210, the controller selects<br>
an outgoing frame and initiates a delay timer at 220 before or at the time<br>
the selected audio frame is transmitted. The selected audio frame has a<br>
sequence number. In FIG. 1, the controller 112 is coupled to the<br>
transcoding entity 109. In one embodiment, the controller starts the<br>
timer upon obtaining the sequence number of the audio frame from the<br>
transcoding entity. Starting the timer before transcoding accounts for<br>
delay associated with transcoding on the host device. Alternatively, the<br>
timer could be initiated after transcoding, for example, upon<br>
transmission of the audio frame. Thus in some embodiments it may not<br>
be necessary to couple the controller to the transcoding entity. In some<br>
implementations, for example, the sequencing entity may transfer the<br>
audio frames directly to the controller whereupon the controller obtains<br>
the sequence number from the audio frame.<br>
[00021] In FIG. 1, the host device 100 transmits the selected audio<br>
frame having the sequence number to the remote audio device. In FIG.<br>
2, in embodiments where the remote audio device sends an<br>
acknowledgement to the host device for each audio frame transmitted,<br>
the controller waits for an acknowledgement at 230. The<br>
acknowledgement identifies the frames having the sequence number,<br>
thus enabling the controller to determine the delay associated with the<br>
corresponding audio frame. At 240, the controller stops the timer upon,<br>
or sometime after, receipt of the acknowledgment. At 250, the<br>
controller determines the transmission delay. The timer generally<br>
measures the round-trip delay of the audio frames having the sequence<br>
number. Depending upon when the timer is initiated, the timer may<br>
also measure transcoding delay, which is generally fixed for a particular<br>
frames size. These and other fixed delay may be subtracted from the<br>
timer period to permit accurate determination of the one-way ¦<br>
transmission delay. The one-way transmission delay may also be<br>
added to local and/or to remote processing delays. The transmission<br>
delay alone or combined with other delay may be used to control the<br>
presentation of the video frames, for example, by delaying the<br>
presentation of the video frames. In some applications the transmission<br>
delay may vary as a result of variations in the channel. Thus in these<br>
and other applications the controller may track or measure the<br>
transmission delay periodically and make corresponding adjustments<br>
to the presentation of the video frame on the host device. In one<br>
implementation, the controller correlates the transmission delay<br>
associated with the audio frames to a number of video frames<br>
consumed. When the delay exceeds some threshold, the controller<br>
delays the transfer of video frames presented to the video player in a<br>
manner that synchronizes the audio and video frames. In one<br>
embodiment, the video frames are delayed by inserting null frames into<br>
the sequence of frames. In another embodiment, the video frames are<br>
delayed by repeating some or all of the video frames. The number of<br>
video frames that are repeated and or the repetition rate is generally<br>
dependent on the amount of delay that must be introduced.<br>
[00022] In another embodiment, the controller determines the delay<br>
by comparing a number of video and audio frames consumed over a<br>
period of time. The controller may count the number of audio frames<br>
consumed by monitoring the rate at which the buffer entity transfers<br>
video frames to the video player during a specified interval. The<br>
controller may count the number of audio frames consumed by<br>
monitoring the acknowledgments received from the remote audio<br>
device during a specified time interval. In embodiments where<br>
sequence numbers are added to the audio and video frames, the<br>
controller may count the audio and video frames by monitoring the<br>
sequence numbers of the audio and video frames. The controller delays<br>
the transfer of video frames presented to the video player in a manner<br>
that synchronizes the audio and video frames when the delay exceeds a<br>
specified threshold.<br>
[00023] In some embodiments, the controller delays the video<br>
frames for an estimated delay before determining the delay associated<br>
with transmitting the audio frames to the remote audio device. The<br>
estimated delay may be based upon one or more criteria. In one<br>
embodiment, the estimated delay is an estimate of the transmission<br>
delay between the host device and the remote audio device. In another<br>
embodiment, the estimated delay is an estimate of processing delay that<br>
occurs on the host device and/or processing delay that occurs on the<br>
remote device. In other embodiments, the estimated delay is an<br>
estimate of a combination of transmission delay and processing delay<br>
occurring on the host device and/or remote audio device. The<br>
estimated processing delay may be based for example on a particular<br>
type of transcoding. The estimated processing delay may also be based<br>
on a particular type of remote audio device, assuming that different<br>
devices have different processing delays. Thus, other than estimated<br>
transmission delays, the estimated processing delay may be based<br>
generally upon the capabilities of the remote audio device, since the<br>
capabilities of the remote audio device are indicative of the processing<br>
delay of the remote audio device and at least any transcoding delay that<br>
the host device must perform to accommodate the remote audio device.<br>
In one embodiment, the controller determines the estimated delay<br>
based upon delay information stored in a look-up table of the<br>
multimedia device. In implementations where the host device<br>
communicates with the remote audio device via Bluetooth, the host<br>
device may determine the remote audio device type upon linking the<br>
host device with the remote audio device. Thus in some applications,<br>
the remote audio device type may be used as a basis for selecting an<br>
estimated delay from a look-up table. FIG. 1 illustrates an estimated<br>
delay table 116 coupled to the controller 112.<br>
[00024] In FIG. 3, at 310, the controller begins the process of<br>
determining an estimated delay. This process may be initiated upon<br>
linking the host device with the remote audio device or upon some<br>
other event, preferably one that precedes that transmission of audio<br>
frames to the remote audio device. At 320, the controller obtained<br>
information that may form the basis for the estimated delay. The<br>
controller may then obtain estimated delay information from the look-<br>
up table. In other embodiments, the estimated delay is based on more<br>
than one estimated factor. For example, the controller may obtain<br>
remote audio device type information, media format information, etc.<br>
The controller may then obtain estimated delay information from the<br>
look-up table for each type of information. At 330, the controller<br>
computes the estimated delay, for example, by aggregating estimated<br>
delay information from the look-up table. At 340, the controller<br>
determines whether the computed estimated delay satisfies a condition,<br>
for example, is outside a specified time interval as discussed above. If<br>
the condition is satisfied, at 350, the controller 112 delays the<br>
presentation of the video frames based on the estimated delay via the<br>
video buffer and delay entity 114.<br>
[00025] In some embodiments, illustrated in FIG. 1, the host device<br>
100 includes an input 118 that permits the user to manually control or<br>
adjust synchronization. The manual synchronization input control may<br>
be used in combination with the synchronization control based on the<br>
estimated delay and/or measured delay.<br>
[00026] FIG. 4 is a general process flow diagram for synchronizing<br>
audio and video frames. At 410, the process is initialized upon<br>
initializing video or upon linking with the remote audio device. At 420,<br>
the delay estimator is initialized. An exemplary delay estimator is<br>
discussed above in connection with FIG. 3. In FIG. 4, at 430, delay<br>
between the consumption of the audio and video frames is monitored<br>
as discussed above in connection with FIG. 2. At 440, a determination is<br>
made as to whether any delay between the presentation or consumption<br>
of the audio and video frames exceeds a latency threshold. This<br>
threshold is related to, and in some embodiments corresponds to, the<br>
specified time interval that defines whether or not the audio and video<br>
frames are synchronized. At 450, any adjustment to the presentation of<br>
the video frames required for synchronization is provided. At 460, any<br>
user generated manual control over the synchronization of the audio<br>
and video frames is provided. As suggested above, the user generated<br>
manual control of the audio and video synchronization may be<br>
independent of any control based on the estimated or measured delay.<br>
At 470, the controller monitors various controls to be applied to the<br>
presentation of the video frames. At 480, the controller controls the<br>
presentation of the video frames based on the feedback presented.<br>
[00027] According to another aspect of the disclosure, the video<br>
frames and accompanying audio frames are synchronized by<br>
eliminating processing delay. The processing delay may be reduced in<br>
combination with or in lieu of delaying the presentation of video frames<br>
discussed above. In one embodiment, the multimedia device is<br>
compliant with a protocol that supports a mandator)7 audio encoding<br>
scheme. For example, some Bluetooth enabled multimedia devices are<br>
compliant with the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP). To<br>
ensure interoperability of these Bluetooth devices, content in a native<br>
format on the Bluetooth multimedia device is transcoded to SBC in<br>
order to stream the audio frames using A2DP. If the remote audio<br>
device supports the native coding format on the host device, the content<br>
may be transmitted to the remote audio device without transcoding<br>
thereby eliminating the delay associated with transcoding. In the case<br>
of the exemplary Bluetooth multimedia device, the delay associated<br>
with SBC transcoding may be eliminated, assuming that the remote<br>
audio device supports the native format of the host Bluetooth<br>
multimedia device.<br>
[00028] FIG. 5 illustrates a process for determining whether a<br>
remote audio device supports an audio format native to the audio<br>
content on the multimedia device. The process may be executed by a<br>
processor, for example, the processor 112 in FIG. 1. At 510, a video<br>
player or application is launched on the host multimedia device, which<br>
is enabled for Bluetooth compliant communications with a remote<br>
audio device. At 520, the audio encoding format of the stream of audio<br>
frames is identified. This audio encoding format may or may not be<br>
supported by the host multimedia device. At 530, the audio format<br>
supported by the remote audio device is obtained. The one or more<br>
audio codecs supported by the remote audio device is obtained by the<br>
host device, for example, from a look-up table stored on the host device.<br>
Alternatively, the remote audio device may communicate this<br>
information to the host device, for example, upon linking the devices.<br>
At 540, the audio format supported by the host device is obtained. The<br>
one or more audio codecs supported by the host device may be<br>
obtained from a look-up table stored on the host device. At 550, a<br>
determination is made as to whether the audio format of the<br>
multimedia content is supported by both devices. If both the host and<br>
remote audio devices support the audio format of the audio content, at<br>
560/ the audio frames are transmitted to the remote device in the native<br>
format. Alternatively, if the both devices do not support the native<br>
format of the multimedia content, the content is transcoded into a<br>
format support by both devices. In FIG. 5 at 570, the audio contents is<br>
transcoded using the SBC codec.<br>
