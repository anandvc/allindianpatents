In yet another aspect the present invention provides a process as herein described where in 5-15%w/w catalyst is used based on compound of formula (II) or (III).<br><br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
This Example illustrates a process for the preparation of4,6-dichloro-2-(propylthio)pyrimidin-5-aniine.<br><br>
A Pt[VIC catalyst (available from Degussa; about 3% Pt and 0.6% V adsorbed on charcoal, 30g) was charged to a vessel and the vessel was purged with nitrogen. 4,6-Dichloro-5-nitro-2-(propylthio)pyrimidine (302g) dissolved in tert-butyl methyl ether (31) was charged to the vessel and agitation was started. The resulting mixture was heated to an initial temperature of 300C and then the vessel was pressurised with hydrogen to 3 bar for 3 hours. After the completion of the hydrogenation the catalyst was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the title compound (254 g).<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
This Example illustrates a process for the preparation of 4,6-dichloro-2-(propylthio)pyrimidin-5-amine from 4,6-dichloro-5-jI(E)..(4-methylphenyl)diazenyl] -2-. (propylsnlfanyl)pyrimidine<br>
		 Cl				CI<br><br><br>
The Pt/C catalyst (33.3g, 10% w/w) was added to a reaction vessel that had been purged with nitrogen and maintained under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The solution of 4,6-dichloro-5-[(E)-2-(4-methylphenyl)diazenyl] -2-(propylsulfanyl)pyiimidine (1 SOg, 430.1 rumol) in ethyl acetate (3000m1) was added to the reaction vessel containing the catalyst and agitation was initiated. The inner temperature was adjusted to 200C, the nitrogen atmosphere was evacuated, and the vessel was pressurized with 3 bar of hydrogen (hydrogen pressure of 3<br><br>
bar was maintained throughout the reaction). The temperature was maintained at 200C for<br><br>
about 30 minutes and then it was increased to 400C and maintained for 150 minutes. When the reaction was complete (full conversion) the reaction solution was cooled to 200C and the catalyst filtered off under a nitrogen atmosphere. The catalyst was washed with ethyl acetate (300m1) and the filtered wash-solution was combined with the filtered reaction solution. The ethyl acetate solution was concentrated to Smi (ethyl acetate)/g (amine) under vacuum at a maximum temperature of 400C. The resulting solution was extracted twice with aqueous hydrochloric acid (about 3M; 700m1 and 375m1) until a pH of 1.5-2 was obtained. The concentration of the ethyl acetate layer, under vacuum, yielded about 93g of the 4,6-dichloro-2-(propylthio)pyrimidin-5-amine as a yellow oil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
