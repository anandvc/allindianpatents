				<td>The present invefion relates to a process for the preparation of olefin sulfonates.<br>
The invention is particularly related to the production of such sulfonates from<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons by reacting them with bisulfite in the presence of a free<br>
radical initiator and solvent reaction media. More particularly this invention relates to<br>
the preparation of alkane sulfonates using the addition of bisulfite ions to olefins present<br>
in the distillates from thermal cracking operations such as coker or visbreaking.<br>
The alkane sulfonates are effective as detergents. These detergents provide<br>
outstanding detergency, high compatibility with water, and good wetting and foaming<br>
properties. Alpha olefin sulfonates are free of skin irritants and sensitizers, and a great<br>
importance is their high degree of biodegradability. They are used in high quality<br>
shampoos, light-duty detergents, bubble baths and heavy-duty liquid and powder<br>
detergents. The product obtained by the present invention can be utilized by detergent<br>
industry specially used in personal care products.<br>
The addition of sodium bisulfite to unsaturated organic compounds has long been<br>
known. One of the early patents in which this reaction was used is Patent No. US<br>
2,028,091, which described the addition of sodium bisulfite to esters of maleic acid. The<br>
reaction is carried out by heating an aqueous alcoholic solution of sodium bisulfite and<br>
the maleic acid ester in a closed vessel.<br>
Several patents e.g. U.S. pat. Nos. 4,171,291; 3,356,717; 3,168,535; 3,349,122;<br>
4,070,396 describe the above mentioned reaction with olefin(s) in presence of peroxide<br>
initiators to form alkane sulfonates.<br>
It has long been further, known that the above mentioned reaction is feasible with alpha<br>
olefins, olefins with pendant or internal unsaturation. The pendant or internal olefins<br>
react at slower rate than alpha olefin and the rate of reaction is decreased with increase<br>
in the molecular weight of olefin. Such observations are reported in open literature<br>
(Chemical Reviews, 37, pp-351; Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Product<br>
Research and Development, No.1, March 1964, pp-3).<br>
Lot of work has been done to develop a process for the production of organic sulfonates<br>
by reaction of hydrocarbons with inorganic bisulfites. Need of such process is especially<br>
felt because oHM* high marketability of the product and the relatively low cost of the<br>
individual raw materials. Much of the work on the preparation of olefin sulfonates has<br>
been done in United States and in Britain, which is covered by numerous patents e.g. 2,<br>
653, 970; 3,084,186 and 3,168,555 and British Patent No. 995, 376. However, to our<br>
knowledge, no process for production of organic sulfonates by reaction of the<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons with inorganic bisulfites has been found sufficiently economic<br>
to be practiced on a commercial scale. All of the above cited patents need a emphasis<br>
precise control of the pH. Various ranges of pH have been found to be beneficial to the<br>
reaction forming organic sulfonates. The process disclosed in U.S. patent no.<br>
2,653,970 requires about from 16 to 40 hours for obtaining reasonable yields of sodium<br>
a Iky I sulfonate.<br>
German patent No. 1,098,936, French Patent No. 1,222,105 and U.S. patent no.<br>
3,084,186 claim the use of peroxide compounds as promoters to reduce the reaction<br>
time. Patent No. 3, 479, 397 discloses the use of nitrates as promoters. U. S. Patent.<br>
No. 3,541,140 describes the preparation of alkane sulfonates wherein the process is<br>
accomplished by pre-reacting the olefin with an oxygen containing gas and then<br>
reacting a non-interfering bisulfite with the pre-reacted olefin.<br>
The use of nitrates as promoters give rise to alkyl sulfonates containing nitrogen in an<br>
amount of about 1 g per alkyl chain and on a prior oxygenation of olefins gives rise to<br>
recycle products, which are no longer reactive with respect to bisulfite. French Patent<br>
No. 1,453,398 and U.S. Patent No. 3,450,749 claims the use of gamma or UV<br>
radiations, which do not give good yields and show some technological difficulties.<br>
Similarly, U. S. Patent No. 3,558,693 discloses the separation of alkane sulfonate<br>
product from the reaction mixture by maintaining a critical alcohol to water ratio and a<br>
critical temperature range. The U.S. Patent No. 2,504,411 discloses the necessity of<br>
maintaining certain molar ratios of bisulfite ions to olefins and of olefins to organic<br>
peroxide initiators and the importance of controlling the reaction temperature in rather<br>
narrow limits and pairing up the initiators with a specific solvent to obtain good yields of<br>
alpha olefin sulfonates. The U.S. Patent No. 3,084,186 describes the addition of<br>
bisulfites to olefins in a system to maintain fixed concentration of bisulfiite. This also<br>
requires regular analysis of the bisulfite ion during the course of reaction, which makes<br>
this process difficult and impractical.<br>
The important drawbacks associated with hitherto known processes can be summarized<br>
as:<br>
(i) Economically viable production of organic sulfonates has not been achieved so<br>
far.<br>
(ii) Reaction time is generally very high ranging from 16-40 hrs (U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,653,970).<br>
(iii) Reasonably high yield of product is not obtained.<br>
(iv) The high cost and non-availability of raw materials are other interfering factors for<br>
the large-scale production.<br>
(v) Sometimes very controlled reaction parameters (e.g. addition of bisulfite) make<br>
the process more tedious.<br>
(vi) Some of the process utilized nitrates as the initiators. The product thus obtained<br>
is associated with nitrogen, which makes the recycle of unreacted product more<br>
difficult.<br>
(vii) For rapid completion of the reaction controlled and gradual introduction of the<br>
bisulfite compound, which is usually a salt like ammonium or sodium bisulfite is<br>
necessary. It being stated that without such controlled introduction, long reaction<br>
times are required, extending upto 100 hours. These efforts, in turn, involved a<br>
careful supervision over the bisulfite concentration. Also, in order to check the<br>
rate of addition, aliquot portions of the reaction mixture were periodically<br>
withdrawn and tested as a pre requisite to the maintenance of the bisulfite<br>
concentration within desired limits. Such periodic tests were done as often as<br>
every 10 minutes.<br>
From the prior processes it may be seen that they are marked by tedious<br>
techniques, which result in increasing the cost of the product and prolong the<br>
reaction well beyond desired times. According to the present invention, it is<br>
proposed to eliminate completely the need for such careful control, including both<br>
the gradual addition of bisulfite and the periodic testing of the reaction mixture.<br>
All the reactants, are used in substantially near stoichiometric amounts, and are<br>
mixed in a single addition, there being no gradual or stepwise addition of<br>
reactants.<br>
The main object Cjpie present invention is to provide a process for preparation of olefin<br>
sulfonates which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for prepare olefin<br>
sulfonates by the addition of bisulfite ions to an alkene having at least 10 carbon atoms<br>
per molecule to form an alpha olefin sulfonates.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to use cracked distillates from thermal<br>
cracking processes containing alpha olefins without purification as a cheap and easily<br>
available source of olefins, e.g. mixed streams such as alpha olefins, paraffin mixtures<br>
obtained from kerosene/gas oil distillate fraction from thermal coking/visbreaking<br>
operations in a refinery which goes as a low value fuel component. Typically such<br>
mixed alpha olefins contain about 25-30% olefins, 70-75% paraffins and about 0.1-<br>
0.5% aromatics.<br>
For reasons of economics, we prefer to use sodium bisulfite in our process, but other<br>
water-soluble bisulfites, for example ammonium bisulfite or aliphatic amines or pyridine<br>
bisulfite may be used. Sodium bisulfite, while in general less reactive and more difficult<br>
to remove from the reaction products, is advantageous in the manner that the sodium<br>
alkane sulfonates formed are generally more effective as detergents. Further in the<br>
process, according to the present invention the manner in which feed and bisulfite are<br>
mixed is not critical or complicated. It is pointed out, however, that employing peroxides<br>
for the free radical initiation will result in rapid preferential reaction with the bisulfite. The<br>
importance of the free radical initiator is to selectively oxidize bisulfite to sulfite radicalion<br>
without formation of sulfate ion.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of olefin<br>
sulfonates which comprises reacting an alkali metal bisulfite with a hydrocarbon feed<br>
selected from one or more alpha olefins and a mixture of olefins and paraffins having<br>
10 to 18 carbon atoms in a molar ratio of feed to bisulfite in the range of 1:1 to 1:5 in a<br>
aqueous or non aqueous saturated monohybrid alcohol having one to four carbon<br>
atoms in the presence of peroxide having proxy group -O-O- attached to carbon<br>
bonded carbon atom of at least one organic radical, as a free radical forming catalyst in<br>
the range of 0.01 to 2.0 weight % of the olefin to obtain two phases disperse system at<br>
a temperature of 20-25°C, agitating the above said reaction mixture and slowly raising<br>
its temperature^lffb reflux temperature over a period of 1 to 2 hours and further<br>
maintaining the said elevated temperature for a period of 2 to 16 hours till the reaction<br>
mixture turns clear and water white to obtained the desired product.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the mixture of olefins and parffins used is<br>
obtained from the thermally cracked hydrocarbon distillate<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the bisulfite used is of the general<br>
formula MHSOa wherein M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or an ammonium<br>
ion.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention bisulfite used is selected from the<br>
group consisting of sodium bisulfite, ammonium bisulfite and sodium meta bisulfite.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the ratio of olefins to paraffins used<br>
is in the mixture of olefins and paraffins is in the range of 1:9 to 1:1.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the thermally cracked distillate used<br>
is consisting of olefins, saturated hydrocarbons and aromatics.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the catalyst used preferably is<br>
benzoyl peroxide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the catalyst used preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1-5% of olefin.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the temperature used preferably in<br>
the range of 70°C to 150°C.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the reaction is carried out preferably<br>
fora period 8-12 hrs.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention said monohydrate alcohol is<br>
selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and tertiary<br>
butanol.<br>
While the reaction can be carried out at normal temperatures, it is accelerated at<br>
increased temperatures. The temperatures preferred are those approaching the boiling<br>
point of the olefin solvent employed, which in the case of the above mentioned alcohols<br>
is in the range of about 70-82°C. A reflux condenser can be associated with the<br>
reaction vessel if it is anticipated that the temperature will possibly exceed the boiling<br>
point the solvent. After the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture can be subjected<br>
to separate saturated hydrocarbons followed by an evaporation step wherein water and<br>
organic solvent are separated from the product alpha olefin sulfonate. AOS yields of<br>
40-90 percent are obtained by the inventive process. The "yield" as the term is here in<br>
employed is the weight percent of olefin feed charged to the reaction zone converted to<br>
the alpha olefin sulfonate.<br>
The reaction is carried out by agitating an aqueous solution of the bisulfite with an<br>
alcoholic solution of the olefin at a temperature in the range from 25-100°C preferably<br>
somewhat less than the boiling point of the solvent and for a time sufficient to complete<br>
the bisulfite addition in the presence of free radical-forming initiating catalyst. The<br>
temperature, order of addition of the reactants and their ratio are not critical and as little<br>
as 0.01% of the catalyst based on the weight of olefin can be used. The amount of<br>
catalyst to be used is 0.5 to 5%, preferably less than 2% wt based on olefin. The<br>
alcoholic solution of feed was treated with aqueous solution of bisulfite wherein the<br>
bisulfite is of the general formula MHSO3 in which M is an alkali metal, alkaline earth<br>
metal or an ammonium preferably sodium bisulfite or ammonium bisulfite or sodium<br>
meta bisulfite. The mole ratio of bisulfite used varies from 0.5 - 5 mol % on the basis<br>
of olefin present in the feed.<br>
All the reactants can be introduced into the reactor gradually or at one time and by<br>
maintaining a concentration of the alcohol having Ci - C4 carbon atom and water<br>
varying from in the range 0-100% such that an excess of alcohol is not used or an<br>
insufficient amount of water is used for dissolving the bisulfite, a two-layer or two- phase<br>
rather than a three-phase system is provided. By agitating the two-phase system in<br>
which the catalyst acts at the interface, a turbid appearing dispersion of the phases is<br>
maintained and shortly before the reaction is completed, two clear phase results, and<br>
separate these layers The upper layer contain paraffin, unreacted olefins and others.<br>
The products of the instant invention encompass this clear solution, or a solid material<br>
resulting from the^paporation or distillation of the alcohol from the clear solution or a<br>
solid material resulting from the removal of both the alcohol and the water.<br>
In order to more fully illustrate the process of this invention and manner of practicising<br>
the same, the following examples are presented. The examples are provided for<br>
illustrative purposes and not to limit the invention as defined by the claims. The<br>
examples also demonstrate that the alpha olefins mixture containing Cio-Cia carbon<br>
atoms can also be used to prepare alpha olefin sulfonates using the present invention.<br>
The examples further demonstrate that the process of the present invention can also be<br>
used to prepare alpha olefin sulfonates by reaction alpha olefins-paraffin mixture<br>
obtained from thermally cracked petroleum streams obtained from coker operations and<br>
having Cio-Cia carbon atoms. In such a case only alpha olefins present in the cracked<br>
stream reacts to form sulfonates.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
Into a 500 ml three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a Teflon - bladed<br>
glass agitator and a thermometer, 31.2 g of sodium bisulfite, previously dissolved<br>
in 85 ml of water, was charged. There was then added 34.3g of<br>
1-tetradecene in 170 ml isopropyl alcohol and 0.4 g of benzoyl peroxide. The agitation<br>
was started and the temperature was gradually raised fro 25°C to 78°C over a period of<br>

hrs. Heating was continued for a period of 10 hrs. Two separate layers were obtained.<br>
The alcohol was distilled from the reaction mixture and these two layers were separated<br>
by separating funnel. The lower layer is a clear water white liquid. On evaporation of<br>

The procedure of Example-3 was carried out using 1-dodecene and dodecane mixture<br>
(30%: 70%) with 1.7 moles of bisulfite for 12 hrs. The product obtained was similar to<br>
that obtained in Example - 3. The conversion, basis consumed olefin, is found to be<br>
50%.<br>
Example-8<br>
The procedure of Example-3 was carried out using 1-dodecene and dodecane mixture<br>

(30%:70%) with 2.5 moles of bisulfite for 12 hrs. The product obtained was similar to<br>
that obtained in Example -3. The conversion, basis consumed olefin, is found to be<br>
95%.<br>
Olefins can be made to react with bisulfite in the presence of other hydrocarbons. No<br>
prior separation of olefins from a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is<br>
necessary.<br>
In the process of the invention an olefin having a carbon chain length of from 10 to 18,<br>
preferably an alpha-olefin, is reacted with bisulfite ions in a liquid medium, in the<br>
presence of a substance known to initiate said reaction, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) Forming a mixture of olefin and a co-solvent consisting of water and a short chain<br>
alcohol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms wherein the alcohol present is about<br>
10<br>
58% to ao'Ht 70% by weight of the co-solvent and the alcohol is present in an<br>
amount of from about 50% to about 100% by weight of the olefin,<br>
(ii) Adding an aqueous solution of bisulfite ions, containing 1-3 mols of bisulfite ion<br>
per mol of olefin and the alcohol is present in an amount from about 16% to<br>
about 19% by weight in the final reaction mixture, and<br>
(iii) Maintaining the reaction zone, is preferably at a temperature of from 70°C to<br>
100°C. The preferred alcohol is isopropyl alcohol and the amount of initiator is<br>
preferably not more than 0.1% to 2% relative to the olefin.<br>
Although this invention has been primarily described in conjunction with examples and<br>
by reference to embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications,<br>
and variants will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing<br>
description. Accordingly, it is intented to embrace within the invention all such<br>
alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. It has been found that the present process can be carried out efficiently and high<br>
yields can be obtained by charging all of the ingredients into the reaction vessel<br>
at the same time without undue regard for solvent selection, solvent<br>
concentration, time or temperature. Contrary to U. S. Patent No. 3, 084, 186 in<br>
which the rate of addition of the bisuphite to the olefin is strictly controlled and to<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,504,411 in which may factors are controlled, among them the<br>
temperature within narrow limits and the ratios of initiators solvents, and olefins.<br>
2. The present invention provides a process wherein the terminal olefins can be<br>
made to react almost quantitatively with bisulfite under the experimental<br>
conditions to produce alpha olefin sulfonates by using water-soluble bisulfites<br>
and olefins (obtained from coker distillates) containing from 10 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
3. Thus, the invention provides a simplified process which can be carried out at<br>
temperatures in the range suitable for atmospheric pressure operation utilizing a<br>
minimum amount of initiating catalyst and agitation to maintain a disperse system<br>
of the two-pKases during the course of the reaction, which generally runs from 2<br>
to 20 hours. Good yields of alpha olefin sulfonates are obtained.<br>
4. The main achievement of this process is the utilization of alpha olefins from<br>
cracked hydrocarbons i.e. alpha olefin-paraffin mixture, which is available in large<br>
quantities in refineries at a very cheaper rate and so far has not been utilized.<br>
5. The other usefulness of this process lies in the conversion of alpha olefins<br>
present in the alpha olefin-paraffin mixture into high marketability product i.e.<br>
alpha olefin sulfonates, a potential detergent type. No prior separation of alpha<br>
olefins from coker distillate is required.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. A process for the preparation of olefin sulfonates which comprises reacting an alkali<br>
metal bisulfite with a hydrocarbon feed selected from one or more alpha olefins and<br>
a mixture of olefins and paraffins having 10 to 18 carbon atoms in a molar ratio of<br>
feed to bisulfite in the range of 1:1 to 1:5 in a aqueous or non aqueous saturated<br>
monohybrid alcohol having one to four carbon atoms in the presence of peroxide<br>
having proxy group -O-O- attached to carbon bonded carbon atom of at least one<br>
organic radical, as a free radical forming catalyst in the range of 0.01 to 2.0 weight<br>
% of the olefin to obtain two phases disperse system at a temperature of 20-25°C,<br>
agitating the above said reaction mixture and slowly raising its temperature to reflux<br>
temperature over a period of 1 to 2 hours and further maintaining the said elevated<br>
temperature for a period of 2 to 16 hours till the reaction mixture turns clear and<br>
water white to obtained the desired product.<br>
2. A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the mixture of olefins and parffins used is<br>
obtained from the thermally cracked hydrocarbon distillate<br>
3. A process as claimed in claim 1-2 , wherein the bisulfite used is of the general<br>
formula MHSOs wherein M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or an ammonium<br>
ion.<br>
4. A process as claimed in claim 1-3 wherein bisulfite used is selected from the group<br>
consisting of sodium bisulfite, ammonium bisulfite and sodium meta bisulfite.<br>
5. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the ratio of olefins to paraffins used<br>
in the mixture of olefins and paraffins is in the range of 1:9 to 1:1.<br>
6. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein the thermally cracked distillate used<br>
is consisting of olefins, saturated hydrocarbons and aromatics.<br>
7. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 6 wherein the catalyst used preferably is benzoyl<br>
peroxide.<br>
8. A process as ciaimed in claims 1 to 7, wherein the catalyst used is preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1-5% of olefin.<br>
9. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 8, wherein the temperature used is preferably in<br>
the range of 70°C to 150°C.<br>
10. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 9, wherein the reaction is carried out preferably<br>
for a period 8-12 hrs.<br>
11.A process as claimed in claims 1 to 10, wherein said monohydrate alcohol is<br>
selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and tertiary<br>
butanol.<br>
12. A process for the preparation of olefin sulfonates substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to the examples accompanying this specification.<br></td>
