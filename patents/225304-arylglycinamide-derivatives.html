The invention therefore also relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention as remedies and pharmaceutical preparations which contain these compounds.  They are preferably for use in humans.  The compounds according to the invention may be administered by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intranasal route or by inhalation, by<br><br>
transdermal route, if desired with the aid of iontophoresis or enhancers known from the literature, and by oral route.<br>
For parenteral administration, the compounds of formula I or the physiologically acceptable salts thereof, optionally with conventional substances such as solubilisers, emulsifiers or other adjuvants, may be made into solutions, suspensions or emulsions.  Suitable solvents include, for example, water, physiological saline solutions or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanediol or glycerol, sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions or a mixture of various solvents.<br>
In addition, the compounds may be administered by means of implants, e.g. of polylactide, polyglycolide or polyhydroxybutyric acid or by mesins of intranasal preparations.<br>
The oral effectiveness of compounds of general formula I can be demonstrated using the following standard test:<br>
Inhibition of the lowering of blood pressure caused by NK1 in anaesthetised guinea pigs.<br>
Guinea pigs weighing 300-500 grams were anaesthetised with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.), intubated and mechanically ventilated with 10 ml of ambient air per kg of body weight at a rate of 60 breaths per minute.  The blood pressure was measured in the blood flow through the carotid artery.  In order to introduce substances intravenously, the jugular vein was cannulated.<br>
By the intravenous administration of the NK1-agonist<br><br>
[ßAla4, Sar9, Met(O2)11] SP(4-11) (0.2 µmol/kg) a brief lowering of the blood pressure was triggered which was repeated at 10 minute intervals by repeatedly giving the NK1-agonist.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The neurokinin-antagonist was then administered by intraduodenal route and at 10 minute intervals a lowering of blood pressure was induced by means of the NK1-agonist.<br>
The inhibition of the lowering of blood pressure caused by the above-mentioned NK1-agonist was measured before and after treatment with the neurokinin-antagonist.<br>
The compound of Example 5 yielded an ID50 of 1.4 mg/kg. (ID50 is the dose which inhibits the lowering of blood pressure caused by the NK1-agonist by 50%.)<br>
The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by generally known methods.<br><br>
The compounds may be prepared in various ways.  The two commonest methods are shown in the following scheme:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Method A. The carboxylic acid may be linked to the amine HN(R5)R4 in various ways.  The usual methods are coupling methods such as those used in peptide chemistry.  A coupling reagent such as TBTU, DCCI/HOBt, GDI, etc., is added to the coupling partners in an approximately equivalent amount.  Suitable solvents are DMF, THF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, acetonitrile or other inert solvents or mixtures thereof.  The appropriate temperature range is between -50°C and +120°C, preferably between 0°C and 40°C.<br>
The carboxylic acid may also initially be converted by means of SOCI2, SO2Cl2, PCI3, PCI5 or PBrs or mixtures thereof, by known methods, into the corresponding acid halide which is subsequently reacted with the amine HN(R5).R4 in an inert solvent such as CH2Cl2, THF or dioxane at temperatures between -50°C and +100°C, typically between 0°C and 20°C.<br>
Another alternative is to convert the carboxylic acid initially into the alkylester, usually the methylester, by known methods and then to react this ester with the amine HN(R5)R4 in an inert solvent such as DMF, dioxane or THF.  The reaction temperatures are between 20°C and 150°C, typically between 50°C and 120°C.  The reaction may also be carried out in a pressurised container.<br>
Process B. In this, the α-halo-arylacetamide derivative obtained according to known procedures is reacted with the amine R1(R2)NH, thereby generating hydrogen halide. In order to mop up the cleaved (or excess) hydrogen halide, inorganic bases are used such as K2CO3, NaHCO3 or CaCO3, or organic bases may be used such as triethylamine, Hiinig base, pyridine or DMAP, or an excess of the amine R1(R2)NH may be used.  DMF, THF, dioxane or other inert solvents are used.  The temperature range for the reaction is from 0 to lO0°C, typically from 10 to 80°C.<br>
Process C. The compounds according to the invention in which R5 is not H may also be prepared as follows: first of all, the corresponding compound in which R5 is H is synthesised according to process A or B.  Then N-alkylation is carried out as follows in order to introduce alkyl, cycloalkyl or CH2COOH.  The compound according to the invention wherein R5 is H is deprotonated with an equivalent quantity of NaH, NaNH2, KOH, NaOCH3 or<br><br>
some other strong base.  Anhydrous inert solvents such as THF, dioxane or diethylether are used.  Then the corresponding alkylating agent is added slowly in the form of the corresponding halide, tosylate or mesylate. The reaction is carried out in the temperature range from -50°C to +100°C, typically between 0°C and +50°C.  The method is described in detail in Example 33.<br>
Example 1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
1st Step: 2.2 g of 1-cyclohexylpiperazine were dissolved in 150 ml of anhydrous DMF, mixed with 2 g of K2CO3, stirred at room temperature for 2 0 minutes and then cooled to 5°C.  2.7 g of methyl (R, S)-α-bromophenylacetic acid were added and the suspension was stirred overnight at RT.  The precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was evaporated down.  The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate, extracted twice with 10% KHCO3 solution and once with saturated NaCl solution. The organic phase was dried over Na2S04, filtered and evaporated down, and 3.7 g of (R, S) -l-cyclohexyl-4- (methyl 2-phenylacetate)-piperazine were obtained in the form of a yellow oil. Yield: about 100%.<br>
2nd Step: 2.3 g of the product of the first step were dissolved in 10 ml of methanol, mixed with 14 ml of IN NaOH and the resulting emulsion was stirred overnight at room temperature.  The clear reaction solution was<br><br>
neutralised by the addition of 14 ml of 1N HCl, evaporated to dryness, the residue was treated with isopropanol and the solid matter was collected by suction filtration.  The filtrate was evaporated down and the residue was triturated again with isopropanol, the solid matter was suction filtered and combined with the solid obtained earlier.  In this way, 1.6 g of (R,S)-1-cyclohexyl-4-(2-phenylacetic acid)-piperazine were obtained as a white solid. Yield: 75%.<br>
3rd Step: 0.6 g of the product of the second step, 0.48 g of 3 , 5-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-benzylamine and 0.32 g of HOBT were suspended in 60 ml of THF/CH2CI2 (1:1) and adjusted to pH 8.5 by the addition of about 0.7 ml of Hiinig base.  0.77 g of TBTU were added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature.  The clear reaction solution was evaporated down in vacuo, the residue was taken up in CH2Cl2 and extracted twice with 10% KHSO4 solution, once with saturated NaCl solution, twice with 10% KHCO3 solution and once more with saturated NaCl solution.  The organic phase was dried over Na2S04, filtered and evaporated down, whereupon crystallisation took place.  0.685 g of (R,S)-l-cyclohexyl-piperazinyl-4-[2 -phenylacetic acid-N-(3,5-bis-<br>
trif luoromethylbenzyl) amide] were obtained as a yellowish solid.  Yield 64%. Mp: 124 - 129°C.  FAB-MS :  (M+H)+ = 528.2.<br><br>

1st step: 0.49 g of 3,5-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-benzylamine were dissolved in 30 ml of anhydrous CH2Cl2, 0.3 ml of triethylamine were added, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath and over 2 0 minutes a solution of 0.46 g of (R,S)-α-bromophenylacetyl chloride in 10 ml of CH2Cl2 was added dropwise.  After the mixture had stood at room temperature over a weekend, the solvent was eliminated and the solid residue was triturated with diethylether, suction filtered and the filtrate was evaporated down.  0.6 g of α-bromophenylacetic acid N- (bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-amide were obtained as a light beige solid. Yield: 43.5%.<br>
2nd Step: 0.21 g of 4-propionylamino-piperidine hydrochloride were dissolved in 3 0 ml of anhydrous DMF, 0.33 g of K2CO3 were added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Over 20 minutes a solution of 0.68 g of the product of the first step in 10 ml of DMF were added dropwise to this mixture, which was then stirred overnight at room temperature.  The suspension was filtered, the filtrate was evaporated down, the oily residue obtained was taken up in ethyl acetate, extracted twice with 10% KHCO3 solution and once with saturated NaCl solution.  The organic phase was dried over<br><br>
Na2S04, filtered, the filtrate was evaporated down and the semi-solid residue obtained was triturated with diethylether and suction filtered.  0.33 g of (R,S)-4-propionylamino-l- [2-phenylacetic acid-N(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl) -amide] -piperidine were obtained as a white solid.

0.3 g of the compound according to Example 25 were converted into the corresponding base by treatment with KHCO3 and dried.  The resulting product was dissolved in 5 ml of anhydrous THF, 34 mg of NaH (60% in oil) were added and the mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature.  Then 0.1 g of methyliodide were added and the mixture was stirred overnight.  The reaction mixture was mixed with 2 ml of THF/water (1:1) then with 25 ml of water and extracted 3 times with ether.  The combined ether extracts were dried over Na2S04 and evaporated down in vacuo, thereby obtained 170 mg of the desired compound in the form of a free base (oil) .  This was converted into the dihydrochloride by the addition of an excess of ethereal HCl, the dihydrochloride being<br><br>
obtained in the form of yellow crystals. Yield: 113 mg (36%) .<br>
