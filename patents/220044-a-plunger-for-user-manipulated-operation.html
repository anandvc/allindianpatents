BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field Of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a plunger for user-manipulated operation for clearing bstructions from toilets and drain pipes and the like which includes an integrated cover to revent drippage of liquids from the plunger after use.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventional hand-operated plungers include a resiliently deformable cup or head ittached to a handle. During use, the cup is positioned over a clogged drain to form a seal hereabout, and the handle is then depressed causing the cup to collapse and apply pressure to he obstruction in the drain. The cup portion of the plunger has been designed in many different ;onfigurations for various applications and to increase the applied pressure. For example, U.S. patent No. l,193,476(Block) discloses a plunger having a basic cup-shaped design with a inforced rim;U.S.Patent No. 5,974,596 (Strzok) discloses a plunger device having an inner acavity and an outer cavity for applying pressure to the obst-uction; U.S. Patent No. 6,145,135 [Pool, et al.) discloses a plunger having a helical shaped side wall, i.e. a spiral pleat, for imparting a vortex motion to water drawn through and expelled through the nozzle; and U.S. Patent No. 6,192,525 (Tash) discloses a plunger having an end adapted for drains of various sizes and shapes and that also mcludes pleated bellows which compress together during use of the plunger.<br>
A problem with all of the above-mentioned plunger designs is that, as the plunger is removed from the location of its use to a storage location, liquid remaining on the plunger will often drip onto the floors, carpets, or underlying surfaces during transport. One solution is to hold a protective device, i.e., a cloth or catch basin, beneath the plunger during transport. However, this solution requires that a separate part to be held during transport and is messy and inconvenient.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a plunger that ncludes an integral cover that prevents drippage and thereby avoids inadvertent oiling of floors, carpets, and underlying surfaces as the plunger is removed from the ocation of its use to its storage location.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a plunger includes a deformable lead capable of operatively of forcing water through a drain pipe, and a handle connected to the head. In addition, the inventive plunger includes an integral cover movable from a closed position to an open position. In the closed position, the over encloses the head and prevents liquid from dripping from the head onto an underlying surfece. The cover is movable to its open position in which the head is exposed and uncovered to permit the intended drain-clearing use of the head.<br>
In a &amp;st embodiment, the cover comprises a one piece cover element having sections divided by slits. The sections flex outwardly as the cover passes over the head during movement between the closed position and the open position.<br>
In a second embodiment, the cover comprises a plurality of discrete cover sections, each pivoially connected to a shaft that is in turn connected to the head. The handle is movable along a longitudinal as is of the shaft. Each discrete cover section is also connected to the handle via links so that, as the handle moves along the shaft in the direction away from the head, the discrete cover sections pivot toward the open position.<br>
Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the iippended claims. It should be fiirther understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCmPTIOW OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A plunger 10 constructed in accordant^ with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figs. 1-4. The plunger 10 is seen in its closed position in Fig. 1 and in its open position in Fig. 2, and includes a shaft 15 having one end connected to a head 16. The head 16 and shaft 15 are used in a conventional manner to force liquid through a drain pipe to remove obstructions by forcmg them through the pipe under the pressure created by deformation of the head. Thus, the head 16 is positioned to create a seal around the drain to be unclogged, and the shaft 15 is advanced toward the bead 16 to collapse the head and create a surge of pressure in the drain pipe to be unclogged.  Accordingly, the head 16 must be<br><br>
formed of a material, such as rubber, that is flexible and that is self-restoring to its original shape when the advancing force on the shaft 15 is removed or discontinued. The shaft, on the other hand, must be formed of a rigid material such, for example, as metal, wood, fiberglass, or another similarly unyielding material. The head 16 is shown in Figs. 1-4 as having a generally cup-shaped upper part 16a connected to an end portion or member 16b. Nevertheless, the head 16 may comprise any head design suitable for creating a seal around a clogged pipe and forcing water or liquid through the pipe under pressure to remove an obstruction therein, such by way of illustrative example as, but not limited to, the heads disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 1,193,476 (Block), U.S. Patent No. 5,974,596 (Strzok), U.S. Patent No. 6,145,135 (Pool, et al.), orU.S. Patent No. 6,192,525 (Tash).<br>
The plunger 10 also includes a cover 14 and a pull handle 12 connected to cover 14. Pull handle 12 is movable along shaft 15 from a fust position proximate head 16, in which the cover 14 surrounds head 16 (see Fig. 1), to a second position in which cover 14 is displaced to a location remote from head 16 (Fig. 2) so that head 16 is ready for its intended use in clearing a clogged drain. Cover 14 includes a plurality of slits 20 which allow the sections of cover 14 between and defined by slits 20 to flex outward over head 16 as the pull handle 12 is moved from its first position to its second position (see Fig. 4). Accordingly, cover 14 is constructed of a flexible material such as rubber or urethane. Cover 14 may also be molded or otherwise formed to have thinned-out wall sections or grooves 24 to defme living hinges (see Fig. 3) that facilitate flexing of the cover sections 14 between slits 20. The pull handle takes the form of a hollow tube, which may, for example, be molded, and comprises a sufficiently rigid material such as polypropylene or styrene so that pull handle 12 may be manipulated to selectively displace cover 14.<br>
When the plunger 10 is to be used to clear a drain, pull handle 12 is displaced fi-om its first position to its second position so that cover 14 is removed fiom its Fig. I position about head 16. After use of the plunger, pull handle 12 is returned to its first position so that cover 14 is again disposed encirclingly over and about head 16. A base region 22 along the bottom of cover 14 defines a flattened<br><br>
sa or rim capable of supporting plunger 10 in a free-standing position for storage otherwise during periods of non-use.<br>
The base region of cover 14 also forms a lip 18 that, in the first isition of cover 14, is disposed below the lower mosrt extension of head 16. Lip 18 se Fig. 3) defines a trough or groove 19 configured to retain any liquid that drips  head 16 after use of the phmger, as during transport of the plunger from its ace of use to its place of storage. The lip 18 of eah section of cover 14 between ignment slits 20 may also carry an optional extension 18a (Fig. 5) which projects  that cover to a position partly overlapping the next adjacent cover section to 'event liquid from dripping from the slits 20 that separate adjacent cover sections.<br>
Another embodiment of a plunger 110 in accordance with the ivention is shown in Figs. 6-8. In the plunger 110 a head 116 is connected to a laft 142 for use in a substantially conventional manner to operatively force liquid irough a clogged or obstructed drain pipe. The head 116 and shaft-142 may be onstructed in an manner similar to the head 16 and shaft IS of the embodunent of igs. 1-5.<br>
Plunger 110 also includes a cover 114 and an associated handle 112, lover 114 is formed in the illustrated implementation of three separate cover ections 114a, 114b, 114c which are pivotally connected to shaft 142. Although the mbodimcnt shown in the Figs. 6-8 includes three cover sections, the cover 114 may Itematively be formed of two or more than three covsr sections. Each cover section s identical so that the plunger cover is easy to manuJacture. Fig. 6 depicts a closed (osition of cover 114 and Fig. 7 an open position of the cover. Referring to Fig. 8, landle 112 is hollow and fits concentrically over shaft 142. Furthermore, the handle las a radially-inward projection 113 that is movable along and within a helical groove 143 defined in the outer surface of shaft 142. As the handle 112 is selectively rotated relative to shaft 142, the shaft is caused to be telescopically lisplaced into and out of the handle. Each cover section IMa, 114b, 114c is connected via a respective link 124a, 124b, 124c to a ring 130, and the handle 112 is connected to ring 130 so that ring 130 moves with liandle 112 along the lengtii of shaft 142. Shaft 142, however, does not rotate with handle 112 as the handle rotates to drive shaft 142 telescopically into and out of the handle.  One end of each link<br><br>
I24a, 124b, 124c is pivotally connected to ring 130 and the other end is pivotally connected to a corresponding one of the cover sections 114a, 114b, 114c. Thus, as the handle is rotated and is relatively displaced along shaft 142, ring 130 is carried with handle 130 to thereby upwardly shift the links 124a, 124b, 124c and pivot the cover sections 114a, 114, b, 114c to their open position sliown in Fig. 7.<br>
An internal spring 140 is arranged betveen a top of shaft 142 and the blind end of hollow handle 112. The spring 140 is ccmpressed when cover 114 is in its closed position shown in Figs. 6 and 8 and thersby urges shaft 142 outwardly fi-om the handle. In addition, a pushbutton 146 is located on shaft 142 and extends through a bore 147 (see Fig. 8) defined in tiie handle in the fully closed position, thereby retaining cover 114 in its fliUy closed position against the return urgency of spring 140. When pushbutton 146 is manually depressed and thereby released from its engaged extension into bore 147 of handle 112, the handle telescopes outward under the urgency of spring 140 until the cover 114 attains its fiilly open position, and the plunger may then be used in its conventional manner. To prevent shaft 142 from exiting handle 112, a stop 148 may be defined in groove 143 for interaction with projection 113 of the handle. Stop 148 may also take the form of a user-depressable pushbutton tliat engages bore 147 when the cover reaches its fuHy open position.<br>
To close cover 114 after use, handle 112 is twisted relative to ring 130 to draw shaft 142 into handle 112 against the urgency of spring 140 until the cover attains its fiiUy closed position. If stop 148 is implemented as a pushbutton, it must first be depressed in order to commence the twisting movement of handle 112.<br>
In another modification shown in Fig. 9, ring 130 includes a toothing 247 distributed along its interior peripheral circumference. Instead of a pushbutton 146 engaging a bore defined in the handle as in embodiment depicted in Fig. 6-8, a pushbutton 246 is engagable with the ring toothing 247 to prevent unintended rotation of the handle relative to the ring. In this modification, the cover 114 is retainable in its fiilly closed position, its fiilly ope;n position, or in any position therebetween when the pushbutton engages the toothing.<br>
To effect the closing procedure, a user grasps the handle 112 and twists it relative to ring 130 so that shaft 142 telescopes into handle and the cover<br><br>
114 is displaced toward its closed position. Depending on the strength of the user, the flexibility of the user and the position of the usej's initial grip on the handle, it may be necesseiry to momentarily release the user's grip on the handle and realign the grip position to effect fiirther twisting of the handle to attain the fully closed position. The modification of Fig. 9 facilitates this process by allowing the user to temporarily let go of the handle during the closing procedure to realign the user's grip position since interengagement of the pushbutton 246 and toothing 247 prevents return movement of the cover from an intermediate toward the open position should the user let go of the handle before the fully closed posiition is attained. The toothing 247 and pushbutton 246 may alternatively be implemsnted as a ratcheting pawl and toothing permitting unrestricted movement of shaft 142 into the handle but requiring actuation of pushbutton 246 to advance the shaft outwardly from the handle. This Fig. 9 modification thus allows the user to readily close the cover 114 without actuating pushbutton 246.<br>
In still another modification of the plunger of Figs. 6-8 the cover sections 114a, 114b and 114c may be pivotably or hingably connected to a central cover section fixedly mounted on the shaft 142. In this manner the entire cover 114 may be constructed as an integrated unit prior to mounting to the remainder of the plunger. As seen in Fig. 10, a center cover section 114d is fixedly mounted on shaft 142. Cover sections 114a, 114b, and 114c are hinged to center cover section 114d so that they are pivotable from a closed to an open position and may be configured in any suitable manner to minimize drippage from the plunger in the closed position of the cover. As should be apparent, the cover sections 114a, 114b, 114c an instead be pivotably coimected to the center cover section 114d using a pivot pin as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
As in the ranbodiment of Figs. 1-5, the cover 114 in the various embodiments of Figs. 6-10 may optionally be shaped to define an overiaying lip 18 that lies below head 116 and which forms a groove or trough 19 to retain any liquid that drips from the head during transport of the plunger from the site of use to &amp;e location of storage.<br>
The cover 114 of Figs. 6-10 need not be flexible and accordingly may be constructed of a hard plastic such as polypropyksne or styrene or other rigid<br><br>
material. Handle 112 and links 124a, 124b, 124c may likewise be formed of a hard plastic or the like. The pivotal connections may be effected using, for example, metal or plastic pins. Furthermore, the projection 113 of handle 112 may be manufactured of a metal, hard plastic, or other suitably strong material. Shaft 142 may comprise a central portion 142a and an outer porlion 142b, as shown in Fig. 8. The central portion 142a may be implemented in the maimer of a conventional plunger shaft, as of wood or plastic, and the outer portion I42b may be formed of a hard plastic or other suitably strong material. The dripless functionality of the present invention may accordingly be readily added to or incorporated in an otherwise conventional plunger.<br>
Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fiindamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices- illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements shown and/or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.<br><br><br>
