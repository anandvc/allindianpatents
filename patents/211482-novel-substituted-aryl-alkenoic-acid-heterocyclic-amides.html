				<td>The present invention relates to novel substituted aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides. The invention particularly relates to the novel substituted aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides of formula I shown in the drawings accompanying the specification where n= 1 or 2, x= O or N-CH3 and Ar represents:- 4-substituted phenyl moiety where R= C 1.5 alkyl group, Ar also represents heterobicyclic 3,4- disubstituted phenyl group such as 3', 4'- dihydro-2', 2'-dimethyl benzopyran-61-yl, 3',4'- methylenedioxy or 3',4' - ethylenedioxyphenyl. The present invention also relates to the process of the preparation of novel substituted aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides of formula 1 where n=l or 2, x=O or N-CH3 and Ar as stated above..<br>
The compounds of this invention are all novel and possess specific hot, pungent and spicy taste when subjected to direct pungency evaluation. The compounds of the present invention does not give any nuturitional value. These compounds may be useful as food additives and anti-oxidants. The synthesised compounds can possess useful pharmacological properties which is expected to find application in new test models for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, bioavailability enhancers and for the study of hepatic drug metabolising mechanism.<br>
Aroma, flavour and taste are considered to be the three important parameters for determining the quality of spices or condiments. The aroma and flavour of a spice depends upon the presence of volatile components , which are perceived through the olfactory epithelium present in the nose. The olfactory substances are primarily mono-, sesqui- or diterpenes, low molecular weight hydrocarbons, heteroacyclic or heterocyclic compounds. The taste is perceived by the taste buds present on the surface of the tongue. The interactions between the pungent molecules and receptors present on the surface of the tongue are the main cause of generation of hot sensation or thermogenecity which is associated with pungency. More pungent the substance, more is the duration of the feeling of hotness. This feeling of hotness may also be perceived on other tender parts of the skin. Most of the<br><br>
known natural pungent substances are aromatic in nature. Some of the most commonly known natural pungent substances include piperamides such as pipeline from black pepper (Piper nigrum), capsaicinoids such as capsaicin and dihydro-capsaicin from red chillies (Capsicum annum) and gingeroids like gingerol from ginger ( Zingiber officianalis) etc. The chemistry and properties of pungent compounds from natural sources has recently been reviewed ( Nakatani, Nobugi; Koryo, 1995, 185. p 59-64, Chem. Abs. 123, 5520 n).<br>
These pungent principles which possess anti-oxidant properties are also associated with many physiological actions viz piperamides, capsaicinoids as well as gingeroids are reported to possess anti- inflammatory properties (Lewis,D. A. in And- inflammatory drugs from plant and marine sources; Birkhauser Verlag, Berlin, 1989, p 216-220; Janusz, J.M., J. Med. Chem. 1993,36, p 2595). Both pipeline and dihydrocapsaicin were found to interact irreversibly with hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes thereby inhibiting their activity as indicated by prolongation of pentobarbital sleeping time in rats (SushYoung- Joon, A, et al., Life sciences, 1995, 56(16), p 305-31 1; Atal, C. K. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therp. 1985, 232. p 258-262).<br>
Only few reports have appeared in the literature related to the evaluation of structure with respect to pungency. Direct subjective method of analysis of capsaicin and related extracts for their pungency evaluation was developed by Wilbur Scoville in 1912. In this method potency of pepper was measured as heat units by diluting the extracts until pungency was just detected after placing a drop on the tongue. Pure capsaicin was thus assigned 107 units and jalapeno 103 units ( Scoville, W. J. , Am. Pharm. Assoc, 1912, i, p 453-454). Indirect evaluation of pungency through the measurement of physiological effects have also been employed. For example Watnabe et al. reported the assessment of pungency related thermogenecity to structure of capsaicin analogues by correlating it with adrenal catecholamine secretion in rats ( Watnabe, Tatsno et al. Life. Sci. , 1994, 54(5), p 369-<br><br>
374; Chem. Abs. , 120: 94792f). Astringent and pungent substances were studied using a multichannel taste sensor by observing the changes in electric potential in lipid membranes. However pungent substances were found to have no effect on the membrane potentials (liyama, Satoru et al., Chem. Senses, 1994, 19(1), p 87-96; Chem. Abs. 120: 295156).<br>
Known natural or synthetic pungent substances are invariably oxygenated aromatic compounds with an alkyl side chain and a hetero atom comprising preferably an amide linkage in the side chain. Some of these compounds were found to possess hot pungent characteristics on preliminary evaluation. On the basis of above observation several new series of aryl alkenoic acid amides were synthesised and their structure and pungency relationship has also been established. Another important aspect of the development of these compounds is the possibility of their utilisation as new test models for the study and management of the phenomenon of pain and inflammation. These observations are based on the recent work carried out by the David Julius et al. who have identified the capsaicin receptor by isolating the complimentary DNA encoding the binding protein (Julius, D. et al. Nature, 1997, 389, p 816-824 ). Isolation and identification of the receptor protein is an important development for the study of new pharmacological targets which will help in understanding the phenomenon of chronic pain caused by arthritis, spinal cord injury or diabetic neuropathy. It is expected that vanilloid receptor and the receptor for the synthesised compounds of formula 1 may turn out to be the same. Therefore, the development of these novel compounds may provide a diverse and effective alternate to capsaicin and related vanilloids.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide the novel substituted aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides. Another object of the present invention is to provide novel synthetic compounds useful as thermogenic, pungent and spicy agents. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds which can find application as new test models for the development of anti-<br><br>
inflammatory drugs, bioavailability enhancers and for the study of hepatic drug metabolising mechanism.<br>
The novel aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides of formula 1 shown in the drawing accompanying the specification may be useful as hot, pungent and spicy agents, and also as food additives, anti-oxidants, bioavailability enhancers and for the study of hepatic drug metabolising mechanism including UDP- glucose dehydrogenase and glucuronidation activities.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides novel aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amide of formula 1, where n=l or 2, x=O or N-CH3 and Ar represents:- 4-substituted phenyl moiety where R= C 1.5 alkyl group, Ar also represents heterobicyclic 3,4-disubstituted phenyl group such as 3',4'- dihydro-2',2' dimethyl benzopyran-6'-yl, 3',4'- methylenedioxy or 3',4'-ethylenedioxyphenyl. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amides of formula 1 where n is 1 or 2, x=O or N-CH3 and Ar represents as stated above in claim 1 which comprises reacting aldehyde of formula 5 with methyl magnesium halide preferably methyl magnesium iodide with constant stirring at ambient temperature in an anhydrous ether solvent to produce corresponding phenyl ethanol of formula 4, the compound of formula 4 is treated with dimethyl formamide and phosphorus oxychloride mixture at 0-10°C for 20-40 hours, to produce substituted phenyl-2E-propenaldehyde of formula 3, wherein—n is4 and Ar as stated above which on reaction with Wittig reagent prepared by triphenyl phosphine and bromoethyl acetate in presence of a base at temperature in the range of 15-80°C for a period in the range of 1-80 hrs., isolating the corresponding ester by conventional method followed by base hydrolysis to acid of formula 2 wherein n is 2, converting acid of formula 2 where n is lor 2 to corresponding acid chloride using thionyl chloride and reacting the acid chloride with heterocyclic amine in an inert<br><br>
organic solvent at temperature in the range of 0-50°C , isolating the compound of formula 1 by conventional method, wherein n is lor 2 and Ar represents as stated above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amide of formula 1 where n=2, x=O or N-CH3 and Ar represents as stated above i.e. substituted phenyl 2E, 4E-pentadienoic acid heterocyclic amide of the formula I are synthesised from the corresponding aromatic aldehyde of formula 5. The substituted aromatic aldehyde of formula 5 is first reacted with methyl magnesium halide preferably methyl magnesium iodide with constant stirring at ambient temperature in an anhydrous ether solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like to produce corresponding phenyl ethanol of formula 4. The compound of formula 4 is treated with dimethyl formamide and phosphorus oxychloride mixture at 0-10°C for 20-40 hrs, contents neutralised with dilute alkali solution to produce substituted phenyl-2E-propenaldehyde of formula 3_. The aldehyde of formula 3 is thereafter condensed with a ylide prepared from triphenyl phosphine and ethyl bromoacetate equimolar mixture in presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide and the like at temperature 15-80°C for 1 to 24 hrs in an ethereal medium such as diethyl ether, dimethoxy ethane and the like to yield corresponding ethyl substituted phenyl- 2E,4E-pentadienoate which is hydrolysed without purification with a strong alkali solution using sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like followed by acidification to furnish substituted phenyl-2E.4E -pentadienoic acid of formula 2. The solution of aryl alkenoic acid of formula 2 where n=2 and Ar as stated above in an inert organic solvent such as benzene, dichloromethane is treated with thionyl chloride and solvent removed. The acyl chloride intermediate thus obtained is condensed with heterocyclic amine in inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, benzene, diethylether, and the like in the temp, range of 0 to 50°C, after the purification by crystallisation or column chromatography to produce aryl alkenoic acid heterocyclic amide of formula 1.<br><br>
Substituted aryl 2E-propenoic acid of formula 2 (n=l) which is known in the art of synthesis (Miroslav, K. etal: collect.Czech Chem. Commun., 1981, 46 (5), p 1173 - 87; Theopil, E. et al, Synthesis, 1996, 6, p 755 - 62) is converted to acyl chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane, benzene, diethylether and the like, followed by condensation with heterocyclic amine in an inert solvent, purification by column chromatography or crystallisation to yield substituted aryl -2E-propenoic acid heterocyclic amide of formula 1 where (n=l) and Ar as stated above.<br>
The compounds of above invention were assessed in terms of the heat units for ascertaining their potency, by a panel of five untrained volunteers through a subjective or direct analysis using modified W. Scoville method. A stock solution of the compound (1%) in alcohol: water (1:1) was diluted until the sensation of pungency/ hotness just detected by placing 5uJ of the solution on the tip of the tongue of the volunteers. In all the cases the pungency measurement was made in the reverse order i.e. from less dilute to more dilute solutions till pungency detection was just possible. Mouth and tongue were thoroughly washed with water after each evaluation, sufficient time gap was given before the next evaluation was initiated. In most of the compounds a clear solution was obtained in stock solutions. In some cases where solubility was poor, a uniform suspension was prepared through magnetic stirring or sonication. Although individual perception of pungency varied from person to person, on an average fair consistency was achieved.<br>
