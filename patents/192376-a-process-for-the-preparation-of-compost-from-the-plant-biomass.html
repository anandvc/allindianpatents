				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of compost from the plant biomass.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Plant biomass such as saw dust, peeled out bark, leaves and seed coats from seed collection centers is used either as low calorific value fuel or left in the fields or in the pits for their natural decay to compost in a period of about 1-2 hours.<br>
Eucalyptus (Family:Myrtaceae) is a large genus of evergreen aromatic trees. Eucalyptus hybrid popularly known as Mysore gum has been the most widely used species for raising plantation in denuded and barren areas. The leaves yield essential oil and wood is used for pulp and paper. The left out saw dust from paper and saw mills is hitherto a waste material.<br>
The plant tissue obtained from the different parts of a plant is the source of soil organic matter for the soil. It consists of sugars and starches, hemicellulose, cellulose, fats, waxes, tannins, lignins, and proteins. The organic matter in the plant tissue under go oxidation which leads to liberation of carbon dioxide, energy followed by humus formation. In an earlier method used for composting the plant tissue was mixed with nitrogen carrier such as urea and humus bacteria which leads to composting in a period of about 2 years. In an another method pine bark was converted to compost by treatment with dil Nitric acid at 100 degree centigrade and neutarlisation followed by composting with microbes. In yet another method ground bark saturated with water was treated with urea, ammonium hydroxide, Potassium sulphate, and ammonium hydrogen phosphate. The time of composting may vary from 45 days to 2 years.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass such as saw dust and bark of Eucalyptus hybrid, needles and saw dust of Pinus roxburghii, bark of Populus deltoids and mixed seed coats.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass such as saw dust and bark of Eucalyptus hybrid, needles and saw dust of Pinus roxburghii, bark of Populus deltoides and mixed seed coats which is easy, simple very short and cheap.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass such as saw dust and bark of Eucalyptus hybrid, needles and saw dust of Pinus roxburghii, bark of Populus deltoids and mixed seed coats and wherein the nitrogen content of the saw dust compost is comparable farm yard manure which requires very long time for its preparation as compared to the method of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass preferably saw dust of Eucalyptus hybrid which comprises the step of roasting by heating at a temperature of 165- 205°C a mixture of 1kg saw dust in 1 to 10 ml of orthophosphoric acid and in 1 to 10 litre of water for 15 to 120 minutes followed by treating the roasted mixture with 15 to 90ml ammonia and 1 to 20 gms of potassium sulphate dissolve in water per kg of saw dust, mixing the mixture and leaving at room temperature for 5-10<br>
In accordance with the process of this invention, the air dried plant biomass such as saw dust of Eucal yptus hybrid is subjected to a step of roasting by heating the material after treatment with aqueous orthophosphoric acid till it changes its original colour. The roasting step comprises in neating a mixture of material with ortnnphovsphoric. acid and such that i to 10 ml of said said is employed for every kilogram of the saw dust in 1 to 3.0 litres of water. Such a mixture is heated tor 15 to 120 minutes with constant stirring till the original colour is completely lost. If a longer time is employed for the<br><br>
heating     step    it	nay   lead   to   complete   burning     ot      the<br>
material      to  ash.      The   second   step   involves   the     removal<br>
of      the  roasted   material   from   the  roasting   pan     and     its<br>
treatment   with   15   to   90   m3.   o-f   ammonia   solution   and   i      to<br>
20     grams   of     potassium   sulphate  per     kilogram     of     the<br>
b i omase   arid   in   water   equal   to the   weight   ot   the   biomass.<br>
The     mixture     is     thoroughly     mixed     at:      left      at        room<br>
temperratrre   t or   5	10   d ays,<br>
Further objects     and invention     will      be     more     apparent.      from    the       ensuing<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Air dried saw dust of Eucalyptus hybrid is subjected to a step of roasting till it changes its original colour. The roasting step is carried by heating at temperature range of 165-205°C a mixture of 10 kg of saw dust with 1 to 10 ml of orthophosphoric acid (88-93%) per kilogram of saw dust in 1 to 10 litres of water for 15 to 120 minutes with constant stirring it completely lost its original colour. The second step involves the removal of the roasted material from the roasting pan and its treatment with 15 to 90 ml of 25% ammonia solution (specific gravity 0.91) and 1 to 20 gms potassium sulphate taken per kilogram of the saw dust and in water equal to the weight of the saw dust. The mixture was thoroughly mixed and left at room temperature for 5-10 days. The yield of the compost obtained was found to be -165% of the starting material. The yield of the compost is higher because it contains water, equal to the weight of the starting material, which was used in dissolving ammonia solution and potassium sulphate. Pinus roxburghii saw dust was converted to compost by using the similar conditions in the yield of -162%. If the water holding capacity of the starting biomass is less<br>
then amount. of water can be suitably ison to their saw dust, are given in table 1. reduced. The properties of both the composts in compar<br>
Table  is  The properties of compost in  comparison  to the saw dust.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
percentage of nitrogen (0.83%) was  found to  be  in The the same range  as in farm yard  manure  0.4-<br>
1.5%;. The nitrogen content, in the composts can be increased and C/N ratio decreased by treating them with additional amount of ammonia solution.<br>
By  using  the  similar  procedure	we   also<br>
converted the Eucalyptus hybrid bark, Populus	deltoides<br>
bark, Pinus roxburghii needles and a mixture of seed coatst to compost.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1. A process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass preferably saw dust of Eucalyptus hybrid which comprises the step of roasting by heating at a temperature of 165- 205°C a mixture of 1kg saw dust in 1 to 10 ml of orthophosphoric acid and in 1 to 10 litre of water for 15 to 120 minutes followed by treating the roasted mixture with 15 to 90ml ammonia and 1 to 20 gms of potassium sulphate dissolve in water per kg of saw dust, mixing the mixture and leaving at room temperature for 5-10 days.<br>
2.       A process for the preparation of compost from plant biomass substantially as herein described and exemplified in the example.<br><br></td>
