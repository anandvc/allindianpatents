METHOD AND SYSTEM TO PREVENT FALSE<br>
SPEED DISPLAY DURING HIGH ENGINE SPEED OPERATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/847,224, filed on September 26, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to vehicles driven by an internal<br>
combustion engine, and more particularly to a vehicle speed detection control to<br>
prevent false speed display during high engine speed operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Vehicles include a power plant, such as an internal combustion<br>
engine, that generates drive torque. The drive torque is transferred from the<br>
engine and through a transmission to drive wheels and to propel the vehicle<br>
along a surface. A vehicle speed is monitored, is displayed to the vehicle<br>
operator and is used by a control system to regulate vehicle and/or power plant<br>
operation.<br>
[0004] Some vehicles include a transmission output shaft speed<br>
(TOSS) sensor that monitors a rotational speed of the transmission output shaft.<br>
The vehicle speed is determined based on the TOSS. The TOSS sensor is<br>
responsive to a toothed wheel that is fixed for rotation with the transmission<br>
1<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
output shaft. More specifically, the TOSS sensor is responsive to the rising and<br>
falling edges of the teeth of the toothed wheel, and generates a signal indicating<br>
the rate at which the teeth pass the TOSS sensor.<br>
[0005] In some vehicles, the transmission output shaft vibrates while<br>
the vehicle is stopped or is traveling slowly and the power plant (e.g., the engine)<br>
is revved. For example, if the transmission is in a neutral state and the power<br>
plant is revved, vibration of the transmission output shaft can result. In some<br>
cases, a rising or falling edge of a tooth can be positioned just under the TOSS<br>
sensor. If the transmission output shaft sufficiently vibrates, a false or otherwise<br>
inaccurate TOSS sensor signal can result.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention provides a vehicle speed<br>
detection control system. The vehicle speed detection system includes a first<br>
module that checks a plurality of vehicle operating conditions and a second<br>
module that checks a plurality of vehicle set-up conditions. A third module<br>
generates a control signal based on output signals provided by the first and<br>
second modules. The control signal indicates that a vehicle speed is to be<br>
determined based on an anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensor signal if each of<br>
the plurality of vehicle operating conditions and each of the plurality of vehicle<br>
set-up conditions is met.<br>
[0007] In other features, the vehicle speed detection control system<br>
further includes a fourth module that generates a vehicle operating condition<br>
2<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
signal that is based on a difference signal and a threshold value. The vehicle<br>
operating condition signal is output to the first module. A fifth module determines<br>
the difference signal based on a transmission output shaft speed sensor signal<br>
and the ABS sensor signal.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the vehicle speed detection control system<br>
further includes a fourth module that generates a vehicle operating condition<br>
signal that is based on the ABS sensor signal and a threshold value. The vehicle<br>
operating condition signal is output to the first module.<br>
[0009] In another feature, the vehicle speed detection control system<br>
further includes a fourth module that generates a vehicle operating condition<br>
signal that is based on an engine speed sensor signal and a threshold value.<br>
The vehicle operating condition signal is output to the first module.<br>
[0010] In still other features, the vehicle speed detection control system<br>
further includes first and second vehicle set-up flags that are input into the<br>
second module. The first vehicle set-up flag includes a manual transmission flag<br>
and the second vehicle set-up flag includes an ABS flag.<br>
[0011] In yet anther feature, the control signal indicates that a vehicle<br>
speed is to be determined based on transmission output shaft speed sensor<br>
signal if any one of the plurality of vehicle operating conditions or the plurality of<br>
vehicle set-up conditions is not met.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
3<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] The present invention will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0014] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary vehicle<br>
that implements a vehicle speed detection control in accordance with the present<br>
invention,<br>
[0015] Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary steps executed by<br>
the vehicle speed detection control of the present invention; and<br>
[0016] Figure 3 is a functional block diagram illustrating exemplary<br>
modules that execute the vehicle speed detection control of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
4<br><br>
General Motors No GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle system 10 is<br>
illustrated. The vehicle system 10 includes an engine 12 that drives a<br>
transmission 14 through a coupling device 16. In the case of the transmission 14<br>
being an automatic transmission (ATX), the coupling device 16 is a torque<br>
converter. In the case of the transmission 14 being a manual transmission<br>
(MTX), the coupling device 16 is a clutch.<br>
[0019] The engine 12 generates drive torque by combusting an air and<br>
fuel mixture within cylinders (not shown). More specifically, air is drawn into an<br>
intake manifold 18 through a throttle 20. The air is mixed with fuel and the<br>
air/fuel mixture is combusted within the cylinders to rotatably drive a crankshaft<br>
(not shown), which in turn drives the transmission 14 through the coupling device<br>
16. Combustion gas is exhausted from the engine through an exhaust manifold<br>
22. The transmission 14 multiplies the drive torque by a selected gear ratio and<br>
transfers the drive torque via a transmission output shaft 24 to propel the vehicle<br>
system 10 along a surface. More specifically, the vehicle system 10 is supported<br>
by at least one wheel 26. Although a single wheel 26 is illustrated, it is<br>
anticipated that the vehicle system 10 can include a plurality of wheels 26, and<br>
preferably includes four wheels 26.<br>
[0020] A control module 28 regulates operation of the vehicle system<br>
10. More specifically, the control module 28 receives engine operation data from<br>
various sensors, some of which are described in detail below, and regulates the<br>
5<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
engine 12 based on the sensor signals. An engine speed sensor 30 generates a<br>
signal based on a rotational speed of the engine 12 (RPMENG) A transmission<br>
output shaft speed (TOSS) sensor 32 generates a signal based on a rotational<br>
speed of the transmission output shaft (RPMTOSS). An anti-lock braking system<br>
(ABS) includes an ABS sensor 34 that generates a signal based on a rotational<br>
speed of the wheel 26 (RPMABS)- Although a single ABS sensor 34 is illustrated,<br>
it is appreciated that multiple ABS sensors can be implemented. Preferably, the<br>
is one ABS sensor 34 for each wheel 26.<br>
[0021] The vehicle speed detection control of the present invention<br>
determines whether a vehicle speed or velocity (VVEH) is to be determined as a<br>
function of RPMABS or a function of RPMTOSS. More specifically, the vehicle<br>
speed detection control checks a plurality of initial or vehicle set-up conditions<br>
including, but not limited to whether the vehicle system 10 includes ABS and<br>
whether the transmission 14 is an MTX (e.g., whether a transmission flag<br>
(FLAGMTX) is set equal to 1). If either the vehicle system 10 does not include<br>
ABS or the transmission 14 is not an MTX, VVEH is determined based on<br>
RPMTOSS.<br>
[0022] If the vehicle system 10 includes ABS and the transmission 14<br>
is an MTX, the vehicle speed detection control checks a plurality of vehicle<br>
operating conditions. For example, the vehicle speed detection control<br>
determines whether the difference of RPMTOSS and RPMABS is greater than or<br>
equal to a first threshold (k1) (i.e., are RPMTOSS and RPMABS within a sufficient<br>
range of one another), whether RPMABS is less than or equal to a second<br>
6<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
threshold (k2) (i.e., is the vehicle system 10 moving less than a threshold speed)<br>
and whether RPMENG is greater than or equal to a third threshold (k3) (i.e., is the<br>
engine 12 revving above a threshold RPM).<br>
[0023] If the difference of RPMTOSS and RPMABS is not greater than or<br>
equal to k1, or RPMABS is not less than or equal to k2, or RPMENG is not greater<br>
than or equal to k3, the TOSS sensor signal is deemed rational for the particular<br>
operating conditions and VVEH is determined based on RPMToss. If the difference<br>
of RPMTOSS and RPMABS is greater than or equal to k1, RPMABS is less than or<br>
equal to k2, and RPMENG is greater than or equal to k3, the TOSS sensor signal is<br>
deemed irrational for the particular operating conditions and VVEH is determined<br>
based on RPMABS.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
vehicle speed detection control will be described in detail. In step 200, control<br>
determines whether an ABS system is present. For example, FLAGABS, which is<br>
stored in memory, is equal to 1 if an ABS system is present and is equal to 0 if an<br>
ABS system is no present. If an ABS system is not present, control continues in<br>
step 202. If an ABS system is present, control continues in step 204.<br>
[0025] In step 204, control determines whether the transmission is a<br>
manual transmission. For example, FLAGMTX, which is stored in memory, is<br>
equal to 1 if the transmission is a manual transmission and is equal to 0 if the<br>
transmission is not a manual transmission. If the transmission is not a manual<br>
transmission, control continues in step 202. If the transmission is a manual<br>
transmission, control continues in step 206.<br>
7<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No 8540P-000383<br>
[0026] In step 206, control determines whether the difference between<br>
RPMTOSS and RPMABS is greater than or equal to k1. If the difference between<br>
RPMTOSS and RPMABS is not greater than or equal to k1, control continues in step<br>
202. If the difference between RPMTOSS and RPMABS is greater than or equal to<br>
k1, control continues in step 208. In step 208, control determines whether<br>
RPMABS is less than or equal to k2. If RPMABS is not less than or equal to k2,<br>
control continues in step 202. If RPMABS is less than or equal to k2, control<br>
continues in step 210.<br>
[0027] In step 210, control determines whether RPMENG is greater than<br>
or equal to k3. If RPMENG is not greater than or equal to k3, control continues in<br>
step 202. If RPMENG is greater than or equal to k3, control continues in step 212.<br>
In step 202, control determines VVEH based on RPMTOSS and control ends. In<br>
step 204, control determines VVEH based on RPMABS and control ends.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
vehicle speed detection control will be described in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules includes a summer 300, first, second and third comparator modules<br>
302, 304 and 306, respectively, and first, second and third AND gate modules<br>
308, 310 and 312, respectively. The summer 300 determines the difference<br>
between RPMTOSS and RPMABS and outputs the difference to the first comparator<br>
module 302. The first comparator module 302 determines whether the difference<br>
is greater than or equal to k1. If the difference is greater than or equal to k1, the<br>
first comparator module 302 outputs a signal value of 1 to the first AND gate<br>
module 308. If the difference is not greater than or equal to k1, the first<br>
8<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
comparator module 302 outputs a signal value of 0 to the first AND gate module<br>
308.<br>
[0029] The second comparator module 304 determines whether<br>
RPMABS is less than or equal to k2. If RPMABS is less than or equal to k2, the<br>
second comparator module 304 outputs a signal value of 1 to the first AND gate<br>
module 308. If RPMABS is not less than or equal to k2, the second comparator<br>
module 304 outputs a signal value of 0 to the first AND gate module 308. The<br>
third comparator module 306 determines whether RPMENG is greater than or<br>
equal to k3. If RPMENG is greater than or equal to k3, the third comparator module<br>
306 outputs a signal value of 1 to the first AND gate module 308. If RPMENG is<br>
not greater than or equal to k3, the third comparator module 306 outputs a signal<br>
value of 0 to the first AND gate module 308.<br>
[0030] The first AND gate module 308 receives the signal values from<br>
the first, second and third comparator modules 302, 304 and 302, respectively.<br>
The first AND gate module 308 generates an output signal based on the<br>
operating conditions of the vehicle system 10, which is provided to the third AND<br>
gate module 312. More specifically, if each of the above-described vehicle<br>
operating conditions is met, the first AND gate module 308 outputs a signal value<br>
of 1. If any of the above-described vehicle operating conditions is not met, the<br>
first AND gate module 308 outputs a signal value of 0.<br>
[0031] The second AND gate module receives the FLAGMTX signal<br>
value and the FLAGABS signal value from memory and generates an output signal<br>
based on the vehicle set-up conditions, which is provided to the third AND gate<br>
9<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-307728<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000383<br>
module 312. If both the FLAGMTX signal value and the FLAGABS signal value are<br>
equal to 1, the second AND gate module 310 generates an output signal equal to<br>
1. If either the FLAGMTX signal value or the FLAGABS signal value is equal to 0,<br>
the second AND gate module 310 generates an output signal equal to 0.<br>
[0032] The third AND gate module 312 generates a control signal<br>
based on the signals provided by the first and second AND gate modules 308,<br>
310. If both input signals are equal to 1, the control signal is set equal to 1. If<br>
either input signal is equal to 0, the control signal is set equal to 0. A control<br>
signal that is equal to 1 indicates that VVEH is to be determined based on RPMABS<br>
and a control signal that is equal to 0 indicates that VVEH is to be determined<br>
based on RPMToss. A VVEH calculating module (not shown) calculates and<br>
displays VVEH accordingly.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>

A vehicle speed detection system includes a first module that checks a<br>
plurality of vehicle operating conditions and a second module that checks a<br>
plurality of vehicle set-up conditions. A third module generates a control signal<br>
based on output signals provided by the first and second modules. The control<br>
signal indicates that a vehicle speed is to be determined based on an anti-lock<br>
braking system (ABS) sensor signal if each of the plurality of vehicle operating<br>
conditions and each of the plurality of vehicle set-up conditions is met.<br></td>
