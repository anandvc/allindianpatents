Emanator Device<br>
This invention relates to an emanator device for emitting an active agent into an atmosphere, particularly, but not limited to an emanator device for emitting a fragrance or the like into the atmosphere.<br>
It is known to provide an electrical air freshener emanator which plugs into an electrical socket. The emanator is powered by the electrical socket and incorporates a heater which causes evaporation of a air freshening liquid retained within a bottle portion of the emanator. Evaporation of a liquid by the heating element, together with the use of a fan allows the emanator to emit the freshener into the atmosphere.<br>
Problems arise with type of device in that it may be possible to replace a bottle portion of the emanator with a bottle containing a material or fragrance that "is unsuitable for use with remainder of the emanator device. Damage could result from use of an inappropriate fluid with the remainder of the emanator device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to address the above-mentioned disadvantage.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, an emanator device for emitting an active agent into the air comprises a container for the active agent, which container is adapted to supply the active agent to a dispersing section, which dispersing section is adapted to accelerate emission of the active agent, wherein the container and the dispersing section incorporate co-<br><br>
operating engagement means adapted to allow the container and the dispersing section to be secured to each other, the engagement means including container security means and dispersing section security means adapted to cooperate with each other, wherein the presence of both the container security means and the dispersing section security means are required to effect engagement of the container and the dispersing section.<br>
Preferably the co-operating engagement means are adapted to allow selective disengagement of the container and the dispersing section.<br>
Engagement may be sufficient engagement to allow the active agent to be supplied from the container to the dispersing section.<br>

The at least one projection may project downwardly into the opening, preferably towards a mouth of the opening. Preferably, the at least one projection is adjacent to an aperture, preferably an active agent aperture, in the dispersing section. The active agent aperture preferably forms a channel through which the active agent is supplied to the dispersing section. Preferably a plurality of projections is provided, preferably three projections, which projections preferably surround the aperture.<br>
The container security means preferably comprise at least one recess shaped to receive the at least one projection of the dispersing section security means.<br>
The at least one recess may be located on an outer surface of the container, preferably on a neck section thereof. Preferably the at least one recess extends longitudinally along the container. The at least one recess may extend only part way along the container. The at least one recess may form a gap in a thread or ridge formed on the container, said thread or ridge may form part of the engagement means.<br><br>
The at least one recess may be a recess in an end of the container, preferably in a mouth of the container, Preferably, the recess is annular, which annulus may be bounded by a wall of the container and an active agent transmission section, preferably a wick. The annulus is preferably adapted to receive an, optionally at least partially, annular projection or plurality of projections forming an at least partial annulus.<br>

All of the features described herein may be combined with any of the above aspects, in any combination.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how embodiments of the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is partial schematic perspective view of a bottle section and a dispersing section of a first embodiment of emanator device;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic side view of the bottle section shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view from above of the bottle section;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view from below of the dispersing section;<br><br>
Figure 5 is a schematic perspective view of a second embodiment. of emanator device comprising a bottle section and dispersing section;<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic view from below of the dispersing section shown in Figure 5;<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic view from above of the bottle section shown in Figure 5;<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic perspective view from above of the bottle section shown in Figure 5;<br>
Figure 9 is a schematic cross-sectional view of the second embodiment of emanator device; and<br>
Figure 10 is a schematic side view of a generalised prior art emanator device.<br>
Figure 10 shows a prior art emanator device consisting of a bottle section 10 containing an air freshener and a dispersing section 20 to disperse the air freshener by heating and blowing the evaporated air freshener* into the air with a fan.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show a first embodiment of emanator device and in particular means by which a bottle section of the emanator device may engage a dispersing section of the emanator device.<br>
In Figure 1 a bottle 10 has a neck 12 with a thread 14 formed on an outer surface of the neck. The thread 14 incorporates two flats 15a/16b on opposed sides of the<br><br>
neck. The flats I6a/16b form gaps in the thread 14, which flats 16a/16b run lengthways along the neck 12. The bottle 10 also incorporates a wick 18 which transfers fluid from the bottle 10 to a dispersing section 20, shown partially in Figure 1, but which may generally have the form shown in Figure 10.<br>
The dispersing section 20 incorporates an opening 22 in which the neck 12 6f the bottle 10 is received. An interior wall of the opening 22 incorporates projections 24a and 24b which have a width the same as or slightly less than the width of the flats 16a/16b on the neck 12. The projections 24a/24b are located at opposed sides of a lower edge of the opening 22. Above the projections 24a/24b on the inner wall there is a thread (not shown for the sake of clarity) - The thread corresponds to the thread 14 on the neck 12.<br>
In use, the bottle 10 is engaged with the dispersing section 20 so that the wick 18 protrudes into an opening 26 in the dispersing section 20.<br>
Engagement of the bottle 10 and the dispersing section 20 is achieved as follows. First, the projections 24a/24b are aligned with the flats 16a/16b. The dispersing section 20 and the bottle 10 are then moved towards one another so that the projections 24a/24b move down the flats I6a/16b until the thread in the opening 22 of the dispersing section 20 bears against the top part of the thread 14 on the neck 12. When the threads are touching one another relative rotation of the dispersing section 10 and the bottle 10 can be carried out in the normal way to screw the two parts together-  The projections 24a/24b<br><br>
engage with the thread in the opening 22 in the usual way and effectively form a leading part of the thread in the opening 22.<br>
The presence of the projections 24a/24b in the dispersing section requires the presence of the flats 16a/16b in locations corresponding to the location of the projections 24a/24b. Thus, where no flats are present on a bottle the bottle cannot be engaged with a dispersing section.<br>
In Figure 2 the lowest part of the thread 14 is shown in the form of a ring 30 incorporating the flats 16a/16b discussed above. The dispersing section 20 is pushed onto the neck 12 after alignment of the flats 16a/16b with the projections 24a/24b. During twisting of the dispersing section 24 relative to the bottle 10 the threads engage in the usual way. A final lock can be achieved by ensuring that the projections 24a/24b pass through the flat at the lower ring 30. Then a further twist is made so that the projections 24a/24b move away from the flats 16a/16b and engage the lower ring 30. Thus a lock is formed. A further alternative would be to push the projections 24a/b down to the flats 16a/16b in the ring 30, at which point the thread 14 and the dispersing section thread could be arranged to be in a position to engage and be tightened together in the usual way, by suitable relative positioning of the threads,<br>
It should be appreciated that the flats 16a/16b in the embodiment described in relation to figures 1 to 4 do not need to extend along the length of the neck 12 across the complete extent of the thread 14. In a variation on the first embodiment  it  is only necessary to allow the<br><br>
projections 24a/24b to move through the shortened flats l€a/16b until the thread 14 on the neck 12 engages the thread in the dispersing section 20. Thus the flats 16a/b may only cut across the highest ridge of the thread 14 -<br>
A further variation on the first embodiment would be to ensure that a highest section of the thread 14 was simply a raised ring e.g. 28 in Figure 1/ rather than part of a spiral thread, as in Figures 1 and 2. The raised ring 28 would have the flats 16a/16b as a part thereof to allow the passage of the projections 24a/24b. In this variation it would also be possible to dispense with the thread in the dispersing section 20, given that the projections 24a/24b could engage the lower part of the thread 14 and act as the threaded part of the dispersing section 20 without the need for a further thread element. In this variation the arrangement of the dispersing section would be as shown in Figure 1.<br>
When using the first embodiment and variations thereon described above it is clear that in order to secure the bottle 10 to the dispersing section 20 flats 16a/16b must be present in the thread 14 on the bottle neck 12. Thus, only bottles that have been authorised by the producer of the dispersing section 20 can be engaged thereon. This avoids the possibility of potentially dangerous or unsuitable bottles containing unsuitable and/or dangerous liquids from being secured to the dispersing section 20. Thus, contravention of the use requirements of the dispersing section 20 can be avoided.<br>
Figures 5 to 9 show a second embodiment of emanator. A number of parts of which are in common with the first<br><br>
embodiment and like numerals have been used to show like parts. Generally, the second embodiment may have . a structure similar to that shown in Figure 10, except for the engagement of the bottle and dispersing section. The second embodiment comprises a bottle 10 having a neck 12, which incorporates a thread 14. The neck 12 also incorporates a wick 18 (see Figure 5).<br>
The neck 12 incorporates a recess 40 which has a greater diameter than the wick 18. Thus, an annular opening is formed between the wick 18 and an interior wall of the neck 12. The dispersing section 20 incorporates an opening 22 which leads through to a smaller opening 26 into which the wick 18 projects in use. Projections 42a/b/c are spaced around the opening 26 which receives the wick 18. The projections 42a/b/c project downwardly and have a curved shield-like shape and also taper downwardly. The projections 42a/b/c are intended to be received in the recess 40 between the wick 18 and the interior wall of the neck 12. In an alternative configuration the projections 42a/b/c may be spaced away from the opening, whilst still being concentric around the opening.<br>
The opening 22 has an interior side wall with a thread corresponding to the thread 14 on the neck 12 of the bottle 10. The bottle 10 and the dispersing section 20 are engaged by relative rotation of the two to cause the threads to engage one another and form a tight seal. Engagement of the bottle 10 and the dispersing section 20 can only be achieved if there is a recess 4 0 in the neck of the bottle 12 which recess allows sufficient space for the projections 42a/b/c of the dispersing section 20 to<br><br>
project into the recess 40, whilst not causing poor functioning of the wick 18.<br>
The projections 42a/b/c are slightly curved so that they match the shape of the recess 40 and to allow relative rotation of the dispersing section and the bottle 10 whilst the projections 42a/b/c project into the recess 40.<br>
In view of the presence of the projections 42a/b/c in the opening 22 of the dispersing section 20 it is necessary for a bottle to have the corresponding recess 40. Thus, it is only possible to use bottles that have been authorised by the producer of the dispersing section 20 and incorporate the recess 40- This avoids the possibility of potentially dangerous or unsuitable bottles being used with the dispersing section 20.<br>
Whilst it is preferable to use projections of the dispersing section 20 as the means of preventing use• of unauthorised bottles, it would also be possible to have projections of the bottle being received in an opening of the dispersing section 20, if this was done in a way which prevented the use of unauthorised bottles.<br>
The emanator devices described herein may be used with air freshening materials. Also, any other suitable potentially volatile liquid which it is intended to disperse could be used within the bottle 10 for dispersal by the dispersing section 20. Typically, the material would be drawn up the wick 18 by capillary action into the dispersing section 20. The material would then be heated causing it to evaporate. A fan section would then disperse the evaporated material into the surrounding air.<br><br>
The dispersing section may be battery powered or may be plugged into an electrical socket to receive power.<br>
All of the embodiments described herein advantageously allow the correct use of the dispersing section, i.e. only with bottles approved for use with the dispersing section, because specially manufactured bottles must be used in conjunction with the specially manufactured dispersing sections to form an emanator that disperses an intended material in an intended manner. Thus potentially dangerous or inefficient functioning of the emanator can be avoided.<br>
