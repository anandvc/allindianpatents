THERAPEUTIC PEPTIDES AND METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of immunology. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to inflammation and the use of proteins and peptides containing certain<br>
sequences of the TREM-1 protein and their functional equivalents (referred to herein as<br>
TREM1-peptides) in the treatment of disease, for example, sepsis and septic shock.<br>
Sepsis constitutes a significant consumption of intensive care resources and remains an<br>
ever-present problem in the intensive care unit. It has been estimated that between 400 000 and<br>
500 000 patients are so affected each year in both the USA and Europe. Morbidity and mortality<br>
have remained high despite improvements in both supportive and anti- microbial therapies.<br>
Mortality rates vary from 40% for uncomplicated sepsis to 80% in those suffering from septic<br>
shock and multi-organ dysfunction. The pathogenesis of the conditions is now becoming better<br>
understood. Greater understanding of the complex network of immune, inflammatory and<br>
haematological mediators may allow the development of rational and novel therapies.<br>
Following an infection, innate and cognitive immune responses develop in sequential<br>
phases that build-up in specificity and complexity, resulting ultimately in the clearance of<br>
infectious agents and restoration of homeostasis. The innate immune response serves as the<br>
first line of defence and is initiated upon activation of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll -<br>
like receptors (TLRs) (1, 2), by various pathogen -associated microbial patterns (PAMPs) β).<br>
Activation of the TLRs triggers the release of large quantities of such cytokines as TNF -a and<br>
IL-1f5, which, in case of such massive infections as sepsis, can precipitate tissue injury and<br>
lethal shock (4, 5). Although antagonists of TNF -a and IL-1β appeared in this context as<br>
possibly interesting therapeutic agents of sepsis, they have unfortunately shown limited efficacy<br>
in clinical trials (6-8). This could be due to the fact that these cytokines are necessary for the<br>
clearance of infections, and that their removal would allow for fatal bacterial growth (9 -11).<br>
Another receptor involved in, inter alia, response to infection, t riggering receptor<br>
expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM -1) is a member of a recently discovered family of<br>
receptors, the TREM family, expressed on the surface of neutrophils and a subset of<br>
monocytes. TREM receptors activate myeloid cells via association with the adaptor molecule<br>
DAP12. Engagement of TREM -1 has been reported to trigger the synthesis of pro -inflammatory '<br>
cytokines in the presence of microbial products.<br>
The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) -1 is a recently discovered<br>
cell-surface molecule that has been identified both on human and murine polymorphonuclear<br>
neutrophils and mature monocytes (12). It belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and<br>
activates downstream signalling pathways with the help of an adapter protein called DAP12 (12 -<br>
15). Bouchon and co -workers have shown that the expression of TREM-1 was greatly up-<br>
regulated on neutrophils and monocytes in the presence of such bacteria as Pseudomonas<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
3<br>
aeruginosa or Staphytococcus aureus, both in cell culture and in tissue samples from patients<br>
with infection (16). In striking contrast, TREM-1 was not up- regulated in samples from patients<br>
with non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, ulcerative colitis or vasculitis<br>
caused by immune complexes (16). Moreover, when TREM-1 is bound to its ligand, there is a<br>
synergistic effect of LPS and an amplified synthesis of the pro- inflammatory cytokines TNF- a<br>
and GM-CSF, together with an inhibition of IL-10 production (17). In a murine model of LPS-<br>
induced septic shock, blockade of TREM -1 signalling protected the animals from death, further<br>
highlighting the crucial role of this molecule (13, 16).<br>
Recent studies demonstrate that TREM-1 plays a critical role in the inflammatory<br>
response to infection (see BOUCHON et al. (2000) J. Immunol. 164:4991 -4995). Expression of<br>
TREM-1 is increased on myeloid cells in response to both bacterial and fungal infections in<br>
humans. Similarly, in mice the induction of shock by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with<br>
increased expression of TREM -1. Further, treatment of mice with a soluble TREM -1/lg fusion<br>
protein, as a 'decoy' receptor, protects mice from death due to LPS or E.coii.<br>
US 6,420,526 entitled "186 Secreted Proteins" claims unspecified and unexemplified<br>
isolated fragments of TREM-1 containing at least 30 contiguous amino acids of human TREM-1.<br>
No biological data relating to such fragments are provided .<br>
As described in US2003165875A, fusion proteins between human lgG1 constant region<br>
and the extracellular domain of mouse TREM-1 or that of human TREM- 1 show an effect<br>
against endotoxemia in mice.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that certain peptides derived from the TREM -1<br>
protein are capable of acting as antagonists of the TREM-1 protein and therefore have<br>
applications in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. The Inventors further demonstrate that<br>
the same peptides also modulate in vivo the pro- inflammatory cascade triggered by infection,<br>
thus inhibiting hyper-responsiveness and death in an animal model of sepsis.<br>
Previously, the Inventors have identified a soluble form of TREM -1 (sTREM-1) and<br>
observed significant levels in serum samples from septic shock patients but not controls. As<br>
also described herein the Inventors have investigated its putative role in the modulation of<br>
inflammation during sepsis (see Gibot et al (2004) Ann. Intern. Med. 141(1):9-15 and Gibot et<br>
al. (2004) N. Engl. J. Med. 350(5):451 -8).<br>
As described herein the Inventors show that a soluble form of TREM-1 (sTREM -1) is<br>
released in the peripheral blood during infectious aggression in mouse. The Inventors also<br>
confirm monocytes as a major source of sTREM, and show that synthetic peptides mimicking a<br>
part of the extra-cellular domain of TREM-1 can modulate cytokine production by activated<br>
monocytes in vitro.<br>
The Inventors have observed that sTREM -1 is secreted by monocytes activated in vitro<br>
by LPS, as well as in the serum of animals involved in an experimental model of septic shock.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
4<br>
Both in vitro and in vivo, synthetic peptides mimicking a short highly conserved domain of<br>
sTREM-1 attenuate cytokine production by human monocytes and protect septic animals from<br>
hyper-responsiveness and death. These peptides are efficient not only in preventing but also in<br>
down-regulating the deleterious effects of pro -inflammatory cytokines. These data demonstrate<br>
that in vivo modulation of TREM -1 by TREM-1 peptides is a valuable therapeutic tool for the<br>
treatment of infection, for example sepsis or septic shock or for the treatment of sepsis-like<br>
conditions<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides methods and compositions for the treatment<br>
of infectious disease, in particular, sepsis and septic shock or for the treatment of sepsis-like<br>
conditions<br>
As described herein, the Inventors have determined that several peptides of the<br>
extracellular portion of the TREM-1 protein (see Table 1), which incorporate sequences from<br>
"CDR2" and "CDR3" surprisingly have activity similar to previously described fusion proteins of<br>
lgG1 constant region and the extracellular domain of TREM-1 in models of sepsis. These<br>
peptides also have advantages over the protein particularly in terms of cost of manufacture.<br>
Thus, the invention provides polypeptides comprising one or more sequences derived<br>
from CDR2 or CDR3 of a TREM-1 protein. Preferably, said polypeptides comprise less than 30<br>
contiguous amino acids of said TREM-1 protern.<br>
As shown in Table 1, examples of such peptides or polypeptides, contain or comprise for<br>
example 15-25 amino acid ("AA") peptides from the TREM-1 protein and contain or comprise all<br>
or part of a CDR domain β -6 AAs) of the receptor flanked by natural sequences from the<br>
protein that can vary in length so long as function of the CDR -like domain is not lost. Such<br>
peptides are derived from the TREM-1 receptor protein amino acid sequence for example, as<br>
shown in Table 2 (human) and Table 3 (mouse).<br>
Table 1 shows peptides derived from mouse TREM- 1 "mPX" (NCBI Reference<br>
Sequences (RefSeq) NP_067381) or human TREM-1 "hPX"" (NCBI Reference Sequences<br>
(RefSeq) NP_061113). Underlined amino acids span the human TREM -1 Complementarity<br>
Determining Regions (CDR), as described b y Radaev et al. 2003 Structure (Camb.) 11 (12),<br>
1527-1535(2003).<br>
Table 2 shows the human TREM-1 amino acid sequence NP_061113. Underlined amino<br>
acids span the human TREM-1 Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR) 2 (RPSKNS;<br>
[SEQ ID NO:20]) and 3 (QPPKE [SEQ ID NO:21]), as described by Radaev et al. 2003<br>
Structure (Camb.) 11 (12), 1527-1535(2003).<br>
Table 3 shows the mouse TREM-1 amino acid sequence NP_367381. Underlined amino<br>
acids span the mouse TREM-1 Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR) 2 (RPFT RP;<br>
[SEQ ID NO:22]) and 3 (HPPND; [SEQ ID NO:23]).<br><br>

Accordingly, the invention provides isolated or recombinantly prepared polypeptides or<br>
peptides comprising or consisting essentially of one or more sequences derived from CDR2 or<br>
CDR3 of a TREM-1 protein, or fragments, homologues, derivatives, fusion proteins or variants<br>
of such polypeptides, as defined herein, which are herein collectively referred to as<br>
"polypeptides or peptides of the invention" or "TREM-1 peptides or TREM-1 polypeptides",<br>
preferably such entities comprise less than 30 contiguous amino acids of a TREM -1 protein, for<br>
example as shown in Table 2 or Table 3. Generally where polypeptides or proteins of the<br>
invention or fragments, homologues, derivatives, or variants thereof are intended for use (for<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
6<br>
example treatment) in a particular species, the sequences of CDR2 or CDR3 of a TREM -1<br>
protein are chosen from the TREM-1 protein amino acid sequence of that species, or if the<br>
sequence is not known, an analogous species. For example, polypeptides or proteins of the<br>
invention for the treatment of human disease, in particular sepsis, septic shock or sepsis -like<br>
conditions, will comprise one or more sequences comprising ail or part of CDR2 or CDR3 from<br>
the human TREM-1 protein.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides isolated polypeptides or proteins comprising an<br>
amino acid sequence that is at least about 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98%<br>
identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:20 , 21,22, 23 or fragments, homologues,<br>
derivatives, or variants thereof. The invention also provides isolated peptides, polypeptides or<br>
proteins comprising an amino acid sequence that comprises or consists of at least about 3, 4, 5,<br>
6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12,13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 ,27 28 or 29 or more<br>
contiguous amino acids of a TREM-1 protein of which 3 or more contiguous amino acids are<br>
derived from the sequences of SEQ ID NO:20 , 21, 22 or 23 (in other words a sequence<br>
representing all, or part of CDR2 or CDR3 of a TREM-1 protein is present in the peptide,<br>
polypeptide or protein), or fragments, ho mologues, derivatives, or variants thereof. In preferred<br>
embodiments, such peptides, polypeptides or proteins, or fragments, homologues, derivatives<br>
or variants thereof have a biological activity of a TREM -1 full-length protein, such as<br>
antigenicity, immunogenicity, triggering of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines,<br>
mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+, protein tyrosine-phosphoryiation, mediator release, and other<br>
activities readily assayable. Generally, such peptides, polypeptides or proteins or fragments,<br>
homologues, derivatives or variants thereof are capable of treating sepsis, septic shock or<br>
sepsis-like conditions, or are active in experimental models of sepsis, septic shock or sepsis-like<br>
conditions, for example by acting as antagonists of the activit y of the TREM-1 receptor. Such<br>
peptides, polypeptides or proteins or fragments, homologues, derivatives or variants thereof are<br>
characterised by the ability to treat, ameliorate, or lessen the symptoms of sepsis, septic shock<br>
or sepsis-like conditions.<br>
In particular, the invention provides, a TREM-1 polypeptide having activity against<br>
sepsis, septic shock or sepsis-like conditions which consists of (i) a contiguous sequence of 5 to<br>
29, for example 15-25, amino acids corresponding to the native TREM -1 protein sequence<br>
which includes at least 3 amino acids from the CDR2 or CDR3 sequences; or (ii) such a<br>
sequence in which one or more amino acids are substituted conservatively with another amino<br>
acid provided, however that at least 3 amino acids from the CDR2 or CDR3 sequences are not<br>
substituted; or (iii) a sequence of (i) or (ii) linked at one or both of its N and C termini to a<br>
heterologous polypeptide. For example, in a polypeptide wherein the native TREM-1 protein<br>
sequence is the human sequence identified a s [SEQ ID NO: 1], the CDR2 and CDR3<br>
sequences are RPSKNS and QPPKE respectively. In such poiypeptides, the at least 3 amino<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
7<br>
acids from the CDR2 or CDR3 sequences can be QPP, PPK, PKE, RPS, PSK, SKN or KNS.<br>
Such polypeptides may comprise the sequence QPPK, QPPKE or RPSKNS. For example, in a<br>
polypeptide wherein the native TREM -1 protein sequence is the mouse sequence identified as<br>
[SEQ ID NO: 2] the CDR2 and CDR3 sequences are RPFTRP and HPPND respectively. In<br>
such polypeptides, the at least 3 amino acids from the CDR2 or CDR3 sequences can be HPP,<br>
PPN, PND, RPF, PFT, FTR or TRP. Such polypeptides may comprise the sequences HPP,<br>
HPPN, HPPND or RPFTRP.<br>
In certain embodiments, the polypeptide of the invention is or comprises SEQ ID No. 7<br>
which is disclosed in Gibot et al (2004) J Exp Med 200, 1419-1426..<br>
In certain embodiments the polypeptide of the invention neither is nor comprises SEQ ID<br>
No. 7.<br>
In certain embodiments the polypeptide of the invention is or comprises a sequence<br>
selected from SEQ ID Nos. 3, 4 and 6.<br>

The polypeptides or peptides of the invention are provided for use in therapy, in<br>
particular in the treatment of sepsis, septic shock and sepsis-like conditions, and for us e in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of sepsis , septic shock and sepsis-like<br>
conditions. Further provided are compositions and pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
polypeptides or peptides of the invention and methods of treatment of sepsis , septic shock and<br>
sepsis-like conditions using polypeptides or peptides of the invention. In addition the<br>

haemodynamic parameters in sepsis, septic shock and sepsis-like conditions and for use in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of aberrant haemodynamic parameters in<br>
sepsis, septic shock and sepsis-like conditions.<br>
The term "triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells" or "TREM" refers to a group of<br>
activating receptors which are selectively expressed on different types of myeloid cells, such as<br>
mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and neutrophils, and may have a<br>
predominant role in immune and inflammatory responses. TREMs ar e primarily transmembrane<br>
glycoproteins with a Ig-type fold in their extracellular domain and, hence, belong to the Ig-SF.<br>
These receptors contain a short intracellular domain, but lack docking motifs for signaling<br>
mediators and require adapter proteins, such as DAP12, for cell activation.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
8<br>
The term "myeloid cells" as used herein refers to a series of bone marrow- derived cell<br>
lineages including granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes,<br>
macrophages, and mast cells. Furthermore, peripheral blood dendritic cells of myeloid origin,<br>
and dendritic cells and macrophages derived in vitro from monocytes in the presence of<br>
appropriate culture conditions, are also included.<br>
The term "sepsis, septic shock" or "sepsis or septic shock" as defined herein, refers to<br>
sub-groups of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The term "sepsis" is generally<br>
reserved for SIRS when infection is suspected or proven. A pattern of physiological variables<br>
have been shown in critically ill patients in re sponse to a range of insults including; trauma,<br>
burns, pancreatitis and infection. These include inflammatory responses, leucocytosis or severe<br>
leucopaenia, hyperthermia or hypothermia, tachycardia and tachypnoea and have been<br>
collectively termed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This definition<br>
emphasises the importance of the inflammatory process in these conditions regardless of the<br>
presence of infection. Sepsis is further stratified into severe sepsis when there is evidence of<br>
organ hypoperfusion, made evident by signs of organ dysfunction such as hypoxaemia, oliguria,<br>
lactic acidosis or altered cerebral function. "Septic shock" is severe sepsis usually complicated<br>
by hypotension, defined in humans as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg despite<br>
adequate fluid resuscitation. Sepsis and SIRS may be complicated by the failure of two or more<br>
organs, termed multiple organ failure (MOF), due to disordered organ perfusion and<br>
oxygenation. In addition to systemic effects of infection, a sy stemic inflammatory response may<br>
occur in severe inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis and burns. The appearance of<br>
signs of an inflammatory response is less well defined following traumatic insults. In the<br>
intensive care unit, gram -negative bacteria are implicated in 50 to 60% of sepsis cases with<br>
gram-positive bacteria accounting for a further 35 to 40% of cases. The remainder of cases are<br>
due to the less common causes of fungi, viruses and protozoa.<br>
The term "sepsis-like conditions" as used herein refers to those states in which a patient<br>
presents with symptoms similar to sepsis or septic shock but where an infectious agent is not<br>
the primary or initial cause of a similar cascade of inflammatory mediators and/or change in<br>
haemodynamic parameters a s seen in cases of sepsis, for example in patients with acute or<br>
chronic liver failure (see Wasmuth HE, et al. J Hepatol. 2005 Feb;42(2):195 -201), in cases of<br>
post-resuscitation disease after cardiac arrest (see Adrie C et al. Curr Opin Crit Care. 2004<br>
Jun;10β):208-12) in the treatment of sepsis-like symptoms after cancer chemotherapy (see<br>
Tsuji E et al. Int J Cancer. 2003 Nov 1;107(2):303-8) in patients undergoing hyperthermic<br>
isolated limb perfusion with recombinant TNF- alpha or similar treatments (see Zwaveling JH et<br>
al. Crit Care Med. 1996 May;24(5):765 -70) or sepsis-like illness in neonates (see Griffin MP et<br>
al. Pediatr Res. 2003 Jun;53(6):920 -6).<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
9<br>
The term "activity against sepsis, septic shock or sepsis-like conditions" as used herein<br>
refers to the capability of a molecule, for example a peptide, polypeptide or engineered<br>
antibody, to treat sepsis, septic shock or sepsis -like conditions, or be active in experimental<br>
models of sepsis, septic shock or sepsis-like conditions, for example by acting as an antagonist<br>
of the activity of the TREM-1 receptor.<br>
Typically the indication for polypeptides of the invention is sepsis or septic-shock.<br>
The term "substantial sequence identity", when used in connection with peptides/amino<br>
acid sequences, refers to peptides/amino acid sequences which are substantially identical to or<br>
similar in sequence, giving rise to a homology in conformation and thus to similar biological<br>
activity. The term is not intended to imply a common evolution of the sequences.<br>
Typically, peptides/amino acid sequences having "substantial sequence identity" are<br>
sequences that are at least 50%, more preferably at least 80%, identical in sequence, at least<br>
over any regions known to be involved in the desired activity. Most preferably, no more than<br>
five residues, other than at the termini, are different. Preferably, the divergence in sequence, at<br>
least in the aforementioned regions, is in the form of "conservative modifications"<br>
To determine the percent sequence identity of two peptides/ amin o acid sequences or of<br>
two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes ( e.g.,<br>
gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid<br>
sequence for optimal alignment and non -homologous sequences can be disregarded for<br>
comparison purposes). For example, the length of a reference sequence aligned for<br>
comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%,<br>
even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the<br>
length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the first amino acid<br>
sequence which has for example 100 amino acid residues, at least 30, preferably at least 40,<br>
more preferably at least 50, even more preferably at least 60, and even more preferably at least<br>
70, 80 or 90 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at<br>
corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a<br>
position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the<br>
corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position<br>
(as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid "identity" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid<br>
"homology"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of<br>
identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the<br>
length of each gap, which need to be introd uced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.<br>
The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences<br>
can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In one embodiment, the percent identity<br>
between two amino acid se quences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol.<br>
Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
10<br>
GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a<br>
PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4, and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4,<br>
5, or 6. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is<br>
determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package {available at<br>
http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or<br>
80, and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In another embodiment, the percent identity<br>
between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the alg orithm of E.<br>
Meyers and W. Miiier (CABIOS, 4:11 -17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN<br>
program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a<br>
gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be<br>
used as a "query sequence" to perform a search against public databases to identify, for<br>
example, other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using<br>
the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et a/. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-<br>
10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100,<br>
wordlength = 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to NIP2b, NlP2cL, and NIP2cS<br>
nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the<br>
XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to<br>
NIP2b, NIP2cL, and NIP2cS protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments<br>
for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul etal., (1997)<br>
Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs,<br>
the default parameters of the respective programs ( e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used.<br>
See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.<br>
The terms "protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein. The term<br>
"peptide" is used herein to refer to a chain of two or more amino acids or amino acid analogues<br>
(including non-naturally occurring amino acids), with adjacent amino acids joined by peptide (-<br>
NHCO-) bonds. Thus, the peptides of the invention include oligopeptides, polypeptides,<br>
proteins, mimetopes and peptidomimetics. Methods for preparing mimetopes and<br>
peptidomimetics are known in the art.<br>
The terms "mimetope" and "peptidomimetic" are used interchangeably herein. A<br>
"mimetope" of a' compound X refers to a compound in which chemical structures of X necessary<br>
for functional activity of X have been replaced with other chemical structures which mimic the<br>
conformation of X. Examples of peptidomimetics include peptidic compounds in which the<br>
peptide backbone is substituted with one or more benzodiazepine molecules (see e.g., James,<br>
G.L. et ai. (1993) Science 260:1937-1942) and "retro-inverso" peptides (see U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,522,752 to Sisto). The terms "mimetope" and "peptidomimetic" also refer to a moiety, other<br>
than a naturally occurring amino acid, that conformationally and functionally serves as a<br>
substitute for a particular amino acid in a p eptide-containing compound without adversely<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
11<br>
interfering to a significant extent with the function of the peptide. Examples of amino acid<br>
mimetics include D-amino acids. Peptides substituted with one or more D- amino acids may be<br>
made using well known peptide synthesis procedures. Additional substitutions include amino<br>
acid analogues having variant side chains with functional groups, for example, b -cyanoalanine,<br>
canavanine, djenkolic acid, norleucine, 3-phosphoserine, homoserine, dihydroxyphenylalanine,<br>
5-hydroxytryptophan, 1 -methylhistidine, or 3-methylhistidine<br>
As used herein an "analogue" of a compound X refers to a compound which retains<br>
chemical structures of X necessary for functional activity of X, yet which also contains certain<br>
chemical structures which differ from X. An example of an analogue of a naturally -occurring<br>
peptide is a peptide which includes one or more non-naturally-occurring amino acids. The term<br>
"analogue" is also intended to include modified mimetopes and/or peptidomimetics, modi fied<br>
peptides and polypeptides, and allelic variants of peptides and polypeptides. Analogues of a<br>
peptide will therefore produce a peptide analogue that is substantially homologous or, in other<br>
words, has substantial sequence identity to the original peptide. The term "amino acid" includes<br>
its art recognized meaning and broadly encompasses compounds of formula I:<br><br>
Preferred amino acids include the naturally occu rring amino acids, as well as synthetic<br>
derivatives, and amino acids derived from proteins, e.g., proteins such as casein, i.e. , casamino<br>
acids, or enzymatic or chemical digests of, e.g., yeast, an animal product, e.g., a meat digest, or<br>
a plant product, e.g., soy protein, cottonseed protein, or a corn steep liquor (see, e.g., Traders'<br>
Guide to Fermentation Media, Traders Protein, Memphis, TN (1988), Biotechnology: A<br>
Textbook of Industrial Microbiology, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA (1989), and Product<br>
Data Sheet for Corn Steep Liquor, Grain Processing Corp., IO).<br>
The term "naturally occurring amino acid" includes any of the 20 amino acid residues<br>
which commonly comprise most polypeptides in living systems, rarer amino acids found in<br>
fibrous proteins (e.g., 4-hydorxyproline, 5-hydroxyIysine, -N-methyliysine, 3-methylhistidine,<br>
desmosine, isodesmosine), and naturally occurring amino acids not found in proteins (e.g. ,<br>
aminobutryic acid, homocysteine, homoserine, citrulline, ornithine, canavanine, d jenkolic acid,<br>
and -cyanoalanine).<br>
The term "side chain of a naturally occurring amino acid" is intended to include the side<br>
chain of any of the naturally occurring amino acids, as represented by R in formula 1. One<br>
skilled in the art will understand that the structure of formula 1 is intended to encompass amino<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
12<br>
acids such as praline where the side chain is a cyclic or heterocyclic structure (e.g. , in praline R<br>
group and the amino group form a five -membered heterocyclic ring.<br>
The term "homologue,".a s used herein refers to any member of a series of peptides or<br>
poiypeptides having a common biological activity, including antigenicity/immunogenicity and<br>
inflammation regulatory activity, and/or structural domain and having sufficient amino acid as<br>
defined herein. Such homologues can be from either the same or different species of animals.<br>
The term "variant" as used herein refers either to a naturally occurring allelic variation of<br>
a given peptide or a recombinantly prepared variation of a given peptide or protein in which one<br>
or more amino acid residues have been modified by amino acid substitution, addition, or<br>
deletion.<br>
The term "derivative" as used herein refers to a variation of given peptide or protein that<br>
are otherwise modified, i.e., by covalent a ttachment of any type of molecule, preferably having<br>
bioactivity, to the peptide or protein, including non -naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
Preferably, such homologues, variants and derivatives are capable of treating of sepsis,<br>
septic shock or sepsis-like conditions, or are active in experimental models of sepsis, septic<br>
shock or sepsis-like conditions, for example by acting as antagonists of the activity of the<br>
TREM-1 receptor.<br>
An "isolated" or "purified" peptide or protein is substantially free of cell ular material or<br>
other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or<br>
substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.<br>
The language "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of a<br>
polypeptide/protein in which the polypeptide/protein is separated from cellular components of<br>
the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, a polypeptide/protein that is<br>
substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of the polypeptide/protein having less<br>
than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, or 1 %, (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When<br>
the polypeptide/protein is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of<br>
culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 10%, or 5% of the volume<br>
of the protein preparation. When poiypeptide/protein is produced by chemical synthesis, it is<br>
preferably substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from<br>
chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein.<br>
Accordingly, such preparations of the polypeptide/protein have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%,<br>
5% (by dry weight) of chemical precu rsors or compounds other than polypeptide/protein<br>
fragment of interest. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, polypeptides/proteins<br>
are isolated or purified.<br>
In addition to the poiypeptides described above, poiypeptides of the invention also<br>
encompass those poiypeptides having a common biological activity and/or structural domain<br>
and having sufficient amino acid identity (homologues) as defined herein. These homologues<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
13<br>
can be from either the same or different species of animal, preferably from mammals, more<br>
preferably from rodents, such as mouse and rat, and most preferably from human. Preferably,<br>
they exhibit at least one structural and/or functional feature of TREM -1, and are preferably,<br>
capable of treating sepsis, septic shock or sepsis -like conditions, for example by acting as<br>
antagonists of the activity of the TREM -1 receptor. Such modifications include amino acid<br>
substitution, deletion, and/or insertion. Amino acid modifications can be made by any method<br>
known in the art and various methods are available to and routine for those skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, in making amino acid substitutions, generally the amino acid residue to be<br>
substituted can be a conservative amino acid substitution (i.e. "substituted conservatively"), for<br>
example, a polar residue is substituted with a polar residue, a hydrophilic residue with a<br>
hydrophilic residue, hydrophobic residue with a hydrophobic residue, a positively charged<br>
residue with a positively charged residue, or a negatively charged residue w ith a negatively<br>
charged residue. Moreover, generally, the amino acid residue to be modified is not highly or<br>
completely conserved across species and/or is critical to maintain the biological activities of the<br>
peptide and/or the protein it derives from.<br>
Peptides of the invention may be directly synthesised in any convenient way. Generally<br>
the reactive groups present (for example amino, thiol and/or carboxyl) will be protected during<br>
overall synthesis. A proportion of the peptides of the invention, i. e. th ose wherein the comprised<br>
amino acids are genetically coded amino acids, will be capable of being expressed in<br>
prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts by expression systems well known to the man skilled in the art.<br>
Methods for the isolation and purification of e. g. microbially expressed peptides are also well<br>
known. Polynucleotides which encode these peptides of the invention constitute further aspects<br>
of the present invention. As used herein, "polynucleotide" refers to a polymer of<br>
deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, in the form of a separate fragment or as a component<br>
of a larger construct, e. g. an expression vector such as a plasmid. Polynucleotide sequences of<br>
the invention include DNA, RNA and cDNA sequences. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic<br>
code, of course more than one polynucleotide is capable of encoding a particular peptide<br>
according to the invention. When a bacterial host is chosen for expression of a peptide, it may<br>
be necessary to take steps to protect the host from the expressed anti -bacterial peptide. Such<br>
techniques are known in the art and include the use of a bacterial strain which is resistant to the<br>
particular peptide being expressed or the expression of a fusion peptide with sections at one or<br>
both ends which disable the antibiotic ac tivity of the peptide according to the invention. In the<br>
latter case, the peptide can be cleaved after harvesting to produce the active peptide. If the<br>
peptide incorporates a chemical modification then the activity/stability of the expressed peptide<br>
may be low, and is only modulated by post-synthetic chemical modification<br>
Furthermore, the invention also encompasses derivatives of the polypeptides of the<br>
invention. For example, but not by way of limitation, derivatives may include peptides or<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
14<br>
proteins that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation,<br>
phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic<br>
cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical<br>
modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific<br>
chemical cleavage, acetylation, formyiation, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or<br>
more non-classical amino acids. Those skilled in the art will be aware of various methods for<br>
modifying peptides to increase potency, prolong activity and/or increase half-life. In one<br>
example (WO0210195) the modification is made via coupling through an amide bond with at<br>
least one conformationally rigid substituent, either at the N- terminal of the peptide, the C-<br>
terminal of the peptide, or on a free amino or carboxyl group along the peptide chain. Other<br>
examples of peptide modifications with similar effects are described, for example, in<br>
WO2004029081, WO03086444, WO03049684, WO0145746, WO0103723 and WO9101743.<br>
The invention further provides antibodies that comprise a peptide or polypeptide of the<br>
invention or that mimic the activity of peptides or polypeptides of the invention. Such antibodies<br>
include, but are not limited to: polyclonal, monoclonal, bi-specific, multi-specific, human,<br>
humanized, chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments,<br>
disulfide-linked Fvs, and fragments containing either a Vl_ or VH domain or even a<br>
complementary determining region (CDR) that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the<br>
invention. In another embodiment, antibodies can also be generated using various phage<br>
display methods known in the art. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2<br>
fragments can aiso be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in<br>
PCT publication WO 92/22324; Mullinax, et al., BioTechniques, 12(6):864 -869, 1992; and<br>
Sawai, et al, 1995, AJRI 34:26-34; and Better, etal., 1988, Science 240:1041-1043 ( each of<br>
which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). Examples of techniques that can be used to<br>
produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,946,778<br>
and 5,258,498; Huston, et al., 1991, Methods in Enzymology 203:46-88; Shu, et al., 1993, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:7995-7999; and Skerra, et al., 1988, Science 240:1038-1040. For<br>
some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may<br>
be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a<br>
molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species,<br>
such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a<br>
constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric<br>
antibodies are known in the art. See, e.g., Morrison, 1985, Science 229:1202; Oi, etal., 1986,<br>
BioTechniques 4:214; Gillies, et al., 1989, J. Immunol. Methods 125:191 -202; U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397; which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species that bind the<br>
desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining reg ions (CDRs) from the non-<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
15 <br>
human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule or in the case<br>
of the present invention, one or more CDRs derived from a TREM-1 protein. As known in the<br>
art, framework residues in the human framework regions can be substituted with the<br>
corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen<br>
binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by<br>
modelling of the interactions of the CD R and framework residues to identify framework residues<br>
important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues<br>
at particular positions. See, e.g., Queen, et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089; Riechmann, et a!.,<br>
1988, Nature 332:323, 1988, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for<br>
example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91/09967; U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,225,539; 5,530,101 and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596;<br>

Engineering, 7(6):805-814; Roguska, et al., 1994, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:969 -973, and<br>
chain shuffling (U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entireties.<br>
Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of<br>
human patients. Human antibodies can be made b y a variety of methods known in the art<br>
including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human<br>
immunoglobulin sequences. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT<br>
publications WO 98/46645; WO 98/50433; WO 98/24893; WO 98/16654; WO 96/34096; WO<br>
96/33735; and WO 91/10741, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice (see Lonberg and Huszar<br>
(1995), int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing<br>
human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such<br>
antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98/24893; WO 92/01047; WO 96/34096; WO<br>
96/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425;<br>
5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; and 5,939,598; which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In addition, companies such as Abgenix,<br>
Inc. (Freemont, CA), Medarex (NJ) and Genpharm (San Jose, CA) can be engaged to provide<br>
human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described<br>
above. Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated<br>
using a technique referred to as "guided selection." In this approach a selected non -human<br>
monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely<br>
human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., 1988, Bio/technology 12:899-<br>
903). Antibodies fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may be used in in vitro<br>
immunoassays and in purification methods (e.g., affinity chromatography) well known in the art.<br><br>

In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for identifying a compound or<br>
ligand that binds to or modulates the activity of a polypeptide of the invention. Such a method<br>
comprises measuring a biological activity of the poiypeptide in the presence or absence of a test<br>
compound and identifying test compounds that alter (increase or decrease) the biological<br>
activity of the polypeptide.<br>
in one embodiment, the invention provides a fusion protein comprising a bioactive<br>
molecule and one o r more domains of a polypeptide of the invention or fragment thereof. In<br>
particular, the present invention provides fusion proteins comprising a bioactive molecule<br>
recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non -covalent<br>
conjugations) to one or more domains of a polypeptide of the invention or fragments thereof.<br>
The present invention further encompasses fusion proteins in which the polypeptides of<br>
the invention or fragments thereof, are recombinantly fused or chemically conju gated (including<br>
both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to heterologous polypeptides (i.e., an unrelated<br>
polypeptide or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least<br>
50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the<br>
polypeptide) to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but<br>
may occur through linker sequences.<br>
In one example, a fusion protein in which a polypeptide of the invention or a fragment<br>
thereof can be fused to sequences derived from various types of immunoglobulins. For<br>
example, a polypeptide of the invention can be fused to a constant region (e.g., hinge, CH2, and<br>
CH3 domains) of human lgG1 or IgM molecule, (for example, as described by Hudson &amp;<br>
Souriauso (2003) Nature Medicine 9(1):129- 134) so as to make the fused polypeptides or<br>
fragments thereof more soluble and stable in vivo . The short half-life of antibody fragments can<br>
also be extended by 'pegylation', that is, a fusion to polyethylene glycol (see Leong, S.R. et al.<br>
(2001) Cytokine 16:106-119). In one example of such fusions, described in WO0183525, Fc<br>
domains are fused with biologically active peptides. A pharmacologically active compound is<br>
produced by covalently linking an Fc domain to at least one amino acid of a selected peptide.<br>
Linkage to the vehicle increases the half-life of the peptide, which otherwise could be quickly<br>
degraded in vivo<br>
Alternatively, non-classical alternative protein scaffolds (for exa mple see Nygren &amp;<br>
Skerra (2004) J Immunol Methods 290(1 -2):3-28 or WO03049684) can be used to incorporate,<br>
and replicate the properties of, the peptides of the invention, for example by inserting peptide<br>
sequences derived from TREM -1 CDR2 or CDR3 into a protein framework to support<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
17-<br>
conformationally variable loops having structural/functional similarities to CDR2 or CDR3 in a<br>
fixed spatial arrangement<br>
Such fusion proteins or scaffold based proteins can be used as an immunogen for the<br>
production of specific antibodies which recognize the polypeptides of the invention or fragments<br>
thereof. In another preferred embodiment, such fusion proteins or scaffold based proteins can<br>
be administered to a subject so as to inhibit interactions between a ligand and its receptors in<br>
vivo. Such inhibition of the interaction will block or suppress certain cellular responses involved<br>
in sepsis and septic shock.<br>
in one aspect, the fusion protein comprises a polypeptide of the invention which is fused<br>
to a heterofogous signa I sequence at its N-terminus. Various signal sequences are<br>
commerciaily available. For example, the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental<br>
alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) are available as eukaryotic heterologous signal<br>
sequences. As examples of prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences, the phoA secretory<br>
signal (Sambrook, et al., supra; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1992, Ausubel, et<br>
al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons) and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech;<br>
Piscataway, NJ) can be listed. Another example is the gp67 secretory sequence of the<br>
baculovirus envelope protein (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1992, Ausubel, et al.,<br>
eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons).<br>
In another embodiment, a poiypeptide of the invention can be fused to tag sequences,<br>
e.g., a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259<br>
Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, CA, 91311), among others, many of which are commercially<br>
available. As described in Gentz, et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824, for<br>
instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other<br>
examples of peptide tags are the hemagglutinin "HA" tag, which corresponds to an epitope<br>
derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson, et al., 1984, Cell 37:767) and the<br>
"flag" tag (Knappik, et al., 1994, Biotechniques 17(4):754-761). These tags are especially useful<br>
for purification of recombinantly produced polypeptides of the invention.<br>
Fusion proteins can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques or by protein<br>
synthetic techniques, e.g., by use of a peptide synthesizer. For example, a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding a fusion protein can be synthesized by conventional techniques including<br>
automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be<br>
carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two<br>
consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to g enerate a<br>
chimeric gene sequence (see, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1992, Ausubel, et<br>
al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons). The nucleotide sequence coding for a fusion protein can be<br>
inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary<br>
elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein -coding sequence. Various<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
18<br>
host-vector systems and selection systems are known. In a specific embodiment, the<br>
expression of a fusion protein is regulated by a constitutive promoter. In another embodiment,<br>
the expression of a fusion protein is regulated by an inducible promoter. In accordance with<br>
these embodiments, the promoter may be a tissue -specific promoter. Expression vectors<br>
containing inserts of a gene encoding a fusion protein can be identified by three general<br>
approaches: (a) nucleic acid hybridization, (b) presence or absence of "marker" gene functions,<br>
and (c) expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach, the presence of a gene<br>
encoding a fusion protein in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization<br>
using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to an inserted gene encoding the<br>
fusion protein. In the second approach, the recombinant vector/host system can be identified<br>
and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain "marker" gene functions (e.g.,<br>
thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, transformation phenotype, occlusion body<br>
formation in baculovirus, etc.) caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a<br>
fusion protein in the vector. For example, if the nucleotide sequence encoding the fusion<br>
protein is inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the<br>
gene encoding the fusion protein i nsert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene<br>
function. In the third approach, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying<br>
the gene product (i.e., fusion protein) expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be<br>
based, for example, on the physical or functional properties of the fusion protein in in vitro assay<br>
systems, e.g., binding with anti-fusion protein antibody. For long- term, high-yield production of<br>
recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably<br>
express the fusion protein may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which<br>
contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by<br>
appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promo ter, enhancer, sequences, transcription<br>
terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of<br>
the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 -2 days in an enriched medium,<br>
and then are switched to a selective medium. The selectable marker in the recombinant<br>
plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into<br>
their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into ceil<br>
lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines that express the<br>
differentially expressed or pathway gene protein. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly<br>
useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that affect the endogenous activity of the<br>
differentially expressed or pathway gene protein. Once a fusion protein of the invention has<br>
been produced by recombinant expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art<br>
for purification of a protein, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity,<br>
particularly by affinity for the specific antibody, and sizing column chromatography),<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
19<br>
centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of<br>
proteins.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for treating a subject suffering from sepsis,<br>
septic shock or a sepsis-like condition by administering a peptide or polypeptide of the<br>
invention. In another embodiment, the modulator may be an antibody which mimics the activity<br>
of a polypeptide of the invention. In particular, the invention provides a method of treating or<br>
ameliorating sepsis, septic shock or a sepsis-like condition in a subject, comprising:<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide or polypeptid e of any one of the<br>
preceding claims to a subject. In such methods, the peptide or polypeptide administered can<br>
have substantial sequence identity to sequence SEQ ID NOS: 3, 4, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18 or 19, is<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 3, 4, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18 or 19, or an active fragment, analogue or derivative of SEQ<br>
ID NOS: 3,4, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18 or 19 or has at least about 80% sequence identity to SEQ ID<br>
NOS: 3, 4, 6,7, 16, 17, 18 or 19<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method for preventing sepsis, septic shock or<br>
sepsis-like conditions, by administering to the subject a peptide or polypeptide of the invention.<br>
Subjects at risk of sepsis or septic shock can be identified by, for example, any diagnostic or<br>
prognostic assays as known in the art {for particularly suitable methods of diagnosis, see<br>
WO2004081233, Gibot et al. (2004) Ann Intern Med. 141(1):9-15 and Gibot et al. (2004) N Engl<br>
J Med. 350(5):451 -8. The prophylactic agents described herein, for example, can be used to<br>
treat a subject at risk of developing disorders such as those previously discussed. The methods<br>
of the invention are applicable to mammals, for example humans, non human primates, sheep,<br>
pigs, cows, horses, goats, dogs, cats and rodents, such as mouse and rat. Generally, the<br>
methods of the invention are to be used with human subjects.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
polypeptide of the present invention or an antibody or fragments thereof that mimics a<br>
polypeptide of the invention. The peptides, polypeptides and antibodies (also referred to herein<br>
as "active compounds") of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions<br>
suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise the peptide, protein, or<br>
antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
As used herein the language " pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient"<br>
is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption d elaying agents, and the like, compatible with<br>
pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active<br>
substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is<br>
incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
20<br>
The invention includes methods for preparing pharmaceutical compositions containing a<br>
peptide or polypeptide of the invention. Such compositions can further include additional active<br>
agents. Thus, the invention further includes methods for preparing a pharmaceutical<br>
composition by formulating a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a peptide or polypeptide<br>
of the invention and one or more additional active compounds.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its<br>
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g.,<br>
intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, transdermal (topical), transmucosal, intra-articular,<br>
intra peritoneal, and intrapleural, as well as oral, inhalation, and rectal administration. Solutions<br>
or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous applicat ion can include the<br>
following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,<br>
polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents<br>
such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parab ens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium<br>
bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates,<br>
citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or<br>
dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium<br>
hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or<br>
multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectab le use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous<br>
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. For intravenous administration,<br>
suitable carriers include physiological sa line, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL ™ (BASF;<br>
Parsippany,' NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be<br>
sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy injectability with a syringe exists. It must be<br>
stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a<br>
solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures<br>
thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as<br>
lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the<br>
use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid,<br>
thimerosal, and the like. In many ca ses, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition.<br>
Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the<br>
composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and<br>
gelatin.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
21<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g.,<br>
a polypeptide or antibody) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a<br>
combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization.<br>
Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle<br>
which contains a basic dispersion medium and the require d other ingredients from those<br>
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectabie<br>
solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which<br>
yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously<br>
sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be<br>
enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic<br>
administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of<br>
tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant<br>
materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and<br>
the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder<br>
such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient, such as starch or<br>
lactose; a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid, Primogel, or com starch; a lubricant, such<br>
as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant, such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening<br>
agent, such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent, such as peppermint, methyl<br>
salicylate, or orange flavoring.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol<br>
spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas<br>
such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.<br>
Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For<br>
transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be<br>
permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and<br>
include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid<br>
derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays<br>
or suppositories. For transdermal administration , the active compounds are formulated into<br>
ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be<br>
prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa<br>
butter and other glycerid es) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the<br>
compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation,<br>
including implants and microe ncapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible<br>
polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
22<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from<br>
Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes<br>
targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral co mpositions in dosage unit<br>
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein<br>
refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each<br>
unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for<br>
the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique<br>
characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and<br>
the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of<br>
individuals.<br>
As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an<br>
effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25<br>
mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more<br>
preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body<br>
weight.<br>
For antibodies, the preferred dosage is 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight<br>
(generally 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). If the antibody is to act in the brain, a dosage of 50 mg/kg to<br>
100 mg/kg is usually appropriate. Generally, partially human antibodies and fully human<br>
antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than other antibodies. Accordingly,<br>
lower dosages and less frequent administration is often possible. Modifications such as<br>
lipidation can be used to stabilize antibodies and to enhance uptake and tissue penetration<br>
(e.g., into the brain). A method for lipidation of antibodies is described by Cruikshank, et al.,<br>
1997, J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology 14:193).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser<br>
together with instructions for administration.<br>
The invention further provides a kit containing a peptide or polypeptide of the invention<br>
of the present invention, o r an antibody or fragments thereof mimicking a polypeptide of the<br>
invention, preferably with instructions for use, for example in the treatment of sepsis, septic<br>
shock or sepsis-like conditions.<br>
The invention provides a method for identifying (or screening) modulators, i.e., candidate<br>
or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules or other drugs)<br>
which mimic a polypeptide of the invention or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for<br>
example, activity of a polypeptide of the invention. In particular, the invention provides a method<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
23<br>
of screening compounds or compositions to treat sepsis, septic shock or sepsis-like conditions,<br>
comprising: providing a TREM -1 peptide; contacting an animal in a cecal ligation and puncture<br>
model (or using other assay or model as described herein or known in the art) with the TREM-1<br>
peptide; determining if there was a modul ation in the sepsis, for example wherein an increase in<br>
survival indicates that the TREM-1 peptide may be useful for treating sepsis, septic shock or<br>
sepsis-like conditions.<br>
The invention further pertains to novel agents identified by the above- described<br>
screening assays and uses thereof for treatments as described herein.<br>
All publications, including but not limited to patents and patent applications, cited in this<br>
specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication were<br>
specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference herein as though fully set<br>
forth.<br>
Preferred features of each aspect of the invention are applicable to each other aspect,<br>
mutatis mutandis.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
examples, with reference to the figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1A. shows a sequence alignment of TREM -1 and TREM-2 family members. Human<br>
TREM-1 was aligned with mouse TREM -1 and human and mouse TREM -2 using version 1.74<br>
of CLUSTAL W. Secondary structure assignments correspond to the published human TREM -1<br>
structure (arrows for p -strands and cylinder for a helices) (Radaev et al. (2003) Structure<br>
(Camb).Dec;11(12):1527-35). Residues involved in homo-he terodimer formation are shown in<br>
white on black background. Cysteine making disulfide bonds conserved for V- type Ig fold are in<br>
bold. Gaps are indicated with (-), identical residues with (*), similar with (: or.). An extended<br>
region of similarities between human and mouse TREM1 sequences is shown in boxes on grey<br>
background. TREM-1 peptide sequences used in the Examples herein are indicated<br>
underlined.<br>
Figure 1B. shows a ribbon diagram of the published TREM-1 homodimeric structure (Kelker, et<br>
al. (2004) J Mol Biol. Sep 24;342{4):1237 -48). Postulated binding sites that comprise the<br>
antibody equivalent Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are in red.<br>
Figure 2. shows that administration of TREM-1 peptides, 1 hour before LPS, reduces death<br>
induced by endotoxaemla. BALB/c mice (10 per group) were injected intraperitoneally with 200<br>
µg LPS. The TREM-1 peptides P1, P2, P3, or P5 (200 µl of a 300 µM solution per mouse) were<br>
injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before LPS. Viability of mice was monitored twice a day for 7<br>
days. Statistical analysis was performed by Logrank test. Data from control mice represent<br><br>

24<br>
cumulative survival curves from two independent experiments performed under identical<br>
conditions.<br>
Figure 3. shows that TREM -1 peptide P1 is able to effectively reduce death induced by<br>
endotoxaemia when injected at 4 hours after LPS. BALB/cmice(10 per group) were injected<br>
intraperitoneally with 200 µg LPS. TREM -1 peptide P1, 200 µl of a 300 µM solution per mouse<br>
was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before or 4 hours after LPS. Viability of mice was<br>
monitored twice a day for 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed with the Logrank test. Data<br>
from control mice represent cumulative survival curves from two independent experiments<br>
performed under identical conditions<br>
Figure 4. shows that administration of TREM-1 peptides, 4 hours after LPS, reduces death<br>
induced by endotoxaemia. BALB/c mice (10 per group) were injected intraperitoneally with 200<br>
µg LPS. P1 peptide, 200 µl of a 150, 300 and 600 µM solution per mouse (dots) or P3, 200 µl<br>
of a 600 JIM solution per mouse (filled squares) were injected intraperitoneally 4 hours after<br>
LPS. Viability of mice was monitored twice a day for 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed<br>
with the Logrank test<br>
Figure 5. shows that TREM-1 peptide P1 protects against cecai ligation and puncture (CLP).<br>
CLP was induced in C57BL/6 mice (15 per group) as described in Materials and Methods. P1<br>
peptide (empty dots) or P3 peptide (filled squares) (200 µl of a 600 µM solution per mouse)<br>
were injected intraperitoneally 5 and 24 hours after CLP induction. Viability of mice was<br>
monitored twice a day for 10 days. Statistical analysis was performed with the Logrank test.<br>
Figure 6. shows that P1, P2 and P5 peptides, but not P3 peptide, inhibit the binding of soluble<br>
TREM-1/lgG1 to TREM-1 Ligand positive peritoneal exudate cells. Cytofluorimetric analysis of<br>
peritoneal exudate cells with 2 ug/ml of mouseTREM-1/hlgG1 in the presence of a 500µM<br>
solution per mouse (thin line), 100µM solution per mouse (dotted line) or absence (thick line) of<br>
the peptides is shown. The grey h istogram represents immunostaining with human igG1 as a<br>
control.<br>
Figure 7A. shows the release of sTREM -1 from cultured monocytes after stim ulation with LPS<br>
with and without proteases inhibitor. LPS stimulation induced the appearance of a 27 -kD protein<br>
that was specifically recognized by an anti -TREM-1 mAb (inset). sTREM-1 levels in the<br>
conditioned culture medium were measured by reflectance o f immunodots. Data are shown as<br>
mean ±SD (n=3).<br><br>

Figure 7B. shows expression of TREM-1 mRNA in monocytes. Cultured monocytes were<br>
stimulated with LPS(1ug/mL)forO, 1 and 16 hours as indicated. LPS induced TREM -1 mRNA<br>
production within 1 hour.<br>
Figure 8A. shows the release of cytokines and sTREM-1 from cultured monocytes. For cell<br>
activation, primary monocytes were cultured in 24 -well flat-bottom tissue culture plates in the<br>
presence of LPS (1ug/ml_). In some experiments this stimulus was provided in combin ation with<br>
P5 {10 to 100 ng/mL), control peptide (10 to 100 ng/mL) or rIL -10 (500 U/mL). To activate<br>
monocytes through TREM-1, an agonist anti-TREM-1 mAb(10ug/mL)was added as indicated.<br>
Cell-free supernatants were analysed for production of TNF-α, IL -1β and sTREM-1 by ELISA or<br>
immunodot. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as means<br>

Figure 8B. shows the effect of P5 on NFKB activation. Monocytes were cultured for 24 hours in<br>
the presence of E.coli LPS (0111 :B4, 1 ug/mL), anti -TREM-1 mAb (10ug/mL) and / or P5 (100<br>
ng/mL) as indicated and the levels of NFKB p50 and p65 were determined using an ELISA-<br>
based assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as means of<br>
optical densities (SEM).<br>
Figure 9. shows accumulation'of sTREM-1 in serum of LPS- treated mice.<br>
Male Balb/C mice (20 to 23 g) were treated with LPS (LD 50, intraperitoneally). Serum was<br>
assayed for sTREM-1 by immunodot. Serum sTREM -1 was readily detectable 1 hour after LPS<br>
administration and was maintained at a plateau level from 4 to 6 hours.<br>
Figure 10A. shows that P5 pre-treatment protects against LPS lethality in mice. Male Balb/C<br>
mice (20 to 23g) were randomly grouped (10 mice per group) and treated with an LD 100of LPS.<br>
P5(50ug or 100ug) or control vector was administered 60 min before LPS.<br><br>

Figure 10B. shows that delayed administration of P5 protects LPS lethality in mice. Male Balb/C<br>
mice (20 to 23 g) were randomly grouped (8 mice per group) and treated with an LD 100 of LPS.<br>
P5 (75ug) or control vector was administered 4 or 6 hours after LPS as indicated.<br>
Figure 10C. shows that administration of agonist TREM-1 mAb is lethal to mice. Male Balb/C<br>
mice (20 to 23 g) were randomly grouped (8 mice per group) and treated with a combination of<br>
an LD50 of LPS + control vector, LD 50 of LPS + anti-TREM-1 mAb (5ug) or LD100 of LPS +<br>
control vector as indicated. Control vector and anti -TREM-1 mAb were administered 1 hour after<br>
LPS injection<br>
Figure 11 A. shows that P5 partially protects mice from CLP-induced lethality. Male Balb/C mice<br>
(20 to 23g) were randomly grouped and treated with normal saline (n=14) or the controi peptide<br>
(n=14, 100ug)orwith P5 (100ug) in a single infection at HO (n=18), H+4 (n=18) or H+24 (n=18).<br>
The last group of mice (n=18) was treated with repeated injections of P5 (100ug) at H+4, H+8<br>
and H+24.<br>
Figure 11B. shows the dose effect of P5 on survival. Mice (n=15 per group) were treated with a<br>
single injection of normal saline or 10µg, 20µg, 50µg 100µg or 200µg of P5at HO after the CLP<br>
and monitored for survival<br>
Figure 12. shows that P5 has no effect on bacterial counts during CLP. Mice (5 per group) were<br>
killed under anaesthesia at 24 hours after CLP. Bacterial counts in peritoneal lavage fluid and<br>
blood were determined and results are expressed as CFU per mL of blood and CFU per mouse<br>
for the peritoneal lavage.<br>

Example 1: TREM-1 peptides protect mice from death by septic shock.<br>
TREM-1 peptides matching the following criteria were synthesized: i) highest homology<br>
between human and mouse TREM -1 and lowest homology with TREM-2. ii) peptides spanning<br>
the Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) of TREM -1. According to the published<br>
crystal structure of TREM-1, and in analogy with antibodies, these residues are likely to be<br>

was designed in the CDR2 region and three peptides (P2, P4 and P5) in the CDR3 region. A<br>
fourth peptide (P3) was designed in the neck region connecting the V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) -<br>
like domain (ig-V) to the trans-membrane domain. No peptide was designed in the CDR1<br>
region due to high sequence homology between TREM -1 and TREM-2.<br>

In the experiments of this example, the peptides were admi nistered in a volume of 200µl<br>
of the solution molarity indicated. To assess the ability of TREM1-peptides to protect mice from<br>
LPS-induced endotoxaemia, the Inventors administered peptides P1, P2, P3 and P5 (300 µM) 1<br>
hour before a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure 2). Lethality was monitored over<br>
time and compared with animals that had received control injections of vehicle alone. P5<br>
injection confers maximal protection, with 90% of the animals still alive 7 days after LPS<br>
injection, as compared with 10% of control mice(p

of TREM-1 corresponding to the putative ligand binding site (CDR2 and CDR3) can protect mice<br>
from lethal shock.<br>
In order to investigate whether TREM-1 peptide treatment could be d elayed until after<br>
the administration of LPS, the Inventors injected the peptides at 4 hours after LPS injection.<br>
Only in the case of P1, this delayed treatment conferred significant protection against a lethal<br>
dose of LPS (Figure 3). 80 % of the mice injected with P14 hours after LPS survived<br>
endotoxaemia compared to 60 % of mice treated 1 h before LPS and 10 % of mice treated with<br>
vehicle alone (p
the outbreak of endotoxaemia. No late death occurred over one week, indicating that P1 did not<br>
merely delay the onset of LPS lethality, but provided lasting protection. P1 administration<br>
conferred maximal protection (80 %) when administered at 600 µ M (p
protection dropped to 50 % at 300 µM (p
compared to 20% of control mice, indicating a dose dependent effect of P1 (Figure 4). The<br>
Inventors then investigated whether P1 protects again st septic shock in the "CLP" model (Cecal<br>
Ligation and Puncture is a widely used experimental model of sepsis). Mice treated with two<br>
doses of P1 at 5 and 24 hours after CLP were protected from death as compared to control<br>
treated mice (p=0.0791) although the difference was not statistically significant. 40 % of the<br>
mice injected with P1 at 5 days after CLP survived compared to 5 % of mice treated with P3<br>
peptide. At 10 days after CLP, the treated mice were still alive, indicating that P1 did not merely<br>
delay mortality, but provided lasting protection (Figure 5).<br>
Example 2: TREM-1 peptide P1 inhibits binding of soluble mouse TREM- 1/lgG to TREM-1<br>
ligand positive cells<br>
Among TREM-1 derived peptides tested in CLP, peptides P1, P2 and P5 demonstrate a<br>
protective activity. A possible mechanism of action could be the ability of TREM -1 derived<br>
peptide to interfere with TREM-1/TREM-1 ligand interaction. To address this question the<br><br>

Inventors performed competition experiments on TREM -1 ligand positive cells: PEC (Peritoneal<br>
Exudate Cells) from CLP treated mice.<br>
Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from mice suffering from a caecal ligation and puncture<br>
(CLP)-induced peritonitis were subjected to flow cytometry analysis after incubation with a PE-<br>
conjugated anti-human lgG1 (Jackson Immunoresearch, Bar Harbor, USA). Competition with<br>
TREM-1 peptides was performed by pre-incubating cells with the indicated concentrations of<br>
peptides for 45 minutes on ice before adding mTREM-1-lgG1.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the P1 peptide, derived from the CDR2 region of mTREM -1, and<br>
the P2 and P5 peptides spanning the CDR3 region inhibit TREM-1 interaction with its ligand in a<br>
dose dependent manner. Conversely the P3 peptide, derived from the neck region of TREM-1<br>
connecting the IgG like portion to the transmembrane domain was ineffective.<br>

Methods<br>
Preparation of monocytes from peripheral blood<br>
Ten ml_ of peripheral blood samples were collected on EDTA-K from 5 healthy volunteer<br>
donors originating from laboratory staff. After dilution in RPMI (Life Technologies, Grand Island,<br>
NY) v/v, blood was centrifuged for 30 min at room temperature over a Ficoll gradient<br>
(Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to isolate PBMC. The cells recovered above the<br>
gradient were washed and counted. In order to deplete the suspensions of lymphocytes, celts<br>
were then plated in 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at a<br>
concentration of 5x106/mL and allowed to adhere during 2 hours at 37°C. The resulting<br>
lymphocyte suspension was discarded and the adhering monocytic cells were maintained in a<br>
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C in complete medium (RPMI 1640, 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM<br>
Penicillin, 50 µg/mL Streptomycin; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen,<br>
Cergy, France).<br>
TREM-1 peptide<br>
Using the human TREM -1 sequence in Gen-Bank, accession #AF287008 and the<br>
mouse TREM-1 sequence #AF241219, a peptide "P5" (LQVTDSGLYRCVIYHPP; [SEQ ID<br>
NO:7]; was chemically synthesized as a C-terminally amidated peptide (Pepscan Systems,<br>
Lelystad, The Netherlands). The correct peptide was obtained in greater than 99% yield and<br>
with measured mass of 1961 Da versus a calculated mass of 1962 Da and was homogeneous<br>
after preparative purification, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and analytic reversed phase -<br>
high performance liquid chromatography. A peptide "P5sc" containing the same amino-acids<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
30<br>
than P5 but in a different sequence order (TDSRCVIGLYHPPLQVY; [SEQ ID NO:9] ) was<br>
similarly synthesized and served as 'control peptide'.<br>
In vitro stimulation of monocytes<br>
For activation, monocytes were cultured in the presence of E.coli LPS (0111 :B4,<br>
1 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, La Verpilliere, France). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue<br>
exclusion and by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. In some experiments, this stimulus<br>
was given in combination with TNF-a (5 to 100 ng/mL, R&amp;D Systems, Lille, France), IL-1p (5 to<br>
100 ng/mL, R&amp;D Systems), rlFN-y (up to 100 U/m L, R&amp;D Systems), rlL-10 (500 U/ml, R&amp;D<br>
Systems) or up to 100 ng/mL of P5 or control peptide.<br>
In order to activate monocytes through TREM -1, an anti-TREM-1 agonist monoclonal antibody<br>
(R&amp;D Systems) was added as follows: flat- bottom plates were precoated with 10 µg/mL anti-<br>
TREM-1 per well. After thorough washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the monocyte<br>
suspensions were added at a similar concentration as above. Some experiments were<br>
performed in the presence of protease inhibitors (PMSF and Protease C ocktail Inhibitor;<br>
Invitrogen). Ceil-free supernatants were assayed for the production of TNF-a and IL -1pby<br>
ELISA according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (BD Biosciences, San Diego,<br>
USA). To address the effect of P5 on NF-KB activity in monocytes, an ELISA-based assay was<br>
performed (BD Mercury™ Transfactor Kit, BD Biosciences). Monocytes were cultured for 24<br>
hours in the presence of E.coli LPS (O111:B4, 1ug/mL), and/or an agonist anti -TREM-1<br>
monoclonal antibody (10µg/mL), and / or P5 (100 ng/mL). Whole -cell extracts were then<br>
prepared and levels of NF- KB p50 and p65 were determined according to the recommendations<br>
of the manufacturer. Ali experiments were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as<br>
means (SEM).<br>
Identification and quantisation of sTREM-1 release<br>
Primary monocytes suspensions were cultured as described above. The cells were<br>
treated with E.coli LPS (0111 :B4,1 µg/mL) for 24 hours at 37°C. Ceil -conditioned medium was<br>
submitted to Western-blotting using an anti -TREM-1 monoclonal antibody (R&amp;D Systems) in<br>
order to confirm the presence of 27 kDa material recognized by anti -TREM-1. Soluble TREM-1<br>
levels were measured by assessing the optical intensity of bands on immunodots by means of a<br>
reflectance scanner and the Quantity One Quantitation Software (Bio-Rad, Cergy, France) as<br>
reported elsewhere (18). Soluble TREM-1 concentration from each sample was determined by<br>
comparing the optical densities of the samples with reference to standard curves generated with<br>
purified TREM-1. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The sensitivity of this<br>
technique allows the detection of sTREM -1 levels as low as 5pg/mL.<br><br>

TREM-1 RT-PCR<br>
Total mRNA was extracted from primary monocytes cultured in the presence of LPS<br>
using a TRIzol reagent (I nvitrogen), and reverse transcribed using Superscript RT II (Invitrogen)<br>
to generate cDNA. RT-PCR conditions then used for all reactions were 94°C, 30s/65°C,<br>
30s/68°C, 1 min for 30 cycles. Amplification was performed with 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP,<br>
2.0 U Taq polymerase, and 20 pM 5' and 3' oligonucleotide primers (Proligos, Paris, France ).<br>
The sequences of the 5' and 3' primer pairs used were the following:<br>

LPS-induced endotoxinemia in mice<br>
After approval by the local ethical committee, male Balb/C mice (20 to 23g) were<br>
randomly grouped and treated with E.coli LPS intraperitoneally (i.p.) in combination with P5 (in<br>
500ul normal saline) or control vector before or after LPS challenge. In some experiments, 5ug<br>
of an anti TREM-1 monoclonal antibody was administered i.p. one hour after LPS injection. The<br>
viability of mice was examined every hour, or ani mals were sacrificed at regular intervals.<br>
Serum samples were collected by cardiac puncture and assayed for TNF-a and IL-1β by ELISA<br>
(BD Biosciences), and for sTREM -1 levels by immunodot.<br>
CLP polymicrobial sepsis model<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
32<br>
Male Balb/C mice (7 to 9 weeks, 20 to 23g) were anaesthetized by i.p. administration of<br>
ketamine and xylazine in 0.2 mL sterile pyrogen -free saline. The caecum was exposed through<br>
a 1.0 cm abdominal midline incision and subjected to a ligation of the distal half followed by two<br>
punctures with a G21 needle. A small amount of stool was expelled from the punctures to<br>
ensure patency. The caecum was replaced into the peritoneal cavity and the abdominal incision<br>
closed in two layers. After surgery all mice were injected s.c. with 0.5 ml of physiologic saline<br>
solution for fluid resuscitation and s.c. every 12 h with 1.25 mg (i.e. 50 µg/g) of imipenem. The<br>
animals were randomly grouped and treated with normal saline (n=14), the control peptide<br>
(n=14, 100µg) or P5 (100µg) in a single injection at HO ( n=18), H+4 (n=18) or H+24 (n=18). The<br>
last group of mice (n=18) was treated with repeated injections of P5 (100ug) at H+4, H+8 and<br>
H+24. All treatments were diluted into 500ul of normal saline and administered i.p. The<br>
inventors next sought to determine th e effect of various doses of P5. For this purpose, mice<br>
(n=15 per group) were treated with a single injection of normal safine or 10ug, 20ug, 50ug<br>
10Oµg or 200ug of P5 at HO after the CLP and monitored for survival. Five additional animals<br>
per group were killed under anaesthesia 24 hours after CLP for the determination of bacterial<br>
count and cytokines levels. Peritoneal lavage fluid was obtained using 2mL RPMI 1640 (Life<br>
Technologies) and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Concentrations of TNF -a and IL-1β<br>
in the serum were determined by ELISA (BD Biosciences). For the assessment of bacterial<br>
counts, blood and peritoneal lavage fluid were plated in serial log dilutions on tryptic soy<br>
supplemented with 5% sheep blood agar pla tes. After plating, tryptic soy agar plates were<br>
incubated at 37°C aerobically for 24 hours, and anaerobically for 48 hours. Results are<br>
expressed as CFU per mL of blood and CFU per mouse for the peritoneal lavage.<br>
Statistical analyses<br>
Serum sTREM-1 and cytokines levels were expressed as mean (±SD).The protection<br>
against LPS lethality by P5 was assessed by comparison of survival curves using the Log -Rank<br>
test. All statistical analyses were completed with Statview software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley<br>
CA) and a two-tailed P
Results<br>
A soluble form of TREM-1 is released from cultured human monocytes after stimulation<br>
with E.coli LPS<br>
To identify the potential release of sTREM-1 in vitro, the Inventors stimulated human<br>
monocytes with LPS and analyzed the conditioned culture medium by SDS-PAGE. LPS<br>
stimulation induced the appearance of a 27 -kDa protein in a time-dependent manner (Figure<br>
7A). Western blotting analysis revealed that this protein was specifically recognized by a<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
33<br>
monoclonal antibody directed against the extra-cellular domain of TREM-1 (Figure 7A). Cell<br>
viability was unaffected at LPS concentrations that induced the presence of sTREM -1 in<br>
conditioned medium, indicating that TREM-1 release was not due to cell death. Similarly,<br>
treatment of monocytes with protease inhibitors did not affect TREM-1 release ( Figure 7A).<br>
TREM-1 mRNA levels were increased upon LPS treatment ( Figure 7B) whereas TREM -1sv<br>
mRNA levels remained undetectable. This suggests that TREM -1 release is likely to be linked to<br>
an increased transcription of the gene and unrelated to TREM-1 sv expression.<br>
Stimulation of monocytes for 16 hours with TNF -a (5 to 100 ng/mL) or IL-1β (5 to 100 ng/mL)<br>
induced very small TREM-1 release in a cytokine dose-dependent manner. Stimulation with<br>
IFN-y did not induce TREM-1 release, even at concentrations of up to 100 U/mL<br>
LPS associated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is attenuated by P5<br>
Significant TNF-a and IL-1β production was observed in the supernatant of monocytes<br>
cultured with LPS. TNF-α and IL-1 β production was even higher for cells cultured with both<br>
TREM-1 mAb and LPS as compared with those cultured with mAb or LPS alone ( Figure 8A).<br>
The inducible release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly lowe r after LPS stimulation<br>
when the medium was supplemented with P5 or IL-10. P5 reduced, in a concentration-<br>
dependent manner, the TNF- α and IL-1 β production from cells cultured with LPS or with LPS<br>
and mAb and simultaneously increased the release of sTREM -1 from cells cultured with LPS.<br>
The control peptide displayed no action on cytokines or sTREM -1 release (data not shown). In<br>
striking contrast, IL-10 totally inhibited the release of both TREM -1 and inflammatory cytokines<br>
(Figure 8A). Both LPS and TREM-1 mAb induced a strong activation of monocytic NF -KB p50<br>
and p65 and combined administration of LPS and TREM-1 mAb lead to a synergistic effect. P5<br>
inhibited the NF-KB activation induced by the engagement of TREM-1 but did not alter the effect<br>
of LPS (Figure 8B).<br>
Serum sTREM-1 levels of LPS-treated mice are increased<br>
In order to determine whether sTREM -1 was released systemically during endotoxemia<br>
in mice, the Inventors measured serum sTREM-1 levels after LPS administration. Serum<br>
sTREM-1 was readily detectable 1 hour after administration of an LD50 dose of LPS and was<br>
maintained at peak plateau levels from 4 to 6 hours after LPS treatment ( Figure 9).<br>
TREM-1 peptide "P5" protects endotoxemic mice from lethality<br>
Mice treated by a single dose of P5 60 min before a lethal dose (LD100) of LPS were<br>
prevented from death in a dose -dependent manner (Figure 10A). In order to investigate whether<br>
P5 treatment could be delayed until after the administration of LPS, the Inventors injected P5<br>
beginning 4 or 6 hours afte r LPS injection. This delayed treatment up to 4 hours conferred<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
34<br>
significant protection against a LD 100 dose of LPS (Figure 10B). No late death occurred over one<br>
week, indicating that P5 did not merely delay the onset of LPS lethality, but provided lasting<br>
protection. Control mice all developed lethargy, piloerection, and diarrhoea before death. By<br>
contrast, P5-treated mice remained well groomed and active, had no diarrhoea, and were lively.<br>
To clarify the mechanism by which P5 protected mice from LPS lethality, the Inventors<br>
determined the serum levels of TNF -α, IL-1β and sTREM-1 of endotoxemic mice at 2 and 4<br>
hours. As compared to controls, pre -treatment by 100 µg of P5 reduced cytokines levels by 30%<br>
and increased sTREM-1 levels by 2 fold as shown in Table 4:<br>

Engagement of TREM-1 is lethal to mice<br>
To further highlight the role of TREM-1 engagement in LPS- mediated mortality, mice<br>
were treated with agonist anti -TREM-1 mAb in combination with the administration of an LD 50<br>
dose of LPS. This induced a significant increase in mortality rate from 50% to 100% ( Figure<br>
10C).<br>
P5 protects mice from CLP-induced lethality<br>
To investigate the role of P5 in a more relevant model of septic shock, the Inventors<br>
performed CLP experiments (Figure 11A). The control groups comprised mice inj ected with<br>
normal saline or with the control peptide. In this model of polymicrobial sepsis, P5 still conferred<br>
a significant protection against lethality even when administered as late as 24 hours after the<br>
onset of sepsis. Interestingly, repeated injections of P5 had the more favourable effect on<br>
survival (P
cytokine production (Table 5). P5 had no effect on bacterial clearance ( Figure 12).<br>

Sepsis exemplifies a complex clinical syndrome that results from a harmful or damaging<br>
host response to severe infection. Sepsis develops when the initial, appropriate host response<br>
to systemic infection becomes amplified, and then dysregulated (4, 5). Neutrophils and<br>
monocyte/macrophages exposed to LPS, for instance, are activated and release such pro-<br>
inflammatory cytokines as TNF-a and IL-1β. Excessive production of these cytokines is widely<br>
believed to contribute to the multi-organ failure that is seen in septic patients (20-23).<br>
TREM-1 is a recently identified molecule involved in monocytic activation and<br>
inflammatory response (12, 14). It belongs to a family related to NK cell receptors that activate<br>
downstream signalling events. The expression of TREM -1 on PNNs and<br>
monocytes/macrophages has been shown to be inducible by LPS (16, 17).<br>
As described herein, the Inventors demonstrate that a soluble form of TREM-1 was<br>
released from cultured human monocytes after stimulation with E.coii LPS. Such a soluble form<br>
was also detectable in the serum of endotoxemic mice as early as 1 hour after LPS challenge.<br>
This is consistent with the implication of TREM -1 in the very early phases of the innate immune<br>
response to infection (14, 15, 24). The mechanism by which sTREM-1 is released is not clearly<br>
elucidated but seems to be related to an increased transcription of the TREM- 1 gene.<br>
Nevertheless, although incubation with a protease inhibitor cocktail does not alter the sTREM-1<br>
release, cleavage of the surface TREM -1 from the membrane cannot be totally excluded.<br>
Interestingly, stimulation of human monocytes with such pro -inflammatory cytokines as TNF-a,<br>
IL-1β or IFN-Y induced very small sTREM-1 release unless LPS was added as a co -stimulus.<br>
The expression of an alternative mRNA TREM -1 splice variant (TREM-1sv) has been detected<br>
in monocytes that might translate into a soluble receptor (18) up on stimulation with cell wall<br>
fraction of Mycobactehum bovis BCG but not LPS (25). This was confirmed in this study as i)<br>
LPS did not increase the level of mRNA TREM-1sv in monocytes and ii) only a 27- kDa protein<br>
was released by monocytes upon LPS stimula tion and not the 17.5-kDa variant.<br>
Although its natural ligand has not been identified (13,14), engagement of TREM-1 on<br>
monocytes with an agonist monoclonal antibody resulted in a further enhancement of pro -<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
36<br>
inflammatory cytokines production, while P5 induced a decrease of these syntheses in a<br>
concentration-dependent manner, and IL -10 completely suppressed it.<br>
Inflammatory cytokines, and especially TNF -a, are considered to be deleterious, yet they<br>
also possess beneficial effects in sepsis (5) as shown by the fatal issue of peritonitis in animals<br>
with impaired TNF-a responses (9-11). Moreover, in clinical trials, the inhibition of TNF-α<br>
increased mortality (8). Finally, the role of TNF- a in the clearance of infection has been<br>
highlighted by the finding that sepsis is a frequent complication in rheumatoid arthritis patients<br>
treated with TNF-a antagonists (26).<br>
The mechanism by which P5 modulates cytokine production is not yet clear. P5<br>
comprises the complementary determining region (CDR)-3 and the lF' |3 strand of the extra -<br>
cellular domain of TREM -1. The latter contains a tyrosine residue mediating dimerization.<br>
Radaev et al postulated that TREM -1 captures its ligand with its CDR- equivalent loop regions<br>
(27). P5 could thus impair TREM-1 dimerization and / or compete with the natural ligand of<br>
TREM-1. Moreover, the increase of sTREM -1 release from monocytes mediated by P5 could<br>
prevent the engagement of membrane TREM-1, sTREM-1 acting as a decoy receptor, as in the<br>
TNF-a system (28, 29).<br>
Activation of the transcription factor NF-KB is a critical step in monocyte inflammatory cytokine<br>
production after exposure to bacterial stimuli such as LPS (30, 31). Among the various NF-KB /<br>
Rel dimers, the p65 / p50 heterodimer is the prototypical form of LPS-inducible NF -KB in<br>
monocytes (32), P5 abolishes the p65 / p50 NF-KB over-activation induced by the engagement<br>
of TREM-1. This might at least partially explain the effects of P5 on cytokine production and the<br>
protection from lethality shown here to occur when the peptide was injected one hour before<br>
LPS-induced septic shock, or even up to 4 hours after.<br>
Endotoxemia is simple to achieve experimentally, but imperfectly suited to reproduce<br>
human sepsis, while polymicrobial sepsis induced by CLP is a more complex but better model,<br>
including the use of fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. The latter was thus also used in this<br>
study, and confirmed the dose-dependent protection provided by P5, even when administered<br>
as late as 24 hours after the onset of sepsis. The favourable effect of P5 was however unrelated<br>
to an enhanced bacterial clearance.<br>
One difficulty in the use of immunomodulatory therapies is that it is not possible to<br>
predict the development of sepsis, and, thus, patients receiving those treatments frequently<br>
already have well-established sepsis (6). Since P5 appeared to be effective even when injected<br>
after the outbreak of sepsi s, it could thus constitute a realistic treatment (24, 33).<br>
By contrast, engagement of TREM-1 by an agonist anti- TREM-1 monoclonal antibody<br>
mediated a dramatic increase of mortality rate in LPS-challenged mice: this further underscores<br>
the detrimental effect of TREM-1 engagement during septic shock.<br><br>

Experimental septic shock reproduces human sepsis only in part. Indeed, our group<br>
recently showed that significant levels of sTREM-1 were released in the serum of critically ill<br>
patients with sepsis patients (34), the highest levels being observed in patients who survived.<br>
This is consistent with our experimental findings indicating that the more important sTREM-1<br>
release, the more favourable is the outcome, and thus sustains, at least theoretically, the<br>
potential value of soluble TREM peptides as post- onset sepsis therapy.<br>
TREM-1 appears to be a crucial player in the immediate immune response triggered by<br>
infection. In the early phase of infection, neutrophils and monocytes initiate the inflammatory<br>
response owing to the engagement of pattern recognition receptors by microbial products β, 4).<br>
At the same time, bacterial products induce the up -regulation and the release of sTREM-1.<br>
Upon recognition of an unknown ligand, TREM -1 activates signalling pathways which amplify<br>
these inflammatory responses, notably in monocytes/macrophages. The modulation of TREM -1<br>
signalling reduces, although without complete inhibition, cytokine production and protects septic<br>
animals from hyper-responsiveness and death. Modulation of TREM-1 engagement with such a<br>
peptide as P5 might be a suitable therapeutic tool for the treatment of sepsis, particularly<br>
because it seems to be active even after the onset of sepsis following infectious aggression.<br>
Example 4: Haemodvnamic studies in LPS treated and septic rats treated with P1 and P5<br>
The role of TREM-1 peptides in further models of septic shock, was investigated by performing<br>
LPS and CLP (caecal ligation and puncture) experiments in rats.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
LPS-induced Endotoxinemia<br>
Animals were randomly grouped (n=10-20) and treated with Escherichia coli LPS (O111:B4,<br>
Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France) i.p. in combination with the TREM -1 or scrambled peptides.<br>
CLP Polymicrobial Sepsis Model<br>
The procedure has been described in details els ewhere {see Mansart, A. et al. Shock 19:38-44<br>
(2003)). Briefly, rats (n=6-10 per group) were anesthetized by i.p. administration of ketamine<br>
(150 mg/kg). The caecum was exposed through a 3.0 -cm abdominal midline incision and<br>
subjected to a ligation of the distal half followed by two punctures with a G21 needle. A small<br>
amount of stool was expelled from the punctures to ensure potency. The caecum was replaced<br>
into the peritoneal cavity and the abdominal incision closed in two layers. After surgery, all rats<br>
were injected s.c. with 50 mL/kg of normal saline solution for fluid resuscitation. TREM-1 or<br>
scrambled peptides were then administered as above.<br><br>

Haemoclvnamic Measurements in rats<br>
Immediately after LPS administration as well as 16 hours after CLP, arterial BP (systolic,<br>
diastolic, and mean), heart rate, abdominal aortic blood flow, and mesenteric blood flow were<br>
recorded using a procedure described elsewhere (see Mansart, A. et al. Shock 19:38-44<br>
(2003)). Briefly, the left carotid artery and the left jugul ar vein were cannulated with PE -50<br>
tubing. Arterial BP was continuously monitored by a pressure transducer and an amplifier-<br>
recorder system (lOX EMKA Technologies, Paris, France). Perivascular probes (Transonic<br>
Systems, Ithaca, NY) wrapped up the upper abd ominal aorta and mesenteric artery, allowed to<br>
monitor their respective flows by means of a flowmeter (Transonic Systems). After the last<br>
measurement (4th hour during LPS experiments and 24th hour after CLP), animals were<br>
sacrificed by an overdose of sodiu m thiopental i.v.<br>
Biological Measurements<br>
Blood was sequentially withdrawn from the left carotid artery. Arterial lactate concentrations and<br>
blood gases analyses were performed on an automatic blood gas analyser (ABL 735,<br>
Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Concentrations of TNF-a and IL-1β in the plasma were<br>
determined by an ELISA test (Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium) according to the recommendations<br>
of the manufacturer. Plasmatic concentrations of nitrates/nitrites were measured using the<br>
Griess reaction (R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK).<br>
Statistical analyses<br>
Results are expressed as mean±SD. Between -group comparisons were performed using<br>
Student' f tests. All statistical analyses were completed with Statview software (Abacus<br>
Concepts, CA) and a two-tailed P
Results<br>
Endotoxinemia model<br>
Following LPS administration, arterial pressures, aortic and mesenteric blood flows<br>
dropped rapidly in control animals (scrambled peptides treated rats) while the heart rate<br>
remained unchanged (Table 6). The decrease of arterial pressures and aortic blood flow was<br>
delayed until the second hour in TREM-1 peptide treated animals with significantly higher values<br>
by that time than in control animals. There was no difference between P1 and P5 treated<br>
groups. By contrast, none of these two peptides had any effect on the decrease of the<br>
mesenteric blood flow (Table 6).<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
39<br>
Arterial pH remained constant over time until the fourth hour after LPS injection where it<br>
severely dropped in the control group only (Table 6). The significant arterial lactate level<br>
elevation present in control animals after the third hour was abolished by the TREM -1 peptides<br>
(Table 6). There was no difference between P1 and P5 with regard to pH, arterial bicarbonate<br>
and lactate concentration s.<br>
As expected, a peak of TNF-a plasmatic concentration was induced by LPS between 30<br>
minutes and 1 hour after injection followed by a progressive decline thereafter ( Figure 13A). P1<br>
peptide injection had no effect on this production, while P5 attenuated TNF-a production by<br>
-30%.<br>
P1 delayed the IL-1β peak until the third hour after LPS injection, but without<br>
attenuation. By contrast, P5 strongly reduced IL-1β release ( Figure 13B).<br>
Nitrite/nitrate concentrations increased rapidly after LPS administration in con trol and P1<br>
treated animals but remained stable upon P5 treatment ( Figure 14).<br><br>

CLP Model<br>
As the severity of the Inventors' model was at its highest 16 to 20 hours after the<br>
completion of the CLP, the Inventors chose to investigate animals by the 16th hour. Importantly,<br>
there were no deaths before this time point. Although all animals were fluid resuscitated, none<br>
received antibiotics in order to strictly consider the role of the peptides.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
 41<br>
There was a dramatic decline in arterial pre ssure in the control animals over time, and<br>
by H24 systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were 58±7 mmHg, 25±4 mmHg and 38±2<br>
mmHg respectively. This decrease was almost totally abolished with P1 or P5 treatment with no<br>
significant difference between H16 and H24 (Figure 15). There was no difference between P1<br>
and P5 treated rats.<br>
TREM-1 peptides also prevented the aortic and mesenteric blood flows decrease<br>
observed in control animals (Table 7). The protective effect on mesenteric blood flow alterations<br>
was even higher under P5 treatment. The relative preservation of blood flows was not related to<br>
an increased heart rate, since the latter was rather slower than in control animals (Table 7 ).<br>
The progressive metabolic acidosis that developed in control rats was attenuated by the<br>
P1 peptide, and almost abrogated by P5. The same protective trend was observed for arterial<br>
lactate elevation with a more pronounced effect of P5 (Table 7 ).<br>
Table 7. Hemodynamic and selected biochemical parameters during CLP polymicrobial sepsis<br><br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>
42<br>
Both P1 and P5 induced a decrease in TNF- a production, again with a stronger effect of<br>
P5. By H20, plasmatic TNF-α was almost undetectable under P5 treatment whereas it remained<br>
elevated in the other groups of animals ( Figure 16).<br>
Nitrite/nitrate concentrations were increased in control animals but remained at a low<br>
level in both TREM-1 peptides treated groups (Figure 17).<br>
A protective action of both P5 and P1 on hemodynamics was thus observed in septic<br>
rats. Both arterial pressure and blood flows were preserved, independently of heart rate.<br>
Moreover, modulation of TREM -1 signalling reduced, although not completely, cytokine<br>
production and protected septic animals from hyper-responsiveness. The fact that the cytokine<br>
production was not totally inhibited is a crucial point. Indeed, although inflammatory cytokines<br>
such as TNF-a are considered deleterious, they also display beneficial effects in sepsis as<br>
underlined by the fatal issue of peritonitis models in animals with impaired TNF-a responses.<br>
The activation of iNOS observed during septic shock leads to the production of large<br>
amount of NO that partly explains some of the peripheral vascular disorders (notably<br>
vasodilation and hypotension). On the myocardium itself, most of the action of NO is mediated<br>
by an activation of the soluble guanylate-cyclase responsible for the production of cGMP which<br>
impairs the effect of cytosolic calcium on contraction. Cyclic GMP is also able to stimulate the<br>
activity of some phosphodiesterases. The subsequent decrease of intra -cellular cAMP levels<br>
could explain the ability of NO to attenuate the effects of beta adrenergic stimulation. The<br>
preservation of arterial pressure could therefore be partly explained by a lessened production of<br>
NO, as reflected by the lower concentrations of plasma nitrite/nitrate in TREM-1 peptides<br>
treated animals.<br>
The decrease in inflammatory cytokine production could partly explain the effect noted<br>
on blood flows. Indeed, although the list of potential cytokine mediators of myocardial<br>
depression is long, TNF-a and IL-1p have been shown to be good candidates Both these latter<br>
cytokines depressed myocardial contractility in vitro or ex vivo. Moreover, the neutralization or<br>
removal of TNF-a or IL-1β from human septic serum partly abrogates the myocardial<br>
depressant effect in vitro and in vivo. Although P1 and P5 had an identical action on blood flows<br>
and arterial pressure during endotoxinemia, their action on cytokine production differed with only<br>
a slight effect of P1 on plasma TNF-a and IL-1β concentrations. The protective role of the<br>
TREM-1 peptides could therefore be only partly related to their action on cytokine release, or<br>
involve redundant pathways.<br>
The modulation of the TREM-1 pathway by the use of small synthetic peptides had<br>
beneficial effects on haemodynamic parameters during experimental septic shock in rats, along<br>
with an attenuation of inflammatory cytokine production.<br><br>
BXL-P037/PCT<br>

In summary, these data show that the TREM-1 peptides of the invention 1) efficiently<br>
protect subject animals from sepsis -related hemodynamic deterioration; 2) attenuate the<br>
development of lactic acidosis; 3) modulate the production of such pro-inflammatory cytokines<br>
as TNF-a and IL-1β and 4) decrease the generation of nitric oxide. Thus TREM-1 peptides are<br>
potentially useful in the restoration of haemodynamic parameters in patients with sepsis, septic<br>
shock or sepsis-like conditions and therefore constitute a potential treatment for the aforesaid<br>
conditions.<br>
