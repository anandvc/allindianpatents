SELF-CLIMBING FORMWQRK AND/OR SELF-CLIMBING SCAFFOLD UNIT<br>
WITH A CLIMBING CYLINDER<br>
The invention relates to a self-climbing formwork and/or a<br>
self-climbing scaffold unit with a climbing cylinder which<br>
is provided for raising or lowering a formwork and/or a<br>
scaffold unit along a wall of a building.<br>
Self-climbing formworks are known wherein the lift<br>
cylinders are affixed to climbing rails which run along a<br>
wall during a climbing process.<br>
DE 21 54 188 Al discloses and describes a device for<br>
concreting pillars. A pillar is concreted in a formwork<br>
which is surrounded by scaffolding. The formwork is moved<br>
along the individual pillar sections by means of a climbing<br>
cylinder. At its lower end the climbing cylinder is fixed<br>
by means of a pressure plate on a pillar section which has<br>
already hardened. At its upper end the climbing cylinder is<br>
provided with two opposed pressure ribs which are pivotally<br>
mounted and in this way can be moved past cross members of<br>
the scaffolding. During a lifting movement of the climbing<br>
cylinder, the pivoted-out pressure ribs engage in recesses<br>
on the scaffolding and abut against the cross members of<br>
the scaffolding.<br>
It is the object of the invention to construct a climbing<br>
cylinder on a self-climbing formwork or on a self-climbing<br>
scaffold unit in such a manner that it can be used and also<br>
shifted more easily.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by the<br>
features of claim 1.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Commercially available lift cylinders which operate and are<br>
embodied for example as hydraulically operating lift<br>
cylinders can be used as climbing cylinders. The lift<br>
cylinders only need to be adapted to the invention at their<br>
respective free ends whereby at one end, a fixing<br>
connection is provided at one fixed anchor point of the<br>
wall and at the other end, a movable support is provided at<br>
the free end of the piston of the lift cylinder, which can<br>
engage in bearing bolts of the climbing rails at any points<br>
of the climbing rails. The climbing rails can carry<br>
formwork, platforms and any other bracing which can be<br>
raised or lowered with the climbing rails by means of the<br>
climbing cylinder or cylinders. The climbing rails can also<br>
be integrated in a frame unit which can receive and carry<br>
formwork in addition to other units. When a lowering or<br>
raising process has been completed by means of the climbing<br>
cylinder or cylinders, the climbing cylinder or cylinders<br>
can be Shifted to other anchor points for a new movement<br>
process of the climbing rails.<br>
The climbing cylinder or cylinders are placed at locating<br>
points formed on the climbing shoe or shoes. Consequently,<br>
always the same fastening points on the climbing shoe or<br>
shoes and the climbing cylinder or cylinders are used for<br>
holding the climbing cylinder or cylinders on the climbing<br>
shoe or shoes. The climbing system can thus have a simple<br>
structure and any scope for incorrect connection for a<br>
fixed mounting of the climbing cylinder is eliminated. When<br>
the climbing cylinders are placed on the climbing shoes,<br>
the climbing cylinder or cylinders are supported on the<br>
climbing shoe or shoes during a lifting process.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the climbing<br>
cylinder or cylinders are affixed to a climbing shoe or<br>
shoes which are attached to the wall in a fixed position.<br>
This has the advantage that the climbing cylinder or<br>
cylinders can always be attached at the same fixing points<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
of climbing shoes which are fixed to the wall at the anchor<br>
points provided. An anchor point thus bears the climbing<br>
shoe which guides the climbing rails along the wall at a<br>
defined distance and can at the same time hold the climbing<br>
rail permanently in one position. The climbing cylinder<br>
uses the climbing shoe as a fixed bearing and the climbing<br>
cylinder can raise or lower the climbing rail by means of a<br>
piston stroke.<br>
In a further embodiment, the climbing cylinder or cylinders<br>
are pivotally hinged at the fixed fixing, namely the anchor<br>
point or the climbing shoe. This has the advantage that<br>
when the piston is withdrawn into the housing of the<br>
climbing cylinder, the climbing cylinder can be pivoted out<br>
of engagement with the bearing bolts of the climbing rail,<br>
whereby when the piston retracts into the housing of the<br>
climbing cylinder, a bearing bolt impinging upon the catch<br>
'of the climbing cylinder pivots the1 climbing cylinder to<br>
such an extent that the piston can be retracted into the<br>
housing of the climbing cylinder without any interference.<br>
If, in this connection, the climbing cylinder is fixed in a<br>
spring-mounted manner at the anchor point and/or the<br>
climbing shoe, it can automatically pivot back into its<br>
initial position as soon as the free end of the climbing<br>
cylinder is no longer in contact with a bearing bolt.<br>
The pivotal support of the climbing cylinder at the free<br>
end is advantageously embodied as a catch, as already<br>
stated, which can be brought into engagement with a bearing<br>
bolt of the climbing rail in a particularly simple manner.<br>
It is likewise simple to release the bearing connection<br>
between the catch and the bearing bolt by retracting the<br>
piston into the housing of the climbing cylinder. The catch<br>
is pivotally hinged to the piston and at the same time, at<br>
the support, in this case the catch, a mounting plate is<br>
provided as a counterbearing for abutment against the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
respective climbing rail. This has the advantage that no<br>
moments from the bearing load of the climbing rail are<br>
introduced into the piston rod when the climbing cylinder<br>
raises or lowers a climbing rail.<br>
It is understood that the spacing of the bearing bolts at<br>
the climbing rail or rails is matched to the possible<br>
piston stroke of a climbing cylinder. The piston path of a<br>
climbing cylinder is always longer than the spacing of<br>
adjacent bearing bolts on a climbing rail. A climbing<br>
cylinder must always be able to retract its piston rod with<br>
the catch hinged thereon to such an extent that the catch<br>
can automatically pivot into a position in which the catch<br>
can reliably grasp below a bearing bolt of the climbing<br>
rail. When a climbing process has been completed, the<br>
climbing cylinder or cylinders are moved to adjacent anchor<br>
points or climbing shoes so that another climbing process<br>
can be carried out after another concreting section has<br>
been completed. The climbing cylinder can be moved together<br>
with hydraulic hoses connected to the climbing cylinders or<br>
the climbing cylinders are uncoupled from the hydraulic<br>
hoses by means of quick connectors for the process of<br>
shifting to other fixed mounting points. After the climbing<br>
cylinder has been replaced, the hydraulic connection<br>
between the climbing cylinder and a hydraulic unit is made<br>
again.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment the following figures show a<br>
section of a wall on which a climbing cylinder is fixed<br>
which holds a rail to which various attachments can be<br>
fixed.<br>
It is understood that the bearing bolts of the climbing<br>
rails can also be replaced by technically equivalent means.<br>
Thus, matched catches or supports of a sliding shoe can<br>
also engage in through openings on the climbing rails or<br>
projections can be constructed on the climbing rails which<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
can be gripped or grasped from below by corresponding<br>
supports of the sliding shoe.<br>
In the figures:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a climbing cylinder of a self-climbing<br>
formwork according to the invention in side view on a wall<br>
consisting of a first and a second concreting section;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a further side view to Fig. 1 with the<br>
climbing cylinder according to the invention in the<br>
extended state; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a side view with a climbing cylinder according<br>
to the invention showing how this pivots on the fixed<br>
mounting when the piston retracts.<br>
The figures in the drawings show the climbing cylinder<br>
according to the invention and the associated parts highly<br>
schematically so that the structure and the operating mode<br>
of the climbing cylinder can be clearly shown.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a climbing cylinder 10 in the retracted<br>
state as attached to a wall 12 of a building. The figure<br>
shows sections of a first concreting section 14 and a<br>
second concreting section 16. A climbing shoe 18 is fixed<br>
on an anchor point on the first concreting section 14 in a<br>
fixed position. The climbing shoe 18 guides and holds a<br>
climbing rail 22 in position by means of a catch 20. At<br>
points of the first and/or the second concreting section<br>
14, 16 not shown there is provided at least one further<br>
climbing shoe which together with the climbing shoe 18<br>
shown holds the climbing rail 22 guided on the wall 12.<br>
The catch 20 of the climbing shoe 18 can grasp under the<br>
bearing bolts 24, 24', 24", 24'" according to the position<br>
of the climbing rail *22. In the position shown in the *<br>
figure the catch 20 grasps under the bolt 24' so that the<br>
climbing rail 22 is held against its gravitational force on<br>
the wall 12 so that it cannot be displaced.<br>
The climbing cylinder 10 has a housing 26 in which a piston<br>
28 is guided so that it can be displaced hydraulically.<br>
Hinged at the free end of the piston 28 is a catch 30 on<br>
which a mounting plate 32 is provided. The catch 30 has an<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
opening suitable for receiving a bearing bolt 24 to 24"'.<br>
In the retracted state of the piston 28 the catch 30 is<br>
located so far under the bearing bolts 24 to 24"' that it<br>
can be pivoted without any interference into a position<br>
suitable for grasping below a bearing bolt 24 to 24"'.<br>
The climbing shoe 18 is constructed in two parts as a wall<br>
shoe 34 and sliding shoe 36. The wall shoe 34 is fixed in<br>
position at an anchor point of the wall 12 and the sliding<br>
shoe 36 is fixed in a hinged manner on the wall shoe 34.<br>
The catch 20 is pivotally mounted in the sliding shoe 36<br>
such that it locks in the position shown in the figure and<br>
if a pressure is exerted on the opposite side of the catch<br>
which has a sloping section, the catch 20 can pivot so far<br>
into the housing of the sliding shoe 36 that it is no<br>
longer in engagement with the bearing bolts 24 to 24"'.<br>
The climbing cylinder 10 has a housing 37 by which means<br>
the climbing cylinder 10 can be placed on an articulated<br>
shaft 38 of the sliding shoe 36. When the climbing cylinder<br>
10 is placed on the articulated shaft 38 by means of the<br>
housing 37, a safety bolt 40 secures the articulated<br>
connection and the climbing cylinder 10 can only be removed<br>
from the articulated shaft 38 by unlocking the safety bolt<br>
40, and withdrawing it. The climbing cylinder 10 can be<br>
pivoted about the articulated shaft 38 when it is placed<br>
thereon. Between a mounting plate of the sliding shoe 36<br>
and the housing 37 there is provided on the housing 37 a<br>
rubber or toughened element 41 which presses the climbing<br>
cylinder 10 into the position shown in the figure. If the<br>
piston 28 of the hydraulically operated climbing cylinder<br>
is extended, the catch 30 grasps under the bearing bolt<br>
24"' and during a further extension of the piston 28, the<br>
climbing rail 22 is raised.<br>
Figure 2 shows the climbing cylinder 10 in a fully extended<br>
position. The piston 28 is fully extended from the housing<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
26 and the climbing rail 22 has been raised by means of the<br>
climbing cylinder 10 in the direction of the arrow 42. The<br>
entire load of the climbing rail 22 and the associated<br>
attachments of the climbing rail 22 rest on the catch or<br>
catches 30 of the climbing cylinder 10. In the position<br>
shown in the figure, the catch 20 of the climbing shoe 18<br>
is out of engagement with the bearing bolt 24 which during<br>
raising of the climbing rail 22 in the direction of the<br>
arrow 42, has temporarily pressed the catch 20 into the<br>
climbing shoe 18 so that the lift process could be carried<br>
out in the direction of the arrow 42 without hindrance.<br>
Compared with the position of the climbing rail 22 in Fig.<br>
1, the climbing rail 22 in Fig. 2 has been raised by a path<br>
length whose length is determined by the distance of the<br>
catch 20 from the bearing bolt 24'. During the lifting<br>
process the climbing -cylinder 10 is supported on the ♦<br>
articulated shaft 38 of the climbing shoe 18. By abutting<br>
against the climbing rail 22 so as to restrict the pivot<br>
path, the mounting plate 32 prevents the catch 30 from<br>
being able to pivot further under load and prevents any<br>
moments from being introduced into the piston 28 of the<br>
climbing cylinder 10 under the bearing load of the catch 30<br>
by the climbing rail 22. The mounting plate 32 thus has the<br>
function of a counterbearing. By means of the lifting<br>
movement shown in Fig. 2, the climbing rail 22 climbs along<br>
the concreting sections 14, 16 in the direction of the<br>
arrow 42 and if the piston 28 is now retracted slightly,<br>
the bearing bolt 24 rests on the catch 20 and the climbing<br>
shoe 18 now bears the entire load of the climbing rail 22<br>
by means of the catch 30. The catch 30 of the climbing<br>
cylinder 10 is then relieved of weight.<br>
Figure 3 shows the climbing cylinder 10 in the non-fully-<br>
retracted state. The piston 28 is not fully retracted into<br>
the housing 26. If the climbing cylinder 10 is now<br>
retracted further compared with the state of movement of<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
the climbing cylinder 10 in Fig. 2, the catch 30 impinges<br>
upon its lower side, which is constructed as sloping,<br>
against the bearing bolt 24". If the piston 28 is retracted<br>
further into the housing 26, the bearing bolt 24", being<br>
held at its distance from the wall 12 by means of the<br>
spaced climbing shoe 18 so that it cannot be displaced on<br>
the climbing rail 22, presses the climbing cylinder 10 out<br>
of its alignment shown in Figs. 1 and 2 into a pivoted<br>
position as shown in Fig. 3. The climbing cylinder 10<br>
pivots about the articulated shaft 38 so far in the<br>
direction of the wall 12 that it can completely bypass a<br>
bearing bolt, in this case the bearing bolt 24". When the<br>
climbing cylinder 10 is pivoted, the climbing cylinder 10<br>
is pivoted from its aligned position against a spring force<br>
produced by the rubber or toughened element 41 and if the<br>
catch 30 is free from any hindrance such as the bearing<br>
bolt 24", as result of the. spring force of the rubber or<br>
toughened element 41, the climbing cylinder 10 pivots back<br>
into its position free from spring loading, as shown in<br>
Figs. 1 and 2. It is shown in Fig. 3 how the safety bolt 40<br>
secures the hinge around the articulated shaft 38 so that<br>
the housing 37 is securely held on the articulated shaft<br>
38. The piston 28 can be retracted so far into the housing<br>
2 6 that the catch 30 is automatically brought back into a<br>
position which can receive the bearing bolt 24" (a<br>
comparable position of the catch 30 as in Fig. 1) . The<br>
catch 30 then comes into engagement with the bearing bolt<br>
24" if the piston 28 is withdrawn slightly from the housing<br>
26.<br>
The spacings of the bearing bolts on the climbing rail 22<br>
are matched to the piston stroke length of the climbing<br>
cylinder 10 so that the desired climbing strokes can be<br>
carried out. The climbing rail 22 also has other through<br>
openings which can be used for fixing bracings, platforms<br>
and formwork. The climbing rail itself is shown cut in the<br>
figures. The figures only show half of the climbing rail<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
used here which is composed of two U-profiles and joined<br>
together at a distance by means of bearing bolts.<br>
A climbing cylinder 10 of self-climbing formwork in the<br>
building area is provided such that it can move climbing<br>
rails 22 along a wall 12. At one end the climbing cylinder<br>
10 has a fixing for an anchor point of the wall and at the<br>
other end a catch 30 is provided on the climbing cylinder,<br>
which can be brought into engagement with the climbing rail<br>
such that it bears the climbing rail 10 on the one hand and<br>
can displace it on the other hand. The climbing cylinder 10<br>
can be fixed at an anchor point of the building or on a<br>
climbing shoe 18.<br><br>
