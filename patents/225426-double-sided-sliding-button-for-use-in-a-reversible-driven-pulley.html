				<td>DOUBLE-SIDED SLIDING BUTTON FOR USE IN A REVERSIBLE DRIVEN PULLEY<br>
Continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) are commonly used on a wide range of vehicles, such as<br>
small cars or trucks, snowmobiles, golf carts, scooters, etc. They typically comprise a driving pulley<br>
mechanically connected to a motor, a driven pulley mechanically connected to wheels or a track,<br>
possibly through another mechanical device such as a gear box, and a trapezoidal drivebelt<br>
transmitting torque between the driving pulley and the driven pulley. A CVT automatically changes<br>
the ratio as required by load and speed conditions, providing an increased torque under high load and<br>
speed conditions, providing an increased torque under high loads at low speeds and yet controlling<br>
the rotation speed of the motor as the vehicle accelerates. A CVT may be used with all kinds of<br>
motors, such as internal combustion engines or electric motors.<br>
The sides of the drivebelt are, on each pulley, gripped between two opposite sheaves that are<br>
coaxially mounted around a corresponding main shaft. Generally, in each pulley of a conventional<br>
CVT, one sheave, usually called "fixed sheave", is rigidly connected to one end of the corresponding<br>
main shaft. The other sheave, usually called "movable sheave", is free to slide and / or rotate with<br>
reference to the fixed sheave since it is mounted on bushings or the like.<br>
At a low vehicle speed, the winding diameter of the drivebelt at the driving pulley is minimal and the<br>
winding diameter at the driven pulley is maximum. This is referred to as the minimum ratio since<br>
there is the minimum number of rotations or fraction of rotation of the driven pulley for each full<br>
rotation of the driven pulley.<br>
Generally, when the rotation speed of the driving pulley increases, its movable sheave moves closer<br>
to the fixed sheave thereof under the effect of a centrifugal mechanism. This forces the drivebelt to<br>
wind on a larger diameter on the driving pulley and, consequently, on a smaller diameter on the<br>
driven pulley. The drivebelt then exerts a radial force on the sheaves of the driven pulley in addition<br>
to the tangential driving force by which the torque is transmitted. This radial force<br>
urges the movable sheave of the driven pulley away from the fixed sheave thereof.<br>
It is counterbalanced in part by a return force, which is typically generated by a<br>
spring inside the driven pulley or another biasing mechanism. It is also<br>
counterbalanced by a force generated by the axial reaction of the torque applied<br>
by the drivebelt on the driven pulley. This is caused by a cam system that tends to<br>
move the movable sheave towards the fixed sheave as the torque increases. The<br>
cam system typically comprises a cam plate having a plurality of symmetrically-<br>
disposed and inclined ramps on which respective cam followers are engaged. The<br>
followers are usually sliding buttons or rollers. The set of ramps or the set of<br>
followers is mounted on the movable sheave and the other is directly or indirectly<br>
connected to the main shaft in a rigid manner. The closing effect of the cam<br>
system on the drivebelt tension is then somewhat proportional to output torque.<br>
Generally, at the maximum vehicle speed, the ratio is maximum as there is the<br>
maximum number of rotations or fraction of rotation of the driven pulley for each<br>
full rotation of the driving pulley. Then, when the vehicle speed decreases, the<br>
rotation speed of the driving pulley typically decreases as well since the rotation<br>
speed of the motor decreases. This causes, at some point, a decrease of the<br>
winding diameter of the driving pulley and a decrease of the radial force exerted by<br>
the drivebelt on the sides of the sheaves at the driven pulley. Ultimately, the<br>
driven pulley is allowed to have a larger winding diameter as the spring or another<br>
biasing mechanism moves the movable sheave towards the fixed sheave.<br>
Some CVTs are provided with reversible driven pulleys. A reversible driven pulley<br>
operates in a similar fashion than that of a unidirectional one, with the exception<br>
that the transmission ratio can be controlled during motor braking or when the<br>
vehicle is traveling in reverse. For instance, during motor braking, the torque is no<br>
longer coming from the motor to the wheels or track, but in the opposite direction.<br>
Similarly, when accelerating in reverse, the torque and the rotation will be in the<br>
reverse direction, the torque being transmitted from the motor to the wheels or<br>
track. A reversible driven pulley generally comprises a second set of ramps and a<br>
second set of followers. In use, one set of followers and its corresponding set of<br>
ramps are used when the torque is in one direction, the other set being used<br>
for the other direction.<br>
U.S. patent No. 6,413,178, issued on 2 July 2002 to Rene CHAMBERLAND,<br>
discloses a reversible driven pulley having cam followers disposed side-by-<br>
side and aligned in a radial plane of the pulley. The cam followers are<br>
mounted on a radial support.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, reversible driven pulleys must have two<br>
sets of followers, one being required for each set of ramps. Each of these<br>
followers must be secured at a corresponding location in the driven pulley.<br>
The attachment of the followers is particularly important since they are<br>
subjected to very important stresses when the driven pulleys are in<br>
operation. When the followers are sliding buttons, one must be able to<br>
easily remove them and replace them with new ones since they usually wear<br>
over time. There was thus a need to provide a sliding button having a new<br>
configuration and design which is more convenient and efficient than the<br>
conventional ones, particularly for reversible driven pulleys where the<br>
number of sliding buttons is important.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a double-sided sliding button for use in a<br>
reversible driven pulley. The sliding button comprises two spaced-apart<br>
sliding button halves which are configured and disposed with reference to a<br>
curved medial axis substantially inscribed in a radial plane of the pulley.<br>
Each half has a front side, provided with a contact surface, and a rear side.<br>
Both contact surfaces are mutually opposite and both sides of each half<br>
intersect the curved medial axis. A bridge member allows to rigidly connect<br>
the rear side of the two halves. With this configuration, each sliding button<br>
can be easily installed and secured in a clamp attached to a part of driven<br>
pulley. Each sliding button is also capable of working in both directions,<br>
thereby reducing the number of individual sliding buttons to install by 50%.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a double-sided sliding button for use in a<br>
reversible driven pulley, the sliding button comprising : two spaced-apart sliding button halves<br>
configured and disposed with reference to a curved medial axis, each half having a front side,<br>
provided with a contact surface, a rear side and a bottom side, both contact surfaces being mutually<br>
opposite and both front sides intersecting the curved medial axis; and a bridge member rigidly<br>
connected to the rear side of the two halves.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described in or apparent from the<br>

FIGS. 1 to 9 show a double-sided sliding button (10) in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. The double-sided sliding button<br>
(10) is shown with the preferred embodiment for a corresponding clamp (100)<br>
used to attach the sliding button (10). These parts are to be installed in a<br>
reversible driven pulley. Like the other components of a driven pulley, the sliding<br>
button (10) and the clamp (100) are configured and disposed to be symmetrical<br>
with reference to the rotation axis of the driven pulley. This also allows the driven<br>
pulley to remain balanced when rotating.<br>
The sliding button (10) is constructed with reference to a curved medial axis (M).<br>
The center of the curved medial axis (M) is preferably the rotation axis of the<br>
driven pulley. The driven pulley has one sheave which is able to slide and rotate<br>
with reference to the other sheave. The sliding buttons (10) are then mounted on<br>
one of these sheaves. Corresponding ramps (200) are mounted on the other<br>
sheave. The ramps (200) are curved as well.<br>
As can be seen, the sliding button (10) comprises two spaced-apart sliding button<br>
halves (20). Each half (20) is in fact a sliding button corresponding to one of the<br>
ramps (200). Both halves (20) are not necessarily identical since they are used in<br>
different contexts. For instance, when the vehicle travels in reverse, the response<br>
of the driven pulley do not need to be the same compared to when the vehicle<br>
travels in a forward direction. The shape of the ramps (200) of each set also<br>
changes as well.<br>
Each half (20) has a front side (22), a rear side (24) and a bottom side (25). The<br>
front side (22) is provided with a contact surface (26), which contact surface (26) is<br>
shaped in accordance with the design requirement and to maintain a good contact<br>
with the corresponding ramp (200). Examples of ramps (200) are shown in<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9. The contact surface (26) defines a three-dimensional curve, or<br>
helix, which is matched by an opposite curve on the surface of a corresponding<br>
ramp (200). As best shown in FIG. 2, both contact surfaces (26) of the sliding<br>
button (10) are mutually opposite and both front sides (22) intersect the curved<br>
medial axis (M).<br>
A bridge member (30) is used to maintain together the two sliding button halves<br>
(20). This bridge member (30) is rigidly connected to the rear side (24) of the two<br>
sliding button halves (20). The bridge member (30) is preferably aligned with the<br>
curved medial axis (M), although it could also be located elsewhere, for instance<br>
closer to an edge of the sliding button halves (20). It also preferably comprises a<br>
sleeve portion (32) having a center axis extending substantially parallel to the rear<br>
side (24) of the sliding button halves (20).<br>
Preferably, each half (20) further comprises a flange (28) projecting from the<br>
bottom side (25). These flanges (28) allow to tightly secure the sliding button (10)<br>
in place. Each flange (28) is adjacent to the rear side (24) of the corresponding<br>
half (20) and extend parallel thereto. The purpose of these flanges (28) will be<br>
explained hereafter.<br>
The clamp (100) used to hold the sliding button (10) is preferably T- shaped, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Other configurations can be used as well. The clamp (100) is<br>
generally curved and aligned with the curved medial axis (M). It comprises a<br>
central section (110) and two opposite side sections (120). The central section<br>
(110) and the side sections (120) are preferably separated by radial slots (130).<br>
The central section (110) of each clamp (100) comprises opposite and spaced-<br>
apart flanges (112). The two flanges (112) define between them a slot (114)<br>
between which the bridge member (30) of the sliding button (10) will be inserted.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 5, a threaded bore (116) is provided in the central<br>
section (110) in order to receive the free end of a screw (140) designed to secure<br>
the sliding button (10) in place. It should be noted that the screw (140) can be<br>
replaced by any other equivalent connector.<br>
The design of the parts is such that the sliding button (10) should fit snugly and<br>
tightly into the clamp (100), as shown in FIG. 4. This insures that the forces are<br>
properly balanced and that the sliding button (10) remains in place. The projecting<br>
flanges (28) of the sliding button (10) then extend into the radial slots (130) of the<br>
clamp (100) with an interfering engagement. The flanges (28) preferably comprise<br>
a plurality of bosses which allow to facilitate the insertion of the flanges (28) in<br>
their respective radial slot (130).<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 show the forces involved when the sliding button which is installed<br>
in the clamp (100). As can be seen, the sides of the central section (110) are<br>
preferably slightly inclined and define between them an angle 9i. Since the rear<br>
sides (24) of the halves (20) are parallel, the insertion of the sliding button (10) into<br>
the clamp (100) induces pressing forces on the sides of the central section (110).<br>
These forces are referred to as F-, and F2 in FIG. 6. These forces are also shown<br>
in FIG. 7. It should be noted that the design should not be such that the sliding<br>
button (10) will have a tendency to come out of the clamp (100) by itself.<br>
Nevertheless, the screw (140) (shown in FIG. 7) produces a force F3 which<br>
maintains the sliding button (10) in place.<br>
As can also be seen in FIG. 6, the two flanges (28), located in the radial slots<br>
(130), are designed to apply two opposite forces, referred to as F4 and F5. These<br>
forces allow to maintain the bottom side (25) of each half (20) against the side<br>
sections (120). Forces F6 and F7 are then applied by the bottom sides (25). All<br>
this prevents the half (20) to be lifted from the corresponding side section (120)<br>
when the contact surface (26) of the opposite half (20) is engaged against a<br>
corresponding ramp (200).<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 7, the sides of the flanges (112) of the central section<br>
(110) are separated by an angle 92 which is slightly greater than the distance<br>
between the two halves (20). This creates forces Fs and Fq which press the inner<br>
side of the sliding button (10) against the structure to which the clamp (100) is<br>
attached. Such structure can also be seen in FIG. 5. This also promotes stability<br>
of the sliding button (10) when it is in use. Among other things, it prevents the<br>
inner side of each half (20) from detaching from the adjacent wall under the effect<br>
of the elastic forces F10 and F-h created by the slight stretching of the bridge (30).<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 schematically show how the sliding button (10) can move while it is<br>
in use. During normal use, the contact surface (26) of one sliding button half (20)<br>
is in engagement with the corresponding ramp (200). When the direction of the<br>
torque changes to the point that this can no longer be compensated by the spring<br>
of the driven pulley, the sliding button (10) changes position and is moved towards<br>
the opposite ramp (200). This transition period is usually very short. If desired, a<br>
damping element (not shown) can be provided between the sliding button (10) and<br>
the clamp (100) in order to decrease the shocks caused when the sliding button<br>
(10) hits the opposite ramp (200).<br>
As can be appreciated, the double-sided sliding button (10) has many advantages<br>
compared to single sliding buttons for reversible driven pulleys. Among other<br>
things, the double-sided sliding button (10) can be easily installed and secured in a<br>
clamp attached to a part of the driven pulley The number of individual sliding<br>
buttons is also reduced by 50%.<br>
