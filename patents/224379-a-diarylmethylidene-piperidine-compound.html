				<td>PIARYLMETHYLIDENE PIPERTOINE DERIVATIVES, PREPARATIONS THEREOF AND USES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel compounds, processes for their preparation, their use and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds. The novel compounds are useful in therapy, and in particular for the treatment of pain, anxiety and functional gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The receptor has been identified as having a role in many bodily functions such as circulatory and pain systems. Ligands for the 6 receptor may therefore find potential use as analgesics, and/or as antihypertensive agents. Ligands for the 6 receptor have also been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
The identification of at least three different populations of opioid receptors (jj,, 8 and K) is now well established and all three are apparent in bom central and peripheral nervous systems of many species including man. Analgesia has been observed in various animal models when one or more of these receptors has been activated.<br>
With few exceptions, currently available selective opioid 5 ligands are peptidic in nature and are unsuitable for administration by systemic routes. One example of a aon-peptidic S-agonist is SNC80 (Bilsky E.J. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 273(1), pp. 359-366 (1995)).<br>
Many d agonist compounds that have been identified in the prior art have many disadvantages in that they suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and are not analgesic when administered by systemic routes. Also, it has been documented that many of these 6 agonist compounds show significant convulsive effects when administered systemically.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,187,792 to Delorme et al. describes some 6-agonists. However, there is still a need for improved 8-agonists.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
The compounds of the invention are found to be active towards 5 receptors in warm-blooded animal, e.g., human. Particularly the compounds of the invention are found to be effective 5 receptor ligands. In vitro assays, infra, demonstrate these surprising activities, especially with regard to agonists potency and efficacy as demonstrated in the rat brain functional assay and/or the human 6 receptor functional assay (low). This feature may be related to in vivo activity and may not be linearly correlated with binding affinity. In these in vitro assays, a compound is tested for their activity toward 8 receptors and ICso is obtained to determine the selective activity for a particular compound towards 6 receptors. In the current context, ICso generally refers to the concentration of the compound at which 50% displacement of a standard radioactive 6 receptor ligand has been observed.<br>
The activities of the compound towards K and /i receptors are also measured in a similar assay.<br>
hi vitro model<br>
Cell culture<br>
Human 293S cells expressing cloned human K, 8 and /i receptors and neomycin resistance are grown in suspension at 37°C and 5% CO2 in shaker flasks containing calcium-free DMEM10% FBS, 5% BCS, 0.1% Pluronic F-68, .and 600 |ig/ml geneticin.<br>
Rat brains are weighed and rinsed in ice-cold PBS (containing 2.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The brains are homogenized with a polytron for 30 sec (rat) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5mM EDTA, with phenyimethylsulfonyl fluoride added just prior use to O.SMmM from a 0.5M stock in DMSO:ethanol).<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells are pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5 mM EDTA, with PMSF added just prior to use to 0.1 mM from a 0.1 M stock in ethanol), incubated on ice for 15 min, then homogenized with a polytron for 30 sec. The suspension is spun at lOOOg (max) for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant is saved on ice and the pellets resuspended and spun as before. The supematants from both spins are combined and spun at 46,000 g(max) for 30 min. The pellets are resuspended in cold Tris buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.0) and spun again. The final pellets are resuspended in membrane buffer ( 50 mM Tris, 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.0). Aliquots (1 ml) in polypropylene tubes are frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at -70°C until use. The protein concentrations are determined by a modified Lowry assay with sodium dodecyl sulfate.<br>
Binding assays<br>
Membranes are thawed at 37°C, cooled on ice, (or kept on ice if not used immediately) passed 3 times through a 25-gauge needle, and diluted into binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 mM MgCl2,1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A-7888), pH 7.4, which is stored at 4°C after filtration through a 0.22 m filter, and to which has been freshly added 5 jig/ml aprotinin, 10 jiM bestatin, 10 uM diprotin A if the membranes are derived from tissue (rat, mouse, monkey, no DTT). Aliquots of 100 ul are added to iced 12x75 mm polypropylene tubes containing 100 jil of the appropriate radioligand and 100 ul of test compound at various concentrations. Total (TB) and nonspecific (NS) binding are determined in the absence and presence of 10 uM naloxone respectively. The tubes are vortexed and incubated at 25°C for 60-75 min, after which time the contents are rapidly vacuum-filtered and washed with about 12 ml/tube iced wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mM MgCl2) through GF/B filters (Whatman) presoaked for at least 2h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The radioactivity (dpm) retained on the filters is measured with a beta counter after soaking the filters for at least 12h in minivials containing 6-7 ml scintillation fluid. If the assay is set up in 96-place deep well plates, the filtration is over 96-place PEI-soaked unifilters, which are washed with 3 x 1 ml wash buffer, and dried in an oven at 55°C for 2h. The<br><br>
filter plates are counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 50 ul MS-20 scintillation fluid/well. In the case of assays performed in 96 deep well plates, the IC50 of compounds are evaluated from 10-point displacement curves in the case of Delta, and 5-point displacement curves in the case of Mu and Kappa. The assay is done in 300(il with the appropriate amount of membrane protein (2ug, 35u.g, and lu.g, in the case of Delta, Mu, and Kappa, respectively) and 50000-80000 dpm/well of the appropriate tracer (1251-Deltorphin II, 125I-FK33824, and 125I-DPDYN for Delta, Mu, and Kappa, respectively). The total binding and non-specific binding are determined in absence and presence of lOuM of Naloxone.<br>
Functional Assays<br>
The agonist activity of the compounds is measured by determining the degree to which the compounds receptor complex activates the binding of GTP to G-proteins to which the receptors are coupled. In the GTP binding assay, GTP[y]35S is combined with test compounds and membranes from HEK-293S cells expressing the cloned human opioid receptors or from homogenised rat or mouse brain. Agonists stimulate GTP[y]35S binding in these membranes. The ECjo and En^x values of compounds are determined from dose-response curves. Right shifts of the dose response curve by the delta antagonist naltrindole are performed to verify that agonist activity is mediated through delta receptors. For human 5 receptor functional assays, ECso (low) is measured when the human 8 receptors used in the assay were expressed at lower levels in comparison with those used in determining ECso (high). The Emax values were determined in relation to the standard 6 agonist SNC80, i.e., higher than 100% is a compound that have better efficacy than SNC80.<br>
Procedure for rat brain GTP<br>
Rat brain membranes are thawed at 37°C, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge blunt-end needle and diluted in the GTPyS binding (50 mM Hepes, 20 mM NaOH, 100 mM Nad, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2) pH 7.4, Add fresh: 1 mM DTT, 0.1% BSA). 120^M GDP final is added membranes dilutions. The EC50 and Emax of compounds are evaluated from 10-point dose-response curves done in 300ul with the<br>
appropriate amount of membrane protein (20n,g/well) and 100000-130000 dpm of GTPy35S per well (0.11 -0.14nM). The basal and maximal stimulated binding are determined in absence and presence of 3 uM SNC-80. The assay performed on HEK 293s cells stably expressing cloned Delta receptors is done in a slightly different buffer (50mM Hepes, 20mM NaOH, 200mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, Add fresh: 0.5% BSA, no DTT) and with a 3uM final cone, of GDP.<br>
Data analysis<br>
The specific binding (SB) was calculated as TB-NS, and the SB in the presence of various test compounds was expressed as percentage of control SB. Values of ICso and Hill coefficient (nn) for ligands in displacing specifically bound radioligand were calculated from logit plots or curve fitting programs such as Ligand, GraphPad Prism, SigmaPlot, or ReceptorFit. Values of K,- were calculated from the Cheng-Prussoff equation. Mean ± S.E.M. values of ICso, Kj and nn were reported for ligands tested in at least three displacement curves. Biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is indicated hi Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Table 1(Table Remove)<br>
Receptor Saturation Experiments<br>
Radioligand Kg values are determined by performing the binding assays on cell membranes with the appropriate radioligands at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5 times the estimated Kg (up to 10 times if amounts of radioligand required are feasible). The specific radioligand binding is expressed as pmole/mg membrane protein. Values of Kg and Bmax from individual experiments are obtained from<br>
nonlinear fits of specifically bound (B) vs. nM free (F) radioligand from individual according to a one-site model.<br>
Petermination Of Mechano-Allodvma Using Von Frev Testing<br>
Testing is performed between 08:00 and 16:00h using the method described by Chaplan et al. (1994). Rats are placed in Plexiglas cages on top of a wire mesh bottom which allows access to the paw, and are left to habituate for 10-15 min. The area tested is the mid-plantar left hind paw, avoiding the less sensitive foot pads. The paw is touched with a series of 8 Von Frey hairs with logarithmically incremental stiffness (0.41, 0.69,1.20, 2.04, 3.63, 5.50, 8.51, and 15.14 grams; Stoelting, HI, USA). The von Frey hair is applied from underneath the mesh floor perpendicular to the plantar surface with sufficient force to cause a slight buckling against the paw, and held for approximately 6-8 seconds. A positive response is noted if the paw is sharply withdrawn. Flinching immediately upon removal of the hair is also considered a positive response. Ambulation is considered an ambiguous response, and in such cases the stimulus is repeated.<br>
Testing Protocol<br>
The animals are tested on postoperative day 1 for the FCA-treated group. The 50% withdrawal threshold is determined using the up-down method of Dixon (1980). Testing is started with the 2.04 g hair, in the middle of the series. Stimuli are always presented in a consecutive way, whether ascending or descending. In the absence of a paw withdrawal response to the initially selected hair, a stronger stimulus is presented; in the event of paw withdrawal, the next weaker stimulus is chosen.<br>
Optimal threshold calculation by this method requires 6 responses in the immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold, and counting of these 6 responses begins when the first change in response occurs, e.g. the threshold is first crossed. In cases where thresholds fall outside the range of stimuli, values of 15.14 (normal sensitivity) or 0.41 (maximally allodynic) are respectively assigned. The resulting pattern of positive and negative responses is tabulated using the convention, X = no withdrawal; O = withdrawal, and the 50% withdrawal threshold is interpolated using the formula:<br>
50% g threshold = lO0^*^ / 10,000<br>
where Xf= value of the last von Frey hair used (log units); k = tabular value (from Chaplan et al. (1994)) for the pattern of positive / negative responses; and 8 = mean difference between stimuli (log units). Here 5 = 0.224.<br>
Von Frey thresholds are converted to percent of maximum possible effect (% MPE), according to Chaplan et al. 1994. The following equation is used to compute % MPE:<br>
% MPE = Drug treated threshold (g) - allodvnia threshold (s) X 100 Control threshold (g) - allodynia threshold (g)<br>
Administration Of Test Substance<br>
Rats are injected (subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or orally) with a test substance prior to von Frey testing, the time between administration of test compound and the von Frey test varies depending upon the nature of the test compound.<br>
Writhing Test<br>
Acetic acid will bring abdominal contractions when administered intraperitoneally in mice. These will then extend their body in a typical pattern. When analgesic drugs are administered, this described movement is less frequently observed and the drug selected as a potential good candidate.<br>
A complete and typical Writhing reflex is considered only when the following elements are present: the animal is not in movement; the lower back is slightly depressed; the plantar aspect of both paws is observable. In this assay, compounds of<br><br>
the present invention demonstrate significant inhibition of writhing responses after<br>
oral dosing of 1-100 /unol/kg.<br>
(i) Solutions preparation<br>
Acetic acid (AcOH): 120 fiL of Acetic Acid is added to 19.88 ml of distilled water in<br>
order to obtain a final volume of 20 ml with a final concentration of 0.6% AcOH. The<br>
solution is then mixed (vortex) and ready for injection.<br>
Compound (drug): Each compound is prepared and dissolved in the most suitable<br>
vehicle according to standard procedures.<br>
(ii) Solutions administration<br>
The compound (drug) is administered orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.)) at 10 ml/kg (considering the average mice body weight) 20, 30 or 40 minutes (according to the class of compound and its characteristics) prior to testing. When the compound is delivered centrally: Intraventricularly (i.c.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.) a volume of 5 uL is administered.<br>
The AcOH is administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in two sites at 10 ml/kg (considering the average mice body weight) immediately prior to testing, (iii) Testing<br>
The animal (mouse) is observed for a period of 20 minutes and the number of occasions (Writhing reflex) noted and compiled at the end of the experiment. Mice are kept in individual "shoe box" cages with contact bedding. A total of 4 mice are usually observed at the same time: one control and three doses of drug.<br>
For the anxiety and anxiety-like indications, efficacy has been established in the geller-seifter conflict test in the rat.<br>
For the functional gastrointestina disorder indication, efficacy can be established in the assay described by Coutinho SV et al, in American Journal of Physiology - Gastrointestinal &amp; Liver Physiology. 282(2):G307-16, 2002 Feb, in the rat.<br>
ADDITIONAL IN VIVO TESTING PROTOCOLS<br>
Subjects and housing<br>
Naive male Sprague Dawley rats (175-200g) are housed in groups of 5 in a temperature controlled room (22°C, 40-70% humidity, 12-h,light/dark). Experiments are performed during the light phase of the cycle. Animals have food and water ad libitum and are sacrificed immediately after data acquisition.<br>
Sample<br>
Compound (Drug) testing includes groups of rats that do not receive any treatment and others that are treated with E. coli lipopolysaccharide(LPS). For the LPS-treated experiment, four groups are injected with UPS, one of the four groups is then vehicle-treated whilst the other three groups are injected with the drug and its vehicle. A second set of experiments are conducted involving five groups of rats; all of which receive no LPS treatment. The nai've group receives no compound (drug) or vehicle; the other four groups are treated with vehicle with or without drug. These are performed to determine anxiolytic or sedative effects of drugs which can contribute to a reduction in USV.<br>
Administration of LPS<br>
Rats are allowed to habituate in the experimental laboratory for 15-20 min prior to treatment. Inflammation is induced by administration of LPS (endotoxin of gram-negative E. coli bacteria serotype 0111:B4, Sigma). LPS (2.4jj.g) is injected intracerebro-ventricularly (i.c.v.), in a volume of lOul, using standard stereotaxic surgical techniques under isoflurane anaesthesia. The skin between the ears is pushed rostrally and a longitudinal incision of about 1cm is made to expose the skull surface. The puncture site is determined by the coordinates: 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral (left) to the lambda (sagittal suture), and 5 mm below the surface of the skull (vertical) in the lateral ventricle. LPS is injected via a sterile stainless steel needle (26-G 3/8) of 5 mm long attached to a 100-ul Hamilton syringe by polyethylene tubing (PE20; 10-15 cm). A 4 mm stopper made from a cut needle (20-<br>
G) is placed over and secured to the 26-G needle by silicone glue to create the desired 5mm depth.<br>
Following the injection of LPS, the needle remains in place for an additional 10 s to allow diffusion of the compound, then is removed. The incision is closed, and the rat is returned to its original cage and allowed to rest for a minimum of 3.5h prior to testing.<br>
Experimental setup for air-puff stimulation<br>
The rats remains in the experimental laboratory following LPS injection and compound (drug) administration. At the time of testing all rats are removed and placed outside the laboratory. One rat at a time is brought into the testing laboratory   ' and placed in a clear box (9x9x18 cm) which is then placed in a sound-attenuating ventilated cubicle measuring 62(w) x35(d) x46(h) cm (BRS/LVE, Div. Tech-Serv Inc). The delivery of air-puffs, through an air output nozzle of 0.32 cm, is controlled by a system (AirStim, San Diego Intruments) capable of delivering puffs of air of fixed duration (0.2 s) and fixed intensity with a frequency of 1 puff per 10s. A maximun of 10 puffs are administered, or until vocalisation starts, which ever comes first. The first air puff marks the start of recording.<br>
Experimental setup for and ultrasound recording<br>
The vocalisations are recorded for 10 minutes using microphones (G.R.A.S. sound and vibrations, Vedbaek, Denmark) placed inside each cubicle and controlled by LMS (LMS CADA-X 3.5B, Data Acquisition Monitor, Troy, Michigan) software. The frequencies between 0 and 32000Hz are recorded, saved and analysed by the same software (LMS CADA-X 3.5B, Time Data Processing Monitor and UPA (User Programming and Analysis)).<br>
Compounds (Drugs)<br>
All compounds (drugs) are pH-adjusted between 6.5 and 7.5 and administered at a volume of 4 ml/kg. Following compound (drug) administration, animals are returned to their original cages until time of testing.<br>
Analysis<br>
The recording is run through a series of statistical and Fourier analyses to filter (between 20-24kHz) and to calculate the parameters of interest. The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is assessed using T-test for comparison between naive and LPS-treated rats, and one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test (post-hoc) for drug effectiveness. A difference between groups is considered significant with a minimum p value of ^0.05. Experiments are repeated a minimum of two times.<br>
Determination of theirnal hyperalgesia using the Harereaves plantar test<br>
Administration of FCA or carrageenan<br>
Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA): SIGMA cat.# F 5881, Mycabacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra, ATCC 25177), Img/ml, heat killed, dried, 0.85 ml paraffin, 0.15 ml mannide monooleate.   Or carrageenan Lambda type IV(Cg): SIGMA cat.# C-3889, (Gelatin, vegetable; Irish moss), (1.0% solution) in NaCl.<br>
Injections are done with a Hamilton syringe with a sterile needle size 26G5/8". Rats are handled and placed in chamber for anaesthesia with isoflurane. When the desired effect is reached, the rat is removed and placed on ventral decubitus (sternal position). The left hind paw is grasped and the needle is introduced subcutaneous, ventral aspect, between footpad of finger # 2 and # 3 in order the reach the middle of the paw (metatarsal area). Finally, a volume of lOOul FCA, or lOOul of carrageenan solution, is slowly injected into the paw, and a small pressure is applied for 3-4 seconds after removal of needles.<br>
If the animals are waking up during the procedure, they are then return in the inhalation chamber until desired effect is reached.<br>
After the intraplantar injection, the animals are allowed to wake up under observation in their cage.<br>
For FCA treatment, rats are allowed 48 hours for the development of the inflammatory process. For carrageenan treatment, rats are allowed 3 hours for the development of the inflammatory process.On the morning of the test, rats are placed<br>
in the lab (in their cages). They are allowed to habituate to the room for at least 30<br>
minutes.<br>
Test Site<br>
The heat stimulus is applied to the center of the plantar surface, in between the pads. The test site must be in contact with the glass, with no urine or feces in between, hi order to maintain the correct heat transfer properties from the glass to the skin.<br>
The plantar apparatus consists of a box with a glass top/platform, the glass surface is maintained at 30°C by an internal feedback mechanism. Underneath this glass platform is a light bulb mounted on a moveable arm, a mirror is placed underneath to allow the light to be positioned under the rat's paw. When the light is activated it shines through an aperture of ~2mm diameter. The experimenter activates the light, and automatic sensors turn the light off when the paw is removed; a cut-off of 20.48 seconds ensures that no tissue damage will occur should the rat fail to remove his paw. The experimenter may also turn off the light at any point. A Timer will record the duration of time that the light is activated.<br>
Flux meter: measures the flux/cm2 when the light is activated. This should be maintained at -97-98; the flux can be modified by adjusting the plantar device, but must never be changed in the middle of an experiment. Time-Course<br>
The experiment can be performed after varying lengths of time following the induction of inflammation. Hyperalgesia is measured at 48hpost-FCA injection or 3h post-carrageenan injection.<br>
Test Procedure<br>
Naive rats: For the procedure of establishing a Dose Response Curve, one group of 7 rats is used as a control group; they are anesthetised with the remaining 28 rats, but are not given any injection. Testing of the naive group may be done either prior to beginning or immediately following the experiment, with the minimum stress possible, the rats are placed in individual Plexiglas boxes (14 x 21 x 9cm) on top of the plantar device; they are allowed to habituate for a period of 30 minutes. When the animals are ready to test, the light is placed directly under the test-site and activated,<br>
and the latency to withdrawal is recorded. After a period of 5-8 minutes, to allow skin temperature to return to normal, a second reading is taken, and the rats are then removed and replaced in their cage.<br>
baseline Values: The remaining 28 rats (divided into 4 groups) that have been injected with FCA (or carrageenan) are placed in individual boxes on the machine and allowed to habituate for 30 minutes. The experimenter should verify the degree of inflammation of the paw and check for discoloration. The heat stimulus is placed under the test site, and the latency to withdrawal is recorded; two readings are taken, as above. It is the comparison of these baseline values with those of the naive animals that establishes whether hyperalgesia is present.<br>
Post-drug testing: Once hyperalgesia is established, the rats are injected with the compound of interest. Each compound is prepared and dissolved in the most suitable vehicle according to standard procedures. The administration route, doses, volume, and time of testing after injection is specific for that compound (or class of compounds). When testing compounds at 20-30 minutes post-injection, such as for i.v. or s.c. injections, rats are placed and allowed to habituate on the plantar apparatus while the drug produces its effect. When testing compounds at 60 minutes or more following the injection, rats are placed back in their original cage with their cage mates. Rats are always replaced in their original cages with their original cage mates to minimize the stress of re-establishing a social structure within a group of rats. SOmin later rats are placed one the plantar and allowed 30 minutes to habituate to the plantar machine. Testing is performed as described above. Two readings are taken Criteria for Testing:<br>
The animal must be calm and quiet, yet alert, and in the correct position, with no urine or feces between the skin of the paw and the glass surface of the machine. An animal should not be tested if:<br>
-	The animal is in locomotion, including sniffing, grooming and exploring.<br>
-	The animal is sleeping.<br>
-	The animal is showing obvious signs of stress (tonic immobility, vocalizations, ears<br>
flat), unless these are the possible result of a compound side effect and cannot be<br>
avoided.<br>
-	The animal is positioned in such a way that the paw is not in direct contact with the<br>
glass (paw resting on top of tail);<br>
-	The animal's paw is displaying blue coloring as a result of a bad injection. la this<br>
case, the animal is rejected from the experiment completely (at the beginning).<br>
When urine or feces are present, the animal is removed, the glass surface is wiped clean, and then the animal is replaced. When the animal is sleeping, or exhibiting tonic immobility, the experimenter may gently move the box or move their hand in front of the box to elicit a short-term attentional behaviour. Close observation of the animal's behaviour should be conducted throughout the test.<br>
Re-Tests:<br>
At any time during the experiment, if the experimenter is not certain that the paw withdrawal response was not a response to the heat stimulus, the animal may be re-tested after 5-8 minutes. This may be due to the animal moving suddenly, or urinating or defecating while the stimulus is being applied.<br>
Acceptable responses:<br>
any of the following are considered responses to the heat stimulus<br>
-Withdrawal movement of the paw off the glass (often followed by paw licking)<br>
-	Lateral movement of the body (contralateral for the stimulated paw)<br>
-	Toes are moving off the glass<br>
-	the centroplanar (middle paw) aspect of the inflamed paw is removed from the<br>
glass.<br>
Analysis<br>
The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is assessed using T-test for comparison between naive and inflamed rats, and one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test (post-hoc) for drug effectiveness. A difference between groups is considered significant with a minimum p value of
