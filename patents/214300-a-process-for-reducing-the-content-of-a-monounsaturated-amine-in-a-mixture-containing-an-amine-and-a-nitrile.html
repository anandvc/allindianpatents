				<td>Reducing the content of an unsaturated amine in a mixture containing an amine and a nitrile<br>
i The present invention relates to a process for reducing the content of a monounsaturated aliphatic amine (III) in a mixture (iV) containing at aminonitrile {I)   or a diamine (II), or mixtures thereof, and the amine (III) , wherein<br>
a)  the mixture (I""} is reacted with an anionic nucleophile (V).<br>
which contains a nucleophilic atom selected from the group comprising oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur,<br>
which is capable of taking up an H+ ion to form an acid with a pKg ranging from 7 to 11, measured in water at 25°C, and<br>
which has a relative nucleophilicity, measured in methyl<br>
perchlorate/methanol at 25°C,<br>
ranging from 3.4 to 4.7 when oxygen is the nucleophilic atom,<br>
ranging from 4.5 to 5.S when nitrogen is the nucleophilic<br>
atom, and<br>
ranging from 5,5 to c.S when sulfur is the nucleophilic atom,<br>
in an amount ranging from C.Cl to 10 m.cl per mole of amine (III) in the mixture (IV), to give a mixture (VI), and<br>
b)  the aminonitrile {I)   or the diamine (II), or mixtures<br>
thereof, are distilled from, the miixture {VI) at a temperature ranging from 5C to 170°C and a pressure ranging from 0.5 to 100 kPa.<br>
Mixtures containing an amincnitrile or a diaimine, or mixtures thereof, and an unsaturated aimine - an unsaturated amine being understood in terms of the present invention as meaning a cyclic or linear compound containing at least one carbon-nitrogen double bond or a compound capable of forming at least one carbor.-nitroger. double bond, for example by an elimination reaction - are conventionally obtained in the partial hydrogenation of dinitriles to aminonitriles or a mixture of aminonitriles and diamines, or in the complete hydrogenation of dinitriles to diamines .<br>
The partial hydrogenation of adipodinitrile (ADN) with the simultaneous production of hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and 6-aminocapronitrile (ACN), and the complete hydrogenation of ADN to HMD, in the presence of a catalyst based on a metal such as<br><br>
nickel, cobalt, iron, rhodium or rutheniurr., is generally known e.g. from K, weissermel, H.-J. Arpe, Industrielle Organische Cheir.ie (Industrial Organic Chemistry) , 3rd edition, VCH Verlagsgesel J schaf r mbH. Weinheirr,, 1588, page 265, US-A 4 601 859, US-A 2 762 825, US-A 2 208 £98, DE-A 848 654, DE-A 954 416, DE-A 42 35 466, US-A 3 656 153, DE-A 1950C222, WO-A-92/21650 and DE-A-19548285.<br>
The byproducts fonr.ed are, inter alia, azepine derivatives such as N-(2-azepano)-],e-diaminohexane,<br>
N-{2-azepano)-6-aminocapronitrile and, in particular, 2-air.inoazepan and cetrahydroazepine (THA) .<br>
These azepine derivatives, which cause coloration and impair the product properties and are therefore unwanted impurities in the aininonitriles and diairiines conventionally used for the manufacture of synthetic fibers or engineering plastics, can be separated from the aminonitriles, diamines or mixtures thereof only at considerable expense.<br>
EP-A-497333 describes the separation of aliphatic aminonitriles or aliphatic diamines from mixtures containing an aliphatic aminonitrile or aliphatic diamine and a cyclic, monounsaturated aliphatic amine by the addition of bases, zhe base being used in stoichiometric excess relative to the cyclic, monounsaturated aliphatic amine.  Bases recommended for this separation are alkali metal hydrcxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides and alkaline earth metal alkoxides.<br>
The disadvantage of this process is a simultaneous polymerization of valuable product which leads to an appreciable loss of valuable product and to unwanted deposits in the apparatuses and machines used for carrying out the process.<br>
It is an object of che present invention to provide a process for reducing the contenz of a monounsaturated aliphatic amine in a mixture containing an aminonitrile or a diamine, or mixtures thereof, and a monounsaturated aliphatic amdne, in a technically simple and economic manner which avoids said disadvantages.<br>

The distillation can be carried out in several columns, such as 2 cr 3 ccl"jmns, and advantageously in a single cclumLn.<br>
Aminonitriles and diamines are precursors for the preparation of industrially important pclyamides such as nylon 6 or nylon 6.6.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
500 ml or 6-aminocapronitrile with a tetrshydroazepine (THA) content of 300 ppm by weight were treated with 3D mol%, based on TKA, cf potassium phthalimide and distilled at 96°C  and 0.5 kPa (bottom temperature 110-115°C] over a distillation column 1 m in length containing V2A wire-gauze rings.  After 450 ml had distilled over, the distillation was stopped.  6 ppm of TKA were found in the distillate.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
500 ml of 6-aminocapronitrile with a THA content of 1% by weight were treated with 5C mol%, based on THA, of potassium phthalimide and distilled at 96°C and 0.5 kPa (bottom temperature 110-115°C] over a distillation column 1 m in length containing V2A wire-gauze rings.  After 450 ml had distilled over, the distillation was stopped.  0.09% by weight of THA was found in the distillate.<br>
Example 3<br>
For the continuous separation of THA from t-aminocapronitrile, 6-aminocapror.itrile with a THA content of 300 ppm by weight was pumped continuously into a 750 ml tank in which a suspension of potassium phthalimide in 6-aminocapronitrile with a THA content of 300 ppm by weight was being stirred at 56°C.  The resulting potassium phthalimide content of the solution was 160-170 ppm by weight.<br>
This solution was pumped continuously out of the tank into a 250 ml distillation flask, from which the ACN was distilled at 10 mbar and a bottom temperature of 118°C over a column 30 cm in length containing V2A wire-gause rings.<br>
With a loading rate of 210 ml/h, a take-off/reflux ratio of 50:50 and a bottom discharge rate of 10 ml/h, 30 ppm by weight of THA were found in the distillate.  The yield of 6-aminocapronitrile was  95%.<br><br><br>
