				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a head scarf for covering head and neck and, in particular, to a head scarf for women which would provide for the required covering of the area of the head, ears and the neck and attractively expose the front face of the wearer. Importantly, the head scarf is specifically developed to favour the desired covering of the rear of the head along with the ears and the neck portion of women maintaining the open front face of the individual as an elegant and attractive designer wear. The headscarf is user friendly and extremely comfortable to wear especially for women and is adapted to ensure proper comfortable disposition even in case of women having long hair bundled / knotted at the rear of the head. The head scarf of the invention could serve effectively to cover the head, ears and neck of women such as required during winter to cover from cold and also serve as an attractive headgear as a fashion outfit or for any occasion requiring women to cover their head, ear and neck.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known to provide for variety of headgears and clothing which could effectively cover the head /ear or the neck of an individual which is essentially required in the winter season to avoid cold conditions.<br>
In particular, head caps of variety of shape and configuration are made available to the art to one hand ensure protection of the head from chilly and cold conditions in the winter and on the other hand to provide variety of shape and configuration to suit the end users head configuration for effective fitting.<br>
While caps of various designs for the above purposes are well known and in use for decades, the requirements for effective protection of the ear, nose and the neck has brought about further developments in such clothing for protection against cold,<br>
2<br><br>
In particular, over the years cap designs have been developed which apart from providing for covering the head would also cover the ears of the wearer for protection during the winter.<br>
In order to protect the neck along with the head and the ear, protective woolen wear has also been devised which is traditionally well known as "monkey cap" which protect the ear, neck as well as the nose apart from the head of the wearer and thereby provide for a very warm and comfortable protective headgear for individuals requiring protection against cold condition especially in the winter.<br>
Thus, the above reveals the need in the art to provide for woolen and / or other variety of clothing, which could effectively cover the head or ear and neck of the wearer. However, all the existing and presently available headgears and / or related protective clothing made available in the art while providing for the required coverage to prevent access of cold in and around the face have some inherent problems and disadvantages which do not make it attractive or comfortable to wear in case it is required to be worn by a woman. In particular, most of the caps having protective mechanism extending upto the ear region have very unacceptable shape and configuration which do not match with a woman's facial and scalp configuration. Also, while money caps and the like provide for a complete coverage of the ear and neck, the requirement of its wearing through the head and its unacceptable outlook/get up make it not convenient to wear as far as women are concerned who are usually beauty and fashion conscious.<br>
Importantly, also women, unlike men, usually have long hair which are bundled/ knotted at the rear of the head and the conventional caps / monkey caps or the like do not have the provision to provide for adequate space to accommodate such long hair bundles / knot usually found at the back/rear of a woman's head.<br>
Moreover, considering the beauty and aesthetic outlook required by women to maintain the desired womanish appearance, such conventional caps and mufflers etc. are found to affect the maintaining of the desired beauty and outlook of the wearer. In particular, in case of women it is always desired that the cap / head<br>
3<br><br>
covering should apart from completely revealing the front face should also preferably reveal at least a part of the front of the head to expose the hair at the front above the forehead to maintain the required facial beauty and external appearance.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for woman, which would on one hand provide for the desired covering for the head, ear and neck of women such as required for protection from cold conditions and at the same time essentially maintain the much required facial beauty and attractive outlook for the wearer and further also serve as a designer wear/ apparel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a head scarf cum neck covering for woman which would be adapted to effectively and comfortably cover the head without problems of accommodating the bundle / knotted hair at the rear in case of long haired women.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to head scarf cum neck covering for women which would apart from serving the purposes of effective covering of the head, ear and neck would also provide for required front opening to reveal the face and also the front top of the head just above the forehead to maintain the desired beauty and facial attraction of the wearer of the scarf.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for women which would be adapted to fit for women of all ages and of varied facial /scalp configuration and would be equally attractive to all women folk.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for head scarf cum neck covering for women which would be simple and user friendly to use and can be readily worn by the wearer without bothering to disturb any facial and / or hair make up / arrangement.<br>
4<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for women which would be cost effective to obtain and hence widely acceptable and available for variety of end uses / applications.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for woman which would be convenient to carry and can be readily accommodated in any conventional kit bags of women.<br>
A further object is to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for women which would be suited to any woman wearing any variety of dress material including typical Indian clothing like saris , salwar suits and the like.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES:<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 1 which illustrates an embodiment of the head scarf cum neck covering in accordance with the present invention. As shown in the figure, the head scarf cum neck covering (1) basically comprises of neck covering portion (2) and a cap region (3).The cap region (3) is selectively disposed at a position which is closer from one end of the neck covering and distanced from the other end of the neck covering(2).<br>
As would be clearly apparent from the rear view (Figure 2) of the head scarf cum neck covering in accordance with the invention, in order to achieve proper concaved internal configuration for the cap portion (3) to accommodate the wearers head possibly alongwith the hair knot, the said cap portion is basically preferably obtained as discussed hereunder in relation to accompanying Figures 3A and 3B.<br>
As clearly illustrated in Figure 3A, the cap portion (3) is obtained of a substantially trapezoidal shaped material having two substantially parallel sided (3a &amp; 3b) and two non-parallel sides (3c &amp; 3d).<br>
The manner of obtaining the cap portion and its stitching with respect to the neck portion (2) is described hereunder in relation to figure 3B.<br>
It would be clearly apparent from Figure 3A that the cap material comprises the two substantially parallel longitudinal edges (3a &amp; 3b) of which one is bigger (3a) and the other smaller (3b) in length defining a substantially trapezoidal configuration, with the end regions (3bl &amp; 3b2) of the smaller of the two parallel edges close together such that the two non parallel sides (3c &amp; 3d) of the trapezoidal shaped part are disposed alongside in a continuous line which are<br>
10<br><br>
stitched to atleast a portion (2a) of a longitudinal edge of the rectangular neck covering portion (2) such that the said bigger (3a) of the parallel longitudinal edge of the cap portion assumes a circular configuration with a concaved inside to accommodate the head portion , the smaller (3b) longitudinal edge being bundled (3B) and stitched together to provide for plurality of pleated/streaked extensions (3P)  spreading from said bundled and stitched region.<br>
Preferably, the said stitching of the two non parallel sides on the portion (2a) of the neck covering portion is at a position such that the cap region (3) is disposed closer from one end of the neck covering than from its other end and provides for substantial lengths of the rectangular neck covering to hang from the front and also from the back upon wrapping of the neck.<br>
Importantly, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, the said smaller longitudinal edge (3b) after the stitching of the non- parallel sides with respect to the neck covering portion is bundled (3B) by providing a threaded needle (4)to traverse close adjacent its edge and thereafter tightening the threaded link to bundle the end region and in the process create the said pleated/streaked extensions    (3P) spreading from said bundled and stitched region.<br>
It would be apparent that depending upon the size of the wearers' head the concaved portion can be selectively obtained of the semi-circular concaved cap region in the head scarf of the invention. The converging bundled portion (3B) at about the center of the cap region is clearly illustrated in Figure 2. Advantageously, while providing the converging bundled region (3B) , the rear of the cap achieves plurality of streaks like pleated (3P) which provide for a decorative / ornamental outlook at the rear apart from serving functional purpose of providing the concaved inside (5) of the cap region.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 4A and 4B which illustrate the head scarf cum neck covering of the invention as worn by a woman comfortably. Advantageously, the head scarf cum neck covering of the invention is very simple to wear since the same can first be put around the head by the cap region and, thereafter, the extending neck region can be suitably wrapped around the neck with one end at the front and the other end at the back of the<br>
11<br><br>
wearer to maintain the scarf comfortably in position even if the wearer is walking or made to run. The complete coverage of the head alongwith the knotted hair, ear and neck are clearly apparent from the illustration in figure 4A while the comfortable setting of the cap region over the hair / knotted or bundled at the rear of the wearer's head achieved by way of converging rear of the cap region is shown in figure 4B.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a head scarf cum neck covering for woman, which would on one hand provide for the desired covering for the head alongwith knotted hair , ear and neck of women such as required for protection from cold conditions and at the same time essentially maintain the much required facial beauty and attractive outlook for the wearer and further also serve as a designer wear/ apparel.<br>
Importantly, the head scarf and neck covering for women of the invention would ensure that apart from serving effectively the functional purposes of comfortably covering the woman's head, ear and neck, the same ensures that the front face of the wearer preferably including also a portion of the hair just above the forehead can be left open such that the beauty and attractive facial outlook of a woman's face is not affected by the wearing of the head and neck covering of the invention.<br>
Importantly also the head scarf cum neck covering for women is developed such that it would be adapted to fit for women of all ages and of varied facial /scalp configuration and would be equally attractive to all women folk and suited with any variety of dress materials including typical Indian clothing like saris, salwar suits and the like. The head scarf and neck covering of the invention would thus serve to add value and purpose to a head scarf for its wide scale application and use by women of all walks of life.<br>
