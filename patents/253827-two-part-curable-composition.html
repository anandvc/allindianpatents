PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describe and the manner in which it is  to be  performed :<br><br>
s the invention<br><br><br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a two-part room temperature curable, storage-stable composition which on combination of the two parts undergoes rapid curing to provide a polyurethane-polysiloxane resin mixture.<br>
Polysiloxanes (silicones) and poly ure thanes possess very different, but highly useful, physical and mechanical properties which have led to their widespread use in countless applications. Attempts have been made to provide a single composition exhibiting the desirable properties of both types of resin but thus far are believed to have been largely unsuccessful. While copolymers of polysiloxanes and poly ure thanes are known, they are considered to be difficult and costly to manufacture. Uniform physical blends of polysiloxanes and polyurethanes have also been difficult to achieve due to the highly incompatible properties of these resins and their pronounced tendency to undergo phase separation following their initial admixture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a two-part curable composition which is stable during storage as two parts and on their combination cures to provide a substantially uniform potymethane-polysiloxane resin mixture, the composition comprising:<br>
a)	a substantially moisture-free first part comprising moisture-curable silylated poryurethaite resin and crosslinl.er for the crosslinl'ing of silanol-terrninated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
b)	a second part comprising silanol-terrninated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
c)	a condensation catalyst in the first and/or second part; and, optionally,<br>
2<br><br>
d) at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of filler, UV stabilizer, antioxidant, adhesion promoter, cure accelerator, thixotropic agent, plas'dcizer, moisture scavenger, pigment, dye, surfactant, solvent and biocide, the additional component being present in the first part and/or second part, whichever part(s) the component is compatible therewith.<br>
The expression "substantially uniform polyurethane-polysiloxane resin mixture" as used herein refers to a resinous composition containing moisture-cured, i.e., hydrolyzed and subsequently crosslinhed, silylatecl polyurethane (SPU) resin in intimate admixture with crosslinl:ed silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane (SDPS) resin, the composition in bull: exhibiting substantially uniform mechanical properties throughout. While it is not understood at this time precisely how or in what manner the crosslinTed SPU resin and crosslinked SDPS resins are associated with each other in the resin mixture, it is believed , subject to later scientific demonstration, that the association involves few, if any, covalent bonds between the two resins.<br>
Owing to the substantially homogeneous nature of the polyurethane-polysiloxane hybrid resin of this invention, the resin exhibits excellent physical properties, e.g., high modulus and high tensile strength which are typical characteristics of the crosslinked SPU resin component of the resin mixture and good weatherability and high thermostability which are typical characteristics of the crosslinked SDPS component of the hybrid resin.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The substantially uniform polyurethane-polysiloxane resin mixture of the present invention is obtained by combining, i.e., admixing, the two-part curable composition as hereinafter more fully described. The two parts constituting the curable composition, respectively, the "first part" and the "second part", while separated<br>
3<br><br>
from each other exhibit storage stability of an indefinite duration but once combined, undergo rapid cure to provide the resin mixture herein.<br>
A.       The First Part of the Curable Composition<br>
The first part of the two-part curable composition herein contains a silylated polyurethane (SPU) resin, a crosslinker for diorganopolysiloxane wherein the silicon atom at each polymer chain end is silanol terminated ("silanol-terrninated diorganopolysiloxane", or SDPS) and, optionally, one or more other ingredients by which the overall curable composition may be adapted to function as a sealant, adhesive or coating as desired.<br>
Moisture-curable silylatecl polyurethanes which can be employed in the first part of the curable composition are known materials and in general can be obtained by (a) reacting an isocyanate-terminated polyurethane (PU) prepolymer with a suitable silane, e.g., one possessing both hydrolyzable functionality, specifically, one to three alhoxy groups for each silicon atom, and active hydrogen functionality, e.g., mercapto, primary amine and, advantageously, secondary amine, which is reactive for isocyanate, or by (b) reacting a hyclroxyl-terminated PU prepolymer with a suitable isocyanate-terrninated silane, e.g., one possessing one to three alhoxy groups, the details of these reactions, and those for preparing the isocyanate-terrninated and hyclroxyl-terminated PU prepolymers employed therein can be found in, amongst others: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,985,491, 5,919,888, 6,197,912, 6,207,794, 6,303,731, 6,359,101 and 6,515,164 and published U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2004/0122253 and 2005/0020706 (isocyanate-terrninated PU prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,786,081 and 4,481,367 (hydroxyl-terminated PU prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,627,722, 3,632,557, 3,971,751, 5,623,044, 5,852,137, 6,197,912, 6,207,783 and 6,310,170 (moisture-curable SPU resin obtained from reaction of isocyanate-terrninated PU prepolymer and reactive silane, e.g., aminoalkoxysilane); and, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,345,053, 4,625,012, 6,833,423 and published U.S. Patent Application 2002/0198352 (moisture-curable SPU resin obtained from reaction of hydroxyl-<br>
4<br><br>
terminated PU prepolymer and isocyanatosilane). The entire contents of the foregoing U.S. patent documents are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
(a) Moisture-curable SFUR Resin Obtained From Isocyanate- terminated PUR Prepolvmer<br>
The isocyctnate-terrninated PU prepolymers are obtained by reacting one or more polyols, advantageously, diols, with one or more polyisocyanates, advantageously, diisocyanates, in such proportions that the resulting prepolymers will be terminated with isocyanate. In the case of reacting a diol with a cliisocyanate, a molar excess of diisocyanate will be employed.<br>
Included among the polyols thai can be utilized for the preparation of the isocyanate- terminated PU prepolymer are polyether polyols, polyester polyols such as the hydroxyl-lerminated polycaprolactones, polyetherester polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of polyether polyol with e-caprolactone, polyesterether polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of hyclroxyl-terminated polycaprolac tones with one or more all;ylene oxides such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, hydroxyl- terminated polybutadienes, and the lil:e.<br>
Specific suitable polyols include the poly(oxyalkylene)ether cliols (i.e.. polyether diols), in particular, the poly(oxyethylene)ether diols, the poly(oxypropylene)ether cliols and the poly(oxyelhylene-oxypropylenc)ether diols, poly(oxyalkylene)ether triols, poly(tetimnethylene)ether glycols, polyacetals. polyhydroxy polyacrylates, polyhydroxy polyester amides, polyhydroxy polytliioethers, polycaprolac tone .diols and triols, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terrninated PU prepolymers are poly(oxyethylene)ether diols with equivalent weights between about 500 and 25,000. In another embodiment of the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terrninated PU prepolymers are poly(oxypropylene)ether diols<br>
5<br><br>
with equivalent weights between about 1,000 to 20,000. Mixtures of polyols of various structures, molecular Weights and/or functionalities can also be used.<br>
The polyether polyols can have a functionality up to about 8 but advantageously have a functionality of from 2 to 4 and more advantageously, a functionality of 2 (i.e., cliols). Especially suitable are the polyether polyols prepared in the presence of double-metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts, an alkaline metal hydroxide catalyst, or an alkaline metal alkoxide catalyst; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,829,505, 3,941,849, 4,242,490, 4,335,1SS, 4,687,851, 4,985,491, 5,096,993, 5,100,997, 5,106,874, 5,116,931, 5,136,010, 5,185,420 and 5,266,681, the entire contents of which are incorporated here by reference. Polyether polyols produced in the presence of such catalysts tend to have high molecular weights and lov/ levels of unsatitration, properties of which, it is believed, are responsible for the improved performance of inventive retroreflective articles. The polyether polyols preferably have a number average molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 25,000, more preferably from about 2,000 to about 20,000, and even more preferably from about 4,000 to about 1S,000. Examples of commercially available cliols that are suitable for making the isocyanate-tefminated PU prepolymer include APCC'L R-1819 (number average molecular weight of 8,000), E-2204 (number average molecular weight of 4,000), and AP.COL E-2211 (number average molecular weight of 11,000).<br>
Any of numerous polyisocyabates, advantageously, diisocyanates, and mixtures thereof, can be used to provide the isocyanate-terminated PU prepolymers. In one embodiment, the poly isocyanate car. be diphenylmethane diisocyanate ("MDI"), poly methylene polyphenylisocyanate ("PMDI"), paraphenylene diisocyanate, naphthylene diisocyanate, liquid carbodiimide-modifiecl MDI and derivatives thereof, isophorone diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate ("TDI"), particulcirly the 2,6-TDI isomer, as well as various other aliphatic and aromatic polyisoyanates that are well-established in the art and combinations thereof.<br>

Silylation reactants for reaction with the isocyanate-temiinatecl PUR prepolymers described above must contain functionality that is reactive with isocyanate and at least one readily hydrolyzable and subsequently crosslinl.able group, e.g., all.oxy. Particularly useful silylation reactants are the si lanes of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein X is an active hydrogen-containing group that is reactive for isocyanate, e.g., — SH or — NHR- in which R4 is H, a monovalent hydrocarbon group of up to S carbon atoms or — R5 — Si(R6)y(OR7)3-y, R1 and P.5 each is the same or different divalent hydrocarbon group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R2 and R6 is the same or different monovalent hydrocarbon group of up to 8 carbon atoms, each R3 and R7 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and x and y each, independently, is 0,1 or 2.<br>

A catalyst will ordinarily be used in the preparation of the isocyanate-terminated PU prepolyrners. Advantageously, condensation catalysts are employed since these will also catalyze the cure (hydrolysis followed by crosslinking) of the SPU resin component of the curable compositions of the invention. Suitable condensation catalyses include the cliallyltin dicarboxyiates such as dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin acetate, tertiary amines, the stannous salts of carboxylic acids, such as stannous octoate and stannous acetate, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention, dibutyltin dilaurate cataiyst is used in the production of the PUR<br>
8<br><br><br>
prepolymer. Other useful catalysts include zirconium-containing and bismuth-containing complexes such as KAT XC6212, K-KAT XC-A209 and K-KAT 348, supplied by King Industries/ Inc., aluminum chelates such as the TYZER® types, available from DuPont company, and the IT. types, available from Kenrich Petrochemical, Inc., and other organometallic catalysts, e.g., those containing a metal such as 2n5 Co, Ni, Fe, and the like.<br>
(b)      Moisture-curable SPUR Fesins Obtained From Hvdroxyl-terminated PUR Prepolymers<br>
The moisture-curable SPU resin of the first part of the curable composition of the invention can, as previously indicated, be prepared by reacting a<br>
hyclroxyl-terminated PU prepolymer with an isocyanatosilane. The hydroxyl-terminated PU prepolymer can be obtained in substantially the same manner employing substantially the same materials, i.e., polyols, polyisocyanates and optional catalysts (preferably condensation catalysts), described above for the preparation of isocyanate-terminated PU prepolymers the one major difference being that the proportions of polyol and poly isocyanate will be such as to result in hydroxyl- termination in the resulting prepolymer. Thus, e.g., in the case of a diol and a cliisocyanate, a molar excess of the former will be used thereby resulting in hydroxyl- terminated PU prepolymer.<br>
Useful silylation reactants for the hydroxyl-terminated SPU resins are those containing isocyanate termination and readily hyclrolizable functionality, e.g., 1 to 3 alkoxy groups. Suitable silylating reactants are the isocyanatosilanes of the general formula:<br><br>
9<br><br>
wherein P.8 is an alkylene group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R9 is the same or different alkyl or aryl group of up to S carbon atoms, each R10 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and y is 0, 1 or 2. In one embodiment, R8 possesses 1 to 4 carbon atoms, each R10 is the same or different methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl group and y is 0.<br>
Specific isocyanatosilanes that can be used herein to react with the foregoing hyclroxyl-temiinatecl PU prepolymers to provide moisture-curable SPU resins include isocyanatopropylfrimethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyl trimethoxysilane, isocyanato-n-bu ty1trime thoxy silane, isocyana to-t-buty1trimethoxysilane, isocyanatopropyltTiethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyltriethoxysilane, isocyanato-n-butyltriethoxysilane, isocyanato-t-butyltriethoxysilane, and the like.<br>
(c)       Crosslinker<br>
The crosslinker component in the first part of the curable composition is one which is effective for the crosslinking of silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane (SDPS), the latter being a component of the second part of the curable composition. In one embodiment, the crosslinker is an alkylsilicate of the general formula:<br>
(R12O)(R12O)(R13O)(Tf40)Si<br>
where R11, R12, R13 and R14 are independently chosen monovalent hydrocarbon radicals of up to about 60 carbon atoms.<br>
Crosslinkers useful herein include tetra-N-propyisilicate (NFS),<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate, methytrirnethoxysilane and similar alkyl substituted alkoxysilane compositions.<br>
B.        The Second Part of the Curable Composition<br>
10<br><br>
The silanoh terminated cliorganopolysiloxane polymer (SDPS) in the second part of the curable composition is advantageously selected from amongst those of the general formula:<br>
with the subscript a = 2 and b equal to or greater than 1 and with the subscript c zero or positive where<br>
with the subscript x = 0, 1 or 2 and the subscript y is either 0 or 1, subject to the limitation that x + y is less than or equal to 2, where R15 and R16 are independently chosen monovalent C1 to C60 hydrocarbon radicals; where<br>
D = R17R18SiOifl;<br>
where R17 and R18 are independently chosen monovalent C1 to C60 hydrocarbon radicals; where<br>
where R19 and R20 are independently chosen monovalent hydrocarbon radicals of up to about 60 carbon atoms.<br>
The foregoing SDPS polymer and their crosslinhing with alhyisilicate crosslinhers such as those described above are disclosed in further detail in published U.S. Patent Application 2005/0192337, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein<br>
11<br><br>
C.       Optional Ingredients<br>
Optionally, the first and/or second part of the curable composition can contain one or more additional ingredients, e.g., filler, UV stabilizer, antioxidant, adhesion promoter, cure accelerator, thixotropic agent, plasticizer, moisture scavenger, pigment, dye, surfactant, solvent and biocide, the additional component being present in the first part and/or second part, whichever part(s) the component is compatible therewith. Thus, e.g., filler, where present, can be in the first and/or second part; U. V. stabilizer where present, will ordinarily be in the first part; antioxidant, where present will ordinarily be in the first part; adhesion promoter, where present, will be in the first part; cure accelerator, where present, will usually be in the second part; thixotropic agent, where present, will generally be included in the first part; plasticizer, where present, is in the first and/or second part; moisture scavenger, where present, will be in the first part; pigment, where present, can be in the first and/or second part; dye, where present, can be in the first and/or second part; surfactant, where present, can be in the first and/or second part; solvent, where present, can be in the first and/or second part; and, biocide, where present, will be incorporated generally in the second part.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the two-part curable composition of the invention and the substantially uniform polyurethane-polysiloxane resin mixture obtained therefrom.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of a moisture-curable SPU resin derived from the reaction of an isocyanate-terminated PU prepolyrner and an aminosilane. The SPU resin was used in maling the first part of the two-part compositions of Examples 2-5 and the one-Dart composition of Comparative Example 1.<br>
12<br><br>
The SPU resin was made in a two-step reaction sequence substantially as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,602,964, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. In the first stage, isocyanate-terminated PU prepolymer was made by reacting a polypropylene ether diol (Acclaim 4200, 400 g) with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI, 34.Sg) in the presence of a trace amount of tin catalyst (dibutyltin dilaurate, 3.5 ppm). The prepolymer-forming reaction was carried out at 70-75°C until the concentration oi NCO dropped to 0.8% as measured by titration. In the second stage (silylation of the prepolymer), 17.6g of N-isobutylaminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was added to the prepolymer to react with all of the remaining NCO until no NCO was detectable by titration. The resulting moisture-curable SPU resin had a viscosity of about 100,000 cps at 25°C.<br>

In these examples, the following materials were utilized:<br><br><br><br><br>
13<br><br>
The following general procedures were used, employing the above materials, to prepare the two-part curable compositions of Examples 2-5 and the one-part curable composition of Comparative Example 1:<br>
A.	Two-part Curable Compositions (Examples 2-5)<br>
P-CaCCb, SM-CaCO?, and F-Sil were dried in an oven at 120°C for at least 12 hours prior to use.<br>
The first part of each two-part curable composition was prepared by mixing F-CaCCb, diisodecylphthalate plasticizer, F-Sil, TiO2, on a Speed Mixer DAC 400 FV at 2,000 rpm followed by sequential addition of SM-CaCOs, SFU resin, antioxidant, UV stabilizer, Silane A, isocyanurate and NFS in the amounts indicated in Table 1 until a thoroughly blended mixture was obtained.<br>
The second part of each two-part curable composition was prepared by mixing SDPS- 1, SDPS-2 and P-CaCOs in the amounts indicated below in Table 1 on the Speed Mixer at 2000 rpm for about two minutes followed, by additional DBTO condensation catalyst. The mixture was then blended on the Speed Mixer until a substantially homogeneous mixture was obtained.<br>
B.	One-part Curable Composition (Comparative Example U<br>
The one-part curcible composition was prepared as in the first part of the two-part curable composition described above but without NFS and with DBTO condensation catalyst being added last.<br>
The above two-part curable compositions were blended on the Speed Mixer for 1-2 minutes then east into films for mechanical testing and weatherability. Both the cast<br>
14<br><br>
films and the one-part curable composition, also provided as a cast film were cured under controlled condition:<br><br>
The results of the mechanical and weatherability tests carried out on the cured films were as follows:<br>
15<br><br><br>
As these data show, the cured resin mixtures of the invention (Examples 2-5), while inferior in tensile strength, Young's Modulus and percent elongation compared with the cured resin of Comparative Example 1, nevertheless demonstrated acceptable values for each of these properties owing, it is believed, to their cured SPUR resin content. However, the cured resins of the invention significantly out-performed the resin of Comparative Exarnplel in weatherability, a property believed to be attributable to the crosslinkecl polysiloxane content of the resins.<br>
