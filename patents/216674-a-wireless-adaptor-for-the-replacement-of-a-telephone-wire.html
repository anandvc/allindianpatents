				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present-invention relates to a wireless adaptor for replacement of telephone wire.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Customer premise devices that connect through a telephone interface, such as a telephone, a dial-up modem in a PC, dial-up modem in a laptop  a fax machine or any computing equipment, use a telephone wire for connecting the device to a telephone network, and through that to the Internet. Typically this is a twisted pair wire that connects the device to the wall outlet, thereby connecting it to the telephone network. A telephone wire is used for connectivity in other applications too, such as for connecting two PCs, laptops or other computing devices with each other for data transfer.<br>
The telephone wire provides the required electrical connectivity  for a voice or data communication session to be setup. However  the use of such a wire causes the following commonly faced problems:<br>
a)	The device needs to be placed close to the wall outlet thus constraining its location,<br>
b)	The device once cormected cannot be moved, thus constraining the user of the device to a specific physical location. As an example, if a laptop user wants to connect the laptop to the Internet using a dial-up modem through an ISP, the user is constrained by where the laptop can be placed, depending upon the length of the wire. Further, the wire constrains the user from moving around.<br>
c)	Moreover, the user can face problems such as disconnection due to the wire getting removed by mistake.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many solutions have been proposed in the past for mobile operation of otherwise stationary customer premise devices such as telephones, computers, fax machines and PDAs. There exist many cellular systems that provide for mobile data and voice capability, such as GSM/GPRS, CDMA and many others. They allow a user to typically access a cellular base station over several kilometers.<br>
However, these systems have certain limitations as follows:<br>
a)	They are firstly very expensive.<br>
b)	They require the user to depend upon a cellular infrastructure to be provided by the cellular operator. If a user wants to use a specific customer device in a<br><br>
wireless and wired mode interchangeably, such as a fax machine or credit card swipe machine, then he is unable to do so. c) Solutions have also been proposed for making telephone cordless (cordless phones) that can be connected to a fixed telephone line and provide the user with the flexibility of carrying around the handset. However, these units cannot make a laptop modem, PC modem or fax machine cordless as they support only voice communication.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present-invention is to address the above limitations through a<br>
novel solution that replaces a telephone wire by a wireless adaptor.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide for a wireless adaptor that connects into<br>
any standard telephone jack and can wirelessly communicate to another wireless<br>
adaptor.<br>
The main claims of this patent are identified below.    However, these are only<br>
indicative, and a complete description of the product follows, which encompasses<br>
these and other novel elements of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel wireless adaptor that replaces a telephone wire by a wireless adaptor. The wireless adaptor is completely equivalent in functionality to the wire; hence the user can use it to replace the wire between any two devices that connect using a telephone wire. Some examples of such connections are:<br>
a)	A telephone connected to a telephone wall socket<br>
b)	A PC, laptop or PDA modem cormected to a telephone wall socket.<br>
c)	A fax machine connected to a telephone wall socket<br>
d)	Two PCs, laptops or PDAs connected to each other through their modems<br>
The replacement of the wire allows the user to freely place the equipment anywhere at his convenience, within 100 m of the other equipment to which the first equipment is communicating. Further, the user can change the location of the equipment as many times as the user may want, without having to carry out any rewiring. Moreover, the adaptor is completely agnostic to the form of communication taking place through it, and so can be used without any change for both voice and data communication. Moreover,   it   does  not  require   a   telephone  network   to   be   in   place   for   the<br><br>
communication, and can be used even if two devices are communicating to each other directly through a telephone wire.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for taking the modem signal from a laptop modem through a RJ-11 connector and converting it into a signal that can be transmitted over a wireless connection. Further, a method is provided for communicating various control signals between the two adaptors. Finally, a method for charging the batteries of the adaptors using existing power of the laptop is described.<br>
The design is described in detail below.<br>
According to the present invention, the complete system comprises of two units, a<br>
mobile unit (hereinafter called MU) and a base unit (hereinafter called BU). The MU<br>
connects to any consumer device such as a laptop modem, PC modem, fax machine<br>
and credit card swipe machine.    The BU connects to the telephone wall socket<br>
provided by a telephone company. However, the BU can also be connected to another<br>
laptop modem or PC modem.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a novel wireless adaptor that replaces a telephone wire by a wireless adaptor. The wireless adaptor is completely equivalent in functionality to the wire; hence the user can use it to replace the wire connecting any telephone interface device such as a laptop modem, a computer modem, a fax machine, a credit card swipe machine and even a regular phone, to the telephone wall socket.   Such devices are hereinafter called as subscriber side equipment.<br><br>
MU Functional Blocks<br>
Reference is now made to Figure2 that details the block diagram of the MU system. The MU system design contains a control chaimel and a data channel, as indicated by the dashed and solid lines in Figure2. The control channel is used for communicating certain control information to the BU, while the data channel is used for the data communication.<br>
The Figure2 shows a MU system that connects to a laptop modem through a RJ-11 jack. The RJ-11 jack output in the MU system is connected to a Data Access Arrangement (DAA) and a Hook Detect Block.<br>
The DAA converts the modem"s two-wire interface to a four-wire interface. In a two-wire interface, both transmit and receive signals travel on one pair of wires. The DAA, uses an echo cancellation mechanism to split the combined signal into transmit and receive signals, each of which travel on separate two-wire lines, thus converting the interface to a four-wire interface.<br>
The received signal from the 2-wire interface has the actual received signal and some version of the transmitted signal echoing back due to an impedance mismatch at the 2-wire interface. Echo cancellation needs to remove the transmitted signal (possibly modified due to the mismatch) from the received signal. It does so by subtracting an amplitude and phase adjusted version of the transmitted signal from the received signal.The amplitude and phase adjustment is such that the adjusted version is exactly equal in amplitude and 180 degrees reversed in phase to the portion of the transmitted signal present in the received signal. This can be implemented using a passive design such as a hybrid transformer, an active design using operational amplifiers or a digital design using an echo cancellation filter in a digital signal processor. The determination of the amplitude and phase parameters which can produce an exact cancellation is carried out during this phase by sensing the 2-wire side line impedance.<br>
The two-wire interface is also connected in parallel to the Hook Detect Block, that senses when the laptop modem"s on-hook/off-hook status and accordingly informs a micro-controller.<br><br>
The transmit output of the DAA is sent to a signal conditioning block that changes the voltage levels of the signal to suit the wireless transmitter level. The output of the signal-conditioning block is sent to a wireless transmitter. The output of the wireless transmitter is sent to an antenna.<br>
The controller creates all the control signals and these are added to the data signal coming from the DAA arrangement to the input of the wireless transmitter. A voltage addition is carried out using a transistor circuit. Alternatively, an operational amplifier can also be used for this. The addition circuit is designed to ensure that the impedance offered by the output stage of one signal does not disturb the voltage level of the other. The wireless transmitter then sends both the control and the data signals to the BU.<br>
The receive output of the antenna is sent to a wireless receiver which in turn sends the signal to a signal-conditioning block and to the controller. The controller carries out tone detection using a novel cost-effective technique, described below in the section on Tone Detection. Depending upon the tone detected, the controller takes a certain control action. The output of the signal-conditioning block is sent to the controller and the DAA that adjusts the voltage level and impedance of the interface to match that of the DAA.<br>
BU Functional Blocks<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 3 that details the working of the BU unit. The BU unit connects to the telephone wall socket through a RJ-11 jack. The output of the RJ-11 jack is connected to a load circuit that can be switched in or out through a relay switch. When the load circuit is switched in, it provides impedance to the telephone line voltage, and allows a current to flow through it that is detected by the telephone exchange as an indication of the system going on-hook. When the switch is open the circuit is open and no current flows through it, thus indicating to the telephone exchange that the system is off-hook.<br>
The output of the RJ-11 jack through the switch is connected to a DAA, similar to the DAA of the MU side.   The transmit signal from the DAA is connected through a<br><br>
signal conditioning circuit to the wireless transmitter. The controller creates all the control signals required and these are added to the transmit signal from the DAA at the wireless transmitter input. The signal conditioning circuit adjusts the voltage as required by the wireless transmitter. The output of the wireless transmitter is connected to an antenna.<br>
The signal received from the antenna is sent to a wireless receiver. The output of the wireless receiver is sent to a signal conditioning circuit and the controller in parallel. The signal conditioning circuit adjusts the voltage level and impedance of the signal to match that of the DAA. The signal sent in parallel to the controller is used by it to detect the tone sent by the MU. Based on the tones sent, various control actions are taken by the BU.<br>
Initialization and Data Connection<br>
The initialization and connection steps are now explained in detail.<br>
Figure 4 and Figure 5 explains the state machines of the MU and BU in detail. At start-up, the MU is plugged into the laptop modem and switched on. The BU is plugged into the telephone wall socket and switched on.<br>
On being powered on, the micro-controllers on the MU and BU systems power-up their respective wireless transmitters and receivers and carry out authentication. A novel analog authentication mechanism is used to ensure that the MU and BU pair is authenticated with each other. This scheme is explained in detail later in the Authentication section. Once authentication is over, the transmitter and receiver of MU and the transmitter of BU is switched off<br>
After authentication, the BU waits for communication from the MU of a change in the hook status of the MU, as to whether it is on-hook or off-hook. A novel in-band signaling scheme is used to determine whether the MU is on-hook or off-hook. This is explained in detail in the section on Tone Detection below.<br>
When a user wants to connect to the Internet using the dial-up connection, the laptop modem goes off-hook. Once the laptop modem goes off-hook, the off-hook detect circuit senses this change and signals the micro-controller. Upon micro-controller getting this signal, it takes two actions, a) it sends a power-up signal to the transmitter and receiver of the MU and b) it sends a different frequency tone, f2, to the BU for a<br><br>
fixed duration, T, of time and then goes silent. Upon the power-up signal being received, the transmitter and receiver sections of the MU are programmed to transmit and receive signals.<br>
The change in the frequency from fl to f2 is detected by the BU to indicate that the MU has gone off-hook and in turn the BU takes the relay switch off-hook. Also, the BU then switches on its transmitter for fiirther communication. This completes the initialization action.<br>
Upon the initialization being completed, the MU modem starts dialing out and sending training sequences to train the modems. In the MU, the modem of the laptop is connected to a DAA (data access arrangement) that converts the modem"s two-wire interface to a four-wire interface (transmit and receive signals). The transmit signal from the laptop through modem is sent through this DAA to a wireless transmitter. The BU wireless receiver receives the wirelessly transmitted signals from MU. These signals are then sent to the DAA interface of the BU and through that to the telephone socket and the telephone network. The reverse path communication of BU to MU is done in a similar manner between the BU transmitter and MU receiver. So once initialization is over, the MU and BU open up a full-duplex wireless chaimel between them for transparently communicating the signals between the telephone exchange and the laptop modem between the MU and the BU.<br>
In the event of multiple MU-BU pairs being present in the same geographic location, the wireless signals may interfere. This interference is prevented by sensing whether there is already a signal present at the given frequency, and shifting the channels to an alternative frequency. This is done during the start-up phase.<br>
The other functional blocks on the MU and BU are described below.<br>
Hook Detect Block<br>
The hook detect block detects the laptop modem changing its status and signals the controller regarding the same. The hook detection is carried out by feeding a current into the laptop modem through a current source. When the laptop modem goes off-hook, the current loop is completed and is sensed by the Hook Detect Block that signals the controller.<br><br>
Parallel Phone Off-Hook Detection Block<br>
The BU also contains a parallel phone off-hook detection block that detects if a phone is already off-hook. As per the signaling defined earlier, the MU goes off-hook and signals the BU to go off-hook. The BU upon going off-hook senses whether a dial-tone exists. If not, it assumes that a parallel phone is off-hook and sends a signal to the MU to indicate that the phone line cormected to the BU is already off-hook through a parallel phone. MU then indicates the same to the user. As a result, the user can take necessary action of trying after sometime.<br>
Tone Detection<br>
Tone detection is carried out through a novel cost-effective manner and is shown in Figure 6. Initially when the MU in on-hook, a tone fl is sent firom MU to BU through the wireless transceiver. The BU detects this tone using a novel firequency counter that is robust to noise. In this frequency counter the received signal is first passed through a saturation amplifier that clamps the received signal. This output is then passed through a Schmitt trigger. The Schmitt trigger levels are adjusted so that the Schmitt does not trigger to noise and only to output. This allows for a high level of tolerance to noise. The Schmitt output is then passed to a frequency counter that counts the number of pulses for a given duration to determine the frequency.<br>
Authentication<br>
The adaptors can make to work only with each other by configuring them for recognizing a sequence of tones that are sent by the MU to the BU and by the BU to the MU after initial start-up. The MU and BU are pre-configured to receive a certain sequence of tones. The tone detection at the MU and BU is carried out using the scheme outlined earlier in section on Tone Detection.<br>
System Battery Low Indication<br>
A novel system battery low indication is implemented in this invention. This is explained in Figure 3. Since the battery low indication needs to be provided at the end that is closer to the user, it is provided on the MU. However, since the battery at the BU may go low independent of the MU battery, a novel system battery low indication is provided. If the BU battery goes low, the BU controller sends a battery-low tone, to<br><br>
the MU through the wireless channel, and the MU controller detects this tone using a method similar to that used by the BU for detecting on-hook/off-hook. Upon detection of this signal, the MU indicates to the user through a Light-Emitting-Diodc (LED) or a buzzer, that the battery has gone low. If the MU battery goes low. the controller acts in a similar way.<br>
Power IVIanagcmcnt<br>
The NVJ a.iu QU units can run eithei un battery power or through a power adaptor. The MU and BU systems have a novel power saving feature that allows for the power consumption to be minimized when the data connection is not being used. This is shown in<br>
Figure 2 and Figure 3. When the MU is on-hook, the transmitter and receiver of the MU and the transmitter of the BU are switched off As soon as the MU goes off-hook, the controller senses the off-hook and switches the MU transmitter and receiver on. Since the main power consumption is by the transmitter and receiver, this helps in saving power when the system is not being used. Upon the BU getting the off-hook signal, it switches its transmitter on. As soon as the MU goes on-hook again, the MU transmitter and receiver switch off Upon the BU getting the off-hook signal from the MU, the BU also switches off its transmitter.<br>
Charging<br>
The battery charging arrangement is shown in Figure 7 below. The charging of the MU battery is done through the BU power circuit. Both the MU and BU battery are charged through the BU power circuit. However, optionally, as shown in Figure 7, the MU battery can also be charged from the USB port of a PC or Laptop.<br>
For charging of the batteries, the adaptors can be charged separately, or they can be plugged together for charging together which brings the battery of one adaptor in series with that of the other.<br>
MU and BU Locking for Easy Carrying<br>
The locking of the MU into the BU also allows for the MU and BU to be carried<br>
together, thus making it easier for the user to carry the product. Further, the BU<br>
cavity that houses the MU RJ-11 jack provides for a protection for the jack to prevent<br>
accidental breakage due to it bein^ dropped down.		<br><br>
Flexible Neck<br>
The "mobile unit" assembly has been configured with a flexible contact to the RJll jack. The feature enhances the safety of the RJl 1 jack from breakage, as the load is transferred on the flexible neck, thus preventing strain on the jack when in a plugged-in state. This safety aspect is critical as usage parameters of the laptop are diverse, from work environments that are static and dynamic. This feature is injection molded in a soft plastic - primarily polyurethane. The neck is assembled into a hard plastic body housing the electronic circuitry.<br>
Swivel Feature<br>
A swivel feature has been incorporated in the neck of the mobile unit to provide a 360-degree rotational freedom to the RJII jack. This allows for ease in accessing a range of plug-in orientations prevalent in laptops. The swivel feature with flexible neck is shown in Figure 8.<br>
On/off Switch<br>
The integration of a switch in the RJl 1 jack is a unique feature that allows for activation (on/off) only when the jack is being plugged in or removed. This allows for no secondary operation by the user to initiate the usage of device apart from the unit being plugged in. The RJl 1 jack with micro switch is shown in Figure 9.<br>
Out-of-Range Indicator<br>
There is an out-of-range indicator provided on the MU to indicate whether the BU received signal strength is below a threshold and therefore the systems may not connect.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The product concept is novel, as there does not exist a product that exactly replaces a telephone wire in its functionality. There exists no single solution that can address all the applications where a telephone wire is used, such as voice, PC-PC without using a PSTN network, and computer/fax communication to a network using a PSTN network. The following are the individual novel aspects of the invention:<br><br>
1.	The integration of the different blocks to provide the above functionality of replacement of a telephone wire by a wireless adaptor is unique. The integration is done in a manner that all blocks on the MU and BU are similar, other than the Hook Detect block on the MU and the relay switch on the BU. This allows for easier manufacturability and thus lower cost.<br>
2.	An analog security feature is provided which allows for a low cost solution for locking the two units together. This is done through a sequence of tones where the sequence is coded inside the respective units and only when a match exists is the authentication completed.<br>
3.	A removable analog security feature such that the units can be used completely interchangeably providing for easy use in a home environment.<br>
4.	A system battery low indication that lights up on the MU to indicate that either the MU or the BU battery is low. If the BU battery is low, it sends a signal to the MU which the MU uses to indicate system battery low.<br>
5.	An in-band tone based signaling scheme between the MU and BU that is used for communicating the status of the MU to the BU and vice versa.<br>
6.	A novel cost-effective tone detection scheme that does not use in-expensive controllers to carry out signal processing for tone detection.<br>
7.	An out-of-range indicator that indicates that the MU and BU are out-of-range.<br>
8.	A power management feature that based on user going off-hook powers up the MU transmitter and receiver and BU transmitter, and when the user is on-hook it powers down all the transmitters and receivers other than the BU receiver.<br>
9.	A novel power adaptor that allows a computer user of the product to take power from the USB port of the laptop or PC.<br>
10.	A single charging feature which allows both the MU and BU battery to be charged through one power supply.<br>
11.	The same design of the adaptor can be easily enhanced to work for ADSL connections by using a higher bandwidth DAA and wireless transceiver.<br><br>
12.	The same design of the adaptor can be easily enhanced to work for Cable modems.<br>
13.	The same design of the adaptor can be easily enhanced to work for Ethernet.<br>
14.	Either of the blocks in the MU and BU can be implemented in software or hardware or through embedded software running on hardware.<br>
15.	The adaptor is designed with a flexible contact to the RJl 1 jack. This allows for enhanced safety for the user under various use scenarios.<br>
16.	A swivel feature has been incorporated in the neck of the mobile unit to provide a 360-degree rotational freedom to the RJl 1 jack.<br><br>
17.	A retractable cable assembly in the BU that allows for the BU unit to be placed in a convenient location depending upon the location of the RJ-11 wall socket.<br>
18.	The integration of a switch in the RJl 1 jack is a unique feature that allows for activation (on/off) only when the jack is being plugged in or removed. This allows for no secondary operation by the user to initiate the usage of device apart from the unit being plugged in.<br>
19.	An alternative design for the MU in which there is no switch used and the action of going off-hook powers up the complete system. This is implemented by detecting when the circuit goes off-hook and using that to power-on the complete MU system. This allows for the switch to be completely eliminated on the MU side.<br>
