The above properties of Ranitidine give prominent effect when it is formulated as effervescent tablet containing Domperidone and in physiologically acceptable acid media.<br>
The process for the preparation of effervescent tablets Ranitidine HC1 with Domperidone is given below. Step 1:        Preparation of effervescent granules:<br>
Disodium Hydrogen citrate 2148 gm/unit dose, Sodium Bicarbonate 1100 gm/unit dose and Sodium Saccharine 30 gm/unit<br>
7<br><br>
dose are altogether passed through 40# mesh and mixed in the mixer. Finally effervescent granules are prepared. Step 2:Preparing a binder solution: -<br>
Preparing a binder solution of Polyvinylpyrrolidone. 5% Polyvinyipyrrolidoie (PVP K-30) 50 gm/unit dose is taken and made a solution in Isopropyl alcohol 1200 ml/unit dose solvent. Step-3: Preparing wet effervescent granules:-<br>
Effervescent granules obtained from the above step-1 are mixed with the binder solution obtained from step-2. These wet granules are passed through 16# mesh. These wet granules are dried in tray dryer. Finally dry effervescent granules are prepared. Step-4: Mixing of other excepients with effervescent granules: -<br>
Dry flavour 10 gm/unit dose and Sodium Benzoate 42 gm/unit dose are passed through 100# mesh. These flavoured granules are mixed with Simethicon 4.5 gm/unit dose. Flavoured granules containing Sodium Benzoate and Simethicon are admixed with granules obtained from step-3.<br>
8<br><br>
Step-5: Preparing granules of active ingredients: -<br>
Mixing the active ingredients Ranitidine HCI 167.5 mg/unit dose and Domperidone 10 mg/unit dose. This mixture is passed through 4G# mesh. The granules prepared are mixed with the flavour, to mask its bitter taste.<br>
The granules prepared, are admixed with granules obtained from step-4. Mix well the granules. Pack these granules in double layer polyethylene bag and putted in plastic drum with airtight seal.<br>
Ranitidine Hydrochloride is an active ingredient &amp; H2-receptor   antagonist,   was   mixed   with   an   active   ingredient Domperidone. Step-5: Preparing granules of active ingredients: -<br>
Granules obtained from step-4 are compressed into tablet form. These effervescent tablets of Ranitidine HCl with Domperidone are packed in Aluminium strip &amp; sealed under controlled temperature &amp; humidity. This ensures that the product (tablet) will remain stable until utilized by the consumer.<br>
For the preparation of effervescent tablets according to the present invention requires active and inactive ingredients; and other<br>
9<br><br>
excipients, conventional to the art such as fillers, binders, diluent, lubricants, sweetening agents and/or flavourant.<br>
In the process of preparation of effervescent tablets comprising Ranitidine Hydrochloride with Domperidone, Ranitidine is active ingredient and H2-receptor antagonist have antacid effect, pharmaceutically accepted compound of alkaline nature and being able as for example as Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acidity. Domperidone is a potent Dopamine Receptor antagonist with antiemetic action.<br>
Sweetening agent as Sodium Saccharine is used in the present invention to impart its delicious taste into tablet and mask bitter taste of it. Most suitably Sodium Bicarbonate, Disodium hydrogen citrate are used as the effervescent base components. Mixing of Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHC03), in tablet formulation, produce C02 gas at the time of dispersion of tablet in drinking water and also in the presence of Disodium hydrogen citrate. When Disodium hydrogen citrate present in tablet formulation, the tablet gets easily engulfed by bubbles of carbon dioxide (C02) produced,<br>
10<br><br>
thus lowering the effective density of the tablet and easily gets dissolved in dispersion medium.<br>
The binder Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in iso-propyl alcohol, to bind the whole mass of active and inactive ingredients during granulation process in tablet formulation. It also forms a protective layer on granules and protects it from the environmental condition and also imparts the stability to the product.<br>
Simethicon is used as lubricant, to give smoothness to tablets. Dry flavourant added in the granulation process imparts its colour and taste. All these ingredients are added as per the stability of the tablet &amp; taste requirement.<br>
It is important that the final product should have a high degree of stability; Ranitidine and its HC1 salt are unstable in the presence of moisture and elevated temperature. When Ranitidine is granulated along with the other excipients, and then subjected to drying, it is likely to give stability problems. Therefore, effervescent granules comprising Disodium hydrogen citrate, sodium bicarbonate, a binding agent and one or more of the other<br>
11<br><br>
excipients, such as sweeteners, are first formed into effervescent granules and then dried.<br>
In invented process for preparation of effervescent tablet: two form of granules are prepared, one which is by using effervescent base Disodium hydrogen citrate, Sodium bicarbonate and the other is of using active ingredients Ranitidine HCl and Domperidone. This is to prevent instability of the tablet and to prevent inter reaction the chemicals during the granulation process.<br>
12<br><br>
For Maintenance therapy: Ranitidine 150 mg<br>
The above properties of Ranitidine give prominent effect when it is formulated as effervescent tablet containing Domperidone and in physiologically acceptable acid media.<br>
The   process   for   the   preparation   of  effervescent   tablets Ranitidine HC1 with Domperidone is given below. Step 1:        Preparation of effervescent granules:<br>

Disodium   Hydrogen   citrate   2148   gm/unit   dose,   Sodium Bicarbonate 1100 gm/unit dose and Sodium Saccharine 30 gm/unit dose are altogether passed through 40# mesh and mixed in the mixer. Finally effervescent granules are prepared. Step 2:Preparing a binder solution: -<br>
Preparing   a   binder   solution   of  Polyvinylpyrrolidone.   5% Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K-30) 50 gm/unit dose is taken and made a solution in Isopropyl alcohol 1200 ml/unit dose solvent. Step-3: Preparing wet effervescent granules:-<br>
Effervescent granules obtained from the above step-1 are mixed with the binder solution obtained from step-2. These wet granules are passed through 16# mesh. These wet granules are dried in tray dryer. Finally dry effervescent granules are prepared.<br>
9<br><br>
Step-4: Mixing of other excepients with effervescent granules: -<br>
Dry flavour 10 gm/unit dose and Sodium Benzoate 42 gm/unit dose are passed through 100# mesh. These flavoured granules are mixed with Simethicon 4.5 gm/unit dose. Flavoured granules containing Sodium Benzoate and Simethicon are admixed with granules obtained from step-3. Step-5: Preparing granules of active ingredients: -<br>
Mixing the active ingredients Ranitidine HCl 167.5 mg/unit dose and Domperidone 10 mg/unit dose. This mixture is passed through 40# mesh. The granules prepared are mixed with the flavour, to mask its bitter taste.<br>
The granules prepared, are admixed with granules obtained from step-4. Mix well the granules. Pack these granules in double layer polyethylene bag and putted in plastic drum with airtight seal.<br>
Ranitidine Hydrochloride is an active ingredient &amp; H2-receptor antagonist, was mixed with an active ingredient Domperidone. Step-6: Preparing tablet form active ingredients granules: -<br>
Granules obtained from step-4 are compressed into tablet form. These effervescent tablets of Ranitidine HCl with Domperidone are packed in Aluminium strip &amp; sealed under controlled temperature &amp;<br>
10<br><br>
humidity control at pH level 5.0 to 6.5. This ensures that the product (tablet) will remain stable until utilized by the consumer.<br>
For the preparation of effervescent tablets according to the present invention requires active and inactive ingredients; and other excipients, conventional to the art such as fillers, binders, diluent, lubricants, sweetening agents and/or flavourant.<br>
In the process of preparation of effervescent tablets comprising Ranitidine Hydrochloride with Domperidone, Ranitidine is active ingredient and H2-receptor antagonist have antacid effect, pharmaceutically accepted compound of alkaline nature and being able as for example as Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acidity. Domperidone is a potent Dopamine receptor antagonist with antiemetic action.<br>
Sweetening agent as Sodium Saccharine is used in the present invention to impart its delicious taste into tablet and mask bitter taste of it. Most suitably Sodium Bicarbonate, Disodium hydrogen citrate are used as the effervescent base components. Mixing of Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3), in tablet formulation, produce CO2 gas at the time of dispersion of tablet in drinking water and also in the presence of Disodium hydrogen citrate. When Disodium hydrogen citrate<br>
11<br><br>
present in tablet formulation, the tablet gets easily engulfed by bubbles of carbon dioxide (C02) produced, thus lowering the effective density of the tablet and easily gets dissolved in dispersion medium.<br>
The binder Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in iso-propyl alcohol, to bind the whole mass of active and inactive ingredients during granulation process in tablet formulation. It also forms a protective layer on granules and protects it from the environmental condition and also imparts the stability to the product.<br>
Simethicon is used as lubricant, to give smoothness to tablets. Dry flavourant added in the granulation process imparts its colour and taste. All these ingredients are added as per the stability of the tablet &amp; taste requirement.<br>
It is important that the final product should have a high degree of stability; Ranitidine and its HCl salt are unstable in the presence of moisture and elevated temperature. When Ranitidine is granulated along with the other excipients, and then subjected to drying, it is likely to give stability problems. Therefore, effervescent granules comprising Disodium hydrogen citrate, sodium bicarbonate, a binding agent and one or more of the other<br>
12<br><br>
excipients, such as sweeteners, are first formed into effervescent granules and then dried.<br>
In invented process for preparation of effervescent tablet: two form of granules are prepared, one which is by using effervescent base Disodium hydrogen citrate, Sodium bicarbonate and the other is of using active ingredients Ranitidine HC1 and Domperidone. This is to prevent instability of the tablet and to prevent inter reaction the chemicals during the granulation process.<br>
