RECORDING MEDIUM, PLAYBACK DEVICE, RECORDING METHOD,<br>
PLAYBACK METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to recording media such<br>
as BD-ROMs for distributing movie works and playback devices<br>
for playing such recording media, and in particular to<br>
improving the way in which movie works that realize dynamic<br>
playback controls are provided.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the retail of DVD-ROMs and BD-ROMs, the greater<br>
the number of variations of a movie work (title) that can<br>
be sold on a single disk, the greater the added value of the<br>
product. Scenario data called static scenarios and dynamic<br>
scenarios plays a positive role in increasing the number of<br>
title variations. A static scenario is information showing<br>
a playback path defined in advance by a disk creator. In<br>
comparison, a dynamic scenario is a scenario that dynamically<br>
changes the progress of playback according to a status<br>
setting of the device.<br>
Figs.1A-1C show a dynamic scenario. The dynamic<br>
scenario realizes a "language credit" for switching playback<br>
scenes according to a language setting in the playback device.<br><br>
In Figs . 1A-1C, "PL" is short for PlayList, which is a playback<br>
path, and "PI" is short for PlayItem, which is a playback<br>
section. The dynamic scenario in Figs., 1A-1C realizes<br>
conditional playback such that if the language setting<br>
(SPRM(0)) in the playback device is "Japanese" (i.e.<br>
"if (SPRM(0) )==Japanese") , playback section PI#1 of playback<br>
path PL#4 (PL#4, PI#1) is played, and if the language setting<br>
in the playback device is other than PL#4 (i.e. "else"),<br>
playback section PI#1 of playback path PL#2 (PL#2, PI#1) is<br>
played. As a result of this conditional playback, playback<br>
is performed via playback paths that differ depending on the<br>
language setting made by the user. The arrows hb1 and hb2<br>
in Fig.1B symbolically show the conditional branching that<br>
results from a dynamic scenario. The prior art relating to<br>
DVD playback controls includes the known technology<br>
disclosed in Japanese patent application no. 28563 63.<br>
However, if the user conducts a menu call while the<br>
playback device is executing a playback control in accordance<br>
with an internal status setting, there is a danger that the<br>
status setting of the playback device will be altered. A menu<br>
call is an on-demand type branch for branching to a<br>
status-setting routine in the playback device triggered by<br>
the user depressing a menu key. Being a call rather than a<br>
jump, the menu call follows processing (1) for saving a value<br>
held in a register of the playback device prior to the<br><br>
execution of the status-setting routine, and. follows<br>
processing (2) for restoring the saved value to the register<br>
after the execution of the status-setting routine.<br>
Register-held values that are saved and restored show the<br>
current point in time of playback. As such, even if the user<br>
requests a menu call in the middle of a playback path, thereby<br>
initiating a status-setting routine, playback is resumed<br>
from immediately after the previous playback position once<br>
the status-setting routine has ended.<br>
In the example given here, the language setting in the<br>
playback device is English, and the playback time in<br>
Figs.1A-1C is over PL#2, which is the playback path<br>
specifically for English. If a menu call is conducted in the<br>
above state and the status setting in the playback device<br>
is updated from English to Japanese, the playback device<br>
loses the position for resuming playback. This is because<br>
it does not make sense to resume playback on the English<br>
language playback path when the language setting has changed<br>
from English to Japanese as a result of the menu call. Also,<br>
the setting of a meaningless playback position risks inviting<br>
a hang up when software is implemented in the playback device .<br>
These difficulties can be avoided by uniformly<br>
prohibiting menu calls. However, when a number of versions<br>
of a movie work are recorded on a aingle optical disk, it<br>
is fully conceivable that a title that does not execute<br><br><br>
language credits is recorded on the optical disk. Uniformly<br>
preventing menu calls during the playback of titles shows<br>
a lack of consideration to the user.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
recording medium capable of executing menu calls in response<br>
to the particular characteristics of individual titles when<br>
different versions of a movie work are recorded on a single<br>
recording medium.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A recording medium provided to achieve the above object<br>
has video data and a dynamic scenario recorded thereon, the<br>
dynamic scenario being a command string showing a playback<br>
control procedure of the video data and having attribute<br>
information appended thereto, the attribute information<br>
showing a control procedure for when a user requests a menu<br>
call during playback of the video data and including a first<br>
flag, and the first flag indicating, when the menu call ends<br>
during playback of the video data, whether to resume playback<br>
of the video data from the playback position at the time that<br>
the menu call was requested.<br>
According to this structure, control procedures<br>
relating to menu calls are set at a dynamic scenario level,<br>
which is the highest layer in a layer model comprising, from<br>
bottom to top, streams, playback paths, and dynamic scenarios.<br><br>
When a title that the creator particularly wants to create<br>
realizes a language credit, controls can be performed to<br>
accept requests for menu calls without resuming playback.<br>
As a result, titles can be easily divided into two types even<br>
when the streams and playback paths are the same; namely,<br>
titles with respect to which menu calls are permitted, and<br>
titles with respect to which menu calls are prohibited. With<br>
the creation of titles, the number of variations having<br>
different control procedures can be increased with little<br>
effort, since there is no increase the number of playback<br>
paths or streams.<br>
Japanese patent application no. 2856363 discloses<br>
technology for setting the permissibility of user operations<br>
based on stream levels and playback paths. According to the<br>
disclosed technology, dividing titles into those with<br>
respect to which menu calls are either permitted or<br>
prohibited would result in an indiscriminate increase the<br>
number of streams and playback paths because of the<br>
permissibility of user operations being set based on stream<br>
levels and playback paths. In contrast, with the present<br>
invention, there is no increase in the number of streams and<br>
playback paths, because the permissibility of playback<br>
resumption after completion of a menu call is set at a dynamic<br>
scenario level. Since there is little if any increase in the<br>
number of streams and playback paths, it is possible<br><br>
according the present invention to prevent errors such as<br>
titles with respect to which menu calls should be permitted<br>
being confused with titles with respect to which menu calls<br>
are prohibited.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
An embodiment of a recording medium pertaining to the<br>
present invention is described below. Firstly, a usage act<br>
is described in relation to the implementation of a recording<br>
medium pertaining to the present invention. Fig.2 shows a<br>
usage act of a recording medium pertaining to the present<br>
invention. BD-ROM 100 in Fig.2 is a recording medium<br><br>
pertaining to the present invention. BD-ROM 100 is used to<br>
supply movie works in a home theater system formed from a<br>
playback device 200, a television 300, and a remote<br>
controller 400.<br>
Next, a production act is described in relation to the<br>
implementation of a recording medium pertaining to the<br>
present invention. A recording medium pertaining to the<br>
present invention can be implemented as a result of<br>
enhancements in the application layer of BD-ROMs. Fig. 3 shows<br>
the structure of a BD-ROM.<br>
Level 4 in Fig.3 shows a BD-ROM, and the third level<br>
shows a track on the BD-ROM. The track at level 3 depicts,<br>
in a laterally drawn-out form, the tracks spiraling from the<br>
inside to the outside of the BD-ROM. These tracks are formed<br>
from a lead-in area, a volume area, and a lead-out area. The<br>
volume area in Fig. 3 has a layer model consisting of a physical<br>
layer, a filesystem layer, and an application layer. A<br>
recording medium pertaining to the present invention is<br>
industrially manufactured by forming the data format shown<br>
in Fig.3 on the application layer of a BD-ROM.<br>
Fig. 4 expresses an application layer format<br>
(hereinafter, simply "application format") of a BD-ROM using<br>
a directory structure. As shown in Fig.4, below a ROOT<br>
directory in the BD-ROM is a BDMV directory, and below the<br>
BDMV directory is a JCLASS directory and a BROWSER directory.<br><br>
Subordinate to the BDMV directory exist the following files:<br>
INFO.BD, XXX.M2TS, XXX.CLPI, YYY.MPLS, and ZZZ.MOVIE.<br>
Subordinate to the JCLASS directory is disposed ZZZ.CLASS,<br>
and subordinate to the BROWSER directory is disposed ZZZ.HTM.<br>
Fig.5 is a classification diagram of when these files<br>
are classified from a functionality viewpoint. In Fig.5, the<br>
hierarchy formed from the first, second, third and fourth<br>
layers symbolically shows the classifications in the diagram.<br>
In Fig.5, XXX.M2TS is grouped in the second layer. XXX.CLPI<br>
and YYY.MPLS are grouped in the third layer (static<br>
scenarios) . ZZZ.MOVIE, which is subordinate to the BDMV<br>
directory, ZZZ.CLASS, which is subordinate to the JCLASS<br>
directory, and ZZZ.HTM, which is subordinate to the BROWSER<br>
directory, are grouped in the fourth layer.<br>
The classifications in Fig.5 (first to fourth layers)<br>
target a layer model such as shown in Fig.6. A layer model<br>
in control software that targets a BD-ROM is described below<br>
while referring to Fig.6.<br>
The first layer in Fig.6 is a physical layer in which<br>
supply controls relating to streams targeted for processing<br>
are implemented. As shown in the first layer, target streams<br>
have as their supply source not only BD-ROMs but also HDDs<br>
(hard disk drives) , memory cards, networks and other kinds<br>
of recording and communication media. Controls (disk access,<br>
card access, network communication) directed towards these<br><br>
HDDs, memory cards, and networks are implemented on the first<br>
layer.<br>
The second layer is a decoding format layer. This second<br>
layer is where the decoding format used in decoding streams<br>
supplied by the first layer is defined. The MPEG-2 decoding<br>
format is employed in the present embodiment.<br>
The third layer (static scenarios) defines the static<br>
scenarios of streams. Static scenarios are playback path<br>
information and Clip information defined in advance by the<br>
disk creator, the third layer (static scenarios) being where<br>
playback controls based on these static scenarios are<br>
defined.<br>
The fourth layer is for realizing dynamic scenarios in<br>
streams. Dynamic scenarios are scenarios for dynamically<br>
changing the progress of playback as a result of user<br>
operations, the device status, and the like, the fourth layer<br>
being where playback controls based on these dynamic<br>
scenarios are defined. Files relating to streams, static<br>
scenarios, and dynamic scenarios are described below in<br>
accordance with this layer model.<br>
Firstly, an AVClip (XXX.M2TS) belonging to the second<br>
layer is described.<br>
AVClip (XXX.M2TS) is an MPEG-TS (transport stream)<br>
format digital stream obtained by multiplexing a video stream,<br>
one or more audio streams, and one or more graphics streams,<br><br>
being presentation graphics streams and interactive graphics<br>
streams. Video streams show the moving image portions of a<br>
movie, audio streams show the audio portions of a movie,<br>
presentation graphics streams show the subtitles of a movie,<br>
and interactive graphics streams show procedures involved<br>
in dynamic playback controls that target menus. Fig.7<br>
schematically shows how an AVClip is constituted.<br>
An AVClip (4th level) is formed by converting a video<br>
stream comprising a plurality of video frames (pictures pj1,<br>
Pj2, Pj3) and an audio stream comprising a plurality of audio<br>
frames (1st level) into a PES packet string (2nd level) , which<br>
is then converted to TS packets (3rd level). Likewise, a<br>
subtitle-related presentation graphics stream and a<br>
dialogue-related interactive graphics stream (7th level) are<br>
converted to a PES packet string (6th level), which is<br>
converted to TS packets (5th level) , and the TS packets are<br>
then multiplexed. The multiplexing involves arranging TS<br>
packets storing video frames and TS packets storing audio<br>
frames so that audio frames are positioned close to video<br>
frames that are to be read from the BD-ROM at the same time<br>
as the audio frames.<br>
AVClips generated though the above process are<br>
portioned into a plurality of extents and recorded in an area<br>
of a BD-ROM, as is the case with normal computer programs.<br>
An AVClip comprises one or more ACCESS UNITs, and can be cued<br><br>
in these ACCESS UNITs . An ACCESS UNIT is the smallest decoding<br>
unit that includes a single GOP (group of pictures) and audio<br>
frames to be read at the same time as the GOP. GOPs include<br>
bi-directionally predictive (B) pictures, which are<br>
compressed using time-correlation characteristics with<br>
images to be played in a past direction and a future direction,<br>
predictive (P) pictures, which are compressed using<br>
time-correlation characteristics with images to be played<br>
in a past direction, and intra (I) pictures, which are<br>
compressed using frequency-correlation characteristics (i.e.<br>
not time-correlation characteristics) in the images of<br>
individual frames.<br>
Moreover, the filename "XXX" in XXX.M2TS abstracts the<br>
3-digit identification number appended to the AVClip in the<br>
BD-ROM. That is, the AVClip in Fig.7 is uniquely identified<br>
using the "XXX". Thus completes the description of the stream<br>
(XXX.M2TS). It should be noted that the 3-digit number<br>
referred to here is merely exemplary, and may be any length.<br>
Static Scenarios<br>
Static scenarios files (XXX.CLPI, YYY.MPLS) are<br>
described below.<br>
Clip information (XXX.CLPI) is management information<br>
relating to individual AVClips. Fig.8 shows an internal<br>
structure of Clip information. AVClips are obtained by<br><br><br>
multiplexing video and audio streams, and since AVClips can<br>
be cued in ACCESS UNITs, management items of the Clip<br>
information include the attributes of the video and audio<br>
streams and where the cue positions are in the AVClips . The<br>
leaders in Fig.8 highlight the Clip information structure.<br>
As shown by the leader hn1, Clip information (XXX.CPLI)<br>
comprises "attribute information" relating to video and<br>
audio streams and "EP_map", which is reference table for<br>
cueing ACCESS UNITs.<br>
Attribute information (Attribute), as shown by the<br>
leader hn2, comprises attribute information relating to a<br>
video stream (Video attribute information), an attribute<br>
information number (Number), and attribute information<br>
relating to each of a plurality of audio streams multiplexed<br>
on the AVClip (Audio attribute information #l-#m) . The Video<br>
attribute information, as shown by the leader hn3, indicates<br>
the compression format used to compress the video stream<br>
(Coding), and the resolution (Resolution), aspect ratio<br>
(Aspect) and frame rate (Framerate) of individual pieces of<br>
picture data structuring the video stream.<br>
On the other hand, Audio attribute information #l-#m<br>
relating to the audio stream, as shown by the leader hn4,<br>
indicates the compression format used to compress the<br>
respective audio streams (Coding), and the channel number<br>
(Ch.) and corresponding language (Lang.) of respective audio<br><br><br>
streams.<br>
EP_map is a reference table for referring indirectly<br>
to the addresses of a plurality of cue positions using time<br>
information, and, as shown by the leader hrv.5, comprises<br>
plural pieces of entry information {ACCESS UNIT#1 entry,<br>
ACCESS DNIT#2 entry, ACCESS UNIT#3 entry, ...) and an entry<br>
number (Number). Each entry, as shown by the leader hn6,<br>
indicates a playback start time of a corresponding ACCESS<br>
UNIT in correspondence with an address and the size (I-size)<br>
of the head I-picture in the ACCESS UNIT. The playback start<br>
time of an ACCESS UNIT is expressed as a times tamp<br>
(presentation timestamp) of picture data positioned at the<br>
head of the ACCESS UNIT. Also, the addresses in the ACCESS<br>
UNITS are expressed by the serial numbers of TS packets<br>
(Source Packet Number or "SPN"). Since a variable-length<br>
coding compression format is employed, it is possible to cue<br>
from an arbitrary playback time to a piece of picture data<br>
in an ACCESS UNIT corresponding to the playback time by<br>
referring to the entry of the ACCESS UNIT, even when sizes<br>
and playback times of ACCESS UNITs that include GOPs are not<br>
uniform. Moreover, the filename "XXX" of XXX.CPLI uses the<br>
same name as the AVClip to which the Clip information<br>
corresponds. In other words, the filename of the Clip<br>
information in Fig.8, being "XXX", corresponds to AVClip<br>
 (XXX.M2TS). Thus concludes the description of Clip<br><br>
information. Playlist information is described next.<br>
YYY.MPLS (PlayList information) is a table structuring<br>
a PlayList, which is playback path information, and comprises<br>
plural pieces of PlayItem information (PlayItem information<br>
#1, #2, #3, ..., #n), and a PlayItem information number (Number) .<br>
Fig. 9 shows an internal structure of PL information. PlayItem<br>
information is pointer information that defines one or more<br>
playback logical sections structuring a PlayList. The<br>
structure of PlayItem information is highlighted by the<br>
leader hs1. PlayItem information is, as shown by the leader<br>
hs1, structured from a "Clip_information_filename"<br>
indicating the filename of playback section information<br>
relating to an AVClip to which the In-point and Out-point<br>
of a playback section belong, a "Clip_codec_identifier"<br>
showing the encoding format used to encode the AVClip, an<br>
"In_time", which is time information showing the start of<br>
a playback section, and an "Out__time", which is time<br>
information showing the end of a playback section.<br>
A characteristic of PlayItem information is the<br>
notation. That is, playback sections are defined by an<br>
indirect referencing format that uses an EP_map as a<br>
reference table. Fig.10 schematizes indirect referencing<br>
using PL information. The AVClip in Fig.10 is structured from<br>
a plurality of ACCESS UNITs. The EP_map in the Clip<br>
information specifies the sector addresses of the ACCESS<br><br><br>
UNITs, as shown by the arrows ay1, ay2, ay3 and ay4. Arrows<br>
jy1, Jy2, Jy3 and Jy4 in Fig.10 schematically show the<br>
referencing of ACCESS UNITs using PlayItem information. In<br>
other words, this shows that referencing by PlayItem<br>
information (jy1, jy2, jy3, jy4) involves indirect<br>
referencing in which the addresses of ACCESS UNITs included<br>
in the AVClip are specified via the EP_map.<br>
Playback sections on BD-ROM formed from groupings of<br>
PlayItem information, Clip information and AVClips are<br>
called "PlayItems". Playback units on a BD-ROM that are<br>
formed from groupings of PL information, Clip information<br>
and AVClips are called "PlayLists" (abbreviated as "PL").<br>
Movie works recorded on a BD-ROM are structured in these<br>
logical playback units (PLs) . Since movie works on a BD-ROM<br>
are structured in logical playback units, it is possible to<br>
easily create, as distinct from the main movie work, movie<br>
works from scenes in which only certain characters appear,<br>
for instance, by defining the PLs specifying these scenes.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an example of when a different PL (PL information<br>
#2) to the PL (PL information #1) shown in Fig.lO is defined.<br>
The greatest merit of static scenarios is being able<br>
to increase the range of a moviemaker's expression, since<br>
the variations of a movie work increase simply by defining<br>
different pieces of PL information.<br>
There are, in addition to PLs and PlayItems, playback<br><br><br>
units in BD-ROM called Chapters . Chapters are structured from<br>
one, two, or more PlayItems.<br>
Also, the filename "YYY" of PL information abstracts<br>
the 3-digit identification number appended to PL information<br>
in BD-ROM. That is, the PL information in Fig. 11 is uniquely<br>
identified using the identification number YYY. Expressing<br>
the identification number of PL information as "YYY" shows<br>
that this identification number is a different numbering<br>
system to the identification number XXX of the AVClip and<br>
Clip information (the 3-digit number used here is merely<br>
exemplary, and may be any number of digits) .<br>
Thus concludes the description of static scenarios.<br>
Dynamic scenarios are described next.<br>
Dynamic Scenarios<br>
Dynamic scenarios are command strings showing dynamic<br>
playback control procedures relating to AVClips. Dynamic<br>
playback control procedures change in response to user<br>
operations with respect to a device, and are similar to<br>
computer programs in character. Here, dyneimic playback<br>
controls have two modes. One of the two modes is for playing<br>
video data recorded on BD-ROM (normal mode) and the other<br>
mode is for enhancing the added value of video data recorded<br>
on BD-ROM (enhanced mode) in a playback environment specific<br>
to AV devices . Fig. 12 shows playback modes on the fourth layer<br><br><br>
of the layer model. One normal mode and two enhanced modes<br>
are described on the fourth layer in Fig.12. The normal mode,<br>
called a MOVIE mode, is a playback mode for a DVD-like<br>
environment. Of the two enhanced modes, the first, called<br>
a Java mode, is a playback mode used mainly with Java virtual<br>
machines. The second enhanced mode, called a Browser mode,<br>
is a playback mode used mainly with browsers. Since there<br>
are three modes on the fourth layer (i.e. the MOVIE mode,<br>
Java mode and Browser mode), it is preferable to describe<br>
the modes with which dynamic scenarios can be executed. When<br>
wanting to describe control commands using commands that<br>
closely resemble DVD-oriented commands, MOVIE mode playback<br>
control procedures are preferably described. In this way,<br>
it is possible to have a playback device execute playback<br>
controls that closely resemble those in existing DVD playback<br>
devices. When control procedures are described using a page<br>
description language, Browser mode playback control<br>
procedures are preferably described. As such, it is possible<br>
to describe control procedures for accessing network sites,<br>
downloading files, and the like. ZZZ.CLASS in Fig. 4 is a Java<br>
mode dynamic scenario, ZZZ.HTM is a Browser mode dynamic<br>
scenario, and ZZZ.MOVIE is MOVIE-mode dynamic scenario.<br>
Dynamic Scenarios in MOVIE Mode<br>
The following description relates to dynamic scenarios<br><br><br>
in MOVIE mode. MOVIE objects (ZZZ.MOVIE) are dynamic<br>
scenarios described in commands similar to those used in DVD<br>
playback devices. MOVIE objects consist of playback commands<br>
instructing PL playback, commands to be executed prior to<br>
PL playback (pre-commands), and commands to be executed after<br>
PL playback (post-commands) . Pairings of one or more dynamic<br>
scenarios with PLs whose playback is instructed in the<br>
dynamic scenarios are known as Titles. Titles are units<br>
corresponding to entire movie works on BD-ROM,. It should be<br>
noted that "MOVIE object" is sometimes shortened to "M-OBJ"<br>
below.<br>
Technique for Describing Scenarios<br>
The above dynamic scenarios can be described using<br>
functions supplied from the third layer (static scenarios) .<br>
The following description relates to functions supplied from<br>
the third layer (static scenarios).<br>
(a) Playback Functions: start playback of PlayLists<br>
specified by first arguments from positions specified by<br>
second arguments.<br>
Format: PlayPL {first argument, second argument)<br>
First arguments are able to specify PLs for playback<br>
using the numbers of PlayLists. Second arguments are able<br>
to specif y playback start positions using PlayItems included<br><br><br>
in the PLs, and arbitrary times, Chapters and Marks in the<br>
PLs.<br>
A PlayPL function specifying a playback start position<br>
using a PlayItem is called a "PlayPLatPlayItem() ", a PlayPL<br>
function specifying a playback start position using a Chapter<br>
is called a "PlayPLatChapter()", and a PlayPL function<br>
specifying a playback start position using time information<br>
is called a "PlayPLatSpecified Time()"<br>
(b) Functions for status-acquisition and status setting of<br>
a playback device.<br>
The status of a playback device is shown in 32<br>
individual Player Status Registers (the setting values of<br>
these registers are called System Parameters (SPRM)), and<br>
32 individual General Purpose Registers (the setting values<br>
of these registers are called General Parameters (GPRM)).<br>
MOVIE objects, Java objects, and WebPage objects are<br>
able, for example, to set values in and acquire values from<br>
these registers by using the following functions (i) to (iv) .<br>
(i) "Get value of Player Status Register" Function<br>
Format: Get value of Player Status Register (argument)<br>
This function acquires setting values of Player Status<br>
Registers specified by arguments.<br><br><br>
(ii) "Set value of Player Status Register" Function<br>
Format: Set value of Player Status Register (first<br>
argument, second argument)<br>
This function causes values specified by second<br>
arguments to be set in Player Status Registers specified by<br>
first arguments.<br>
(iii) "Get value of General Purpose Register" Function<br>
Format: Get value of General Purpose Register<br>
(argument)<br>
This function acquires setting values of General<br>
Purpose Registers specified by arguments.<br>
(iv) "Set value of General Purpose Register" Function<br>
Format: Set value of General Purpose Register (first<br>
argument, second argument)<br>
This function causes values specified by second<br>
arguments to be set in General Purpose Registers specified<br>
by first arguments.<br>
The setting values (SPRM) of the Player Status<br>
Registers have the following meanings. The notation<br>
"SPRM(x) " below refers to the setting value of the xth Player<br>
Status Register.<br>
SPRM(0) : Reserved<br><br><br>
SPRM(1) : stream number of audio stream targeted for<br>
decoding<br>
SPRM(2) : stream number of graphics stream targeted<br>
for decoding<br>
SPRM(3) : number showing angle setting by user<br>
SPRM(4) : number of Title currently targeted for<br>
playback<br>
SPRM(5) : number of Chapter currently targeted for<br>
playback<br>
SPRM(6) : number of PL currently targeted for<br>
playback<br>
SPRM(7) : number of PlayItem currently targeted for<br>
playback<br>
SPRM(8) : time information showing current playback<br>
time<br>
SPRM(9) : count value of navigation timer<br>
SPRM(10) : number of button currently in selected<br>
state<br>
SPRM(11)-(12) : Reserved<br>
SPRM(13) : setting of parental level by user<br>
SPRM(14) : setting related to video playback of<br>
playback device<br>
SPRM(15) : setting related to audio playback of<br>
playback device<br>
SPRM(16) : language code showing audio setting in<br><br>
playback device<br>
SPRM(17) : language code showing subtitle setting in<br>
playback device<br>
SPRM(18) : language setting for rendering menu<br>
 SPRM(19)-(31) : Reserved<br>
Of these SPRMs, SPRM(4) is updated when a Title is<br>
selected by a user via a menu operation. SPRMs(5)-(7) are<br>
updated whenever the current playback time moves forward.<br>
That is, SPRM (7) is updated if the current playback time moves<br>
from one PlayItem to another PlayItem, SPRM(6) is updated<br>
if one PL is switched for another PL, and SPRM(5) is updated<br>
if one Chapter is switched for another Chapter.<br>
In this way, the Title and PL being played, as well as<br>
the PlayItem and Chapter being played in the PL are revealed<br>
by referring to SPRMs(4) - (7) .<br>
SPRM(8), which is time information showing the current<br>
playback time (i.e. a point in time), is updated whenever<br>
picture data belonging to an AVClip is displayed. That is,<br>
if a playback device displays new picture data, SPRM(8) is<br>
updated to a value showing the display start time of the new<br>
picture data (Presentation Time).<br>
Java objects and WebPage objects are able to find out<br>
the status of a playback device in detail by referring to<br>
the Player Status Registers using the "Get value of Player<br><br><br>
Status Register" function and the "Get value of General<br>
Purpose Status Register" function.<br>
(c) There also exist branches from one dynamic scenario to<br>
another dynamic scenario, although these are not programming<br>
functions supplied from the third level (static scenarios).<br>
Functions for executing branches from one dynamic scenario<br>
to another dynamic scenario include the following JMP and<br>
CALL functions.<br>
JMP function<br>
Format: JMP Argument<br>
CALL function<br>
Format: CALL Argument<br>
The JMP function is a branch for discarding the current<br>
dynamic scenario during operation, and executing<br>
branch-target dynamic scenario specified by an argument. JMP<br>
commands include direct reference commands that specify<br>
branch-target dynamic scenarios directly, and indirect<br>
reference commands that specify branch-target dynamic<br>
scenarios indirectly.<br>
The Call function is a branch for causing a<br>
branch-target dynamic scenario specified by an argument to<br>
operate after suspending the operation of the current dynamic<br><br><br>
scenario, and then resuming the operation of the suspended<br>
scenario once the branch-target dynamic scenario has ended.<br>
Resume commands are placed at the end of dynamic scenarios<br>
forming the branch-targets of Call commands. Resume commands,<br>
which are the so-called Return commands of subroutines, are<br>
for reactivating dynamic scenarios that are in a suspended<br>
state due to the execution of a Call function. Call commands,<br>
as with JMP commands, include direct reference commands that<br>
specify branch-target dynamic scenarios directly, and<br>
indirect reference commands that specify branch-target<br>
dynamic scenarios indirectly.<br>
Thus concludes the description of functions and<br>
variables supplied by the third layer (static scenario) .<br>
Fig.13 shows the internal structure of a MOVIE object.<br>
A MOVIE object as shown in Fig.13 comprises attribute<br>
information and a command string. The attribute information<br>
comprises a resume_intension_flag, a menu_call_mask, and a<br>
Title_search_mask.<br>
The "resume_intension_flag" shows what controls the<br>
MOVIE object should perform when a menu call is requested.<br>
If the resume_intension_f lag is OFF, a status-setting<br>
routine is called when a user requests a menu call. At this<br>
time, the MOVIE object currently being executed is discarded,<br>
since the resuming operation described above is not performed.<br>
If the current MOVIE object is discarded in the playback<br><br><br>
device, playback by the playback device needs to be restarted.<br>
There are two approaches regarding which playback position<br>
to return when restarting playback. One approach involves<br>
restarting playback from a state in the current MOVIE object<br>
immediately prior to the branching.<br>
The other approach involves restarting playback from<br>
the head of the plurality of commands structuring the current<br>
MOVIE object when the playback device has already executed<br>
some of the commands. Since the former approach involves<br>
complicated processing to recreate the pre-branching state,<br>
the present invention employs the latter approach.<br>
The latter approach to restarting playback is performed<br>
by initializing parameters showing the execution position<br>
of the current MOVIE object and parameters showing the<br>
current playback position. That is, SPRMs(5)-(8) showing the<br>
playback position are initialized when branching to a<br>
status-setting routine as the result of a menu call. If<br>
SPRMs(4)-(8) are saved after the initialization,<br>
SPRMs(4) - (8) can be reset in the original register during<br>
the restore processing performed after the status-setting<br>
routine ends. Since SPRMs(5)-(8) have been initialized, the<br>
playback device restarts playback using the reset values.<br>
On the other hand, if the resume_intension_flag is ON,<br>
a MOVIE object for menu-call usage is jumped to after<br>
suspending the current MOVIE object and saving the SPRMs.<br><br><br>
When processing of the MOVIE object for menu-call usage has<br>
ended, playback using the current MOVIE object is resumed<br>
after restoring the SPRMs. With MOVIE objects that realize<br>
language credits as shown in Figs.1A-1C, the<br>
resume_intension_flag preferably is set to OFF. This is<br>
because if a menu call is requested and the language setting<br>
is changed from English to Japanese when the playback device<br>
is on PL#2, the playback device loses the playback resumption<br>
position.<br>
The creator is able to prevent operational errors<br>
occurring in the playback device when playback is performed<br>
by setting to OFF the resume_intension_flag piece of<br>
attribute information in MOVIE objects where there is a<br>
danger of losing the playback position as described above.<br>
In this way, the creator can feel assured in creating MOVIE<br>
objects that perform playback controls according to SPRM<br>
settings.<br>
Since playback resumptions or restarts using the<br>
resume_intension_flag are possible in MOVIE object units,<br>
creating MOVIE objects comprising one or two commands and<br>
branching these MOVIE objects allows playback resumptions<br>
or restarts to be performed in units of one or two commands.<br>
That is, MOVIE objects preferably are created depending on<br>
the units in which playback resumption or restarting is<br>
executed. Thus concludes the description of the<br><br>
resume_intension_flag.<br>
The "menu_call_mask" is a flag showing whether or not<br>
to mask menu calls. Requests for menu calls by a user are<br>
permitted if this flag is OFF and prohibited if ON.<br>
The "Title_search_mask" is a flag showing whether or<br>
not to mask Title searches. Requests for Title searches by<br>
a user are permitted if this flag is OFF and prohibited if<br>
ON. If the current MOVIE object is for playing a trailer<br>
(preview video) or warning video by the FBI, for instance,<br>
it is possible to make sure that the user views and understands<br>
the content of this video by setting the Title_search_mask<br>
in the MOVIE object to ON.<br>
Specific exemplary setting of the<br>
resume_intension_flag and Title_search_mask are described<br>
below. Figs. 14A-14C show the exemplary description of a MOVIE<br>
object when realizing a language credit and playback controls<br>
resulting from this exemplary description.<br>
In the exemplary MOVIE object description shown in<br>
Fig.14A, resume_intension_flag, menu_call_mask, and<br>
Title_search_mask have been added to the exemplary MOVIE<br>
object description shown in Fig.lA. The<br>
resume_intension_flag, menu_call_maskf and<br>
Title_search_mask have all been set to "0". Fig.14B shows<br>
a playback control based on the MOVIE object described in<br>
Fig.14A. The exemplary description in Fig.14A realizes<br><br>
conditional playback such that PL#4 is played (Link(PL#4,<br>
PI#1)) if the language setting (SPRM(0)) in the playback<br>
device is "Japanese", and PL#2 is played (Link(PL#2, PI#1))<br>
if the language setting in the playback device is anything<br>
other than "Japanese" (i.e. "else"). Here, the playback<br>
device proceeds on PL#2 if the language setting in the<br>
playback device is English.<br>
Assume that the user requests a menu call when the<br>
playback device is on PL#2 (rg1) . In this case, the processing<br>
in Figs.l5A-15C to restart playback is performed because of<br>
the resume_intension_flag in the given MOVIE object being<br>
set to "0". Figs.l5A-15C show processing in the playback<br>
device for restarting playback. If the resume_intension_flag<br>
is set to "0", SPRMs(4) - (8) showing the playback position<br>
are saved to memory (Fig.15B) after initializing<br>
SPRMs(5)-(8) (Fig.15A). A branch br1 to a status-setting<br>
routine rc1 is executed after SPRMs(4)-(8) have been saved.<br>
Assume that the user changes the language setting from<br>
English to Japanese using this status-setting routine<br>
(English—* Japanese in Fig.15B). Once processing of the<br>
status-setting routine has ended, the playback device<br>
restores SPRMs(4)-(8) saved in memory to the register. Since<br>
the initialized SPRMs(5)-(8) showing the playback position<br>
are set in the register, the playback position is set to the<br>
head of the Title in Fig.14B. As a result, restarting from<br><br>
the head of the Title is carried out. Moreover, in the Fig.14C<br>
example, the playback position is set to the Title head<br>
because of the playback device not initializing SPRM(4),<br>
which shows the number of the Title currently being played.<br>
If this Title number is initialized, playback is restarted<br>
from a Title menu that encourages the user to select a Title.<br>
A further exemplary description is shown Figs . 16A-16C.<br>
Figs.16A-16C show the exemplary description of a MOVIE<br>
object when realizing branching that results from a question,<br>
and playback controls resulting from this exemplary<br>
description. The exemplary MOVIE object description shown<br>
in Fig. 16A differs from that shown in Fig.14A in that Fig.16A<br>
realizes dialogue playback controls, whereas Fig. 14 realizes<br>
a language credit. In Fig.16A, PL#1 is a question scene, and<br>
PL#2 and PL#4 are scenes that appear when answers (1) and<br>
(2) are respectively selected in response to the question.<br>
Which answer to select is set in GPRM(0) . Playback switching<br>
resulting from IF statements, is performed according to<br>
GPRM(0) . GPRM(0), which is merely a general-purpose register<br>
value, is not updated in response to the setting of<br>
status-setting routines. Also, in this exemplary description,<br>
resume_intension_flag is set to "1".<br>
Fig.16B shows a playback control based on the MOVIE<br>
object described above.<br>
Assume that the user requests a menu call when the<br><br>
playback device is on PL#2. In this case, the playback device<br>
omits Fig.15A and performs the Fig.15B processing because<br>
of the resume_intension_flag in the given MOVIE object being<br>
set to "1". That is, SPRMs(4)-(8) showing the playback<br>
position are saved from the register to memory. Branch br1<br>
to status-setting routine rc1 is executed after SPRMs(4)-(8)<br>
have been saved. Assume that the user changes the language<br>
setting from English to Japanese using this status-setting<br>
routine (English→Japanese in Fig.16B). Once processing of<br>
the status-setting routine has ended, the playback device<br>
executes processing to restore SPRMs(4)-(8) from memory to<br>
the register. Since SPRMs(4)-(8) are set in the register as<br>
a result of the restoration, the playback position is such<br>
that playback is resumed from the previous playback position.<br>
A further exemplary MOVIE object is shown in<br>
Figs.l7A-17C. If SPRM(13), which is the parental level<br>
setting in the playback device, is "kids" in the MOVIE object<br>
shown in Fig.l7A (if (SPRM (13) =="kids") ) , PL#4<br>
(Link (PL#4, PL#1) ) is played, and if the parental level in<br>
the playback device is any other setting apart from "kids"<br>
(i.e. "else"), PL#2 (Link(PL#2,PL#1)) is played. Here, it<br>
is possible to realize a so-called parental lock, since<br>
playback switches between extreme scenes and child-oriented<br>
scenes depending on the SPRM (13) setting when PL#2 and PL#4<br>
are assumed to be an extreme scene and a child-oriented scene,<br><br>
respectively. Since SPRM(13) can be changed using a<br>
status-setting routine, the resume_intension_flag in the<br>
attribute information is set to "0".<br>
Fig.l7B shows a playback control by the MOVIE object<br>
described above. This playback control is for setting<br>
SPRM(13) in the playback device to "kids". PL#4 is thus played<br>
since even SPRM(13) in the playback device is set to show<br>
"kids" (Link(PL#4, PL#1)).<br>
Assume that a menu call is requested when the playback<br>
device is on PL#4. Since the resume_intension_flag is set<br>
to "0" in Fig.l7A, SPRMs(4)-(8) are saved (Fig., 15B) after<br>
initializing SPRMs(5) - (8) (Fig.15A). Branching to the<br>
status-setting routine is then executed.<br>
Assume here that in this status-setting routine an<br>
operation is performed to update SPRM(13) and the<br>
status-setting routine has ended. Since SPRMs(4)-(8) are<br>
returned to the register in the playback device in the<br>
restoration performed after the end of the status-setting<br>
routine (Fig.15B), the playback position is set to the head<br>
of the Title and playback is restarted from this position<br>
(Fig.l7C).<br>
The examples shown above in Figs. 14, 16 and 17 are<br>
examples involving the resume_intension_flag setting.<br>
Figs.18A-18B show an example of Title_search_mask being set<br>
in MOVIE objects.<br><br>
MOVIE object (0) in Fig.18A is the MOVIE object executed<br>
prior to MOVIE object (1) shown in Fig.14A. In this MOVIE<br>
object, PL#6 is a preview(1) , PL#7 is a preview(2) , and PL#5<br>
is video for having the user select one of PL#6 and PL#7.<br>
Which of the preview is selected is set in GPRM(0) . Playback<br>
switching by an IF statement is performed according to<br>
GPRM(0). Jmp Movie Object (1) is a branch command executed<br>
after the switching, MOVIE object (1) being the branch target.<br>
Since Title_search_mask in MOVIE object (1) is set to "1",<br>
Title search requests are masked while playback controls are<br>
being performed by the MOVIE object. Conversely, a Title<br>
search will be activated if either of previews (1) and (2)<br>
is viewed (Fig.18B) . Since a control is realized to "prohibit<br>
title searches until either of previews (1) and (2) is viewed"<br>
by merely setting a 1-bit Title_search_mask, freedom in<br>
describing the control is increased. Let us draw a comparison<br>
with when the same playback controls as in Fig.18B are<br>
performed using Japanese patent application no. 285 6363.<br>
According to Japanese patent application no. 2856363, the<br>
permissibility of user operations is set with respect to<br>
individual playback path, which means that when there is a<br>
large number of previews that can be played alternately, the<br>
number of playback paths set to prohibit user operations must<br>
equal that number. As such, the number of playback paths that<br>
must be provided increases with the number of playable<br><br>
previews, thus inviting complications.<br>
In contrast, with the MOVIE object in Figs.18A-18B, a<br>
playback control for refusing Title searches until a preview<br>
is played can be described simply by setting the<br>
Title_search_mask in the MOVIE object to "1", even when there<br>
is a large number of alternately playable previews.<br>
Because of the easy description of this playback<br>
control, MOVIE objects pertaining to the present embodiment<br>
are effective when distributing Titles.<br>
Thus concludes the description relating to an<br>
embodiment of a recording medium pertaining to the present<br>
invention. The following description relates to an<br>
embodiment of a playback device pertaining to the present<br>
invention. Fig.19 shows the internal structure of a playback<br>
device pertaining to the present invention. A playback device<br>
pertaining to the present invention comprises two main parts,<br>
namely, a system LSI and a drive device, and can be produced<br>
industrially by mounting these parts to the cabinet and<br>
substrate of a device . The system LSI is an integrated circuit<br>
that integrates a variety of processing units for carrying<br>
out the functions of the playback device. A playback device<br>
thus produced is structured from a DVD drive 1, a track buffer<br>
2, a PID filter 4, a video decoder 5, a picture plane 6, an<br>
audio decoder 7, a graphics plane 8, a graphics decoder 9,<br>
an adder 10, a static scenario memory 11, an playback control<br><br>
engine 12, a player register 13, a BACKUP memory 14, a dynamic<br>
scenario memory 15, a DVD-like module 16, a Java module 17,<br>
a BROWSER module 18, a UO controller 19, a module manager<br>
20, and a dispatcher 21.<br>
BD-ROM drive 1 performs loading/ejecting of BD-ROMs,<br>
and accesses loaded BD-ROMs.<br>
Track buffer 2 is a FIFO memory that stores ACCESS UNITs<br>
read from BD-ROMs on a first-in first-out basis.<br>
PID filter 4 retrieves ACCESS UNITs from, track buffer<br>
2 and converts TS packets structuring ACCESS UNITs into PES<br>
packets. Desired PES packets obtained as a result of the<br>
conversion are outputted to one of video decoder 5, audio<br>
decoder 7, and graphics decoder 9. The outputting is<br>
performed while referring to the IDs (PIDs) of the PES packets.<br>
PES packets whose PID shows video are outputted to video<br>
decoder 5, PES packets whose PID shows audio are outputted<br>
to audio decoder 7, and PES packets whose PID shows graphics<br>
image are outputted to graphics decoder 9.<br>
Video decoder 5 writes uncompressed-format pictures<br>
obtained by decoding the plurality of PES packets outputted<br>
from PID filter 4 to picture plane 6.<br>
Picture plane 6 is a memory for storing<br>
uncompressed-format pictures.<br>
Audio decoder 7 outputs uncompressed-format audio data<br>
obtained by decoding PES packets outputted from PID filter<br><br>
4.<br>
Graphics plane 8 is a memory having a single screen<br>
capacity area that can stores one screen worth of graphics<br>
images.<br>
Graphics decoder 9 writes raster images obtained by<br>
decoding graphics streams to graphics plane 8. Subtitles,<br>
menus and the like appear on a screen as a result of decoding<br>
graphics streams.<br>
Adder 10 outputs the result of synthesizing images<br>
expanded in graphics plane 8 with uncompressed-format<br>
picture data stored in picture plane 6.<br>
Static scenario memory 11 is a memory for storing<br>
current PL information, Clip information, and the like.<br>
Current PL information is the piece currently targeted for<br>
processing from among the plurality of PL information<br>
recorded on the BD-ROM. Current Clip information is the piece<br>
currently targeted for processing from among the plurality<br>
of Clip information recorded on the BD-ROM.<br>
Playback control engine 12 executes various functions,<br>
such as AV playback functions (1), PlayList playback<br>
functions (2), and status-acquisition/setting functions (3)<br>
in the playback device. AV playback functions in the playback<br>
device, which consist of a function group similar to that<br>
found in DVD and CD players, refer to the execution in response<br>
to user operations of processing such as Play, Stop, Pause-On,<br><br>
Pause-Off, Still-Off, Forward Play (fast), Reverse Play<br>
(fast), Audio Change, Subtitle Change, and Angle Change. PL<br>
playback functions refer to the execution of Play, Stop and<br>
other of the AV playback functions in accordance with PL<br>
information. Playback control engine 12 carries out the<br>
functions of the third layer (playback controls based on<br>
static scenarios) in the layer model by executing these PL<br>
playback functions. On the other hand, playback control<br>
engine 12 executes functions (2) to (3) in accordance with<br>
function calls from DVD-like module 16, Java module 17, and<br>
BROWSER module 18. That is, playback control engine 12<br>
executes the functions of playback control engine 12 in<br>
response to instructions resulting from user operations and<br>
instructions from superordinate layers in the layer model.<br>
Player register 13 comprises 32 individual System<br>
Parameter Registers and 32 individual General Purpose<br>
Registers. The stored values of these registers are used in<br>
programming as SPRMs and GPRMs. Since System Parameter<br>
Registers and General Purpose Registers are managed by<br>
playback control engine 12, which is separate from modules<br>
16 to 18, it is possible, even when a change in playback modes<br>
occurs, for instance, for the module that executes the<br>
playback mode after the switch to find out the playback status<br>
of the playback device simply by referring to SPRMs(0) - (31)<br>
and GPRMs(0) - (31) in playback control engine 12.<br><br>
BACKUP memory 14 is a stack memory for saving stored<br>
values of the playback device register when one of modules<br>
16 to 18 executes Suspend. The stored values of BACKUP memory<br>
14 are restored to the stored values of the register possessed<br>
by the playback device when one of modules 16 to 18 executes<br>
Resume in a dynamic scenario. The stored values of registers<br>
are stored in a first-in first-out basis in the event that<br>
one of modules 16 to 18 performs Suspend two or more times.<br>
If the number of stored values is greater than or equal to<br>
the number of slots in the stacks, stored values that have<br>
been saved are overwritten. SPRMs saved to BACKUP memory 14<br>
includes the number of the Title currently being played<br>
(Title Number), the currently-being-played Chapter number,<br>
the currently-being-played PL number (PlayList Number) , the<br>
currently-being-played PlayItem number (PlayItem Number),<br>
the number of the button in a selected-state (Selected<br>
Button), and time information showing the current playback<br>
time.<br>
Dynamic scenario memory 15 is a memory storing the<br>
current dynamic scenario, and is jointly processed by<br>
DVD-like module 16, Java module 17 and BROWSER module 18.<br>
The current dynamic scenario is the dynamic scenario<br>
currently targeted for processing from among the plurality<br>
of scenarios recorded on the BD-ROM.<br>
DVD-like module 16, which is a DVD virtual player that<br><br>
is the main execution body of MOVIE mode, executes current<br>
MOVIE objects read to dynamic scenario memory 15.<br>
Java module 17 is a Java platform formed from a Java<br>
virtual machine, a configuration and a profile.<br>
Java module 17 creates current Java objects from<br>
ZZZ.CLASS files read to dynamic scenario memory 15, and<br>
executes the current Java objects. The Java virtual machine<br>
converts Java objects described using a Java language into<br>
native codes for the CPU in the playback device, and has the<br>
CPU execute the native codes.<br>
BROWSER module 18, which is a browser that is the main<br>
execution body of Browser mode, executes current WebPage<br>
objects read to dynamic scenario memory 15.<br>
UO controller 19 detects user operations performed with<br>
respect to a remote controller, a front panel of the playback<br>
device or the like, and outputs information showing detected<br>
user operations (hereinafter "UO information") to module<br>
manager 20.<br>
Module manager 20 holds an Index Table read from the<br>
BD-ROM and performs mode management and branch controls . Mode<br>
management performed by module manager 20 refers to the<br>
allocation of modules; namely, which of modules 16 to 20 is<br>
to execute what dynamic scenarios. The principle of module<br>
allocation is that DVD-like module 16 executes dynamic<br>
scenarios. This principle is upheld even if in the case of<br><br>
branches resulting from intra-modes (i.e. branches within<br>
the same mode). An exception is when inter-mode branching<br>
occurs (i.e. branching between modes). When branching from<br>
a MOVIE object to a Java object/Webpage object occurs, Java<br>
module 17 and BROWSER module 18 respectively execute the<br>
current object.<br>
Dispatcher 21 chooses only UOs apposite to the current<br>
mode of the playback device, and passes chosen UOs on to the<br>
module for executing the current mode. For example, if arrow<br>
key or activate UOs are received during the execution of MOVIE<br>
mode, dispatcher 21 outputs these UOs to the module executing<br>
MOVIE mode. These UOs are only required for menu behavior<br>
in MOVIE mode, and are not required by Java and Browser modes .<br>
Thus concludes the description of the playback device<br>
elements. Module manager 20 will now be described in detail.<br>
Module manager 20 can be implemented by having a general<br>
purpose CPU read programs for performing the processing<br>
procedures shown in Figs. 20 to 22. Figs. 20 to 22 are<br>
flowcharts showing the processing procedures performed by<br>
module manager 20. Branch controls performed by module<br>
manager 20 will now be described while referring to these<br>
flowcharts. In the Fig.20 flowchart, module manager 20<br>
retrieves a filename from the First Play Index in the Index<br>
Table (step S1) . The Index Table is integrated information<br>
relating to MOVIE objects, and the First Play Index is an<br><br>
Index showing MOVIE objects that describe BD-ROM startup<br>
procedures.<br>
Once the filename has been retrieved, module manager<br>
20 sets the current mode to MOVIE mode (step S2) , sets the<br>
dynamic scenario of the retrieved filename as the current<br>
dynamic scenario (step S3) , reads the current dynamic<br>
scenario i to memory (step S4) , and executes current dynamic<br>
scenario in memory (steps S5-S9).<br>
Steps S4 to S9 are executed whenever the current dynamic<br>
scenario is newly set.<br>
Steps S5 to S9 form a loop processing procedure in which<br>
the processing of steps S6 to S9 is repeated for each command<br>
structuring a scenario. The "x" in the flowcharts is a<br>
variable that identifies processing targets from among the<br>
commands structuring a dynamic scenario. The loop processing<br>
involves module manager 20 repeating the following<br>
processing: initializing variable x (step S5), having the<br>
module of the current mode execute command x included in the<br>
current dynamic scenario i (step S6), performing the judgment<br>
processing defined in steps S7 to S8, and then incrementing<br>
variable x (step S9), before returning the step S6. The<br>
processing of steps S6 to S9 is repeated for all of the<br>
commands structuring the scenario.<br>
If a UO occurs during execution of the loop processing<br>
(step S7=YES) , module manager 20 outputs the UO to the module<br><br>
executing the current mode (step S26) after passing though<br>
the judgment processing of steps S10 to S12.<br>
Step S10 is a step for judging whether the user<br>
operation is a menu call. If a menu call, module manager 20<br>
performs the save processing of one of steps S15 and S16 in<br>
Fig.21 after passing through the judgments of steps S13 and<br>
S14. Module manager 20 then sets a dynamic scenario for<br>
performing status setting as the current dynamic scenario<br>
i (step S17), and returns to step S4. Since a dynamic scenario<br>
for performing status setting becomes the current dynamic<br>
scenario i as a result of step S17, the dynamic scenario for<br>
status setting is executed at steps S5 to S9.<br>
Step S13 is a judgment as to whether the menu_call_mask<br>
in the current dynamic scenario i is "1". If "1", module<br>
manager 20 returns to step S8 in Fig.20 without performing<br>
any processing.<br>
Step S15 is processing to suspend the current dynamic<br>
scenario i and save variable x and SPRMs(4) to (8) in BACKUP<br>
memory 14. Step S15 is executed if the resume_intension_f lag<br>
is "1" (step S14=YES).<br>
Step S16 is processing to suspend the current dynamic<br>
scenario i and save variable x and SPRMs(4) to (8) in BACKUP<br>
memory 14 after initializing variable x and SPRMs (5) to (8) .<br>
Step S16 is executed if the resume_intension_flag is "0"<br>
(step S14=NO).<br><br>
Step S11 is a judgment as to whether the user operation<br>
requests a Title search. If a Title search is requested,<br>
module manager 20 judges in step S18 whether the<br>
Title_search_mask of the current dynamic scenario i is "1".<br>
If "1", module manager 20 sets a dynamic scenario for<br>
performing title searches as the current dynamic scenario<br>
i in step S19.<br>
Step S12 is for executing dispatch processing of the<br>
UO. Dispatch processing of a UO involves module manager 20<br>
judging whether a UO that occurs during command execution<br>
is an arrow key or activate operation (step S12) , and if the<br>
current mode is MOVIE mode (step S20), outputting the UO to<br>
the module that executes the current mode. If the UO that<br>
occurred during command execution is other than an arrow key<br>
or activate operation, the UO is simply outputted to the<br>
module that executes the current mode (step S26) . If the UO<br>
that occurred during command execution is an arrow key or<br>
activate operation but the current mode is not MOVIE mode,<br>
the UO is not outputted to a module. Thus concludes the<br>
description of dispatch processing.<br>
The requirement for ending the loop processing of steps<br>
S4 to S19 is that judgment in step S8 be YES. If the command<br>
x is the final command in dynamic scenario i (step S8=YES),<br>
a judgment is conducted as to whether a Resume command is<br>
last in dynamic scenario i (step S21 in Fig.22) .<br><br>
A Resume command is a command instructing the playback<br>
device to perform status-restoration of the dynamic scenario<br>
that is the call source. Resume commands are placed at the<br>
end of dynamic scenarios for status setting (i.e.<br>
status-setting routines) .<br>
If a Resume command exists at the end of dynamic<br>
scenario i, module manager 20 sets the suspended dynamic<br>
scenario as dynamic scenario i (step S22), sets the mode of<br>
dynamic scenario i as the current mode (step S23) , restores<br>
the SPRMs saved in BACKUP memory 14 to the register (step<br>
S24) , and returns variable x to the saved value (step S25) .<br>
Here, since SPRMs(4)-(8) and variable x are saved to<br>
memory 14 after being set to values showing the playback<br>
position up until that point in time if the<br>
resume_intension_flag is "1", the player register shows the<br>
playback position prior to the call for a status-setting<br>
routine as a result of the restore processing performed at<br>
step S24. Processing to resume Title playback is performed<br>
because of these values being set in the player register.<br>
On the other hand, since SPRMs(4)-(8) and variable x<br>
are saved to memory 14 after SPRMs (5)-(8) and variable x have<br>
been initialized if the resume_intension_flag is "0", the<br>
player register shows the playback start position of the<br>
Title currently being played. Processing to restart, the Title<br>
is performed because of these values being set in the player<br><br>
register. It should be noted that although in the flowcharts<br>
of Figs.20 to 22 the restart is executed from the Title<br>
currently being played, the restart may be performed with<br>
respect to the entire BD-ROM by initializing all SPRMs<br>
showing playback positions at step S16. Thus concludes the<br>
description of processing procedures performed by module<br>
manager 20.<br>
According to the present embodiment as described above,<br>
control procedures pertaining to menu calls at an upper-most<br>
layer (dynamic scenarios) are set in a layer mode comprising,<br>
from bottom to top, streams, playback paths, and dynamic<br>
scenarios. In particular, when Titles that the user wants<br>
to create are for realizing language credits, it is possible<br>
to realize controls in which menu calls are accepted but<br>
playback is not resumed. As a result, it is possible to easily<br>
create two types of Titles, namely, those that permit menu<br>
calls and those that prohibit menu calls, even with the same<br>
streams and playback paths. Since there is no increase in<br>
the number of playback paths and streams with the creation<br>
of Titles, it is possible with little effort to increase the<br>
number of variations having different control procedures.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Embodiment 2 relates an enhancement that allows Stop<br>
and Restart in a playback device to be avoided. Stop and<br><br>
Restart in a playback device can occur when any of the<br>
following three situations arise in the playback device.<br>
1)	When branching to a Java object or a WebPage object<br>
occurs with a BD-ROM corresponding to Java mode and Browser<br>
mode loaded in a playback device corresponding only to MOVIE<br>
mode.<br>
2)	When attempting to read a non-existent stream, or<br>
attempting to branch to a Title structured from a<br>
non-existent dynamic scenario.<br>
3)	When recovering an error that occurs with a Java<br>
object is not possible.<br>
With the present embodiment for avoiding Stop and<br>
Restart, an INDEX relating to Titles for use in exception<br>
processing is provided in information for<br>
integrating/managing dynamic scenarios.<br>
INFO.BD shown in Fig.4 is information for<br>
integrating/managing dynamic scenarios in MOVIE mode, Java<br>
mode, and Browser mode.<br>
Fig.23A shows an internal structure of INFO.BD. As<br>
shown in Fig.23A, INFO.BD includes an Index Table. The Index<br>
Table is an indirect reference table that is referenced when<br>
branching from one dynamic scenario to another dynamic<br>
scenario, and comprises Indexes corresponding one-to-one<br>
with a plurality of labels. In each Index is described a<br>
filename of a dynamic scenario corresponding the label of<br><br>
the Index. As shown in Fig.23B, Each filename comprises a<br>
file body and an extension. The labels include Title#1~#m,<br>
Title#m+1~#n, and Title#0. The Index Table is also referred<br>
to from dynamic scenarios of any of the three modes . Branching<br>
from MOVIE objects to Java objects or from MOVIE objects to<br>
WebPage objects is only possible when via the Index Table.<br>
To rephrase, it is not possible to branch from a MOVIE object<br>
to a Java or WebPage object that does not have an Index in<br>
the Index Table.<br>
The TITLE#1~#m Indexes relate to the 1st to mth Titles<br>
entered in the BD-ROM. In these Indexes are described the<br>
filenames of MOVIE objects that are to be branch targets when<br>
the 1st to mth Title numbers are selected. Fig.23B shows the<br>
content of TITLE#l~#m. As shown in Fig.23B, the filenames<br>
of MOVIE objects are described in the Title#1~#m Indexes.<br>
Each filename comprises a file body (ZZZ) and an extension<br>
(.MOVIE).<br>
The TITLE#m+1~#n Indexes relate to the 1st to m+lth<br>
Titles entered in the BD-ROM. In these Indexes are described<br>
the filenames of WebPage objects/Java objects that are to<br>
be the branch target when the m+lth to nth Title numbers are<br>
selected. Fig.23C shows an internal structure of the<br>
TITLE#m+l~#n Indexes. As shown in Fig.23C, in each of Indexes<br>
TITLE#m+l~#n is stored either the file body (ZZZ) and<br>
extension (.CLASS) of a Java object or the file body (ZZZ)<br><br>
and extension (.HTM) of a WebPage object. It should be noted<br>
that Index format may be as shown in Fig.23D. The Index in<br>
the Fig.23D format has an attribute area showing an attribute<br>
of the branch-target Title, the Index being structured to<br>
show in the attribute area whether the dynamic scenario of<br>
the corresponding branch-target Title is MOVIE mode ("00"<br>
setting), Java mode ("01" setting), or Browser mode ("10"<br>
setting).<br>
TITLE#0INDEX relates to an exception processing Title,<br>
and stores the filename of a MOVIE mode scenario. The<br>
exception processing described here is executed when any of<br>
the above three situations arises. A playback device in which<br>
enhanced mode execution is not possible for any of these three<br>
reasons is called a core system. On the other hand, a playback<br>
device in which program execution using a Java virtual<br>
machine or a Browser is possible is called a full system.<br>
Indirect referencing of a BD-ROM by a core system and a full<br>
system is described below while referring to Figs.24A-24B.<br>
The description of indirect referencing assumes a BD-ROM on<br>
which a plurality of dynamic scenarios is recorded (001.MOVIE,<br>
002. MOVIE, 003. MOVIE, ..., 001. CLASS, 002. CLASS, 003. CLASS,<br>
...) , as shown in Fig.24A. Fig.24B shows an exemplary<br>
description of an Index Table when the plurality of dynamic<br>
scenarios shown in Fig.24A is recorded on the BD-ROM. In the<br>
exemplary description shown in Fig.24B, the filenames of<br><br>
MOVIE mode scenarios (001.MOVIE, 002.MOVIE, 003.MOVIE, ...)<br>
are described in Title#1Index to Title#mIndex. On the other<br>
hand, the filenames of enhanced mode scenarios (001.CLASS,<br>
002.CLASS, 003.CLASS, ...) are described in Title#m+1Index to<br>
Title#nIndex.<br>
Fig.25A shows indirect referencing in a full system<br>
when the Index Table is described as in Fig.24B. Because of<br>
the Index Table being described as such, filenames "001 .MOVIE,<br>
002.MOVIE, 003.MOVIE, ..." are retrieved from Title#1Index to<br>
Title#1Index when executing branch commands specifying<br>
labels Title#l to Title#m as branch targets, and filenames<br>
"001.CLASS, 002.CLASS, 003.CLASS, ..." are retrieved from<br>
Title#m+1Index to Titletnlndex when executing branch<br>
commands specifying labels Title#m+1 to Title#n as branch<br>
targets. Dynamic scenarios specified by these filenames are<br>
then read to memory and executed. Thus concludes the<br>
description of indirect referencing by a full system.<br>
Fig.25B shows indirect referencing in a core system.<br>
Filenames "001.MOVIE, 002.MOVIE, 003.MOVIE, ..." are retrieved<br>
from Title#1Index to Title#mIndex when executing branch<br>
commands specifying labels Title#l to Title#m as branch<br>
targets. However, when executing branch commands specifying<br>
labels Title#m+1 to Title#n as branch targets, filename<br>
"000.MOVIE" is retrieved from Title#0Index in place of<br>
Title#m+llndex to Title#nIndex. The playback device then<br><br>
executes the dynamic scenarios specified by these filenames.<br>
Thus concludes the description of indirect referencing by<br>
both a full system and a core system.<br>
Fig.26 schematically shows how branching from a MOVIE<br>
object to a Java object is performed. The MOVIE object in<br>
Fig.26 comprises a pre-command in which GPRM(0) is set to<br>
"0", a command (PlayPL(PL#l) ) instructing the playback<br>
device to perform PL playback, and a post-command instructing<br>
the playback device to perform branching to another dynamic<br>
scenario (IF(GPRM(0)=0){Jmp Title#m}else{Jmp Title#m+1}).<br>
As a result of this pre-command, GPRM(0) is initialized prior<br>
to PL playback. Also, as a result of this post-command,<br>
branching is performed to MOVIE object#m+1 if GPRM(0) shows<br>
"0" when initialized. On the other hand, branching is<br>
performed to another Title (Title#m) if a button selection<br>
is performed when a menu is displayed and GPRM(0) is set to<br>
a value other than "0".<br>
Interactive graphics streams for realizing dialogue<br>
processing as described below are multiplexed onto AVClips.<br>
Interactive graphics streams are streams displaying buttons<br>
corresponding to characters A, B and C, GPRM{0) being set<br>
to "1" when character A is determined, "2" when character<br>
B is determined, and "3" when character C is determined.<br>
The arrows jn1 and jn2 in Fig.26 symbolically indicate<br>
the branching from a MOVIE object to a Java object. Jmp<br><br>
Title#m+1 in Fig.26 is a branch command in a Java object,<br>
and specifies the Java object as a branch target using an<br>
indirect referencing format via the Index of label Title#m+1.<br>
The filename of the Java object is described in the Index<br>
of label Title#m+1, the playback device being able to find<br>
out which file to read as the Java object by referring to<br>
this Index.<br>
In the Java object, "A.drawCharacter () ;" means that the<br>
Object of character A is drawn on the screen using one of<br>
the methods (i.e. the drawCharacter function in Fig.26) of<br>
the Class "character A". Likewise, "B.drawCharacter();" and<br>
"C.drawCharacter();" mean respectively that the Objects of<br>
characters B and C are drawn on the screen using one of the<br>
methods (i.e. the drawCharacter function in Fig.26) of the<br>
Classes "character B" and "character C".<br>
Since "A.drawCharacter();", "B.drawCharacter();" and<br>
"C.drawCharacter();" are executed exclusively depending on<br>
the value of GPRM(0) (IF statements in Fig.26), the CG of<br>
character A is drawn if GPRM(0) is "1", the CG of character<br>
B is drawn if GPRM(0) is "2", and the CG of character C is<br>
drawn if GPRM(0) is "3".<br>
Fig.27 shows what kind of branching is performed when<br>
a BD-ROM having the scenarios shown in Fig.26 recorded<br>
thereon is loaded in a core system playback device. Depicting<br>
the arrows in Fig.26 using the broken line hs1 in Fig.27 shows<br><br>
that the branching in Fig.26 is no longer valid because of<br>
the core system lacking an element for executing Java objects.<br>
The arrow js1 in Fig.27 shows branching used in exception<br>
processing performed in place of the invalid branching. The<br>
branching used in exception processing is indirect<br>
referencing via the Index of Title#0. The filename of MOVIE<br>
object sg1 is stored in the Index of Title#0, MOVIE object<br>
sg1 being read by the playback device and executed in this<br>
branching. Because of displaying video in MOVIE objects when<br>
the BD-ROM is loaded in a playback device having only a core<br>
system, it is possible to avoid Stop and Restart.<br>
Thus concludes the description relating to enhancement<br>
of the BD-ROM in embodiment 2. Enhancements on the playback<br>
device side will now be described.<br>
A characteristic of module manager 20 in embodiment 2<br>
is the branch control. Branch controls read dynamic scenarios<br>
identified as branch targets to memory, and have one of<br>
DVD-like module 16, Java module 17 and BROWSER module 18<br>
execute the dynamic scenarios. Identification is necessary<br>
particularly when branch-target dynamic scenarios are<br>
specified using an indirect referencing format.<br>
Identification is carried out by referring to the<br>
branch-target labels of branch commands and retrieving<br>
filenames from Indexes corresponding to the labels. A<br>
judgment as to whether mode switching is necessary is<br><br>
performed in conjunction with this identification. The<br>
mode-switching judgment is performed by referring to the<br>
Index corresponding to the branch-target label so as to<br>
determine the file extension stored or the mode shown by<br>
stored attribute information. The stored content of the Index<br>
reveals whether mode switching is necessary. If mode<br>
switching is necessary, the branch-target dynamic scenario<br>
is read to memory, and a mode-transition request is outputted<br>
to the module that executes the post-switching mode. As a<br>
result of the mode-transition request being outputted, the<br>
module executing the post-switching mode executes the<br>
branch-target dynamic scenario in memory.<br>
The processing procedures by module manager 2 0 in<br>
embodiment 2 as a result of module manager 20 performing the<br>
above branch controls are as shown in Fig.28. Fig.28, being<br>
based on the flowchart shown in Fig.20, depicts the<br>
differences between the two flowcharts.<br>
Although commands in the current dynamic scenario i are<br>
executed one at a time by repeating the steps S6 to S9, step<br>
S30 has been newly added to the loop processing of steps S6<br>
to S9 in the Fig.28 flowchart.<br>
Step S30 is a judgment as to whether or not command x<br>
is a branch command. If Step S30 is YES, module manager 20<br>
returns to step S4 after setting the current dynamic scenario<br>
to the new dynamic scenario in steps S31 to s43. As a result,<br><br>
the new dynamic scenario is read to memory and executed.<br>
The following description relates to the processing in<br>
steps S31 to S43. This processing involves branch controls,<br>
and differs depending on the judgment results of steps S31,<br>
S34, S39 and S42. Step S31 is a judgment as to whether the<br>
branch target of a branch command is described using a Title<br>
label. If YES, module manager 20 acquires the branch-target<br>
label Titlej after passing through the step S42 judgment<br>
(step S32), and retrieves filenamej from Indexi of Titlej<br>
in the Index Table (step S33) . If NO, module manager 20<br>
retrieves filenamej showing the branch target (step S41).<br>
Step S34 is a judgment as to whether the branch command<br>
is a Call command or a Jmp command. If a Call command, module<br>
manager 20 saves variable x and SPRMs after suspending the<br>
current dynamic scenario i (step S35). If a Jmp command,<br>
module manager 20 discards the current dynamic scenario i<br>
(step S36) .<br>
Having passed through the above processing, module<br>
manager 20 sets the dynamic scenario identified from<br>
filenamej as the current dynamic scenario i (step S37), and<br>
sets the playback mode identified from the retrieved<br>
extension as playback mode k (step S38), After these settings,<br>
module manager 20 executes step S39. Step S39 is a judgment<br>
as to whether playback mode k is the current playback mode.<br>
If not the same, module manager 20 sets playback mode k as<br><br>
the current playback mode (step S40) , and transfers to step<br>
S4. After that the processing of steps S4 to S9 is repeated<br>
with respect to the newly set current dynamic scenario. Step<br>
S42 is a judgment as to whether the playback device is a core<br>
system or a full system, and if a core system, module manager<br>
20 retrieves the filename from Index of Title#0, and sets<br>
this as the branch target (step S43).<br>
Since the playback device is set as a core system when<br>
difficulties are encountered with enhanced mode execution<br>
for some reason, and branching performed while referring to<br>
an Index in the Index Table for use in exception processing,<br>
it is possible according to the present embodiment as<br>
described above to avoid Stop, Restart, and the like.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Embodiment 3 relates to enhancements when playback<br>
devices and BD-ROMs of various specifications are introduced.<br>
When there is strong pressure to quickly commercialize<br>
BD-ROMs and playback devices, BD-ROM versions with few<br>
supportable functions, such as version 1. 0 that only supports<br>
MOVIE mode and version 1.1 that supports MOVIE mode and<br>
enhanced modes, end up being commercialized and thrown on<br>
the market. In this case, the market end up getting populated<br>
with a number of versions of playback devices, such as version<br>
1.0 and version 1.1 BD-ROMs, and version 1.0 and version 1.1<br><br>
playback devices. This being the case, branching from a MOVIE<br>
object in MOVIE mode to a MOVIE object in an enhanced mode<br>
may occur with a version 1.1 BD-ROM loaded in a version 1.0<br>
playback device, for example. In this case, it is not possible<br>
to execute the MOVIE object in an enhanced mode since the<br>
version 1.0 playback device only has a module for MOVIE mode.<br>
Thus with the present embodiment, Index Tables relating to<br>
all available versions are recorded on BD-ROMs. Fig.29A is<br>
a version 1.1 BD-ROM. A version 1.1 Index Table and a version<br>
1.0 Index Table are recorded on the BD-ROM in Fig.29A.<br>
TITLE#1INDEX to TITLE#mINDEX exist in the version 1.0 Index<br>
Table. As shown in embodiment 2, these INDEXs are referred<br>
to when branching to MOVIE-mode dynamic scenarios.<br>
TITLE#1INDEX to TITLE#mINDEX, TITLE#m+lINDEX to<br>
TITLE#nINDEX, and TITLE#0INDEX exist in the version 1.1 Index<br>
Table. As shown in embodiment 2, these INDEXs are referred<br>
to when branching to MOVIE-mode dynamic scenarios, enhanced<br>
mode dynamic scenarios, and dynamic scenarios used in<br>
exception processing.<br>
When one of these versions of a BD-ROM is loaded in a<br>
playback device, the playback device selects MOVIE objects<br>
using the Index Table matching the version of the playback<br>
device from among the Index Tables relating to the plurality<br>
of versions recorded on the BD-ROM.<br>
Fig.29B assumes a state in which the BD-ROM shown in<br><br>
Fig.29A is loaded in a version 1.0 playback device. Since<br>
the playback device in Fig.29B is version 1.0, when branching<br>
occurs, branch-target MOVIE objects are identified by<br>
referring to the version 1.0 Index Table out of the version<br>
1.0 and 1.1 Index Tables.<br>
Fig.29C assumes a state in which the BD-ROM shown in<br>
Fig.29A is loaded in a version 1.1 playback device. Since<br>
the playback device in Fig.29C is version 1.1, when branching<br>
occurs, branch-target MOVIE objects are identified by<br>
referring to the version 1.1 Index Table out of the version<br>
1.0 and 1.1 Index Tables.<br>
In order to perform the above processing, module<br>
manager 20 in a playback device according to embodiment 3<br>
performs processing based on the flowchart in Fig.30. When<br>
a BD-ROM is loaded in the playback device, module manager<br>
20 acquires the version number in the device (step S45) , reads<br>
whichever of the plurality of Index Tables recorded on the<br>
BD-ROM matches the acquired version number, and holds the<br>
read Index Table (step S46) . Module manager 20 then performs<br>
the processing of steps S1 to S42 while referring to the held<br>
Index Table. Description of the processing of steps S1 to<br>
S42, being the same as that shown in embodiment 2, is omitted<br>
ere.<br>
According the present embodiment as described above,<br>
s possible to guarantee compatibility with past versions<br><br>
of playback devices even when various versions of playback<br>
devices and BD-ROMs appear on the market, by choosing an Index<br>
Table that matches the version of the playback device and<br>
performing playback with reference to this Index Table.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
The present embodiment relates to enhancements when<br>
realizing similar menu controls to DVD on a BD-ROM. Fig.31<br>
shows a menu hierarchy realized by a BD-ROM.. The menu<br>
hierarchy in Fig.31 is structured to place a TopMenu at the<br>
highest level, and to be able to select a subordinate<br>
TitleMenu, SubtitleMenu, and AudioMenu from the TopMenu. The<br>
arrows sw1, sw2 and sw3 in Fig.31 schematically show menu<br>
switching by button selection. The TopMenu disposes buttons<br>
for receiving which of an audio selection, a subtitle<br>
selection, and a Title selection to perform (buttons sn1,<br>
sn2,.sn3 in Fig.31).<br>
The TitleMenu disposes buttons for receiving movie work<br>
selections, such as selection of a cinema version of a movie<br>
work (Title), a director's cut version, or a game version.<br>
The AudioMenu disposes buttons for receiving whether audio<br>
playback is to be in Japanese or English, and the SubtitleMenu<br>
disposes buttons for receiving whether subtitle display is<br>
to be in Japanese or English.<br>
MOVIE objects for operating menus having such a<br><br>
hierarchy are shown in Fig.32.<br>
A FirstPlay object (FirstPlay OBJ) is a dynamic<br>
scenario describing a startup procedure when loading a BD-ROM<br>
in a playback device. The square boxes representing the<br>
FirstPlay object show commands for executing this setup<br>
procedure. The last command of the FirstPlay object is a<br>
branch command, the branch target being a TopMenu object.<br>
The TopMenu object {TOPMenu OBJ) is a dynamic scenario<br>
for controlling the behavior of the TopMenu. The TopMenu<br>
object is the object called when a user requests a menu call,<br>
and equates to the status-setting routine mentioned in<br>
embodiment 1. The square boxes representing the TopMenu<br>
object schematize individual commands that express this<br>
control procedure. Included in these commands are a command<br>
for changing a state of buttons in the TopMenu in response<br>
to operations from the user, and a branch command for<br>
branching in response to the activation of buttons. The<br>
branch command realizes menu switching from the TopMenu to<br>
the TitleMenu, from the TopMenu to the SubtitleMenu, and from<br>
the TopMenu to the AudioMenu.<br>
An AudioMenu object (AudioMenu OBJ) is a dynamic<br>
scenario for controlling the behavior of the AudioMenu. The<br>
square boxes structuring the AudioMenu object schematize<br>
individual commands that express this control procedure.<br>
Included in these commands is a command for changing a state<br><br>
of buttons in the AudioMenu in response to operations from<br>
the user, and a command for updating SPRMs used in audio<br>
setting in response to the activation of buttons.<br>
A SubtitleMenu object (SubtitleMenu OBJ) is a dynamic<br>
scenario for controlling the behavior of the SubtitleMenu.<br>
The square boxes structuring the SubtitleMenu object<br>
schematize individual commands that express this control<br>
procedure. Included in these commands is a command for<br>
changing a state of buttons in the SubtitleMenu in response<br>
to operations from the user, and a command for updating SPRMs<br>
used in audio setting in response to the activation of<br>
buttons.<br>
A TitleMenu object (TitleMenu OBJ) is a dynamic<br>
scenario for controlling the behavior of the TitleMenu. The<br>
TitleMenu object is the object called when a user requests<br>
a Title search, and equates to the dynamic scenario used for<br>
Title searching mentioned in embodiment 1. The square boxes<br>
structuring the TitleMenu object schematize individual<br>
commands that express this control procedure. Included in<br>
these commands are a command for changing a state of buttons<br>
in the TitleMenu in response to operations from the user,<br>
and a branch command for branching in response to the<br>
activation of buttons. The branch command realizes branching<br>
to individual Titles.<br>
Menu behavior such as that realized in DVD can be<br><br>
realized by these MOVIE objects for use with menus. Thus<br>
concludes the description of MOVIE objects relating to menu<br>
controls.<br>
Enhancement of the Index Table in the present<br>
embodiment will now be described. A FirstPlay Index, a<br>
TOPMenu Index, an AudioMenu Index, a SubtitleMenu Index, and<br>
a TitleMenu Index are added to the Index Table in the present<br>
embodiment. As described in embodiment 1, these indexes are<br>
also referred to by dynamic scenarios relating to each of<br>
the three modes.<br>
The FirstPlay Index is referred to during BD-ROM<br>
startup. The filename of the FirstPlay object is described<br>
in this index.<br>
The TopMenu Index, AudioMenu Index, SubtitleMenu Index,<br>
and TitleMenu Index are referred to when user operations are<br>
conducted to directly call the AudioMenu, SubtitleMenu, and<br>
TitleMenu. A direct call by a user is conducted by the user<br>
depressing an Audio select key, a Subtitle select key, or<br>
a Title select key on a remote controller.<br>
Thus concludes the description of enhancements to MOVIE<br>
objects in the present embodiment. Enhancement of a playback<br>
device in the present embodiment will now be described. To<br>
operate MOVIE objects such as these, module manager 2 0 needs<br>
to perform the processing procedures shown in the Fig.33<br>
flowchart.<br><br>
In the present embodiment, module manager 20, which<br>
originally performs menu controls, performs branch controls<br>
using the processing procedures shown in Fig.33. This<br>
flowchart differs in that step S50 has been inserted between<br>
steps S30 and S31. If YES in step S50, module manager 20<br>
performs the steps S51 to S54 processing and returns to step<br>
S4. Steps S51 to S54 involve the setting of a scenario for<br>
conducting menu controls as the current dynamic scenario.<br>
That is, if the branch target of the branch command is xxxMenu<br>
(step S50=YES), module manager 20 suspends the current<br>
dynamic scenario i, saves SPRMs and variable ;
retrieves a filename from the Index corresponding to the<br>
branch-target menu (step S52) , sets the dynamic scenario of<br>
the retrieved filename as the current dynamic scenario i<br>
(step S53), and returns the current mode to MOVIE mode (step<br>
S54). After that module manager 20 proceeds to execute the<br>
current dynamic scenario.<br>
Since branching to dynamic scenarios for menu controls<br>
is realized in indirect referencing via the Indexes of the<br>
Index Table, it is possible according to the present<br>
embodiment as described above to branch to dynamic scenarios<br>
for use in menu controls, even when a menu key is depressed<br>
during execution of Java mode or Browser mode. Audio and<br>
Subtitle switching from a Java virtual machine and Browser<br>
mode is made possible, thus realizing Audio and Subtitle<br><br>
switching similar to normal DVD even when playback is<br>
performed using a Java virtual machine or Browser mode.<br>
Embodiment 5<br>
Embodiment 5 relates to an enhancement for preventing<br>
any detrimental effects that may be exerted on other modes<br>
by data provided for MOVIE mode. Controls in MOVIE mode can<br>
be performed not only by MOVIE objects but also by commands<br>
(button commands) in interactive graphics streams<br>
multiplexed onto AVClips.<br>
Button commands are executed when buttons described by<br>
graphics streams are activated. Having button commands<br>
incorporated in AVClips is convenient in the description of<br>
playback controls for having a playback device execute<br>
specific processing according to timings at which individual<br>
frames of particular moving images appear on a screen; that<br>
is, playback controls synchronized closely with the moving<br>
image content. Also, since button commands are multiplexed<br>
on the actual AVClip, it is not necessary to store all of<br>
the button commands corresponding to the AVClip in memory,<br>
even when there are several hundred sections wanting to<br>
perform playback controls. Since button commands are read<br>
from a BD-ROM for every ACCESS UNIT together with video<br>
packets, it is preferable to have button commands<br>
corresponding to a moving-image section for current playback<br><br>
reside in memory, and then to delete these button commands<br>
from memory when playback of this moving-image section and<br>
store button commands corresponding to the next moving-image<br>
section in memory. Since button commands are multiplexed onto<br>
AVClips, it is possible to reduce the installed memory to<br>
a minimum required amount, even when, for instance, there<br>
are several hundred button commands.<br>
When button commands are embedded in a stream, the<br>
problem arises of interference from dynamic scenarios in Java<br>
mode. For example, if button commands embedded in a stream<br>
are supplied to modules when executing playback controls in<br>
Java mode, Java mode dynamic scenarios and button commands<br>
end up being executed at the same time, inviting player errors .<br>
With the present embodiment, which resolves this problem,<br>
PlayItems are provided with a filter specification function.<br>
Filter specification refers to distinguishing between<br>
playable and unplayable elementary streams multiplexed on<br>
an AVClip.<br>
Fig.34 shows an internal structure of a PlayItem<br>
pertaining to embodiment 5. "Playable_PID_entries" has been<br>
added in Fig.34. The leader hp1 in Fig.34 highlights the<br>
structure of Playable_PID_entries. As revealed below,<br>
Playable_PID_entries enumerates PID elementary streams for<br>
playback.<br>
The following description relates to which playback<br><br>
controls are realized by filter specifications in PlayItems .<br>
Fig.35 shows the hierarchical structure of PLs in which<br>
playback controls are performed by Java objects. The MOVIE<br>
object at level 4 in Fig.35 includes a command (PlayPL (PL#1) )<br>
for having PL#1 played. PlayItem#3 of the three PlayItems<br>
#1, #2 and #3 structuring PL#1 includes Playable_PID_entries,<br>
meaning that filter specification is possible.<br>
The Java object at level 4 in Fig.35 includes a command<br>
(PlayPL(PL#2)) for having PL#2 played. PlayItem#12 of the<br>
two PlayItems structuring PL#2 includes<br>
Playable_PID_entries, meaning that filter specification is<br>
possible.<br>
Fig.36 shows what filter specifications are performed<br>
by Playable_PID_entries in PlayItems #3 and #12. In Fig.36,<br>
ACCESS UNITs structuring an AVClip are shown at the bottom,<br>
and two PlayItems #3 and #12 are shown at the top. One video<br>
stream, three audio streams, two presentation graphics<br>
streams, and one interactive graphics stream are multiplexed<br>
in the ACCESS UNITs. A "Video_PID" PID is appended to the<br>
video stream, "Audio_PID" PIDs are appended to the audio<br>
streams, "P.Graphics_PID" PIDs are appended to the<br>
presentation graphics streams, and "I.Graphics_PID" PIDs are<br>
appended to the interactive graphics streams. Of the three<br>
audio streams, the one having "Audio_PID1" appended is<br>
English audio (0:English), the one having "Audio_PID2"<br><br>
appended is Japanese audio (1:Japanese), and the one having<br>
"Audio_PID3" appended is Commentary audio (2:Commentary).<br>
Of the two presentation graphics streams, the one having<br>
"P.Graphics_PID1" appended is English audio (0:English) , and<br>
the one having "P.Graphics_PID2" appended is Japanese audio<br>
(1:Japanese).<br>
PlayItems #3 and #12 at the top of Fig.36 have different<br>
filter specifications. The enumeration of squares in<br>
PlayItems #3 and #12 are the actual content of<br>
Playable_PID_entries, PlayItem#3 being set to allow playback<br>
of the Video_PID video stream, the Audio_PIDl and Audio_PID2<br>
audio streams, the P.Graphics_PIDl and P.Graphics_PID2<br>
presentation graphics streams, and the I.Graphics_PID<br>
interactive graphics stream. PlayItem#12 is set to allow<br>
playback of the Video_PID video stream, and the Audio_PID3<br>
audio stream. When playing PlayItem#3, Playable_PID_entries<br>
in PlayItem#3 are set to PID filter 4 in the playback device.<br>
As a result, PID filter 4 outputs the Video_PID video stream<br>
to video decoder 5, outputs the Audio_PID1 and Audio_PID2<br>
audio streams to audio decoder 7, and outputs the<br>
P.Graphics_PID1 and P.Graphics_PID2 presentation graphics<br>
streams as well as the I.Graphics_PID interactive graphics<br>
stream to graphics decoder 9. Since PlayItem#3 is set so that<br>
all of the graphics streams are playable, playback of all<br>
of the graphics streams multiplexed on the AVClip is<br><br>
possible.<br>
On the other hand, since PlayItem#12 is set so that not<br>
all of the graphics streams are playable, controls using Java<br>
language are possible without there being interference from<br>
dynamic scenarios in Java mode.<br>
Fig.37 shows possible playback outputs resulting from<br>
Playable_PID_entries in PlayIterns #3 and #12. Since playback<br>
of the Video_PID video stream, the Audio_PID1 and Audio_PID2<br>
audio streams, the P.Graphics_PID1 and P.Graphics_PID2<br>
presentation graphics streams, and the I.Graphics_PID<br>
interactive graphics stream is possible with PlayItem#3, it<br>
is possible with playback using MOVIE objects to perform<br>
playback output of the video stream following the playback<br>
output of the Audio_PID1 audio stream (i.e. the narration<br>
"She's a captive of her own lies" in Fig.37), the<br>
P.Graphics_PID1 presentation graphics stream (the Japanese<br>
subtitle   and the<br>
I.Graphics_PID interactive graphics stream (CONTINUE? #YES<br>
NO) .<br>
PlayItem#12 is set so that not all of the graphics<br>
streams are playable, making it possible to only perform<br>
playback output of two stream; namely, the Video_PID video<br>
stream and the Audio_PID3 audio stream. If the Java object<br>
instructing the playback of this PlayItem draws a virtual<br>
studio (i.e. the room containing a camera, chair and light<br><br>
in Fig.37) , the Java object for performing the drawing will<br>
receive no interference from commands included in the<br>
graphics streams. It is thus possible to realize Java-mode<br>
specific processing, while avoiding interference from<br>
commands included in graphics streams. The Audio_PID3 audio<br>
stream set to playable by PlayItem#12 is a commentary by the<br>
movie director (i.e. the lines "I take my hat off to her<br>
outstanding acting ability") , and by having such commentary<br>
by the director played in the virtual studio, it is possible<br>
to create the atmosphere of a movie set.<br>
As a result of this Java object, it is possible to listen<br>
to the movie director's comments while playing movie scenes<br>
as background images in a room modeled on a movie studio.<br>
By recording this Title on a BD-ROM as a bonus track<br>
Title, the product value of the BD-ROM can be increased. Using<br>
the filter specification in a PlayItem to record the bonus<br>
track Title on the BD-ROM brings about the following merits .<br>
The commentary of world-renown movie directors is of<br>
definite interest to movie buffs, and exists on currently<br>
available DVDs as something that increases the added value<br>
of the movie work.<br>
While being able to listen to the director' s commentary<br>
is the greatest attraction of this Title, playing movies<br>
scenes as background images also helps to increases Title's<br>
attractiveness. In other words, being able to listen to<br><br>
behind-the-scenes talk relating to the movie production<br>
while viewing highlight scenes from the movie increases the<br>
aura of the commentary. The problem in this case becomes one<br>
of how to handle audio streams relating to the commentary.<br>
The orthodox approach would be to provide movie scenes that<br>
one wants to use as background images separately from the<br>
main feature, and to multiplex these with audio streams so<br>
as to create the bonus track. However, this approach means<br>
that movie scenes for use as background images need to be<br>
recorded on the BD-ROM separately from the main feature,<br>
increasing the number of recording items and creating<br>
capacity-related problems.<br>
Another possible method involves multiplexing audio<br>
streams for the commentary on video streams for the main<br>
feature together with audio streams used in the main feature.<br>
This allows scenes from the main feature to be uses as<br>
background images to the commentary, although the danger here<br>
is that the commentary data will also be heard when playing<br>
the main feature. As such, the filter specification in the<br>
PlayItem structuring the main feature Title is set so that<br>
only the audio stream of the commentary is OFF and any<br>
remaining audio streams are ON. On the other hand, the filter<br>
specification in the PlayItem structuring the bonus Title<br>
is set so that only the audio stream of the commentary is<br>
ON and any remaining audio streams are OFF. By doing this,<br><br>
it is preferable to multiplex all audio streams relating to<br>
the main feature and commentary together on a single AVClip<br>
for recording on a BD-ROM.<br>
Since it is not necessary to create separate AvClips<br>
for the commentary and main feature (i.e. an AvClip only for<br>
audio streams of the main feature, and an AvClip only for<br>
audio streams of the commentary), it is possible to reduce<br>
the number of AVClips for recording on a BD-ROM, and make<br>
authoring easier.<br>
Thus concludes the description of enhancements to a<br>
BD-ROM in embodiment 5. An enhancement to a playback device<br>
in embodiment 5 will now be described.<br>
The processing performed by a playback device in<br>
embodiment 5 is realized by playback control engine 12<br>
executing the processing procedures in Fig.38.<br>
Fig.38 is a flowchart showing the execution procedures<br>
of a PLPlay function performed by playback control engine<br>
12. In this flowchart, PLx is the PL targeted for processing,<br>
PIy is the PI targeted for processing, and ACCESS UNITv is<br>
the ACCESS UNIT targeted for processing. This flowchart<br>
comprises the following procedures: setting the PL specified<br>
by an argument of the PLPlay function as PLx, reading PLx<br>
to memory (step S61) , identifying the PI targeted for<br>
processing (steps S62 to S64), and reading the ACCESS UNIT<br>
structuring this PI (steps S65 to S76).<br><br>
Step S62 is a judgment as to whether there is a PI<br>
argument specification. if there is an argument<br>
specification, playback control engine 12 sets Ply to the<br>
argument specified PI, and sets PIz to the same argument<br>
specified PI (step S63) . PIz is the PI defining the end of<br>
the reading range. Both PIy and PIz are set to the argument<br>
specified PI because of it only being necessary to read this<br>
PI in the case of a PI being specified by an argument.<br>
If there is no argument specification, playback control<br>
engine 12 sets PIy to the head PI in PLx, and sets PIz to<br>
the last PI in PLx (step S64).<br>
Steps S65 to S76 show the reading of an ACCESS UNIT<br>
structuring Ply, and a decoding procedure. This procedure<br>
involves setting Playable_PID_entries in PIy to PID filter<br>
4 (step S65), setting ACCESS UNITv that includes the In-point<br>
video frame in Ply from the EP_map (step S66) , instructing<br>
BD-ROM drive 1 to read ACCESS UNITv (step S67), and then,<br>
after passing through the judgments of steps S68 to S69,<br>
instructing video decoder 5 to decode video frames included<br>
in ACCESS UNITv (step S70) , and setting ACCESS UNITv to the<br>
next ACCESS UNIT (step S71). After that the processing of<br>
steps S67 to S71 is repeated for all of the ACCESS UNITs<br>
belonging to Ply.<br>
Step S68 is a judgment as to whether ACCESS UNITv<br>
includes the In-point video frame. If the In-point video<br><br>
frame is included (step S68=YES), playback control engine<br>
12 instructs video decoder 5 to decode from the In-point video<br>
frame to the last video frame in ACCESS UNITv (step S72) ,<br>
and moves to step S70.<br>
Step S69 is a judgment as to whether ACCESS UNITv<br>
includes the Out-point video frame. If the Out-point video<br>
frame is included (step S69=YES), playback control engine<br>
12 instructs video decoder 5 to decode from the head video<br>
frame to the Out-point video frame in ACCESS UNITv (step S73)<br>
and releases Playable_PID_entries in PIy from PID filter 4<br>
(step S74) . As a result, the filter specification by PIy is<br>
set to OFF. The step S75 judgment is then performed. Step<br>
S75, which is the final judgment in the flowchart, judges<br>
whether PIy is now PIz. Playback control engine 12 ends the<br>
flowchart if step S75 is YES, and sets PIy to the next PI<br>
if NO (step S76), before returning to step S65. After that<br>
the processing of steps S65 to S77 is repeated until judged<br>
YES at step S75. Thus concludes the description of the<br>
processing procedures performed by playback control engine<br>
12.<br>
Since PlayItems are provided with a filter<br>
specification that sets which of the plurality of elementary<br>
streams multiplexed in an AVClip are playable and which are<br>
unplayable, it is possible according to the present<br>
embodiment to avoid any effects exerted by button commands<br><br>
in elementary streams multiplexed on AVClips as a result of<br>
dynamic scenarios in each mode choosing compatible PlayItems.<br>
As such, Java module 17 no longer receives any interference<br>
from button commands, which contributes to the stable<br>
operation of the playback device.<br>
Embodiment 6<br>
The present embodiment relates to BD-ROM production<br>
processes. Fig.39 is a flowchart showing BD-ROM production<br>
processes pertaining to embodiment 6.<br>
The BD-ROM production processes includes a material<br>
production process S101 for creating materials such as moving<br>
image records and audio records, an authoring process S102<br>
for generating an application format, and a pressing process<br>
S103 for creating the BD-ROM master and pressing/laminating<br>
to complete the BD-ROM.<br>
Of these processes, the authoring process targeting the<br>
BD-ROM comprises the processes of steps S104 to S109.<br>
Scenario editing process S104 is for converting an<br>
outline created in the planning stage into a format<br>
comprehensible to a playback device. The scenario editing<br>
result is created as BD-ROM scenarios. Also, multiplexing<br>
parameters are also created in the scenario editing so as<br>
to realize multiplexing.<br>
Once dynamic scenarios have been competed in the<br><br>
processes, the resume_intension__flag, menu_call_mask,<br>
Title_search_mask of each dynamic scenario is set in step<br>
S105. These settings are performed according to the effects<br>
of SPRMs exerted on playback controls by the dynamic<br>
scenarios. Detrimental effects resulting from menu calls and<br>
title searches during playback are prevented as a result of<br>
these settings.<br>
Material encoding process S106 is a task for<br>
respectively encoding video, audio and sub-video material<br>
to obtain video, and audio and graphics streams.<br>
In multiplexing process S107, video, audio, and<br>
graphics streams obtained as a result of the material<br>
encoding are interleave-multiplexed, and the result is<br>
converted to a single digital stream.<br>
In formatting process S108, various types of<br>
information are created based on BD-ROM-oriented scenarios,<br>
and the scenarios and digital streams are adapted to a BD-ROM<br>
format.<br>
Emulation process S109 is for confirming whether the<br>
authoring result is correct.<br>
Because of being able to describe Java objects and<br>
Webpage objects using Java and markup languages, it is<br>
possible in the authoring processes described above to<br>
develop Java objects and Webpage objects using the same<br>
sensibility as that applied in the development of normal<br><br>
computer-oriented software. Therefore, the present<br>
embodiment has the effect of increasing the efficiency of<br>
scenario creation.<br>
Remarks<br>
The above description by no means shows the<br>
implementation of all configurations of the present<br>
invention. Implementation of the present invention is still<br>
possible according to implementation of configurations that<br>
carry out the following modifications (A) , (B) , (C) , (D) ,<br>
.... The inventions pertaining to the claims of the present<br>
application range from expanded disclosure to generalized<br>
disclosure of the plurality of embodiments disclosed above<br>
and the modified configurations thereof. The degree of<br>
expansion or generalization is based on the particular<br>
characteristics of technical standards in the technical<br>
field of the present invention at the time of application.<br>
However, since the inventions pertaining to the claims<br>
reflect the means for resolving technical issues relating<br>
to the prior art, the technical range of the inventions<br>
pertaining to the claims does not extend beyond the technical<br>
range recognized by those knowledgeable in the art with<br>
respect to resolving technical issues relating to the prior<br>
art. As such, the inventions pertaining to the claims of the<br>
present application possess a material correspondence with<br><br>
the disclosures in the detailed description.<br>
(A) In all of the embodiments, an optical disk<br>
pertaining to the present invention is implemented as a<br>
BD-ROM. However, the optical disk of the present invention<br>
is characterized by the recorded dynamic scenarios and Index<br>
Table, and these characteristics are not dependent on the<br>
physical properties of a BD-ROM. Any form of recording media<br>
is applicable as long as there exists the capacity to record<br>
dynamic scenarios and Index Tables. For example, optical<br>
disks such as DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD+R,<br>
CD-R, CD-RW, and the like, and optical-magnetic disks such<br>
as PD, MO and the like are applicable. Semiconductor cards<br>
such a compact flash cards, PCM-CIA cards and the like are<br>
also applicable, as are (i) magnetic recording disks such<br>
as flexible disks, SuperDisk, Zip, Clik! and the like, and<br>
(ii) removable hard disk drives such as ORB, Jaz, SparQ, SyJet,<br>
EZFley, microdrive and the like. Furthermore, the recording<br>
medium may also be a built-in hard disk.<br>
Dynamic scenarios, Index Tables, and PlayList<br>
information may be recorded on a different recording medium<br>
to AVClips and stream management information. These may then<br>
be read in parallel and played as a single video edit.<br>
(B) Although the playback devices in all of the<br><br>
embodiments output AVClips recorded on a BD-ROM to a TV after<br>
decoding, the playback device may be structured from only<br>
a BD-ROM drive, and the TV may be equipped with all of the<br>
other elements. In this case, the playback device and the<br>
TV can be incorporated into a home network connected using<br>
IEEE1394. Also, although the playback devices in the<br>
embodiments are of a type used after connecting to a<br>
television, integral display-playback devices are also<br>
applicable. Furthermore, the playback device may be only<br>
those parts of the playback devices of the embodiments that<br>
perform essential parts of the processing. Because these<br>
playback devices are all inventions disclosed in the<br>
specification of the present application, acts involving the<br>
manufacture of playback devices based on an internal<br>
structure of the playback devices shown in embodiments 1 to<br>
6 are implementations of the inventions disclosed in the<br>
specification of the present application. Acts that involve<br>
transferring (retail when cost is involved; a gift when no<br>
cost is involved) , lending, or importing of playback devices<br>
shown in embodiments 1 to 6 are also implementations of the<br>
present invention. Acts that involve approaching the general<br>
user about transfer, rental or the like by means of show-widow<br>
displays, catalogue solicitation, pamphlet distribution and<br>
the like are also implementations of these playback devices.<br><br>
(C)	Because of the information processing by computer<br>
programs shown in the flowcharts of Figs.20-22, Fig.28,<br>
Fig.30, Fig.33, and Figs.38 being realized specifically<br>
using hardware resources, computer programs showing the<br>
processing procedures in the flowcharts form an invention<br>
in their own right. Although all of the embodiments show<br>
embodiments that relate to the implementation of computer<br>
programs pertaining to the present invention in an<br>
incorporated form in the playback devices, the computer<br>
programs shown in embodiments 1 to 6 may be implemented in<br>
their own right, separate from the playback devices. The<br>
implementation of the computer programs in there own right<br>
includes acts that involve: (1) production of the programs,<br>
(2) transference of the programs, either gratuitous or<br>
otherwise, (3) lending of the programs, (4) importing of the<br>
programs, (5) providing the programs publicly via<br>
bi-directional electronic communications circuits, and (6)<br>
approaching the general user about transfer, rental and the<br>
like by means of show-widow displays, catalogue solicitation,<br>
pamphlet distribution, and so forth.<br>
(D)	Consider that the element of "time" relating to the<br>
steps executed in time-series in the flowcharts of Figs.20-22,<br>
Fig.28, Fig.30, Fig.33, and Figs.38 is a required item for<br>
specifying the invention. If this is the case, then the<br><br>
processing procedures shown by the flowcharts can be<br>
understood as disclosing the usage configurations of the<br>
playback method. Execution of the processing in the<br>
flowcharts so as to achieve the original objects of the<br>
present invention and to enact the actions and effects by<br>
performing the processing of the steps in time-series is,<br>
needless to say, an implementation of the recording method<br>
pertaining to the present invention.<br>
(E)	With embodiment 5, Menus (ChapterMenu) for<br>
displaying lists of Chapters and MOVIE objects for<br>
controlling the behavior of these Menus may be recorded on<br>
a BD-ROM, and branching enabled from the Top Menu. Also, these<br>
Menus may be called by the depressing of a Chapter key on<br>
a remote controller.<br>
(F)	When recording on a BD-ROM, extension headers<br>
preferably are appended to TS packets structuring AVClips.<br>
The extension headers, which are called TP_extra_header,<br>
include an "Arrival_Time_Stamp" and a<br>
"copy_permission_indicator", and have a 4-byte delta length.<br>
TP_extra_header-attached TS packets (hereinafter,<br>
abbreviated to "EX-attached TS packet") are arranged into<br>
groups of 32 packets, and written into three sectors. Each<br>
group comprising 32 EX-attached TS packets is 6,144 bytes<br>
in length (=32x192), and matches the 6,144-byte size of three<br><br>
sectors (=2048x3) . The grouping of 32 EX-attached TS packets<br>
contained in three sectors is referred to as an "Aligned<br>
Unit".<br>
A playback device 200 transmits Aligned Units in<br>
transmission processing as described below, when used in a<br>
home network connected via IEEE1394. That is, a device on<br>
the side of the sender removes the TP_extra_header from each<br>
of the 32 EX-attached TS packets included in an Aligned Unit,<br>
and outputs the TS packets after encoding the TS packet body<br>
based on a DTCP standard. When outputting TS packets,<br>
isochronous packets are inserted between all adjacent TS<br>
packets. The positioning of isochronous packets is based on<br>
times shown in the Arrival_Time_Stamp in each<br>
TP_extra_header. Playback device 200 outputs a<br>
DTCP_Descriptor following the outputting of the TS packets.<br>
The DTCP_Descriptor shows a copy permissibility setting in<br>
each TP_extra__header. Here, if the DTCP_Descriptor is<br>
described so as to show "copy prohibited", TS packets will<br>
not be recorded on other devices when used in a home network<br>
connected via IEEE1394.<br>
(G) Although digital streams recorded on a recording<br>
medium in the embodiments are AVClips, the digital streams<br>
may be VOBs (Video Objects) complying with a DVD-Video<br>
standard or a DVD-Video Recording standard. VOBs are program<br><br>
streams compliant with ISO/IEC13818-1 obtained by<br>
multiplexing video and audio streams. Also, video streams<br>
in AVClips may be MPEG-4 format, WMV format, or the like.<br>
Furthermore, audio streams may be a Linear-PCM format,<br>
Dolby-AC3 format, MP3 format, MPEG-AAC format, a Dts, or WMA<br>
(Windows media audio).<br>
(H) In the structure of the playback devices, only the<br>
current dynamic scenario is stored in dynamic scenario memory<br>
15 and only current stream management information and current<br>
PL information is stored in the static scenario memory 11.<br>
However, a plurality of scenarios, stream management<br>
information and PL information may be stored in advance, as<br>
with cache memory. By doing this, the time lag until reading<br>
this data from the BD-ROM can be shortened. Also, although<br>
BACKUP memory 14 saves the stored values of registers in stack<br>
form, when consideration is given to the relationship with<br>
memory size, it is realistic to arrange the stored values<br>
for saving on the one level.<br>
(I) Movie works in the embodiments may be obtained by<br>
encoding analog video signals broadcast by analog broadcast,<br>
or may be stream data constituted from transport streams<br>
broadcast by digital broadcast.<br>
Also, contents may be obtained by encoding<br><br>
analog/digital video signals recorded on videotape.<br>
Furthermore, contents may be obtained by encoding<br>
analog/digital video signals taken directly from a video<br>
camera. Alternatively, the contents may be digital<br>
copyrighted works distributed from a distribution server.<br>
(J) Java module 17 may be a Java platform installed in<br>
a device in order to transmit satellite broadcasts. If Java<br>
module 17 is this Java platform, a playback device pertaining<br>
to the present invention shares processing as MHP-use STBs.<br>
Furthermore, Java module 17 may be a Java platform<br>
installed in a device in order to perform mobile telephone<br>
processing controls. If Java module 17 is this Java platform,<br>
a playback device pertaining to the present invention shares<br>
processing as a mobile telephone.<br>
Also, BROWSER module 18 may be computer-installed<br>
Browser software such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and<br>
the like.<br>
(K) In the layer model shown in the drawings, Browser<br>
mode and MOVIE mode may be disposed over Java mode.<br>
Particularly because of the light burden on the playback<br>
device of the execution of control procedures based on<br>
dynamic scenarios, the interpretation of dynamic scenarios<br>
in MOVIE mode, and the like, no problems arise even when MOVIE<br><br>
mode is executed over Java mode. Also, when developing<br>
playback devices and movie works, operation assurance can<br>
be dealt with in a single mode.<br>
Furthermore, Java mode processing may be executed only<br>
in Java mode, without providing three modes. As shown in<br>
embodiment 2, since playback controls synchronized with PL<br>
playback are possible even in Java mode, the necessity of<br>
providing MOVIE mode is removed. Furthermore, controls in<br>
dynamic scenario may be only MOVIE mode or only Browser mode.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Recording media and playback devices pertaining to the<br>
present invention are capable of imparting interactive<br>
controls on movie works, thus making it possible to supply<br>
the market with movie works having high added value and to<br>
invigorate the markets for movies, consumer appliances, and<br>
the like. As such, recording media and playback devices<br>
pertaining to the present invention are highly applicable<br>
in the movie and consumer appliance industries.<br><br>
