DESCRIPTION<br>
Polyester Resin for Toner, Method for Producing Same, and Toner Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polyester resin for toner, to a process for its production and to toner. Background Art [0002]<br>
In methods for obtaining images by electrophotographic printing and electrostatic development, electrostatic charge images formed on photosensitive materials are fixed after being developed by toner that has been electrified by friction.  Fixing systems include heat roller systems that fix developed toner images using pressurized heated rollers, and non-contact fixing systems whereby fixing is accomplished using electric ovens or flash beam light, [0003]<br>
For these processes to be performed smoothly/ the toner must firstly be able to hold a stable electrostatic charge, and secondly must satisfactorily fix onto paper. Also, since the apparatus has a heating element in the fusing section that causes the temperature in the apparatus to increase, the toner must be one that does not undergo blocking in the apparatus, [0004]<br>
The increasing emphasis on reducing energy consumption in recent years has spurred advances in the area of reducing temperatures in the fusing sections in heat roller systems.  This has resulted in greater demand for toner with the ability to affix to paper at low temperature, also known as low temperature fixability. In addition, offset resistance is considered a standard requirement in consideration of the offset phenomenon that occurs in heat roller systems.  It is therefore<br><br>
necessary for toner to exhibit low-temperature fixability whereby it becomes fixed to paper under conditions with a<br>
fixing temperature of 140°C, for example, while maintaining offset resistance, while toner is also desired which has a wider working range, such as a fixing<br>
temperature range of 50°C or above.<br>
[0005]<br>
Toner binding resins have a major effect on the aforementioned toner properties and include polystyrene resins, styrene-acrylic resins, polyester resins, epoxy resins, polyamide resins and the like, among which polyester resins have attracted particular interest recently in light of more easily obtaining balance between transparency and fixability.<br>
[0006]<br>
It has been attempted in the past to broaden the fixing temperature range of polyester resins by using non-linear polyester resins having three-dimensional orosslinked structures comprising trifunctional or greater monomers (for example, see Patent document 1). However, while the non-linear polyester resins disclosed in Patent document 1 have excellent high-temperature offset resistance and exhibit a high maximum fixing temperature, the level of low-temperature fixability has not been satisfactory.<br>
[0007]<br>
Means for improving the low-temperature fixability have been investigated using linear polyester resins composed of divalent carboxylic acid compounds and divalent alcohol compounds (for example, see Patent document 2).     However, linear polyester resins without a three-dimensional structure exhibit poor high-temperature offset resistance despite their excellent low-temperature fixability, and as a result the fixing temperature range is not very broad. 10008]<br>
It has also been attempted to introduce unsaturated<br><br>
groups into linear polyester rssins for reaction and crosslinking with polymerization initiators (for example, see Patent documents 3-6). [0009]<br>
Patent document 3, for example, describes a technique involving crosslinking reaction of an unsaturated polyester resin composed of a divalent carboxylic acid such as isophthalic acid or maleic anhydride and a divalent alcohol such as bisphenol A propylene oxide addition product/ using dicumyl peroxide as the polymerization initiator.  Toner employing crosslinked polyester resins obtained in such a manner are characterized by favorable fixability and absence of the -marking back- phenomenon, but the large amount of organic peroxide used, about 0.5-20 mass% with respect to the resin, results in significant residue of decomposition products in the resin and a lower storage stability* [0010]<br>
Patent document 4 describes crosslinking reaction of an unsaturated polyester resin composed of fumaric acid with bisphenol A propylene oxide addition product or the like to obtain a toner resin that includes a crosslinked fraction and non-crosslinked fraction.  The toner described in Patent document 4, however, has a major drawback of low durability, [0011]<br>
Patent document 5 describes a toner resin obtained by heating an unsaturated polyester resin having a number-average molecular weight of 1,000-4,000 and an unsaturated double bond, or further curing it in the presence of a polymerization initiator.  The toner described in Patent document 5, however, has an unsa-isfactory fixing range. [0012]<br>
The ~oner described in Patent document 6 is composed of the product of crosslinking an unsaturated polyester<br><br>
resin and a saturated polyester resin with a melt start temperature of between 50°C  and 100°C,  The toner has a<br>
wide non-offSet range but insufficient image fixing<br>
strength at low temperatures of 14 0°C and below. [0013]<br>
Therefore, no polyester resin for toner exists that can produce a toner with excellent high-temperature offset resistance together with a wide fixing range of<br>
50°C and above, sufficient fixing strength even at fixing<br>
temperatures of i40°C and below, and satisfactory storage<br>
stability and durability.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0023]<br>
The first aspect of the invention is a polyester resin for toner (1) with a peak molecular weight of at least 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography and conta:Lning an unsaturated double bond. [0024]<br>
The term -unsaturated double, bond- used here refers to a double bond between carbon atoms, vjhich may be on the main chain and/or a side chain of the polyester resin.  For an unsaturated double bond on the main chain and/or side chain of the polyester resin, a carboxylic acid compound with an unsaturated double bond and/or an<br><br>
alcohol compound with an unsaturated double bond may be used for polycondenscition reaction to incorporate these compounds as constituent components of the polyester resin. [0025]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the carboxylic acid compound with an unsaturated double bond, and as examples there may be mentioned fumaric acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid and their ester derivatives, and acrylic acid, crotonic acid, methacrylic acid and their ester derivatives.  There are also no particular restrictions on the alcohol compound with an unsaturated double bond, and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-butene may be mentioned as an example. [0026]<br>
Trom the viewpoint of reactivity, one or more selected from among fumaric acid, maleic acid and maleic anhydride are particularly preferred, [0027]<br>
The unsaturated double bond content is not particularly restricted, but when the unsaturated double bond-containing constituent component is a carboxylic acid compound it is preferably used at 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1), and when the unsaturated double bond-containing constituent component is an alcohol compound, it is preferably used at 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1).  When both are used, their total is preferably 1-50 parts by mol. An unsaturated double bond content of 1 part by mol or greater will tend to produce toner with satisfactory high-temperature offset resistance and permit an effective crosslinking reaction to take place as described below.  An unsaturated double bond content of no greater than 50 parts by mol will tend to produce a toner with a satisfactory shelf life, while producing<br><br>
crosslinking components that are soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the crosslinking reaction described hereunder.  The lower limit for the content is more preferably 3 parts by mol and most preferably 5 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is more preferably 45 parts by mol, even more preferably 40 parts by mol, particularly preferably 35 parts by mol and most preferably 30 parts by mol. [0028]<br>
Polyester resin (1) may also contain as a constituent component in addition to the carboxylic acid compound with an unsaturated double bond and/or alcohol compound with an unsaturated double bond mentioned above, also a component derived from a divalent carboxylic acid compound with no unsaturated double bond and a divalent alcohol compound with no unsaturated double bond, [0029]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the divalent carboxylic acid compound with no unsaturated double bond, and as examples there may be mentioned dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, orthophthalic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, methaconic acid, citraconic acid, glutaconic acid, cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, alkenylsuccinic acid, malonic acid and linoleic acid; as well as their alkyl esters (monomethyl esters, dimethyl esters, monoethyl esters, diethyl esters, monobutyl esters or dibutyl esters); and their dicarboxylic acid anhydrides.  These divalent carboxylic acid compounds may be used alone or in combinations of two or more, [0030]<br>
Preferred among these from the viewpoint of handleability and cost are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and their alkyl esters.  Terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid are especially preferred because of their high reactivity with carboxylic acid compounds lacking unsaturated double bonds, and because they tend<br><br>
to result in satisfactory toner durability. [0031]<br>
The content of the constituent component derived from a divalent carboxylic acid compound with no unsaturated double bond is not particularly restricted, but is preferably at least 50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1) . A content of at least 50 parts by mol will tend to yield a polyester resin with satisfactory production stability, while producing crosslinking components that are soluble in THF in the crosslinking reaction described hereunder. The lower limit for the content is more preferably 55 parts by mol, even more preferably 60 parts by mol, particularly preferably 65 parts by mol and most preferably 70 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is not particularly restricted but is preferably 99 parts by mol, even more preferably 97 parts by mol and most preferably 95 parts by mol. [0032]<br>
The divalent alcohol compound with no unsaturated double bond is not particularly restricted, and as examples there may be mentioned divalent aromatic alcohols such as polyoxyethylene-(2.0)-2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxypropylene-(2.0)-2, 2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxypropylene(2.2)-polyoxyethylene-(2.0),2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxypropylene (6) -2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxypropylene(2.3)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and polyoxypropylene(3,3),2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; divalent aliphatic alcohols such as ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1, 3-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, diethylene glycol, 2-methyl-1, 3-'propanediol, triethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,lO-decanediol and 1,12-dodecanediol; or 1,2-cyclohexanedimethanoi, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethancl, bisphenol hydride A, bisphenol hydride A ethylene oxide addition product and divalent<br><br>
alicyclic alcohols such as propylene oxide addition product, spiroglycol; 1,4-cyclohexanediol, cyclodecanedimethanol and tricyclodecanedimethanolr any of which may be used alone or in combinations of two or more,<br>
[0033]<br>
Preferred among the above as con3tituent components for polyester resin (1) are divalent aliphatic alcohol compounds and/or divalent alicyclic alcohol compounds. Adding a divalent aliphatic alcohol, compound and/or divalent alicyclic alcohol compound as a constituent component in polyester resin (1) will tend to result in a much more satisfactory low-temperature fixabiiity of the toner.  Ethylene glycol and neopentyl glycol are particularly preferred among the aforementioned divalent aliphatic alcohol compounds.  A particularly preferred divalent alicyclic alcohol compound is 1/4-cyclohexanedimethanol.<br>
[0034]<br>
From the viewpoint of achieving an effective crosslinking reaction, 1, 4'-Cyclohexanedimethanol is most preferred among the above.<br>
[0035]<br>
The content of the constituent component derived from a divalent alcohol compound with no unsaturated bond is not particularly restricted, but is preferably at least 80 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1).  A content of 80 parts by mol or greater will tend to result in a polyester resin with more satisfactory production stability. The lower limit for the content is more preferably 90 parts by mol and most preferably 95 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is not particularly restricted but it preferably 150 parts by mol, more preferably 140 parts by mol, even more preferably 130 parts by mol and most preferably 120 parts by mol.<br>
[0036]<br><br>
The content of the constituent component derived from a divalent aliphatic alcohol compound and/or a divalent alicyclic alcohol compound is not particularly restricted, taut is preferably at least 50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1),  A content of at least 50 parts by mol will tend to result in a toner with a more satisfactory low-temperature fixability.  The lower limit for the content is more preferably 60 parts by mol and most preferably 70 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is not particularly restricted but is preferably 150 parts by mol. [0037]<br>
Polyester resin (1) may also contain as a constituent component, in addition to the constituent component derived from a carboxylic acid compound with an unsaturated double bond and/or alcohol compound with an unsaturated double bond, and the constituent component derived from a divalent carboxylic acid compound with no unsaturated double bond and a divalent alcohol compound with no unsaturated double bond, also a constituent component derived from a monovalent carboxylic acid compound and/or monovalent alcohol compound and a constituent component derived from a trivalent or greater carboxylic acid compound and/or a trivalent or greater alcohol compound. [0038]<br>
As monovalent carboxylic acid compounds there may be mentioned aromatic carboxylic acids with up to 30 carbon atoms such as benzoic acid and p-methylbenzoic acid, and aliphatic carboxylic acids with up to 30 carbon atoms Such as stearic acid and behenic acid. [0039]<br>
As monovalent alcohol compounds there may be mentioned a romatic alcohols with up to 30 carbon atoms such as benzyl alcohol, and aliphatic alcohols witli up to 30 carbon atoms such as lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol,<br><br>
stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol and the like. [0040]<br>
The content of the constituent component derived from a monovalent carboxylic acid compound is not particularly restricted, but is preferably at least 0.1-10 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1).  The content of the constituent component derived from a monovalent alcohol compound is not particularly restricted, but is preferably at least 0.1-10 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1),  When both are used, their total is preferably 0.1-10 parts by mol.  If the content of the constituent component derived from a monovalent carboxylic acid compound and/or monovalent alcohol compound is at least 0,1 part by mol it will be easier to control the molecular weight of the polyester resin, and if it is no greater than 10 parts by mol the toner storage stability will tend to be increased.  The lower limit for the content is more preferably 0,2 part by mol and most preferably 0,5 part by mol.  The upper limit for the content is more preferably 9 parts by mol and most preferably 8 parts by mol, [0041]<br>

If the content of the constituent component derived from a trivelent or greater carboxylic acid compound and/or trivalent or greater alcohol compound is at least 0.1-part by mol the toner will tend to exhibit satisfactory high-temperature offset resistance, while if it is no greater than 30 parts by mol the low-temperature fixability of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory.  The lower limit for the content is more preferably 0,5 part by mol and most preferably 1 part by mol.  The upper limit for the content is more preferably 25 parts by mol and most preferably 10 parts by mol. [0044]<br>
Polyester resin (1) has a peak molecular weight (Mp) of at least 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography (GPC).  A peak molecular weight of 12,000 or higher will tend to result in sufficient fixing strength even at low<br>
fixing temperatures of 140°C and below while maintaining satisfactory high-temperature offset resistance-[0045]<br>
According to the invention, the peak molecular weight (Mp) in GPC is the molecular weight determined from the peak value of the elution curve obtained by GPC , measurement.  The measuring conditions for GPC were as follows. [0046] Apparatus; HLC8020, Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd,<br>

If the Mn of polyester resin (1) is at least 4,500, the fixing strength will tend to be sufficient even at low fixing temperatures of below 140°C.  The upper limit for the Mn of polyester resin (1) is not particularly restricted but is preferably 100,000 from the viewpoint of the low-temperature fixability of the toner, [0052]<br>
Polyester resin (1) may be a straight-chain resin or a branched or reticulated resin resulting from a trivalent or greater carboxylic acid compound or trivalent or greater alcohol compound-  It may also consist of a mixture of a straight-chain resin and a branched or reticulated resin. [0053]<br>
The softening temperature of polyester resin (1) is<br>
not particularly restricted but is preferably 120-230°C, A  polyester resin (1) with a softening temperature of at<br>

[0055]<br>
The acid value of polyester resin (1) is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 10 mgKOH/g.  If the acid value of polyester resin (1) is no greater than 10 mgKOH/g, the toner will tend to exhibit more satisfactory fixed image density.  The upper limit for the acid value of polyester resin (1) is more preferably no greater than 8 mgKOH/g.  The lower limit for the acid value of polyester resin (1) is not particularly restricted but is preferably 0.1 mgKOH/g, [0056]<br>
The second aspect of the invention will now be explained,<br>
[00571<br>
The second aspect of the invention is a polyester resin for toner obtained by crosslinking reaction of polyester resin for toner (1) which has a peak molecular weight of at least 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography and contains an unsaturated double bond. [0058]<br>
Polyester resin (1) may be used directly as a toner binding resin, but it is preferably subjected to crosslinking reaction.     [0059]<br>
When polyester resin (1) is crosslinked, a portion<br><br><br>
The polyester resin for toner obtained by crosslinking reaction of polyester resin (1) <br><br>
a polyester resin {1) having a peak molecular weight of 12,000 or greater in gel permeation chromatography and comprising no unsaturated double bond. [0062]<br>
The third aspect of the invention will now be explained. [0063]<br>
The third aspect of the invention is a polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin for toner (1) with a peak molecular weight of at least 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography and containing an unsaturated double bond, and polyester resin for toner (2) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography. [0064]<br>
Polyester resin (1) may be used alone as a toner binding resin, but preferably it is used in combination with polyester resin (2) having a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000,  Using a combination of polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) as the toner binding resin will tend to yield a toner with a more satisfactory low-temperature fixability.  Presumably this is because polyester resin (2) melts sharply at low temperature, [0065]<br>
The upper limit for the peak molecular weight of polyester resin (2) is preferably 11,000 and most preferably 10,000.  The lower limit for the peak molecular weight of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably 2,000 from the viewpoint of the storage stability of the toner. [0066]<br>
The Mw of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 12,000 from the viewpoint of the low-temperature fixability of the toner.' The upper limit for the Mw of polyester resin (2) is most preferably 11,000,  The lower limit for the Mw of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is<br><br>
preferably 4,000 from the viewpoint of the storage<br>
stability of the toner-<br>
[0067]<br>
The Mn of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 4,500'from the viewpoint of the low-temperature fixability of the toner.  The upper limit for the Mn of polyester resin (2) is most preferably 4,000.  The lower limit for the Mn of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably 1,000 from the viewpoint of the storage stability of the toner. [0068]<br>
The softening temperature of polyester resin (2) is<br>
not particularly restricted but is preferably 80-130°C. The lower limit for the softening temperature of polyester resin (2) is more preferably 85°C and most<br>
preferably 90°C.  The upper limit for the softening temperature of polyester resin (2) is more preferably<br>
120,C and most preferably 115°C. [0069]<br>
The Tg of polyeste,r resin (2) is not particularly<br>
restricted but is preferably in the range of 40-70°C,  A polyester resin (2) with a Tg of at least 40°C will tend to result in a toner with satisfactory storage stability, while a Tg of no higher than 70°C will tend to result in a toner with satisfactory low-temperature fixability.  The lower limit for the Tg of polyester resin (2) is more<br>
preferably 45°C and the upper limit is more preferably<br>
[0070]<br>
The acid value of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 50 mgKOH/g,  If the acid value of polyester resin (2) is no greater than 50 mgKOH/g, the toner will tend to exhibit a more satisfactory fixed image density.  The upper limit for the acid value of polyester resin (2) is<br><br>
more preferably no greater than 40 mgKOH/g.  The lower limit for the acid value of polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted taut is preferably 1 mgKOH/g. [0071]<br>
The constituent components of polyester resin (2) are not particularly restricted, and there may be used the same components mentioned above as examples of constituent components for polyester resin (1),  There may.also be used divalent carboxylic acid compounds with unsaturated double bonds, divalent carboxylic acid compounds with no unsaturated bonds, dihydric alcohol compounds with unsaturated bonds, dihydric alcohol compounds with no unsaturated bonds or trivalent carboxylic acid compounds, trihydric alcohol compounds, monovalent carboxylic acid compounds and monohydric alcohol compounds with no unsaturated bonds, which were mentioned above as examples of constituent components for polyester resin (1),  The preferred range for the content of these constituent components in polyester resin (2) is the same as the preferred range for the constituent components in polyester resin (1) specified above. [0072]<br>
However, the preferred types of constituent components in the polyester resin differ for polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2).  For example, preferred dihydric alcohol components for polyester resin (2), from the viewpoint of storage stability, are bisphenol A propylene oxide addition products such as polyoxypropylene-(2,0)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxypropylene(6)-2,2-bis{4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, polyoxyprcpylene(2.3)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and polyoxypropylene(3.3)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propene, while neopentyl glycol is preferred from the viewpoint of the low-temperature fixability. [0073]<br>
Polyester resin (2) preferably contains a constituent, component derived from a C30 or greater<br><br>
monovalent carboxylic acid compound and/or C30 or greater monohydric alcohol compound.  If polyester resin (2) contains a C30 or greater monovalent carboxylic acid compound and/or C30 or greater monohydric alcohol compound as a constituent component, the dispersibility of the release agent added during toner production will generally be more satisfactory, the high-temperature offset resistance can be improved and the fixing range will tend to be broader. [0074]<br>
The following industrially available compounds may be mentioned as C30 or greater monovalent carboxylic acid compounds and/or C30 or greater monohydric alcohol compounds, although they are not restrictive. [0075]<br>
(i) Compounds with a hydroxyl group at one end of C30 or greater polyethylene.  For example,  compounds among the Uniline series by Toyo Petr,olite which have number-average molecular weights of 438 and greater. [0076]<br>
(ii) Compounds with a carboxyl group at one end of C30 or greater polyethylene,     For example, compounds among the Unisid series by Toyo Petrolite which have number-average molecular weights of 438 and greater. [0077]<br>
(iii) Compounds based on polypropylene with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 1000 (~C70) which are maleic acid-,modified at one end. [0078]<br>
Polyester resin (2) may be a polyester resin with an unsaturated double bond or a saturated polyester resin with no unsaturated double bonds,<br>
[0079]<br>
The difference in softening temperature between polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) is not<br>
particularly restricted but is preferably ar least 20°C.<br><br>
A softening temperature difference of at least 20°C will tend to result in a toner with a satisfactory balance between low-teznperature fixability and high-temperature<br>
offset resistance.  The lower limit for the softening<br>
temperature difference is more preferably at least 40'C<br>
and especially at least 50°C.  The upper limit for the softening temperature difference is not particularly<br>
restricted but is preferably no more than 150°C. [0080]<br>
The mixing proportion of polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted, but is preferably 1/99-99/1 (by mass).  A mixing proportion within this range will tend to yield a toner with satisfactory low-temperature fixability.  The mixing proportion is more preferably 1/99-50/50, even more preferably 1/99-40/50, yet more preferably 1/99-30/70, even yet more preferably 1/99-20/80 and most preferably, 5/95-20/80. [0081]<br>
The difference in the solubility parameter (SP value) between polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted but is preferably nc greater than 1.  A difference in SP of no greater than 1 (cal/cm',) ,,, will tend to yield a polyester resin with satisfactory miscibility and a better balance between low-temperature fixability and storage stability.  The difference in SP is more preferably 0.8 (cal/cm',) ,1/2 ever, more preferably no greater than 0,6 (cal/cm-,) -,,, andmost. preferably no greater than 0.4 {cal/cm3)1/2 [0082]<br>
Ths SP value is calculated according to the known Fedors method, ignoring the end groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, etc,} since the ends of the polyester molecute chain have minimal effect on solubility. [0083]<br>
According to the invention/ a crystalline polyested<br><br>
may be used as the binding resin in the toner, but from the viewpoint of achieving more favorable toner fixability, polyester resin [1]   and polyester resin (2) are preferably both amorphous polyester resins with no melting point, [0084]<br>
The fourth aspect of the invention will now be<br>
explained. [0085]<br>
The fourth aspect of the invention is a polyester resin for toner obtained by crosslinking reaction of a polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin for toner (1) with a peak molecular weight of at least 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography and containing an unsaturated double bond, and polyester resin for toner (2) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography. [0086]<br>
The polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) may be used directly as the toner binding resin, but it is preferably subjected to crosslinking reaction. [0087]<br>
When the polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) is crosslinked, a portion thereof is converted to a crosslinked fraction with high crosslink density that is incapable of dissolving in THF (THF-insoluble fraction) and a portion thereof is converted to a crosslinked fraction with low crosslink density that dissolves in THF, while the rest remains unreacted.  A resin obtained by crosslinking reaction therefore contains a THF-insoluble fraction {crosslinked fraction that is insoluble in THF) and a THF-soluble fraction (crosslinked fraction that is soluble in THF, and the unreacted polyester resin (1) and unreacted polyester resin (2)). [0088]<br><br>
The unreacted polyester resin (2) in the THF-soluble fraction acts to impart low-temperature fixability to the toner.  The unreacted polyester resin (1) in the THF-soluble fraction acts to impart elasticity to the toner. Because the THF-insoluble fraction is crosslinked at high density, it results in a toner with an even higher elastic modulus.  The crosslinked components in the THF-soluble fraction that dissolve in THF result in more satisfactory compatibility between the THF-insoluble fraction and the unreacted polyester resin (1) and unreacted polyester resin (2}. [0089]<br>
Consequently, a polyester resin for toner obtained by crosslinking reaction of a polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) maintains satisfactory low-temperature fixability while exhibiting increased high-temperature offset resistance and a markedly broader fixing temperature range. [0090]<br>
For crosslinking reaction of the polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2), it is preferred for polyester resin (2) to contain an unsaturated double bond.  When polyester resin (2) contains an unsaturated double bond, polyester resin (2) will also be incorporated into the crosslinked components, tending to result in a smaller THF-insoluble fraction and more satisfactory toner storage stability and durability, [0091]<br>
The size of the THF-insoluble fraction can be controlled by adjusting the number of unsaturated double bonds in polyester resin (2) and the content of polyester resin (2).  The number of unsaturated double bonds in polyester resin (2) is preferably no greater than the number or unsaturated double bonds in polyester resin (1),  If the number of unsaturated bonds in polyester resin (2) is no greater than the number of unsaturated<br><br>
bonds in polyester resin (1), the storage stability and durability will tend to be more satisfactory while the balance between low-temperature fixability and high-temperature offset resistance will be maintained. [0092]<br>
The fifth aspect of the invention will now be explained, [0093]<br>
The fifth aspect of the invention is a polyester resin for toner comprising a THF-soluble fraction and a THF-insoluble fraction, wherein the ratio of the mass-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average molecular weight (Mn) (Mw/Mn) of the THF-soluble fraction is 6 or greater and the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, [0094]<br>
The THF-soluble fraction is the component that elutes into THF when the polyester resin is dissolved in THF under reflux, and the THF,insoluble fraction is the component that does not elute into THF under the same conditions. [0095]<br>
The mass,average molecular weight/number,average molecular weight ratio (IMw/Mn) of the THF-soluble fraction is not particularly restricted but is preferably at least 6.  A Mw/Mn of 6 or greater for the THF-soluble fraction corresponds to a broader molecular weight distribution of the THF-soluble fraction, and a Mw/Mn of 6 or greater will tend to result in a toner with particularly satisfactory durability.  The lower limit for the Mw/Mn is preferably 10, more preferably 20 and even more preferably 40.  The upper limit for Mw/Mn of the THF-soluble fraction is not particularly restricted but is preferably 5,000, more preferably 4,000 and even more preferably 3,000. [0096]<br><br>
The THF-soluble fraction is not particularly restricted so long as Mw/Km is 6 or greater, but it preferably has a peak at  molecular weight 10,000 or below, and the ratio of the signal strength of the GPC curve at molecular weight 100,000 (I (MlOO, 000) ) with respect to the signal strength of the GPC curve at peak molecular weight (I(Mp)) (I(MlOO,000)/I(Mp)) is preferably in the range of 0.04-0-2.  The ratio (KMIOO, 000)/I (Mp) ) is an index of the THF-scluble nigh--molecular-,weight component content, and a (KMIOO, 000)/I(Mp)) ratio of 0.04 or greater will :end to result in better compatibility between the TKF-insoluble fraction and THF-soluble low molecular components, as well as more even dispersion of the THF-insoluble fraction and more satisfactory toner durability.  If the (KMIOO,000)/I (Mp) ) ratio is no greater than 0,2, the low-temperature fixability of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory.  The lower limit for this ratio is more preferably 0,05, and the upper limit is more preferably 0,15,<br>
The signal strength of the GPC curve at peak molecular weight (I{Mp)) and the signal strength c: the GPC curve at molecular weight 100,000 (I(MlOO,000)) are, respectively, the difference between the baseline siginal strength and the signal strength at peak molecular weight. and the difference between baseline signal strength and the signal strength at molecular weight 100,000, and they are represented as potentials (mV).<br>
The THF-soluble fraction preferably includes the crosslinked components that dissolve in THF.  If the THI- ■ soluble fraction includes the crosslinked components That. dissolve in THF, the compatibility between the THF-insoluble fraction and the THF-soluble low molecular components will be more satisfactory, the THF-insoluble fraction will disperse more evenly and the toner durability will tend to be further improved. [0097]<br><br>
The acid value of the THF-insoluble fraction is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 15 mgKOH/g, more preferably no greater than 12 ingKOH/g, even more preferably no greater than 10 mgKOE/g  and most preferably no greater than 8 mgKOH/g.  The lower limit for the acid value, likewise, is not particularly restricted but is preferably 0.1 mgKOH/g, [0098]<br>
The hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is also not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 35 mgKOH/g and more preferably no greater than 32 mgKOH/g.  The lower limit for the hydroxyl value, likewise, is not particularly restricted but is preferably 0.1 mgKOH/g. [0099]<br>
The sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 40 mgKOH/g.  If the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, the toner durability will tend to be notably improved*  The upper limit for the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value o£ the THF-insoluble fraction is preferably no greater than 38 ingKOH/g,  The lower limit for the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is also not particularly restricted, but from the standpoint of durability it is preferably at least 0.2 mgKOH/g, more preferably at least 1 mgKOH/g, even more preferably at least 5 mgKOH/g and most preferably at least 10 mgKOH/g.<br>
Since the polyester resin is produced by condensation polymerization of an acid and alcohol as described hereunder, the ends will generally be acid-terminated or alcohol-terminated (hydroxy-terminated) * R smaller molecular weight of the polyester resin (a lower degree of condensation) will therefore increase the number of ends per unit weight and lead to a larger total of the acid value and hydroxyl value.  Conversely, a<br><br>
larger molecular weight of the polyester resin (a higher degree of condensation) will decrease the number of ends per unit weight and lead to a smaller total of the acid value and hydroxyl value.  The THF-insoluble fraction consists of components with a non-linear structure that do not elute in THF, i,e- the high density crosslinked components, [0100]<br>
A THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g therefore corresponds to high-density crosslinking in a high-molecular-weight polyester resin with a high degree of condensation.  Thus, a THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g can result in high-temperature offset resistance with a smaller content to exhibit an effect of both low-temperature fixability and high-temperature offset resistance, as well as a broad fixing temperature range. [Old]<br>
Therefore, when the Mw/Mn of the THF-soluble fraction of the polyester resin for toner is 6 or greater and the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, it is possible to achieve more satisfactory performance including high-temperature offset resistance, low-temperature fixability, fixing temperature range, storage stability and durability. [0102]<br>
The THF-soluble fraction content is not particularly restricted but is preferably no greater than 95 mass% of the binding resin in the toner.  If the THF'-soluble fraction is no greater than 95 mass%, the high-temperature offset resistance of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory.  The upper limit for the THF-soluble fraction content is most preferably no greater than 93 mass%.  The lower limit for the THF-soluble fraction content is also not particularly restricted but<br><br>
is praferataly 60 mass%,  If the THF-soluble fraction is at least 60 mass%, the low-temperature fixability of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory.  The lower limit for the THF-soluble fraction content is most preferably 65 mass%. [0103]<br>
The THF-insoluble fraction content is not particularly restricted but is preferably at least 5 mass% of the binding resin in the toner.  If the THF, insoluble fraction is at least 5 mass%, the high-temperature offset resistance of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory.  The lower limit for the THF-insoluble fraction content is most-preferably 7 mass%. The upper limit for the THF-insoluble fraction content is also not particularly restricted but is preferably 40 mass%.  If the THF-insoluble fraction is no greater than 40 mass,, the low-,temperature fixability of the toner will tend to be more satisfactory-  The upper limit for the THF-insoluble fraction content is most preferably 35 mass%. [0104]<br>
A process for production of a polyester resin for toner according to the invention will now be explained. [0105]<br>
The production process for polyester resin (1) polyester resin (2) is not particularly restricted, and any process known in the prior art may be employed.  For example, the carboxylic acid compound and alcohol compound may be charged together for esterification or transesterification and  polymerization by condensation reaction to produce the polyester resin.  For polymerization of the polyester resin, a polymerization catalyst such as titanium tetrabutoxide, dibutyltin oxide, tin acetate/ zinc acetate,- tin disulfide, antimony trioxide or germanium dioxide may be used.  The polymerization temperature is not particularly restricted but is preferably in the range of 180,C~290°C.  For the<br><br>
Of these reactions, radical addition reaction, cationic addition reaction or anionic addition reaction of the unsaturated double bonds in the polyester resin to form intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds is preferred. [0112]<br>
Radical addition reaction, cationic addition reaction or anionic addition reaction of the unsaturated double bonds in the polyester,resin to form intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds can be accelerated by active species generated by thermal reaction, photoreaction, oxidation-reduction reaction or the like* Thermal reaction is preferred among the above, with radical reaction being especially preferred.  There are no  particular restrictions on the radical reaction, and it may be carried out with or without the use of a radical reaction initiator.  A process using a radical reaction initiator is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of effectively conducting the crosslinking reaction. [0113]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the radical reaction initiator, which may be an azo  compound or organic peroxide.  Organic peroxides are preferred for their high initiator efficiency and lack of cyanogen compound by-products. [0114]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on organic peroxides used, and as examples there may be mentioned benzoyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl<br>
peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, a,a-bis(t-butylperoxy)diisopropylbenzene, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane, di-t-hexyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2, 5-di-t--butylperoxyhexyne-3, acetyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, octanonyl peroxide, decanolyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, 3,3,5-trimethylhexanoyl peroxide, m-toluyl peroxide, t-butylperoxy isobutyrate, t,-butylperoxy neodecanoate, cumylperoxy neodecanoate, t-butylperoxy 2-<br><br>
polyester resin (2) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000, synthesis can be accomplished without using a.   catalyst. [0106]<br>
The carboxylic acid compound and alcohol compound may be charged together with a release agent component for esterification or transesterification and polymerization by condensation reaction to produce the polyester resin, or in other words, internal addition of the release agent component. [0107]<br>
A stabilizer may also be added to stabilize polymerization of the polyester.  As stabilizers there may be mentioned hydroquinone, methylhydroquinoner hindered phenol compounds ,and  the like. [0108]<br>
A process for production of a polyester resin for toner obtained by crosslinking reaction of polyester resin (1) will now be explained. [0109]<br>
The crosslinking reaction of the polyester resin (1) forms chemical bonds between the polyester resin molecules, [0110]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the form of the crosslinking reaction, and for example, the unsaturated double bonds in the polyester resin (1) may be reacted by radical addition reaction, cationic addition reaction or anionic addition reaction to form intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds, or intermolecular bonds may be formed by condensation reaction, polyaddition reaction or transesterification of the tribasic or greater carboxylic acids, trihydric or greater polyhydric alcohols, trivalent or greater epoxy groups or trivalent or greater isocyanate groups in  the polyester resin. [0111]<br><br>
Of these reactions, radical addition reaction, cationic addition reaction or anionic addition reactior. of the unsaturated double bonds in the polyester resin zo form intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds is preferred. [0112]<br>
Radical addition reaction, cationic addition reaction or ■anionic addition reaction of the unsaturateo double bonds in the polyester,resin to form intermolecular carbon-carbon bonds can be accelerated cy active species generated by thermal reaction, photoreaction, oxidation-reduction reaction or the like. Thermal reaction is preferred among the above, with radical reaction being especially preferred.  There are . no particular restrictions on the radical reaction, and it may be carried out with or without the use of a radical reaction initiator.  A process using a radical reaction initiator is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of effectively conducting the crosslinking reaction, [0113]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the radiced reaction initiator, which may be an azo  compound or organic peroxide.  Organic peroxides are preferred fcr their high initiator efficiency and lack of cyanogen compound by-products, [0114]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on organic peroxides used, and as examples there may be mentioned benzoyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-,butylcumy'. peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, a,a-bis(t-butylperoxy)diisopropylben2ene, 2, 5-dimethyl-2, 5-bis (-.-butylperoxy) hexane, di-t-hexyl peroxide, 2,5-dimetr.yl-2,S-di-t-butylperoxyhexyne-3, acetyl peroxide, isobutyrrd peroxide, octanonyl peroxide, decanolyl peroxicie, ia\:iL-:: ■.. peroxide, 3,3,5-trimethylhexanoyl peroxide, m-tcluyi peroxide, t-butylperoxy isobutyrate, t,butylperoxy neodecanoate, cumylperoxy neodecanoate, t-butylpercxv' 1■<br><br>
ethyl hexanoate, t-butylperoxy 3, 5, 5-trimethyl hexanoate, t-butylperoxy laurate, t-butylperoxy benzoate, t-butylperoxyisopropyl carbonate and t-butylperoxy acetate. [0115]<br>
Particularly preferred among the above are reaction initiators with high ability to abstract hydrogen because, they efficiently promote crosslinking reaction and can be used in smaller amounts, and especially reaction initiators with high ability to abstract hydrogen, such as benzoyl peroxide, di,t-butyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl<br>
peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, a,a-bis(t-butylperoxy)diisopropylbenzene, 2, 5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane, di-t-hexyl peroxide and the liKe. [0116]<br>
The amount of radical reaction initiator used is not particularly restricted, but it is preferably O.l-lO parts by mass to 100 parts by mass of polyester resin (1),  A radical reaction initiator used at 0.1 part by mass or greater will tend to promote the crosslinking reaction, while odor will be acceptable at less than 10 parts by mass.  The amount used is preferably no greater than 3 parts by mass, more preferably no greater than 1 part by mass and even more preferably no greater nh,a  0.5 part by mass. [0117]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the crosslinking reaction method, and for example, either of the follov,ing methods (i) or (ii) may be mentioned, (i) A method of conducting crosslinking reaction simultaneously with polymerization of the polyester resin.<br>
(ii) A method of conducting crosslinking reaction ~f-er polymerization of the polyester resin.<br>
Method (ii), conducting crosslinking reaction after polymerization of the polyester resin, is preferred. [0118]<br>
When crosslinking reaction is conducted after<br><br>
polymerization of the polyester resin, the polyester resin may be supplied to the crosslinking reaction while in a molten state immediately after polymerization/, or it may be cooled after polymerization to obtain a solid polyester resin and then remelted for crosslinking reaction.  The crosslinking reaction is not particularly restricted/ and may be carried out with or without a crosslinking reaction initiator.  A crosslinking reaction initiator is preferably used from the viewpoint of effectively conducting the crosslinking reaction, [0119]<br>
There are no  particular restrictions on the method of adding the crosslinking reaction initiator when crosslinking reaction is carried out after polymerization of the polyester resin.  For example, the crosslinking reaction may be conducted with addition of the crosslinking reaction initiator to the polyester resin which is in a molten state immediately after polymerization, the cooled solid polyester resin may be remelted prior to addition of the crosslinking reaction initiator for crosslinking reaction, or the crosslinking reaction initiator may be added to the cooled solid polyester resin before remelting for crosslinking reaction.<br>
When the crosslinking reaction initiator is added to the molten polyester resin, preferably a mixture of the crosslinking reaction initiator in a diluent is prepared and the mixture added to the molten polyester resin. [0120]<br>
There are no particular restrictions when using a radical reaction initiator as the crosslinking reaction initiator.  Addition of the crosslinking reaction initiator which has been diluted with a diluent will help to prevent autodecomposition of the radical reaction initiator, thus ensuring higher safety during the polyester resin production and avoiding excess consumption of the radical reaction initiator due to<br>
)<br><br>
autodecomposition, while also reducing the amount of radical reaction initiator that must be used.<br>
The compound used as the diluent is not particularly restricted, and it may be one of the acid or alcohol compounds used as constituent components of the polyester resin, or a low-moleculdr-weight polyester resin may be used as the diluent.  In addition to these there may be mentioned polyvalent polyalkyl carboxylate esters, phosphoric acid esters, terpene-based resins, rosin-based esters, epoxy-based resins, polyalkylene glycols, silicon oils, release agents and the like, any of which may also be used in combinations of two or more, [0121]<br>
Release agents are particularly preferred among the above.  The diluent will remain in the polyester resin for toner, but since a release agent is used as an additive in the toner it will not adversely affect the toner performance even if it remains in the polyester resin for toner.  By pre-adding the release agent to the polyester resin for toner, it is possible to achieve more satisfactory dispersibility of the release agent than when it is added during formation of the toner.<br>
when a release agent is used as the diluent for the radical reaction initiator, it is preferred to use one that does not inhibit crosslinking reaction of the unsaturated double bonds.  As agents that do not inhibit crosslinking reaction of unsaturated double bonds there are preferred hydrocarbon-based release agents, and as examples there may be mentioned aliphatic hydrocarbon-based waxes such as low-molecular-weight polyethylene, low-molecular-weighr polypropylene, microcrystalline wax and paraffin wax, aliphatic hydrocarbon-based wax oxides such as polyethylene oxide wax and the like, as well as their block compounds. [0122]<br>
The melting point of the release agent is preferably<br>
no higher than 120°C in order to facilitate mixture with<br><br>
the radical reaction initiator, and in order to further increase the low-temperature lixability of the toner* The most preferred release agents with melting points of<br>
120°C and below are paraffin waxes, and as examples there may be mentioned the HNP series, for example, HNP-3 (melting point; 64°C), HNP-5 (melting point; 62°C), HNP-9, 10 (melting point: 75°C), HNP-11 (melting point: 68°C) , HNP-12 (melting point: 67°C) and HNP-51 (melting point: ll',C) r   the SP series, for example, SP-0165 (melting point: 74°C), SP-0160 (melting point: 71°C) , SP-0145 (melting point: 62°C) and HNP-3 (melting point: 64°C) and the FT series: FT-0070 (melting point: 72,C) , FT-0165 (melting<br>

The dilution ratio of the crosslinking reaction initiator (the mixing ratio of the crossiinking reaction initiator and release agent) is not particularly restricted, but preferably the crossiinking reaction initiator/release agent ratio (by mass) is in the range of 0.1/99,9-50/50,  A ratio of 0.1/99.9 or greater will help the crossiinking reaction take place more efficiently, while a ratio of no greater than 50/50 will help prevent autodecomposition.  The time for the crossiinking reaction is preferably set according to the 10 hour half-life temperature of the radical reaction initiator used, and the preferred range is 0,5 minutes-10 minutes from the viewpoint of thermal decomposition reaction of the polyester resin.<br>
The temperature for the crossiinking reaction is also preferably set according to the 10 hour half-life temperature of the radical reaction initiator used, and<br>
the preferred range is 10O°C-25O°C from the viewpoint of<br>
thermal decomposition and crossiinking reactivity of the<br>
polyester resin.<br>
[0124]<br><br>
The apparatus used for crosslinking reaction may be the same apparatus used for the polyester resin polycondensation step, but from the viewpoint of uniform admixture of the polyester resin and crosslinking reaction initiator in a short period of time, it is preferably a melt mixer,<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the melt mixer, and as examples there may be mentioned continuous melt mixers such as single-screw extruders, twin-screw extruders, continuous enclosed mixers, gear extruders, disk extruders, roll mill extruders and static mixers, and batch-type enclosed melt mixers such as Banbury mixers, Brabender mixers and Haake mixers.<br>
Among these, continuous melt mixers are preferred for better efficiency in a short period of time and for dispersion of the crosslinking reaction initiator in the polyester resin-When crosslinking reaction is conducted with addition of the crosslinking reaction initiator to the polyester resin while it is molten immediately after polymerization, the melt mixer is preferably connected to a polycondensation reaction tank, [0125]<br>
A publicly known static mixer may also be used, and the following may be mentioned as industrially available examples.<br>

For crosslinking reaction of the polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2), mixing of polyester resin (1) and polyester resin<br><br>
(2) may be carried out simultansousiy with the crosslinking reaction, or polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) may be mixed first, followed by crosslinking reaction.  From the viewpoint of homogeneity of the obtained resin, the preferred method is mixture of polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) followed by crosslinking reaction. [0127]<br>
For crosslinking reaction of a polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2), it  is preferred to add a structural unit derived from 1, 4'Cyclohexanedimethanol as the constituent component of polyester resin (1), and at least one structural unit selected from among structural units derived from neopentyl glycol, structural units derived from the aforementioned bisphenol A propylene oxide addition products and structural units with unsaturated double bonds, as polyester resin (2).<br>
The amount of radical reaction initiator used is not particularly restricted, but it is preferably 0,1-10 parts by mass to 100 parts by mass as the total of polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2).  A radical reaction initiator used at 0,1 part by mass or greater will tend to promote the crosslinking reaction, while odor will be tolerable at less than 10 parts by mass. The amount used is preferably no greater than 3 parts by mass, more preferably no greater than 1 part by mass and even more preferably no greater than 0.5 part by mass. [0128]<br>
The following explanation regards a production process for a polyester resin for toner comprising a THF-soluble fraction and a THF-insoluble fraction, wherein the ratio of the masS'-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Hn) (Mw/Mn) of the THF-soluble fraction is 6 or greater and the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction is no greater than 40 mgKOH/g.<br><br>
First, a production process for a THF-insoiuble fraction having an acid value and hydroxyl value sun ci no greater than 40 mgKOH/g will be explained.  As mentioned above, the THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g is a component with high-density crosslinking in a high'-molecular-weight polyester resin with a high degree of condensation.  In order to produce a THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, therefore, it is necessary to carry out crosslinking reaction of a.  high-molecular-weight polyester resin with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g. [0129]<br>
The crosslinking method is not particularly restricted and may be crosslinking by reaction of the carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups, or crosslinking by radical reaction.  As examples of crosslinking by reaction of carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups -here may be mentioned reaction of trivalent or greater polyfunctional compounds such as tribasic or greater carboxylic acids. trihydric or greater polyhydric alcohols, trivalent or greater epoxy compounds and trivalent or greater isocyanate compounds.  For crosslinking by radical reaction there may be mentioned addition reaction to unsaturated double bonds using radicals, or hydrogen abstraction using radicals.<br>
For crosslinking by reaction of carboxylic acid of hydroxyl groups, it is necessary to react all of the functional groups in the trivalent or greater polyfunctional compound.  If a portion of the functions-groups of the trivalent or greater polyfunctional compound such as carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups remain without having reacted, the acid value or hydrox' ... value will increase and the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value for -he THF-insoluble fraction will exceed 4 0 mgKOH/g.<br><br>
[0130]<br>
Because it is generally difficult to limit the acid value and hydroxyl value sum of the THF-insoluble fraction to below 40 mgKOH/g by crosslinking using trivalent or greater polyfunctional compounds, the method for limiting the acid value and hydroxyl value sum of the THF-insoluble fraction to no greater than 40 mgKOH/g is preferably addition reaction onto unsaturated double bonds by radicals or hydrogen abstraction by radicals*<br>
As explained above, a THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g can be obtained by crosslinking reaction of a high-molecular-weight polyester resin with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, and for example, the method may be crosslinking reaction of polyester resin (1) having a peak molecular weight of 12,000 or greater. [0131]<br>
A process for production of a THF-soluble fraction with £ mass-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn) ratio (Mw/Mn) of 6 or greater will now be explained.<br>
As mentioned above, a Mw/Mn ratio for the THF-soluble fraction means that the THF-soluble fraction has a wide molecular weight distribution, and the method for achieving a Mw/Mn ratio of 6 or greater for the THF--soluble fraction may be one  of the following two methods.<br>
(a)	A method of blending a high-molecular-weight polyester resin that dissolves in THF with a low-molecular-weight polyester resin that dissolves in THF,<br>
(b)	A method of crosslinking a polyester resin that dissolves in THF to produce a crosslinked component that dissolves in THF.<br>
Method (b) is preferred among the aforementioned methods to efficiently obtain an I(MlOO,000)/I(Mp) value in the range of 0.04-0.2. [0132]<br><br>
More specifically, method (b) may be any of the following three methods.<br>
(b-1) A method of low density crosslinking of a high-molscular-weight polyester resin,<br>
(b-2) A method of crosslinking of a low-molecular-weight polyester resin.<br>
[b--3) A method of crosslinking of a high-molecular-weight polyester resin and a low-molecular-weight polyester resin, [0133]<br>
For method (b-l), a high-molecular-weight polyester rssm may be crosslinked by the method described above, but the crosslink density must be controlled in order to produce a crosslinked component with low crosslink density that dissolves in THF.<br>
For example, when a trivalent or greater polyfunctional compound is used to produce the crosslinked component, a portion of the functional groups may be left without reaction to produce a low-crosslinked component.<br>
When the crosslinked component is produced by radical reaction, the unsaturated double bond content may be controlled to produce a low-crosslinked component, For crosslinking of polyester resin (1), for example, the unsaturated double bond content is preferably no greater than 50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is a carboxylic acid compound, and it is preferably no greater than 50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (1) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is an alcohol compound.  When both are used, their total is preferably no greater than 50 parts by mol.  If the unsaturated double bond content of the polyester resin (1) is no greater than 50 parts by mol, production of a crosslinked component that dissolves in THF will be.facilitated.  The content is more<br><br>
preferably no greater than 45 parts by mol, even more preferably no greater than 40 parts by mol, particularly preferably no greater than 35 parts by mol and most preferably no greater than 30 parts by mol. [0134]<br>
For method (b-2),    low-molecular-weight polyester resin may be crosslinked by the method described above, and the crosslinking reaction method is the same as in method (b-1).  Since a polyester resin crosslinked by method (b-2) will have a low molecular weight, it will dissolve more readily in THF than a polyester resin crosslinked by method (b-l).  When a low-molecular-weight polyester resin is crosslinked by radical reaction, the low-molecular-weight polyester resin preferably contains an unsaturated double bond.  For crosslinking reaction of polyester resin (2), for example, it is preferred for polyester resin (2) to contain an unsaturated double bond.  The unsaturated bond content of polyester resin (2) is preferably no greater than 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (2) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is a carboxylic acid compound, and it is preferably 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (2) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is an alcohol compound.  When both are used, their total is preferably 1-50 parts by mol.  The lower limit for the unsaturated double bond content in polyester resin (2) is more preferably 3 parts by mol and most preferably 5 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is more preferably 40 parts by mol, even more preferably 35 parts by mol and m,ost preferably 25 parts by mol, [0135]<br>
Method (b-3) is similar to method (b-l) and method (b-2).<br>
As explained above, a THF-soluble fraction with a Mw/Mn ratio of 6 or greater can be produced by a method<br><br>
preferably no greater than 4 5 parts by mol, even more preferably no greater than 40 parts by mol, particularly preferably no greater than 35 parts by mol and most preferably no greater than 30 parts by mol. [0134]<br>
For method (b-2)f a low-molecular-weight polyester resin may be crosslinked by the method described above, and the crosslinking reaction method is the same as in method (b-l),  Since a polyester resin crosslinked by method (b-2) will have a low molecular weight, it will dissolve more readily in THF than a polyester resin crosslinked by method (b-l).  When a low-molecular-weight polyester resin is crosslinked by radical reaction, the low--molecular-weight polyester resin preferably contains an unsaturated double bond.  For crosslinking reaction of polyester resin (2), for example, it is preferred for polyester resin (2) to contain an unsaturated double bond.  The unsaturated bond content of polyester resin (2) is preferably no greater than 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (2) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is a carboxylic acid compound, and it is preferably 1-50 parts by mol to 100 parts by mol of acid components in polyester resin (2) if the constituent component with an unsaturated double bond is an alcohol compound.  When both are used, their total is preferably 1-50 parts by mol.  The lower limit for the unsaturated double bond content in polyester resin (2} is more preferably 3 parts by mol and most preferably 5 parts by mol.  The upper limit for the content is more preferably 40 parts by mol, even more preferably 35 parts by mol and most preferably 25 parts by mol. [0135]<br>
Me-chod (b-3) is similar to method (b-l) and method (b-2),<br>
As explained above, a THF-soluble fraction with a Mw/Mn ratio of 6 or greater can be produced by a method<br><br>
such as method (a), method (b-2), method {b-2) or (b-3) . For methods (b-l)-(b-3), the Mw/Mn of the THF-soluble fraction can be controlled by controlling the reactivity in the crosslinking reaction. The Mw/Mn ratio of the THF-soluble fraction can be increased by lowering the crosslinking reactivity of the polyester resin (1) for crosslinking reaction of high-molecular-weight polyester resin (1), or by increasing the crosslinking reactivity of polyester resin (2) for crosslinking of polyester resin (2). [0136]<br>
Methods for limiting the acid value and hydroxyl value sum of the THF-insoluble fraction to no greater than 40 mgKOH/g and for obtaining a Mw/Mn of 6 or greater for the THF-soluble fraction were explained above, but a particularly preferred method for producing a polyester resin for toner that satisfies both of these conditions is a method of crosslinking a polyester resin for toner comprising polyester resin for toner (1) with a peak molecular weight of 12,000 or greater in gel permeation chromatography and containing an unsaturated double bond/ and polyester resin for toner (2) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000 in gel permeation chromatography,<br>
In  order to ensure that the Mw/Mn ratio of the THE-soluble fraction is at least 6, preferably not only the high-molecular-wsight polyester resin (1) but also the low-molecular-weight polyester resin (2) participates in the crosslinking reaction.  Also, in order to produce a THF-insoluble fraction with an acid value and hydroxyl value sum of no greater than 40 mgKOH/g, preferably the high-molecular-weight polyester resin (1) is preferentially crosslinked over the low-molecular-weight polyester resin (2). [0137]<br>
The contents of the structural units and unsaturated double bonds in polyester resin (1) and polyester resin<br><br>
(2) may be controlled so that both polyester resin (1) and polyester resin (2) participate in the crosslinking reaction, with preferential crosslinking of polyester resin (1),  For example, polyester resin (1) preferably contains a structural unit derived from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol as a constituent component, and the unsaturated double bond content is preferably no greater than 50 parts by mol with respect to 100 parts by mol of the acid components in the polyester resin (1).  Also, polyester resin (2) preferably contains an unsaturated double bond, in which case the unsaturated double bond content of polyester resin (2) is preferably no greater than the unsaturated double bond in polyester resin (1). [0138]<br>

[0155]<br>
A production process for a toner of the invention will now be explained.<br>
The toner of the invention may be produced by mixing the polyester resin for toner, release agent and coloring agent, with additives such as charge controllers, flow modifiers, magnetic materials or the like as desired, and then melt kneading the mixture with a twin-screw extruder, followed by coarse grinding, fine grinding, classifying and if necessary external addition of a flow modifier.

The present invention will now be described in greater detail by examples, with the understanding that the invention is not limited to these concrete modes. The methods for evaluating the resins and toners used in the examples were as follows, [0158]<br>
(1) Resin evaluation methods 1} Softening temperature<br>
A CFT-500 flow tester (product of Shimadzu Corp,)<br>
was used for measurement with a 1 mmΦ) x 10 mm nozzle using a force of 294N (30 Kgf) , a preheating time of 5 minutes and a temperature-elevating rate of 3°C/min, and the<br><br>
softening temperature was recorded as the temperature at<br>
which 1/2 of a 1.0 g sample exhibited flow.<br>
[0159]<br>
2)	Acid value<br>
After weighing out approximately 0.2 g of sample in a  side-arm Erlenmeyer flask (A (g)) ,   10 ml of benzyl alcohol was added and the mixture was heated for 15<br>
minutes with a heater at 230°C under a nitrogen atmosphere to dissolve the resin.  After cooling to room temperature, 10 ml of benzyl alcohol, 20 ml of chloroform and a suitable amount of phenolphthalein was added and titration was performed with a 0.02N KOH solution. (Titer = B (ml), KOH solution strength = f).  Blank measurement was carried out in the same manner (titer = C (ml)), and calculation was performed according to the following formula.<br>
Acid value (mgKOH/g) , {(B-C) x 0,02 x'56.11 x f}/A [0160]<br>
3)	Glass transition temperature<br>
Using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-60 (product of Shimadzu Corp.)), a 10 mg sample was weighed out and placed in an aluminum pan, with an aluminum pan containing alumina as reference, and measurement was<br>
performed at a temperature-elevating rate of 5°C/min, after which the temperature at the intersection between the chart baseline and the tangent to the endothermic curve near the glass transition temperature was recorded as the glass transition temperature. [0161]<br>
4)	Peak molecular weight (Mp), mass-average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn)<br>
The peak molecular weight (Mp) was determined from the retention time corresponding to the peak value of the obtained elution curve in GPC, based on standard polystyrene.  The peak value of the elution curve is the point where the elution curve is at maximum, and where<br><br>
two maximum points exist it is the maximum value of the elution curve.  The signal strength of the GPC curve at peak molecular weight (I(Mp)) and the signal strength of the GPC curve at molecular weight 100,000 (1(MlOO,000)) are,, respectively, the difference between the baseline signal strength and the 3ignal strength at peak molecular. weight and the difference between baseline signal strength and the signal strength at molecular weight lOO.OOO, and they are represented as potentials (mV).

Approximately 2 g of Celite 545 (Kishida Chemical Co, Ltd.) was placed in a cylindrical glass filter with<br><br>
an inner diameter of 3,5 cm (IGPlOO, product of Sibata Scientific Technology, Ltd.), and the glass filter was lightly tapped with a cork board until the height of the Celite 545 layer no longer changed.  This procedure was repeated 4 times, and the Celite 545 was packed into the glass filter to a Celite 545 layer height of 2 cm from the filter surface.  The glass filter packed with the Celite 545 was dried at 105°C for 3 hours or longer and the weight was measured (Yg).  Next, approximately 0,5 g of sample was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and weighed (Xg), after which 50 ml of THF was added and the mixture<br>
was heated for 3 hours in a water bath at 70°C  for dissolution of the sample while circulating THF.  The solution was poured into the glass filter packed with the Celite 545 for suction filtration.  The glass filter that<br>
had captured the THF-insoluble fraction was dried at 80°0 for 3 hours or longer and weighed (Zg), and then the THF-insoluble fraction was calculated by the following formula,<br>
THF-insoluble fraction = (Z-Y)/X x 100 (mass%)<br>

the mixture at 95°C for 60 minutes and then cooling the solution, further adding 5 m.L of distilled water, and using phenolphthalein solution (0.1 mass%) as an indicator in titration with 0.2N aqueous NaOH (titer = B<br><br>
(ml) , KOH solution strength = f) .  Blank measurement was<br>
carried out in the same manner (titer = C (ml))/ and<br>

[0199]<br>
As seen by the results of Examples 1-24, the toners containing polyester resin (1) having a peak molecular weight of 12,000 or greater in GPC and containing unsaturated double bonds exhibited a satisfactory balance between low-temperature fixability and high-temperature offset resistance, and therefore had a wide fixing<br>
temperature range of 50°C or greater, while also exhibiting a practical level of storage stability and durability.<br>
[0200]<br>
Toner 2 (Comparative Example 1) had a peak molecular weight of 30,000, but since it comprised polyester resin<br>
(1'j) with no unsaturated double bonds, the minimum fixing temperature was satisfactory at 135°C but the maximum fixing temperature was 175°C, and therefore the<br>
fixing range was narrow at only 40°C.<br>
[0201]<br>
Toner 3 (Comparative Example 2) contained unsaturated double bonds, but since it comprised polyester resin (2i) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000, the minimum fixing temperature was satisfactory at 130°C but the maximum fixing temperature was unacceptable at 160°C while the fixing range was narrow at only 35°C.<br>
[0202]<br>
Toner 5 (Comparative Example 3) had a peak molecular weight of 30,000, but since it comprised polyester resin<br>
(1'j) with no unsaturated double bonds and polyester resin (2a) with a peak molecular weight of less than 12,000, the minimum fixing temperature was satisfactory at 130°C but the maximum fixing temperature was the minimum acceptable level of 170°C while the fixing range<br>
was narrow at only 40°C. [0203]<br><br>
Toner 28 (Comparative Example 4) had unsaturated double bonds, but since it comprised polyester resin (31-1) obtained by crosslinking polyester resin (21) with a peak: molecular weight of less than 12,000, the minimum<br>
fixing temperature was satisfactory at 135°C and the<br>
maximum fixing temperature was satisfactory at 180°C but<br>
the fixing range was unacceptably narrow at only 45°C. Also, since the Mw/Mn of the THF-soluble fraction was 3.2 and the sum of the acid value and hydroxyl value of the THF-insoluble fraction was 40 mgKOH/g, the durability was significantly impaired.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
