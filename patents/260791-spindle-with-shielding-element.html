				<td>SPINDLE WITH SHIELDING ELEMENT<br>
The invention relates to a spindle for winding up a thread in the form of a bobbin, to be arranged on a spindle rail of a spinning machine and having a shielding element, according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The term spinning in the sense of the invention is also to be understood as twisting where instead of the thread being wound up, the thread is delivered from a bobbin and the thread can be formed both of a yarn and also of a ply yarn.<br>
Shielding elements, such as are known from DE-OS-36 13 163 for example, are primarily used in fast-running spindles to reduce the considerable noise impact on the surroundings in some cases and also to reduce the energy consumption as a result of the air eddies formed around each bobbin, especially as a result of projecting hairs of the thread. As a result of the respective air eddies combining and being transported further from one spindle to another, an air flow is formed in the longitudinal direction on both sides of the spinning machine which can also have the consequence that free fibre ends are splayed apart on the thread produced and consequently an undesirable hairy thread is produced which further increases the air resistance of the respective bobbins. A large part of the driving energy of the spindles is inappropriately bound in this way. Particularly in the case of larger bobbin diameters, both as a result of the higher peripheral speed and also because of the increasing centrifugal force acting on the thread, these negative effects have a disadvantageous effect on the overall energy balance of the method, the burden on the staff and the thread quality. In the shielding element described in DE-OS-36 13 163 for a bobbin embodied as a cop on a spindle of a textile machine which works with ring travellers running on a running ring, the part of the cop on which a larger number of yarn layers is wound one above the other and which especially has reached a pre-determined diameter is surrounded whereas the upper part of the cop on which an increasingly smaller quantity of yarn is wound in the form of a conical lap is kept free from the shielding element so as to provide a certain accessibility when starting spinning, doffing or in the event of a thread break. On the other hand, the lower part of the cop on which the thicker part of the yarn package already formed, is formed is continuously surrounded by the shielding element. The shielding is constructed in the form of a bellows or a telescopic tube underneath the running ring and above the drive belt of the spindles and can be moved up and down together with the running ring. If a cylindrical tube having a fixedly predefined height which cannot be shortened is used as shielding, at least one slit must be provided at its lower edge through which the drive belt can pass which drives the wharve arranged on the spindle above the spindle bearing and surrounded by the shielding when the shielding is lowered. Since both the bellows and the telescopic tube and also the slitted cylindrical tube do not have a smooth, uniform and closed inner surface, and there is no constant distance between the outer surface of the cop and the inner surface of the shielding, an optimum state in terms of flow technology and therefore energy cannot be achieved.<br>
DE 34 00 327 describes a shielding provided for a bell spinning device which jointly surrounds the electric motor and the spindle constructed as its traveller shaft, where the inside diameter of the shielding is selected to be sufficiently large that the spindle- electric motor can move up and down inside the same. As a result of the large diameter of the shielding thus required, the distance between the bobbin and the shielding is so large that the efficiency at the spindle drive can only be improved to a very limited extent by the shielding. The shielding itself, which is either coupled to a bell shielding or to the spindle rail, can necessarily be opened for working on the bobbin such as repairing a thread break or for replacing full depositing tubes by empty depositing tubes, where the shielding can especially be constructed as hinged. Thus, free accessibility to the bobbin and the spindle or to the entire spinning position is only provided to a certain extent.<br>
EP 485 880 discloses a casing for a spinning device, especially a bell spinning device which consists of sleeve elements which can be pushed into one another. The casing is held on the bell support and surrounds this in the pushed-in position so that the spindle and therefore the bobbin are freely accessible. In the pushed-out state the bobbin is<br>
completely surrounded by the casing, with no constant distance between the outer surface of the bobbin and the inner surface of the casing as a result of the at least two telescopic elements of the casing so that no optimum flow-technology state can be achieved. Another disadvantage of the device described is the necessary complexity of the structure because of the telescopic property and the problematical liability to breakdown especially as a result of contamination by textile fibres.<br>
It is thus the object of the invention to improve the shielding of a spindle for a spinning machine for winding up a thread such that easy accessibility to the spinning position is provided, especially for starting spinning, doffing or in the event of a thread break, and energy losses caused by flow resistances at the spindle are kept as low as possible.<br>
The object is solved by implementing the characterising features of the independent claims. Features which further develop the invention in an alternative or advantageous fashion can be deduced from the dependent claims.<br>
The invention can be applied in principle to any spinning or twisting machine where at least some of the fibres possess a true twist in the cross-section of the process product and the machine thus has a rotating shaft with an area provided for winding up a thread and on which overhead winding-on or from which overhead drawing offtakes place. Hereinafter, however only spinning machines and spinning processes are specified where winding takes place onto a shaft, especially a depositing tube arranged there. It is known to the person skilled in the art that such processes can fundamentally be carried out, for example, using ply yarns, wrap ply yarns, mock ply yarns, core yarn or ply yarn, fancy yarn or ply yarn and other process variants and depending on the process, can be implemented in the material flow direction described and also in the opposite direction which is why the winding up of the thread is also to be understood as a take-off of the thread within the scope of the invention.<br>
The spindle according to the invention is described in general subsequently in a state mounted on a spindle rail of a spinning machine.<br>
The spindle as a complete unit comprises a drivable shank on which a winding zone is provided for winding up of a thread. The winding of the thread on the winding zone preferably takes place in a known fashion by forming a bobbin which, for example, is embodied as a cop, either onto a winding up element on the shank, especially onto a depositing tube positioned thereon or directly onto the shank which is configured as removable in the latter case. It is furthermore possible for a plurality of threads to be wound to one bobbin or to two axiaily offset bobbins. The shank can consist of a single shaft or of a plurality of shafts especially inserted one inside the other or screwed together, which can be separated for doffing the bobbin. The shank is rotatably mounted, especially floating, in a bearing sleeve which is connected indirectly or directly rotationally fixedly to the spindle rail of the spinning machine. The spindle rail may be generally understood as a component of the spinning machine which is fixed or which can be moved up and down with respect to the base member of the spinning machine depending on the spinning method used and on which the spindle is arranged. Located on the opposite half of the shank to the winding zone in relation to the bearing sleeve is a drive element by which means the shank can be driven. The mounting between the drive element and the area provided for winding up of the thread is thus located. This drive element is embodied, for example, as a wharve which can be driven by a drive belt of the spinning machine or as a rotor of an electric motor. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the spindle has a single electric-motor drive for driving the shank, which in this case forms the drive element, which is connected rotationally fixedly to the shank and whose stator is in turn indirectly or directly connected rotationally fixedly to the bearing sleeve, wherein it is possible for the bearing sleeve and the stator to form a common assembly. In a further preferred embodiment, the entire shank is mounted exclusively via the bearing sleeve by means of two rows of bearings where the drive element especially embodied as a rotor is arranged outside the bearing arrangement close to the row of bearings on the drive side so that the drive element is overhung-mounted. This produces a short lever arm between rotor and bearing arrangement which has a positive effect on the alignment accuracy of the rotor in relation to the stator whereby a high efficiency with increasing lifetime of the drive can be achieved. If roller bearings are used for the mounting, the bearing sleeve for example forms the common bearing outer race, where grooves for receiving the roll bodies are formed on the shank and corresponding elements are provided for mounting the bearing. Alternatively, it is naturally possible among other things to use two conventional roller bearings whose outer races are connected to the bearing sleeve and whose inner races are connected to the shank. For reasons of stability the rows of bearings are preferably a large distance apart with the axial spacing of the two rows of bearings being substantially greater, especially at least a factor of three times greater, than the diameter of the shank mounted in the bearing rows. In one possible embodiment the single electric-motor drive has such a small diameter that it can be accommodated inside the shielding element which is described further below or even inside the bearing sleeve. The spindle is preferably affixed on the spindle rail by means of a flange which runs around the bearing sleeve, for example, and is formed close to the drive-side end of the bearing sleeve, or by means of the stator of the drive so that the spindle is affixed to the spindle rail underneath the bearing or if necessary underneath the drive. Thus, an elongated region formed especially by the bearing sleeve is located between the spindle rail fixing and the winding zone of the shank. In a further development of the invention, the bearing sleeve and if necessary also the drive are surrounded at a radial distance by a bearing receiving sleeve connected to the spindle rail, which is connected to the bearing sleeve in a decoupled fashion by means of radially and axially acting spacing damping members. The decoupling of the rotating elements, the bearing and, in the case of a single electric-motor drive, the stator from the spindle rail improves the vibration behaviour of the spindle which protects the bearing so that the bearing lifetime increases and even higher spindle speeds can be achieved.<br>
The spindle additionally has a shielding element which, in a shielding position, surrounds the shank substantially in the winding zone which is provided to winding up the thread. The taken-up thread forms a bobbin which, for example, is embodied as a cop. The shielding element has a substantially cylindrical shape and is constructed especially in one piece with a smooth closed inner cylindrical surface, for example, made of plastic. Tests have shown that losses caused by air resistance at the bobbin are at their lowest if the inside diameter of the shielding element, depending on the type of thread being taken up, is at least 4 mm and at most 60 mm larger than the predetermined outside diameter of a bobbin from the taken-up thread. Best results are achieved depending on the thread in the range of about 10 mm to 20 mm and a closed smooth outer surface of the inner region of the shielding element. It is possible to match the internal contour of the shielding element to the predetermined external contour of a ready-wound bobbin at least in a part section. In one possible embodiment, the length of the shielding element is such that the entire maximum diameter zone of the bobbin can be shielded.<br>
According to the invention, the shank, the bearing sleeve and if necessary, the drive and any bearing receiving sleeve, extend longitudinally especially above the fixing on the spindle rail and are constructed such that the shielding element can be displaced axiaily along the shank over at least a partial section of the bearing sleeve, any bearing receiving sleeve and if necessary, the drive and the drive element. For this purpose, the length of the shielding element is preferably such that it can be displaced axiaily at least over the length of the maximum diameter zone along the axis of the bobbin. By displacing the shielding element at least over the shank and the bearing sleeve towards the drive, it is especially possible to bring the shielding element into an access position where the bobbin is substantially exposed over the length of the entire filling stroke of the spindle which allows unhindered manipulation at the spinning position, especially for starting spinning, doffing, or in the event of a thread break.<br>
In order to make possible this axial displacement of the shielding element, the shank and the bearing sleeve which surrounds the shank at least in a partial section and which supports the shank, have an elongated shape, especially above the fixing on the spindle rail which makes it possible to displace the shielding element towards the drive over the shank and the bearing sleeve where the outside diameter of the bearing sleeve in the overlapping region is smaller than the inside diameter of the shielding element. If the drive is also arranged inside the bearing sleeve and/or if the outside diameter of the<br>
drive is smaller than the inside diameter of the shielding element, in one possible embodiment the shielding element can also be displaced over the drive.<br>
The bearing which allows the shielding element to be displace axially is provided, for example, by mounting the shielding element so that it can slide axially displaceably on the outer surface of the bearing sleeve or the bearing receiving sleeve, if necessary using a sliding sleeve. In this case, means can be provided for holding the shielding element in a shielding position where the bobbin is shielded and an access position where the shielding element is displaced over the bearing sleeve. Depending on whether manipulations are provided at one or a plurality of spinning positions according to the method, means are provided for axial displacement of the shielding element or for synchronous axial displacement of a plurality of shielding elements of a plurality of spindles during the spinning process or for displacement of the shielding element from the shielding position into the access position and conversely. The shielding elements can also be movable in groups and individually independent of the group. For this purpose means are provided, for example, for individual decoupling of at least one shielding element, for example, in the form of a bayonet, screw or magnetic connection, from the means for common synchronous axial displacement so that the shielding element to be decoupled can be at least temporally excluded, especially manually, from the synchronous axial displacement of the remaining shielding elements.<br>
In a possible further development of the invention, the shielding element is not only axially displaceable but also rotatable about the axis of rotation of the shank. In this case, the shielding element is driven at a lower speed than the shank, for example, at half the speed. Alternatively, the shielding element does not have its own drive and is mounted in an easy-action fashion such that it is driven by the airflow flowing around the spindle. By means of these measures it is possible to further reduce energy losses at the spindle. The mounting is accomplished, for example, by means of air or magnetic bearings but other types of bearings can also be used.<br>
The spindle according to the invention is suitable for a wide range of spinning and twisting methods such as, for example, flyer, funnel, bell, loop, wrap and ring spinning and/or twisting both with and without balloon limitation or balloon-free, wherein the spindle according to the invention substantially only has differences in the actuation and dimensioning of the shielding element and the associated means for axial displacement of the shielding element.<br>
The device according to the invention is described in further detail hereinafter purely as examples with reference to specific exemplary embodiments shown schematically in the drawings, wherein further advantages of the invention are also discussed. In the figures in detail:<br>
Fig. 1a is a first embodiment of the spindle for a funnel spinning device with a shielding element mounted slidingly on a sliding sleeve of the bearing sleeve in the shielding position and a single electric-motor drive;<br>
Fig. 1b shows the first embodiment with the shielding element in the access position;<br>

Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the spindle for a funnel spinning device with a bearing receiving sleeve and a shielding element in the shielding position;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a fourth embodiment of the spindle for a ring spinning device with a shielding element mounted slidingly on a bearing receiving sleeve of the bearing sleeve in the shielding position; and Fig. 5 shows a fifth embodiment of the spindle with a single electric-motor drive arranged inside the bearing sleeve.<br>
Figures 1a and 1b show a first possible embodiment of the spindle 1a, where Fig. 1a shows a shielding element 10 in shielding position A and Fig. 1b shows the shielding element 10 in access position Z. Both figures are described jointly in the following. The spindle 1a comprises a long shank 4 on which a winding zone 9 is provided for winding up a thread in the form of a bobbin 8 embodied here as a cop, which is formed on a winding up tube 24 positioned on the shank 4. In the finished state, as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, the bobbin 8 has a maximum diameter zone 11 where the largest number of thread layers are located one on top of the other, having an outside diameter Dn and a length Ln. The shank 4 is mounted in a bearing sleeve 3 by means of two spaced roller bearings 18. As a result of the large axial spacing Lis of the bearing rows of the two roller bearings 18 in relation to the diameter D4 of the section of the shank 4 located in the bearing sleeve 3, more than three times, especially more than five times and in this case more that ten times greater and as a result of the favourable lever arm, the shank 4 can be driven substantially vibration-free at high speeds. For individually driving the shank 4, the spindle 1a has a single electric-motor drive 5 in the form of an electric motor whose rotor 6 is located directly on the shank 4 and whose stator 7 is arranged in a multi-section drive housing 25 connected to the bearing sleeve 3. The rotor 6 is thus overhung-mounted. Naturally, instead of the one-piece shank 4 which here has a driving, mounting and thread winding up function, it is also possible to have a plurality of interconnected shafts so that, for example, the drive 5 can be decoupled from the shank 4 especially for maintenance or repair purposes. Moulded on the drive housing 25 below the bearing sleeve 3 is a flange 19 for mounting the spindle 1a on a spindle rail 2 of a spinning machine by means of screws 20 so that the bearing sleeve 3 extends longitudinally above the spindle rail 2. A damping element 28 for damping the entire spindle is located between the flange 19 and the spindle rail 2. In the example shown, the bearing sleeve 3, the drive housing 25 and the moulded flange 19 are fixedly connected directly to one another. This entire unit is thus divided into three functional sections since it serves as the bearing housing of the shank 4, as the stator housing of the drive 5 and the fixing of the entire spindle 1a on the spindle rail 2. Alternatively, instead of a multi-part construction of this unit, it is thus also possible to use a one-part section which contains all three functional sections. In addition, the spindle rail 2 and the bearing sleeve 3 can be constructed in one piece. Thus, it should be noted that within the scope of this application a bearing sleeve is to be understood as a shaft casing which at least partly surrounds the shank 4 and mounts said shank especially by means of roller, sliding, air or magnetic bearings, which, as in the exemplary embodiment shown, can be formed by a single part or alternatively by a purely functional section of an element which for example also serves as a driving or fixing element. Instead of a direct rotationally fixed connection of the stator 7 to the bearing sleeve 3, it is alternatively possible, for example, to make the connection between stator 7 and bearing sleeve 3 via the spindle rail 2. In this case, in the unmounted state of the spindle 1a on the spindle rail 2 the stator 7 and bearing sleeve 3 are not connected. For shielding that part of the shank 4 located outside the bearing sleeve 3 and the drive housing 25, especially the winding zone 9 for winding up the thread, particularly for shielding the bobbin 8, the spindle has a shielding element 10 in the form of a cylindrical one-piece sleeve which is closed all around, whose inside diameter di0 is larger than the outside diameter Dn of the maximum diameter zone 11 of the bobbin 8 so that the shielding element 10 can be pushed over the bobbin 8 to shield the bobbin 8 from the surroundings. The axial displaceability is symbolised by the arrow 27. The inside diameter dio of the shielding element 10 is preferably at least 4 mm, especially about 10 to 20 mm, larger than the predetermined outside diameter Dn of the maximum diameter zone 11 of the bobbin 8. In addition, the outside diameter D3 of the bearing sleeve 3 is smaller than the inside diameter dio of the shielding element 10 so that the shielding element 10 can also be pushed over the bearing sleeve 3. The length L10 of the shielding element 10 should be at least as large as the length Ln of the maximum diameter zone 11 of the bobbin 8 so that the entire maximum diameter zone 11 itself can be shielded when the bobbin is almost completely wound. For optimal shielding however, the length L10 of the shielding element 10 is substantially greater than the length Ln of the maximum diameter zone 11, for example, at least as large as the length Lg of the winding up region 9 so that preferably the entire winding up region 9 for winding up the thread can be shielded in order to relieve the acoustic load on the surroundings on the one hand but on the other hand, primarily to make it possible to produce a bounded air flow field around the bobbin 8 inside the shielding element 10. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, the length L10 is such that almost the entire winding up region 9 can be shielded and in addition, the shielding element 10 is mounted on a sliding sleeve 21 surrounding the bearing sleeve 3 so that it can slide as far as the maximum shielding position. The sliding sleeve 21 is used to compensate for the difference in diameter between the outside diameter D3 of the bearing sleeve 3 and the inside diameter di0 of the shielding element 10 so that the shielding element 10 can be mounted so that it can slide in the axial direction, in the exemplary embodiment shown indirectly, on the outer surface 15 of the bearing sleeve 3. The sliding sleeve 21 is made of Teflon for example, If the shank 4, the bearing sleeve 3 and the shielding element 10 are suitably dimensioned and configured, the sliding sleeve 21 can be completely dispensed with. In the exemplary embodiment, the lengths Li0 and L3 of the shielding element 10 and the bearing sleeve 3 respectively are related such that a substantial portion of the shielding element 10 can be pushed over the bearing sleeve 3 so that, as shown in Fig. 1b, the bearing sleeve can be brought into an access position Z where the winding up region 9 intended for winding up the thread - the spinning position - is as freely accessible as possible so that manipulation can be carried out at the spinning position, especially for starting spinning, in the event of a thread break or for doffing. In the case shown, the length L3 of the bearing sleeve 3 is that length over which the section of the shank 4 encased by the bearing sleeve 3 extends longitudinally vertically above the fixing section of the spindle rail 2. For axial displacement of the shielding element 10, especially from the access position Z to the shielding position A, means 16 are associated with the shielding element 10 which, for example, are embodied as pneumatic cylinders. Since a plurality of spindles are always used in a spinning machine, it is appropriate to configure the respective shielding elements as synchronously adjustable and to accordingly synchronise the means 16 for adjustment. In order to allow manipulation at individual spindles, for example, in the event of a thread break if one group or all the spindles are synchronously closed by shielding elements 10, means 29 are provided for individually decoupling at least one shielding element 10 from the means 16 for joint synchronous axial displacement so that an individual shielding element 10 can be at least temporarily displaced, especially manually, independently of the remaining shielding elements. Thus, the connection to the means 16 provided for the synchronous movement can also be constructed as detachable, especially as manually detachable. Magnetic, bayonet, screw or other forms of closure can be used as these means 29 for decoupling. The shielding element 10 can then be brought manually into the access position Z. The spindle 4 in the first exemplary embodiment is part of a funnel spinning machine known from the prior art comprising a funnel 17 whose largest outside diameter D17 is smaller than the inside diameter d10 of the shielding element 10 so that the shielding element 10 can also be used for at least partial shielding of the rapidly rotating funnel 17, as shown in Fig. 1a. Since the funnel 17 and the shielding element 10 do not interfere, no axial displacement of the shielding element 10 is required during the spinning process. During loop spinning, a method where a thread loop projecting over the funnel wheel is formed underneath the funnel 17, the shielding element 10 is continuously adjusted however so that a constant distance exists in the axial direction between the lower edge of the funnel 17 and the upper edge of the shielding element 10 so that the loop can form unhindered. Alternatively, a recess for the loop is formed in the shielding element 10, for example.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of a spindle 1a' according to the invention with a shielding element 10 located in shielding position A and a belt drive. The second embodiment of the spindle 1a' is substantially the same as the first embodiment of the spindle 1 a apart from the drive which is why only the differences in the drive will be discussed in the following description. For the description of the remaining elements reference is herewith made to the description of the first exemplary embodiment of the spindle 1a from Figs. 1a and 1b. For driving the shank 4, instead of the single electric- motor drive 5 of the spindle 1a from Fig. 1a and 1b, a wharve 30 is affixed rotationally fixedly as a drive element at the lower end of the shank 4 underneath the fixing of the spindle 1a' on the spindle rail 2 by means of the flange 19. The wharve 30 and thus the shank 4 are driven by a drive belt 31 which in turn is driven by a drive which is not shown.<br>
Figure 3 shows a third embodiment of a spindle 1b according to the invention likewise arranged in the specific case on a funnel spinning machine, a further development of the first exemplary embodiment with the spindle 1a. The bearing sleeve 3 is arranged in a self-surrounding, radially-distant, especially cylindrical bearing receiving sleeve 12, where the bearing sleeve 3 and the bearing receiving sleeve 12 are connected by means of radially and axially acting, spacing damping members 13 decoupled from one another. A flange 19 for fixing the spindle 1b on the spindle rail 2 is formed on the bearing receiving sleeve 12. This arrangement makes it possible to decouple the entire unit comprising drive 5, bearing sleeve 3, shank 4 and bobbin 8 from the spindle rail 2 so that vibrations produced as a result of the high speeds of the shank 4 and formed during the spinning process are damped whereby extremely high spinning speeds can be achieved and the risk of build-up of the spindle is reduced. The damping members 13 consist, for example, of rubber-elastic material or rubber-metal elements, e.g. comprising a steel inner ring, an elastomer and a steel outer ring and are constructed such that the bearing sleeve 3 is mounted so that it is damped radially and axially downwards and/or upwards towards and/or away from the drive. The damping elements are preferably arranged at the height of the bearing rows or in their vicinity. In the third exemplary embodiment shown the outside diameter D12 of the bearing receiving sleeve 12 is smaller than the inside diameter di0 of the shielding element 10 so that, as in the first exemplary embodiment from Figs. 1a and 1b, the same can be pushed axially over the bearing receiving sleeve 12 and thus over the bearing sleeve 3 and the shank 4. In Fig. 3, however, the length L10 of the shielding element 10 is shorter than in the first exemplary embodiment from Figs. 1a and 1b and approximately corresponds to the length of the winding zone 9. In addition, the shielding element 10 is mounted via the means 16 for axial displacement. Alternatively, it would be possible to mount the shielding element 10 so that it can slide axially displaceably on the outer surface 14 of the bearing receiving sleeve 12.<br>
Figure 4 shows a spindle 1c similar to the embodiment of Fig. 3 which however is not mounted on a funnel spinning machine but on a ring spinning machine. Used as an element which guides the thread at least indirectly is a ring frame 23 movable in the axial direction with a ring 26 on which is located a traveller 22 through which the thread is guided and which can run around the bobbin 8. The shielding element 10 is fixedly or, if necessary, detachably coupled to the ring frame 23. The length L10 of the shielding element 10 is such that when coupled to the ring frame 23, it shields the bobbin 8 substantially over the entire length Ln of the maximum diameter zone 11, as shown in Fig. 4. As a result of the elongated configuration of the bearing receiving sleeve 12 arranged above the fixing on the spindle rail 2, the shielding element 10 can be pushed over the bearing which is the case, for example, at the beginning of the spinning process when the ring frame 26 is located in the lowermost position or if the shielding element 10 has been optionally separated from the ring frame 23. This optional detachable connection which allows the shielding element 10 to be displaced manually over the bearing receiving sleeve 12, especially for better accessibility to the bobbin 8, takes place, for example, by means of a bayonet, screw or magnetic connecting element.<br>
Figure 5 shows a fifth embodiment - a variant of the first embodiment from Figs. 1a and 1b - in the form of a spindle 1d with a drive 5 arranged inside the bearing sleeve 3. The bearing sleeve 3 is also used as a drive housing which accommodates the stator 7. Since the shielding element 10 shown in the access position Z in Fig. 5, which is mounted indirectly on the outer surface 15 of the bearing sleeve 3 by means of the sliding sleeve 21, thus can be displaced axiaily not only over the bearing sleeve 3 but also over the drive 5 located inside the bearing sleeve 3, the total length of the spindle 1d can be reduced whereby it is feasible to arrange the entire spindle 1d including the single electric-motor drive 5 and the bearing above the spindle rail 2. A damping element 28 is used for decoupling between the spindle 1d and the spindle rail 2. As a result of the shorter axial spacing of the roller bearings 18, the vibration behaviour in this fifth embodiment is somewhat less favourable than in the previous embodiments but the manufacture of the bearing is simpler. For a description of the remaining elements of Fig. 5, reference is made to the description of Figs. 1a and 1b.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
