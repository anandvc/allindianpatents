				<td>SEPARABLE BUMPER STRUCTURAL BODY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a separable bumper structural body  and more particularly to a separable bumper structural body which comprises a central bumper member and a pair of side bumper members which are separably integrally combined with each other. Description of the Related Art:<br>
There has been proposed a separable bumper which comprises a central bumper member and a pair of side bumper members for the purposes of increasing the damping capability of the bumper and easily and inexpensively repairing the bumper.  When the central bumper member and the side bumper members are joined to each other, steps are created at their junctions.  Such steps are poor in appearance and tend to collect dust and dirt particles. Furthermore, the steps are liable to increase in size as the bumper undergoes aging.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a general object of the present invention to provide a separable bumper structural body which has no steps visible in appearance, is simple in structure, and can easily be manufactured.<br>
A principal object of the present invention is to<br><br>
provide a separable bumper structural body which comprises a central bumper member and a pair of said bumper members with no steps existing therebetween in appearance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a separable bumper structural body which comprises a central bumper member and a pair of side bumper members with junctions therebetween that will not allow the bumper members to be staggered as the separable bumper structural body undergoes aging.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a separable bumper structural body which comprises a central bumper member and a pair of side bumper members that can be assembled and repaired with ease.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a separable bumper structural body comprising: a central bumper member having first plates disposed on respective opposite ends thereof, said first plates having respective ribs; and a pair of side bumper members having respective second plates disposed on ends thereof in confronting relation to said first plates, respectively; wherein the first plates and the second plates are joined to each other for thereby integrally combining said central bumper member and said side bumper members while making said central bumper member and said side bumper members lie substantially flush with each other at junctions thereof.<br>
The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example. With reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIGS. 1 through 3 show a fragmentary exploded perspective view of a separable bumper structural body 10 according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the separable bumper structural body 10 comprises a central bumper member 12 and a pair of<br><br>
side bumper members 13 (one shown).  The side bumper members 13 which are symmetrical in shape are detachably fixed to respective opposite ends of the central bumper member 12.<br>
A first plate 15 is integrally formed with and extends vertically across a longitudinal end of the central bumper member 12.  The first plate 15 has a plurality of elongate holes 20a through 20d defined therein at vertically spaced intervals for insertion of fastening bolts therein.  The first plate 15 has a rib 21 projecting perpendicularly to the plane of the first plate 15.  As shown in FIG. 2, the rib 21 extends along a substantially central line of the first plate 15 from the hole 20a to the hole 20d.  It can easily be seen from FIG. 2 that the holes 20a through 20d have portions extending into the rib 21.  The central bumper member 12 has a groove 24 defined in an outer surface thereof and extending along an outer profile thereof.  The central bumper member 12 also has another symmetrical set of a first plate 15, holes 20a through 20d, and a rib 21 on another longitudinal end thereof.<br>
The side bumper member 13 which is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, is of a cross-sectional shape which is substantially the same as the cross-sectional shape of the center bumper member 12.  The side bumper member 13 has a second plate 16 on an end thereof which is to mate with the corresponding end of the central bumper member 12, the<br><br>
second plate 16 having a plurality of circular holes 22a through 22d defined therein at vertically spaced intervals in alignment with the respective holes 20a through 20d in the first plate 15.  As shown in FIG. 2, the second plate 16 has an outer edge 16a whose profile is substantially the same as a profile 15a of the rib 21 on the first plate 15.  As shown in FIG. 3, the end of the side bumper member 13 has a flange 26 projecting for placement in the groove 24.  The other side bumper which is not shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 also has a second plate which is symmetrically identical in shape to the second plate 16.<br>
A process of joining the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13 will be described below.<br>
The outer edge 16a of the second plate 16 is placed in superimposed relation to the rib 21 of the central bumper member 12.  At this time, the flange 26 of the side bumper member 13 is placed in the groove 24 of the central bumper member 12.  Then, bolts 28 are inserted into the holes 20a through 20d in the first plate 15 and the holes 22a through 22d in the second plate 16, which are held in alignment with each other.  Thereafter, nuts 32 are threaded respectively over the bolts 28, thereby fastening the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13 to each other.  Such a fastening process will be described below particularly with respect to the holes 20c, 22c. The bolt 28 is inserted through the hole 20c, which is elongate for easy assembling operation, a washer 31, and a<br><br>
clip 30 into the hole 22c in the second plate 16. Then, the nut 32 is threaded over the bolt 28, fastening the bumper members 12, 13. At this time, the flange 26 of the side bumper member 13 is fitted in the groove 24 in the central bumper member 12. Therefore, no unwanted step is created at the junction between the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13 which are thus joined to each other. Accordingly, the outer surfaces of the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13 lie substantially flush with each other, giving a pleasing appearance to the joined bumper members 12, 13. Even when the central bumper member 12 or the side bumper member 13 is damaged, it can easily be repaired or replaced with a new one simply by removing the bolts 28 and the nuts 32. Because no step created at the junction between the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13, no dust or dirt particles are collected at the junction.<br>
FIGS. 4 through 6 show a separable bumper structural body according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Those parts shown in FIGS. 4 through 6 which are identical to those shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 are denoted by identical reference numerals and will not be described in detail below. The rib 21 of the first plate 15 has a plurality of vertically spaced rib wings 36a through 36e extending parallel to the plane of the first plate 15. As shown in FIG. 6, the rib wings 36a through 36e are spaced from the first plate 15 by a gap S which is large enough to receive the second plate 16 of the side bumper member 13. The rib wings 36a through 36e may be formed on the rib 21 if a mold for forming the central bumper member 12 has cavities and projections complementary to the rib wings 36a through 36e.<br>
Operation of the rib wings 36a through 36e will be described below with respect to the rib wing 36c, for example.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the second plate 16 is fitted in the space or gap between the first plate 15 and the rib wing 36c. At this time, the flange 26 of the side bumper member 13 is placed in the groove 24 of the central bumper member 12. Then, the bolts 28 are inserted into the holes 20a through 20d in the first plate 15 and the holes 22a through 22d in the second plate 16, which are held in alignment with each other. Thereafter, nuts 32 are threaded respectively over the bolts 28, thereby fastening the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper number 13 to each other. The rib wings 36a through 36e are effective to prevent the flange 26 from being displaced out of the groove 24 as the entire assembly undergoes aging.<br><br>
A separable bumper structural body according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8.  The separable bumper structural body according to the third embodiment is similar to the separable bumper structural body according to the second embodiment except that, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, holes 42a, 42b defined in the first plate 15 and the rib 21 are of a circular shape, and holes 42c, 42d defined in the first plate 15 and the rib 21 are of an elongate shape.  When the bolts 28 are inserted into the holes 42a through 42d, since the holes 42a, 42b are circular in shape, they allow the corresponding bolts 28 to be positioned accurately in place, and since the holes 42c, 42d are elongate in shape, they allow the corresponding bolts 28 to be adjusted in position.<br>
Specifically, the bolts 28 inserted in the circular holes 42a, 42b serve as a positioning reference for the joint between the bumper members 12, 13 when they are assembled together, and the other bolts 28 can easily be inserted into the elongate holes 42c, 42d.  Therefore, the bumper members 12, 13 can be assembled together highly efficiently.<br>
The holes for receiving the bolts and the rib wings in the above embodiments may be provided in any desired number.  While the first plate 15 has the rib 21, the central bumper member 12 has the groove 24, and the side<br><br>
bumper member 13 has the flange 26 in the illustrated embodiments, the central bumper 12 may have the flange 26, the second plate 16 may have the rib 21, and the side bumper member 13 may have the groove 24.  Alternatively, the central bumper member 12 may have the groove 24, the second plate 16 may have the rib 21, and the side bumper member 13 may have the flange 26.  Further alternatively, each of the central bumper member 12 and the side bumper member 13 may have the groove 24, the rib 21, and the flange 26.<br>
With the arrangement of the present invention, as described above, since the central bumper member and the side bumper member have the rib, the groove, and the flange which are combinable with each other, no step is created on the appearance of the assembled bumper structural body.  The assembled bumper structural body, therefore, is aesthetic in appearance, and does not collect dust and dirt particles which would otherwise be trapped in steps on the outer surface thereof.  The central bumper member and the side bumper member are separable from each other, they can easily be repaired or replaced when damaged.<br>
