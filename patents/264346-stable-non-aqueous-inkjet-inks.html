Description<br>
STABLE NON-AQUEOUS INKJET INKS Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to non-aqueous Inkjet inks improved for<br>
dispersion stability and suitable for manufacturing decorative laminates by single pass Inkjet printing.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are usually made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]   The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]  Polymeric dispersants generally contain in one part of the molecule<br>
so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed, and in a spatially separate part of the molecule, the polymeric dispersants have polymer chains compatible with the dispersion medium, thus stabilizing the pigment particles in the dispersion medium. Typical polymeric dispersants include graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0005]  In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment<br><br>
surface and hydrophilic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br>
[0006]  The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron<br>
particles is much more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable Inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]  These dispersing problems have lead to the design of very specific<br>
polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and achdone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
[0008]  Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substituted by one or more sulfonic acid groups or ammonium salts thereof.<br>
[0009]   US 4461647 (ICI) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-Insoluble asymmetric disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through azo groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]  Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is, for example, the case for diketopyrrolo-pyrrole<br><br>
pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous pigment dispersions, especially stable non-aqueous ink-jet Inks.<br>
[0011]    US 20040122130 (CHANG ET AL.) discloses a photo-curable pigment type Inkjet ink composition containing Pigment Red 254 but the ink requires the presence of water and a reactive surfactant.<br>
[0012]   No water is used in the radiation curable resin composition containing a solvent having a boiling point of 245°C or more at normal pressure of EP 1048700 A (SEIKO EPSON) but a certain minimal amount of binder resin is required to have a discharge stability of the color filter resin composition. For certain Inkjet applications the presence of monomers is not desirable because they render porous paper substrates transparent or translucent and also require the presence of radiation curing means rendering the Inkjet printer more complex.<br>
[0013]   The dispersion quality and stability can also be influenced by the solvent composition of the dispersion medium, however this also influences the behaviour of Inkjet droplets jetted upon the ink-receiver surface.<br>
[0014]   Many types of solvents and specific combinations of solvents have been disclosed. EP 1528086 A (SEIKO EPSON) discloses an oil-based Inkjet ink comprising at least 50% of a mixed solvent of a lactone-type solvent and a polyoxyethyleneglycol dialkyi ether. It was found by the present inventor that further improvements in dispersion stability and jetting characteristics, such as latency, were required particularly for single pass Inkjet printing. For certain Inkjet applications, it would also be desirable to make inks lacking a noxious solvent such as lactone.<br>
[0015]   For consistent image quality, Inkjet inks require high dispersion stability capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 65°C) during transport of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use. Theses changes in the dispersion medium can occur, for example, by evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives at the nozzles during the summer or when the printer is not jetting for a long time (= latency) and the Inkjet print-heads are filled with ink, e.g. over the weekend.<br><br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Technical problem<br>
[0016]   Inkjet printing provides large flexibility in the production of decorative laminates, but high printing speed Is required to obtain acceptable productivity. This is possible with single pass inkjet printing if the Inkjet printing process is so reliable that during a print job no maintenance is required. Inkjet inks having very high dispersion quality and stability and exhibiting minimal latency problems are therefore required. Aqueous inkjet inks generally exhibit latency problems due to the relative high volatility of water. Diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments have been a preferred choice in non-inkjet printing inks, such as e.g. gravure inks, to print images on a decorative paper used in the manufacturing process of decorative laminates for imitating a wooden floor. These pigments have been dispersed to acceptable dispersion quality and stability in aqueous inkjet inks but not in non-aqueous inkjet inks.<br>
[0017]   It is an object of the present invention to be able to manufacture inkjet inks exhibiting high dispersion quality and stability while exhibiting minimal latency problems.<br>
[0018]  Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
Technical solution<br>
[0019]   Surprisingly it has been found that a reliable non-aqueous single pass inkjet printing step could be integrated into the manufacturing process of decorative laminates capable of delivering decorative laminates with a warm wooden colour when non-aqueous pigmented inkjet inks comprising organic colour pigments and a specific polyalkyleneglycol dialkylether were used in the absence of water or radiation curable compounds.<br>
[0020]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous ink not curable by UV radiation comprising an organic colour pigment and between 12 to 98 wt% of tetraethylene glycol dimethylether based on the total weight of the inkjet ink.<br>
[0021]  Objects of the present invention have also been realized with a method for preparing a non-aqueous inkjet ink not curable by UV radiation comprising<br><br>
the steps or:<br>
a)	preparing a pigment dispersion by mixing a pigment and a solvent comprising tetraethylene glycol dimethylether; and<br>
b)	diluting the pigment dispersion of step a) with a non-aqueous solvent to obtain a pigment concentration between 0.1 and 20 wt% based upon the total weight of the Inkjet ink<br>
Advantageous effects<br>
[0022]  The non-aqueous Inkjet inks exhibited excellent latency so that no capping<br>
of the print heads was required. [0023]   It was found that not only the diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments could be<br>
dispersed to an excellent quality and stability, but also a wide range of<br>
other pigments could be dispersed in non-aqueous Inkjet inks exhibiting<br>
improved dispersion quality and stability. [0024]  The non-aqueous Inkjet inks did not require the presence of a surfactant<br>
for printing images of high quality on decorative base paper. Definitions [0025]  The term "colorant", as used in disclosing the present invention means<br>
dyes and pigments. [0026]  The term "dye", as used in disclosing the present invention means a<br>
colorant having a solubility of 10 mg/L or more in the medium in which it is<br>
applied and under the ambient conditions pertaining. [0027]  The tenn "pigment" is defined in DIN 55943, herein incorporated by<br>
reference, as a colouring agent that is practically insoluble in the<br>
application medium under the pertaining ambient conditions, hence having<br>
a solubility of less than 10 mg/L therein. [0028]  The term "C.I." is used in disclosing the present application as an<br>
abbreviation for Colour Index. [0029]  The term "alkyl" means all variants possible for each number of carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl group i.e. for three carbon atoms: n-propyl and<br>
isopropyl; for four carbon atoms: n-butyl, isobutyl and tertiary-butyl; for five<br>
carbon atoms: n-pentyl, 1,1-dimethyl-propyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl and 2-<br>
methyl-butyl etc. Non-aqueous Inkjet inks<br><br>
[0030] The non-aqueous inkjet ink according to the present invention comprises an organic colour pigment and tetraethylene glycol dimethyiether wherein the ink is not curable by radiation.<br>
[0031]  The dispersion medium used in the pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention is a non-aqueous liquid. However sometimes a small amount, generally less than 5 wt% of water based on the total weight of the dispersion medium, can be present. This water was not intentionally added but came into the formulation via other components as a contamination, such as for example polar organic solvents. Higher amounts than 10 wt% of water based on the total weight dispersion medium tend to make the non-aqueous inkjet inks instable, preferably the water content is less than 1 wt% based on the total weight dispersion medium and most preferably no water at all is present.<br>
[0032]  The non-aqueous pigmented inkjet ink according to the present invention contains preferably between 12 to 98 wt% of tetraethylene glycol dimethyiether based on the total weight of the inkjet ink. In a preferred embodiment, the non-aqueous pigmented inkjet ink contains at least 15 wt% and most preferably at least 25 wt% of tetraethylene glycol dimethyiether based on the total weight of the inkjet ink.<br>
[0033]  The tetraethylene glycol dimethyiether may also be present as part of a mixture of polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers. Preferred mixtures of polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers are polyethylene glycol dimethyl ethers having a molecular weight of at least 200, such as Polyglycol DME 200™ and Polyglycol DME 250™ from CLARIANT. The mixture of polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers has preferably an average molecular weight between 200 and 800, and more preferably no polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers with a molecular weight of more than 800 are present. The mixture of polyalkyleneglycol dialkylethers is a homogeneous liquid mixture at room temperature.<br>
[0034]  A non-aqueous inkjet ink is generally prepared in a two step process by<br>
first dispersing pigment and dispersant in one or more 'dispersion solvents' to obtain a concentrated pigment dispersion and then diluting the pigment dispersion with one or more 'ink solvents" and other components to obtain<br><br>
the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for a particular application.<br>
[0035]   In one embodiment the dispersion solvents may be other organic solvents than the tetraethylene glycol dimethylether but tetraethylene glycol dimethylether is then included as an ink solvent.<br>
[0036]   In the preferred embodiment the dispersion solvent(s) comprises<br>
tetraethylene glycol dimethylether and the one or more organic solvents used as ink solvents can be other organic solvents but may include tetraethylene glycol dimethylether.<br>
[0037]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present Invention may further contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0038]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0039]  The non-aqueous Inkjet Ink according to the present invention has<br>
preferably a viscosity of less than 100 mPa.s at 30°C. The viscosity of the pigmented Inkjet ink is preferably less than 30 mPa.s, more preferably less than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably between 2 and 10 mPa.s all measured at a shear rate of 100 s-"" and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0040]  For producing colour images, the non-aqueous Inkjet inks are used in a Inkjet ink set. Preferably the inkjet ink set comprises at least two non¬aqueous Inkjet inks according to present invention. In a preferred embodiment the Inkjet Ink set comprises at least a cyan ink, a magenta ink, a yellow ink and a black ink.<br>
Preparation of pigment dispersions<br>
[0041] The non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to the present invention may be prepared by milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0042]  Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and<br><br>
triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0043]  Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0044]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat.<br>
[0045]  The non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to the present invention may contain more than one pigment, the non-aqueous pigment dispersion may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0046]  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0047]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0048]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment, the selected mechanical means and residence conditions, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0049]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br><br>
[0050]   In general it is desirable to make the inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
[0051]   In preparing the inkjet ink, it is preferred that one or more degassing steps are performed at one time or another for removing air or gas bubbles from the ink. Degassing is preferably performed by heating and/or reduced pressure. The degassing step(s) can be performed on the concentrated pigment dispersion and/or on the final inkjet ink composition.<br>
Pigments<br>
[0052]  The organic colour pigments used in the non-aqueous inkjet Ink according to the present invention may be black, white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brovt/n, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
[0053]  The colour pigment may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769.<br>
[0054] Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Yellow 1, 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 55, 65, 73, 74, 75, 83, 93, 97, 109, 111, 120, 128, 138, 139, 150, 151, 154, 155, 180,185 and 213.<br>
[0055] Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Yellow 120, 151, 154, 175, 180, 181 and 194.<br>
[0056]  The most preferred yellow pigments are C.I. Pigment Yellow 120,139, 150 and 155.<br>
[0057]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Red 17, 22, 23, 41, 48:1, 48:2, 49:1, 49:2, 52:1, 57:1, 81:1, 81:3, 88, 112, 122, 144, 146, 149, 169,170, 175, 176, 184, 185, 188, 202, 206, 207, 210, 216, 221, 248, 251, 254, 255, 264, 270 and 272. For manufacturing decorative laminates, the most preferred are C.I. Pigment Red 254 and C.I. Pigment Red 266. For other non-aqueous inkjet applications the most preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Red 122 and C.I. Pigment Violet 19.<br><br>
[0058]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Violet 1, 2, 19, 23, 32, 37 and 39.<br>
[0059]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1, 15:2, 15:3, 15:4, 15:6, 16, 56, 61 and (bridged) aluminium phthalocyanine pigments.<br>
[0060]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Orange 5, 13, 16, 34, 40, 43, 59, 66, 67, 69, 71 and 73.<br>
[0061]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Green 7 and 36.<br>
[0062]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Brown 6 and 7.<br>
[0063]  Suitable pigments include mixed crystals of the above particular preferred pigments. A commercially available example is Cinquasia Magenta RT-355-D from Ciba Specialty Chemicals.<br>
[0064]   It is also possible to make mixtures of pigments in one pigment dispersion or non-aqueous InkJet ink. The Inkjet application may also require one or more spot colours, for example for packaging Inkjet printing or textile Inkjet printing. Silver and gold are often desired colours for Inkjet poster printing and point-of-sales displays.<br>
[0065]   Generally pigments are stabilized in the dispersion medium by dispersing agents, such as polymeric dispersants or surfactants. However, the surface of the pigments can be modified to obtain so-called "self-dispersible" or "self-dispersing" pigments, i.e. pigments that are dispersible in the dispersion medium without dispersants.<br>
[0066]   Pigment particles in non-aqueous Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0067]  The average particle size of the pigment in pigmented Inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 pm. Preferably, the average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 pm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 pm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 }jm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm. Larger pigment particle sizes may be used as long as the objectives of the present invention are achieved.<br>
[0068]  The pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion used for preparing the Inkjet ink in an amount of 10 to 40 wt%, preferably<br><br>
20 to 30 wt% based on the total weight of the pigment dispersion. In the Inkjet ink the pigment is preferably used in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink. Dispersants [0069]  The dispersant used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to<br>
the present invention is preferably a polymeric dispersant. [0070]  Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Copolymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the present invention may have the following polymer compositions:<br>
randomly polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymeri2:ed monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant;<br>
graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and<br>
mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0071]  Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the<br>
present invention may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 1-18.<br><br>
[0072]   Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). [0073]  Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. [0074]   Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process). [0075]   Polymeric dispersants suitable in pigment dispersions according to the present invention may be prepared via addition or condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include those described by ODIAN, George, Principles of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2004, p. 39-606. [0076]  Addition polymerization methods suitable for preparing polymeric dispersants for use in pigment dispersions according to the present invention include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include:<br>

MADIX: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using<br>
a transfer active xanthate;<br>
Catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes);<br>
Nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations; [0077]  Other suitable controlled polymerization methods include:<br>
GTP: group transfer polymerization;<br>
Living cationic (ring-opening) polymerizations;<br>
Anionic co-ordination insertion ring-opening polymerization; and<br>

[0078]   Reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT): controlled<br>
polymerization occurs via rapid chain transfer between growing polymer radicals and dormant polymer chains. A review article on RAFT synthesis of dispersants with different polymeric geometry is given in QUINN J.F. et al., Facile Synthesis of comb, star, and graft polymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry, Vol.40, 2956-2966, 2002.<br>

Living anionic ring-opening polymerization is e.g. used for the synthesis of polyethylene oxide macromonomers.<br>
[0082]  Free radical Polymerization (FRP) proceeds via a chain mechanism, which basically consists of four different types of reactions involving free radicals: (1) radical generation from non-radical species (initiation), (2) radical addition to a substituted alkene (propagation), (3) atom transfer and atom abstraction reactions (chain transfer and termination by<br><br>
disproportionation), and (4) radical-radical recombination reactions (termination by combination).<br>

PY150 is the abbreviation for Cil. Pigment Yellow 150 for which YELLOW PIGMENT E4GN-GT from BAYER AG was used. SOLSPERSE™ 39000 is a hyperdispersant from NOVEON. SOLSPERSE™ 5000 is a dispersion synergist from NOVEON. DEGDEE is diethyleneglycol diethylether from ACROS. TTEGDME is tetraethyleneglycol dimethylether from ALDRICH. PEGDME250 is a polyethyleneglycol dimethylether with an average molecular weight of 250 from CLARIANT sold under the tradename of Polyglycol DME 250.<br>
PEGDME500 is a polyethyleneglycol dimethylether with an average molecular weight of 500 from CLARIANT sold under the tradename of Polyglycol DME 500.<br>
Measurement methods<br>
1. Average particle size<br>
[0159]  The average particle size diameter was determined with a Brookhaven Instruments Particle Sizer BIQOplus based upon the principle of dynamic light scattering. The ink or dispersion was diluted with ethyl acetate to a<br><br>
pigment concentration of 0.002 wt%. The measurement settings of the BI90plus were: 5 runs at 23°C, angle of 90°, wavelength of 635 nm and graphics = correction function.<br>
2. Pigment dispersion stability<br>
[0160]  The pigment dispersion stability was determined by comparing the<br>
average particle size of the pigments in the dispersion or the ink with the average particle size of the pigments of the same ink subjected to a heat treatment of 7 days at 83°C in a sealed container. The %growth based on the original average particle size was used as a parameter to evaluate the pigment dispersion stability. The smaller the %growth value, the more stable the pigment dispersion was. The %growth value should preferably be less than 40%, more preferably less than 25% and most preferably less than 10%. For preventing the clogging of the nozzles, the average particle size should also stay below 200 nm, preferably below 150 nm.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0161]  This example illustrates that the presence of tetraethylene glycol<br>
dimethylether in the non-aqueous ink improves the pigment dispersion quality and stability in comparison to a polyethyleneglycol diethylether having only two ethyleneglycol units.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0162]  All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 1.<br>
[0163]  A milling mixture with 15 wt% pigment and 15 wt% dispersant was<br>
prepared by adding the pigment PY150 and the polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 39000 to the dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 % volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0164]  The inventive non-aqueous inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-3 and the comparative non-aqueous inkjet ink COMP-1 were then prepared according to Table 1 by adding 65 parts by weight of a solvent or solvent mixture (the "ink<br><br>
solvent") to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature.<br>
Table 1<br><br>

DEGDEE	65.0	—	—	—<br>
TTEGDME	—	65.0	47.5	65.0<br>
PEGDME 500	—	—	17.5	—<br>
[0165]   The commercial products PEGDME 250 and PEGDME 500 available from CLARIANT are a mixture of polyethyleneglycol dimethylethers.<br>
[0166]   The composition of the mixtures of polyethyleneglycol dimethylethers,<br>
PEGDME 250 and PEGDME 500, was analyzed by gas chromatography. The GC analysis was performed using an AGILENT Technologies™ type 6890 with a FID detector (flame ionisation detector). The liquid mixture was diluted with methylene chloride and 1 p\ of this dilution was injected. The column used was a J&amp;W DB1 column (capillary column type) having a 30 meter length, an inside diameter of 0.25 meter and a film thickness of 0.25 |jm. The stationary phase was polysiloxane polymer, the mobile phase was He gas, with a flow rate of 2 ml/minute. The temperature gradient was the following: start at 60°C, then raise the temperature by 15°C/min up to 320°C and keep for 15 minutes at 320°C.The analytical results for PEGDME250 and PEGDME500 are given in Table 2.<br>
[0167]   Polyethyleneglycol dimethylether can be represented by Formula (I)<br>
Image is not found at: "G;\CIP\Octarch\06\GS06\GSGN06033 -ECOSOLTETRAGLYME\PCT- EP2007- 053496\imgb0001.tif". Formula<br>
(I),<br>
wherein n represents an integer.<br><br><br><br>
[0170]   From Table 3, it can be seen that inventive inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-3 comprising TTEGDME (n=4) as dispersion solvent and/or ink solvent exhibited higher dispersion stability than the comparative non-aqueous inkjet ink COMP-1 having DEGDEE as dispersion and ink solvent. Moreover, the average particle size in the inventive inkjet inks INV-1 to INV-3 was smaller than in COMP-1, which is advantageous for preventing nozzle clogging and colour strength.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0171]  This example illustrates the minimum concentration of tetraethylene glycol dimethylether required in a non-aqueous inkjet ink for improving the pigment dispersion quality and stability. The non-aqueous inkjet ink contains a C.I. Pigment Blue 15 pigment and a dispersion synergist.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of ink-jet inks<br>
[0172]  All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 4 and Table 5, except that the concentration of the dispersion synergist and the type of solvent (the "dispersion solvent") in the milling mixture were altered. The concentration of the dispersion solvent in the milling mixture was compensated in function of the amount of dispersion synergist.<br>
[0173]  A milling mixture with 15 wt% pigment and 15 wt% dispersant was prepared by adding the pigment PB15:4, the polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 39000 and the dispersant synergist Solsperse™ 5000 to the dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 % volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time,of 45 minutes.<br>
[0174]  The comparative non-aqueous inkjet inks COMP-2 to COMP-5 and the inventive non-aqueous inkjet inks INV-4 and INV-5 were then prepared according to Table 4 and Table 5 respectively by adding 65 parts by weight of a solvent (the "ink solvent") to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature.<br>
