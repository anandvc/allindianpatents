				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to the field of wireless-communications networks. For example, the<br>
invention finds application in a network organised according to the UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System) standards. In particular, the invention is concerned<br>
with the receiver architecture of a participant in a wireless-communications network, such<br>
as a base station or a mobile telephone.<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a receiver chain for a UMTS mobile telephone 10.<br>
Radio frequency signals transmitted to the telephone 10 are received on antenna 12 and<br>
passed to demodulator 14. In the demodulator 14, spread-spectrum signals are extracted<br>
from their radio frequency carrier signals and are sent to a digital to analogue converter<br>
(DAC) 16. The digitised spread-spectrum signals are then sent to a rake receiver 18. The<br>
rake receiver identifies multi-path components within the spread-spectrum signals,<br>
despreads the multi-path components and combines them to produce an encoded signal at<br>
the chip rate consisting of a series of soft decisions. The encoded signal is then operated on<br>
by scaling unit 20 which applies a scaling factor to the soft decisions constituting the<br>
encoded signal. The scaled version of the encoded signal output by the scaling unit 20 is<br>
men passed to a codec 22 (an encoder-decoder). The codec 22 decodes the encoded signal<br>
using a process such as the Viterbi algorithm. The codec 22 outputs a symbol-rate message<br>
signal as a result of the decoding process. The message signal then undergoes further<br>
processing within the telephone 10, as indicated by processor block 24. For example, the<br>
message signal could indicate digitised speech which requires additional processing to<br>
convert it into an analogue signal which can be emitted from a loudspeaker (not shown)<br>
forming part of the telephone 10.<br>
As mentioned above, the scaling unit 20 scales the soft decisions that are produced by the<br>
rake receiver 18 for decoding in the codec 22. A certain degree of scaling is required to<br>
optimise the operation of the codec 22. The scaling unit 20 controls the degree of scaling<br>
that it applies to the soft decisions by monitoring its own output on feedback path 26. That<br>
is to say, the scaling unit 20 monitors the scaled soft decisions that it sends to the codec 22<br><br>
and uses the monitored soft decisions in an algorithm which determines how the degree of<br>
scaling should be adjusted.<br>
The details of the operation of the algorithm are not important and can vary from one<br>
implementation to another. However, the algorithm will produce an output in the form of<br>
an adjustment to be made to the scaling factor that is applied to the soft decisions and this<br>
output is derived by monitoring the power of the soft decisions arriving on the feedback<br>
path 26. A significant disadvantage of this approach will now be discussed.<br>
Figure 2 is a plot of a digital signal with amplitude and time represented on the vertical and<br>
horizontal axes, respectively. In Figure 2, the signal comprises a series of digital samples,<br>
issued at a rate of one sample per unit of time. The power, P, contained in the signal<br>
shown in Figure 2 is simply the sums of the squares of the amplitudes of the individual<br>
samples making up the signal, divided by the number of samples:<br><br>
Figure 3 shows what would happen if the signal of Figure 2 became saturated at an<br>
amplitude of 2. The power of the saturated signal can also be calculated:<br><br>
It will be seen that when the signal becomes saturated at an amplitude of two, the power<br>
value is drastically different to the power value that is obtained when the signal is not<br>
saturated. Therefore, in situations where the signal might become saturated, the value of<br>
the power of the signal might not be a good parameter to monitor.<br><br>
Sometimes, in the receiver chain shown in Figure 1, it is desirable to use a certain form of<br>
decoding algorithm within the codec 22, this algorithm being of a kind whose accuracy is<br>
increased if the signal that it operates on is partially saturated. Therefore, the situation can<br>
arise where the scaling unit 20 is intentionally inducing partial saturation of the soft<br>
decisions provided by the rake receiver 18. In this situation, a problem arises if the<br>
algorithm used to scale the soft decisions relies on the power of the soft decisions that are<br>
monitored on feedback path 26. That is to say, because the power value for any given<br>
signal monitored on feedback path 26 can vary tremendously depending upon the degree of<br>
scaling being applied to the signal, the power of the signal monitored on path 26 is not<br>
always a reliable parameter to use for controlling the algorithm which scales the soft<br>
decisions.<br>
One aim of the present invention is to ameliorate, at least in part, the disadvantage<br>
discussed above.<br>
According to one aspect the invention provides a method of conditioning signal values<br>
being conveyed to a'decoder in a wireless-communications network participant, the method<br>
comprising scaling the values, monitoring the probability distribution of the amplitudes of<br>
the scaled values and using the information gained through the monitoring step to<br>
determine if the degree of scaling should be adjusted.<br>
The invention also consists in a wireless-communications network participant, comprising<br>
a decoder for decoding a signal received at the participant, scaling means for scaling values<br>
of the signal being conveyed to the decoder, monitoring means for monitoring the<br>
probability distribution of the amplitudes of the scaled values and control means for using<br>
information supplied by the monitoring means to determine if the degree of scaling should<br>
be adjusted. Such a method can be implemented byas a computer program. Such programs<br>
can be accommodated by an appropriate data carrier, such as a read only memory.<br>
Thus, the invention provides an alternative scheme for scaling a stream of signal values<br>
which is Less effected by saturation.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the probability distribution of the scaled values is monitored by<br>
determining the fraction of a group of signal values that exceed a certain amplitude.<br>
The invention can be used, for example, in a participant of a 3G telecommunications<br>
network and the decoder is a bit-rate signal decoder using, for example, the Viterbi or max<br>
log-MAP algorithm.<br>
By way of example only, an embodiment of the present invention will now be described<br>
with reference to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a receiver chain in a UMTS mobile telephone;<br>
Figure 2 is a plot of a group of soft decisions representing a section of a signal;<br>
Figure 3 is a plot of the signal of Figure 2 in a partially saturated condition;<br>
Figure 4 is a plot of the amplitude of the soft decisions of Figure 3;<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the performance of a probability distribution measurement on the wave<br>
form of Figure 4; and<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the performance of a probability distribution measurement on a trace<br>
representing the amplitude of the signal shown in Figure 2.<br>
In the embodiment that will now be described, the power of the signal on path 26 is not the<br>
parameter which is used to control the algorithm which scales the soft decisions. Instead, a<br>
parameter based on the cumulative probability density function (CDF) of the signal is used.<br>
In fact, the parameter that is used to control the scaling algorithm is 1-CDF and is<br>
hereinafter termed the complementary CDF and is referred to as Q for ease of reference.<br>
The CDF for a given amplitude value of a digital signal is the ratio of the number of<br>
samples in the signal where the amplitude is equal to or less than the given value versus the<br><br>
total number of samples in the signal. The parameter Q is the ratio of the number of<br>
samples where the amplitude value exceeds the given value versus the total number of<br>
samples in the signal. That is to say, CDF + Q = 1.<br>
To illustrate the calculation of the parameter Q, we will use the example of the saturated<br>
signal of Figure 3. Figure 4 is a plot of the amplitude of the saturated signal of Figure 3<br>
versus time. In this example, we will calculate Q [1], which is to say the; ratio of the<br>
number of samples where the amplitude exceeds 1 versus the total number of samples.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates this calculation. As can be seen in Figure 5, the amplitude of the signal<br>
exceeds the value 1 on 7 occasions (as indicated by the vertical arrows) out of the 18<br>
amplitude points shown. Therefore, Q [1] = 0.389 for the signal shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 6 shows what the calculation of Figure 5 would have been like if the signal had not<br>
been saturated. Again, the amplitude of the signal exceeds the value 1 on 7 occasions (as<br>
indicated by the vertical arrows) out of the 18 sample points. Therefore, the result for Q [1]<br>
is unchanged by saturation in this example.<br>
Therefore, it follows that CDF, or CDF based measurements, can be used to make an<br>
assessment of the amplitude profile of a signal without being grossly effected by saturation.<br>
Of course, the degree of effect that saturation has on a CDF or Q value depends on the<br>
amplitude value at which saturation occurs relative to the amplitude at which the CDF or Q<br>
function is evaluated. For example, if the amplitude value of saturation is less than the<br>
amplitude value at which Q is evaluated, then the Q value will be significantly distorted by<br>
saturation. Therefore, it is important to keep the amplitude value at which the Q function is<br>
calculated to a level below the saturation limit.<br>
Returning to the embodiment, with the exception of scaling unit 20, the operation of the<br>
receiver chain is much the same as that described earlier with reference to Figure 1. In the<br>
embodiment, the scaling unit between the rake receiver and the codec evaluates the soft<br>
decisions on the feedback path by determining their Q function value at a selectable<br>
amplitude level.<br><br>
It is worth bearing in mind, as will be readily apparent to the skilled person, that the<br>
waveforms shown in Figures 2 to 6 are for the purposes of illustration only and that UMTS<br>
signals have a different appearance.<br><br>
