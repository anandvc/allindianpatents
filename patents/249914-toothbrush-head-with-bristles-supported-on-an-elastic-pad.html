				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to toothbrushes, in particular to toothbrushes having<br>
flexibly mounted bristles. <br>
Typically a toothbrush comprises a head and a grip handle disposed along a<br>
head - handle longitudinal direction, optionally with a neck longitudinally between<br>
the head and handle. Typically the head is elongate in line with this longitudinal<br>
direction, and has a tip end longitudinally remote from the handle, and a<br>
longitudinally opposite base end closest to the handle. Typically the head has a<br>
surface from which bristles extend, the "bristle face", in a bristle direction<br>
transverse to, typically generally perpendicular, to the longitudinal direction and an<br>
opposite back face. Typically the head has a width direction transverse to, typically<br>
generally, perpendicular to both the longitudinal and bristle directions.<br>
It is generally known to make the head flexible so that the head can respond<br>
to pressures applied to the bristles by resilient flexible deformation to cushion<br>
excess brushing pressures and to allow the bristles to accommodate themselves to<br>
the profiles of the teeth. For example DE-U-201 09 123 discloses a toothbrush head<br>
having bristles mounted in plural longitudinally arranged plastics material segments<br>
flexibly linked together, and mounted across the concavity of a supporting "bow".<br>
JP-A-13025411 discloses a toothbrush head with bristles mounted on a flexible plate<br>
across a concave backing and passing through holes in a guide plate.<br>
Various toothbrushes are known in which the bristles, usually in tufts, are<br>
mounted in a flexible bristle carrier. For example US-A-2,706,825 discloses a<br>
toothbrush with a concavely curved head the two longitudinally disposed ends of<br>
which support a demountable bristle carrier which bridges the curve and is made of<br>
elastic material. For example US-A-5,373,602 discloses a toothbrush in which the<br>
ends of the bristles are set in a rubbery flexible tip extension to the head.<br>
Various ways are known whereby the ends of toothbrush bristles may be<br>
fixed in an elastomer bristle carrier. For example WO-A-98/35584 discloses a<br>
toothbrush head in which the bristle ends are mounted in rigid wells set in an<br>
elastomer material. WO-A-98/43514 discloses a toothbrush head in which bristles in<br>
tufts are mounted in cup-like holders embedded in a soft elastic material. WO-A-<br>
00/60980 discloses a toothbrush head in which bristles in tufts have their ends<br>
linked by a web which is embedded in a soft elastic material. WO-A-05013762, the<br><br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses a toothbrush head<br>
which incorporates a mass of a gel material, preferably being a polyurethane gel,<br>
and bristle ends are embedded in the mass, also disclosing a toothbrush head having<br>
comprising a frame of a hard plastics material by which the mass is supported. A<br>
good bond is formed between such polyurethanes and the polyamide materials of<br>
which toothbrush bristles are generally made.<br>
WO-A-04/020238 discloses a toothbrush head in which bristles in tufts have<br>
their ends fused into a thickened mass and embedded in an elastomer bristle carrier,<br>
and are threaded through plastics material rings embedded in the elastomer pad.<br>
Such toothbrush heads in the state of the art are not optimised because the<br>
directions in which the flexibly mounted bristles in the head can flexibly move is<br>
limited, consequently the adaptation of the bristles to the shape of the teeth is also<br>
limited.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a toothbrush in which the bristles<br>
are flexibly mounted onto the head which overcomes at least in part the problems<br>
encountered with the above-mentioned toothbrushes of the state of the art, and also<br>
to provided alternative constructions of toothbrush head..<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from<br>
the following description.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a toothbrush head, connected to or connectable to a<br>
toothbrush grip handle to define a head-handle length direction and a width direction perpendicular to<br>
the longitudinal direction, comprising a flexible bristle carrier which comprises a pad of an elastic<br>
material on which bristles are mounted and having a base part closest to the toothbrush handle when<br>
connected and a longitudinally opposite tip part, and a support which supports the carrier;<br>
characterised in that the support supports the carrier at the base part and at the tip part leaving<br>
the carrier unsupported thereby in a region longitudinally between these parts, the carrier being flexible<br>
such that it can deform under the forces of toombrushing so that both its longitudinal and widthways<br>
sections become distorted, the support being capable of resilient bending deformation so that under the<br>
forces encountered in toothbrushing the tip part of the carrier moves resiliently to follow an arc in a<br>
plane perpendicular to the width direction, and performs resilient twisting deformation about a<br>
generally longitudinal twist axis.<br>
The bristles may be made of a conventional bristle material e.g. a polyamide<br>
material e.g. nylons such as Tynex™ (DuPont) abovementioned, or polyester. For<br>
example nylon monofilaments such as those commercially available from DuPont<br>
under the name DuPont Tynex, made from Nylon 512 may be used. Typically the<br>
bristles are grouped in tufts containing plural bristles, as conventionally.<br>
Typically bristles may be disposed in tufts containing conventional numbers<br>
of bristles and of generally conventional shapes and dimensions. For example tufts<br>
may contain 5-100, preferably 10-75, e.g. 30-60 bristles per tuft. Such tufts may for<br>
example be of circular or non-circular e.g. longitudinally or widthways elongated<br>
cross section, and may have a typical dimension across their length of 0.75 - 5mm.<br>
Circular sectioned tufts typically have a diameter ca. 0.9-1.5mm, and may have<br>
their ends proximate to the head embedded in the mass of elastomer material to a<br>
depth of 0.5 - 5 mm, typically ca. 0.7 - 1.5 mm, for example so that the proximate<br>
ends are disposed part way through the thickness of the mass from the bristle<br>
surface. Alternatively bristles may be embedded individually rather than plurally in<br>
tufts.<br>
In one embodiment the flexible bristle carrier may comprise a pad of an<br>
elastic material. This may be an elastomer material, preferably a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer material ("TPE"), as such materials can easily be injection moulded and<br>
bind with most of the plastics materials used for toothbrush construction. Many such<br>
TPE materials are known for use in toothbrushes. A preferred elastomer material<br>
has a hardness Shore A 10-40, preferably 20 +/- 10, more preferably 20 +/- 5.<br>
Some suitable materials are for example those available from Kraiburg Gummiwerk<br>
(DE) under the reference numbers RTF 8778, 8728, 8722 and 8725. The pad may<br>
have a thickness, i.e. its dimension in the bristle direction, of for example 2.5 to 5<br>
mm, typically 3 +/- 0.5mm.<br>
An alternative type of elastic material is a visco-elastic material for example<br>
a gel, suitably a polyurethane gel, for example the polyurethane gel materials<br>
disclosed in WO-A-05013762, for example those available under the name<br>
Technogel™ .<br>
The bristles, preferably grouped in tufts, may be mounted on such an<br>
elastomer material pad in various ways.<br>
In one way it may be possible to embed the ends of the bristles directly in<br>
the pad.<br>
In another way mounting of bristles into an elastomer material pad may be<br>
achieved by the use of plastics material, e.g. polypropylene, holders in which the<br><br>
tufts are retained e.g. as disclosed in above-mentioned WO-A-97/20484, WO-A-<br>
98/35584, WO-A-98/43514, which can bind firmly with the elastomer material and<br>
which can retain the bristles in the pad. Each of such holders may retain an<br>
individual tuft of bristles or may retain plural tufts of bristles, so that the holder<br>
comprises a connecting part between the tufts of bristles. The holders may be<br>
connected together only by the elastomer material between then, so that the holders<br>
are isolated islands in the elastomer material pad.<br>
In another way bristles in tufts may have their ends fused into a thickened<br>
mass and embedded in an elastomer bristle carrier, and pass, e.g. are threaded<br>
through plastics material rings embedded in the elastomer pad in the way disclosed<br>
in above-mentioned WO-A-04/020238 and for example as disclosed in applicant's<br>
pending European patent application EP 04010962.1 filed 7 May 2004, the contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such rings may be in the form of<br>
open-ended tubes which surround tufts of bristles which extend through them, and<br>
which are set in the elastomer material, and which allow movement of the tufts of<br>
bristles reciprocally along the bristle direction. The ends of the individual bristles of<br>
such tufts may be melted by heat so that they fuse together and then allowed to cool<br>
and solidify to form an enlarged mass, and this enlarged mass may be embedded in<br>
the elastomer material. Techniques to fuse the ends of toothbrush bristie tufts are<br>
known in the art.<br>
Another way of mounting tufts of bristles in such an elastomer material pad<br>
is, or is analogous to, the method disclosed in WO-A-00/60980. In this latter<br>
disclosure at least some of the bristles are linked together at their ends proximate to<br>
the head by a web which is incorporated into the pad of resilient elastomer material.<br>
In such a construction the ends of the bristles or tufts may be attached to the web.<br>
Such a web typically comprises a flexible substantially 2-dimensional structure<br>
linking the ends of the bristles or tufts. There may be a single web linking all of the<br>
tufts or bristles, or a plurality of separate webs each respectively linking<br>
independent groups of tufts of bristles. For example the web may comprise a thin,<br>
flexible sheet, lattice, network or mesh of a material to which the ends of the<br>
bristles are attached. Alternatively the web may be made integrally of the same<br>
material as the bristles.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the flexible bristle carrier may comprise plural<br><br>
plastics material segments which are flexibly linked so as to allow the carrier to be<br>
flexible such that it can deform under the forces of toothbrushing so that both its<br>
longitudinal and widthways sections become distorted. There may be two or more<br>
segments. To achieve deformation under the forces of toothbrushing so that its<br>
longitudinal section becomes distorted such segments may be sequentially<br>
longitudinally arranged. To achieve deformation under the forces of toothbrushing<br>
so that its widthways section becomes distorted such segments may be sequentially<br>
widthways arranged. Suitably such a carrier may comprise both segments segments<br>
sequentially longitudinally arranged and segments sequentially widthways arranged.<br>
The carrier may for example be divided both along and widthways across its<br>
longitudinal direction by flexible links, thereby allowing both its longitudinal and<br>
widthways sections to flex under these forces.<br>
Each flexible link between segments may comprise a flexible plastics<br>
material bridge which is thinner than the thickness of the segments it links, or may<br>
comprise a composite structure of a combination of a flexible plastics material<br>
bridge which is thinner than the thickness of the segments it links and an elastomer<br>
material, e.g. with the bridge surrounded on one or more side by the elastomer<br>
material, e.g. embedded in the elastomer material, or the flexible link may be<br>
composed wholly of an elastomer material between the segments it links. It is<br>
preferred that such links are constructed to allow the carrier to stretch in its<br>
longitudinal direction under longitudinal tension.<br>
In such a head comprising plural plastics material segments the bristles or<br>
tufts may be mounted into the segments in a manner as conventionally used in<br>
known toothbrushes with heads comprising plural flexibly linked segments.<br>
The carrier, e.g. the elastomer material pad or the segmented carrier<br>
typically has a bristle surface and an opposite surface, the "back face", distant from<br>
the bristle face in a thickness direction transverse to the longitudinal direction.<br>
There is an edge surface between the bristle surface and the back surface. Such a<br>
pad may have flat bristle and back faces and be of uniform thickness, alternatively<br>
one or both of the bristle and/or back surfaces may be profiled e.g. with widthways<br>
aligned ridges or grooves to concentrate flexibility in pre-determined directions.<br>
The support supports the carrier at a base part adjacent to the base end and at<br>
a tip part adjacent to the tip end, leaving the carrier unsupported thereby<br><br>
longitudinally in a region between these parts. Longitudinally between the base and<br>
tip parts the support may arch away from the back face of the carrier in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, in a curved or angular arched shape, e.g.<br>
so that the carrier extends in a chord direction between the cusps of the arch. In<br>
such a construction a space is left between the back face of the carrier and the<br>
support into which the carrier can deform. Typically the length of the unsupported<br>
region of the pad may comprise 50% or more, preferably 75% or more of the<br>
overall length between the extreme longitudinal ends of the pattern of bristles on the<br>
carrier. For example up to ca. 25% of the length of the pad immediately adjacent to<br>
the tip end and up to ca. 25 % of the length of the pad immediately adjacent to the<br>
base end may be supported by the support. In this construction the side surface of<br>
the carrier longitudinally between the supported parts of the carrier may be left<br>
unsupported. Typically the pattern of bristles on a toothbrush head has a length ca.<br>
20-30 mm. The space left between the back face of the carrier and the support may<br>
have a dimension 0.5-7 mm in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal<br>
direction, e.g. 4+/-1 mm.<br>
It is preferred that the support is flexible, e.g. capable of resilient bending<br>
deformation in its longitudinal direction, e.g. so that under the forces encountered in<br>
toothbrushing the tip part of the carrier can move resiliency to follow an arc in a<br>
plane perpendicular to the width direction, and/or capable of resilient twisting<br>
deformation about a generally longitudinal twist axis. The said plane perpendicular<br>
to the width direction may be a plane parallel to the longitudinal direction and to the<br>
direction in which the bristles extend from the bristle face. A flexible support<br>
having such modes of deformation assists the flexible deformation of the bristle<br>
carrier. Bending deformation of the support in its longitudinal direction can<br>
compress the carrier longitudinally to cause the bristle face of the carrier to shorten<br>
so that the bristles are closer together and denser packed, and can cause the bristle<br>
face of the carrier to adopt a longitudinally concave shape. Bending deformation of<br>
the support in its longitudinal direction can alternatively stretch the carrier<br>
longitudinally to lengthen the bristle face, or cause the bristle face of the carrier to<br>
adopt a longitudinally convex shape with splayed bristles. Twisting deformation of<br>
the support about a generally longitudinal twist axis can help the bristle face of the<br>
carrier to adapt more readily to the shape of the user's teeth and gaps between the<br><br>
teeth.<br>
A flexible support may be achieved by a support comprising longitudinally<br>
distanced support parts to respectively support the base part and tip part of the<br>
carrier, integrally longitudinally linked by one or more flexible plastics material<br>
link. The support parts may be adapted to support the carrier, e.g. may comprise a<br>
cavity in which the carrier may fit, and may be provided with engagement features<br>
to enhance bonding between the carrier and support. The one or more link may<br>
define an arched shape of the support, i.e. close to, suitably in contact with, the<br>
carrier at opposed longitudinal ends of the support, but relatively distanced from the<br>
back surface of the carrier in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction<br>
of the toothbrush, at a longitudinally intermediate position between these<br>
longitudinally opposite ends. Such a link may be in the form of a thin plastics<br>
material rib extending generally longitudinally. For example plural, suitably two,<br>
links may be disposed on widthways opposite sides of the central longitudinal axis<br>
of the head and may converge in the handle-to ward-head direction, e.g. being in a<br>
generally "V" shape pointing away from the handle, or a generally "Y" shape with<br>
the stem pointing away from the handle.<br>
However when the carrier comprises the above-mentioned visco-elastic<br>
material for example a gel, suitably a polyurethane gel, for example the<br>
polyurethane gel materials disclosed in WO-A-05013762, the support may be rigid,<br>
i.e. non flexible as described above.<br>
Therefore in a further aspect of this invention is provided a toothbrush head,<br>
connected to or connectable to a toothbrush grip handle, having bristles projecting<br>
therefrom in a bristle direction, each bristle having an end proximate to the head and<br>
an end distanced from the head, the head incorporating a mass of a gel material or a<br>
mass of a polyurethane material, preferably a polyurethane gel material, and at least<br>
a part of a bristle adjacent its end proximate to the head being embedded in the mass<br>
of gel material, comprising a frame of a hard plastics material by which the mass is<br>
supported, wherein the mass, preferably in the form of a pad having a bristle<br>
surface, is supported by the frame at a support point adjacent to the tip end and at a<br>
support point adjacent to the base end, but is unsupported longitudinally between<br>
these two longitudinally spaced support points.<br>
The support, i.e. the support parts, link(s) etc. may be made of a plastics<br><br>
material as commonly used in toothbrush manufacture, e.g. polypropylene ("PP"),<br>
polyamide ("PA"), acrylonitril butadiene styrene ("ABS") etc. and may be<br>
integrally made with the toothbrush handle. Support parts made of such materials<br>
may easily be made thin enough to be flexible as described.<br>
Other parts of the toothbrush for example the toothbrush handle may be of<br>
generally conventional construction. For example the handle may incorporate one or<br>
more "S" bends as disclosed in EP-A-0 336 641. Additionally or alternatively the<br>
toothbrush may incorporate flexible links at other places in its structure, for<br>
example between its head and the immediately adjacent part of its handle, i.e. its<br>
neck, e.g. as disclosed in WO-A-92/17092 or WO-A-97/24949.<br>
It is well known in the art of making toothbrushes how to connect a bristle<br>
carrier as described to a support made of the above-described plastics materials.<br>
For example the toothbrush head, and the entire toothbrush of this invention<br>
may be made by generally known two-component injection moulding processes in<br>
which firstly the plastics material part(s) of the toothbrush are made, then the so-<br>
formed plastics material part is enclosed in a second mould cavity and an elastomer<br>
material is injected into the mould cavity and caused to bond with the plastics<br>
material in a known manner. Bristles may be set in the carrier in a generally known<br>
process, e.g. as disclosed in above-mentioned WO-A-04/080238. For example a tuft<br>
of bristles may be provided threaded through a ring of a plastics material which<br>
binds to the elastomer material (which may be the same plastics material as other<br>
parts of the toothbrush) with the end of the tuft to be set in the head fused together<br>
to form an enlarged mass, this end may be introduced into a mould cavity and the<br>
elastomer material injected therein to bind the plastics material.<br>
For example above-mentioned WO-A-05013762 discloses methods by which<br>
a gel, e.g. polyurethane gel, may be connected to a support e.g. a frame.<br>
It is found that the elastomer materials e.g. thermoplastic elastomer<br>
materials, the described gel and polyurethane materials mentioned above,<br>
particularly polyurethane gels such as the Technogel ™ polyurethane gel materials<br>
bind well to the plastics materials commonly used for toothbrush manufacture, in<br>
particular PA and ABS.<br>
The support e.g. a frame and the bristle carrier e.g. the elastomer material<br>
pad or mass of gel or polyurethane material may be provided with respective<br><br>
engagement features to retain the carrier and support in secure physical engagement,<br>
and/or the carrier and support may be bonded e.g. by a weld, adhesive or adherence<br>
between the frame and the mass. For example the support may comprise parts which<br>
are embedded in the elastomer material pad or mass of gel e.g. polyurethane<br>
material to enhance attachment between the elastomer material pad or mass of gel<br>
e.g. polyurethane material and the support. The support, e.g. a frame may<br>
additionally or alternatively be provided with one or more aperture passing through<br>
the support from one surface of the support to another surface of the support,<br>
through which the material of the carrier, e.g. the mass of gel or polyurethane<br>
passes from the one surface to the other surface to form a mushroom head at the<br>
other surface to thereby engage with the support.<br>
The invention also provides a toothbrush, comprising a head as described<br>
herein, connected to a handle by which the toothbrush may be held during use. Such<br>
a tothbrush may be a manual tothbrush, or a power toothbrush e.g. in which the<br>
handle contains an electric power supply and an electric motor.<br>

the carrier 12 and from which the bristles 13 extend. The carrier 12 has a base part<br><br>
12-A closest to the toothbrush handle 11 and a longitudinally opposite tip part 12C.<br>
Bristle carrier 12 comprises a pad of a thermoplastic elastomer material<br>
("TPE") such as that available from Kraiburg Gummiwerk (DE) under the reference<br>
numbers RTF 8778, 8728, 8722 or 8725. The pad 12 has a thickness in the bristle<br>
direction B of ca. 3mm.<br>
Tufts 13 are mounted on the elastomer material pad 12 by the use of plastics<br>
material holders 15 in each of which the end of a tufts 13 is retained and which is<br>
set in the elastomer material of pad 12, binding therewith. The holders 15 are<br>
connected together only by the elastomer material between them, so that the holders<br>
15 are isolated islands set in the elastomer material pad 12.<br>
Alternatively the carrier 12 may comprise a pad, ca. 5mm thick, of the<br>
material Technogel™, i.e. a polyurethane gel covered with a polyurethane coating<br>
available from the company Technogel Konigsee, Gewerbegiet Alle Garnerei, 37339<br>
Berlingerode (DE), for example as the gel material BTG 120, in the form of<br>
polyurethane film coated sheets ca. 5mm thick. Such a pad, with bristle tufts set<br>
directly therein, i.e. without the holders 15 may be made using an IMC process as<br>
disclosed in WO-A-0513762. Advantageously as disclosed in WO-A-0513762 when<br>
such a polyurethane material is used, the bristle material bonds well to the<br>
polyurethane so holders 15 are not needed.<br>
The carrier 12 is supported at its base part 12A and at its tip part 12B by a<br>
support 16, leaving the carrier 12 unsupported thereby in a region 12C<br>
longitudinally between these parts 12A, 12B. Figs. 4 and 5 show the support 16<br>
with the carrier 12 absent for clarity. The length of the unsupported region 12C of<br>
the pad 12 comprises some 75% or more of the overall length between the extreme<br>
longitudinal ends of the pattern of bristles 13 on the carrier. It is seen that up to ca.<br>
25% of the length of the pad 12 immediately adjacent to the tip part 12B and up to<br>
ca. 25% of the length of the pad 12 immediately adjacent to the base part 12A are<br>
supported by the support 16. The support 16 comprises longitudinally distanced<br>
support parts 17, 18 to respectively support the base part 12A and tip part 12B of<br><br>
the carrier 12, integrally longitudinally linked by a flexible plastics material link 19<br>
(overall) in the form of thin plastics material ribs 19A, 19B, 19C extending<br>
generally longitudinally.<br>
The support 16 and handle 11 are integrally made of a plastics material (e.g.<br>
polypropylene ("PP"), polyamide ("PA"), acrylonitril butadiene styrene ("ABS")<br>
etc. as commonly used for the manufacture of toothbrushes.<br>
Longitudinally between the base and tip parts 12A, 12B the support 16, i.e.<br>
the link 19 of the support 16 arches away from the back face 110 of the carrier 12 in<br>
a direction opposite to the bristle direction B. This leaves a space 111 ca. 4+/- 1<br>
mm wide between the back face 110 of the carrier 12 and the link 19 part of the<br>
support 16 into which the carrier can deform under the influence of pressure on the<br>
bristles 13 during toothbrushing. This deformation of carrier 12 under the influence<br>
of pressure applied in the direction of the bold arrow is shown more clearly in Fig.<br>
6. The side surfaces 12C, 12D of the carrier 12 longitudinally between the<br>
supported parts 12A, 12B of the carrier 12 are left unsupported by the carrier, as is<br>
more clearly seen in the cross section Fig. 3. This lack of support allows the<br>
deformation of the carrier 12 as shown in Fig. 7 under the influence of pressure at<br>
the point indicated by the bold arrow, which may occur simultaneously with the<br>
deformation shown in Fig. 6 so that the bristle face 14 can deform 3-dimensionally<br>
to adjust the bristles 13 to the curved surface of the teeth.<br>
The support 16, in particular the link 19, is flexible, being capable of<br>
resilient bending deformation in its longitudinal direction, i.e. of bending about a<br>
bend axis parallel to the width direction W- -W so that the support part 18 can<br>
follow an arc lying in the plane of the paper of Fig. 6. In such deformation the<br>
frame 16 may bend into a more tightly curved arch shape to thereby compress the<br>
carrier 12, or flatten into a less tightly arched shape to stretch carrier 12. Fig. 6 also<br>
shows how downward pressure acting on the tip part 18 of the head as shown by the<br>
bold dashed arrow can cause the support 16 to bend relative to parts of the support<br>
16 closer to handle 11, about a bend axis parallel to the width direction W- -W, so<br>
that the tip part moves downwards in the direction of the light dashed arrow shown.<br>
Pressure in the opposite direction causes an opposite bending deformation. Fig. 8<br>
shows resilient twisting deformation of the link 19 about a twist axis generally<br>
aligned with the longitudinal direction L- -L, accompanied by a twisting<br><br>
deformation of carrier 12.<br>
The carrier 12 is bonded to the parts 17, 18 by bonding of known type<br>
between the plastic material of the support 16 and the thermoplastic material of the<br>
support 16. However support parts 17, 18 are also shown provided with engagement<br>
holes 112 which are wider at the outer surface of the support 16, so that the material<br>
of the pad 12 passes through these holes 112 to form a "mushroom head" at the<br>
outer surface so that the material of the pad 12 engages with the support 16. The<br>
support parts 17, 18 are also define cavities 113 in which the pad 16 sits, the sides<br>
of the cavities 113 providing an area for bonding between the elastomer material of<br>
the pad 16 and plastics material. The support parts 17,18 may be provided with<br>
additional or alternative structural features (not shown) to enhance engagement<br>
and/or bonding between the pad 16 and support parts 17, 18.<br>
Referring to Figs 9, 10 and 11, views analogous to Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are<br>
shown of a toothbrush head 20, Fig. 10 showing a longitudinal section cut along<br>
line A- -A, corresponding parts being numbered correspondingly. In this toothbrush<br>
however the flexible bristle carrier 21 comprises plural plastics material segments<br>
21A, 21B, 21C, 21D. The carrier 21 is divided both along and widthways across its<br>
longitudinal direction by flexible links 22 aligned across head 20, and links 23<br>
aligned longitudinally, and which comprise a filling of an elastomer material<br>
between the segments 21 A, 21B,21C, 21D, and which allow the carrier to be<br>
flexible such that it can deform under the forces of toothbrushing so that both its<br>
longitudinal and widthways sections become distorted. The pairs of segments 21 A,<br>
21D and 21B, 21C are longitudinally disposed, and the pairs of segments 21A, 21B<br>
and 21C, 21D are widthways disposed. Although in these drawings only two<br>
segments are shown longitudinally disposed there may be three or more. Although<br>
in these drawings only two segments are shown widthways disposed there may be<br>
three or more. The flexible links 22 may each comprise a thin, flexible link of<br>
plastics material integral with and connecting adjacent segments 21A, 21B, 21C,<br>
21D, and embedded in an elastomer material. Such links are otherwise known in<br>
toothbrush heads. Tufts of bristles 24 (only shown in segment 21A for clarity) are<br>
conventionally mounted. The support 16 comprises a link 19 which is flexible<br>
analogously to the link 19 of Figs. 1-8 and can bend and twist analogously to that<br>
link to allow deformation of the carrier 20. In Fig. 11 deformation of the widthways<br><br>
section of the carrier 21 and twisting of the flexible link 19 is shown.<br>
Referring to Figs. 12 and 13 an alternative form of toothbrush head 60 in<br>
views analogous to Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 12 the bristle carrier 64 is for clarity not<br>
fully shown, only the line of its edge being shown in dashed outline. Fig. 12 shows<br>
a plan view looking down toward the bristle face, and Fig. 13 shows a longitudinal<br>
sectioned view about the longitudinal line L - - L of Fig. 12 looking in the<br>
widthways direction W-W seen in Fig. 12. Figs. 12 and 13 show the toothbrush<br>
head 60, and part of the grip handle 61 immediately adjacent to the head 60. The<br>
head 60 and handle 61 are disposed along a head - handle longitudinal direction L-<br>
-L. The head 60 is elongate in line with this longitudinal direction, and has a tip end<br>
62 longitudinally remote from the handle 61, and a longitudinally opposite base end<br>
63 closest to the handle 61.<br>
A pad of thermoplastic elastomer material 64 comprises a pad having a<br>
surface 65, the "bristle face" and having an opposite surface 66, the "back surface",<br>
distant from the bristle face 65 in a direction, the "thickness direction", transverse<br>
to the longitudinal direction L- -L. There is an edge surface (not shown) between<br>
the bristle face 65 and the back surface 66. Surface 65 is generally in a plane<br>
parallel to the longitudinal direction L- -L of the head 60. Bristles 67 seen in Fig. 13<br>
extend from this bristle face 65 in a bristle direction perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal direction L- -L.<br>
The head 60 comprises a frame 68 integrally made with handle 61 of plastics<br>
material such as polypropylene. As seen in plan view in Fig. 12 the frame is<br>
approximately "V" shaped with two thin resiliency flexible links 69, 610<br>
symmetrically on widthways opposite sides of the longitudinal direction L- -L, the<br>
"V" pointing toward the tip end of the head. Frame 68 supports pad 64 at a support<br>
point 611 adjacent to the tip end 62 and at a support point 612 adjacent to the base<br>
end 63 of similar construction to those shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
A part 613 of each of the links 69,610 longitudinally between support points<br>
611, 612 arches away in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction L- -L<br>
from the back surface 66 of the pad 64 in a direction opposite to the bristle<br>
direction, to leave a void 614 between the back surface 66 and the part 611 of frame<br>
68. It is seen in Figs. 12 and 13 that ca. 25% of the length of the pad 64<br>
immediately adjacent to the tip end 62 and the base end 63 is supported by the frame<br><br>
68. As seen in Fig. 13 between these supported parts, i.e. adjacent the part 613, the<br>
pad 64 is unsupported.<br>
The links 69, 610 are resiliency flexible so that under the forces of<br>
toothbrushing the frame 68 can distort, e.g. so that the support part 69 can move in<br>
an arc lying in the plane of the paper of Fig. 13 e.g. as indicated by the arrow,<br>
and/or can twist about a twist axis parallel to the longitudinal direction L- -L. Figs.<br>
14 and 15 are cross sections through the head 60 of Figs. 12 and 13 and show<br>
resilient flexible deformation of the pad 64 under the forces encountered in<br>
toothbrushing. In Fig. 15 the resilient flexible deformation of the two links 69, 610<br>
as the part 614 twists about a twist axis generally parallel to the longitudinal<br>
direction L- -L is shown.<br>
Support points 611 and 612 comprise respective parts 615 and 616 which are<br>
embedded in the elastomer material pad 64 to enhance attachment of the pad 64 and<br>
frame 68, part 615 having apertures 617 through which the elastomer passes.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 an alternative way of setting the tufts of bristles 67 in<br>
the TPE pad 64 is shown. Cylindrical tubular rings 30 made of a plastics material<br>
e.g. the same material as handle 61 and support 68 have one end embedded in pad<br>
64, with their cylindrical axis perpendicular to surface 65, and an opposite end<br>
projecting from this surface. These rings 30 surround tufts of bristles 67 which<br>
extend through them and which have their ends fused to form an enlargement 31 and<br>
set in the elastomer material of pad 64. This construction allows movement of the<br>
tufts of bristles 67 reciprocally along the bristle direction, slidingly moving within<br>
the rings 30. Such a way of setting the bristles 67 is disclosed in applicant's pending<br>
European patent application EP 04010962.1 filed 7 May 2004. A process by which<br>
such rings 30 may made embedded in such a pad 64 is disclosed in WO-A-<br><br>
