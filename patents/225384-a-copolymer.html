				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to new polymerization processes including<br>
r<br>
diluents including hydrofluorocarbons and their use to produce novel polymers with new sequence distributions. In particular, the invention relates to copolymers of an isoolefin, preferably isobutylene, and an alkylstyrene, preferably methylstyrene, even more preferably para-methylstyrene, with new sequence distributions. The copolymer may optionally be halogenated.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Isoolefin polymers are prepared in carbocationic polymerization<br>
processes. Of special importance is butyl rubber which is a copolymer of isobutylene with a small amount of isoprene. Butyl rubber is made by low temperature cationic polymerization that generally requires that the isobutylene have a purity of &gt;99.5 wt% and the isoprene have a purity of &gt;98.0 wt% to prepare high molecular weight butyl rubber.<br>
[0004]	The    carbocationic    polymerization    of   isobutylene    and    its<br>
copolymerization with comonomers like isoprene is mechanistically complex. See, e.g., Organic Chemistry, SIXTH EDITION, Morrison and Boyd, Prentice-Hall, 1084-1085, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 1992, and K. Matyjaszewski, ed, Cationic Polymerizations, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1996.   The catalyst<br><br><br>
system is typically composed of two components: an initiator and a Lewis acid. Examples of Lewis acids include A1C13 and BF3. Examples of initiators include Br0nsted acids such as HC1, RCOOH (wherein R is an alkyl group), and H2O. During the polymerization process, in what is generally referred to as the initiation step, isobutylene reacts with the Lewis acid/initiator pair to produce a carbenium ion. Following, additional monomer units add to the formed carbenium ion in what is generally called the propagation step. These steps typically take place in a diluent or solvent. Temperature, diluent polarity, and counterions affect the chemistry of propagation. Of these, the diluent is typically considered important.<br>
[0005]	Industry  has  generally  accepted  widespread  use  of a  slurry<br>
polymerization process (to produce butyl rubber, polyisobutylene, etc.) in the diluent methyl chloride. Typically, the polymerization process extensively uses methyl chloride at low temperatures, generally lower than -90°C, as the diluent for the reaction mixture. Methyl chloride is employed for a variety of reasons, including that it dissolves the monomers and aluminum chloride catalyst but not the polymer product. Methyl chloride also has suitable freezing and boiling points to permit, respectively, low temperature polymerization and effective separation from the polymer and unreacted monomers. The slurry polymerization process in methyl chloride offers a number of additional advantages in that a polymer concentration of approximately 26% to 37% by volume in the reaction mixture can be achieved, as opposed to the concentration of only about 8% to 12% in solution polymerization. An acceptable relatively low viscosity of the polymerization mass is obtained enabling the heat of polymerization to be removed more effectively by surface heat exchange. Slurry polymerization processes in methyl chloride are used in the production of high molecular weight polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene butyl rubber polymers. Likewise polymerizations of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene are also conducted using methyl chloride. Similarly, star-branched butyl rubber is also produced using methyl chloride.<br><br>
[0006]	However, there are a number of problems associated with the<br>
polymerization in methyl chloride, for example, the tendency of the polymer particles in the reactor to agglomerate with each other and to collect on the reactor wall, heat transfer surfaces, impeller(s), and the agitator(s)/pump(s). The rate of agglomeration increases rapidly as reaction temperature rises. Agglomerated particles tend to adhere to and grow and plate-out on all surfaces they contact, such as reactor discharge lines, as well as any heat transfer equipment being used to remove the exothermic heat of polymerization, which is critical since low temperature reaction conditions must be maintained.<br>
[0007]	The commercial reactors typically used to make these rubbers are<br>
well mixed vessels of greater than 10 to 30 liters in volume with a high circulation rate provided by a pump impeller. The polymerization and the pump both generate heat and, in order to keep the slurry cold, the reaction system needs to have the ability to remove the heat. An example of such a continuous flow stirred tank reactor ("CFSTR") is found in U.S. Patent No. 5,417,930, incorporated by reference, hereinafter referred to in general as a "reactor" or "butyl reactor". In these reactors, slurry is circulated through tubes of a heat exchanger by a pump, while boiling ethylene on the shell side provides cooling, the slurry temperature being determined by the boiling ethylene temperature, the required heat flux and the overall resistance to heat transfer. On the slurry side, the heat exchanger surfaces progressively accumulate polymer, inhibiting heat transfer, which would tend to cause the slurry temperature to rise. This often limits the practical slurry concentration that can be used in most reactors from 26 to 37 volume % relative to the total volume of the slurry, diluent, and unreacted monomers. The subject of polymer accumulation has been addressed in several patents (such as U.S. Patent No. 2,534,698, U.S. Patent No. 2,548,415, U.S. Patent No. 2,644,809). However, these patents have unsatisfactorily addressed the myriad of problems associated with polymer particle agglomeration for implementing a desired commercial process.<br><br>
[0008]	U.S. Patent No. 2,534,698 discloses, inter alia, a polymerization<br>
process comprising the steps in combination of dispersing a mixture of isobutylene and a polyolefin having 4 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule, into a body of a fluorine substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon containing material without substantial solution therein, in the proportion of from one-half part to 10 parts of fluorine substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon having from one to five carbon atoms per molecule which is liquid at the polymerization temperature and polymerizing the dispersed mixture of isobutylene and polyolefin having four to fourteen carbon atoms per molecule at temperatures between -20°C and -164°C by the application thereto a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. However, '698 teaches that the suitable fluorocarbons would result in a biphasic system with the monomer, comonomer and catalyst being substantially insoluble in the fluorocarbon making their use difficult and unsatisfactory.<br>
[0009]	U.S. Patent No.  2,548,415  discloses,  inter alia, a continuous<br>
polymerization process for the preparation of a copolymer, the steps comprising continuously delivering to a polymerization reactors a stream consisting of a major proportion of isobutylene and a minor proportion isoprene; diluting the mixture with from 1/2 volume to 10 volumes of ethylidene difiuoride; copolymerizing the mixture of isobutylene isoprene by the continuous addition to the reaction mixture of a liquid stream of previously prepared polymerization catalyst consisting of boron trifluoride in solution in ethylidene difiuoride,<br>
maintaining the temperature between -40°C and -103°C throughout the entire copolymerization reaction .... '415 teaches the use of boron trifluoride and its complexes as the Lewis acid catalyst and 1,1-difluoroethane as a preferred combination. This combination provides a system in which the catalyst, monomer and comonomer are all soluble and yet still affords a high degree of polymer insolubility to capture the benefits of reduced reactor fouling. However, boron trifluoride is not a preferred commercial catalyst for butyl polymers for a variety of reasons.<br><br>
[0010]	U.S. Patent No. 2,644,809   teaches, inter alia, a polymerization<br>
process comprising the steps in combination of mixing together a major proportion of a monoolefm having 4 to 8, inclusive, carbon atoms per molecule, with a minor proportion of a multiolefin having from 4 to 14, inclusive, carbon atoms per molecule, and polymerizing the resulting mixture with a dissolved Friedel-Crafts catalyst, in the presence of from 1 to 10 volumes (computed upon the mixed olefins) of a liquid selected from the group consisting of dichlorodifluoromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromonofluormethane, dichloromonofluormethane, dichlorotetrafluorethane, and mixtures thereof, the monoolefm and multiolefin being dissolved in said liquid, and carrying out the polymerization at a temperature between -20oC and the freezing point of the liquid. '809 discloses the utility of chlorofluorocarbons at maintaining ideal slurry characteristics and minimizing reactor fouling, but teaches the incorporation of diolefin (i.e. isoprene) by the addition of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). CFC's are known to be ozone-depleting chemicals. Governmental regulations, however, tightly controls the manufacture and distribution of CFC's making these materials unattractive for commercial operation.<br>
[0011]	Additionally, Thaler, W. A., Buckley, Sr., D. J., High Molecular-<br>
Weight, High Unsaturation Copolymers of Isobutylene and Conjugated Dienes, 49(4) Rubber Chemical Technology, 960 (1976), discloses, inter alia, the cationic slurry polymerization of copolymers of isobutylene with isoprene (butyl rubber) and with cyclopentadiene in heptane.<br>
[0012]	Therefore, finding alternative diluents or blends of diluents to<br>
create new polymerization systems that would reduce particle agglomeration and/or reduce the amount of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methyl chloride is desirable. Such new polymerization systems would reduce particle agglomeration and reactor fouling without having to compromise process parameters, conditions, or components and/or without sacrificing productivity/throughput and/or the ability to produce high molecular weight polymers. Additionally, finding new polymers associated with the aforementioned processes would help supply the<br><br>
world's increasing demand for elastomers and/or also provide for new end use applications.<br>
[0013]	Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's) are chemicals that are currently used<br>
as environmentally friendly refrigerants because they have a very low (even zero) ozone depletion potential. Their low ozone depletion potential is thought to be related to the lack of chlorine. The HFC's also typically have low flammability particularly as compared to hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
[0014]	Isobutylene/p-methylstyrene     copolymerizations     have     been<br>
conducted under a variety of polymerization conditions including different monomer feed ratios, temperatures, catalysts, and solvents or diluents. A number of these systems have been described. See e.g. H.-C. Wang, K.W. Powers in Elastomerics 1992, January, 14; Z. Fodor, R. Faust in J. Macromol. Sci.-Pure Appl. Chem. 1994, A31, 1985; I. Orszagh, A. Nagy, J.P. Kennedy, J. Phys. Org. Chem. 1995,5,258.<br>
[0015]	The copolymerization of isobutylene and p-methylstyrene has been<br>
conducted in solution and in slurry. Solution polymerizations often employ chlorinated hydrocarbons or mixtures of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons to serve as a solvent for the monomers, catalyst and the prepared copolymers. A typical example is methyl chloride/hexane mixtures. In slurry copolymerization, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, usually methyl chloride, is used as a solvent for the monomers and catalyst, but the copolymer produced is insoluble in the diluent.<br>
[0016]	The sequence distribution, i.e. characterization of the arrangement<br>
of the monomer units along polymer chain, of the prepared copolymers is influenced by the polymerization conditions as well as the intrinsic reactivity of the comonomers employed. The sequence distribution of a copolymer may be expressed in terms of combinations of adjacent structural units. For example, characterizable sequences of two monomer units are called diads. Three monomer<br><br>
unit sequences are called triads. Four monomer unit sequences are called tetrads and so forth. Copolymers prepared under different conditions with the same comonomer incorporation may exhibit differences in their sequence distributions as expressed by the diad (or triad, etc.) fractions in the copolymer chain. Sequence distributions and comonomer incorporation are mathematically linked by probability statistics because of the competitive nature of the chemical events involved in copolymerization. A parameter that aids in the characterization of this relationship is the reactivity ratio, a ratio of the rate constants of homopropagation (adding a like monomer) to cross propagation (adding an unlike monomer). Copolymers with the same comonomer incorporation, but with different sequence distributions often exhibit different physical properties. See e.g. Chemical Microstructure of Polymer Chains, J.L. Koenig, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1980, and Polymer Sequence Determination: Carbon-13 NMR Method, J.C. Randall, Academic Press, 1977. An extreme, but clarifying example is the comparison of the physical attributes of random and block copolymers.<br>
[0017]	It is generally known that p-alkylstyrenes are more reactive than<br>
isobutylene in carbocationic copolymerization systems. Of the known linear p-alkylstyrenes, p-methylstyrene is the most widely used in copolymerization with isobutylene. The tendency towards higher reactivity of the p-alkylstyrene is expressed in the sequence distribution of the prepared copolymers. At a given copolymer composition, p-methylstyrene units exhibit a tendency to follow other p-methylstyrene units in the copolymer chain. Consequently, BSB (B = isobutylene, S = p-methylstyrene) triads are present at relatively lower concentrations than copolymerization systems in which the reactivity of the comonomers are more similar.<br>
[0018]	Because isobutylene/p-methylstyrene copolymerizations are often<br>
conducted in chlorinated hydrocarbons or mixtures of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons, the degree to which the sequence distribution can be varied is quite limited. Expression of this limitation is found by examination of the known reactivity ratios of p-methylstyrene for isobutylene/p-methylstyrene<br><br>
copolymerizations See e.g. H.-C. Wang, K.W. Powers in Elastomerics 1992, January, 14; Z. Fodor, R. Faust in J. Macromol. Sci.-Pure Appl. Chem. 1994, ,437, 1985; I. Orszagh, A. Nagy, J.P. Kennedy, J. Phys. Org. Chem. 1995, 8, 258. Finding a polymerization system in which p-alkylstyrene centered triad fractions can be prepared which are different than those available using known copolymerization conditions is desirable. Copolymers that possess higher concentrations of isoolefm-p-alkylstyrene-isoolefin triad fractions are useful for the preparation of materials that possess both crosslinking sites and functional groups.<br>

[0074]	In   one   embodiment,   this   invention   relates   to   the   use   of<br>
hydrofluorocarbon(s) or blends of hydrofluorocarbon(s) with hydrocarbon(s) and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon(s) to produce a polymer slurry which is less prone to fouling (i.e., also observed more glass like, less sticky particles in the reaction vessel with reduced adherence to the walls of the vessel or to the stirring impeller as well as reduced particle to particle agglomeration). More particularly, this invention relates to the use of hydrofluorocarbon diluent(s) or HFC diluent blends with hydrocarbons and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon blends to polymerize and copolymerize isoolefins with dienes and/or alkylstyrenes to produce isoolefin homopolymers and copolymers with significantly reduced reactor fouling. Further, this invention relates to the use of hydrofluorocarbon diluent(s) or diluent blends with hydrocarbons and/or chlorinated hydrocarbon blends to polymerize and copolymerize isoolefins with dienes to produce isoolefin copolymers with significantly reduced reactor fouling and hence longer run life for the reactors, as compared to conventional systems.<br>
[0075]	In another embodiment, the hydrofluorocarbons are used in a<br>
tubular reactor to obtain reduced polymer accumulation on the heat transfer tubes and/or reduce polymer accumulation on the impeller and thus obtain longer run life.<br>
[0076]	In another embodiment, the hydrofluorocarbons are used in a<br>
tubular reactor at higher temperatures to produce polymers at much greater run lengths (such as greater than 15 hours, preferably greater than 20 hours, preferably greater than 30 hours, more preferably greater than 48 hours than possible with other halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
[0077]	In another embodiment the hydrofluorocarbons are used in an<br>

diluent and monomers mixture to reduce reactor wall fouling, and agitator/impeller fouling among other things.<br>
[0078]	In another preferred embodiment the hydrofluorocarbons are used<br>
in a polymerization process to obtain higher molecular weights at the same temperature than when other halogenated hydrocarbons are used.<br>
[0079]	In one embodiment, this invention relates to the discovery of new<br>
polymerization systems using diluents containing hydrofluorocarbons. These diluents effectively dissolve the selected catalyst system and monomers but are relatively poor solvents for the polymer product. Polymerization systems using these diluents are less prone to fouling due to the agglomeration of polymer particles to each other and their depositing on polymerization hardware. In addition, this invention further relates to the use of these diluents in polymerization systems for the preparation of high molecular weight polymers and copolymers at equivalent to or higher than to those polymerization temperatures using solely chlorinated hydrocarbon diluents such as methyl chloride.<br>
[0080]	In another embodiment, this invention relates to the discovery of<br>
new polymerization systems using fluorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons capable of dissolving the catalyst system. These polymerization systems are also beneficial for isoolefin slurry polymerization and production of a polymer slurry that is less prone to fouling, while permitting dissolution of monomer, comonomer and the commercially preferred alkylaluminum halide catalysts. In addition, this invention further relates to the use of these diluents for the preparation of high molecular weight polymers and copolymers at higher polymerization temperatures as compared to polymerization systems using solely chlorinated hydrocarbon diluents such as methyl chloride.<br>
[0081]	In yet another embodiment, this invention relates to the preparation<br>
of isoolefmic homopolymers and copolymers,  especially the polymerization<br><br>

R3 is an olefin polymer and the remaining R groups are defined as above. Preferred olefin polymers include polyisobutylene, polypropylene, and polyvinylchloride. The polymeric initiator may have halogenated tertiary carbon positioned at the chain end or along or within the backbone of the polymer. When the olefin polymer has multiple halogen atoms at tertiary carbons, either pendant to or within the polymer backbone, the product may contain polymers which have a comb like structure and/or side chain branching depending on the number and placement of the halogen atoms in the olefin polymer. Likewise, the use of a chain end tertiary polymer halide initiator provides a method for producing a product which may contain block copolymers.<br>
[00122]	Particularly preferred initiators may be any of those useful in<br>
cationic polymerization of isobutylene copolymers including: hydrogen chloride, 2-chloro-2,4,4-trimethylpentane, 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, 1 -chloro-1 -methylethylbenzene, and methanol.<br>
[00123]	Catalyst system compositions useful in this invention typically<br>
comprise (1) an initiator and (2) a Lewis acid coinitiator or other metal complex described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the Lewis acid coinitiator is present anywhere from about 0.1 moles times the moles of initiator present to about 200 times the moles of initiator present. In a further preferred embodiment, the Lewis acid coinitiator is present at anywhere from about 0.8 times the moles of initiator<br><br>
present to about 20 times the moles of initiator present. In a preferred embodiment the initiator is present at anywhere from about 0.1 moles per liter to about 10"6 moles per liter. It is of course understood that greater or lesser amounts of initiator are still within the scope of this invention.<br>
[00124]	The amount of the catalyst employed will depend on desired<br>
molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymer being produced. Typically the range will be from about IxlO"6 moles .per liter to 3 x 10"2 moles per liter and most preferably from 10"4 to 10"3 moles per liter.<br>
[00125]	Catalyst systems useful in this invention may further comprise a<br>
catalyst composition comprising of a reactive cation and a weakly-coordinating anion ("WC anion" or "WCA" or "NCA"). The catalyst composition comprising the WC anion will include a reactive cation and in certain instances are novel catalyst systems.<br>
[00126]	A weakly-coordinating anion is defined as an anion which either<br>
does not coordinate to the cation or which is weakly coordinated to the cation and when the anion is functioning as the stabilizing anion in this invention the WCA does not transfer an anionic fragment or substituent to the cation thus creating a neutral by-product or other neutral compound. Preferred examples of such weakly-coordinating anions include: alkyltris(pentafluorophenyl) boron<br>
(RB(pfp)3~), tetraperfluorophenylboron (B(pfp)4~), tetraperfluorophenylaluminum<br>
carboranes, halogenated carboranes and the like. The cation is any cation that can add to an olefm to create a carbocation.<br>
[00127]	The anion may be combined with the cation by any method known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example in a preferred embodiment the WC anion is introduced into the diluent as a compound containing both the anion and the cation in the form of the active catalyst system. In another preferred embodiment a composition containing the WC anion fragment is first treated to produce the anion in the presence of the cation or reactive cation source, i.e. the<br><br>
anion is activated. Likewise the WC anion may be activated without the presence of the cation or cation source which is subsequently introduced. In a preferred embodiment a composition containing the anion and a composition containing the cation are combined and allowed to react to form a by-product, the anion and the cation.<br>
Weakly-Coordinating Anions<br>
[00128]	Any metal or metalloid compound capable of forming an anionic<br>
complex which is incapable of transferring a substituent or fragment to the cation to neutralize the cation to produce a neutral molecule may be used as the WC anion. In addition any metal or metalloid capable of forming a coordination complex which is stable in water may also be used or contained in a composition comprising the anion. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to aluminum, gold, platinum and the like. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, silicon and the like. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially. In light of this, salts containing anions comprising a coordination complex containing a single boron atom are preferred.<br>
[00129]	In general, WC anions may be represented by the following general<br>
formula:<br>
[(M')m+Qi...Qn]d-wherein:<br>
M' is a metal or metalloid;<br>
Ql to Qn are' independently, bridged or unbridged hydride radicals, dialkylamido radicals, alkoxide and aryloxide radicals, hydrocarbyl and substituted-hydrocarbyl radicals, halocarbyl and substituted-halocarbyl radicals<br><br>

m is an integer representing the formal valence charge of M;<br>
n is the total number of ligands q, and<br>
d is an integer greater than or equal to 1.<br>
[00130]	It is of course understood that the anions described above and<br>
below may be counter balanced with a positively charged component that is removed before the anion acts with the cation. The same is true for cations described for use with the anions. For example, Cp2ZrMe2 may be combined<br>
with a composition comprising the anion (WCA'R+) where R+ acts with a Me group to leave the Cp2Zr+Me WCA" catalyst system.<br>
[00131]	Preferred WC anions comprising boron may be represented by the<br>
following general formula:<br>
[BAriAr2X3X4]-<br>
wherein:<br>

hydrocarbon radicals containing from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms and may be linked to each other through a stable bridging group; and<br>

substituted-hydrocarbyl radicals, halocarbyl and substituted-halocarbyl radicals, hydrocarbyl- and halocarbyl-substituted organometalloid radicals, disubstituted pnictogen radicals, substituted chalcogen radicals and halide radicals, with the proviso that X3 and X4 will not be halide at the same time.<br>
[00132]	In general, Aq and Ar2 may, independently, be any aromatic of<br>
substituted-aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Suitable aromatic radicals include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl radicals. Suitable substituents<br><br>
on the substituted-aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, include, but are not necessarily limited to, hydrocarbyl radicals, organometalloid radicals, alkoxy and aryloxy radicals, fluorocarbyl and fluorohydrocarbyl radicals and the like such as those useful as X3 and X
hydrocarbyl radical, each may be the same or a different aromatic or substituted-aromatic radical as are Arj and Ar2, or the same may be a straight or branched alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, a cyclic hydrocarbon radical or an alkyl-substituted cyclic hydrocarbon radical. As indicated above, Arj and Ar2 could be<br>
linked to either X3 or X4- Finally, X3 and X^ may also be linked to each other through a suitable bridging group.<br>
[00133]	Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of boron components which<br>
may be used as WC anions are: tetravalent boron compounds such as<br>
tetra(phenyl)boron,	tetra(p-tolyl)boron,	tetra(o-tolyl)boron,<br>

metalloids which are useful as WC anions may be made, but such lists are not deemed necessary to a complete disclosure. In this regard, it should be noted that the foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive and that other useful boron compounds as well as useful compounds containing other metals or metalloids would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing general discussion and formulae.<br>

[00136]	Polymeric Q substituents on the most preferred anion offer the<br>
advantage of providing a highly soluble ion-exchange activator component and final catalyst. Soluble catalysts and/or precursors are often preferred over insoluble waxes, oils, or solids because they can be diluted to a desired concentration and can be transferred easily using simple equipment in commercial processes.<br>

synthesis thereof, see F.A. Cotton, G. Wilkinson, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1980. Likewise for stable forms of the cationic tin, germanium and lead compositions and synthesis thereof, see Dictionary of Organometallic compounds, Chapman and Hall New York 1984.<br><br>
D. Composition Capable of Generating a Proton<br>
[00149]	A fourth source for the cation is any compound that will produce a<br>
proton when combined with the weakly-coordinating anion or a composition containing a weakly-coordinating anion. Protons may be generated from the reaction of a stable carbocation salt which contains a weakly-coordinating, non-nucleophilic anion with water, alcohol or phenol present to produce the proton and the corresponding by-product, (ether in the case of an alcohol or phenol and alcohol in the case of water). Such reaction may be preferred in the event that the reaction of the carbocation salt is faster with the protonated additive as compared with its reaction with the olefin. Other proton generating reactants include thiols, carboxylic acids, and the like. Similar chemistries may be realized with silylium type catalysts. In a particularly preferred embodiment, when Rj, R2 and R3 are<br>
phenyl groups, the addition of an aliphatic or aromatic alcohol significantly enhances the polymerization of isobutylene.<br>
[00150]	Another method to generate a proton comprises combining a group<br>
1 or group 2 metal, preferably lithium, with water, such as by means of in a wet diluent, in the presence of a Lewis base that does not interfere with polymerization, such as an olefin. It has been observed that when a Lewis base, such as isobutylene, is present with the group 1 or 2 metal and the water, a proton is generated. In a preferred embodiment the weakly-coordinating anion is also present in the "wet" diluent such that active catalyst is generated when the group 1 or 2 metal is added.<br>
ACTIVE CATALYST SYSTEM<br>
A. Cyclopentadienyl Transition Metal Compounds<br>
[00151]	The Cp transition metal cations (CpTm+) can be combined into an<br>
active catalyst in at least two ways.   A first method is to combine a compound<br><br>
comprising the CpTm+ with a second compound comprising the WCA" which then react to form by-product and the active "weakly-coordinating" pair. Likewise, the CpTm+ compound may also be directly combined with the WCA" to form the active catalyst system. Typically the WCA is combined with the<br>
cation/cation source in ratios of 1 to 1, however ratios of 100 to 1 (CpTm+ to WCA) also work in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00152]	Active cationic catalysts can be prepared by reacting a transition<br>
metal compound with some neutral Lewis acids, such as B(C6F6)3n&gt; which upon reaction with a hydrolyzable ligand (X) of the transition metal compound forms an anion, such as ([B(CgF5)3(X)]"), which stabilizes the cationic transition metal species generated by the reaction.<br>
[00153]	A novel aspect of this invention is the active carbocationic catalyst<br>
complex which is formed and which can be represented by the formulae:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
 and<br><br><br><br>
wherein each G is independently hydrogen or an aromatic or aliphatic group, preferably a C\ to C\QQ aliphatic group, and g is an integer representing the<br>
number of monomer units incorporated into the growing polymer chain, g is preferably a number greater than or equal to 1, preferably a number from 1 to<br>
about 150,000. WCA" is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above. All other symbols are as defined above.<br>
[00154]	In another embodiment this invention also provides active catalyst<br>
compositions which can be represented by the formulae:<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein each G is independently a aliphatic or aromatic group, preferably a C\ to CIOQ aliphatic or aromatic group, and g is a n integer representing the number of<br>
monomer units incorporated into the growing polymer chain, g is preferably a number greater than or equal to 1, preferably a number from 1 to about 50,000.<br><br>
WCA' is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above. All other symbols are as defined above.<br>
B. Substituted Carbocation and Silylium Compounds<br>
[00155]	Generation of trisubstituted carbocations and silylium cations may<br>
be performed before use in the polymerization or in situ. Pre-formation and isolation of the cation or the stable cation salts may be accomplished by reacting the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of the weakly-coordinating anion with the corresponding halogen of the potential carbocation or silylium similarly to methods known in the art. Formation of the substituted carbocations or silylium in situ occurs in a similar manner to stable salts, but within the vessel and at the desired temperature of polymerization. The advantage of the latter procedure is that it is capable of producing carbocations or silylium cations otherwise too unstable to be handled by the first method. The cation or the precursor to the cation is typically used in 1 to 1 ratios with the WCA, however ratios of 1 to 100<br>
(C+ or Si+ to WCA) also work in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00156]	A novel aspect of this invention is the active carbocationic catalyst<br>
complex which is formed and which can be represented by the formulae:<br>
R<br><br>
R-<br><br>

WCA~ is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above.   All other symbols are as defined above.<br>
[00157]	Yet   another   novel   aspect   of  this   invention   is   the   active<br>
carbocationic catalyst complex which is formed and which can be represented by the formulae:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein each G is independently hydrogen or an aliphatic or aromatic group, preferably a Cj to CIQO aliphatic group, and g is a n integer representing the<br>
number of monomer units incorporated into the growing polymer chain, g is preferably a number greater than or equal to 1, preferably a number from 1 to<br>
about 150,000. WCA" is any weakly-coordinating anion as described above. All other symbols are as defined above.<br>

[00158]	In addition cationic compositions of germanium, tin or lead, may<br>
be used in combination with the WCA's described herein. Preferred compositions include those which are represented by the formula:<br>
R—R*<br><br>
wherein R], R2 and R^ are hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl groups or derivatives thereof, preferably C\ to €30 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl groups or derivatives thereof, and R* is Ge, Sn or Pb. In a preferred embodiment the R groups are a C\ to C\Q alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, or butyl.<br>

invention, alone or in combination with other hydrofluorocarbons or in combination with other diluents. For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, hydrofluorocarbons ("HFC's" or "HFC") are defined to be saturated or unsaturated compounds consisting essentially of hydrogen, carbon and fluorine, provided that at least one carbon, at least one hydrogen and at least one fluorine are present.<br>

[00163]	In one embodiment, the  diluent  comprises non-perfluorinated<br>
compounds or the diluent is a non-perfluorinated diluent. Perfluorinated compounds being those compounds consisting of carbon and fluorine. However, in another embodiment, when the diluent comprises a blend, the blend may comprise perfluorinated compound, preferably, the catalyst, monomer, and diluent are present in a single phase or the aforementioned components are miscible with<br><br>
the diluent as described in further detail below. In another embodiment, the blend may also comprise chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), or those compounds consisting of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon.<br>
[00164]	In another embodiment, when higher weight average molecular<br>
weights (Mw) (typically greater than 10,000 Mw, preferably more than 50,000 Mw, more preferably more than 100,000 Mw) are desired, suitable diluents include hydrofluorocarbons with a dielectric constant of greater than 10 at -85°C, preferably greater than 15, more preferably greater than 20, more preferably greater than 25, more preferably 40 or more. In embodiments where lower molecular weights (typically lower than 10,000 Mw, preferably less than 5,000 Mw, more preferably less than 3,000 Mw) are desired the dielectric constant may be less than 10, or by adding larger amounts of initiator or transfer agent when the dielectric constant is above 10. The dielectric constant of the diluent ED is determined from measurements of the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor immersed in the diluent [measured value CD], in a reference fluid of known dielectric constant ER [measured value CR], and in air (EA=!) [measured value CA]. In each case the measured capacitance CM is given by CM= £Cc+Cs, where e is the dielectric constant of the fluid in which the capacitor is immersed, Cc is the cell capacitance, and C$ is the stray capacitance. From these measurements ED is given by the formula eD=((CD-CA) ER + (CR-CD))/(CR-CA). Alternatively, a purpose-built instrument such as the Brookhaven Instrument Corporation BIC-870 may be used to measure dielectric constant of diluents directly. A comparison of the dielectric constants (E) of a few selected diluents at -85°C is provided below and graphically depicted in Figure 1.<br><br><br>

between 35 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 40 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 45 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 50 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 55 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 60 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 65 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 70 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 75 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 80 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 85 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 90 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 95 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 97 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 98 and 100 volume %, and alternatively between 99 and 100 volume %. In a preferred embodiment the HFC is blended with one or more chlorinated hydrocarbons. In another preferred embodiment the HFC is selected from the group consisting of difluoromethane, trifluoromethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00170]	In another embodiment the diluent or diluent mixture is selected<br>
based upon its solubility in the polymer. Certain diluents are soluble in the polymer. Preferred diluents have little to no solubility in the polymer. Solubility in the polymer is measured by forming the polymer into a film of thickness between 50 and 100 microns, then soaking it in diluent (enough to cover the film) for 4 hours at -75°C. The film is removed from the diluent, exposed to room temperature for 90 seconds to evaporate excess diluent from the surface of the film, and weighed. The mass uptake is defined as the percentage increase in the film weight after soaking. The diluent or diluent mixture is chosen so that the polymer has a mass uptake of less than 4 wt%, preferably less than 3 wt%, preferably less than 2 wt%, preferably less than 1 wt%, more preferably less than 0.5 wt%.<br>
[00171]	In a preferred embodiment, the diluent or diluent mixture is<br>
selected such that the difference between the measured glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer with less than 0.1 wt% of any diluent, unreacted monomers and additives is within 15°C of the Tg of the polymer measured after it has been formed into a film of thickness between 50 and 100 microns, that has<br><br>
been soaked in diluent (enough to cover the film) for 4 hours at -75°C. The glass transition temperature is determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Techniques are well described in the literature, for example, B. Wunderlich, "The Nature of the Glass Transition and its Determination by Thermal Analysis", in Assignment of the Glass Transition, ASTM STP 1249, R. J. Seyler, Ed., American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 1994, pp. 17-31. The sample is prepared as described above, sealed immediately after soaking into a DSC sample pan, and maintained at a temperature below -80°C until immediately before the DSC measurement. Preferably the Tg values are within 12°C of each other, preferably within 11°C of each other, preferably within 10°C of each other, preferably within 9°C of each other, preferably within 8°C of each other, preferably within 7°C of each other, preferably within 6°C of each other, preferably within 5°C of each other, preferably within 4°C of each other, preferably within 3°C of each other, preferably within 3°C of each other, preferably within 2°C of each other, preferably within 1 °C of each other.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
[00172]	The invention may be practiced in continuous and batch processes.<br>
Further the invention may be practiced in a plug flow reactor and/or stirred tank reactors. In particular this invention may be practiced in "butyl reactors." Illustrative examples include any reactor selected from the group consisting of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor, a plug flow reactor, a moving belt or drum reactor, a jet or nozzle reactor, a tubular reactor, and an autorefrigerated boiling-pool reactor.<br>
[00173]	In another aspect, heat can be removed by use of heat transfer<br>
surfaces, such as in a tubular reactor where a coolant is on one side of the tube and the polymerizing mixture is on the other side. Heat may also be removed by evaporating the polymerizing mixture, such as may be found in an autorefrigerated boiling pool type reactor. Another example, is a plug flow reactor where a portion of the polymerizing mixture is evaporated as the mixture<br><br>
proceeds through the reactor. Another example is where heat is removed in a plug flow reactor through surface heat transfer using coolant on the other side of a heat transfer surface. Another example would be a reactor where polymerization takes place on a moving belt or drum where the diluent/monomer/catalyst mixture is sprayed onto the belt or drum and heat is removed by evaporation of the diluent as the reaction proceeds. In addition heat may be removed in such reactors by surface heat transfer (such as where the coolant is present on the inside of the drum or under the belt and the polymer is produced on the other side of the belt or drum). Another type of reactor is a jet or nozzle reactor. These reactors have a short residence time where the monomer, diluent and catalyst system are combined in the jet or nozzle and the polymerization occurs as the mixture passes through the nozzle at high velocity.<br>
[00174]	Preferred reactors include continuous flow stirred tank reactors,<br>
whether operating in batch or continuous mode, and whether operating in a tank with an agitator or in a tube type reactor. Preferred reactors also include reactors where the polymerization occurs on one side of a heat transfer surface and the coolant is present on the other side. An example is a reactor where tubes containing coolant run inside the reactor polymerization zone. Another example would be where the polymerization occurs inside a tube and the coolant is present on the outside of the tube in a shell.<br>
[00175]	This invention may also be practiced in batch reactors where the<br>
monomers, diluent, and catalyst are charged to the reactor and then polymerization proceeds to completion (such as by quenching) and the polymer is then recovered.<br>
[00176]	In certain embodiments, the invention is practiced using a slurry<br>
polymerization process. However, other polymerization methods are contemplated such as a solution polymerization process. The polymerization processes of the invention may be cationic polymerization processes.<br><br>
 [00177]	In one embodiment, the polymerization is carried out where the<br>
catalyst, monomer, and diluent are present in a single phase. Preferably, the polymerization is carried-out in a continuous polymerization process in which the catalyst, monomer(s), and diluent are present as a single phase. In slurry polymerization, the monomers, catalyst(s), and initiator(s) are all miscible in the diluent or diluent mixture, i.e., constitute a single phase, while the polymer precipitates from the diluent with good separation from the diluent. Desirably, reduced or no polymer "swelling" is exhibited as indicated by little or no Tg suppression of the polymer and/or little or no diluent mass uptake as shown in Figure 2. Thus, polymerization in the diluents of the present invention provides for high polymer concentration to be handled at low viscosity with good heat transfer, reduced reactor fouling, homogeneous polymerization and/or the convenience of subsequent reactions to be run directly on the resulting polymer mixture.<br>
[00178]	The reacted monomers within the reactor form part of a slurry.  In<br>
one embodiment, the concentration of the solids in the slurry is equal to or greater than 10 vol%. In another embodiment, the concentration of solids in the slurry is present in the reactor equal to or greater than 25 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in the slurry is less than or equal to 75 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry is present in the reactor from 1 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry is present in the reactor from 5 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 10 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 15 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 20 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 25 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 30 to 70 vol%. In yet another embodiment, the<br><br>
concentration of solids in slurry concentration is present in the reactor from 40 to 70 vol%.<br>
[00179]	Typically, a continuous flow stirred tank-type reactor may be used.<br>
The reactor is generally fitted with an efficient agitation means, such as a turbo-mixer or impeller(s), an external cooling jacket and/or internal cooling tubes and/or coils, or other means of removing the heat of polymerization to maintain the desired reaction temperature, inlet means (such as inlet pipes) for monomers, diluents and catalysts (combined or separately), temperature sensing means, and an effluent overflow or outflow pipe which withdraws polymer, diluent and unreacted monomers among other things, to a holding drum or quench tank. Preferably, the reactor is purged of air and moisture. One skilled in the art will recognize proper assembly and operation.<br>
[00180]	The reactors are preferably designed to deliver good mixing of the<br>
catalyst and monomers within the reactor, good turbulence across or within the heat transfer tubes or coils, and enough fluid flow throughout the reaction volume to avoid excessive polymer accumulation or separation from the diluent.<br>
[00181]	Other reactors that may be utilized in the practice of the present<br>
invention include any conventional reactors and equivalents thereof capable of performing a continuous slurry process, such as disclosed in U.S. 5,417,930, herein incorporated by reference. The reactor pump impeller can be of the up-pumping variety or the down-pumping variety. The reactor will contain sufficient amounts of the catalyst system of the present invention effective to catalyze the polymerization of the monomer containing feed-stream such that a sufficient amount of polymer having desired characteristics is produced. The feed-stream in one embodiment contains a total monomer concentration greater than 5 wt% (based on the total weight of the monomers, diluent, and catalyst system), preferably greater than 15 wt%, greater than 30 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the feed-stream will contain from 5 wt% to 50 wt%<br><br>
monomer concentration based on the total weight of monomer, diluent, and catalyst system.<br>
[00182]	In some embodiments, the feed-stream is substantially free from<br>
silica cation producing species. By substantially free of silica cation producing species, it is meant that there is no more than 0.0005 wt% based on the total weight of the monomers of these silica cation producing species in the feed stream. Typical examples of silica cation producing species are halo-alkyl silica compounds having the formula R^RsSiX or RiR2SiX2, etc., wherein "R" is an alkyl and "X" is a halogen. The reaction conditions will be such that desirable temperature, pressure and residence time are effective to maintain the reaction medium in the liquid state and to produce the desired polymers having the desired characteristics. The monomer feed-stream is typically substantially free of any impurity which is adversely reactive with the catalyst under the polymerization conditions. For example, In some embodiments, the monomer feed preferably should be substantially free of bases (such as caustic), sulfur-containing compounds (such as H2S, COS, and organo-mercaptans, e.g., methyl mercaptan, ethyl mercaptan), nitrogen-containing bases, oxygen containing bases such as alcohols and the like. However monomer feed may be less pure, typically not less than 95% based on total olefinic content, more preferably not less than 98%, not less than 99%. In preferred embodiments the impurities are present at less than 10,000 ppm (by weight), preferably less that 500 ppm, preferably less than 250 ppm, preferably less than 150 ppm, preferably less than 100 ppm.<br>
[00183]	As is normally the case, reaction time, temperature, concentration,<br>
the nature of the reactants, and similar factors determine product molecular weights. The polymerization reaction temperature is conveniently selected based on the target polymer molecular weight and the monomer to be polymerized as well as standard process variable and economic considerations, e.g., rate, temperature control, etc. The temperature for the polymerization is less than 0°C, preferably between -10°C and the freezing point of the slurry in one embodiment, and from -25°C to -120°C in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment,<br><br>
the polymerization temperature is from -40°C to -100°C, and from -70°C to -100°C in yet another embodiment. In yet another desirable embodiment, the temperature range is from -80°C to -100°C. Consequently, different reaction conditions will produce products of different molecular weights. Synthesis of the desired reaction product may be achieved, therefore, through monitoring the course of the reaction by the examination of samples taken periodically during the reaction; a technique widely employed in the art.<br>
[00184]	In a preferred embodiment, the polymerization temperature is<br>
within 10°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 8°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 6°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 4°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 2°C above the freezing point of the diluent, preferably within 1°C above the freezing point of the diluent. For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto when the phrase "within X°C above the freezing point of the diluent" is used it means the freezing point of the diluent plus X ° C. For example if the freezing point of the diluent is -98°C, then 10°C above the freezing point of the diluent is -88°C.<br>
[00185]	The reaction pressure will be from above 0 to 14,000 kPa in one<br>
embodiment (where 0 kPa is a total vacuum), from 7 kPa to 12,000 kPa in another embodiment, from 100 kPa to 2000 kPa in another embodiment, from 200 kPa to 1500 kPa in another embodiment, from 200 kPa to 1200 kPa in another embodiment, and from 200 kPa to 1000 kPa in yet another embodiment, from 7 kPa to 100 kPa in another embodiment, from 20 kPa to 70 kPa in another embodiment, from 40 kPa to 60 kPa in yet another embodiment, from 1000 kPa to 14,000 kPa in another embodiment, from 3000 kPa to 10,000 kPa in another embodiment, and from 3,000 kPa to 6,000 kPa in yet another embodiment.<br>
[00186]	The  order  of contacting  the   monomer  feed-stream,   catalyst,<br>
initiator, and diluent may vary from one embodiment to another.<br><br>
 [00187]	In another embodiment, the initiator and Lewis acid are pre-<br>
contacted by mixing together in the selected diluent for a prescribed amount of time ranging from 0.01 second to 10 hours, and then is injected into the continuous reactor through a catalyst nozzle or injection apparatus. In yet another embodiment, Lewis acid and the initiator are added to the reactor separately. In another embodiment, the initiator is blended with the feed monomers before injection to the reactor. Desirably, the monomer is not contacted with the Lewis acid, or the Lewis acid combined with the initiator before the monomers enter the reactor.<br>
[00188]	In an embodiment of the invention, the initiator and Lewis acid are<br>
allowed to pre-contact by mixing together in the selected diluent at temperatures between -40 °C and the freezing point temperature of the diluent, with a contact time between 0.01 seconds and several hours, and between 0.1 seconds and 5 minutes, preferably less than 3 minutes, preferably between 0.2 seconds and 1 minute before injection into the reactor.<br>
[00189]	In another embodiment of the invention, the initiator and Lewis<br>
acid are allowed to pre-contact by mixing together in the selected diluent at temperatures between 80 and -150°C, typically between -40°C and -98°C.<br>
[00190]	The overall residence time in the reactor can vary, depending upon,<br>
e.g., catalyst activity and concentration, monomer concentration, feed injection rate, production rate, reaction temperature, and desired molecular weight, and generally will be between about a few seconds and five hours, and typically between about 10 and 60 minutes. Variables influencing residence time include the monomer and diluent feed injection rates and the overall reactor volume.<br>
[00191]	The catalyst (Lewis acid) to monomer ratio utilized will be those<br>
conventional in this art for carbocationic polymerization processes. In one embodiment of the invention, the monomer to catalyst mole ratios will typically be from 500 to 10000, and in the range of 2000 to 6500 in another embodiment.<br><br>
In yet another desirable embodiment, the ratio of Lewis acid to initiator is from 0.5 to 10, or from 0.75 to 8. The overall concentration of the initiator in the reactor is typically from 5 to 300 ppm or 10 to 250 ppm. The concentration of the initiator in the catalyst feed stream is typically from 50 to 3000 ppm in one embodiment. Another way to describe the amount of initiator in the reactor is by its amount relative to the polymer. In one embodiment, there is from 0.25 to 20 moles polymer/mole initiator, and from 0.5 to 12 mole polymer/mole initiator in another embodiment.<br>
[00192]	The reactor will contain sufficient amounts of the catalyst system<br>
of the present invention to catalyze the polymerization of the monomer containing feed-stream such that a sufficient amount of polymer having desired characteristics is produced. The feed-stream in one embodiment contains a total monomer concentration greater than 20 wt% (based on the total weight of the monomers, diluent, and catalyst system), greater than 25 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the feed-stream will contain from 30 wt% to 50 wt% monomer concentration based on the total weight of monomer, diluent, and catalyst system.<br>
[00193]	Catalyst  efficiency  (based  on  Lewis  acid)  in the  reactor is<br>
maintained between 10,000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst and 300 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst and desirably in the range of 4000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst to 1000 pounds of polymer per pound of catalyst by controlling the molar ratio of Lewis acid to initiator.<br>
[00194]	In    one    embodiment,    the    polymerization    of    cationically<br>
polymerizable monomers (such as polymerization of isobutylene and isoprene to form butyl rubber) comprises several steps. First, a reactor having a pump impeller capable of up-pumping or down-pumping is provided. The pump impeller is typically driven by an electric motor with a measurable amperage. The reactor typically is equipped with parallel vertical reaction tubes within a jacket containing liquid ethylene. The total internal volume, including the tubes, is<br><br>
greater than 30 to 50 liters, thus capable of large scale volume polymerization reactions. The reactor typically uses liquid ethylene to draw the heat of the polymerization reaction away from the forming slurry. The pump impeller keeps a constant flow of slurry, diluent, catalyst system and unreacted monomers through the reaction tubes. A feed-stream of the cationically polymerizable monomer(s) (such as isoprene and isobutylene) in a polar diluent is charged into the reactor, the feed-stream containing less than 0.0005 wt% of cation producing silica compounds, and typically free of aromatic monomers. The catalyst system is then charged into the reactor, the catalyst system having a Lewis acid and an initiator present in a molar ratio of from 0.50 to 10.0. Within the reactor, the feed-stream of monomers and catalyst system are allowed to contact one another, the reaction thus forming a slurry of polymer (such as butyl rubber), wherein the solids in the slurry has a concentration of from 20 vol% to 50 vol%. Finally, the thus formed polymer (such as butyl rubber) is allowed to exit the reactor through an outlet or outflow line while simultaneously allowing the feed-stream charging to continue, thus constituting the continuous slurry polymerization. Advantageously, the present invention improves this process in a number of ways, e.g., by ultimately reducing the amount of polymer accumulation on the reactor walls, heat transfer surfaces, agitators and/or impeller(s), and in the outflow line or exit port, as measured by pressure inconsistencies or "jumps."<br>
[00195]	In one embodiment, the resultant polymer from one embodiment of<br>
the invention is a polyisobutylene/isoprene polymer (butyl rubber) that has a molecular weight distribution of from about 2 to 5, and an unsaturation of from 0.5 to 2.5 mole per 100 mole of monomer. This product may be subjected to subsequent halogenation to afford a halogenated butyl rubber.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS<br>
[00197]	The polymers of the invention provide chemical and physical<br>
characteristics that make them highly useful in wide variety of applications. The low degree of permeability to gases accounts for the largest uses of these polymers, namely inner tubes and tire innerliners. These same properties are also of importance in air cushions, pneumatic springs, air bellows, accumulator bags, and pharmaceutical closures. The thermal stability of the polymers of the invention make them ideal for rubber tire-curing bladders, high temperature service hoses, and conveyor belts for hot material handling.<br>
[00198]	The polymers exhibit high damping and have uniquely broad<br>
damping and shock absorption ranges in both temperature and frequency. They are useful in molded rubber parts and find wide applications in automobile suspension bumpers, auto exhaust hangers, and body mounts.<br>
[00199]	The polymers of the instant invention are also useful in tire<br>
sidewalls and tread compounds. In sidewalls, the polymer characteristics impart good ozone resistance, crack cut growth, and appearance. The polymers of the invention may also be blended. Properly formulated blends with high diene rubbers that exhibit phase co-continuity yield excellent sidewalls. Improvements in wet, snow, and ice skid resistances and in dry traction without compromises in<br><br>
abrasion resistance and rolling resistance for high performance tires can be accomplished by using the polymers of the instant invention.<br>
[00200]	Blends of the polymers of the invention with thermoplastic resins<br>
are used for toughening of these compounds. High-density polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene are often modified with 5 to 30 wt % of polyisobutylene. In certain applications, the instant polymers provide for a highly elastic compound that is processable in thermoplastic molding equipment. The polymers of the instant invention may also be blended with polyamides to produce other industrial applications.<br>
[00201]	The polymers of the instant invention may also be used as<br>
adhesives, caulks, sealants, and glazing compounds. They are also useful as plasticizers in rubber formulations with butyl, SBR, and natural rubber. In linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) blends, they induce cling to stretch-wrap films. They are also widely employed in lubricants as dispersants and in potting and electrical cable filling materials.<br>
[00202]	In certain applications, the polymers of the invention make them<br>
also useful in chewing-gum, as well as in medical applications such as pharmaceutical stoppers, and the arts for paint rollers.<br>
[00203]	The following examples reflect embodiments of the invention and<br>
are by no means intended to be limiting of the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[00204]	The   polymerizations   were   performed   glass   reaction   vessels,<br>
equipped with a teflon turbine impeller on a glass stir shaft driven by an external electrically driven stirrer. The size and design of the glass vessels is noted for each set of examples. The head of the reactor included ports for the stir shaft, thermocouple and addition of initiator/coinitiator solutions. The reactor was<br><br>
cooled to the desired reaction temperature, listed in the Tables, by immersing the assembled reactor into a pentane or isohexane bath in the dry box. The temperature of the stirred hydrocarbon bath was controlled to ± 2°C. All apparatus in liquid contact with the reaction medium were dried at 120°C and cooled in a nitrogen atmosphere before use. Isobutylene (Matheson or ExxonMobil) and methyl chloride (Air Products) were dried by passing the gas through three stainless steel columns containing barium oxide and were condensed and collected as liquids in the dry box. Alternatively, methyl chloride was dried by passing the gas through stainless steel columns containing silica gel and molecular sieves. Both materials were condensed and collected as liquids in the dry box. Isoprene (Aldrich) was dried over calcium hydride and distilled under Argon. p-Methylstyrene (Aldrich) was dried over calcium hydride and distilled under vacuum. TMPCI (2-chloro-2,4,4,-trimethylpentane) was prepared from 2,4,4-trimethylpentene-l and a 2.0 mol/L solution of HCI in diethyl ether. The TMPCI was distilled before use. The HCI (Aldrich, 99% pure) stock solution was prepared by dissolving a desirable amount of HCI gas in dry MeCl to achieve 2-3 % concentration by weight. The hydrofluorocarbons that were collected as clear, colorless liquids at -95°C were used as received. Hydrofluorocarbons that remained cloudy or had visible insoluble precipitates at -95°C were distilled before use. Propane (Aldrich), used as received, was condensed and used as a liquid. Alkylaluminum dichlorides (Aldrich) were used as hydrocarbon solutions. These solutions were either purchased or prepared from the neat alkylaluminum dichloride.<br>
[00205]	The   slurry   copolymerizations   were   performed   by   dissolving<br>
monomer and comonomer into the liquefied hydrofluorocarbon at polymerization temperature and stirred at a pre-determined stirring speed between 800 to 1000 rpm. The use of a processor controlled electric stirring motor allowed control of the stirring speed to within 5 rpm. The initiator/coinitiator solutions were prepared either in the hydrofluorocarbon or, for convenience of small-scale experiments, in a small volume of methyl chloride. The initiator/coinitiator solutions were prepared by dissolving the initiator into the diluent (specified in<br><br>
each of the examples) and adding, with mixing, a 1.0 M solution of the alkylaluminum halide. The initiator/coinitiator solution was used immediately. The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization using a chilled glass Pasteur pipette or, optionally, a jacketed dropping funnel for examples using the 500 ml glass reaction vessels. When a second or third initiator/coinitiator addition is specified in the examples, we refer to the preparation and addition of a second or third batch of freshly prepared initiator/coinitiator solution identical in volume and concentrations to the first batch. The physical behavior of the rubber particles and the state of fouling was determined at the end of the addition of each catalyst batch by stopping and removing the stir shaft and probing the particles with a chilled spatula. Stirring was begun again and the reaction quenched with the addition of greater than 100 microliters of methanol. Conversion is reported as weight percent of the monomers converted to polymer.<br>
[00206]	Polymer  molecular  weights  were   determined   by   SEC   (Size<br>
Exclusion Chromatography) using a Waters Alliance 2690 separations module equipped with column heaters and a Waters 410 differential refractometer detector. Tetrahydrofuran was used as eluent (1 ml/min., 35°C) with a set of Waters Styragel HR 5u columns of 500, 1000, 2000, 104, 105 and 106A pore size. A calibration based on narrow molecular weight polyisobutylene standards (American Polymer Standards) was used to calculate molecular weights and distributions.<br>
[00207]	Polymer molecular weights can be determined on other SEC<br>
instruments using different calibration and run protocols. The methodolgy of SEC (also know as GPC or gel permeation chromatography) to characterize polymer molecular weights has been reviewed in many publications.

 [00208]	Comonomer    incorporation    was    determined    by     'H-NMR<br>
spectrometry. NMR measurements were obtained at a field strength corresponding to 400 MHz or 500 MHz. 'H-NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer system using CDCb solutions of the polymers. All chemical shifts were referenced to TMS.<br>
[00209]	The BSB (B = isobutylene, S = p-methylstyrene) triad fraction was<br>
obtained from 'H NMR spectrometry at a field strength of 400 or 500 MHz. Polymer samples were dissolved into CDCla at 1-2 w/v%. The free induction decays were collected on the deuterated chloroform solutions with a 45° pulse, 1 second recycle delay and a 3.96 second acquisition time. All chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane.<br>
[00210]	The BSB triad resonance was assigned according to information<br>
reported in J. R. Ashbaugh, C. J. Ruff, T. D. Shaffer J. Polym. Sci., A. Polym. Chem. 2000, 38, 1680, herein incorporated by reference. The percentage of BSB triads in the copolymer was calculated from the 'H-NMR spectrum according to the following equation.<br>
% BSB = 100 (4A/(A+B))<br>
where: A = integral value of the 2.8 ppm resonance<br>
B = integral value of resonances between 2.6 and 2.2 ppm<br>
[00211]	For the purposes of this invention, the relationship between the<br>
BSB triad fraction and the mol% p-alkylstyrene incorporated into the copolymer is described by the copolymer sequence distribution equation described below and is characterized by the copolymer sequence distribution parameter, m.<br>
FBSB = 1 - {m A / (1 + mA)}<br>
where: m is the copolymer sequence distribution parameter,<br><br>
A is the molar ratio of isoprene to isobutylene in the copolymer,<br>
[pMS]/[IB] and,<br>
FBSB is the BSB triad fraction in the copolymer.<br>
[00212]	The BSB and mol% p-methylstyrene (p-MS) data obtained by *H-<br>
NMR spectrometry was fit by iterative solution of the copolymer sequence distribution equation to obtain a best fit. The best fit of this equation yields the sequence distribution parameter, m, for copolymerization of isobutylene and p-methylstyrene in each diluent.<br>
[00213]	A variety  of NMR methods have  been used to  characterize<br>
comonomer incorporation and sequence distribution in copolymers. Many of these methods may be applicable to the polymers of this invention.

Polymerization in 1,1,1-trichloroethane occurred in solution. Polymer was recovered by removing weathering off the solvent.<br>

[00242]	Table  17 lists the results of copolymerizations of isobutylene<br>
isoprene that were conducted at -95°C CH2FCF3. The isobutylene/isoprene feed ratio was changed for each example. A three-neck 500 ml glass reactor was used for these examples. Prior to each polymerization, 300 ml of monomer feed containing 10 wt% of monomers were charged into the chilled reactor. The initiator/coinitiator molar ratio was controlled at 1/3 and the concentration was set at 0.1 wt% EADC in MeCl. The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization mixture and the rate of addition is controlled in such as way<br>
so that the reactor temperature raise did not exceed 4°C. The amount of initiator/coinitiator solution added in each depended on the desired monomer conversion target.<br><br>

 [00243]	These examples demonstrate the preparation of high molecular<br>
weight copolymers with high isoprene incorporation. The agglomeration of the slurry particles is significantly reduced in the hydrofluorocarbon. The GPC traces of these isobutylene/isoprene copolymers do not show any sign of gel formation or cross-linking, even for the Example 146 which contains more than 5 mol% isoprene. The high diene isobutylene/isoprene polymers made according to this invention can be halogenated subsequently via standard, established halogenation processes for making halobutyl polymers.<br>
Example 147<br>
[00244]	The   dependence   of   molecular   weight   on   conversion   was<br>
determined for isobutylene/isoprene copolymerizations run in methyl chloride and CH^FCFa at -95°C. This dependence was determined for two different initiator/coinitiator systems; one based on TMPC1 and the other based on HC1. Both catalyst systems used EADC as the Lewis acid coinitiator. A three-neck 500 ml glass reactor was used for these examples. Prior to each polymerization, 300 ml of monomer feed containing 10 wt% of the monomers were charged into the chilled reactor. A molar ratio of 95/5 isobutylene/isoprene was used for each polymerization. The initiator/coinitiator molar ratio was controlled at 1/3 and the<br><br>
concentration was set at 0.1 wt% EADC in MeCl. The initiator/coinitiator solution was added dropwise to the polymerization mixture and the rate of addition is<br>
O<br>
controlled in such as way so that the reactor temperature raise did not exceed 4 C. The amount of initiator/coinitiator solution added in each depended on the desired monomer conversion target. The data for these polymerizations are shown in Figure 3 as a plot of peak molecular weight (Mp) versus the monomer conversion in wt%. The expected decline of molecular weight with increasing conversion is observed. These data also show that HC1 is a preferred initiator for copolymerizations in<br>
Example 148<br>
[00245]	A   copolymerization   of  isobutylene   and   cyclopentadiene  was<br>
conducted at -93 °C in CH2FCF3. A molar ratio of 97/3 of isobutylene / cyclopentadiene was used for this polymerization at 10.8 wt% monomers in the feed. Cyclopentadiene was freshly cracked for this experiment. The initiator/coinitiator solution was prepared by dissolving 200 microliters of a 1 .0 mol/L solution of hydrogen chloride in CF^FCFs into 50 ml of pre-chilled CHiFCFs. To this solution was added 500 microliters of a 1 .0 mol/L solution of ethylaluminum dichloride in hexane. This solution was stirred for 5 minutes. Polymerization was begun by the dropwise addition of the initiator/coinitiator solution into the monomer solution with stirring. The addition of this solution was maintained at a rate necessary to keep the polymerization temperature from rising above -92°C. A total of 35 ml of the initiator/coinitiator solution was used. A 500 ml glass resin kettle was used for this example.<br>

Solubility of Ethylaluminum Dichloride in Hydrofluorocarbons and Blends<br>
[00246]	The solubility tests reported in Tables 19-25 were performed<br>
using neat ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC). Each test was performed in the following way. 5 ml of the condensed hydrofluorocarbon were charged into a dried test tube cooled to -90°C in the dry box cold bath. To this liquid at -9Q°C, 4.1 microliters of neat, liquid ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC) was added. Solubility was checked by vigorously agitating the resulting mixture. The mixture was then allowed to warm to the boiling point of the diluent while agitating the contents of the test tube. After the diluent reached its boiling point, the mixture was cooled to -90°C by immersing the test tube into the cold bath. Reported observations were made after the completed heating/cooling cycle. If after this first heat/cool cycle, the catalyst did not dissolve, 0.5 ml of methyl chloride was added. The heat/cool cycle was repeated. Subsequent additions of 0.5 ml of methyl chloride were made following each heat/cool cycle until the EADC was observed to dissolve or a 50/50 V/V blend was achieved. The following observations were made and recorded,<br>

1.0 mol/L stock hydrocarbon solutions of ethylaluminum dichloride (EADC) prepared at room temperature from neat EADC and the hydrocarbon listed in the table. Pentane refers to normal pentane. ULB hexanes refers to an ultra low benzene grade of hexanes, an isomeric mixture, which contains less than 5 ppm<br><br>

The final 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) solution was prepared by adding the room temperature EADC stock solution, volume listed in the table, to the liquid HFC-134a in a test tube held at -35°C. In all cases, an initial solution is obtained which is clear and colorless. The resulting solution was then cooled by immersing the test tube into the dry box cold bath thermostated at -95 °C. The cloud point was determined by monitoring the temperature of the liquid with a thermometer and visually determining the onset of cloudiness. The solutions again became clear by allowing the solutions to warm to a temperature above the cloud point. The behavior of the solution around the cloud point was observed for several minutes by repeatedly cooling and warming the solution. This phenomenon was found to be reproducible.<br>
