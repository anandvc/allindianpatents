				<td>MEDICAL SKIN APPLICATOR APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to medical skin applicators, and<br>
more particularly, to a skin applicator apparatus adapted to uniformally and consistently<br>
dispense sterilizing fluid to a skin surface of a patient.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Many medical procedures involve application of medicines, sterilizing<br>
fluids, antiseptics, gels, agents or other materials to portions of the body, such as the skin,<br>
for preparation, treatment, etc. Such medicines, sterilizing fluids, agents are typically<br>
transferred to the skin via an applicator. Conventional liquid applicators incorporate a<br>
glass ampoule or plastic blow-molded bottles for storing the liquid and a mechanism for<br>
fracturing the ampoule to release the stored liquid. The released liquid contacts a swab,<br>
foam pad or tip for application to the skin.<br>
However, numerous problems are encountered with applicators of this<br>
type. Fracture of the glass ampoule generates shards within the applicator that may pose<br>
risks to a patient. Attempts to overcome these potential risks include devices that employ<br>
screens or foam to contain the glass shards. However, there still exists a possibility of<br>
introducing these shards into the fluid pathway, which poses an unacceptable and<br>
unnecessary risk to the patient.<br>
Another drawback of the above mentioned devices is the permeation of<br>
certain gases through the seals of bottles as well as the plastic of the bottle. Ethylene<br>
oxide (EO) migrates through most plastics at the thicknesses used for blow molding<br>
containers (.040" or less) and forms toxic by-products when allowed to react with certain<br>
antiseptic products, most notably chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). Manufacturers have<br>
devised methods to eliminate permeation such as packaging in glass ampoules or by<br>
employing plastics with gas barrier properties such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
PET greatly reduces permeation when a sufficient cross-section is provided in the<br>
package; however the current devices employ blow molded containers in combination<br>
with conventional caps. The caps therefore become the weakest part of these systems and<br>
oftentimes leak due to inconsistent sealings (PET/foil) or due to cap loosening due to the<br>
pressure imparted during the EO sterilization process.<br>
The current devices mentioned above employ either a glass blow or<br>
molded plastic container with a thickness of or less than .030". This minimal thickness<br>
allows for considerable permeation of EO through the wall of the container during<br>
sterilization. Additionally, the current devices use blow-molded containers that during<br>
manufacture are pinched off at the openings or cut via a spindle and knife apparatus. The<br>
result is a sharp, uneven and irregular top surface to the container, which is problematic<br>
when a seal is applied to the non-uniform surface and an irregular seal is formed.<br>
Additionally, current container designs utilize conventional, single weld<br>
innerseals as a means of sealing the bottle contents. The size of the bottle cap and force<br>
with which it is tightened on the bottle therefore becomes critical to maintenance of the<br>
force needed to mechanically reinforce the foil over time. The loosening of the cap is a<br>
common failure and oftentimes results in leakage of the bottle contents - especially when<br>
the system is pressurized or is required to remain in storage for long periods prior to use.<br>
Finally current devices suffer from control of the contained fluid due to<br>
their design. Ampulized applicators rely upon low viscosity fluid of less than 200<br>
centipoise due to the small orifice associated with the ampule after fracture. Fluids of<br>
higher viscosity do not readily flow out of standard ampule designs when inverted.<br>
These lower viscosity fluids however require metering features within the applicator,<br>
especially when smaller (less than 4 sq. in.) sponges are used. Inevitably these lower<br>
viscosity fluids result in loss of fluid control once dispensed to the patient's skin which<br>
poses an unnecessary risk of fire due to the associated pooling of alcohol within surgical<br>
drapes.<br>
Alternate embodiments have attempted to address this issue by adding gel<br>
components into the antiseptic resulting in a 100 fold increase in the viscosity (2,000<br>
centipoise) or higher. These devices suffer an inability of the fluid to migrate to the<br>
sponge dispensing means.<br>
Therefore it would be highly desirable to overcome these disadvantages<br>
relating to fluid control and viscosity with a device that contained an antiseptic that<br>
would flow readily under gravity (400-700 centipoise) thereby eliminating the need for<br>
compression of the handle element in combination with an absorbent member, e.g.,<br>
sponge design, that contained sufficient fluid capacity such that little to no pooling of the<br>
antiseptic fluid would result.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to overcome the disadvantages and<br>
drawbacks of the prior art with a medical skin applicator including a fluid container<br>
having a penetrable surface that is engageable with a piercing member to facilitate fluid<br>
communication with a dispensing member of the skin applicator thereby enabling<br>
preparation and treatment of a skin surface of a patient. It would be desirable if the skin<br>
applicator can be disposed in an inverted orientation during use. Such a skin applicator<br>
may also accommodate multiple combinations of sterilizing agents and applicator head<br>
designs. It would be highly desirable if the medical skin applicator and its constituent<br>
parts are easily and efficiently manufactured and assembled.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, a<br>
medical skin applicator apparatus includes a fluid housing having a fluid chamber for<br>
storing a medical agent, and a penetrable wall to permit access to the fluid chamber and<br>
release of the medical agent therefrom, and an applicator coupled to the fluid housing.<br>
The applicator includes an applicator surface for applying the medical agent to a patient.<br>
The applicator has a penetrating member adapted to penetrate the penetrable wall of the<br>
fluid housing upon achieving a predetermined coupled relation of the fluid housing and<br>
the applicator, to thereby permit the medical agent to be dispensed from the fluid<br>
chamber and applied to the patient with the applicator surface. The fluid housing is<br>
adapted to move relative to the applicator from a first transit position to a second actuated<br>
position to cause penetration of the penetrating member with the penetrable wall and to<br>
establish the predetermined coupled relation thereof.<br>
The fluid housing may include an end cap mounted adjacent the<br>
penetrating wall. The end cap preferably defines an open portal to permit the penetrating<br>
member to pass therethrough and penetrate the penetrable wall of the fluid housing upon<br>
movement of the fluid housing to the second actuated position. The end cap may include<br>
at least one retaining member mounted along an outer surface thereof. The at least one<br>
retaining member is received within a locking recess associated with the applicator upon<br>
movement of the fluid housing to the second actuated position to retain the fluid housing<br>
in the second actuated position. The at least one retaining member includes a locking tab<br>
which is received within a corresponding channel in the dispenser. The locking tab is<br>
adapted to traverse the channel during movement of the fluid housing to the second<br>
actuated position for reception within the locking recess. Additional means for retaining<br>
the fluid housing in the second actuated position is also envisioned.<br>
The applicator may include at least two penetrating members. A first<br>
penetrating member is dimensioned and positioned to penetrate the penetrable wall in a<br>
first location to allow egress of the medical agent from the fluid chamber. A second<br>
penetrating member of the at least two penetrating members is dimensioned and<br>
positioned to penetrate the penetrable wall in a second location spaced from the first<br>
location to allow air ingress to the fluid chamber. In the alternative, the at least two<br>
penetrating members are adapted to divide the penetrable wall into wall portions. The at<br>
least two penetrating members may be coaxially arranged about an axis in spaced<br>
relation. Four penetrating members are provided to divide the penetrable wall into<br>
quadrant portions. In a further alternative, the penetrating member is arranged in an<br>
annular array of, e.g., a plurality of penetrating members to form a substantially annular<br>
opening within the penetrable wall.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, at least one of the fluid housing and the<br>
applicator includes an internal member. The internal member is positioned to engage a<br>
wall portion defined within the opening of the penetrable wall to displace the wall portion<br>
during movement of the fluid housing to the second actuated position. The internal<br>
member is an internal wall within the fluid housing. The internal wall extends in a<br>
general longitudinal direction and is positioned to rotate the wall portion of the penetrable<br>
wall during movement of the fluid housing to the second actuated position thereof.<br>
Preferably, an internal wall is also within the applicator. The internal wall extends in a<br>
general longitudinal direction and within the annular array, and is positioned to cooperate<br>
with the internal wall of the fluid housing to rotate the penetrable wall.<br>
The applicator includes an applicator frame and an absorbent member<br>
mounted to a lower surface of the applicator frame. The applicator includes a relative<br>
enlarged section and a relative narrow prow section depending from the enlarged section.<br>
The prow section includes opposed generally concave surfaces extending to a leading<br>
surface which interconnects the concave surfaces. The leading surface is preferably<br>
arcuate. The enlarged section includes opposed generally convex surfaces extending<br>
from a trailing surface which interconnects the convex surfaces. Alternatively, the<br>
applicator defines a complex curve configuration in plan. The complex curve<br>
configuration includes a pair of opposed generally convex surfaces and a pair of opposed<br>
generally concave surfaces extending contiguously from the convex surfaces to a leading<br>
surface.<br>
The fluid housing is preferably adapted for longitudinal movement to<br>
move from the first transit position to the second actuated position. The fluid housing<br>
may also be adapted for rotational movement relative to the applicator to release the fluid<br>
housing to permit movement thereof toward the second actuated position. One of the<br>
fluid housing and the applicator may include a locking tab and the other of the fluid<br>
housing and the applicator include a locking recess for cooperating with the locking tab<br>
to selectively lock the fluid housing and the applicator in the second actuated position.<br>
An outer housing may be provided for at least partially accommodating<br>
the fluid housing. The outer housing is mountable to the applicator. The fluid housing is<br>
adapted for longitudinal movement within the outer housing. A manually engageable<br>
member is connected to the fluid housing and extends beyond the outer housing. The<br>
manually engageable member is depressible to cause longitudinal movement of the fluid<br>
housing to the second actuated position. The manually engageable member may include<br>
a locking member which is received within a corresponding locking recess in the outer<br>
housing to releasably retain the fluid housing in the first transit position. The locking<br>
member of the manually engageable member may include a deflectable tab. The<br>
deflectable tab is movable from the locking recess to release the manually engageable<br>
member and permit movement of the fluid housing to the second position thereof. Means<br>
for securing the fluid housing in the second position is also provided. In one<br>
arrangement, the outer housing includes a locking recess adapted to receive the<br>
deflectable tab to secure the fluid housing in the second position.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the manually engageable member<br>
includes a locking tab releasably mounted thereto. The locking tab selectively secures<br>
the fluid housing in the first transit position and is removable to permit the manually<br>
engageable member to be advanced to move the fluid housing to the second actuated<br>
position.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the applicator frame of the applicator<br>
includes a conduit for passage of the medical agent from the fluid chamber to the<br>
absorbent member. The applicator frame includes a plurality of channels on the lower<br>
surface thereof in communication with the conduit. The channels are dimensioned to<br>
convey fluid along the lower surface and to the absorbent member. The applicator frame<br>
may include a plurality of arcuate channels defined in the lower surface thereof and in<br>
communication within the conduit for conveying fluid to the absorbent member. At least<br>
two of the arcuate channels are in general concentric arrangement. Alternatively, the<br>
channels of the applicator frame are in intersecting relation. The channels may define a<br>
general grid pattern on the lower surface of the applicator frame. As a further alternative,<br>
the applicator frame includes first and second substantially linear channels in the lower<br>
surface thereof and in intersecting relation, and in communication with the conduit for<br>
conveying fluid to the absorbent member.<br>
The applicator frame preferably includes an enlarged opening extending<br>
through a lower surface thereof and in communication with the conduit. The opening<br>
conveys fluid to the absorbent member. A supplemental channel may be adjacent the<br>
enlarged opening and in communication with the conduit. The supplemental channel<br>
facilitates dispensing of the medical agent. Preferably, first and second supplemental<br>
channels are adjacent forward and rear ends of the applicator frame and in<br>
communication with the conduit for facilitating dispensing of the medical fluid. The first<br>
and/or second channels may serve as vents for release of air captured within the<br>
absorbent member.<br>
The absorbent member may include at least one slit defined therein. The<br>
at least one slit is adapted to assume a substantially open condition upon application of<br>
pressure to the absorbent member to permit passage of the medical agent and assume a<br>
substantially closed condition in the absence of pressure to the absorbent member<br>
substantially preventing the medical agent to pass therethrough. Preferably, the<br>
absorbent member includes a plurality of spaced slits. Alternatively, the absorbent<br>
member includes a recessed channel defined in a lower surface thereof adapted to<br>
facilitate passage of the medical agent therethrough.<br>
The penetrable wall may include one of a metal and a polymeric member<br>
connected to the fluid housing. Preferably, the penetrable wall includes a foil liner which<br>
is attached to the fluid housing. The foil liner may be attached to the fluid housing and to<br>
the end cap.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the outer housing and the fluid housing are<br>
arranged about a first longitudinal axis and the applicator is arranged about a second<br>
longitudinal axis displaced from the first longitudinal axis in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the applicator surface. The first axis of the fluid housing preferably is in general parallel<br>
relation to the second axis of the applicator.<br>
A dye may positioned relative to the fluid housing. The dye contacts the<br>
medical agent upon release of the medical agent from the internal chamber of the fluid<br>
housing. The dye may be stored within the fluid housing in isolated relation from the<br>
medical agent whereby upon movement to the second actuated position, the penetrating<br>
member penetrates the penetrable wall to permit release of the medical agent and contact<br>
thereof with the dye. The fluid housing may include a second penetrable wall distal of<br>
the first-mentioned penetrable wall and having the dye stored therebetween whereby<br>
upon movement of the fluid housing to the second actuated position, the penetrating<br>
member penetrates the first mentioned penetrable wall and the second penetrable wall to<br>
permit respective release of the medical agent and the dye.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a medical skin applicator apparatus<br>
includes a fluid housing defining a longitudinal axis and having a fluid chamber for<br>
storing and selectively releasing a medical agent, and an applicator coupled to the fluid<br>
housing. The applicator includes an applicator surface in fluid communication with the<br>
fluid chamber for applying the medical agent to a patient. The applicator surface defines<br>
a configuration characterized by having a relatively enlarged portion and a relatively<br>
narrowed portion extending from the enlarged portion. The relatively narrowed portion<br>
includes opposed generally concave surfaces extending to a leading surface which<br>
interconnects the concave surfaces. The leading surface may be generally arcuate. The<br>
enlarged section includes opposed generally convex surfaces extending from a trailing<br>
surface which interconnects the convex surfaces. In the alternative, the applicator defines<br>
a complex curve configuration in plan. The complex curve configuration includes a pair<br>
of opposed generally convex surfaces and a pair of opposed generally concave surfaces<br>
extending contiguously from the convex surfaces to a leading surface.<br>
A method of using a medical skin applicator apparatus is also disclosed.<br>
The method includes the steps of providing an applicator having a fluid housing that<br>
defines a fluid chamber and an applicator member for dispensing the fluid and actuating<br>
the applicator with a single hand to facilitate fluid communication between the chamber<br>
and the applicator member.<br>

enabling preparation and treatment of a skin surface of a patient. It is envisioned that the<br>
skin applicator apparatus may be employed in a range of medical procedures, such as, for<br>
example, surgical, diagnostic and related treatments of diseases and body ailments of a<br>
subject. It is further envisioned that the principles relating to the skin applicator<br>
apparatus disclosed include application of various agents to a body, such as, for example,<br>
medications and other fluids.<br>
In the discussion that follows, the term "proximal" will refer to the portion<br>
of a structure that is closer to a practitioner, while the term "distal" will refer to the<br>
portion that is further from the practitioner or user. As used herein, the term "subject"<br>
refers to a human patient or other animal. According to the present disclosure, the term<br>
"practitioner" or "user" refers typically to a doctor, nurse or other care provider and may<br>
include support personnel.<br>
The following discussion includes descriptions of the various<br>
embodiments of the skin applicator apparatus in accordance with the principles of the<br>
present disclosure followed by a description of uses of the apparatus.<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein like components are designated by<br>
like references throughout the several views, FIGS. 1-3, in conjunction with the crosssectional<br>
view of FIG. 4, illustrate the medical skin applicator apparatus in accordance<br>
with the principle of the present disclosure. Apparatus 100 includes two main<br>
assemblies, namely, fluid container assembly 102 and applicator head assembly 104<br>
which is connected to the fluid container assembly 102. In general, fluid container<br>
assembly 102 is adapted for movement relative to applicator head assembly 104 from a<br>
first transit position to a second actuated position to dispense a medical agent or fluid for<br>
18<br>
application to a patient. Fluid container assembly 102 includes fluid housing 106<br>
defining housing axis "x", and end cap 108 which is releasably mountable to the fluid<br>
housing 106. Fluid housing 106 defines internal chamber 106a (FIG. 4) which is filled<br>
with a medicant, cleaning solution or the like. Such medicants are inclusive of antiseptic<br>
solutions, sterilizing solutions, etc., in liquid or in gel form. One suitable sterilization<br>
fluid is the sterilized liquid made under the tradename, Excel-AP, manufactured by<br>
Aplicare, Branford CT. This liquid is comprised of 7.5 % w/w available Iodine, 64.5%<br>
w/w Isopropanol and 25.3% USP sterile water among other proprietary ingredients.<br>
Fluid housing 106 further defines handle section 110, cylindrical section<br>
112 disposed distal of the handle section 110 and nipple section 114. Handle section 110<br>
has a scalloped undersurface for facilitating gripping engagement by the user,<br>
specifically, with a single hand of the user. Cylindrical section 112 includes outer<br>
circumferential rib 116 defined at the juncture of the cylindrical section 112 and handle<br>
section 110. Circumferential 116 serves as a stop to properly position fluid container<br>
assembly 102 relative to applicator head assembly 104 upon actuation of apparatus 100.<br>
Nipple section 114 incorporates external thread 118.<br>
Fluid housing 106, particularly, handle section 110, may be fabricated<br>
from a suitable flexible material to permit the handle section 110 to be compressed to<br>
expel the fluid. In one preferred embodiment, fluid housing 106 is fabricated from a<br>
suitable polymeric material such as polypropylene and is manufactured via conventional<br>
injection molding techniques. Other elastomeric materials are also envisioned.<br>
Fluid housing 106 also includes a penetrable wall or surface in the form<br>
of, e.g., seal or liner 120, connected to the distal end surface of nipple section 114. Liner<br>
120 may be a metallic or a polymeric material, and is attached to fluid housing 106<br>
subsequent to filling the housing 106 with the medical liquid. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, liner 120 is a foil liner which is induction sealed to nipple 114 of fluid<br>
housing 106. In the alternative, liner 120 may be secured within end cap 108 and adapted<br>
to seal nipple 114 when the end cap 108 is mounted to fluid housing 106. Liner 120 may<br>
also be a double ply liner with one ply attached to end cap 108 and the other ply attached<br>
to nipple 114. In the alternative, liner 120 may be a spin welded plastic cap having a thin<br>
wall which is joined to nipple 114 via a spin weld or the like. A plastic cap may be<br>
required with antiseptic solutions containing alcohol. The plastic cap may have a<br>
selected notched geometry that provides a fracture point for the sharp point of the<br>
penetrating member to reduce the required puncture bore. Upon actuation of apparatus<br>
100, liner 120 is punctured to permit release of the medical agent or liquid from fluid<br>
housing 106.<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 4 - 5, in conjunction with FIG. 2, end cap<br>
108 of fluid container assembly 102 will be discussed. End cap 108 is generally<br>
cylindrical in configuration and defines outer wall 122 and annular flange 124 disposed at<br>
the distal end of the outer wall in transverse relation to housing axis "x". Outer wall 122<br>
incorporates a pair of axial guide ribs 126 disposed in diametrically opposed relation and<br>
extending along the axis "x" of fluid housing 106. Guide ribs 126 orient end cap 108 at a<br>
predetermined rotational position relative to applicator head assembly 104 and/or prevent<br>
the end cap 108 from rotating within applicator head assembly 104 upon assembly.<br>
Outer wall 122 of end cap 108 further possesses a pair of locking tabs 128 arranged in<br>
diametrical opposed relation approximately 90° displaced from guide ribs 126. Locking<br>
tabs 128 are each in the shape of a baseball plate having a leading v-shaped head with<br>
angled side surfaces 130 and transverse surface 132 contiguously extending from the vshaped<br>
head. Locking tabs 128 secure fluid container assembly 102 in the second<br>
actuated position.<br>
Annular flange 124 of end cap 108 defines central opening 132 which<br>
permits access to liner 120 attached to fluid housing 106. Annual flange 124 has<br>
peripheral rib 134 disposed about the periphery of the flange 124. Peripheral rib 134<br>
extends a predetermined distance along the housing axis "x" and cooperates with<br>
corresponding structure within applicator head assembly 102 to form a fluid tight seal<br>
within apparatus 100 when the apparatus 100 is actuated. End cap 108 further defines<br>
internal thread 136. Internal thread 136 cooperates with external thread 118 of fluid<br>
housing 106 to mount the end cap 108 to the fluid housing 106.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, and the enlarged views of FIGS. 6-7,<br>
applicator head assembly 104 will be discussed. Applicator head assembly 104 includes<br>
applicator frame 138 and applicator member 140 (in the form of an absorbent member)<br>
which is mounted to the applicator frame 138. Applicator frame 138 incorporates<br>
housing support collar 142 at is proximal end and cap support collar 144 disposed distal<br>
of the housing support collar 142. Housing support collar 142 defines an internal cavity<br>
having a diameter which approximates the diameter of cylindrical section 112 of fluid<br>
housing 106 to receive the cylindrical section 112 during assembly. Similarly, cap<br>
support collar 144 defines an internal diameter or dimension which corresponds to the<br>
diameter of end cap 108. As depicted in FIGS. 6-7, cap support collar 144 further<br>
includes at least one, preferably, a pair of diametrically opposed axial channels 146<br>
extending completely through its outer wall and longitudinal relief slots 148 on opposed<br>
sides of each axial channel 146. Axial channel 146 is defined by opposed cam surfaces<br>
which extend in oblique relation to the housing axis "x" and terminate in locking<br>
recess 152. Axial channels 146 receive locking tabs 128 of end cap 108 and permit the<br>
locking tabs 128 to traverse the channels 146 during actuation of apparatus 10. The<br>
functionality of axial channels 146 and longitudinal slots 148 will be discussed in greater<br>
detail hereinbelow.<br>
As best depicted in FIG. 7, cap support collar 144 further defines internal<br>
longitudinal grooves 154. Internal grooves 154 receive axial guide ribs 126 of end cap<br>
108, which traverse the internal grooves 154 during actuation of the apparatus 108.<br>
Internal grooves 154 and axial guide ribs rotatably fix fluid container assembly 102<br>
within applicator head assembly 104. Cap support collar 144 further defines annual<br>
groove 156 within the internal cavity of the support collar 144. Annual groove 156 is<br>
arranged in opposed relation to peripheral rib 134 of end cap 108 to receive the peripheral<br>
rib 134 during actuation of apparatus 100. Annular groove 156 and peripheral rib 134 are<br>
appropriately dimensioned to form a seal within the internal cavity of cap support collar<br>
144 during actuation of the apparatus to substantially minimize migration of fluids back<br>
toward fluid housing 106.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8, applicator frame 138 further defines a pair of<br>
piercing members or spikes 158 disposed within the interior of cap support collar 144.<br>
Piercing members 158 define sharpened tips which penetrate liner 120 during actuation<br>
of apparatus 100. Piercing members 158 are preferably spaced as shown. Two piercing<br>
members 158 are shown, however, it is appreciated that more or less than two piercing<br>
members 158 may be provided and still achieve the objectives of the present disclosure.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 8-9, applicator frame 138 further includes throat<br>
160 and applicator support plate 162 extending from the throat 160. Throat 160 defines<br>
internal bore 160b through which the medical agent or fluid released from fluid housing<br>
106 flows to applicator member 140. Applicator support plate 162 supports applicator<br>
member 140. Support plate 162 includes central aperture 164 which is in communication<br>
with internal bore 160a of throat 160 and first and second channels 166, 168 disposed on<br>
the lower surface of the support plate (FIG. 9). Central aperture 164 is dimensioned to<br>
permit a relatively large volume of the medical agent or fluid to be dispersed therefrom<br>
and communicated through first and second channels 166, 168. First channel 166<br>
extends in a general longitudinal direction and second channel 168 extends in transverse<br>
relation to the first channel 166. First channel 166 defines an enlarged width relative to<br>
second channel 168 and permits a sufficient volume of medical fluid to communicate<br>
with the extreme outer portions, i.e., the leading and trailing ends of, applicator frame<br>
138. Applicator frame 138 may further define a plurality of radial or arcuate grooves 170<br>
generally arranged in the concentric relation shown. Arcuate grooves 170 are in fluid<br>
communication with first and second channels 166, 168. Arcuate grooves 170 distribute<br>
the medical agent to substantially the entire surface of support plate 160 for delivery to<br>
applicator member 140. In this regard, the medical agent is uniformly applied to<br>
applicator member 140 through the fluid manifold defined within support plate 162<br>
inclusive of first and second channels 166, 168, arcuate grooves 170 and central aperture<br>
164, which consequently results in uniform application to the patient.<br>
Applicator member 140 is mounted to support plate 162. Applicator<br>
member 140 preferably includes an absorbent member in the form of an open cell,<br>
reticulated urethane foam, 75 +/- 10 pores/inch (ppi). Applicator member 140 may be<br>
adhered to support plate 160 with adhesives, welding or the like. Applicator member 140<br>
is configured for transmission of the medical agent dispensed from fluid container<br>
assembly 102. The volume of absorbent member of applicator member 140 is<br>
proportioned to contain the full contents of the fluid container thereby acting as a fluid<br>
reservoir during application to the patient's skin. This capacity is used to control fluid<br>
release and minimize pooling of the antiseptic on the patient's skin.<br>
As best depicted in FIG. 10 applicator member 140 defines a general teardrop<br>
shaped or dolphin nosed configuration when viewed in plan. In particular, support<br>
plate 160 and applicator member 140 define an enlarged section 172 and an elongated<br>
neck or prow section 174 depending from the enlarged section 172. Enlarged section 17?<br>
is envisioned to facilitate application of medical fluid to relatively large body areas.<br>
Elongated neck section 174 is dimensioned to be-positioned in narrow remote areas such<br>
as the patient's fingers, toes, eye area etc. or in areas where only a relatively small<br>
amount of fluid is needed. Enlarged section 172 includes opposed generally convex<br>
surfaces 176 interconnected by arcuate trailing surface 178. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, enlarged section 172 defines a partial ellipse having a maximum width "w"<br>
of about 2 inches to about 4 inches. Elongated neck or prow section 174 defines opposed<br>
concave surfaces 180 extending contiguously from convex surfaces 176 of enlarged<br>
section 172, which lead to leading arcuate surface 182 interconnecting the concave<br>
surfaces 180. The arcuate configuration of concave surfaces 180 facilitates manipulation<br>
of apparatus 100 about the fingers, toes, etc. of the patient. In particular, the curvature of<br>
concave services 180 generally conforms to the curvature of various parts of the anatomy<br>
whereby applicator member 140 can be applied to the body with the concave services 180<br>
being rolled and pivoted in relation to the anatomical body part. Prow section 174<br>
defines a minimum width "W2"of about 0.5 inches to about 1.5 inches. Absorbent<br>
applicator member 140 defines a length "1" ranging from about 3 inches to about 6<br>
inches.<br>
The operation of apparatus 100 now be discussed. In use, the practitioner<br>
grasps applicator 100 with a single hand by anchoring his or her last three digits to an<br>
underside of fluid housing 106. The thumb is then placed across the top of applicator<br>
frame 138 to grasp the frame 138. The index finger is anchored relative to applicator<br>
frame 138, and then both thumb and index finger are simultaneously pulled toward the<br>
anchored fingers to generate a predetermined joining force between fluid container<br>
assembly 102 and applicator housing assembly 104. Fluid housing assembly 102 is thus<br>
caused to move relative to applicator head assembly 104 in a longitudinal direction, as<br>
depicted by the directional arrow "z" in FIG. 11 to its second actuated position. The<br>
range of longitudinal movement may be limited by engagement of circumferential stop or<br>
rib 116 with housing supported collar 142.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 12, during axial movement of fluid housing 106,<br>
locking tabs 132 of end cap 108 traverse axial channels 146 of applicator frame 138. As<br>
noted, longitudinal relief slots 148 adjacent axial channels 146 permits cam surfaces 150<br>
(which define axial channels 146) to deflect outwardly through the camming engagement<br>
with angled side surfaces 130 of locking tabs 128 whereby the locking tabs 128 are<br>
received within locking recesses 152. As appreciated, cam surfaces 150 provide a degree<br>
of resistance to movement of locking tabs 128 through axial channels 146. This<br>
resistance provides a tactile indicator to the practitioner of the condition of apparatus 100<br>
thereby minimizing the potential of inadvertent actuation of the apparatus 100. With<br>
locking tabs 128 received within locking recesses 152, the fluid container assembly 102<br>
is retained in a second actuated position shown in FIGS. 11-13. Simultaneously with the<br>
relative advancement fluid housing assembly 102, piercing members 158 of applicator<br>
head assembly 104 penetrate liner 120 as depicted in FIG. 13. It is also noted that in the<br>
second actuated position, peripheral rib 134 is received within recess 156 (see FIG. 7) to<br>
form a substantial fluid tight seal of this location thereby minimizing fluid back toward<br>
fluid housing 106.<br>
Piercing members 158 may be arranged to completely cover liner 120.<br>
Alternately piercing member 158 are arranged to puncture two holes in liner 120 as<br>
depicted in FIG. 14. The two openings Oi,O2 produced by this action produce fluid<br>
channels, one for the antiseptic solution to spill into throat of applicator frame 136 under<br>
pressure generated by moderate compression of fluid housing 106 by the practitioner.<br>
Second opening 62 facilitates fluid disbursement by allowing air to enter fluid housing<br>
106, thereby equilibrating the internals thereof, preventing vapor lock of the container<br>
contents, and providing a more consistent release of fluid. The above assembly position<br>
is defined as a second or "actuated" position.<br>
Fluid contained within the fluid housing 106 is allowed to flow into<br>
applicator frame 138 immediately after rupture of liner 120. A moderate compression of<br>
fluid housing 106 allows for a portion of the contents therein to be evacuated, whereupon<br>
release of compression allows for air to replace the contents within fluid housing 106.<br>
Allowing for air ingress in this manner speeds fluid flow. In this way, fluid can be<br>
metered or pumped out, and within two to three pumps the entire contents of<br>
approximately 60 ml is expelled from fluid housing 106.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 8-9, the fluid migrates to the applicator support<br>
plate 162 and is distributed through central apparatus 164 and first and second channels<br>
166, 168 and arcuate channels 170. A gentle compression of fluid housing 106 may force<br>
the antiseptic downward into the pores of absorbent member, e.g. The arrangement of<br>
applicator plate 162 allows for transfer of the entire container contents to absorbent<br>
member 142 in approximately two to three seconds, i.e., almost instant fluid fill and<br>
equilibration, thereby allowing uniform wetting over the sponge's non-symmetrical<br>
profile.<br>
In use, the multi-contoured absorbent member 140 conforms to<br>
substantially all body contours or topology of a patient. For example, prow shaped nose,<br>
facilitates propping of eyes, ears, fingers, toes, groin, or other confined topology.<br>
Additionally, the contoured or section conforms to the radial surface of an arm or leg of a<br>
subject. The extended footprint length L (i.e., longer sponge interface) of applicator 70<br>
allows for about four times the coverage in a single stroke by using a side to side motion,<br>
as compared with the prior art. This translates into about a four hundred percent increase<br>
in productivity over prior art applicators having flatter contours, which saves prepping<br>
time and effort, particularly during turnover involving multiple surgeries.<br>
As described above, applicator apparatus 100 of the present disclosure<br>
includes key features and advantages not found in the prior art. The single-handed<br>
triggering mechanism and single-handed activation improves ease and productivity ~<br>
there is no snap ring to deal with or pre-triggering mechanism necessary, and there are no<br>
other parts that require removal prior to use. Instead, a smooth activation, single snap<br>
triggering mechanism is employed. The minimum number of parts reduces complexity<br>
and manufacturing cost. In addition, fluid housing 106 permits for faster wetting, and the<br>
integrated fluid manifold within the applicator frame 138 allows for uniform wetting and<br>
balanced fill of any sponge configuration regardless of fluid viscosity. The larger sponge<br>
consequently allows for inverted use of applicator, faster prep and controlled fluid<br>
release. The contoured multi-use sponge may conform to any patient topology, and the<br>
integrated sponge stick/prow provides the dexterity of a conventional sponge stick with<br>
the speed of an applicator.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 15-18, another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present disclosure is illustrated. Skin applicator apparatus 200 includes fluid container<br>
assembly 202 and applicator head assembly 204 mounted to the fluid housing assembly<br>
202. Fluid container assembly 202 includes fluid housing 206 and collar 208<br>
contiguously extending from the fluid housing 206. Fluid housing 206 is preferably in<br>
the shape of a dome and may incorporate an accordion like configuration to permit the<br>
housing 206 to be compressed to expel the fluid contained therein. It is envisioned that<br>
fluid housing 206 may have various configurations, such as, for example, cylindrical,<br>
rectangular, elliptical, polygon oh, etc., according to requirements of a particular<br>
application. Fluid housing 206 may be formed of an elastomeric material or any of the<br>
materials defined hereinabove. Fluid container assembly 202 further includes liner 210<br>
and end cap 212 which is mounted to collar 208 of fluid housing 206. Liner 210 is<br>
preferably in the form of a foil seal and may be adhered to collar 208 and/or within the<br>
interior of end cap 212.<br>
As best depicted in FIG. 19, end cap 212 is devoid of threads and may be<br>
secured to collar 208 with adhesives, welding, cements, or the like. End cap 212 includes<br>
a pair of diametrically opposed locking tabs 214 on its outer surface, preferably, about<br>
180° apart, and axial ribs 216. Locking tabs and axial ribs 216 function in a similar<br>
manner to the locking tabs and axial ribs of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-14.<br>
With reference to FIGS 16-18, applicator head assembly 204 includes<br>
applicator frame 218 having throat 220 and applicator support plate 222 connected to the<br>
throat 220. Throat 220 defines internal opening 224 which permits passage of the<br>
medical agent to support plate 222 and has proximal flange 226 which is advantageously<br>
dimension to be grasped by the fingers of the practitioner. A pair of axial channels 228<br>
with corresponding longitudinal relief slots 230 extends within the walls of throat 220.<br>
Axial channels 228 receive locking tabs 214 and permit the locking tabs 214 to traverse<br>
the channels 228 during actuation of the instrument. Throat 220 has penetrating spike or<br>
member 230 extending upwardly from applicator supporting plate 222 with internal<br>
opening 224. Spike 230 is shown as a single conically shaped element, however spike<br>
230 can assume any sharpened configuration or may be multiple in number.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 18 and 20, applicator support plate 222 includes a<br>
plurality of apertures 232 in communication with internal opening 224 of throat 220, and<br>
centrally disposed within the center of applicator plate 222. On its lower surface,<br>
applicator support plate 222 includes first and second linear channels 230, 232 in general<br>
transverse relation to each other and centrally located along the major and minor axes<br>
"y", "z" of the support plate 222. Applicator support plate 222 further includes a grid-<br>
type arrangement having a plurality of narrow intersecting channels 234 on its lowest<br>
surface and intersecting linear channels 230, 232.<br>
In use, fluid container assembly 202 is moved from the first transit<br>
position of FIG. 17 to the second actuated position of FIG. 20. Preferably, the<br>
practitioner grabs flange 226 of applicator frame 218 with the index and middle finger<br>
and positions the palm of his hand against the upper surface of fluid housing 206. During<br>
this movement, locking tabs 214 traverse axial channels 228 and are secured within the<br>
locking recesses 228a of the axial channels 228 in a manner similar to that described<br>
hereinabove. Concurrently therewith, penetrating member 230 pierces liner 210 to<br>
permit expulsion of the fluid contained within fluid housing 206. The fluid then<br>
communicates through internal opening 224 of throat 220 and apertures 232. The fluid<br>
agent then communicates through linear channels 230, 232, and further through the grid<br>
type arrangement 234 provided on the lower surface of applicator frame 218. With this<br>
arrangement substantially the entire absorbent member 236 is saturated with the medical<br>
agent. Apparatus 200 is then utilized to apply the medical agent to the skin of the patient.<br>
Fluid housing 206 may be compressed to facilitate expulsion of the fluid agent or the<br>
agent may be gravity fed by inverting the fluid housing 206.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 22-24, an alternate embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure is illustrated. This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment of<br>
FIG.l. However, in accordance with this embodiment, skin applicator apparatus 300<br>
includes fluid housing 302 having a pair of diametrically opposed locking ribs 304<br>
disposed on the exterior surface of cylindrical section 306. Locking ribs 304 are<br>
generally linear in configuration and possess enlarged arcuate rib sections 304a at its<br>
distal end. Applicator frame 306 incorporates collar 308 having locking channels 310<br>
generally corresponding in shape and position to locking ribs 304 of fluid housing 302.<br>
Specifically, locking channels 310 are substantially linear and include first and second<br>
arcuate channel sections 310a, 31 Ob. In the first transit position of fluid housing 302<br>
shown in FIG. 22, each enlarged arcuate rib section 304a of locking ribs 304 resides<br>
within first arcuate channel section 31 Oa of locking channel 310 and is confined therein<br>
through the inner boundary of the channel section 310a thus releasably securing fluid<br>
housing 302 in the first transit position. When it is decided to actuate the apparatus 300,<br>
the practitioner advances fluid housing 302 relative to applicator frame 306. During this<br>
movement, locking ribs 304 traverse locking channels 310 whereby the surfaces defining<br>
the locking channels 310 deflect outwardly to permit passage of the enlarged rib section<br>
304a and reception thereof within second arcuate channel section 31 Ob in snap relation<br>
therewith. In this position, locking ribs 304 are secured within locking channels 310<br>
thereby securing the fluid housing 302 in the second actuated position of FIG. 24. In all<br>
other respects, apparatus 300 is similar in function to apparatus 100 of FIG. 1.<br>
FIGS. 25-28 illustrate another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure. Skin applicator apparatus 400 is generally similar to apparatus 200 described<br>
in connection with the embodiment of FIGS. 15. However, in accordance with this<br>
embodiment, fluid housing 402 includes at least one or a pair of diametrically opposed<br>
locking tabs 404 on distal collar 406. In this embodiment, apparatus 200 is devoid of an<br>
end cap; however, it is envisioned that apparatus 200 may have an end cap with the<br>
aforedescribed locking tabs 404. Locking tabs 404 are received within corresponding<br>
generally z- shaped slots 408 defined in throat 410 of applicator frame 412. Z-shaped<br>
slot 408 is characterized by having a first vertical section 414, a horizontal section 416<br>
and a second vertical section 418 extending from the horizontal section 416. Vertical<br>
section 414, 418 includes locking recesses 420, 422. A longitudinal relief slot 424 is<br>
disposed adjacent each vertical section 414, 418 of z-shaped slots 408. Relief slots 424<br>
permit outward deflection of the wall surfaces defining vertical sections 414, 418 to<br>
permit locking tabs 404 to be received within locking recesses 420, 422. In use, collar<br>
406 of fluid housing 402 is positioned within throat 410 of applicator frame 412 with<br>
locking tabs 404 positioned within vertical section 414 of z-shaped slots 408 and received<br>
within locking recess 420. In this position, fluid housing 402 is retained within applicator<br>
frame 412 and releasably secured in the first transit position through cooperation of tabs<br>
404 with the wall surfaces defining locking recesses 420. When it is decided to actuate<br>
apparatus 400, the practitioner rotates fluid housing 402 in the direction of directional<br>
arrow "a" relative to applicator frame 412 as shown in FIG. 27. Locking tabs 404 are<br>
forced from locking recesses 420 whereby relief slots 424 permit the surfaces defining<br>
locking recesses 420 to deflect in an outward direction. The force required to displace<br>
locking tabs 404 from locking recesses 420 provides a tactile indicator to the practitioner<br>
of the movement of fluid housing 402 toward the second actuated position. Locking tabs<br>
404 traverse horizontal sections 416 of the z-shaped slot 408 to a position in alignment<br>
with second vertical section 418, shown in FIG. 27. Thereafter, the practitioner applies a<br>
distal force to fluid housing 402 to cause the fluid housing 402 to advance relative to<br>
applicator frame 412 to the position depicted in FIG. 28. During this movement, locking<br>
tabs 404 traverse second vertical section 418 of the shaped slot 408 and are received<br>
within the locking recesses 422. As appreciated, during this movement wall surfaces<br>
defining vertical section 418 are permitted to deflect outwardly by provision of<br>
longitudinal relief slots 424 to permit locking tabs 404 to be received within locking<br>
recesses 422. Locking recesses 422 thus retain locking tabs 404 to thereby retain fluid<br>
housing 402 in its second actuated position dispensing the medical agent into absorbent<br>
member 426.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 29-31, there is illustrated another alternative<br>
embodiment of the skin applicator apparatus of the present disclosure. Skin applicator<br>
apparatus 500 includes fluid container assembly 502 and applicator head assembly 504<br>
connected to the fluid container assembly 502. Fluid container assembly 502 includes<br>
fluid housing 506, end cap 508 connected to the housing 506 and liner 510. Fluid<br>
housing 506 includes at least one cylindrical locking protrusion 512 or, alternatively, a<br>
pair of locking protrusions 512 which extends radially outwardly relative to housing axis<br>
"x", and circumferential rib 514 distal of the locking protrusion(s) 512. Fluid housing<br>
506 further includes external thread 516 at its distal end and a plurality of radially spaced<br>
wings 518 extending outwardly from the wall of fluid housing 506 proximal of thread<br>
516. Liner 510 is preferably a foil liner, and may be secured to fluid housing 506 through<br>
any of the afore-mentioned means. End cap 508 includes internal thread 520 which<br>
cooperates with external thread 516 of fluid housing 506 to secure the end cap 508 onto<br>
the fluid housing 506 (FIG. 33). End cap 508 further includes a plurality of angled teeth<br>
519 at the mouth of the end cap (FIG. 31 and FIG. 35). In the secured position, radially<br>
spaced wings 518 on the exterior surface of fluid housing 506 engage or bite into the<br>
angled teeth 519 of end cap 508 to prevent the end cap 508 from inadvertent removal<br>
from the fluid housing 506 (FIG. 35). End cap 508 further defines a distal collar section<br>
508c having a reduced diameter - the function of which will be discussed in greater detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
Referring again to FIGS. 30-32, fluid container assembly 502 further<br>
includes housing extension 522 which is connected to fluid housing 506. In one<br>
preferred method of attachment, housing extension 522 includes a pair of cylindrical<br>
openings 524 through its wall for reception of locking protrusions 512 of fluid housing<br>
506 in snap relation therewith. Other means for connecting housing extension 522 to<br>
fluid housing 506 are also envisioned. Housing extension 522 further includes locking<br>
lever 526 in its outer wall. Locking lever 526 is adapted to releasably retain fluid<br>
housing 506 in the first unactuated position. Locking lever 526 defines locking shelf 528<br>
and is adapted to deflect radially inwardly along its living hinge to release the locking<br>
shelf 528 as will be discussed. Housing extension 522 further defines manually<br>
engageable button 530 at its proximal end. Button 530 defines a reduced diameter<br>
relative to the remaining portion of housing extension 522 and has a rail 532 extending in<br>
an axial direction along its outer surface. Rail 532 ensures a single alignment position to<br>
facilitate assembly.<br>
Skin applicator apparatus 500 further includes outer housing 534. Outer<br>
housing 534 is secured to applicator head assembly 504 and is dimensioned to<br>
accommodate fluid housing 506 and housing extension 522. Outer housing 534 defines a<br>
contoured configuration having a plurality of spaced ribs 536 on its outer surface to<br>
facilitate gripping engagement by the practitioner. Outer housing 534 defines central<br>
aperture 538 at its proximal end which receives manually engageable button 530 of<br>
housing extension 522, and keyed opening 540 for receiving rail 532 of the housing<br>
extension 522 (FIG. 31). With this relationship, housing extension 522 is adapted to<br>
move in a general longitudinal direction relative to outer housing 534, but, is rotatably<br>
fixed relative to the outer housing 534.<br>
Outer housing 534 further defines opening 542 (FIG. 31) in its outer wall<br>
for at least partially accommodating locking lever 526 of housing extension 522.<br>
Opening 542 defines distal locking surface 544 which is engaged by locking shelf 528 of<br>
locking lever 526 of housing extension 522 when in the first transit position of fluid<br>
housing 506 (FIG. 32). Outer housing 534 incorporates release lever 546 which extends<br>
within opening 542 of the outer housing 534 in superposed relation to locking lever 526<br>
of housing extension 522. Release lever 546 pivots radially inwardly about its living<br>
hinge to engage and cause corresponding pivotal movement of locking lever 526 to<br>
release locking shelf 528 from its engagement with locking surface 544. In this<br>
orientation, housing extension 522 and fluid housing 506 are permitted to move in a<br>
longitudinal direction to the second actuated position.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 33 and 36-38, applicator head assembly 504 will<br>
be discussed. Applicator head assembly 504 includes applicator frame 548 and absorbent<br>
applicator member 550 attached to the applicator frame 548. Applicator frame 548<br>
includes throat 552 defining an internal bore for reception of end cap 508 and fluid<br>
housing 506. Throat 552 has at least one opening 552a (FIG. 31) in its outer wall for<br>
accommodating a correspqnding locking projection 554 of outer housing 534 to fixedly<br>
secure applicator frame 548 to the outer housing 534.<br>
As best depicted in FIGS. 33, 36-37, within the interior of throat 552 is<br>
internal collar 556 mounted to transverse wall 557, and a plurality of penetrating<br>
members 558 extending from the internal collar 556. Penetrating members 558 are<br>
preferably four in number and are arranged along intersecting planes to define four<br>
quadrants when the penetrating members 558 pierce liner 510. More or less than four<br>
penetrating members 558 are also envisioned. Specifically, each penetrating member 558<br>
extends to a point 560 with each of the points 560 of the penetrating members 558 being<br>
disposed about a central axis "c" in adjacent spaced relation as shown.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 36-38, applicator frame 548 further defines first<br>
and second channels 562, 564 disposed about the periphery of internal collar 556 adjacent<br>
upper and lower areas of throat 552. First and second channels or manifolds 562,564<br>
facilitate passage of the medical agent or fluid directly to the leading and trailing ends,<br>
respectively, of applicator member 550. First channel 562 is generally semicircular in<br>
cross-section and extends from semicircular passage 562a adjacent the periphery of<br>
internal collar 556 to the upper or forward end of applicator frame 548. Second channel<br>
564 extends from an arcuate or crescent shape opening 564a within transverse wall 557<br>
and is in communication with the lower or rear end of applicator frame 548. Applicator<br>
frame 548 further defines central enlarged orifice 566 which extends to the lower surface<br>
of applicator frame 548. Orifice 566 is in fluid communication with first and second<br>
channels 562, 564, and is sized to expel a substantial volume of fluid onto the central area<br>
of absorbent member 550.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 36 and 39, absorbent member 550 is substantially<br>
similar in shape to the absorbent members discussed hereinabove and is preferably in the<br>
form of an absorbent sponge, foam, etc. Absorbent member 550 is mounted to the lower<br>
surface of applicator frame 548 via conventional means. Absorbent member 550<br>
includes a plurality of spaced slits 568 which extend completely through the thickness of<br>
the absorbent member 550 along the central axis of absorbent member 550. Slits 568<br>
function as zero closure valves, i.e. the slits 568 are adapted to remain closed in the<br>
absence of pressure to absorbent member 550 but will open when pressure is applied to<br>
the absorbent member 550 to permit the fluid to flow therethrough.<br>
In use, the practitioner grabs apparatus 500 with a single hand preferably<br>
about outer housing 534. Thereafter, to activate apparatus 500, the practitioner engages<br>
release lever 546 of outer housing 534 and depresses the release lever 546 in a radially<br>
inward direction "i" as depicted in FIG. 32. Release lever 546 pivots about its living<br>
hinge to engage locking lever 526 of housing extension 522 to cause corresponding<br>
inward movement of the locking lever 526. As locking lever 526 pivots inwardly,<br>
locking shelf 528 of locking lever 526 is released from its engagement with locking<br>
surface 544 of outer housing 534. In this position, housing extension 522 and fluid<br>
housing 506 are free to move in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 40, the practitioner thereafter advances button 530<br>
at the proximal end of housing extension 522 with the heel of his hand or, alternatively,<br>
with the thumb of the practitioner. The activation force required (approximately 8-12 Ibs<br>
makes it possible to thumb activate if desired) to advance housing extension 522 and<br>
fluid housing 506 in a distal direction relative to outer housing 534 and applicator head<br>
assembly 504 (FIG. 41). With particular reference now to FIG. 42-43, distal direction of<br>
fluid housing 506 causes liner 510 to be penetrated by the four penetrating members 558<br>
which results in the liner 510 being pierced into four quadrants portions 510 a-d. The<br>
stroke involved allows the foil to be stripped over the sidewall of the piercing cylinder<br>
thereby providing the full diameter for fluid flow. Upon rupture of liner 510, the medical<br>
agent within fluid housing 506 is expelled almost instantaneously through internal bore of<br>
internal collar 556 and into first and second channels 562, 564 for dispensing within<br>
enlarged orifice 566 of applicator frame 548. Enlarged orifice 566 is of substantial<br>
dimension such that the cohesive force associated with the medical agent is overcome by<br>
the mass of the fluid. This allows the fluid to "tumble out" in seconds via gravitational<br>
forces, i.e., no compression of the fluid housing is necessary. In addition, first channel<br>
562 directs fluid to the elongated neck section of applicator member and second channel<br>
564 directs fluid to the rear area. In this manner, a uniform layer of fluid is distributed to<br>
me absorbent member 550. Furthermore, first and/or second channels 562, 564 may<br>
establish an equilibrium within applicator frame 548 by permitting air to pass within the<br>
interior of applicator frame 548 thus ensuring a sufficient flow of the medical agent.<br>
Preferably, either or both of first and second channels 562, 564 may provide a vent<br>
permitting the air displaced during compression of absorbent member 550 to be directed<br>
back through channels 562, 564 through respective openings or passages 562a, 564a and<br>
into applicator frame 548 for venting to the atmosphere. FIG. 33 illustrates the manner in<br>
which first channel 562 extends through passage 562a about collar 556 and<br>
communicates with the interior of applicator frame 548. The assembly tolerance<br>
associated with the components of apparatus 500 is sufficient to permit the air to vent.<br>
Furthermore, in the actuated position, distal collar 508c of end cap 508 hermetically seals<br>
about the outer surface of internal collar 556 to prevent leakage toward the proximal end<br>
of the applicator frame (see FIG. 41). This arrangement may also serve as a friction fit or<br>
interference fit which retains fluid housing in the second actuated position. A volume of<br>
medical agent may pass back through passage 562a or opening 564a of transverse wall<br>
557 during compression of absorbent member 550 to accommodate volumetric<br>
displacement of the fluid. It is further noted that fluid housing 506 may be retained in the<br>
second actuation position by engagement of locking shield 528 of locking lever 526 with<br>
a corresponding position locking aperture 570 within the outer wall of outer housing 534<br>
(see e.g., FIG. 40).<br>
As described above, the applicator apparatus of the present disclosure<br>
includes key features and advantages not found in the prior art. Whereas the prior art<br>
requires two-handed use and high force activation, the present disclosure provides singlehanded<br>
triggering and light activation pressure similar to activating a click-pen. This<br>
results in less hand fatigue and no "smacking" is required. Neither a snap ring nor a high<br>
activation force is required to prevent misfire, and no parts require removal prior to use.<br>
Instead, a single step, squeeze-to-release shipping lock prevents unintended activation,<br>
and the minimum number of parts reduces complexity and manufacturing cost. In<br>
addition, prior art applicator handles are smooth, straight, and angled at 45 degrees,<br>
resulting in limited comfort and control. In contrast, the ergonomic handle of the present<br>
disclosure is ribbed for comfort and traction even when wet. The handle's hourglass<br>
contour and rounded end accommodate any size hands, and a reduced handle angle<br>
between 30-40 and preferably 35 degrees permits greater access and control. While the<br>
prior art includes restrictive conduits or mesh to retard fluid transfer, the wide mouth<br>
bottle of the present disclosure allows the mass of antiseptic to overcome surface tension<br>
and to drain rapidly to the absorbent member. The bottle contents evacuation is also<br>
speeded by the double piercing means which creates air ingress over the fluid layer in the<br>
fluid housing. Prior art sponges are shaped symmetrically to compensate for lack of<br>
manifolds. In contrast, the "c channel" manifolds of the present disclosure uniformly wet<br>
opposing ends of the asymmetric sponge. While prior art devices work poorly when<br>
inverted due to small sponge capacity and slow fluid transfer, the present disclosure<br>
provides for inverted use and faster prep since the large sponge acts as a reservoir for<br>
rapidly transferred fluid. The prior art includes a square sponge head and performs<br>
poorly on contoured topology. However, the contoured multi-use sponge conforms to<br>
any patient topology, and the integrated sponge neck region provides the dexterity of a<br>
conventional sponge stick with the speed of an applicator. The sponge has a thickness T<br>
that is twice the thickness of the prior art, which inures less risk injury to patient, and the<br>
longer sponge length L allows for faster prep.<br>
The components of medical skin applicator apparatus may be fabricated<br>
from materials suitable for medical applications, such as, for example, polymerics or<br>
metals, such as stainless steel, depending on the particular application and/or preference<br>
of a practitioner. Semi-rigid and rigid polymerics are contemplated for fabrication, as<br>
well as resilient materials, such as molded medical grade polypropylene. One skilled in<br>
the art, however, will realize that other materials and fabrication methods suitable for<br>
assembly and manufacture, in accordance with the present disclosure, also would be<br>
appropriate.<br>
FIGS. 44-46 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the present disclosure.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, skin applicator apparatus 600 incorporates an<br>
alternate mechanism to releasably secure the fluid container assembly in the first transit<br>
position. In particular, housing extension 602 includes a pair of outer circumferential<br>
partial ribs 604 in diametrically opposed relation on the outer surface of button 606. Ribs<br>
604 reside beyond outer housing 608 in the first transit position of fluid housing 610<br>
depicted in FIGS. 44-45. Outer housing 608 defines a restricted opening 612 at its<br>
proximal end, which has an internal dimension or diameter less than the effective crosssectional<br>
dimension of housing extension 602 across and inclusive of partial ribs 604.<br>
Thus, partial ribs 604 prevent passage of housing extension 602 through opening 612 of<br>
outer housing 608. When it is decided that apparatus 600 will be actuated, the<br>
practitioner exerts a distal pressure to button 606 of housing extension 602 which causes<br>
partial ribs 604 and/or the respective walls of housing extension 602 and outer housing<br>
608 to flex, deform, etc. to permit passage of the partial ribs 604 through the restricted<br>
opening 612 thereby enabling fluid housing 610 to move to its second actuated position<br>
depicted in FIG. 46. It is further envisioned that housing extension 602 may be secured<br>
in the second actuated position through the provision of internal locking tabs or recesses<br>
within outer housing 608. The internal tabs or recesses may be appropriately<br>
dimensioned to engage, receive, the partial ribs 604 in a secured relation. Absorbent<br>
member 614 includes a plurality of openings 616 extending completely through its<br>
thickness as disclosed in FIG. 45. Openings 616 replace the slits of prior embodiments<br>
Another feature of applicator apparatus 600 and apparatus 500 of FIG. 44<br>
is the arrangement of the handle component relative to applicator head assembly. In<br>
particular, the handle components of these apparatuses are displaced relative to the<br>
applicator head assembly which facilitates manipulation of the apparatuses about the<br>
operative site. In particular, outer housing 608 and the internal components forming the<br>
fluid container assembly are arranged along a handle axis "j" as shown in FIG. 44.<br>
Applicator head assembly 620 including applicator frame 622 is coaxially arranged about<br>
axis "k". As appreciated axis "k" is vertically displaced relative to axis "j" by a<br>
predetermined distance but is preferably in parallel relation. This offset allow the<br>
practitioner to maintain the most preferred 35 degree relationship with the patient while<br>
allowing for additional clearance due to this offset thereby maintaining a "comfort zone"<br>
in relation to the patient's skin, e.g., the practitioner's hand is displaced from the patient<br>
to enhance maneuverability around the operation site.<br>
FIGS. 47-48 illustrate another alternate embodiment of the skin applicator<br>
apparatus of the present disclosure. In accordance with this embodiment, skin applicator<br>
apparatus 700 is releasably secured in its transit position via detachable tag 702. In<br>
particular, housing extension 704 attached to fluid housing 706 includes transverse bore<br>
708 within manually engageable button 710. Releasable tag 702 is positioned within<br>
transverse bore 708 and when positioned within the bore 708 prevents advancement of<br>
housing extension 704 and attached fluid housing (not shown) thereby releasably<br>
securing apparatus 700 in the first transit position. Releasable tag 702 may be removed<br>
from transverse bore 708 to permit activation of the apparatus and movement of the fluid<br>
container assembly to the second actuated position. Releasable tab 702 may be fabricated<br>
from any solid or flexible material and preferably incorporates handle 712 to facilitate<br>
grasping by the practitioner. Absorbent member 714 of the applicator head assembly<br>
preferable incorporates longitudinal channel 716 in its lower surface to provide a greater<br>
volume of fluid flow. Channel 716 may be in connection with slots or openings<br>
extending through the absorbent member 714.<br>
FIGS. 49-50 illustrate another alternate embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure useful for dispensing clear antiseptics such as Chlorhexidine Gluconate/<br>
Alcohol solutions. Clear antiseptics pose a problem to practitioners since it is difficult to<br>
verify the area of coverage after application. Skin applicator apparatus 800 is<br>
substantially similar to the skin applicator apparatus discussed in connection with FIG. 29<br>
but further includes a dye chamber for introducing a dye or coloring agent to the medical<br>
agent or fluid. Specifically, fluid housing 802 has foil liner 804 connected thereto as<br>
discussed hereinabove and first end cap 806 threadably mounted to the housing 802.<br>
Apparatus 800 further includes second end cap 808 mounted to first end cap 806. In one<br>
preferred arrangement, first end cap 806 includes external threads 810 and second end<br>
cap 808 includes corresponding internal threads 812 which threadably engage the<br>
external threads 810 to secure the second end cap 808 to the first end cap 806. Second<br>
end cap 808 also includes foil liner 814 secured within the interior of the end cap. In the<br>
mounted condition of second end cap 808 to first end cap 806, a chamber 816 is defined<br>
between the respective foil liners 814, 804 of the two components. A dye or coloring<br>
agent 818 is stored within chamber 816. A suitable dye is FD&amp;C green #3 dye<br>
manufactured by Parchem Trading Ltd. White Plains, NY 10601. During actuation of the<br>
apparatus, the penetrating members 820 of applicator frame 822 pierce both liners 814,<br>
804 whereby the dye 818 within chamber 816 mixes with the medical agent during<br>
passage through applicator frame 822. The dye thus colors the medical agent or<br>
antiseptic to a desired color.<br>
FIG. 51 illustrates an alternate embodiment in which a dye tablet 850 is<br>
positioned within applicator frame 822. Preferably, the tablet 850 containing the dye is<br>
positioned within internal conduit 854 adjacent absorbent member 856. The dye tablet is<br>
contacted by the medical agent as it is transferred to the absorbent member 856. The dye<br>
tablet may be composed of the dye discussed in connection with the embodiment of<br>
FIGS. 49-50.<br>
FIGS. 52-54 illustrate another alternate embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure. Skin applicator apparatus 900 includes an alternate mechanism for severing<br>
the foil liner. The mechanism is preferably in the form of a circular array of penetrating<br>
members or spikes 902 extending from internal collar 904 of applicator frame 906 which<br>
is shown in perspective view in FIG. 52. This circular array is adapted to form a general<br>
circular opening within foil liner 908 attached to fluid housing 910. In further<br>
accordance with this embodiment, fluid housing 910 is provided with an internal dividing<br>
wall 912 extending in a general longitudinal direction. Similarly, internal collar 904 may<br>
be provided with longitudinal wall 914. Internal walls 912,914 serve to engage and rotate<br>
the wall portion of foil liner 908 severed by the circular array of penetrating members<br>
902 from its original transverse position to a rotated position in general alignment with<br>
the longitudinal axis (as shown in FIG, 54) upon movement of fluid housing 910 to the<br>
second position of FIG. 54. In this position, the medical agent can flow in an unrestricted<br>
manner through applicator frame 906 unimpeded by the severed foil liner 908.<br>
Preferably, the internal walls 912, 914 within fluid housing 910 and internal collar 904 of<br>
applicator frame 906 are radially displaced or longitudinally misaligned such that the<br>
severed wall portion of the foil liner is trapped between the two walls 912,914 upon<br>
movement to the second actuated position. In other respects, this embodiment functions<br>
in a similar manner to the prior embodiment of FIG. 29.<br>
Referring now to 55-58, an alternative embodiment in accordance with the<br>
principals of the present disclosure is disclosed. Skin applicator apparatus 1000 includes<br>
fluid container assembly 1002 which is tethered to the applicator 1004 through a tether<br>
line 1006. More specifically, fluid container assembly 1002 includes fluid housing 1008,<br>
foil liner 1010 and end cap 1012 which is threadably mounted to fluid housing 1008. End<br>
cap 1012 includes internal thread 1014 which threadably engages external thread 1016<br>
(FIG. 58) of fluid housing 1008. Applicator 1004 includes O-ring connector 1018 to<br>
which tether 1006 is connected. O-ring connector 1018 is positioned over the neck 1020<br>
of end cap 1012 and retainer therein by circumferential rib 1022 on the exterior of the<br>
neck 1020. Applicator 1004 incorporates a circumferential array of penetrating members<br>
1024 similar to the array discussed in the prior embodiment for piercing liner 1010.<br>
Applicator 1004 incorporates a plurality of spaced bulbous applicator tip 1026 with a<br>
plurality of spaced openings 1028 for dispensing the medical agent. A circular absorbent<br>
sponge 1030 may be mounted onto applicator tip 1026. In use, applicator 1004 can be<br>
pivoted onto assembly 1002 and secured to the fluid container 1002 through reception of<br>
circumferential rib 1022 with annular recess 1032 within applicator 1004. Other means<br>
are also envisioned including an interference fit, snap fit, bayonet coupling or the like.<br>
Mounting of the applicator 1004 causes the spikes to penetrate the liner thereby<br>
activating the apparatus 1000.<br>
It will be understood that various modifications and changes in form and<br>
detail may be made to the embodiments of the present disclosure without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the above description should not be<br>
