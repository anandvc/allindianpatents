				<td>DELIVERING PARTICULATE MATERIAL<br>
TO A VAPORIZATION ZONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of physical vapor<br>
deposition of particulate material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An OLED device includes a substrate, an anode, a holetransporting<br>
layer made of an organic compound, an organic luminescent layer<br>
with suitable dopants, an organic electron-transporting layer, and a cathode.<br>
OLED devices are attractive because of their low driving voltage, high luminance,<br>
wide-angle viewing and capability for full-color flat emission displays. Tang et<br>
al. described this multilayer OLED device in their U.S. Patent Nos. 4,769,292 and<br>
4,885,211.<br>
Physical vapor deposition in a vacuum environment is the principal<br>
means of depositing thin organic material films as used in small molecule OLED<br>
devices. Such methods are well known, for example Barr in U.S. 2,447,789 and<br>
Tanabe et al. in EP 0 982 411. The organic materials used in the manufacture of<br>
OLED devices are often subject to degradation when maintained at or near the<br>
desired rate dependant vaporization temperature for extended periods of time.<br>
Exposure of sensitive organic materials to higher temperatures can cause changes<br>
in the structure of the molecules and associated changes in material properties.<br>
To overcome the thermal sensitivity of these materials, only small<br>
quantities of organic materials have been loaded in sources and they are heated as<br>
little as possible. In this manner, the material is consumed before it has reached<br>
the temperature exposure threshold to cause significant degradation. The<br>
limitations with this practice are that the available vaporization rate is very low<br>
due to the limitation on heater temperature, and the operation time of the source is<br>
very short due to the small quantity of material present in the source. In the prior<br>
art, it has been necessary to vent the deposition chamber, disassemble and clean<br>
the vapor source, refill the source, reestablish vacuum in the deposition chamber<br>
and degas the just-introduced organic material over several hours before resuming<br>
operation. The low deposition rate and the frequent and time consuming process<br>
associated with recharging a source has placed substantial limitations on the<br>
throughput of OLED manufacturing facilities.<br>
A secondary consequence of heating the entire organic material<br>
charge to roughly the same temperature is that it is impractical to mix additional<br>
organic materials, such as dopants, with a host material unless the vaporization<br>
behavior and vapor pressure of the dopant is very close to that of the host material.<br>
This is generally not the case and, as a result, prior art devices frequently require<br>
the use of separate sources to co-deposit host and dopant materials.<br>
A consequence of using single component sources is that many<br>
sources are required in order to produce films containing a host and multiple<br>
dopants. These sources are arrayed one next to the other with the outer sources<br>
angled toward the center to approximate a co-deposition condition. In practice,<br>
the number of linear sources used to co-deposit different materials has been<br>
limited to three. This restriction has imposed a substantial limitation on the<br>
architecture of OLED devices, increases the necessary size and cost of the vacuum<br>
deposition chamber and decreases the reliability of the system.<br>
Additionally, the use of separate sources creates a gradient effect in<br>
the deposited film where the material in the source closest to the advancing<br>
substrate is over represented in the initial film immediately adjacent the substrate<br>
while the material in the last source is over represented in the final film surface.<br>
This gradient co-deposition is unavoidable in prior art methods where a single<br>
material is vaporized from each of multiple sources. The gradient in the deposited<br>
film is especially evident when the contribution of either of the end sources is<br>
more than a few percent of the central source, such as when a co-host is used.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of such a prior-art vaporization device 5,<br>
which includes three individual sources 6, 7, and 8, commonly termed "heating<br>
boats", for vaporizing organic material. Vapor plume 9 is preferably<br>
homogeneous in the materials from the different sources, but in fact varies in<br>
composition from side to side resulting in a non-homogeneous coating on<br>
substrate 15.<br>
A further limitation of prior art sources is that the geometry of the<br>
vapor manifold changes as the organic material charge is consumed. This change<br>
requires that the heater temperature change to maintain a constant vaporization<br>
rate and it is observed that the overall plume shape of the vapor exiting the<br>
orifices can change as a function of the organic material thickness and distribution<br>
in the source, particularly when the conductance to vapor flow in the source with a<br>
full charge of material is low enough to sustain pressure gradients from nonunifonn<br>
vaporization within the source. In this case, as the material charge is<br>
consumed, the conductance increases and the pressure distribution and hence<br>
overall plume shape improve.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an effective way<br>
of transferring particulate material from a container to a vaporization zone.<br>
This object is achieved by a method for vaporizing particulate<br>
materials and condensing them onto a surface to form a layer, comprising:<br>
(a) providing a quantity of particulate material in a first<br>
container having an opening,<br>
wherein the opening is dimensioned to allow free flow of the<br>
particulate material through the opening;<br>
(b) transferring such particulate material through the opening to<br>
an auger; and,<br>
(c) rotating at least a portion of the auger to transfer the<br>
particulate material from the first container along a feeding path to a vaporization<br>
zone where at least a component portion of the particulate material is vaporized<br>
and delivered to the surface to form the layer,<br>
wherein the auger size is selected to facilitate the free flow of the<br>
particulate material through the opening.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the continuous<br>
heating of material during operation of prior art devices is eliminated in that only<br>
a small portion of particulate material is heated, for a short period of time and at a<br>
controlled rate. The bulk of particulate material is maintained at a temperature<br>
that can be as much as 300°C cooler than the desired rate-dependent vaporization<br>
temperature. This can be particularly advantageous when vaporizing organic<br>
materials.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can<br>
maintain a steady vaporization rate with a continuously replenished charge of<br>
particulate material and with a steady heater temperature. The device thus allows<br>
extended operation of the source with substantially reduced risk of degrading even<br>
highly temperature-sensitive organic materials.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it permits<br>
materials having different vaporization rates and degradation temperature<br>
thresholds to be co-sublimated in the same source.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it permits<br>
linear vaporization rate control by controlling the volumetric metering rate or<br>
controlling the feed pressure of the compacted particulate material.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can rapidly<br>
stop and reinitiate vaporization and achieve a steady vaporization rate quickly by<br>
controlling the metering rate of the particulate material, minimizing contamination<br>
of the deposition chamber walls and conserving the particulate materials when a<br>
substrate is not being coated.<br>
It is a further advantage that the present device achieves<br>
substantially higher vaporization rates man in prior art devices with substantially<br>
reduced material degradation. Further still, no heater temperature change is<br>
required as the source material is consumed.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that it can provide<br>
a vapor source in any orientation, which is frequently not possible with prior-art<br>
devices.<br>
It is a further advantage of some embodiments of this invention<br>
that it can remove adsorbed gases from the particulate material through the use of<br>
heat and vacuum as a much smaller quantity of material is conveyed through the<br>
device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown a three-dimensional view of<br>
one embodiment of an apparatus according to the present invention for vaporizing<br>
organic particulate materials and condensing them onto a surface to form a layer.<br>
Vaporization apparatus 10 includes manifold 20 and attached feeding apparatus<br>
40. Feeding apparatus 40 includes at least first container 50 and feeding path 60,<br>
and can also include second container 70. First container 50 is provided with a<br>
quantity of organic material in a particulate form, such as a powder in one<br>
embodiment. Second container 70 can receive the organic particulate material and<br>
transfer it to first container 50 as will become evident. Manifold 20 includes one<br>
or more apertures 30 through which vaporized organic material can exit to a<br>
substrate surface. Manifold 20 is shown in an orientation whereby it can form a<br>
layer on a vertically-oriented substrate, but it is not limited to this orientation.<br>
Manifold 20 can be oriented horizontally and can form a layer on a horizontal<br>
substrate. Manifold 20 had been described in detail by Long et al. in commonlyassigned,<br>
above-cited U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/784,585. Feeding<br>
apparatus 40 is shown attached to the bottom of manifold 20, that is, opposite to<br>
apertures 30, but feeding apparatus 40 can also be attached to a side of manifold<br>
20. The nature of the attachment of feeding apparatus 40 to manifold 20 will<br>
become clear.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 3, there is shown a cross-sectional view of<br>
one embodiment of a portion of the above vaporization apparatus for feeding<br>
particulate material according to the present invention whereby organic material is<br>
effectively fluidized and transferred to the auger structure. First container 50<br>
holds organic particulate material 160, which is in the form of a finely divided<br>
powder and is desirably of a uniform size, and which feeds into auger structure 80<br>
in feeding path 60. Auger structure 80 passes through the interior of first<br>
container 50 and feeds into the manifold described above (not shown for clarity).<br>
At least a portion of auger structure 80 is rotated by motor 90 so as to transfer the<br>
organic particulate material at a controlled volumetric rate or pressure along<br>
feeding path 60 to a vaporization zone where the organic component material is<br>
vaporized and subsequently delivered to a substrate to form a layer. Feeding path<br>
60, and therefore organic particulate material 160 flowing in feeding path 60, can<br>
be maintained at a temperature below the desired vaporization temperature of the<br>
organic component material. To facilitate the movement of organic particulate<br>
material 160 to auger structure 80, organic particulate material 160 may be<br>
fluidized by agitating organic particulate material 160 by using an agitating<br>
device, e.g. piezoelectric structure 130 or an electromechanical vibrator. Such<br>
fluidized material is more readily transferred to auger structure 80 by gravity feed.<br>
The addition of optional second container 70 to hold additional<br>
organic particulate material 100 provides several additional advantages. A large<br>
quantity of organic particulate material 100 can be charged in the apparatus,<br>
allowing continuous operation of the device for extended periods of time. By<br>
sensing the quantity of organic particulate material 160 in first container 50, e.g.<br>
by measuring the height of the column of organic particulate material 160, one can<br>
selectively meter the amount of organic particulate material 100 transferred from<br>
second container 70 to first container 50 and provide a substantially constant<br>
volume of organic particulate material 160 in first container 50, e.g. ±5 cm3. In<br>
practice, 10 cm3 of organic particulate material 160 is loaded in first container 50.<br>
Some embodiments described herein have great process latitude with respect to<br>
reliable organic particulate material 160 feeding over a wide range of material<br>
height in the container and can be run nearly to exhaustion without failing to feed<br>
additional organic particulate material 160. However, it is believed that multicomponent<br>
mixing homogeneity is fostered if an optimum material height is<br>
established and maintained in first container 50 to within ±10%. This minimizes<br>
variations in the feeding rate of organic participate material 160 to feeding path<br>
60. Also, second container 70 can be arranged to be refillable without affecting<br>
the operation of first container 50, allowing the device to be continuously operated<br>
for even longer periods of time. Organic particulate material 100 is maintained in<br>
second container 70 by e.g. screens 110 and 120, whose mesh size is chosen to<br>
prevent the free flow of powdered material. Screens 110 and 120 can also be the<br>
mechanism for providing measured quantities of organic particulate material 100<br>
to move from second container 70 to first container 50. Screens 110 and 120 may<br>
be contacted by agitating devices (not shown) that can be actuated to cause a<br>
quantity of organic particulate material 100 to pass through the screen mesh. Such<br>
devices include those to vibrate the screen, or a movable arm immediately above<br>
or below the screen to allow selective agitation of screens 110 and 120. A<br>
commercial flour sifter is one such device well adapted for use in this application.<br>
In these sifters, three screens are used and the top surface of each screen is<br>
contacted by rotatable arms that extend radially from the center of the sifter. The<br>
anns have a V shaped cross section so as to force the powdered organic particulate<br>
material 100 into a converging space between the ami and the screen as the ami<br>
rotates to thereby force a controlled volume of powdered organic particulate<br>
material 100 through the screen. A sensing system based on the height of organic<br>
particulate material 160 in first container 50 (or on an integrated signal derived<br>
from the deposition rate and time of operation) can serve to actuate the devices<br>
agitating screens 110 and 120 so as to maintain a nearly constant volume of<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160 in first container 50. Agitating devices<br>
such as piezoelectric structures 140 prevent the buildup of organic particulate<br>
material 100 in the feed path to first container 50. Piezoelectric structures can be<br>
vibrated with multiple frequencies, e.g. a siren effect, to prevent the buildup of<br>
organic particulate material 100 at vibrational nodes.<br>
For proper operation of feeding apparatus 40, it is important to<br>
maintain a uniform feed rate of organic particulate material 160. Organic<br>
particulate material 160 is generally provided in a powdered form. One important<br>
strategy for providing a free flow of organic particulate material 160 is to prevent<br>
bridging, a characteristic behavior of particulate materials such as powders that<br>
can occur when the powder particles self-assemble into a load-bearing structure<br>
about an opening or aperture and thereby obstruct the flow of powder through the<br>
opening. Bridging effects can occur, for example, when the dimensions of an<br>
aperture are too small to overcome a tendency of a particulate material to resist<br>
flow. Factors that may cause bridging can include particulate size relative to the<br>
aperture dimensions, humidity, electrostatic attraction between particles, vacuum<br>
levels, and friction. To alleviate this problem, the dimensions of an opening 230<br>
at the interface of first container 50 and feeding path 60, as shown in FIG. 3, must<br>
be sufficiently sized to overcome the bridging characteristics of the powdered<br>
material. This sizing requirement is best determined empirically, taking into<br>
account worst-case conditions for the particular organic particulate material 160<br>
that must be supplied, in a free flowing manner, to feeding path 60. Maintaining a<br>
neai'ly constant volume of organic particulate material 160 in first container 50<br>
also helps to promote a constant feed rate of organic particulate material 160 to<br>
auger structure 80. By properly sizing opening 230 and maintaining a sufficient<br>
volume of organic particulate material 160 in first container 50, a uniform feed<br>
rate can be achieved for many types of powdered organic particulate material 160,<br>
providing a flui.dized flow without requiring any supplemental form of agitation.<br>
Where the opening 230 must be narrow, feed rate uniformity can<br>
be assured when the organic particulate material 160 in proximity to the infeed<br>
portion of the screw auger is maintained in a fluidized state by an agitating device.<br>
This can be accomplished by slowly agitating organic particulate material 160<br>
immediately above the auger screw or by inducing vibration, e.g. by piezoelectric<br>
structure 130, into organic particulate material 160 that is tuned to induce liquidlike<br>
behavior of the powdered organic particulate material 160 but is not so<br>
energetic as to cause gas-like behavior.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 4, there is shown in further detail a crosssectional<br>
view of one embodiment of a portion of the above apparatus for feeding<br>
and vaporizing organic particulate material 160 according to the present invention.<br>
Auger structure 80 transfers powdered organic particulate material 160 along<br>
feeding path 60 into manifold 20 and heating element 170. Heating element 170<br>
can be e.g. a heated screen and has been previously described in detail by Long et<br>
al. Manifold 20 includes a vaporization zone which is defined as the region of<br>
feeding path 60 immediately adjacent to heating element 170. A thin crosssection<br>
of powdered organic particulate material 160 is heated to the desired ratedependent<br>
temperature, which is the temperature of heating element 170, by virtue<br>
of contact and thermal conduction, whereby the thin cross-section of powdered<br>
organic particulate material 160 vaporizes to be delivered to a substrate surface to<br>
form a layer. The auger structure 80 and its rotation rate control the rate at which<br>
organic particulate material 160 is fed to heating element 170. This linearly<br>
controls the rate of vaporization and therefore the rate at which organic particulate<br>
material 160 leaves the manifold in the vapor state. Thus the feed rate of the<br>
organic particulate material 160 to the auger structure 80 and to the vaporization<br>
zone controls the deposition rate of the vaporized organic particulate material 160<br>
onto the desired surface.<br>
Additionally, base 180 can be included. Base 180 is a heatdissipating<br>
structure to prevent much of the heat from heating element 170 from<br>
traversing the length of feeding path 60, and thus keeps the bulk of the organic<br>
particulate material 160 significantly cooler than the conditions it experiences in<br>
the vaporization zone immediately adjacent to heating element 170. Means of<br>
heat dissipation for base 180 have been described by Long et al. in commonlyassigned,<br>
above-cited U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/784,585. A steep<br>
thermal gradient thereby created protects all but the immediately vaporizing<br>
material from the high temperatures. The vaporized organic vapors rapidly pass<br>
through heating element 170 and can enter into the heated manifold 20. The<br>
residence time of organic particulate material 160 at the desired vaporization<br>
temperature is very short and, as a result, thermal degradation is greatly reduced.<br>
The residence time of the organic particulate material 160 at elevated temperature,<br>
that is, at the rate-dependent vaporization temperature, is orders of magnitude less<br>
than with prior art devices and methods (seconds vs. hours or days in the prior<br>
art), which permits heating organic particulate material 160 to higher temperatures<br>
than in the prior art. Thus, the current device and method can achieve<br>
substantially higher vaporization rates, without causing appreciable degradation of<br>
the components of organic particulate material 160.<br>
The organic particulate material 160 can include a single<br>
component, or can include two or more different organic material components,<br>
each one having a different vaporization temperature. The vaporization<br>
temperature can be determined by various means. For example, FIG. 5 shows a<br>
graphical representation of vapor pressure versus temperature for two component<br>
organic materials commonly used in OLED devices. The vapoiization rate is<br>
proportional to the vapor pressure, so for a desired vaporization rate, the data in<br>
FIG. 5 can be used to define the required heating temperature corresponding to the<br>
desired vaporization rate. In the case where the organic particulate material 160<br>
includes two or more organic components, the temperature of heating element 170<br>
is chosen such that the vaporization is feed-rate limited, that is, the vapor pressure<br>
at the heating element temperature is substantially above the desired partial<br>
pressure of that component in the manifold, so that each of the organic material<br>
components simultaneously vaporizes.<br>
Pressure develops in manifold 20 as vaporization proceeds, and<br>
streams of vapor exit manifold 20 through the series of apertures 30 shown in<br>
FIG. 2. Because only a small portion of organic particulate material 160—the<br>
portion resident in the vaporization zone—is heated to the rate-dependent<br>
vaporization temperature, while the bulk of the material is kept well below the<br>
vaporization temperature, it is possible to interrupt the vaporization by a means<br>
for interrupting heating at heating element 170, e.g. stopping the movement of<br>
auger structure 80. This can be done when a substrate surface is not being coated<br>
so as to conserve organic particulate material 160 and minimize contamination of<br>
any associated apparatus, such as the walls of a deposition chamber, which will be<br>
described below.<br>
Because heating element 170 can be a fine mesh screen that<br>
prevents powder or compacted material from passing freely through it, the<br>
manifold can be used in any orientation. For example, manifold 20 of FIG. 2 can<br>
be oriented downwards so as to coat a substrate placed below it. This is an<br>
advantage not found using the heating boats of the prior art.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6a, there is shown a cross-sectional view of<br>
one embodiment of an auger structure 80 useful in this invention. The auger<br>
structure SO includes an auger screw 85 that is turned by motor 90. The distance<br>
between the threads of the screw helix and the thread height are chosen to be<br>
sufficiently large that powdered organic particulate material 160 tends not to pack<br>
into and rotate with the helix, but rather to remain at the bottom of a horizontally<br>
oriented auger tube and be transported linearly by virtue of the relative motion<br>
between the auger screw 85 and the auger tube. For example, an auger screw 85<br>
with a 2.5 mm pitch screw lead and a 0.8 mm thread height has been found to be<br>
an effective combination in transporting and consolidating powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 in a horizontal orientation.<br>
The inventors have found that auger dimensions have an affect on<br>
maintaining a uniform flow rate. Similar to the bridging effects noted above with<br>
respect to the size of opening 230, proper auger sizing and screw thread pitch is<br>
best determined empirically, considering worst-case conditions for the particular<br>
composition of organic particulate material 160.<br>
The inventors have also found that the angle of auger screw threads<br>
can be optimized to facilitate free flow of organic particulate material 160 along<br>
feeding path 60. While optimal screw thread angle may vary somewhat<br>
depending on the particular component materials of pOAvdered organic particulate<br>
material 160, it has been determined that screw thread angles ranging from not<br>
less than about 4 degrees to no more than about 15 degrees relative to the<br>
rotational axis of auger structure 80 provide optimal flow conditions for the<br>
organic materials 160 that are conventionally used.<br>
Various materials and surface treatments of the auger shaft have<br>
been found to facilitate auger operation, allowing increased feed rates. While<br>
stainless steel may provide acceptable performance, additional benefit may be<br>
obtained by surface treatments such as electropolishing or by coatings, such as a<br>
coating of titanium nitride.<br>
While continuous auger rotation at a sustained rate may provide an<br>
acceptable level of performance, added benefits may be obtained by pulsing the<br>
auger, providing rotation of the auger shaft in a repeated incremental fashion. A<br>
pulsing action reduces the tendency for powdered organic particulate material 160<br>
to rotate with the auger screw by reducing the effective coefficient of friction<br>
between the auger screw and the particulate material. The powder feeding<br>
efficiency of auger structure 80 is thereby improved. Pulsing behavior may also<br>
be advantageous where it becomes useful to vary the feed rate over an interval, for<br>
example.<br>
In the horizontal orientation, the organic particulate material 160<br>
travels along the bottom of auger screw 85 in a tumbling and dispersed form. At<br>
the terminal end of auger screw 85, a powder pressure of 1 Mpa can be developed<br>
that increases the bulk density of the organic particulate material 160 to the point<br>
where it serves as a vapor seal, preventing vaporized material in the manifold<br>
having a pressure greater than the ambient vacuum level from flowing back along<br>
the auger screw to its source at first container 50. As shown in FIG. 6b, the<br>
terminal end of auger screw 85 is configured to have a thread-free portion 135<br>
having a constant circular cross section over a small length to constrain the<br>
consolidated powdered organic particulate material 160 to form a narrow annular<br>
or tubular shape. This narrow annular shape substantially improves the thermal<br>
contact and temperature uniformity through the organic particulate material 160,<br>
between the temperature-controlled auger screw 85 and the temperature-controlled<br>
feeding path 60. This configuration additionally assures good temperature<br>
uniformity of the organic particulate material 160 at a given transverse cross<br>
section relative to a circular cross section and substantially increases the attainable<br>
temperature gradient in the organic particulate material 160 between the auger<br>
structure 80 and the heating element 170. The powdered organic particulate<br>
material 160 is extruded from the auger structure in a tubular shape and is<br>
sufficiently consolidated that it can maintain the tubular extruded form for at least<br>
several millimeters upon exiting the support of the auger tube. This solid form<br>
prevents pressurized vapor, resulting from organic material vaporization, from<br>
flowing back into the auger structure 80 and enables the powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 to bridge the short gap between the end of the<br>
temperature-controlled auger structure and the heating element.<br>
Thermal modeling of a powder dispensing system having this<br>
annular configuration where the heating element is spaced 130 u,m from the end of<br>
the auger structure 80 indicates that an average axial thermal gradient of 0.5°C/|im<br>
can be achieved through the organic particulate material 160 spanning the heating<br>
element 170 and the terminal end of the auger structure 80 when the temperature<br>
differential between the two is 270°C. There can therefore be a 100°C<br>
temperature drop through the first 200 fim of consolidated powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160. This gradient prevents the usual leaching of more<br>
volatile constituents from bulk volumes of mixed-component organic materials<br>
and enables a single source to co-deposit multiple component organic materials.<br>
This large gradient is further instrumental in maintaining the organic particulate<br>
material 160 in a consolidated powder form at the exit of the auger tube even<br>
when component organic materials that liquefy before vaporizing are employed.<br>
The auger structure 80 shown in FIG. 6a is effective at transporting<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160 horizontally, but is not as effective in<br>
transporting powdered organic particulate material 160 vertically, since the<br>
powdered organic particulate material. 160 tends to simply rotate with the screw<br>
and not advance along the length of the structure. Turning now to FIG. 6c, there<br>
is a relief view of another embodiment of an auger structure useful in this<br>
invention. In this embodiment, auger structure 95 includes two or more auger<br>
screws, e.g. auger screws 85a, 85b, and 85c, with identical interlaced helical<br>
threads. All of the auger screws 85a, 85b, and 85c rotate in the same direction.<br>
Organic material that is packed between the threads of one auger screw, e.g. 85a,<br>
will be removed as the material rotates into contact with the interlaced thread of<br>
the second rotating auger screw, e.g. 85b, because the facing portions of adjacent<br>
screws move in opposite directions. Auger structure 95 thus overcomes the<br>
orientation restrictions of the single-screw auger structure of FIG. 6a while<br>
retaining the ability to consolidate the powdered organic particulate material 160<br>
into a solid shape and to form a vapor seal. The discharge portion of auger<br>
structure 95 would have an elongated cross-section that can extend across the<br>
entire length of the manifold so as to inject material substantially uniformly along<br>
its length.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6d, there is a cross-sectional view of another<br>
embodiment of an auger structure useful in this invention. Auger structure 105<br>
includes a rotating helical thread 115, a stationary center portion 125, and a<br>
stationary outer tube, which in this case is feeding path 60. In this embodiment,<br>
only a portion of auger structure 105—the portion comprising helical threads<br>
115—rotates and is turned by motor 90. Powdered organic particulate material<br>
160 feeding with circular cross section helical threads has been demonstrated.<br>
The thread consisted of a steel wire 0.7 mm diameter formed into a helix of 5 mm<br>
outside diameter and 2.5 mm pitch. Smooth wires of other materials such as<br>
titanium and stainless steel are also suitable. The wire can also have a noncircular<br>
cross section, with a rectangular cross section being particularly<br>
advantageous as it provides additional rigidity to prevent the helical thread from<br>
changing dimensions as it encounters torsional resistance while pushing the<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160. Stationary center portion 125, in<br>
cooperation with feeding path 60, substantially prevents all but a thin film of<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160 from rotating with the auger. Auger<br>
structure 105 does not rely on gravity to accumulate powdered organic particulate<br>
material 160 and will operate in any orientation. Auger structure 105 also<br>
consolidates the powdered organic particulate material 160 into a thin annular<br>
shape that substantially improves the thermal contact between the powdered<br>
organic particulate material 160 and temperature-controlled feeding path 60 and<br>
stationary center portion 125. These characteristics are significant in enabling the<br>
controlled vaporization of mixed component organic materials, and component<br>
organic materials that liquefy before vaporizing. Thus this embodiment<br>
overcomes the orientation restrictions of the first auger structure while retaining<br>
the ability to consolidate the powdered organic particulate material 160 into a<br>
solid shape and form a vapor seal.<br>
The above embodiments of this invention, based primarily on<br>
vaporization apparatus 10 of FIG. 2, are useful at atmospheric pressure and<br>
pressures down to about one-half atmosphere. Experimentally, it has been<br>
observed that fine powder is considerably more difficult to meter in a partial<br>
vacuum below half an atmosphere. The powdered organic particulate material<br>
160 agglomerates as residual air molecules are removed, and undergoes a<br>
reduction of the elastic coupling between particles that is effective in<br>
communicating vibrational energy through powdered organic particulate material<br>
160 under atmospheric conditions. This effect negatively influences the powderfeeding<br>
uniformity of the auger structure. Therefore, a different agitating device<br>
can be necessary. Turning now to FIG. 7, there is shown a cutaway view of<br>
another embodiment of an agitating device useful in the present invention for<br>
overcoming the limitations in low-pressure conditions. This embodiment employs<br>
three piezoelectric structures as the agitating device. Piezoelectric structures 150<br>
and 155 are inclined at a steep angle and form opposite walls of a funnel at the<br>
bottom of first container 50. The bottom portion 190 of these two piezoelectric<br>
structures is not supported and leads directly to the infeed portion of auger<br>
structure 80. The unsupported portions of the piezoelectric structures 150 and 155<br>
have high vibration amplitude and are effective in fluidizing powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 in proximity to their surfaces. The third piezoelectric<br>
structure 130 is mounted below auger structure 80 and imparts vibration whose<br>
amplitude is essentially perpendicular to the vibration of the other two<br>
piezoelectric structures 150 and 155. The piezoelectric structures are driven by a<br>
frequency sweeping circuit. The changing frequency is instrumental in preventing<br>
the formation of nodes and improves the powder feeding efficiency considerably.<br>
Auger structure 80 can be any of the above-described auger structures.<br>
FIG. 8 is a cutaway view of another embodiment of an agitating<br>
device useful in the present invention for overcoming the limitations in lowpressure<br>
conditions; Opening 230 represents the lower end of the above-described<br>
first container 50. Rotating thread type device 210 includes left- and right-hand<br>
helically wound wires on a common shaft. Rotating thread type device 210 is<br>
positioned above the infeed portion of the auger structure such that the wires are<br>
substantially tangent to the threads of auger structure 80. The rotating thread<br>
should not interfere with the auger screw threads, but it will continue to operate<br>
effectively with as much as 1 mm clearance. Rotating thread type device 210 is<br>
slowly rotated via gear drive 220, by motor 90, which also turns auger structure<br>
80. In practice, the rotational speed of the rotating thread type device 210 can<br>
vary depending on the particle size and properties of the particular powdered<br>
organic particulate material 160, but a practical guide is to have the axial slew rate<br>
of the rotating thread match the axial slew rate of the threads of the auger screw.<br>
The wires of rotating thread type device 210 tend to push powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 toward the center of opening 230 and prevent powder<br>
biidging over auger structure 80. Auger structure 80 can be any of the abovedescribed<br>
auger structures. This agitating device is well adapted to feeding<br>
mixed-component organic materials as it imparts very little energy to powdered<br>
organic particulate material 160 and is therefore not likely to cause particle<br>
separation by size or density.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 9, there is shown a three-dimensional view of<br>
a portion of another embodiment of an apparatus according to the present<br>
invention for vaporizing1 powdered organic materials 160 and condensing them<br>
onto a surface to form a layer, including an apparatus for pre-conditioning organic<br>
particulate material 160 to drive off adsorbed gasses or impurities. The apparatus<br>
includes first container 50 as described above for holding a quantity of organic<br>
particulate material 160. The apparatus can also include a second container 70 for<br>
holding a reserve quantity of organic particulate material 100 that can be fed to<br>
first container 50. The apparatus can also include agitating devices such as<br>
piezoelectric structure 140 to facilitate the movement of organic particulate<br>
material 100 from second container 70 to first container 50. Organic particulate<br>
material 160 from first container 50 is fed into first feeding path 260 for preconditioning.<br>
First feeding path 260 includes an auger structure in association<br>
with first container 50 for transferring the organic particulate material 160 from<br>
first container 50 to first feeding path 260. At least a portion of the auger<br>
structure is turned by motor 240 to feed powdered organic particulate material 160<br>
along first feeding path 260. First feeding path 260 includes vacuum exposure<br>
opening 270, which is in communication with a source of partial vacuum. First<br>
feeding path 260 can alternately be heated so as to heat the powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 while exposing it to a partial vacuum so as to drive off<br>
adsorbed gasses or impurities as the organic particulate material 160 is transferred<br>
along first feeding path 260 to the vaporization zone as pre-conditioned organic<br>
particulate material 160. For typical deposition rates, the free powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 has several minutes to liberate adsorbed water vapor and<br>
gas molecules in this pre-conditioning phase, just prior to being compacted and<br>
vaporized. The pre-conditioned powdered organic particulate material 160 is then<br>
transferred to second feeding path 265, which is defined by an auger structure as<br>
described above, in which it is consolidated, that is, it is compacted and evenly<br>
distributed around the auger structure. Powdered organic particulate material 160<br>
is fed along second feeding path 265 by the auger structure to a manifold and<br>
vaporization zone (not shown) as described above, where the organic material is<br>
vaporized and subsequently condensed onto the surface of an OLED substrate to<br>
form an organic layer. Optional third container 250 can receive the exposed<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160 from first feeding path 260. In such a<br>
case, the auger structure that defines second feeding path 265 is also associated<br>
with third container 250 for feeding exposed powdered organic particulate<br>
material 160 to second feeding path 265, and such auger structure passes through<br>
the interior of third container 250. This apparatus also includes means for<br>
fluidizing the powdered organic particulate material 160, as already described. In<br>
an alternative embodiment, feeding path 260 includes vacuum exposure opening<br>
270 and feeds directly to a manifold without the use of a second feeding path.<br>
In practice, the apparatus described herein is operated as follows.<br>
A powdered organic particulate material 160, which is useful in forming a layer<br>
on an OLED device, is provided into second container 70. The organic particulate<br>
material 160 is transferred in a controlled manner to first container 50 in such a<br>
way as to maintain a substantially constant volume of powdered organic<br>
particulate material 160 in first container 50. The powdered organic particulate<br>
material 160 is fluidized by means described herein and thereby transferred to an<br>
auger structure SO, which transfers the powdered organic particulate material 160<br>
to a vaporization zone as described herein. The organic parti culate material 160 is<br>
vaporized in the vaporization zone into a manifold 20, which delivers the<br>
vaporized organic material to the surface of an OLED substrate to form a layer, as<br>
will be described below.<br>
As has been noted hereinabove, vacuum levels may tend to<br>
complicate the problem of metering out uniform amounts of finely powdered<br>
organic materials 160. Referring back to FIG. 2, it can be observed that a<br>
continuous column of organic parti culate material 160 is maintained in feeding<br>
path 60. In one embodiment, this column of organic particulate material 160, if<br>
suitably compacted, can be utilized as a type of vacuum seal, where particulate<br>
characteristics of organic particulate material 160 allow. With this arrangement, a<br>
high vacuum level can be present for organic particulate material 160 at heating<br>
element 170 and in the manifold 20. A lower vacuum level can then be<br>
maintained at first container 50, which may even be at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Even a partial seal could be advantageous. This sealing effect could also be used<br>
to isolate ambient gases used for storage of organic particulate material 160 in<br>
first container 50 and/or for organic particulate material 100 in second container<br>
70. With some materials, for example, it is beneficial to store materials under an<br>
inert gas such as argon or helium.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 10, there is shown an embodiment of a device<br>
of this disclosure including a deposition chamber enclosing a substrate.<br>
Deposition chamber 280 is an enclosed apparatus that permits an OLED substrate<br>
285 to be coated with organic material transferred from manifold 20. Manifold 20<br>
is supplied with organic material via feeding path 60 as described above.<br>
Deposition chamber 280 is held under controlled conditions, e.g. a pressure of 1<br>
toir or less provided by vacuum source 300. Deposition chamber 280 includes<br>
load lock 275 which can be used to load uncoated OLED substrates 285, and<br>
unload coated OLED substrates. OLED substrate 285 can be moved by<br>
translational apparatus 295 to provide even coating of vaporized organic material<br>
over the entire surface of OLED substrate 285. Although vaporization apparatus<br>
is shown as partially enclosed by deposition chamber 280, it will be understood<br>
that other arrangements are possible, including arrangements wherein the entire<br>
vaporization apparatus, including any container or containers for holding the<br>
powdered organic particulate material 160, is enclosed by deposition chamber<br>
280.<br>
In practice, an OLED substrate 285 is placed in deposition chamber<br>
280 via load lock 275 and held by translational apparatus 295 or associated<br>
apparatus. The vaporization apparatus is operated as described above, and<br>
translational apparatus 295 moves OLED substrate 285 perpendicular to the<br>
direction of emission of organic material vapors from manifold 20, thus delivering<br>
vaporized organic material to the surface of OLED substrate 285 to condense and<br>
form a layer of organic material on the surface.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 11, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a<br>
pixel of a light-emitting OLED device 310 that can be prepared in part according<br>
to the present invention. The OLED device 310 includes at a minimum a<br>
substrate 320, a cathode 390, an anode 330 spaced from cathode 390, and a lightemitting<br>
layer 350. The OLED device can also include a hole-injecting layer 335,<br>
a hole-transporting layer 340, an electron-transporting layer 355, and an electroninjecting<br>
layer 360. Hole-injecting layer 335, hole-transporting layer 340, lightemitting<br>
layer 350, electron-transporting layer 355, and electron-injecting layer<br>
360 include a series of organic layers 370 disposed between anode 330 and<br>
cathode 390. Organic layers 370 are the organic material layers most desirably<br>
deposited by the device and method of this invention. These components will be<br>
described in more detail.<br>
Substrate 320 can be an organic solid, an inorganic solid, or a<br>
combination of organic and inorganic solids. Substrate 320 can be rigid or<br>
flexible and can be processed as separate individual pieces, such as sheets or<br>
wafers, or as a continuous roll. Typical substrate materials include glass, plastic,<br>
metal, ceramic, semiconductor, metal oxide, semiconductor oxide, semiconductor<br>
nitride, or combinations thereof. Substrate 320 can be a homogeneous mixture of<br>
materials, a composite of materials, or multiple layers of materials. Substrate 320<br>
can be an OLED substrate, that is a substrate commonly used for preparing OLED<br>
devices, e.g. active-matrix low-temperature polysilicon or amorphous-silicon TFT<br>
substrate. The substrate 320 can either be light transmis'sive or opaque, depending<br>
on the intended direction of light emission. The light transmissive property is<br>
desirable for viewing the EL emission through the substrate. Transparent glass or<br>
plastic are commonly employed in such cases. For applications where the EL<br>
emission is viewed through the top electrode, the transmissive characteristic of the<br>
bottom support is immaterial, and therefore can be light transmissive, light<br>
absorbing or light reflective. Substrates for use in this case include, but are not<br>
limited to, glass, plastic, semiconductor materials, ceramics, and circuit board<br>
materials, or any others commonly used in the formation of OLED devices, which<br>
can be either passive-matrix devices or active-matrix devices.<br>
An electrode is formed over substrate 320 and is most commonly<br>
configured as an anode 330. When EL emission is viewed through the substrate<br>
320, anode 330 should be transparent or substantially transparent to the emission<br>
of interest. Common transparent anode materials useful in this invention are<br>
indium-tin oxide and tin oxide, but other metal oxides can work including, but not<br>
limited to, aluminum- or indium-doped zinc oxide, magnesium-indium oxide, and<br>
nickel-tungsten oxide. In addition to these oxides, metal nitrides such as gallium<br>
nitride, metal selenides such as zinc selenide, and metal sulfides such as zinc<br>
sulfide, can be used as an anode material. For applications where EL emission is<br>
viewed through the top electrode, the transmissive characteristics of the anode<br>
material are immaterial and any conductive material can be used, transparent,<br>
opaque or reflective. Example conductors for this application include, but are not<br>
limited to, gold, indium, molybdenum, palladium, and platinum. The preferred<br>
anode materials, transmissive or otherwise, have a work function of 4.1 eV or<br>
greater. Desired anode materials can be deposited by any suitable means such as<br>
evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, or electrochemical means.<br>
Anode materials can be patterned using well known photolithographic processes.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that a hole-injecting<br>
layer 335 be formed over anode 330 in an organic light-emitting display. The<br>
hole-injecting material can serve to improve the film formation property of<br>
subsequent organic layers and to facilitate injection of holes into the holetransporting<br>
layer. Suitable materials for use in hole-injecting layer 335 include,<br>
but are not limited to, porphyrinic compounds as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,720,432, plasma-deposited fluorocarbon polymers as described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,208,075, and inorganic oxides including vanadium oxide (VOx),<br>
molybdenum oxide (MoOx), nickel oxide (NiOx), etc. Alternative hole-injecting<br>
materials reportedly useful in organic EL devices are described in<br>
EP0891 121 Al andEP] 029 909 Al.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that a holetransporting<br>
layer 340 be formed and disposed over anode 330. Desired holetransporting<br>
materials can be deposited by any suitable means such as<br>
evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical means,<br>
thermal transfer, or laser thermal transfer from a donor material, and can be<br>
deposited by the device and method described herein. Hole-transporting materials<br>
useful in hole-transporting layer 340 are well known to include compounds such<br>
as an aromatic tertiary amine, where the latter is understood to be a compound<br>
containing at least one trivalent nitrogen atom that is bonded only to carbon<br>
atoms, at least one of which is a member of an aromatic ring. In one form the<br>
aromatic tertiary amine can be an arylamine, such as a monoarylamine,<br>
diarylamine, triarylamine, or a polymeric arylamine. Exemplary monomeric<br>
triarylamines are illustrated by Klupfel et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,180,730. Other<br>
suitable triarylamines substituted with one or more vinyl radicals and/or<br>
comprising at least one active hydrogen-containing group are disclosed by<br>
Brantley et al. in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,567,450 and 3,658,520.<br>
A more preferred class of aromatic tertiary amines are those which<br>
include at least two aromatic tertiary amine moieties as described in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,720,432 and 5,061,569. Such compounds include those represented by<br>
Qt and Ch are independently selected aromatic tertiary amine moieties; and<br>
G is a linking group such as an arylene, cycloalkylene, or alkylene group<br>
of a carbon to carbon bond.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one of Ql or Q2 contains a polycyclic<br>
fused ring structure, e.g., a naphthalene. When G is an aryl group, it is<br>
conveniently a phenylene, biphenylene, or naphthalene moiety.<br>
A useful class of tri aryl amines satisfying structural Formula A and<br>
containing two triarylamine moieties is represented by structural Formula B.<br>
where:<br>
RI and Ra each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an aryl group, or<br>
an alkyl group or Rt and R2 together represent the atoms completing a cycloalkyl<br>
group; and<br>
RS and R4 each independently represent an aryl group, which is in turn<br>
substituted with a diaryl substituted amino group, as indicated by structural<br>
wherein RS and R&amp; are independently selected aryl groups. In one embodiment, at<br>
least one of RS or Rg contains a polycyclic fused ring structure, e.g., a<br>
naphthalene.<br>
Another class of aromatic tertiary amines are the tetraaryldiamines.<br>
Desirable tetraaryldiamines include two diarylamino groups, such as indicated by<br>
Formula C, linked through an arylene group. Useful tetraaryldiamines include<br>
those represented by Formula D.<br>
each Are is an independently selected arylene group, such as a phenylene<br>
or anthracene moiety;<br>
n is an integer of from 1 to 4; and<br>
Ar, RT, RS, and Rg are independently selected aryl groups.<br>
In a typical embodiment, at least one of Ar, R?, Rg, and R? is a<br>
polycyclic fused ring structure, e.g., a naphthalene.<br>
The various alkyl, alkylene, aryl, and arylene moieties of the<br>
foregoing structural Formulae A, B, C, D, can each in turn be substituted. Typical<br>
substituents include alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryl groups, aryloxy groups, and<br>
halogens such as fluoride, chloride, and bromide. The various alkyl and alkylene<br>
moieties typically contain from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The cycloallcyl<br>
moieties can contain from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms, but typically contain five,<br>
six, or seven carbon atoms—e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl ring<br>
structures. The aryl and arylene moieties are usually phenyl and phenylene<br>
moieties.<br>
The hole-transporting layer in an OLED device can be formed of a<br>
single or a mixture of aromatic tertiary amine compounds. Specifically, one can<br>
employ a triarylamine, such as a triarylamine satisfying the Formula B, in<br>
combination with a tetraaryldiamine, such as indicated by Formula D. When a<br>
triarylamine is employed in combination with a tetraaryldiamine, the latter is<br>
positioned as a layer interposed between the triarylamine and the electroninjecting<br>
and transporting layer. The device and method described herein can be<br>
used to deposit single- or multi-component layers, and can be used to squentially<br>
deposit multiple layers.<br>
Another class of useiiil hole-transporting materials includes<br>
polycyclic aromatic compounds as described in EP 1 009 041. In addition,<br>
polymeric hole-transporting materials can be used such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole)<br>
(PVK), polythiophenes, polypyrrole, polyaniline, and copolymers such as<br>
polyp,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) also called<br>
PEDOT/PSS.<br>
Light-emitting layer 350 produces light in response to hole-electron<br>
recombination. Light-emitting layer 350 is commonly disposed over holetransporting<br>
layer 340. Desired organic light-emitting materials can be deposited<br>
by any suitable means such as evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition,<br>
electrochemical means, or radiation thermal transfer from a donor material, and<br>
can be deposited by the device and method described herein. Useful organic lightemitting<br>
materials are well known. As more fully described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,769,292 and 5,935,721, the light-emitting layers of the organic EL element<br>
include a luminescent or fluorescent material where electroluminescence is<br>
produced as a result of electron-hole pair recombination in this region. The lightemitting<br>
layers can include a single material, but more commonly include a host<br>
material doped with a guest compound or dopant where light emission comes<br>
primarily from the dopant. The dopant is selected to produce color light having a<br>
particular spectrum. The host materials in the light-emitting layers can be an<br>
electron-transporting material, as defined below, a hole-transporting material, as<br>
defined above, or another material that supports hole-electron recombination. The<br>
dopant is usually chosen from highly fluorescent dyes, but phosphorescent<br>
compounds, e.g., transition metal complexes as described in WO 98/55561, WO<br>
00/18851, WO 00/57676, and WO 00/70655 are also useful. Dopants are<br>
typically coated as 0.01 to 10 % by weight into the host material. The device and<br>
method described herein can be used to coat multi-component guest/host layers<br>
without the need for multiple vaporization sources.<br>
Host and emitting molecules known to be of use include, but are<br>
not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,768,292; 5,141,671;<br>
5,150,006; 5,151,629; 5,294,870; 5,405,709; 5,484,922; 5,593,788; 5,645,948;<br>
5,683,823; 5,755,999; 5,928,802; 5,935,720; 5,935,721; and 6,020,078.<br>
Metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline and similar derivatives<br>
(Formula E) constitute one class of useful host materials capable of supporting<br>
electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable for light emission of<br>
wavelengths longer than 500 nm, e.g., green, yellow, orange, and red.<br>
wherein:<br>
M represents a metal;<br>
n is an integer of from 1 to 3; and<br>
Z independently in each occurrence represents the atoms completing a<br>
nucleus having at least two fused aromatic rings.<br>
From the foregoing it is apparent that the metal can be a<br>
monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metal. The metal can, for example, be an alkali<br>
metal, such as lithium, sodium, or potassium; an alkaline earth metal, such as<br>
magnesium or calcium; or an earth metal, such as boron or aluminum. Generally<br>
any monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metal known to be a useful chelating metal<br>
can be employed.<br>
Z completes a heterocyclic nucleus containing at least two fused<br>
aromatic rings, at least one of which is an azole or azine ring. Additional rings,<br>
including both aliphatic and aromatic rings, can be fused with the two required<br>
rings, if required. To avoid adding molecular bulk without improving on function<br>
the number of ring atoms is usually maintained at 18 or less.<br>
The host material in light-emitting layer 350 can be an anthracene<br>
derivative having hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon substituents at the 9 and<br>
10 positions. For example, derivatives of 9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene<br>
constitute one class of useful host materials capable of supporting<br>
electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable for light emission of<br>
wavelengths longer than 400 nm, e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange or red.<br>
Benzazole derivatives constitute another class of useful host<br>
materials capable of supporting electroluminescence, and are particularly suitable<br>
for light emission of wavelengths longer than 400 nm, e.g., blue, green, yellow,<br>
orange or red. An example of a useful benzazole is 2, 2', 2"-( 1,3,5-<br>
phenyIene)tris[l-phenyl-lH-benzimidazole].<br>
Desirable fluorescent dopants include perylene or derivatives of<br>
perylene, derivatives of anthracene, tetracene, xanthene, rubrene, coumarin,<br>
rhodamine, quinacridone, dicyanomethylenepyran compounds, thiopyran<br>
compounds, polymethine compounds, pyrilium and thiapyrilium compounds,<br>
derivatives of distryrylbenzene or distyrylbiphenyl, bis(azinyl)methane boron<br>
complex compounds, and carbostyryl compounds.<br>
Other organic emissive materials can be polymeric substances, e.g.<br>
polyphenylenevinylene derivatives, dialkoxy-polyphenylenevinylenes, poly-paraphenylene<br>
derivatives, and polyfluorene derivatives, as taught by Wolk et al. in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,194,119 Bl and references cited therein.<br>
While not always necessary, it is often useful that OLED device<br>
310 includes an electron-transporting layer 355 disposed over light-emitting layer<br>
350. Desired electron-transporting materials can be deposited by any suitable<br>
means such as evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical<br>
means, thermal transfer, or laser thermal transfer from a donor material, and can<br>
be deposited by the device and method described herein. Preferred electrontransporting<br>
materials for use in electron-transporting layer 355 are metal chelated<br>
oxinoid compounds, including chelates of oxine itself (also commonly referred to<br>
as 8-quinolinol or 8-hydroxyquinoline). Such compounds help to inject and<br>
transport electrons and exhibit both high levels of performance and are readily<br>
fabricated in the form of thin films. Exemplary of contemplated oxinoid<br>
compounds are those satisfying structural Formula E, previously described.<br>
Other electron-transporting materials include various butadiene<br>
derivatives as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,356,429 and various heterocyclic<br>
optical brighteners as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,539,507. Benzazoles<br>
satisfying structural Formula G are also useful electron-transporting materials.<br>
Other electron-transporting materials can be polymeric substances,<br>
e.g. polyphenylenevinylene derivatives, poly-para-phenylene derivatives,<br>
polyfluorene derivatives, polythiophenes, polyacetylenes, and other conductive<br>
polymeric organic materials such as those listed in Handbook of Conductive<br>
Molecules and Polymers, Vols. 1-4, H.S. Nalwa, ed., John Wiley and Sons,<br>
Chichester (1997).<br>
An electron-injecting layer 360 can also be present between the<br>
cathode and the electron-transporting layer. Examples of electron-injecting<br>
materials include alkaline or alkaline earth metals, alkali halide salts, such as LiF<br>
mentioned above, or alkaline or alkaline earth metal doped organic layers.<br>
Cathode 390 is formed over the electron-transporting layer 355 or<br>
over light-emitting layer 350 if an electron-transporting layer is not used. When<br>
light emission is through the anode 330, the cathode material can include nearly<br>
any conductive material. Desirable materials have good film-forming properties<br>
to ensure good contact with the underlying organic layer, promote electron<br>
injection at low voltage, and have good stability. Useful cathode materials often<br>
contain a low work function metal (
cathode material is comprised of a Mg:Ag alloy wherein the percentage of silver<br>
is in the range of 1 to 20 %, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,885,221. Another<br>
suitable class of cathode materials includes bilayers comprised of a thin layer of a<br>
low work function metal or metal salt capped with a thicker layer of conductive<br>
metal. One such cathode is comprised of a thin layer of LiF followed by a thicker<br>
layer of Al as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,572. Other useful cathode<br>
materials include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,059,861; 5,059,862; and 6,140,763.<br>
When light emission is viewed through cathode 390, it must be<br>
transparent or nearly transparent. For such applications, metals must be thin or<br>
one must use transparent conductive oxides, or a combination of these materials.<br>
Optically transparent cathodes have been described in more detail in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,776,623. Cathode materials can be deposited by evaporation, sputtering, or<br>
chemical vapor deposition. When needed, patterning can be achieved through<br>
many well known methods including, but not limited to, through-mask deposition,<br>
integral shadow masking as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,276,380 and EP 0 732<br>
868, laser ablation, and selective chemical vapor deposition.<br>

The invention has been described in detail with particular reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, namely for delivery of organic<br>
particulate materials to a vaporization zone. However, it can be appreciated that<br>
the present invention applies more broadly to particulate materials, including<br>
organic and other types of particulate materials. The term "particulate materials"<br>
can include a broad range of substances in particulate form, including, but not<br>
limited to, crystals, nanotubes, powders, needles, flakes, and other solid materials<br>
that can be classified as discontinuous, for example. Moreover, the particulate<br>
materials may be provided in a mixture containing a quantity of inert material or<br>
materials acting as a earner for the component material. Inert earners could<br>
include other types of solid materials as well as pastes and liquids, particularly<br>
liquid materials having higher viscosities. Any inert material selected must be<br>
compatible with the vaporization process, such that the inert carrier is<br>
appropriately discarded before or during the vaporization of the component<br>
particulate material. For example, the inert carrier can be selected from materials<br>
having a much higher vaporization temperature than the desired particulate<br>
component material. As just one example, organic particulate material 100 (FIG.<br>
3) could be a mixture containing sand and the particulate component material that<br>
is to be vaporized. The utilization of such an inert carrier, with suitable mixing<br>
techniques, would allow the metering of minute quantities of a component<br>
particulate material, such as an organic particulate material, for vaporization.(Table Removed)<br><br>
