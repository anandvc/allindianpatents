Polymorph of {6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy-)-quinazolin-4-yl}-(3e)<br>
The compound [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin~4-7l]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl) amine hydrochloride of the formula (I) is useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, such as cancers, in mammals.<br><br>
In WO 96/30347, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the preparation of [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride as well as the uses of this compound have been disclosed. In particular, this compound is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase enzymes such, as epidermal growth factor receptors and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases which are associated with tyrosine kinase enzymes such as epidermal growth factor receptors, such as cancer, particularly non small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, refractor)' non small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, glioma, head cancer or neck cancer.<br>
Recently, two different polymorphs of [6,7-bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride, designated as polymorph A and polymorph B, have been disclosed in WO 01/34574, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Polymorphism is defined as the ability of a substance to crystallize in more than one crystal lattice arrangement. Polymorphism can influence many aspects of solid state properties of a drug. Different crystal modifications of a substance may differ considerably from one another in many respects such as their solubility, dissolution rate and finally bioavailability. An exhaustive treatment of polymorphism in pharmaceutical and molecular crystals is given e.g. by Byrn (Byrn, S.R., Pfeiffer, R.R., Stowell, J.G., „Solid-State Chemistry of Drugs", SSCI Inc., West Lafayette, Indiana, 1999), Brittain, H.G., ^Polymorphism in . Pharmaceutical Solids", Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, 1999) or Bernstein (Bernstein, J., Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals", Oxford University Press, 2002).<br>
CS /17.12.2003<br><br>
Of the two polymorphs described in WO 01/345 74, polymorph B is thermodynamically more stable than polymorph A, while polymorph A exhibits a better solubility and dissolution rate than polymorph B. However, based on the known polymorphs A and B of [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy~quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl) amine hydrochloride, it was still considered desirable to have a form of this compound which, while being thermodynamically more stable than polymorph A, also exhibits a better solubility and dissolution rate than polymorph B.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)~quinazolin-4-yl]-(3~ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride can exist in a third polymorphic form, designated as polymorph E, which is thermodynamically more stable than the known polymorph A and exhibits a better solubility and dissolution rate than the known polymorph B.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a novel crystalline polymorph of [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride which unexpectedly exhibit the desired increased solubility and dissolution rate with respect to polymorph B and an increased thermodynamic stability compared to polymorph A. The polymorph of the present invention will consequently have improved pharmacological properties when compared to the known polymorphs A and B.<br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions are set forth to illustrate and define the meaning and scope of the various terms used to describe the invention herein.<br>
The term crystalline polymorph" refers to a crystal modification which can be characterized by analytical methods such as e.g. X-ray powder diffraction, IR-spectroscopy or by its melting point.<br>
The term "polymorph E" relates to the crystalline polymorph of [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethnyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride of the present invention. The terms "polymorph A" and polymorph B" relate to different crystalline polymorphs of [6?7-Bis(2~methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3~ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride as described in WO 01/34574.<br>
The term „IR" means infrared.<br>

In detail, the present invention relates to a crystalline polymorph of [6,7-Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynyl--phenyl)amine hydrochloride which is characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks expressed in degrees 2-theta at approximately<br><br>
The term „approximately" means in this context that there is an uncertainty in the measurements of the degrees 2-theta of ± 0.2 (expressed in degrees 2-theta ).<br>
Preferably, the crystalline polymorph as described above is characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks expressed in degrees 2-theta as described above, which have relative intensities of approximately<br><br><br><br>
The term approximately" means in this context that there is an uncertainly in the measurements of the relative intensities.

The polymorph of the present invention can be used as medicament, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. It can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described polymorph, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 7000 mg, especially about 5 to 2500 mg, preferably 5 to 200 mg comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be<br><br>
administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-1000 mg, preferably 5-200 mg of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner. The crystalline polymorphs A and B of [6,7~Bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-quinazolin~4-yl]-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)amine hydrochloride can be obtained according to the methods disclosed in WO 01/34574.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
