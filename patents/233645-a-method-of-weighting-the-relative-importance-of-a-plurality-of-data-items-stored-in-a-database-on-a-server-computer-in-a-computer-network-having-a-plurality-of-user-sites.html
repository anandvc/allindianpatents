				<td>A METHOD OF WEIGHTING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF A PLURALITY<br>
OF DATA ITEMS STORED IN A DATABASE ON A SERVER COMPUTER<br>
IN A COMPUTER NETWORK HAVING A PLURALITY OF USER SITES.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of weighting the relative importance of a plurality of<br>
data items stored in a database on a server computer in a computer network having a plurality of user sites,<br>
and more particularly, for use as an internet search engine.<br>
An efficient and practical means of obtaining relevant information and also screening<br>
unwanted/uninteresting information has been an ongoing need, especially since the inception of the<br>
internet. This need is particularly acute at present due to the exponential growth in the number of world-<br>
wide web sites and the sheer volume of information contained therein. In an attempt to index the .<br>
information available on the internet, a number of software search engines have been created via which a<br>
user enters a search command comprised of suitable keywords from a keyboard at his personal computer.<br>
The search command is transmitted to a server computer, that has a search engine associated with the<br>
server computer. The search engine receives the search command, and then using it scars for these key<br>
words through a database of web addresses and the text stored on the web sites. Thereafter, the results of<br>
the scan are transmitted from the server computer back to the user's computer and displayed on the<br>
screen of the user's computer.<br>
In order for the search engine to be aware of new web sites and to update its records of existing<br>
sites, either the proprietors of the web sites notify the search engine themselves or the information may<br>
be obtained via a 'web crawler' to update the database at the server computer. A web crawler is an<br>
automated program which explores and records the contents of a web site and its links to other sites,<br>
thereby spreading between sites in an attempt to index all the current sites.<br>
This database structure and method of searching it poses some significant difficulties. The internet<br>
growth-rate has resulted in a substantial backlog in the scanning of new sites, notwithstanding the fact<br>
that web sites are frequently deleted, re-addressed, updated and so forth, thus leaving the search engine<br>
with outdated and/or misleading information. Although the web crawlers can be configured to prioritize<br>
possible key-words according to their location (title, embedded link, address etc), nevertheless,<br>
depending on the type of search engine used, substantial portions of the web site text (often involving the<br>
majority or even all of the site text) is still required to be scanned. This results in colossal storage<br>
requirements for the search engine. Furthermore, a typical key word search may bring up an excessively<br>
large volume of material, the majority of which may be of little interest to the user. The user typically<br>
makes a selection from the list based on the brief descriptions of the site and explores the chosen sites<br>
until the desired information is located.<br>
These results are in the form of a list, ranked according to criteria specific to the search engine.<br>
These criteria may range from the number of occurrences of the key-words anywhere within the searched<br>
text, to methods giving a weighting to key-words used in particular positions (as previously mentioned).<br>
When multiple key-words have been used, sites are also ranked according to the number of different key-<br>
words applicable. A fundamental drawback of all these ranking systems is their objectivity - they are<br>
determined according to the programmed criteria of the search engine, and the emphasis placed on<br>
particular types of site design, rather than any measure of the actual users' opinions. Indeed this can lead<br>
to the absurd situation whereby in an attempt to ensure a favorable rating by the most commonly used<br>
search, engines, some designers deliberately configure their sites in the light of the previously mentioned<br>
criteria, to the detriment of the presentation, readability and content of the site.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate the aforementioned disadvantages of<br>
conventional search engines by harnessing the cerebral power of the human operator.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel search engine with enhanced<br>
efficiency, usability and effectiveness with a reduced system storage and/or computational requirements<br>
in comparison to existing software engines.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a variety of indications of the popularity of<br>
the search data, together with an indication of its date of creation or updating.<br>
In order to obtain the above recited advantages of the present invention, among others, one<br>
embodiment of the present invention provides for a method of updating an internet search engine<br>
database with the results of a user's selection of specific web page listings from the general web page<br>
listing provided to the user as a result of his initial keyword search entry. By updating the database with<br>
the selections of many different users, the database can be updated to prioritize those web listings that<br>
have been selected the most with respect to a given keyword, and thereby presenting first the most<br>
popular web page listings in a subsequent search using the same keyword search entry.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of determining content to provide along<br>
with listings transmitted from a server computer to user sites is provided. In this embodiment, there is<br>
obtained a content listing from each one of a plurality of different developer sites. Each of the content<br>
listings includes content, a developer identifier, and a keyword, and a keyword selection factor.<br>
Thereafter, there is determined a particular keyword from the obtained keywords that is the same for<br>
different content listings. For that particular keyword, the keyword selection factor is used in<br>
determining when to transmit different content listings to the user sites.<br>
In still another embodiment, there is provided a method of updating a keyword table with the results<br>
of a user's selection of specific keywords which were obtained from a list of related keywords presented<br>
to the user. By updating the database with selections of many different users associated with that same<br>
keyword, appropriate keywords can be provided and presented first when that same keyword<br>
is subsequently entered.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of weighting the relative<br>
importance of a plurality of data items stored in a database on a server computer in a<br>
computer network having a plurality of user sites, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
receiving at said server computer one or more keywords from user sites; generating at said<br>
server computer a plurality of listings corresponding to said keyword, each listing also<br>
corresponding to one of said data items; transmitting from said server computer to one of said<br>
user sites said plurality of listings; detecting at said server computer which ones of said<br>
plurality of data items are selected by said user site, said user site being transmitted each<br>
selected one of said data items upon selection of said corresponding listing by said user site;<br>
updating said database to weight said selected ones of said data items as relatively more<br>
important than unselected ones of said data items with respect to said keyword; wherein said<br>
step of detecting only detects each keyword one time from each user site during a determined<br>
interval of time; and wherein said step of generating uses a history factor associated with each<br>
keyword in determining said plurality of listings, wherein said history factor is a number less<br>
than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 0.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of populating a database on a server<br>
computer in a computer network having a plurality of user sites and developer sites, said<br>
method comprising the steps of: entering a plurality of data items into said database from said<br>
developer sites, each of said data items entered into said database having as associated<br>
identifiers a plurality of associated keywords; updating said database by entering a plurality of<br>
user traces, each of said user traces identifying one of said data items and an associated<br>
keyword so that each trace increases the relative importance of the associated data item with<br>
respect to said associated keyword, wherein said step of updating only updates each keyword<br>
one time for each user during a determined interval of time; and wherein said step of updating<br>
each keyword one time comprises the steps of: associating an identifier with each user,<br>
wherein each of said user traces containing the user identifier, wherein said user identifier is<br>
used to update a user table; and using said identifier to track keywords that have been entered<br>
by each user.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of weighting the relative importance of<br>
a plurality of keywords stored in a database on a server computer in a computer network<br>
having a plurality of user sites, said method comprising the steps of: receiving at said server<br>
computer an initial keyword from a user site; generating at said server computer a plurality of<br>
related keywords associated with a listing said listing also being associated with the initial<br>
keyword received; transmitting from said server computer to one of said user sites said plurality<br>
of related keywords; detecting at said server computer which one of said plurality of related<br>
keywords are selected by said user site; and updating said database to weight a relationship of<br>
said selected keyword and said initial keyword greater than a relationship of said unselected<br>
keywords and said initial keywords.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of weighting the relative<br>
importance of a plurality of data items stored in a database on a server computer in a computer<br>
network having a plurality of user sites, said method comprising the steps of: receiving at said<br>
server a keyword from a user site; generating at said server computer a plurality of listings<br>
corresponding to said keyword using a history factor associated with each keyword in<br>
determining said plurality of listings; each listing also corresponding to one of said keywords;<br>
transmitting from said server computer to one of said user sites said plurality of listings;<br>
detecting at said server computer which ones of said plurality of data items are selected by<br>
said user site, said user site being transmitted each selected one of said data items upon<br>
selection of said corresponding listing by said user site; and updating said database to weight<br>
said selected ones of said data items as relatively more important than unselected ones of said<br>
data items with respect to said keyword.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of determining a percentage<br>
amount to electronically display content of a plurality of content providers to a plurality of users<br>
comprising the steps of: receiving a bid amount and an associated particular keyword from<br>
each of said plurality of content providers, said bid amount corresponding to a value that each<br>
said content provider associates with the particular keyword for displaying a piece of content;<br>
correlating the bid amounts for the same keyword to determine the percentage amount that<br>
each piece of content will be electronically displayed to said plurality of users; and displaying<br>
each said piece of content based in part upon the percentage amount.<br>
i<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of determining a percentage<br>
amount to electronically display content of a plurality of content providers to a plurality of users<br>
comprising the steps of: receiving a bid amount and an associated profile from each of said<br>
plurality of content providers, said bid amount corresponding to a value that each said content<br>
provider associates with the particular keyword for displaying a piece of content; correlating all<br>
of the bid amounts for the same profile to determine the percentage amount that each piece of<br>
content will be electronically displayed to said plurality of users; and displaying each said piece<br>
of content based upon the percentage amount.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of determining which one content<br>
to electronically display to one user from among a plurality of different contents provided by<br>
content providers comprising the steps of: receiving a bid amount from each of said plurality of<br>
content providers, said bid amount corresponding to a value for displaying a piece of content<br>
that each said content provider associates with at least a keyword or a profile of a group of<br>
users; correlating all of the bid amounts to the different keywords and profiles for each different<br>
bid amount so that it is possible to determine which one content has the highest percentage<br>
amount for each of the different keywords and profiles; receiving one keyword from one user<br>
who falls within said profile of the group of users; transmitting to the one user the one piece of<br>
content that has the highest corresponding bid amount based upon that one keyword and the<br>
profile of the user.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figs. 1A and IB illustrate certain of the overall features of the present invention, which will be<br>
described in further detail hereinafter. It is initially noted that like- numbered reference numerals in<br>
various Figures and descriptions will be used in the following descriptions to refer to the same or similar<br>
structures, actions or process steps.<br>
The present invention is preferably implemented in a network environment wherein each<br>
computer contains, typically, a microprocessor, memory, and modem, and certain of the computers<br>
contain displays and the like, as are well known. As shown in Fig. IB, a plurality of user<br>
sites/computers 100A-100D are shown, as are a plurality of server computers 102A-B, and developer<br>
sites/computers 104A-B. It is understood that in a typical internet network, that different server<br>
computers 102 can be interconnected together, as is illustrated. Further, while only a few user sites,<br>
developer sites and server computers are shown, it is understood that thousands of such computers are<br>
interconnected together.<br>
While the specific embodiments of the present invention are written for applications in which the<br>
invention is implemented as sequences of coded program instructions operated upon by a server<br>
computer 102 as illustrated, it will be understood that certain sequences of these program instructions<br>
could instead be implemented in other forms, such as processors having specific instructions specifically<br>
tailored for the applications described hereinafter.<br>
As will be illustrated hereinafter, additional operations, transparent to the user, are implemented in<br>
order to obtain search results in the future based upon currently made searches. As shown, the present<br>
invention has various capabilities, each of which are illustrated in a parallel flow in Fig. 1A, which<br>
illustrates an overview of the different capabilities that can be ongoing simultaneously. In terms of<br>
overall capabilities, start block 10 show three: suggesting web pages 12, suggesting keywords 14, and<br>
content suggestion 16.<br>
In order for web pages 12 to be selected by a user according to the present invention, there is a step<br>
18 in which the type of search to be performed is selected. Thereafter, in step 20, search input obtained<br>
from one of a variety of sources is input and used along with the algorithm selected in step 18 to<br>
determine search results. The results of this search are then displayed to the user, as shown by steps of<br>
displaying a created list of web pages, displaying passively suggested web pages, and displaying actively<br>
suggested web pages, identified as steps 22, 24, and 26, respectively, in Figure 1. This capability, and<br>
how it is implemented, will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In order for keyword suggestion to take place, which the user may or may not select, there is<br>
preferably an initial step 28 in which the type of keyword search algorithm to use is selected. Although<br>
many systems may have only one such algorithm, various ones, as described hereinafter, are possible.<br>
Once the keyword search algorithm is selected, step 30 follows in which, based upon a keyword entered<br>
by a user, the current set of keyword data is operated upon to determine associated keywords. The results<br>
of this operation are then displayed to the user in 30. This capability, and how it is implemented, will be<br>
described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
The previously mentioned web page and keyword selection capabilities inured to the direct benefit of<br>
the end user. Another novel feature of the present invention, which indirectly inures to the benefit of the<br>
end user, directly benefits the advertiser, because it allows for content to be targeted in real time based<br>
upon various criteria. As will be described more fully hereinafter, a content providing algorithm is<br>
initially selected which will determine how content is selected in step 34. Step 36 follows, and based<br>
upon inputs from users and content providers, which content to show is determined. Thereafter, the<br>
advertisements are displayed for the user to see, simultaneously with the display of either keywords<br>
and/or web pages<br>
While Fig 1 illustrates certain overall features according to the present invention, many of the<br>
advantageous features of the present invention are not, as mentioned previously, observable to the user,<br>
but instead transparent to user. They are, however, significant in order to fully explain how the present<br>
invention is implemented and are explained hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 2 is provided to illustrate various inputs to the search engine according to the present invention,<br>
and, for different capabilities, illustrates the outputs that will be provided. More detailed explanations are<br>
provided hereinafter. Data that is potentially input from search engine user include:<br>
• keyword 52 - this is the word or phrase that the user enter to find a list of web pages<br>
• profile types 54 - these are the groups of people they associate them selves with e.g. US, male,<br>
doctor etc.<br>
• user ID 56 - this is a unique identification for each user that chooses to register with the search<br>
engine. This can be done via a cookie or logon.<br>
• search type 58 - this can be actively chosen by the searcher to determine the type of search results<br>
they would like (popular, new, etc)<br>
• date-time 60 - this is passively recorded when a searcher uses the system<br>
• IP address 62 - this is passively recorded when a searcher uses the system<br>
• other 64 - this includes other personalization information such as search customization preferences,<br>
keywords for web page suggestion etc. This information is entered actively once by the user then<br>
used to personalize the search results each time the users (identified by user ID) uses the search<br>
engine.<br>
Data from web-page developers include:<br>
• URL 66 - this is the URL address of the web page or pages that they wish to submit<br>
• description 68 - this is a 2-3 line description of the information on their web-page<br>
• keywords 70 - these are the keywords that the web page developer would like to associate their web-<br>
page with<br>
• target audience 72 - these are the target audience (profile types 54) that the web page developer<br>
particularly want to target.<br>
• date-time 74 - this is passively recorded when every a web-page developer submits a web page<br>
Data from content providers include:<br>
• bids 76 - these are S bids for content as described later.<br>
• content details 78 -this includes all details of content providers including address, content details<br>
etc.<br>
Results from other search engines 80 - these are the results for a keyword search from other existing<br>
search engines.<br>
Outputs of the search engine 10 are:<br>
lists of web pages 90 - depending on the input data a list of web pages can be produced in web page<br>
determination step 82, described further hereinafter;<br>
content keywords 92 - the search engine suggests other keywords for users to try produced in key word<br>
determination step 84, described further hereinafter; and<br>
content 94 - the search engine sends out selected content as produced in determine content step 86,<br>
described further hereinafter<br>
To facilitate ease of reference and aid understanding, the aforementioned and subsequently mentioned<br>
data-set definitions are reiterated and expanded upon below (and where appropriate, the structure of the<br>
dependant data-sets used to create the defined data-set are shown in tabular form) with reference to the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Thereafter, certain of these will be explained in even<br>
greater detail to fully teach how to make and use the present invention.<br>
Locations: a plurality of unique information entities.<br>
Web-pages: Locations in the form of Web-pages URL (Universal Reference Locator) addresses.<br>
Key-word: The word or phrase that is entered in the search engine<br>
Hit-list: The list of web-pages (URL addresses) that is the result of the key-word search. This hit-list<br>
ranks the relevance of the web-pages relative to the key-word. This hit-list always has a key-word<br>
associated with it.<br><br>
Permanent data set: Retained long term (although it changes over time<br>
Temporary data set: Created only for the duration of the search<br>
Surfer trace: This is a measure of how users search. It is a trace of the key words they search for, the<br>
URLs subsequently selected and how long they spend there, from which a ranking of web-pages for a<br>
users (surfers) can be calculated. It is a measure of which web-pages they found most useful after the<br>
key-word search. The combination of all surfer traces is used to create a users' choice hit-list.<br>
Content Provider's list: This is a list (associated with each key-word) of content providers which must<br>
typically that pay to illustrate content with the key-word. The price paid is dependent on the number of<br>
other content providers, the amount they spend and the number of times the key word is searched for.<br>
Users' choice hit-list: This a semi-permanent ranking of web-pages associated with every key-word and<br>
indicates how useful Internet users found each of the web-pages associated with the key-word. The users'<br>
choice hit-list is incrementally updated by a new surfer trace.<br>
Crawler key-word list: This is a list of key-word suggestions that the user may find useful. This is found<br>
by matching the key-word entered by the user to the database of key-words and phrases that other users<br>
have tried. This is the equivalent of the crawler hit-list, though it is a ranking of key-words rather than<br>
Web-pages. The method for doing this uses a similar algorithm to a spell-checker only it does it for<br>
phrases. It also suggest Key-words, based on previous URL selections from sequences of user key-words.<br>
The discussion provided above provides the language necessary to more fully describe the<br>
present invention. As illustrated in Figs. 3A and 3B, which provide an overview of the search engine<br>
capabilities according to the present invention in which web pages are selected in making up the search<br>
results provided to the end user. In step 112, the user enters up to 4 sets of data: keyword 52, profile<br>
type 54, search type 58 and User ID 56. The IP address 62 and date-time 60 are not entered by the user<br>
but can be read when a user uses the search engine. This data is used is used in parallel in steps 114 and<br>
116 to produce list of web pages. Step 114, discussed in detail hereinafter, is the process of selecting web<br>
pages from novel new search engine data sets produced in accordance with the present invention. This<br>
can run, if desired, in parallel with step 116 which obtains a selection of web pages from other existing<br>
search engines. Thereafter, selection of web pages from step 114 and 116 are combined and tagged in<br>
step 118. The process of tagging the list of web pages, described in more detail below, enables a set of<br>
data, shown as surfer trace data in Fig. 3, to be created and sent back to the search engine when the<br>
search engine user selects a web-page from the list in step 120. The process of selecting a tagged web-<br>
page creates the following series of data which is used to update the search engine data sets;,keyword 124<br>
, URL 126, user ID 128, IP address 130, date-time 132, brief web page description 134.<br>
Although it is preferred to use all of these different data types in the surfer trace data, use of<br>
different combinations of this data is fully within the intended scope of the present invention. The<br>
description 134 will typically only be included in the preferred embodiment of the invention when a new<br>
site is added to the data set 114 of the search engine 10, and the description used will be that description<br>
that appears on the original list of web pages. The date-time data 132 may only indicate that a site was<br>
selected, rather than record the period of time a user was at a particular site, as explained further<br>
hereinafter. This process is invisible to the user who, upon selecting the web-page from the list of web<br>
pages is taken directly to the corresponding URL, step 122. Details of the implementation of steps 114,<br>
118 and 120 will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
After the initial selection the user may choose to access another of the web-page URL search<br>
results. Depending on the relevance of the site, the user may spend time reading, downloading, exploring<br>
further pages, embedded links and so forth, or if the site appears irrelevant/uninteresting, the user may<br>
return directly back to the search results after a short period. The time difference between the two<br>
selections is recorded as the difference between two date/time data 132 from subsequent selections from<br>
the list of web page searches (in this embodiment, one can only measure the time spent at one web page<br>
if another selection is made after visiting that web page - this then provides another surfer trace 132<br>
which allow a time difference to be calculated). This surfer trace data on the popularity of web pages is<br>
used to rank the subsequent searches, as described further hereinafter.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, it is the human users' powers of reasoning and analysis<br>
that is being used to establish the relevance of the different results to the subject matter of the search.<br>
The present invention utilizes the cumulative processing and reasoning of all the human users' to provide<br>
a vastly more effective means of obtaining the required information sources than is presently possible<br>
with the type of method described above.<br>
As described above, human brain power is captured by recording which web pages the user goes<br>
to after each keyword search. According to the present invention, collecting the surfer trace data is<br>
achieved by sending, in the list of web pages generated by the search to the user, hidden links that will<br>
automatically send information back to the search engine (or a subsidiary server). While the user only<br>
sees that his intended link is displayed, the hidden link notifies the search engine of the transfer, which<br>
process can be executed with a Java applet. Thus, when the Internet user selects a web-page it takes the<br>
user to that address but also sends off a the surfer trace data to the search engine 10, which notes what<br>
has been selected. When the user returns to the list of web pages and selects another web page listing,<br>
another Java applet is then executed which creates another surfer trace. The difference between the data<br>
time data in this surfer trace from two sequential selections captures the time period that the user has<br>
been at the previous web site. This occurs without the user knowing this data is being sent.<br>
In another embodiment, rather than using multiple Java applets to collect a complete list of surfer<br>
trace data, there is no description data 134, and the date-time data 132 indicates that a user visited a<br>
particular web site. In one specific embodiment, the user must visit a particular web site for greater than<br>
a predetermined period of time, such as one minute or fifteen minutes, depending on what is an<br>
appropriate time to have looked at the site for the visit to the site to count and for any surfer trace data to<br>
be sent back to the search engine 10, as well be described hereinafter. In this embodiment, each applet<br>
contains all of the information necessary to update the database at the search engine. Another<br>
embodiment collects the surfer trace data prior to a user navigating to the intended web site. Other ways<br>
of obtaining this surfer trace data are possible and are within the intended scope of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the search results page according to the present invention is therefore differently formatted<br>
from conventional search engines' results pages. The difference is in action rather than content. Visually,<br>
the page looks the same to the user as standard search results from other search engines.<br>
An example illustrates this point: In a conventional search, the results page for a search of the keyword<br>
"Weather" may read: 1. www.weather.com Today's weather forecast. Today is expected to be fine and<br>
sunny everywhere.<br>
The HTTP link associated with the "www.weather.com" label is "http://www.weather.com". This means<br>
that if the user selects this link, they will navigate to this page directly<br>
In contrast, according to the present invention, the tagged result page for the search made suing<br>
the keyword "Weather" may read<br>
1. www.weather.com Today's weather forecast. Today is expected to be fine and sunny everywhere.<br>
The HTTP link associated with the "www.weathcr.com" label is "link.asp?n=l." If the user selects<br>
this link, therefore, in a process is invisible to the user, the user is first directed to the link.asp page on the<br>
site corresponding to the web server using the search engine 10 according to the present invention, and<br>
pass parameter n with value 1.<br>
Server side code (application code that runs on the web server) uses this parameter to identify the<br>
URL and description of the user's chosen site. This information is then stored in a database Table along<br>
with other surfer trace data. The server side code then executes a redirect operation to the user's required<br>
URL. The user then sees their required page appear.<br>
The source of search results is independent to this activity. The destination page of the user is<br>
independent of this activity. The process is one of recording a user, keyword and destination into a<br>
database. This method of tracking can only record the initial web-page visited after a keyword search. If<br>
the user continues to return to the search results list then subsequent web-page visits can be recorded.<br>
The surfer trace data that is sent back to the data sets 114 of the search engine 10 as a result of the<br>
user selecting the web-page can be encrypted to prevent fraudulent users from sending fake data to the<br>
search engine.<br>
Another method of tracking where a user may connect to from an initial URL selection (if they do<br>
not return to the search result page) is to run the selected web-pages as part of a 'frame' located at the<br>
search engine web-site. This permits a complete record of the web pages visited to be recorded after a<br>
keyword is entered. However, this imposes an additional level of complexity to the system with a<br>
possible decrease in system response time.<br>
As previously mentioned, the surfer trace data that can be collected includes keyword 124 , URL<br>
126, user ID 128, IP address 130, date-time 132, brief web page description 134, and is identified as such<br>
since it provides a trace or record of how searchers (surfers) use the search engine. This data is used to<br>
improve future searches building on the preferences of previous searchers. The surfer trace is thus a<br>
measure of the preferred choices of an individual user or web 'surfers' from the initial search results for a<br>
particular set of key-words.How the data sets are created that determine the list of web pages<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the data sets used Tor different web-page searches according to the present<br>
invention. The data sets (tables) that are used to determine the list if web pages include keyword table<br>
164, profile ID table 166, security table 168, cumulative surfer trace table 170, keyword URL link table<br>
172, personal link table 174, and web-page (URL) table 188.<br>
The structure of the aforementioned data sets are described in more detail hereinafter. The<br>
descriptions that follow show the data arranged in a spreadsheet fashion, with multiple values per cell<br>
and many blank cells. Illustration in this manner is convenient for explaining the present invention, but is<br>
not an efficient storage and retrieval method. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, a relational<br>
database model would be used to implement the data storage according to the present invention such that<br>
there may be multiple fields or Tables involved to store the data and each field will store only one value.<br>
Keyword Table (164)<br>
The contents of keyword data table 164 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 1 shown below, and<br>
is a list of keywords, including phrases, and the number of times they have been requested. If the list<br>
becomes unmanageably large, the key-words that are not used again after a predetermined time period<br>
could be deleted from the list. However is would be desirable to keep the majority or all keyword phrases<br>
that are entered, if possible.<br><br>
Table 1 List of information requests and the number of times it is requests<br>
The cumulative number of times a keyword is requested may be segregated according to the different<br>
"users profiles" selected (Wl, W2, W3, ....), e.g. Wl = total searches, W2= male profile, W3 = Female<br>
profile , W4 = USA profile and so forth. It should be noted that the sum of W's will be greater that the<br>
total number of times a site has been visited because the user may fall into more than one profile category<br>
e.g. a male-(W2) from the USA (W3). This would become a list of not only the number of user searchers<br>
using that key-word but also a list of the type of user (according to the profile type selected) searching<br>
for that keyword. Keywords that mean the same thing in different languages are different keywords, as<br>
long as the spelling is different, although they could be related using the keyword suggester, as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Web-page Table (188)<br>
The contents of .web-page table 188 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 2 shown below, and<br>
contains a list of Internet web-pages. Each web-page has a URL address, an associated 2-3 line<br>
description, a unique web page number for each URL(which can also be any character, symbol code or<br>
representation) and the cumulative number of times the URL has been visited. The URL address will<br>
have a unique number (which can also be any character, symbol code or representation) assigned to it<br>
rather than storing the full URL string in the subsequent data-Tables.<br>
Keyword URL link Table (172) <br>
The contents of keyword URL link table 172 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 3 shown below.<br>
This table is of particular significance with respect to the present invention because it contains<br>
information about the links between information supplies (URL addresses or web pages) and information<br>
requests (keywords).<br>
This data is recorded in further data sets which describes the relationship between the key-words and<br>
occurrences as defined by the following three parameters.<br>
- the cumulative number of significant visits (hits) to each URL addresses corresponding to each key-<br>
word (herein referred to as X or weighting factor X). This is a measure of the popularity of the URL<br>
for each keyword and is determine from the surfer traces.<br>
- the previous cumulative number of significant visits measured at an earlier predetermined instant;<br>
(herein referred to as Y or weighting factor Y)<br>
- a date time factor relating to the instant of the creation or input of each said web-page(herein referred<br>
to as Z or weighting factor Z). Z is the data time in which a web-page developer submitted a web-page<br>
to the search engine.<br>
Not all combinations of key-words and URL addresses will have data for X, Y and Z.<br>
In this example the global popularity (using the general profile type ) for the Rugby and Basketball URL<br>
addresses are 520 and 4000 respectively and 52 and 20 respectively for the New Zealand profile type .<br>
When the general profile type setting is used (ranked based on X1), the Basketball site would be<br>
ranked at the top. When the New Zealand setting is chosen (ranked based on X2) the rugby site would be<br>
highest. This would be a reflection of the preferences of the New Zealanders. This is a very simple<br>
method of storing the preference of different groups of people.<br>
One would expect New Zealand-based rugby web-sites to rate higher than an overseas site on the<br>
New Zealand list, but there is no reason that this has to be the case. Someone in Spain may have the best<br>
Rugby site in the world. The system evaluates web-pages only on the perceived quality of information<br>
by the users -the physical location of the site is immaterial.<br>
There could be a vast range of X values representing different countries, occupations, sex , age and<br>
so forth, enabling, the popularity of different groups to be captured very simply. Users could choose to<br>
combine any of the X values according to their personal interests/characteristics.<br>
As an example, if say,<br>
• X1 is for males<br>
• X2 is for females<br>
• X3 is for New Zealanders<br>
• X4 is for USA<br>
• X5 is for engineers<br>
• X6 is for lawyers ...<br>
A "male" and a "New Zealander" would using the search engine increment both X3 and XL This facility<br>
would increase the data requirement of the system but it could vastly improve the search results for<br>
different users. The total popularity of the web-page needs to be stored as a separate number as users may<br>
contribute to more than one of the groups of people. The sum of all of the individual popularity's would<br>
be greater than the total popularity because user can belong to more than one profile type.<br>
To simplify the system for the user there would be a default profile type (selection of X's) with an<br>
option is to use other profile type s to do specific searches. For example, a user may have a default profile<br>
type of a New Zealand male, but if a technical search is required a "global engineers" profile type may<br>
be chosen that reflects the cumulative search knowledge of engineers around the world.<br>
The extent of personalization could be dependent on the frequency of searching. For example,<br>
common keywords such as "news" would .have a high degree of personalization (a large range of X<br>
values) and less common key-word such as "English stamps" would have little or no personalization<br>
(only a global X value). The degree of personalization could be a function of the frequency that the key-<br>
word is used (found from Table 1).<br>
Cumulative surfer trace Table (170)<br>
The contents of cumulative surfer trace table 170 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 4<br>
shown below. Information about the links between web pages and keywords in Table 3 ( also referred to<br>
as keyword URL link table 172) is updated by the surfer trace data. The cumulative surfer trace is the<br>
combined information from all individual surfer traces and it is used to determine how many "hits"<br>
(significant visits) each web-page had for each key-word.<br>
The information collected from each individual surfer trace is a series of inputs previously described, and<br>
shown below in Table form<br>
The users default profile type is stored as the part of the user's personal preferences profile, which<br>
would accessed by entering some form of personal identification to the system. This information could<br>
be supplied when logging on to the data search engine or the search engine could leave a "cookie", as<br>
that term is known in the art, on the computer to identify a user, (there would be an optional e-mail<br>
address and password (or similar) associated with the logon procedure). The IP address itself would not<br>
be a sufficient means of identification as it is not necessarily unique to the individual users.<br>
The other information can include user defined preferences for how the search results are combined<br>
and keywords that are of particular interest to the user. This information can be used to actively<br>
customize the search results and suggestions of web pages to visit.<br>
Personal link Table (174)<br>
The contents of personal link table 174 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 6 shown below.<br>
Table 6 is identical in structure as Table 3, and can be used to record a users personal preferences relating<br>
to each URL including the number of times visited and the key-words. In this Table 6, however, Z is not<br>
the date that the web-page developer submitted the web-page by it is the date-time that the user visited<br>
The data in Table 6 is only accessed by the individual that created it, and accessible using a user ID<br>
that is preferably independent of changes in the user's e-mail or IP address changes and would thus<br>
enable their past personal preferences to be retained during such changes.<br>
This Table 6 data set could be stored either at the search engine site or on an individual's computer.<br>
Storing on local PC's would require additional software to be installed on the users computer. There are<br>
numerous advantages to storing the information at the search engine including the fact that users are<br>
likely to go there more often and unlikely to change search engines once they have a substantial book<br>
mark list.<br>
Security Table (168)<br>
The contents of security table 168 of Fig. 4 are shown in more detail in Table 7 shown below. To<br>
ensure that users do not submit the same key-word over and over to increase its popularity the following<br>
security data table is used. Each entry is a single piece of information i.e. yes or no. This table can be<br>
created for links between keywords and IP addresses or links between keywords and User ID's.<br>
Key-word 1 Key-word 2 Key-word 3 Key-word 4<br>
IP address 1 1<br>
IP address 2 1<br>
Described hereinafter are the processes that are used by the present invention to populate each of the Fig.<br>
4 tables mentioned previously.<br>
Populating the keyword Table 164<br>
This table is populated every time a user enters a keyword 52 to the search engine. A submitted<br>
keyword is compared to the keyword list in Table 1 (keyword table 164) and added if it is not already<br>
present. If it is present, the cumulative number is increased by one. If the user has a profile type then the<br>
cumulative number for the keyword for each type of profile will also be incremented (W1,W2 W3 etc).<br>
Populating the web-page data Table (URL Table) 188<br>
This table is populated in a number of ways, including:<br>
• user selecting a URL address 126 that is not already in Table 2 (URL table 188). The URL<br>
address 126 and description 134 are put directly into the web-page data table 188. The new<br>
URL is assigned a unique identification number.<br>
• in Step 176, as shown in Fig. 4, web-page developers can submit a URL 187 and description<br>
68 which also goes directly into the web-page data table 188,<br>
• web crawlers may also add URL addresses and descriptions (the description is either the first<br>
few lines of the web-page or in the HTML coded "title"). This is not an essential element of the<br>
system but it could be a method to obtain URL's and descriptions. With this search system web<br>
crawlers are more likely to be used to verify the information rather than find new information.<br>
Populating the cumulative surfer trace Table 170<br>
The cumulative surfer trace table 170, also referred to above as Table 4, is populated each time a<br>
"tagged" web-page is selected by a user. This sends a packet of surfer trace information, such that the<br>
surfer trace data is added to the table each time the user selects another web page from a web page list.<br>
Populating the keyword URL link Table 172<br>
The data from the cumulative surfer trace 170 is used to update the popularity of web pages as recorded in Table 3<br>
(X,Y), also referred to as the keyword URL link table 172. The frequency of updating Table 3 with the data from<br>
the cumulative surfer trace (170) to obtain new values of X and Y is a variable that can be changed, from ranges<br>
that are shorter than every hour to longer than every month. It should be noted that different keywords can be<br>
updated at different intervals of time.<br>
An intermediary step in processing the cumulative surfer trace is to form a cumulative surfer hit<br>
table. This is subsequently used to modify the values of and X,Y in Table 3<br>
As mentioned above, the simplest method of recording a link ("useful visit" or "hit") between a<br>
keyword and a URL would be to count each keyword, URL paring in a surfer trace as a "hit". A more<br>
meaningful and sophisticated method is only to count a location selection as a valid if the user meets<br>
certain criteria. This criterion could be the user exceeding a specified time at a location. If this criterion<br>
was not met, the selection would not be increase the cumulative value of X in Table 3.<br>
It is also possible to increment the value of X based on the time spent at the web page. The longer<br>
the time spent the more this increments the value of X. X does not have to be a whole number.<br>
Due to the variations in web-site capabilities in terms of log-on times, down loading times,<br>
bandwidth, and response times, the predetermined time used to denote a valid 'hit' may be suitably<br>
altered. Specialist web crawlers may be employed to independently validate such data.<br>
The selection of a content provider's banner after a keyword search counts as a hit for their web-<br>
page (increment the value of X). This will enable their web pages to possibly go up the popularity list<br>
associated with the keyword. This acts as a mechanism to enable a web-page developer to pay to be seen<br>
with a keyword. They can not pay to go up the popularity list - this will only occur if people visit their<br>
site and spend time there and record a valid hit for the popular list. The values of a content hit can vary<br>
(e.g. if could be 1 or 0.5 or 7) depending on the emphasis one wants to place how much that content<br>
affects the popularity ranking.<br>
This cumulative surfer trace information can be processed in a large number of ways to populate<br>
Table 8 (below). Grouping the cumulative surfer trace according to the IP addresses or user ID produces<br>
the search pattern for an individual users. This is a list of key-words and URLs and times. This allow the<br>
time spent at each web-page to be calculated for each user (it is not possible to calculated the time spent<br>
at the last web pages of a search session as there is no time record after they go to that web page)<br>
If the time between each visit is longer than a certain time period, one is added to the cumulative<br>
surfer hit (a) table for the key-word URL. (this is the simplest method, methods in which relevancy is<br>
proportional to the time spent at the site, for example, are also properly within the scope of the present<br>
invention).<br>
The cumulative surfer hit is used to update the value X in Table 3 in the following way<br>
X (new) = (X (old) . HF )+ a.<br>
HF is the history factor which is a number between 0 and 1. The history factor does not have to be the<br>
same for every key-word and could be varied depending on the rate at which the keyword is used.<br>
The data collected for Table 8 is used to recalculate the values of X in Table 3 after a predetermined<br>
time period. The frequency of updating Table 3 will influence the value of the History factor (HF)<br>
chosen. The reason for multiplying the existing X by a "history factor" is so that the perceived<br>
popularity does not last indefinitely. The history factor reduces the weighting attached to the past<br>
popularity. To illustrate by way of an example, the key-word "sports news" may have an existing<br>
popularity with the following ranking (based on the number of hits per web-page, X)<br><br>
The reason for the change in the number of hits reflects the fact that the winter Olympics has finished and<br>
the Master golf tournament has started. If one has a "history factor" of 0.9 then the new popularity (X)<br>
will be:<br>
1 Golf news web-page 18100 (0.9 x 15000+4600)<br>
2 Soccer results web-page 18000 (0.9x18000+1800)<br>
3 Winter Olympics web-page 17600 (0.9 x 19000+500)<br>
4 Baseball results web-page 15000 (0.9 xl5000+1500)<br>
Thus, the more popular web-pages can emerge and the less popular decline, reflecting the fluctuation of<br>
interest over time in different subjects and events.<br>
The database is therefore utilizing the human mind to provide a powerful indication of what people<br>
find useful on the Internet. The users themselves replace a substantial computation requirement that<br>
would otherwise be required to filter through such searches.<br>
The value of Y in Table 3 is the old value of X, and the value of Y will be updated at intervals that<br>
are deemed appropriate, which interval could be minutes, hours, days, weeks or longer. The update<br>
interval does not need to be the same for all different keywords, as previously mentioned. This is used<br>
to calculate the rate of change of popularity of web pages and can be used as a selection criteria.<br>
Different profile type s in the web-page/URL link Table<br>
The cumulative surfer trace includes information on users profiles so Table 8 can be calculated with<br>
subscripted values of a for different profile types. These values of a13 a2 a3 etc would correspond to the<br>
profile types for the subscripted values of X. This allows the popularity of different groups of people to<br>
be recorded.<br>
New web-page data input to the web-page/URL link Table 172<br>
The simplest method of having new pages recorded by the search engines is for web-page<br>
developers to submit information, shown as action 176 in Fig. 4, which information includes URL 66,<br>
key-words 70, site descriptions 68, target audience 72 and date-time 74, each time they create or update a<br>
web-page.<br>
This information directly updates Tables 2 (URL table 188 of Fig. 4) and 3 (Keyword URL link table<br>
172 of Fig. 4). The URL 66 and description 68 are entered in Table 2 and the date-time (74) at which the<br>
page is submitted (the Z value) is inserted in Table 3 for each of the key-words (70). Users are allowed a<br>
set number of keywords 70 with which they can submit their web page. An example of what Table 3<br>
would look like with just Z values is given below (format dd-mm-yy).<br>
If there is no date for the combination of the URL and keyword in Table 3, then the new date is<br>
automatically inserted. If a date already exists in the Table, then the dates are compared and if the dates<br>
are too close, i.e. less than a pre-determined period, then the old date remains and the new date is<br>
ignored. This stops people from constantly resubmitting to get on the top of the new web page list by<br>
resubmitting their web pages. If the URL in Table 3 has other keywords with values of Z closer than the<br>
pre-determined period then the submission is also not allowed. This stops web-page developers from<br>
resubmitting their web pages with different sets of keywords.<br>
When users submit a URL. they could target it at specific types of users (different profile type s Zl,<br>
22, Z3 etc) as per Table 3. For example, an URL submission specifically targeted at New Zealanders<br>
(e.g. Zl) will appear at the top of keyword new list when New Zealanders search for that keyword. It<br>
will remain at the top until someone else submits a URL for that keyword targeted at New Zealanders.<br>
URL's that are targeted at other audiences will not appear as new sites for New Zealanders or<br>
alternatively they will not feature as high in the new list as the ones specifically targeted at New<br>
Zealanders.<br>
The data on new web pages does not necessarily have to be entered by web-page developers. It .<br>
could be automated by having a web document template that automatically submits data to the search<br>
engine whenever the information on the web-page has been significantly changed. It would prompt the<br>
web-page developer to change any key-words as appropriate.<br>
Another embodiment requires sending specialist crawlers out to find web site addresses and key-<br>
words, though this has many of the drawbacks of existing web-crawlers. It could only be effective if web<br>
designers deliberately configured their page with the key-words identified. Any web site<br>
designer/proprietor willing to do this would also presumably be willing to submit any updates to the<br>
search engine to benefit from the instantaneous listing on the search results.<br>
An extension of this principle is to auto-detect if a web address possessed key-word information in<br>
the database and then automatically send an invitation to provide the information to enable their web-<br>
page to be found easily. The ideal number of key-words to be submitted with each web-page is<br>
preferably less than 50 and probably preferable within the range of about 5 and 20. This also<br>
advantageously forces web-site designers to find the most appropriate keywords to describe their site and<br>
also enable them to choose the audience they wish to target.<br>
The web-page submission process may also include web-page developer identification process that<br>
restricts the ability of people to use the system fraudulently. This may include a payment to prevent<br>
multiple web-page submissions.<br>
Populating the profile ID Table 166<br>
ID table 166 of Fig. 4 is populated from the direct inputs from users. When users search the can<br>
choose their profile type 54 from a layered drop down menu, which could include, for example:<br>
• Gender (Male or Female)<br>
• Occupation (Professional, student etc)<br>
• Age category etc<br>
The user selects different profile types from the options they are prompted if they wish to save this as<br>
their default profile type. This is then recorded in Table 5 (profile ID's table 166). The user may also<br>
select personalization options from a specific personalization options page rather than a drop down menu<br>
on the search page.<br>
Populating the personal link Table 174<br>
The cumulative surfer trace is used to identify the search patterns of individual users based of<br>
sorting by User ID 126. This information is used to update the personal link table 174 in the same way<br>
that the cumulative surfer trace 170 is used to update Table 3 (keyword URL link table 172). This table<br>
stores users past preferences as a form of automatic book marking.<br>
Populating the security Table 168<br>
Each time a user enters a keyword 52 into the search engine it updates the security table 168 (Table<br>
7) by making a link between the keyword 52 and the IP address 62 (or making a link between the<br>
keyword 52 and the User ID 56). The data in Table 7 is cleared periodically as the purpose is to stop<br>
systematic repeat searching from affecting the popularity lists (value of X in Table 3) rather than<br>
stopping individuals who occasionally perform the a repeat keyword search from affecting the popularity<br>
list.<br>
Determining the list of web pages<br>
Fig 5 shows the various data sets previously described, and various inputs and actions that result in a<br>
list of suggested web pages being provided, and will be described in more detail hereinafter. As shown in<br>
Fig. 5, user data entered into the search engine can include: keyword 52, user ID 56, search type 58, IP<br>
address 62 , profile types 54. How this data can be used to determine a list of web pages 250 as well and<br>
deciding which of the list of web pages to tag (step 118 of Fig. 3) for the purposes of creating a surfer<br>
trace is described hereinafter.<br>
The numbers (X, Y and Z) in Table 3, which correspond to keyword URL link table 172 in Fig. 5<br>
contain all the information required to give the following types of searches 58:<br>
• Popular-list search ranked hit-list of the most popular URLs for that keyword based on the number X<br>
• Hot off the press search ranked hit-list of newest URLs for the keyword based on the date/time (Z)<br>
• High-flyers search ranked hit-list of best emerging URLs based the difference between X and Y<br>
• Random search hit-list that is a random sample of URLs that have any of the numbers X, Y or Z<br>
• Date created search this is hit-list based on the date time Z and the user-specified date of interest (not<br>
just the newest)<br>
The personal links table 174 also allows past preferences to be listed as search results<br>
• Previous favorites search is a ranked hit-list base on the previous popularity for the individual (X from<br>
Table 6). This search is based only on the previous searching of the individual user. This allows the<br>
users to very quickly find site that they have previously visited.<br>
A number of other search options are also available.<br>
• Conventional search is the list of search results from a normal search engine (116 Fig 3)<br>
• Other content only search. This is a list of other content, such as advertisements, associated with the<br>
key-word.<br>
These search results can be combined in a number of different ways<br>
• Collective search ranked hit-list that is a collection of any of the search hit-lists described above (this<br>
is the default set of search results)<br>
• Customized search ranked hit-list that can be a user defined combination of any of the above lists.<br>
Fig. 5 also illustrates the use of keyword table 164 and security table 168 in a decision 246 to send<br>
out tagged web pages. This decision is based upon the frequency of key word usage, the data in the<br>
security table and the presence of a user identification. The details of the decision to send out tagged web<br>
pages is described fully in figure 16.<br>
How the different types of search lists are implemented<br>
More details on how each of these types of searches is implemented is provided below along with<br>
some of the advantage and disadvantages of each. The system relies on the brain power of the user, this<br>
time to determine what sort of search they want to do which will depend on what they want to find. The<br>
search methods are described easily so users should intuitively know which one to use.<br>
Popular search.<br>
Fig 6 illustrates the process for determining a list of popular web pages associated with the entry of<br>
a keyword 270 in step 272. If this search is selected and a keyword is entered, step 274 follows and<br>
produces a list of web pages based on the values of X taken from Table 3 (172, Fig 5) for the keyword<br>
270 entered. These web pages are identified by a unique web-page(URL) number from Table 3.<br>
Thereafter, in step 276 the list of web-page numbers found from step 274 is combined with the URL<br>
address and web-page description from Table 2 (188 Fig 5). In step 278 the resulting list of web pages is<br>
then tagged, depending on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as described previously, and sent to the user for<br>
them to make their selections.Hot off the press search.<br>
Fig 7 illustrates the process for determining a list of new web pages associated with the keyword<br>
entered in step 290. If this search is selected and a keyword is entered, step 294 follows and produces a<br>
list of web pages based on the values of Z taken from Table 3 (keyword URL link table 172 of Fig. 5) for<br>
the keyword entered in step 290. These web pages are identified by a unique web-page (URL) number<br>
from Table 3. Thereafter, in step 296 the list of web-page numbers found from step 294 is combined with'<br>
the URL address and web-page description from Table 2 (URL table 188 of Fig. 5). In step 298 the<br>
resulting list of web pages is then tagged depending on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as described<br>
previously, and sent to the user for them to make their selections.<br>
The user will also be able to see exactly when each web-page was submitted so Internet users can be<br>
aware of its currency. An indirect consequence of this feature is the incentive for web designers to<br>
update their sites. The prominence given to new and updated sites provides a means of becoming<br>
established on the popular hit-list and encourages the use of appropriate key-words and rewards the up<br>
keeping of web pages that users find useful.<br>
High-flyers search.<br>
Fig 8 illustrates a high-flying web pages search associated with the keyword entered in step 320.<br>
This is a list of web pages that are increasing in popularity fastest. If this search is selected and a<br>
keyword is entered, step 324 follows and produces a list of web pages based on the relationship between<br>
the values X and Y taken from Table 3 (172, Fig 5) for the keyword 320 entered. These web pages are<br>
identified by a unique web-page (URL) number from Table 3. Thereafter, in step 326 the list of web-page<br>
numbers found from step 324 is combined with the URL address and web-page description from Table 2<br>
(188 Fig 5). In step 328 the resulting list of web pages is then tagged depending on the results of step 246<br>
in Fig 5 and sent to the user for them to make their selection.<br>
The high-flyer list is calculated by comparing the old popular ranking (Y) and the new popular<br>
ranking (X) from Table 3. From this the percentage increase in hits is calculated. An alternative method<br>
would be to rank the rate of change of popularity by the number of places they rose compared to last<br>
time.<br>
The formula of calculating the rate of change of popularity for this embodiment is given by:<br>
((X-Y)/Y).(X/(XmB))<br>
where X„, is the maximum value of X for the corresponding key-words and fl is an additional variable<br>
that can be changed to alter the relative significance of changes at the top and bottom of the popularity<br>
list.<br>
The reason for multiplying by the maximum value of X is to ensure that small changes at the lower<br>
popularity levels do not swamp more significant changes higher up the table. For example, a web site<br>
having previously recorded only one selection and then attracting 5 hits the next day would exhibit<br>
percentage increase of 500% whilst another web-page may have experienced an increase from 520 hits to<br>
4000 hits (a much more significant increase) though this would otherwise appear as a lower percentage<br>
increase.<br>
Random search.<br>
This is a random selection of less-popular web-pages for the user that want to look at web-pages off<br>
the beaten track, based upon a random selection of web pages that has any value of X, Y, and Z<br>
associated with a keyword that is entered. Accordingly, after a user enters a keyword in step 352 as<br>
indicated in Fig. 9, reference is made to the keyword URL link table 172 illustrated in Fig 5, and a<br>
random list of web pages numbers are generated automatically using a random number generator are<br>
determined, as illustrated at step 354. Only web pages that have values for X, Y or Z associated with the<br>
key word are chosen in this random selection as this indicates that at some stage in the past as used or<br>
web page developer thought the web page had some connection to the keyword. Thereafter, in step 356<br>
the list of web-page numbers found from step 354 is combined with the URL address and web-page<br>
description from Table 2 (188 Fig 5). In step 358 the resulting list of web pages is then tagged, depending<br>
on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as described previously, and sent to the user for them to make their<br>
selections.<br>
Conventional search.<br>
This is the normal search method of a conventional search engine, referenced as other search engine<br>
116 in Fig 3, which may or may not be included along with the searches according to the present<br>
invention, at the option of the user, as noted previously.<br>
Content only search.<br>
This is a list of content, such as advertisements, associated with the key-word, which the user cannot<br>
control. The ones that have paid the most will be at the top of the list, as described further hereinafter, in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention. Of course, other systems for identifying the<br>
order of paying content providers can also me implemented.<br>
Previous favorites search.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a previous past favorites search, that is based only on the previous searching of<br>
the individual user. This allows the users to very quickly find sites that they have previously visited and<br>
performs, therefore, automatic book marking. It should be noted that since a password is preferably used<br>
to logon to the search engine system according to the present invention, the user will be able to access<br>
their personal preferences from any computer.<br>
Thus, when the user types in a keyword at step 372 as indicated in Fig. 10, step 374 follows during<br>
which it is determined what are the favorite sites (based on previous usage) for that keyword from the<br>
personal link table 174 illustrated in Fig. 5. Because the user has a password that can be used to logon to<br>
the system the user will thus be able to access their personal preferences form from any computer.<br>
Due to this search capability there is, therefore, no need to manually bookmark web pages. If a user<br>
forgot to book-mark a good site on, for example, 'marbles', they can easily find it by retyping the<br>
keyword that lead them to that site. If a user's preferences change they will be reflected in the personal<br>
links table 174.<br>
Another embodiment of the personal preference search includes specifying the date the web page<br>
was last visited, with or without using a keyword. The web pages are then ranked based on Z in personal<br>
links table 174 of Fig. 5. For example if a user looked at a site in the middle of last year the user can<br>
refine the search by date, thus making it easier to find a previously useful web-pages more easily, even if<br>
they could not remember the relevant keyword.<br>
This automatic book-marking feature can also act as a device for monitoring the type of Internet use<br>
being undertaken by a particular computer and thus for example, can provide warning to<br>
parents/employers of children/employees accessing undesirable sites, such as adult web-pages. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, for parents/employers unlikely to use the computer themselves, notification of<br>
such usage is automatically provided by letter to the parent/employer thatlists the keywords selected and<br>
web pages visited by the children/employees. This information is found directly from each user table<br>
174 of Fig. 5.This requires a user identification code that also included parental/employee information.<br>
Collective search<br>
The collective search, as illustrated in Fig. 11, is the default search according to the present<br>
invention and is used when the user does not actively choose on of the other search options.<br>
Upon entry of a keyword in step 402, that keyword is used to select from a combination of web page<br>
selections associated with that keyword. As shown, for example, in step 404, an equally weighted<br>
combination of conventional, popular, highflier, new and past search results is used to obtain a list of<br>
web page numbers. Thereafter, in step 406 the list of web-page numbers found from step 404 is<br>
combined with the URL address and web-page description from Table 2 (188 Fig 5). In step 408 the<br>
resulting list of web pages is then tagged, depending on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as described<br>
previously, and sent to the user for them to make their selections, the system is first configured, the<br>
search engine 10 database will not posses any information on popular, high flyers and new web page hit-<br>
lists, so search results will initially be obtained from the conventional hit-list (normal search engine), and<br>
the tagged web pages then used to create the database sets as have been described. As the system<br>
develops, the data sets associated with each of the other search types will become populated, and<br>
searches using the other search types will become more useful.<br>
Date created search.<br>
Fig 12 illustrates a date created search that allows the user to select the date that the web-page was<br>
submitted. This feature will only work for web-pages that contain a date created data entry, identified as<br>
date-time submission 74 in Fig. 4. Upon entry of a date-time and/or a keyword in step 432, the search<br>
engine 10 will perform step 434 in which a list of web page numbers associated with these variables is<br>
obtained. Thereafter, in step 436 the list of web-page numbers found from step 404 is combined with the<br>
URL address and web-page description from Table 2 (188 Fig 5). In step 438 the resulting list of web<br>
pages is then tagged, depending on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as described previously, and sent to the<br>
user for them to make their selections.<br>
Customized search<br>
Fig 13 illustrates a customized search that allows the user to decide how they want their default hit-<br>
list to appear. In step 462, the keyword and User ID is selected in order to initiate the customized search.<br>
Prior to initiating the customized search in step 466, which step is identical to step 404 of the collective<br>
search previously described with respect to Fig. 11, however, step 464 is applied to customize the users<br>
default mixture of hit-lists For example a user may want their default search results to include only<br>
popular and new web pages but no high flying web pages. This custom search is then performed in step<br>
466 to generate a list of web page numbers. Thereafter, in step 468 the list of web-page numbers found<br>
from step 466 is combined with the URL address and web-page description from Table 2 (188 Fig 5). In<br>
step 470 the resulting list of web pages is then tagged, depending on the results of step 246 in Fig 5 as<br>
described previously, and sent to the user for them to make their selections, one preferred embodiment,<br>
the make-up of the default search results list can be amended by 'learning' from the user's behavior to<br>
create a changing customized search based on the user's own search patterns. If a user consistently<br>
chooses new web pages or high-flying web pages for example, then their set of default search results will<br>
be changed to reflect their normal search style.<br>
Magazine search.<br>
The magazine search according to the present invention enables users to search by following a<br>
series of menu-driven subject choices (or similar hierarchical structure), rather than entering a specific<br>
key-word(s).<br>
Existing magazine-style search engines require editors to set the structure of information, decide on<br>
its relevant merits and set the criteria, such as price, for space on a given page transmitted to the<br>
user/viewer. Using the search system of the present invention, the users' themselves dynamically decide<br>
what is and is not worth seeing. Thus, although editorial input is needed regarding a hierarchy of<br>
subjects, the web-pages that emerge as the most popular for each of these subjects will evolve<br>
automatically.<br>
Use of data sets for different groups of people<br>
Different popular hit-lists may be employed to provide results which would reflect different cultural,<br>
geographical, professional, gender or age interests. Thus, as shown in Fig. 14, when a user enters a<br>
keyword and User ID in step 490, the default profile of the user can be used to reflect the type of web<br>
pages that people of the same "group" as the user profiles desire to see. Thus, the search that takes place<br>
in step 494 is based on the subscripted X,Y and Z values obtained from the default profile of people of<br>
those "group" affiliations identified in the user's personal profile obtained in step 492. Thus, therather<br>
than an overall global search result, search results are obtained particularized for the group that the user<br>
identifies with. The resulting list of web pages, derived from steps 496 and 498, as have been previously<br>
described, are particularized for that group.<br>
Thus, for a particular user with the profile type New Zealand selected as a geographical factor, a<br>
search for team field sports and related key-words, rugby material might figure prominently, whereas an<br>
American profile type may produce a bias towards baseball/American football material, for example.<br>
This technique offers the ability to discriminate between the different meanings of the same words,<br>
according to the context of the popular hit-list associated with a particular profile type. A general search<br>
using a key-word 'accommodation' for example would include results related to housing, renting and<br>
similar, whereas if the user indicated an interest in optometry in their profile type , then the term<br>
'accommodation' would be interpreted quite differently.<br>
The relevance' of such sites will evolve automatically, without any active evaluation of the sites by<br>
the search engine operator or the user. There are no complex algorithms required to analyze the<br>
relevance of web-sites for particular types of users. Instead, the type of site deemed relevant will be<br>
decided by those users selecting those characteristics for their profile type , i.e. American females<br>
interested in rock-climbing. Sites of greater relevance will naturally attract more hits, increasing their<br>
ranking and thus increasing the chance of a subsequent user also investigating the site. In the above<br>
example, any web sites listed for the keyword 'accommodation' which were unrelated to optometry,<br>
sight, lens, vision, etc., would not be accessed for the period of time required to make a valid hit. It<br>
would therefore receive a very low ranking and hence be even less likely to be accessed by further users.<br>
The user can select different profile types for different searches during a single session and is not be<br>
restricted to the default profile types.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, there can be included a level of authentication for person's<br>
of a certain group to have their search results actually be used for purpose of updating the database<br>
relating to that group. For example, doctors who have a user ID that identifies them as doctors may<br>
perform a search related to a certain medical condition, and their selections can be tagged and used in the<br>
database for that group of doctors as has been previously described. However, although patient's may<br>
desire to identify their profile with that of the same group of doctors, their selections are not as<br>
significant as those of the actual doctors, and thus while they are able to view the web page listings that<br>
doctors deem most pertinent, their selections are not used to update the doctor's group database, since<br>
their IDs do not identify them as a doctor<br>
Limiting search options<br>
Another feature of the present invention is keyword eliminator feature, which is illustrated in Fig.<br>
15, and prevents certain users, such as children, from searching for undesirable keywords and web-pages<br>
when the keyword eliminator feature is turned on. The present inventor's have realized that it is<br>
potentially much easier for example, to stop children searching for pornography, rather than attempting to<br>
trace and prevent access to all sites on the Internet with pornographic content. This would be used as a<br>
complimentary tool to existing "net nanny" type devices. Thus, as shown in Fig. 15, with the keyword<br>
eliminator turned on, a preexisting table inaccessible keywords is stored in a table and compared in step<br>
522 with a keyword previously entered, as shown by step 520. Thus, keywords that are inaccessible will<br>
not be searched. Thus, for example, parents could choose the types of keywords 552 that they do not<br>
want their children to search for - and this will be different for different sets of parents. The system<br>
filters out the keywords that may be used for subsequent searching in step 524.<br>
Determining which users to sample<br>
Fig 16 illustrates the process of determining which search results should be sampled and used to<br>
make up the cumulative surfer trace table 170 of fig. 4, also referred to as Table 4. While possible, it is<br>
not necessary to collect data concerning every single search, and this can be controlled by determining<br>
which sets of results get sent out with "tagged" web pages. Reference with respect to this was already<br>
mentioned with respect to authenticating user's of a particular group, doctors in the example provided.<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, after entry of keywords and other data in step 554, there are three decisions<br>
that determine whether results are actually "tagged" as has been previously described in step 118 of Fig.<br>
3.<br>
As shown by step 556, for a user that has a user ID and has chosen to use the personal links table<br>
174 of Fig. 5 (Table 6) as previously described, it is necessary to "tag" all of their results so that all of<br>
their past preferences are recorded in their personal links table 174. The search engine according to the<br>
present invention system can update the user's personal preferences but not update Table 3 if certain<br>
security levels have not been satisfied (see below). If, however, the personal link table 174 is stored on<br>
an individual's computer rather than at central location there is no need to send out tagged results as the<br>
data is stored locally.<br>
As shown by step 558, when a keyword is submitted, a check is made that the IP address 62 has not<br>
already searched the keyword using security table 168 (Table 7) before the user is sent a set of tagged<br>
results. If so, the user can still undertake the search though it will not contribute to the cumulative surfer<br>
trace 170 (Table 4). This allows all normal users to affect the popular hit-list and all users to search<br>
whatever they would like, but prevents fraudulent users, such as spammers, from contributing to the<br>
popular hit-list. The security table 168 can also include information on links between keywords 52 and a<br>
user ID 56 to detect repeat searching.<br>
While it is possible for user's to change the IP address of their computer, this is also detectable and<br>
preventable by a number of methods such registering and tracking the use of IP numbers.<br>
Other methods to exclude false searches include:<br>
• Only creating a surfer trace for users with a user ID 554 recorded with the search engine.<br>
• Extending the time limit requited to make a visit count as a useful hit.<br>
• Do not count single visits to a URL from a keyword (for which there is no means of measuring a<br>
lapsed-time).<br>
As shown by step 560, popular keywords can be traced once every tenth, hundredth, or even<br>
thousandth occurrence, and the frequency of this selection can be changed to optimize the system. The<br>
frequency of keyword usage is determined from keyword table 164 as shown in Fig. 5 (Table 1). The<br>
frequency of sending out tagged results can also be linked to the rate at which popularity is changing for<br>
different key words. For example the keyword "IBM" would probably have IBM's home page at the top<br>
and most user's would go there, whereas the key word "latest fads" may have a constantly changes set of<br>
web pages that needs to be sampled more frequently.<br>
To avoid the keyword URL link table 172 of fig. 5 (Table 3) from becoming unduly large, one method<br>
is to only register keywords in Table 3 once they reach a certain frequency of usage. This is controlled by<br>
not sending out tagged results for less frequently used keywords (found from Table 1).<br>
Active suggestion of web pages to visit<br>
Another feature of the present is illustrated by Fig 17, and involves using data to actively suggest<br>
web pages. This is different from a search because the user sets up the request and is informed if there is<br>
any new data on the subject. To do this the users has to actively specify which keywords they are<br>
interested in and the profile type that they would like to act as a filter or agent and the search type (new,<br>
highflying, popular) in step 588. This information is stored in the user's profile ID 166 shown in Fig. 5<br>
(Table 5).<br>
Thus, at various interval's the user receives a list of suggested web pages determined by a group of<br>
like minded humans. For example a user may choose to be notified of web pages with the following<br>
Keyword 582 profile type (agent 588)Search type 586<br>
Rugby New Zealand, Male highflying<br>
Decay treatments Dentist new<br>
This way if there are highflying web pages on "rugby" that other New Zealand males found useful<br>
(i.e. they spent a significant amount of time looking at the information - high rate of change of X in<br>
Table 3) the user would be notified. Similarly if there was any new information on "decay treatments"<br>
submitted for dentists to look at, the user would be identified about it (value of Z in Table 3). It is<br>
unlikely that a computer agent will ever be as good at filtering information as a selected group of peers.<br>
An advantage of this system compare to other "agent type" software is that this does not require any<br>
software on the user's computer. It is all included as a natural extension to the other search engine data<br>
sets.<br>
The suggested web-sites can be displayed for the user when they next access the search engine or<br>
they may choose to be notified of these suggested web pages via e-mail notification. This way web<br>
pages can be drawn to the user's attention without any active searching for these keywords.<br>
Passive suggestion of web pages to visit<br>
Another feature of the present is illustrated by Fig 18, and involves automatic web-page suggestion<br>
based on how the user has searched in the past and requires no active input from the user.<br>
As shown, in step 620, upon the entry of a user ID, the system can be activated passively, at various<br>
intervals or times (such as at each login to the search engine), by looking at which keywords, profile<br>
types and search types, the users frequently looks at using the personal links table 174 of Fig. 5 (Table<br>
6). For example, it may be that the user frequently looks at Rugby information as a "New Zealand, male"<br>
and looks at decay treatments as a "dentist". This information can be found from the automatic book<br>
marking table, previously referred to personal links table 174. If the user has not looked at these subjects<br>
for a certain length of time and there are new or highflying information sources, the user will be<br>
automatically notified of these new information sources.<br>
In a modification of this embodiment, a periodic e-mail can be sent out with the two newest and<br>
highest flying sites related to the key-words of the user.<br>
Determining a list of suggested keywords<br>
A problem with Internet searching for many users is knowing which key-word to use for searching.<br>
While the present invention could be implemented with an infinite number of keywords, too many key-<br>
words (includes phrases) that users choose can be problematic.<br>
Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 19, the present invention also provides for a data set 642 that provides<br>
synonyms for the keywords entered along with the particular profile type in step 640. The system<br>
represented in Fig 19 is referred to as a key word suggester. This is implemented, in one embodiment,<br>
by matching the key-word entered by the user in step 640 with the existing key-words and phrases in<br>
keyword table 164 of Fig. 5 (Table 1) that other users have tried using other search methods, identified in<br>
step 646. Each keyword is then tagged in step 660, and those that are selected by a user in step 662 are<br>
used to form a keyword surfer trace 648 as shown in Fig. 19, which contains the original keyword 52 that<br>
the user entered, the keyword selected 652, and the IP address 130, user ID 128 and date-time 132 data as<br>
in the previously described web page surfer trace.<br>
The data from the cumulative keyword surfer trace 648 is then used to reinforce links between<br>
keywords. In this way the system learns which keywords are associated with each other. The system<br>
learns which words are related to each other in the same way that the system learns which URL's are<br>
associated with the key-words. The lists of suggested keywords will become more relevant over time as<br>
the relevancy is improved each time the keyword suggester is used.<br>
Creating data sets that determine the suggested keywords<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, a keyword link table 696 and a cumulative keyword trace table 698 are used<br>
along with the previously described security table 168 to create the data sets for suggested keywords.<br>
The key-word link table 696, shown in Table 10 below, records how often each key-word is selected from<br>
the suggested key-word list. This can then be used to rank the of the usefulness of different key-words<br>
relative to each other.<br><br>
It can be seen from the Table 10 that people who entered key-word 2 found key-word 3 the most useful<br>
followed by keyword 5 then key-word 1. The keywords can have a directional aspect, for example,<br>
keyword 3 was found useful 1134 times after trying keyword 2. However keyword 2 was found useful<br>
only 356 times after users tried key-word 3.<br>
Information about the links between keywords in Table 10 is updated by the information about how<br>
people are using suggested keywords (keyword surfer traces 648). The cumulative keyword surfer trace<br>
698 is the combined information from all individual keyword surfer traces 648 and it is used to determine<br>
how many "hits" (significant visits) each keyword had for each key-word.<br>
The information collected from each individual surfer trace is a series of inputs become a cumulative<br>
keyword surfer trace, shown in table form below in Table 11.<br><br>
Populating the keyword link Table<br>
Fig 20 also illustrates how links between keywords in Table 10 can be initiated by recording<br>
sequences of keywords that users put into the search engine. If, for example someone searches using the<br>
keyword "NHL" and then "National Hockey League", this would then draw an association between these<br>
two key-words in Table 10 by recording this as one hit. Again this captures the reasoning power of<br>
users to define the link between two keywords. Often the keyword in sequence will be totally unrelated to<br>
the previous key-word but sometimes it will be relevant. If the next user chooses it from the key word<br>
selector it will reinforce the key-word link in the same way that repeat selection to web pages reinforces<br>
links between a keyword and a URL.<br>
The following is an example of keywords that may be suggested after entering the a simple key-word<br>
like "Book"<br>
• book sales<br>
• book reviews<br>
• specialist books<br>
• second hand books<br>
• used books<br>
• special edition books<br>
All of these key-words (phrases) would come from information seekers (users) and information providers<br>
(web-page developers). The most appropriate keywords will emerge naturally over time.<br>
All keywords used by users are entered into the key-word link table 696 of Fig. 20. Thus, if people<br>
enter an uncommon keyword such as "cassetes" instead of "cassettes" the key-word suggester will<br>
suggest that the user tries "cassettes". There is therefore, no need to create a set of URL-keyword links in<br>
Table 3 for "cassetes" Thus saving on data space and there is also no need to send a tagged set of results<br>
for the keyword "cassetes". Hence there will be less data sent back to the search engine.<br>
It is also a contemplated embodiment to run the keyword suggester like Table 3 and have high flying<br>
keyword associations and new keyword associations so the system can learn how keyword associations<br>
change over time. For example, the keyword suggester trace can store the most recent keyword links and<br>
modify the main key-word trace by a history factor, in the same way as Table 3 is modified by the<br>
cumulative surfer trace.<br>
The cumulative keyword surfer trace 698 is processed in the same way as the cumulative web-page<br>
surfer trace 170 of Fig 5to reinforce links between keywords in the keyword link table 696 (Table 10).<br>
A time variable can also be included so that if a user chooses another keyword very quickly it is assumed<br>
that the previous keyword was not useful and is not counted as a keyword surfer trace.<br>
Also, the individual keyword suggester can store, for each user, their personal keyword links.<br>
Further, the keyword suggester can be based on a number of different profile types. The word<br>
associations may be quite different for people of different culture, nationality, occupation and age etc.<br>
Different keyword suggesters can capture the key-word association of different groups of people. The<br>
keyword hits in Table 10 can be subscripted in the same way that the values of X,Y and Z are subscripted<br>
for different types of profiles in Table 3, as explained previously.<br>
Using the Tables to create a list of suggested keywords<br>
Fig. 21 illustrates a variety of manners in which a list of suggested keywords can be created.<br>
One manner is by ranking the values of X in the keyword link table 696 (Table 10). This ranked<br>
list of keywords is combined with keywords from a normal search of keywords, described previously<br>
with respect to step 646 of Fig. 19. nother manner of suggesting keywords, shown as step 730, is to<br>
compare the popular list (URLs X values) for the user-entered key-word with the popular-list of other<br>
key-words in Table 3. A similarity pattern X values in Table 3 indicates that these keywords are similar.<br>
For example a user may search for "film reviews" and the keyword suggester may come up with "movie<br>
reviews" which has a more comprehensively searched list of sites. In this case there is no physical<br>
similarity between the words movie and film, but they are linked by the similarity of the patterns of<br>
URLs links they have in common in Table 3.<br>
The usefulness of the key word suggester list is enhanced indicated by step 744, by associating with<br>
each key-word on the suggestion list an indication of whether there are any of the aforementioned<br>
searches available (popular, high flyer, etc.) for that key-word in keyword URL links table 172 of Fig. 5<br>
(Table 3). The keywords with the most search results are then highlighted.<br>
Decision to send out tagged keyword suggestions list.<br>
The security table 168 and keyword link table 696 are used to determine which keyword links to<br>
sample in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to tagging web pages. As with the<br>
decision for tagging web pages this can depend on whether it is a repeat keyword (found from security<br>
table 168) and on the frequency of keyword usage (found from keyword table 164), as well as the<br>
considerations previously discussed.<br>
Determining other content<br>
When searching on the Internet, various different web pages listings and web pages are displayed as<br>
has been described. One common characteristic of each these different web page listings that have been<br>
described is that when they are displayed they appear substantially identical to one another. As shown in<br>
Fig. 25, each of the different listings 900, though the text may be different, is otherwise visually identical.<br>
Other listings 902, however, are many times larger than the listings 900, may include graphical content,<br>
and appear more prominent when displayed to the user. Such listings can contain the same content as a<br>
web page listing, or other content, such as advertisements, pictures, editorials and the like.<br>
This other content may be displayed to a particular user based upon key-words, user profile type<br>
(nationality, age ,gender, occupation, and so forth) and the time of the day, for example.<br>
In many instances, this content that is displayed along with web page listings is inserted into the<br>
display area using mechanisms that are different from the searching system described previously with<br>
respect to conventional search engines. The mechanism by which this content is displayed in large<br>
measure based upon some other criteria, such as payment for the space that is used. While the system for<br>
selecting this content works, it is difficult to keep track of which content was displayed when, especially<br>
if that content is frequently changed. Thus, another aspect of the present invention, which will now be<br>
discussed, is a system for tracking changing content, and allowing for content providers to dynamically<br>
select when their content will be displayed. This dynamic selectable content, as illustrated in Fig. 22,<br>
may be displayed to the viewer based upon keyword or profile type as entered by the viewer in step 762<br>
as shown. Within the content selector step 764 that then follows, the time of the day is considered and<br>
used in selecting the appropriate content 902 as illustrated in Fig. 25 along with the web page listings<br>
900. Each content 902 transmitted with the search results made up of web page listings 900 is tagged in<br>
step 766. Thus, if a user in step 768 selects that content 902, the results of that selection is fed back to<br>
the content selector 764 so that the content database associated therewith, can be updated as surfer trace<br>
data in a manner such as has been previously described. Thereafter, in step 770, that content 902 is<br>
displayed, typically simultaneously with content 900<br>
In addition to the surfer trace data being input as has been previously described, this content<br>
embodiment also provides for the web page developer, or content provider, to determine the frequency<br>
with which this content will be reviewed, and, depending upon the patterns of users with respect to web<br>
page listings that are viewed, alter the manner in which the content provider's content 902 is displayed<br>
based upon key words, user profile and die like. In order to implement this dynamic content flexibility,<br>
there are three additional data tables, illustrated in Fig. 23, which are used to track the changing content<br>
902. These tables are keyword content data table 804, personal profile content data table 806; and<br>
content provider data table 812. Keyword content data table 804 is illustrated in more detail in Table 12<br>
below, and its characteristics are:<br>
H is the cumulative number of hits for one time period for the keyword. This is the number of times<br>
people choose that keyword;<br>
• N is the number of times particular content 900 that is associated witha keyword has been sent out for<br>
display. This is not necessarily the same as H since content associated with a profile type may be have<br>
a different selection factor than content associated with the keyword. This selection factor can be<br>
various variables, such as votes or price;<br>
- A is the selection factor for the keyword from each content provider (e.g. a selection factor could be a<br>
$ bid to be associated with that keyword);<br>
• T is the total of the selection factors for each keyword and is the sum of A's; and<br>
• P is the content value, as determined by votes or price, for each keyword and is T/N (e.g. this could be<br>
the $ per time content is sent out with that key word- this is a price of being associated with that key<br>
word)<br><br>
This Table can also include the maximum content value M that the content provider is prepared to give.<br>
There is no limit to the number of content providers that may attempt to have content 902 displayed with<br>
a web page listing that is associated with a particular keyword.<br>
It is possible to have a separate Table 12 for each country or area, so that the content value per<br>
country or area, per keyword could be different. In addition there could be different content values for<br>
different time periods in each country or area.<br>
It is possible that provider's of content 902 could target both the key-word and the audience by<br>
identifying each of the keywords with target audiences, e.g. the number of hits associated with the word<br>
rugby could be broken down into the different profile type s that search for the word rugby. The<br>
cumulative number of searches for rugby could be 6000 split into 520 under 21's and 4000 21-50 year<br>
olds and 520 50+ age group. Thus, there may be a different content value for each of these sub classes<br>
within a keyword search.<br>
In addition to the key-word dataset 804 it is possible to have a data set of the following type for<br>
different profile types 806. It contains the same entries for each profile type, instead of keyword as<br>
described above with respect to the keyword content data table 804 of Fig. 23.<br>
Table 13 determines the content value of the content 902 to specific audiences of people as opposed to<br>
different keywords and allows for targeting of specific audiences.<br>
It is within the scope of the present invention to include combination profile types in Table 13 as well,<br>
such as male, professional or New Zealand, females. The content value for the combined profiles will be<br>
different than the content value of individual profiles. The mechanics involved in determining the content<br>
value and choosing the content 902 will be the same, and described further hereinafter.<br>
Content provider data table 812 of Fig. 23 is illustrated in more detail below as Table 14 and<br>
contains information about the content provider, such as name, address, advertiser, content information<br>
such as the Bitmap (HTML or Java applet or similar) that the content 902 will use and a unique number<br>
to identify each different item of content 902.<br>
This Table may also store details of the content provider, such as passwords, payment details (e.g. credit<br>
card number and authorization), content delivery (number of times content has been sent to users) etc.<br>
The data sets for the above mentioned content tables are populated as follows. For the keyword content<br>
data table 804<br>
• H, the cumulative number of hits for a particular key word for one time period, is taken directly from<br>
Table 1 (800).<br>
• N is the number of times content is sent out associated with the keyword. This is incremented each<br>
time an item of content 902 is displayed to a user that is specifically associated with that keyword<br>
810.<br>
• The values for A 802 are selected by content providers for each keyword. The content provider can<br>
also enter a maximum value M over which they will no longer select to be sent out with the keyword.<br>
• T is the tota} for each keyword and is the sum of As<br>
P is the content value, as determined by votes or price, for each keyword and is T/N<br>
Populating the personal profile content data<br>
• H is the cumulative number of hits for each profile type and this information is taken directly from<br>
Table 1 (sum of the indexed W's).<br>
• N is the number of items of content 902 sent out associated with the personal profile. This is<br>
incremented each time an item of content 902 is sent out that is specifically associated with that<br>
profile type 810<br>
• The values for A 808 are placed, through an entry process akin to bidding, for each profile type. The<br>
content provider can also enter a maximum M they are prepared to pay, or vote, as the case may be.<br>
• T is the total for each profile type, and is the sum of As.<br>
P is the content value for each profile and is T/N<br>
Populating the content provider's details table<br>
The majority of the content provider's details 812 are electronically entered by the content<br>
providers. Each time a content provider's content 902 is sent out this event is also recorded in the<br>
content provider's details Table 812. This will also record the number of click-throughs<br>
(820,822,824,826,828) and the cost, in terms of payment or votes, of the content 902. This will form the<br>
basis of the electronic bill or tabulation that is thereafter forwarded to the content provider.<br>
How the data sets are used to select content sent out to users<br>
In the discussion that follows, with reference to Fig. 24, it is assumed that only one banner of<br>
content 902 is transmitted with each set of web page search results 900. The same algorithms apply if<br>
there are multiple sets of content transmitted with each set of web page results.<br>
A keyword and profile type are submitted to the search engine in step 852. From keyword content<br>
data table 804, personal profile content data table 806, the value of content 902 for each is found from the<br>
value of P in the Tables. The highest value of P for the keyword or profile type, determined in step 862,<br>
determines the type of content (keyword or profile type) that is transmitted along with the web page<br>
listings 900. It may be that there is no specific value for the keyword and the user may not be using a<br>
specific profile type. In this case the values for unassigned content items will be used (from Table 13 for<br>
users without a profile). Choosing which specific content item 902 is sent out is discussed below^ The<br>
details for the content item (their graphics, text, associated programs, etc) are taken from Table 14,<br>
content provider details table 814 and transmitted to the user in step 868. Details of the content items 902<br>
transmitted for each content provider are also sent to the content provider, as shown by step 870, at<br>
regular intervals.<br>
Determining whether it is keyword or profile content that is transmitted<br>
The type of content 902 transmitted is dependent upon whether it is a key word based content or<br>
profile option based content. For example a Male from the US may search for fish. The value applicable<br>
to this search is, keyword = fish, profile = male, profile = US, profile = US, male. When deciding which<br>
content gets displayed, the system compares the value of the content for all the possibilities (keyword,<br>
combinations of profile types) and sends out the content that has the most value, as determined in step<br>
862. For example an under 21 male may search using the key-word "Rugby" and the value for the<br>
associated content for Rugby is 0.1 per view, whereas the value per view for targeting an under 21 male<br>
is 0.2 and thus the content targeted at the male under 21 would be displayed rather than the rugby<br>
content. It is important to note that the cumulative frequency of times that content items 902 are<br>
transmitted (N) will be different to the total cumulative frequency' for the targeted area (H). In this<br>
example the cumulative frequency (H) of the number of times 'rugby' is searched for and 'males under<br>
21' would both incremented by one (via Table 1). However, the number of times an item of content 902<br>
is displayed would be incremented only for the 'male under 21* Table (this is the figure used to<br>
determine the value of the content per unit view.<br><br>
For the key-word "book" the content 902 of content provider 2 would be displayed whenever the<br>
keyword was searched, as they are the only content provider associated with that key-word. However, for<br>
the key-word "fish", content providers 1 and 2 would have their content sent out the same number of<br>
times. In the system scaled to the levels at which it is intended to be used, there will be a very large<br>
number of content providers bidding for different keywords and profile types.<br>
Calculating the value of content<br>
If there is a new content provider who, for the keyword "book," values the content at, for instance, $5<br>
per month, this will change the value to 0.075 and this will mean that the total associated with the word<br>
book is $15. Therefore, content provider 2 would now get transmitted 66% of the time (10/15) and the<br>
new content provider would be displayed 33% of the time. The proportion of time an content provider's<br>
content is transmitted is A/T.<br>
How content provider's use the data tables<br>
When bidding for content 902, content providers select a keyword or profile to target their content<br>
from Tables 12 &amp; 13. The search engine indicates automatically the number of times this search has been<br>
performed for the previous time period (H), the number of times items of content were sent out<br>
associated with that selection (N) and the value of the content P.<br>
The new content provider then enters the selection factor A and the system can then instantly<br>
calculate the new value (P) based on the new total bids (T). The advertiser can also be told the number of<br>
views per month they are likely to get for their bid (N*(A/T)). These changes are calculated in real-time<br>
to give the new content provider an indication of how their bid will influence the value and the views<br>
they will receive for their bid. If a value and number of views are agreeable to the advertiser they can<br>
choose to submit it as a bid for the defined period, such as a day, week, or month, for instance. The<br>
details of other content providers are, preferably, not made public. Content providers may also enter a<br>
maximum value M they can part with for their content. This provides content providers with some<br>
security against paying too much if the value changes. If the value goes too high then a content<br>
provider's bid can drop off the list (if P is greater than M then A is not counted as a bid for that particular<br>
content provider). The bid would go back on the list if the value went down again, thus acting as a<br>
stabilizing mechanism. The content provider can, in a preferred embodiment, be notified by e-mail if<br>
their content 902 has dropped off the list due to their value limit M .<br>
As shown by the content provider details table 812 of Fig. 24, for instance, content providers thus<br>
have an account with the search engine proprietors and procedures for debiting their account for their<br>
content is automatically calculated from the account details on a periodic basis.. An electronic statement<br>
of the number of views, cost per view, number of click-throughs and cost per click-through for each<br>
content provider is also forwarded to each content provider, since this information is also stored in<br>
content provider details table 812 (Table 14).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, it is possible to identify clusters of similar keywords based on the<br>
keyword link table. The reason for identifying clusters of keywords is so that content 902 can be targeted<br>
at groups of words rather than just individual words. The cluster for the key-word "car" may include<br>
hundreds or thousands of words that have links to the word car (e.g. convertibles, automobiles, vans).<br>
Statistical clustering techniques are used to define the size and frequency of key-word clusters. This<br>
makes it a much more automatic process than an editor deciding on clusters of keywords for content<br>
provider's to target.<br>
The same system can be used to set values for keyword clusters. While grouping words in this way<br>
would incur an increased administration cost, it is nevertheless computationallysimilar and only initiated<br>
once a certain level of hits on a keyword had been exceeded .<br>
Content only search Users can also purposely choose to search only the content provider associated<br>
with a keyword. In this case the search results will be based on the values of A in Table 12. The content<br>
providers that pay the most will be at the top of the list.<br>
The key-word suggester can also help content providers choose key-words or sets of key-words that<br>
they would like to display.<br>
Controlling the search engine system There are a number of parameters that can change the way in<br>
which the search engine according to the present invention ranks web pages. These factors (described in<br>
detail below) are:<br>
• History factor<br>
This determines the rate of decay of the existing popular lists (popular hit list) as described in the<br>
text previously. This is a number between 1 and 0. A high history factor will make it difficult to<br>
change the existing popularity lists. As an example if the rate of searching for a particular keyword<br>
is increasing quickly, then the history factor should be lower to enable emerging web pages to rise<br>
up the popularity list.<br>
• Frequency of updating Table 3 from the cumulative surfer trace<br>
This is a measure of the frequency with which the popularity lists are updated with information<br>
about the users' activities (i.e. the surfer trace), for example, this may be measured once a day or<br>
even once a month depending on the rate of change of popularity of particular keyword searches.<br>
• Sampling frequency<br>
This is the frequency of sampling the information of how users are searching. If it is a common<br>
keyword it is not necessary to monitor every search. It may be that only a percentage of all<br>
searches need be monitored to accurately determine web-page popularity.<br>
• The composition of the default search list (mix of results from the new web-page list, high-flyers<br>
and popular-lists etc.)<br>
The mix of web pages presented to the user as a default can be changed if necessary to reflect the<br>
way in which search results evolve over time.<br>
• Content 'hit. factor'<br>
The "content hit factor" is a measure of the weighting given to a hit on content being recorded as a<br>
hit for a keyword. The default setting is that a hit on content counts the same as a hit from the list<br>
of web pages. The value of content hits can be set higher or lower than unity, depending on the<br>
price of the content, e.g. the "content hit factor" may need to be increased for valuable keywords<br>
as this would decrease the ability to spam these commercially valuable keywords. The higher the<br>
content factor, the higher the resistance to spam as the search results would be more dependent on<br>
price rather than popularity.<br>
• The time period for content bidding<br>
Content providers bid a certain amount for a particular time period e.g. one month. This time<br>
period may be different depending on the rate-of-change of the price; If the price is changing<br>
rapidly or is very stable, the time period may be respectively shortened or lengthened<br>
correspondingly.<br>
• Number of key-words per web-page submission<br>
This number could be changed to influence how the system learns from new web pages<br>
submissions.<br>
• Length of time between accepting new-web-page submissions<br>
If the date of submission for a web-page is too close to the existing submission for that web-page,<br>
then it is not accepted. This length of time can be changed depending on any of the above factors<br>
• Number of searches per day, per person (IP address or user ID) that count as valid hits<br>
This number can be changed to reduce the possibility of spamming<br>
• Length of time before renewing the security Table<br>
The security Table that restricts abuse, notes the links between keywords and IP addresses of user<br>
identifications. The length of time between refreshing this Table can be changed to make it harder<br>
to spam the system.<br>
The settings for these factors can be different for different keywords or groups of people depending on:<br>
• Frequency with which searches are done<br>
• The rate-of-change of frequency of searches<br>
• The price of the content<br>
• The rate of change of price of content<br>
The precise setting of each of these factors will not be known until the system begins operation<br>
'learning' about the users behaviors. The optimum settings for different situations may be determined by<br>
experimentation.<br>
Other applicationsThough the preferred embodiment has been described with reference to a software<br>
useable on a computer network for searching the Internet, it will be appreciated that the invention may be<br>
readily applied to any search system where a human user chooses results from a set of initial search<br>
results. Such a system may for example be part of an, a LAN or WAN or even a database on an<br>
individual PC.<br>
Examples of other possible areas of application for the present invention are described below.<br>
Intranet searches and other data base searches<br>
Intranet searches at present suffer from similar drawbacks from Internet searches, indeed some<br>
intranets can in themselves be extremely substantial systems, in which identifying a particular<br>
information source or item can be equally problematic. Utilizing the present invention in such<br>
applications is within the intended scope of the present invention.<br>
Searching other media forms<br>
The present invention is also intended to be applied matching a user's profile to other media sources<br>
(such as pay per-view, television, videos, music and the like), thus allowing content targeted to a<br>
particular audience. The same form of search lists as described above (Popular-list, High-flyers, Hot-off<br>
the press, etc) may be employed to direct users to appropriate material.<br>
Shopping<br>
The search techniques described herein can be implemented in a consumer network to assist<br>
shoppers in selecting items from within one shop or among a large number of shops. Instead of using a<br>
keyword-URL link Table, there would be used a keyword-item purchased link Table, that then records<br>
what items were purchased after each shopping request (key-word). This embodiment also records where<br>
the user purchased the product. Each time a shopper purchased an item this would increment the<br>
popularity of that item, using the same techniques described previously.<br>
The profile type s in this embodiment can be used to record the types of purchases made by different<br>
sets of people. One could, for example, select a profile type and see what are the most commonly<br>
purchased items for a range of users, and would provide assistance in choosing gifts for people who have<br>
a different profile type than yourself.<br>
Scientific publications<br>
Searching scientific data bases (on-line papers, journals, etc.) with the present invention will<br>
dramatically reduce the time spent examining obscure, or esoteric areas only to find the information<br>
irrelevant. The criteria for a valid hit for such uses would typically incorporate the extended timefeature<br>
described above to establish the usefulness of the information source. The refereeing and referencing of<br>
academic/scientific papers using the present invention could enhanced by classifying different levels or<br>
types of user, e.g. Dr, Professor etc. postgraduate, and so forth. This will enable users to see. for<br>
example, what information sources the eminent authorities in a particular field found of interest. It would<br>
also allows the authors of a paper to become aware of how often their publication was accessed and<br>
possibly further indicate where and how often the paper was used as a reference in subsequent papers.<br>
Users may have to formally register with different organizations to obtain levels of ability to referee.<br>
Users may also choose the level of refereeing for their searching.<br>
Online help<br>
There is currently a substantial global requirement for on-line help and support, particularly for<br>
computer/software applications. Such a need would be considerably assuaged by use of the present<br>
invention as the software developers obtain a direct feedback to the type and frequency of particular<br>
inquiries, whilst the users receive the accumulated benefit of the previous users. Different profile type s<br>
would enable the answers to be provided in an appropriate form for the user , e.g. novice, expert, etc.<br>
The keyword suggester may, for example, suggest searching with key-words (questions) more likely to<br>
yield a satisfactory response. There can be a range of answers to each question and as the system learns it<br>
will converge on to the best answers.<br>
Question and answer services<br>
Current On-line question/answer programs could be configured to run via the present invention, thus<br>
enabling answers to repeatedly asked questions to be based on previous questions and similar questions<br>
to be suggested.<br>
Content optimization on other parts of the internet<br>
The same content bidding mechanism could be used to determine the price of content for any<br>
location on the Internet, not just web page listings as identified above. In this embodiment, content<br>
providers will bid for a general content space to set the price automatically.<br>
The profile type information from the search engine could be used as a passport so that other<br>
advertisements on the Internet could be more targeted to different audiences. This profile type<br>
information could also be used by web-page developers to customize their web-page for different sets of<br>
users.<br>
People matching service<br>
In another embodiment, the system according to the present invention can be used as a dating<br>
service and/or a method for matching people with similar preferences by doing a statistical analysis to<br>
compare the individual preferences (Table 6) of groups of users. The individual past preference Tables,<br>
in this embodiment, would preferably be normalized and compared to each other using a standard<br>
correlation coefficient. When compared to other users it would give a numerical indication of how<br>
similar their preferences are.<br>
The same embodiment could also be used to find information about similar people from there past<br>
preferences Tables. For example one could ask to be give the names of people in New Zealand with an<br>
interest in Ecological Economics and a search could be made of the personal preferences Tables. Such an<br>
embodiment, however, would typically include a password/consent indicator that provides consent of<br>
identified persons to give out their information, which consent could be given, for example, in only<br>
certain circumstances, which circumstances are limited to searchers who have a level of authority and<br>
password indicating the same, or for persons who identify themselves with certain characteristics.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the<br>
most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the<br>
disclosed embodiment. For example, each of the features described above can be use singly or in<br>
