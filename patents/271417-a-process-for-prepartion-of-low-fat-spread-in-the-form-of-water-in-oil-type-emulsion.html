Provisional<br>
-Not Applicable-<br><br>
Complete<br>
The following specification particularly<br>
describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION:<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to the process for production of a low-fat spread (20-60 wt % fat) using ghee, which comprises separate preparation and tempering of fat and serum phases before blending them and remain acceptable for 4 months at refrigerator temperature (3-13°C) without excessive softening at ambient temperature (23-31°C)<br>
2.	BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION:<br>
Besides nutritional significance, the pleasant flavour of butter-fat imparts a unique status to butter and ghee in Indian diet (Aneja et al., 2002). With increasing urbanization and ever- pervade influence of modernization on the rural populace, table butter as also bread, is gaining popularity day by day. However, due to continuing rise in population, escalating price and correspondingly decline purchase power of the consumer, butter remains beyond the reach of most of the masses. Further, it is generally recognized that high caloric diet with inadequate physical activity result in over weight and obesity, which in turn could lead to many diseases. Moreover, the dietary fat beside the quantity has been recognized to be very important. Another factor determining the consumer acceptance of table butter is its spreadability. Thus, the consumer's convenience demands that product is spreadable when it has been just removed from the refrigerator and retain its stand up property, even at ambient temperature. A great deal if this target were realized with the development of low-fat spread (Dostalova, 2003). According to PFA (Amendment rule 1993) defined fat spread as a product in the form of water-in-oil emulsion of an aqueous phase and fat phase of edible oil and fats excluding animal fats. Low fat dairy spread containing 39-41 per cent fat are some time termed as 'half fat butter' (CAC, 2004). Considerable efforts have been made in India and abroad for development of fat spread of dairy and non-dairy type using range of fat sources.<br>
The present invention related to process for production of a low-fat spread utilizes clarified milk fat (ghee), as a fat source. Since ghee is used traditionally in diet as a spread over paratha, chapatti, puranpoli, etc. The exploitation of ghee in the manufacture of low-fat spread is the dire need of today's dairy industry and it is already utilized in the manufacture of butter (Sangeeta et al. 2003 and Chennigaraju et al,2005) due to its easy availability and better shelf life at ambient temperature.<br>
The process for manufacture of low-fat spread using ghee is a new invention can also be useful in extending the supply of butter to a large number of people. At the same time, by their good taste, flavour and low cost as well as necessary spreadability, it can meet the<br><br>
consumer requirement. It is high time for the Indian dairy industry to plug into fat spreads, and encourage the use of dairy products as ingredient in composite products.<br>
Summary of the invention: In the invention of process for development of low-fat spread using ghee it has been found that fat phase (34-44 wt %) with serum phase (55-65 wt %) wherein 5-20 wt % of milk solid not fat (MSNF) and with suitable minor important ingredients like surface-active agent, thickener, plasticizer, common salt produces the product with spreadability at refrigerator temperature and remains stable at temperature of 30°C. In a further aspect the invention relates to a process for the preparation of these products. 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to the process for production of a low-fat spread (20-60 wt% fat) using ghee, comprises separate preparation and tempering of fat and serum phases before blending them. Ghee was heated to meltdown temperature, followed by addition of surface-active agent like Tween-80, Tween-60, Tween-40, Tween-20 and Glycerol Monostearate (0.1 -0.4 wt%) and butter colour (0.1-0.2 wt %). It was then heated to 60-80°C before being rapidly cooled to 10-30°C with continuous agitation in a chilled water-bath and subsequently to 5-15°C by quiescent holding in a refrigerator for an overnight period. The cooled fat phase was then tempered to the blending temperature of 10-30°C by holding in water bath for 6 hr before use.<br>
The serum phase preparation involved mixing of skim milk powder or whey protein concentrate as a source of MSNF (5-20 wt %), and dispersed in water together with 0.1-0.4 wt % thickener such as carrageenan, guar gum, alginate, corn starch, carboxyl methyl cellulose and starch or pectin, 0-1 wt % plasticizer (glycerol or sorbitol) and 0.75 to 2.5 wt % of common salt. The mixture was mixed with a hand electric blender. The mixture was pre¬heated (55°C), filtered (1-4 fold muslin cloth), pasteurized (72-74°C for 15-20 sec) and cooled in an ice water-bath to 20°C and holding overnight in a refrigerator. Finally, when required this serum phase was acidulated using a dilute citric acid or lactic acid to 5.25-6.00 pH added with flavourings and warmed it to blending temperature (10-30°C).<br>
The tempered fat phase was transferred to the bowl/utensil of planetary mixer or any other suitable type, and creaming was carried out using the suitable attachment of the mixer for 30-60 sec at 'medium' speed. The serum phase was added in one or three equal installments. Blending was carried out after addition of the serum phase using low to medium speed for 30-180 sec. It was continued further for few sec at same speed. Finally after thorough mixing at high speed the spread was packed in 200 g polypropylene tubs (11.0 X 6.4 X 3.5 cm) and closed with polyethylene lids before being transferred to refrigerator (5-<br><br>
7°C). The product so packed will remain acceptable for at least 4 months at refrigerator<br>
temperature.<br>
4. EXAMPLE:<br>
Ghee was heated to 50°C, followed by addition of Tween-80 the surface active agent (0.2 wt%) and annatto butter colour (0.1 wt%). It was then heated (in a water-bath) to 70°C before being rapidly cooled to 20°C (rate of cooling, 12°C/min) with continuous agitation in a chilled water-bath (1.5°C ± 1°C) and subsequently to 5°C by quiescent holding in a refrigerator for an overnight period. The cooled fat phase was then tempered to the blending temperature of 25°C ± 1°C by holding in water bath for 6 hr before use.<br>
The aqueous phase preparation involved mixing of skim milk powder as a source of MSNF (16.71 wt%) and was dispersed in water together with 0.21 wt % carrageenan, 0.19 wt% glycerol and 1.5 wt % common salt (in the finished product). The mixture was mixed with a electric blender. The mixture was passed through the process of heating (55°C), filtration (2- fold muslin cloth), pasteurization (72°C for 15 - 20 sec), cooling in an ice water-bath to 20°C and holding overnight in a refrigerator. Finally, when required this aqueous phase was acidulated using a dilute citric acid to 5.25 pH added with diacetyl (4ppm) flavouring and warmed it to blending temperature (25°C).<br>
The tempered fat phase was transferred to the bowl of Hobart Food Mixer (Model N-50, Hobart corp., USA.) and creaming was carried out using the flat beater attachment of the mixer for 30 sec at 'medium' speed (285 rpm for agitator and 125 rpm for attachment). The aqueous phase was added in three equal installments. Blending was carried out after each addition of the serum phase using medium speed for 30 sec. It was continued further for 150 sec at same speed, and finished with a 30 sec, high-speed (591 rpm for agitator and 259 rpm for attachment) run of the mixer. The spread was packed in 200 g polypropylene tubs (11.0 X 6.4 X 3.5 cm) and closed with polyethylene lids before being transferred to refrigerator (5°C).<br><br><br>
