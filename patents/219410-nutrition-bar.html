NUTRITION BAR<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan  Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>

1<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to edible nutrition bars, especially nutrition bars useful in the control or maintenance of body weight.        <br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Increasingly, a focus of modern preventive medicine is weight reduction. Excessive weight is frequently cited in reports concerning the surge in cases of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, obesity is often mentioned in discussions of other modern diseases, such as heart disease.<br>
For years a debate has raged as to which class of nutrients, fats or carbohydrates, are preferentially'minimized to promote weight loss X Recently, much consumer attention has focussed on those who advocate reduction of carbohydrates and higher -intakes of unsaturated fat and/or protein.<br>
An increasingly popular form for ingestion of nutrients for those seeking to lose weight is the nutrition bar. The nutrition bar provides a convenient vehicle for replacing a meal or for supplementing meals as a snack. While consumers express a preference for snacks and other foods which are more healthful and which can assist them to achieve their weight loss goals, they show little inclination to sacrifice the   organoleptic properties of their favorite foods. Therefore, the successful food formulator must improve the nutrient value of [ the food while maintaining desirable organoleptic properties. J High protein levels are particularly difficult to incorporate into good tasting foods since popular proteins, such as soy<br>
2<br><br>
and/or rice, often have undesirable (after)tastes or develop such undesirable tastes or aftertastes upon storage. In particular, with certain products comprising soy and/or rice proteins an off-flavour.may develop upon storage. Also the appearance and/or texture of such foods may deteriorate over time.<br>
EP-A-1,302, 111 discloses dietary bar compositions comprising soy protein, and low levels of glycerol. Some of the examples of bar compositions further comprise sorbitol.<br><br>
"Joseph et al., US patent No 5,389,345 disclose an unbaked low<br>
calorie food bar comprising proteinaceous material which may be "soy protein and a digestible carbohydrate which may be sorbitol   or glycerin.<br>
Gilles et al. US Patent No. 6,248,375 (Abbott Labs) discloses solid matrix materials designed for the person with diabetes. It includes a source of fructose in combination with at least -one nonabsorbent carbohydrate. The two component carbohydrate system is said to blunt the postprandial carbohydrate response. One of the forms for administration mentioned is nutritional bars. Gilles et al. disclose in the examples nutritional bars comprising about 15 or 16 % by weight of soy protein, about 4.6% by weight of glycerin and a vitamin and mineral pre-mix comprising zinc, iron and copper. Choice dm® Bar is cited as a nutritional bar for people with diabetes and including 17.1% total calories as protein in the form of calcium caseinate, soy protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, toasted soybeans, soy nuggets (soy protein isolate, rice flour, malt, salt) and peanut butter. Gluc-O-Bar® is said to be a medical food designed for use in management of diabetes which includes up to 23% of total calories as protein in the form of soy protein<br>
3<br>
P<br><br>
isolate, non fat dry milk, and peanut flour. The typical amount of protein in the Gilles bars is about 10% to about 25% of total calories, most preferably about 15 to about 20% of total calories.<br>
Keating et al. EP 768 043 (Bristol Meyers-Squibb) is directed to a nutritional composition for use by diabetics containing a controlled absorbed carbohydrate component. The carbohydrate component contains a rapidly absorbed fraction such as glucose or sucrose, a moderately absorbed fraction such as certain cooked starches or fructose and a slowly absorbed fraction such as raw corn starch. Preferred protein sources are said to include whey protein, sodium caseinate, or calcium caseinate, optionally supplemented with amino acids. Other preferred protein sources include protein hydrolysates such as soy protein hydrolysate, casein hydrolysate, whey protein hydrolysate, other animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates. and mixtures thereof. Among the forms mentioned which the invention can take are a nutritional bar or cookie. The nutritional bars and cookies are preferably baked.<br>

directed to animal feed nuggets which contain, or may contain,<br>
protein.	<br>
Various other foods have been described which mention nuggets which may include meat proteins. These include US Patent Nos. 6,086,941, 6,010,738.<br>
Wang et al. US patent No. 6,379,725 discloses protein based, edible chewable pet toys such as artificial dog bones, which comprise 70-86 wt% protein which is a mixture of plant derived protein and animial derived proteim. Minerals such as iron and zinc may be present in trace concentrations and plasticisers such as glycerol may be used.<br>
Despite the many previous efforts to formulate nutrition bars with high levels of protein there is still a need for a good tasting nutrition bar having elevated, levels of protein,      especially nutrition bars comprising soy and/or rice protein and desirable levels of certain minerals, especially transition} metals. In particular, there is a need for such a nutrition barl which does not develop an off-taste on storage and which has good sensorial properties (in particular which is moist and chewy), even after prolonged storage at elevated temperatures e.g. 30oC for 4 weeks. It is also desirable that the bar retains a pleasing appearance for the consumer upon storage e.g. does not brown or otherwise change colour. These have been found to be particular problems in nutrition bars comprising soy protein and transition metals and/or transition metal compounds.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

For a more complete explanation of the above and other features and advantages of the invention, reference should be made to the following description of the preferred embodiments. The preferred embodiments apply to all aspects of the invention and can be used as appropriate for each aspect.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Protein<br>
The nutritional bars of the invention comprise about 10%wt or more in total of soy and/or rice protein based on the total weight of the composition. It is preferred that the nutritional oars  comprise 12%wt to 40%wt, e.g. 12%wt to 35%wt of soy and/or<br><br>
9<br><br>
rice protein, more preferably 13%wt to 30%wt, most preferably 14%wt to 25%wt based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The soy,protein may be present in any suitable form including as isolated soy protein, as soy protein concentrate or as soy protein hydrolysates. Sources of rice protein include rice flour and rice protein concentrate<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that soy and/or rice protein based nutritional bars may suffer from problems of off-flavour development etc because of the presence of free amino acid groups.<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, the nutritional bars comprise l%wt or more soy and/or rice protein present in the composition, based on the total weight of the composition, in. the _form of nuggets (hereinafter protein nuggets). For the other aspects of the invention this is preferred. For all aspects of the invention it is especially preferred that the nutritional bars comprise 5%wt or more soy and/or rice protein in the form of nuggets, more preferably 10%wt or more. It is especially preferred that the nutritional bars comprise 5%wt to 25%wt soy and/or rice protein in the form of nuggets, especially 10%wt to 20%wt. It is preferred that 80%wt or more of the soy and/or rice protein in the bar is present in the form of nuggets, more preferably 90%wt or more, most preferably 95%wt or more, such as 100%wt.<br>
■The protein nuggets preferably comprise 50%wt to 100%wt of soy and/or rice protein, more preferably 55%wt to 100%wt, most preferably 60%wt to 95%wt, such as 75%wt to 95%wt based on the weight of the protein nuggets.<br>
1o<br><br>
The protein nuggets may also comprise one or more of other proteins, such as those listed below, lipids, especially triglyceride fats, and carbohydrates, especially starches. It is especially preferred that the protein nuggets further comprise from l%wt- to 40%wt of a reducing sugar, more      preferably 2%wt to 25%wt, most preferably 3%wt to 20%wt. It is advisable that the remaining ingredients be no more sensitive to heat degradation {e.g have the same or lower degradation point) than the soy and/or rice protein.<br>
In addition to the soy and/or rice protein, other types of protein may also be included in the nutritional bars. -Preferred sources for the other protein which may be used in the present invention (either within the protein nugget or within the bar external to the nugget) include dairy protein sources such as whole milk, skim milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, milk solids non-fat, etc., and include whey "protein such as whey protein isolate and whey protein concentrate and caseins; sources of pea protein; and sources of gelatin protein. The amounts of the other proteins, when present, are preferably within the range of from l%wt to 10%wt, preferably 2%wt to 5%wt.<br>
Especially preferred, to minimize the caloric impact, is the addition of protein as such rather than as one component of a food ingredient such as whole milk. Preferred in this respect are protein concentrates such as one or more of whey protein concentrate, milk protein concentrate, caseinates such as sodium and/or calcium caseinate.<br>
11<br><br>
Total protein levels (soy and/or rice and other protein) within the nutrition bars of the invention, including any protein present in the form of nuggets, are preferably within the range of 10wt% to 40 wt%, especially from 12%wt to 40%wt, more preferably 13%wt to 30%wt, most preferably 14%wt to 25%wt based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The total protein present in the nutritional bar preferably provides up to 50% of the total calories of the bar, more preferably between 20 % and 50%, most preferably between 25%<br>
The present invention may also be applied to milk protein based nutrition bars if the same problems as outlined hereinabove are found in these bars.<br>
Transition metals and transitional metal compounds<br>
According to all aspects of the invention the nutrition bar comprises at least one transition metal or transition metal compound. The transition metal is preferably selected from chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and mixtures thereof. The transition metal compounds are preferably compounds of these transition metals. It has been found that iron, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc can cause particular taste and sensorial problems in nutrition bars comprising soy and/or rice proteins.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, the at least one transition metal or transition metal compound is in a substantially water insolubleformat 20°C and this is preferred for the other aspects of the invention. The transition metal or transition metal compound may be provided<br>
12<br><br>
in the substantially water insoluble form by any suitable means. It is preferred that either a substantially water insoluble salt is used, or, that the metal" or compound is substantially encapsulated in a suitable encapsulant is used to achieve the desired level of water insolubility.<br>
It is advisable to ensure that the transition metal or transition metal compound is in a substantially water insoluble form at all processing temperatures to which the nutrition bar<br>
is subjected during its preparation and ideally also at 5 C or<br>
more above the maximum temperature reached during preparation.<br>
Any substantially water insoluble compound of a transition metal may be used according to the invention, especially substantially water insoluble inorganic compounds.  Such compounds selected from oxides, carbonates and phosphates (including pyrophosphates) are preferred. If copper is used then copper carbonate is preferred. If iron is used then ferric pyrophosphate is preferred. If zinc is used then zinc oxide is preferred.<br>
The nutrition bars of the invention, typically overall comprise up to 100%, typically up to 50%, such as 10 to 35% of the European 2003 RDA of the transition metal. The exact amount of the transition metal and/or transition metal compound will depend upon the type used. Typically the nutrition bars, per bar, will comprise one or more of up to 1 mg of manganese, up to 1.1 mg of copper, up to 9.5 mg of zinc and up to 16 mg of iron. More preferably the nutrition bars comprise one or more of up to 0.5 mg of manganese, up to 0.4 mg of copper, up to 3 mg of zinc and up to 5 mg of iron.<br>
13<br><br>
Alternatively,.or additionally, the transition metal or transition metal compound may be encapsulated to render it substantially water insoluble. This provides a wider choice of the types of transition metal compound which may be used and may allow the inclusion of a more bioavailable compound to be used,. Any suitable encapsulant may be used. It is especially, preferred that an encapsulant is used which does not allow any significant water transmission across the encapsulation layer at temperatures below the melting point of the encapsulant. This is.especially important where the encapsulated transition metal or transition metal compound is subjected to elevated temperatures, e.g. of 60°C or more during the preparation of the nutrition bar.<br>
The term "encapsulated" refers both to an embodiment wherein a coating is substantially formed around the transition metal or transition metal compound and to an embodiment wherein the transition metal or transition metal compound is trapped within or throughout a matrix so that it is rendered substantially water insoluble. The transition metal or transition metal compound preferably has a substantially integral encapsulant coating or matrix around it.<br>
Suitable encapsulant materials include substantially water insoluble edible waxes, proteins, fibres, carbohydrates. The encapsulant material may be cross-linked.<br>
Proteins which may be used as the entire encapsulant material,, or as a part thereof, include gelatin, milk proteins (including caseinates, such as sodium caseinate, and whey proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin and alpha lactalbumin), albumin and vegetable proteins including proteins from beans, legumes and<br><br><br>
14<br><br>
cereals such as soy, pea, maize and wheat and isolated soy proteins. "<br>
Carbohydrates which may be used as the entire encapsulant material, or as a part thereof, include mono or polysaccharides including, cellulose polymers and starches, (including hydrolysed and modified starches) and sugar alcohols. Suitable materials include gum arable, carrageenan, agar agar, alginates, pectins and pectates.<br>
Preferred encapsulants are carbohydrates such as alginates or pectins, especially including the sodium, potassium and calcium salts of alginates.<br>
Mixtures of sodium caseinate and either gum arabic, carrageenan, agar agar, and gum arabic, are suitable. Similarly, beta-lactoglobulin and either gum arabic, carrageenan, agar agar, alginate.or pectins, especially beta-lactoglobulin and gum arabic may be used.<br>
It is preferred that the weight ratio of the transition metal and/or transition metal compound to the encapsulant is in the range of from 5:1 to 1:15, preferably 1:2 to 1:12, e.g. 1:5 to 1:10.<br>
The transition metal or transition metal compound may be encapsulated by any suitable encapsulation technique as known in the art, such as coacervation or spraying, on, and does not' require further explanation here.<br>
By the term "substantially water insoluble" is meant that the transition metal or transition metal compound does not substantially dissolve in water, in particular that it has a<br>
15<br><br>
solubility in water at 20°C of lg/lOOg deionised water or less, preferably 0.5g/100g deionised water or less.<br>
Humectant<br>
The nutrition bars according to all aspects of the invention comprise 2%wt or more of a humectant. For the first aspect of the invention the bars comprise 2% or more of a humectant selected from the group consisting of polyols. For the second and third aspects of the invention the bars comprise 3 to 10%wt and 2%wt or more glycerol humectant respectively.<br>
Any suitable humectant, and mixtures thereof, may be used for the second and third aspects of the invention. However, for all aspects it is preferred that the humectant is selected from  polyols, with diols and triols being preferred, most especially  triols. Suitable diols include sugar alcohol diols. Suitable triols include sugar alcohol triols, glycerol and sorbitol. For all aspects of the invention, especially good results have been obtained when the humectant comprises glycerol, in particular  when the nutrition bars comprise 3 to 10% weight glycerol, especially 4 to 7%wt glycerol.<br>
Other humectants which may be used include fruit pastes such as raisin paste, prune pastes or date paste.<br>
It is preferred that the nutrition bars comprise from 3%wt to 15%wt of humectants, more preferably 3%wt to 15%wt, especially 3%wt to 10%wt.<br>
Aw<br>
According to the	second aspect of the invention, the nutrition<br>
bar has an Aw of	0.45 or less. This is also preferred for the<br>
other aspects of	the invention. For all aspects of the<br>
16<br><br>
invention, it is preferred that the nutrition bar has an Aw of 0.43- or less, most preferably of 0.40 or less. The determination of the Aw is within the normal skill of the skilled person and does not need to be described further here.<br>
Fat/Carbohydrate<br>

Manufacture of bars        <br>
The nutritional bars may be made by known methods provided that any protein nuggets are not exposed to temperatures which cause degradation of their ingredients, especially, the proteins or encapsulant if present.<br>
Extruded nutritional bars may be made by cooking a syrup containing liquid (at ambient temperature) ingredients and then mixing with dry ingredients. The mixture is then extruded onto a conveyor belt and cut with a cutter. Any protein nuggets .are included among the dry ingredients and should only be added to the syrup when the syrup is at a temperature below that at which any of the nugget components degrade. Supercritical fluid extrusion of the bar as a whole at reduced temperatures can also be considered. Syrup ingredients may include components such as corn syrup, glycerine, lecithin and soybean oil or other liquid oils. In addition to any protein nuggets, other dry components include grains, flours, maltodextrin and milk powders may be used.<br>
Nutritional bars in the form of granola bars may be made by cooking the syrup, adding the dry ingredients, blending the syrup and dry ingredients in a blender, feeding the blended mix through rollers and cutting with a cutter.<br>
The bars of the invention may be fully or partially coated,<br>
e.g. with milk chocolate or yogurt flavored coating. Suitable<br>
conventional coating methods may be used.	<br>
Typically, excluding moisture lost during processing, uncoated bars of the invention will be made from 30-70 wt% syrup, especially 35-65%, and 70-30 wt% dry ingredients, especially 65-35 wt%.<br>
23<br><br>
The nutritional bar is preferably'one intended to be used as part of a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
Alternative forms of the nutritional bars are powders, tablets and non-bar meal replacement products. The disclosures herein are equally applicable to these other product forms.<br>
A meal replacement product as referred to herein refers to a product which is intended to/ replace one or more conventional meals per day; they are of a controlled calorie content and are generally eaten as a single product. Examples of meal replacement"products include; liquid products such as milk or soya-based drinks, soluble powders used to prepare those drinks and drinks prepared therefrom) bars, soups, cereal or noodle or pasta-based products, desserts such as rice puddings, custards and the like.  Meal replacement products are generally used by consumers following a calorie controlled diet. The nutritional bars of the invention may also be consumed as meal replacement products.<br>

*i - soy protein nuggets comprising 60%wt soy protein, available from Dupont Protein Technologies Inc., USA. *2 - soy "protein nuggets comprising 80%wt soy protein, available from Dupont Protein Technologies Inc., USA. *3 - vitamin/mineral mix comprising zinc, iron, copper. In bar A there was 2mg of zinc, Img of iron and 0.18mg of copper. In bar B there was 3mg of zinc, 4. 9mg of iron and 0.. 34mg of .  ' copper. For bar A, insoluble copper carbonate encapsulated with sodium alginate (1:9 weight ratio) was used. For bar B, soluble copper gluconate encapsulated with hardened soybean oil was used.<br>
glycerol was added with mixing. Separately the whereafter syrup anc date paste were mixed together and heated to 230oF whereafter   the mixture was added to the glycerol-containing mixture with 1 •  stirring. The mixture was allowed to cool to 180oF when the<br>
Bar A was prepared by the following method of preparation; The glucose syrup, polydextrose syrup, inulin syrup, sugar, Pectose paste,coconut oil and lecithin, were heated together to ahput 250oF, 8§.5 Brix and moisture loss recorded. The    <br>
corn oil was added with mixing. After further cooling to 140oF, the flavours and colourings were added. The dry materials were mixed separately and added to the cooled mixture above with mixing until a uniform mixture was formed. Bars were formed by pressing the mixture into a mould,, and when cooled to room temperature, cutting the cooled mixture into dimensions of 11cm x 3.5cm x 1.9cm.<br>
The bar was coated with the dairy coating which was allowed to set.<br>
26<br><br>
Bar B was prepared by the method for bar A except the first heating stage was to 225-230oF, 83 Brix, that invert syrup was added with the other binder ingredients and the date paste was added with the colourings and flavouring. The bar was cut into dimension of 11cm x 3.5cm x 1.9cm.<br>
Results<br>
The nutrition bars were stored under accelerated storage conditions at either 30oC or 36oC, or, normal storage at 2o0c: to assess them for off flavour development and a deterioration in the organoleptic properties. Bar A was stable after 4 months accelerated storage at :30oC which is the equivalent of more than 12 months storage at 20oC, showing no unacceptable off-flavour development and no unacceptable deterioration in other organoleptic properties. The bars were still chewy, moist and with a good taste after 12 months storage at 20oC No unacceptable browning of the bar was observed. Bar B was stable for only 4 weeks at 36oC and 6 months at 20oC but thereafter quickly produced a nutty off-flavour and browning.<br>
