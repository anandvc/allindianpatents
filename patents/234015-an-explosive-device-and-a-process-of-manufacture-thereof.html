				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for<br>
the manufacture of an explosive device for use<br>
as an explosive charge and/or as a booster for<br>
initiating the main explosive charge in bulk or<br>
in packaged forms.<br>
Boosters generally known in the art are<br>
capable of initiating the main explosive charge or<br>
explosive cartridge. Such boosters comprised<br>
a mixture of trinitrotoluene (TNT) pentaerythritol<br>
tetra nitrate (PETN) in the ratio of 1:1 .<br>
This mixture is filled in a verticle cylindrical<br>
casing having a central housing for accommodating<br>
a detonator cord. Such boosters are mnormally used<br>
for mining applications.<br>
The process for manufacture of booster<br>
comprises in casting/pressing the explosive composition<br>
in the cylindrical casing of 60-85Â°C and allowing<br>
said casing to the step of cooling for setting<br>
said explosive composition therein.<br>
Several distinct disadvantages are associated<br>
with the booster known as such boosters are not<br>
useful to be used as an explosive itself.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that such boosters<br>
do not possess useful applications for blasting<br>
of rock boulders/ hangings in vertical shaft/ tunnels/<br>
mine pillers etc.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the<br>
boosters are not efficient.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the density<br>
of the booster is not uniform due to quick settling<br>
of PETN during the casting process.<br>
Therefore/ a primary object of the present<br>
invention is to propose an explosive device capable<br>
of being used as an explosive charge itself and/or<br>
as a booster for initiating the main explosive<br>
charge.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an explosive device having large surface<br>
area of contact for an economical blasting<br>
applications.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention<br>
is to provide an explosive device capable of<br>
being used to blast rock boulders, hangings in vertical<br>
shaft/ tunnels, mine pillers etc.<br>
Still another object of the present invention<br>
is to provide an explosive device which is efficient<br>
According to this invention there is provided an explosive device comprising a flat<br>
round base housing for accommodating the explosive mixture therein, a central<br>
tubular passage provided along the diameter of said flat base and adapted to<br>
accommodate the detonator or detonating cord/fuse for causing an initiation of a<br>
blast, said central tubular passage dividing the housing into two equal portions.<br>
According to this invention there is also provided a process for manufacture of an<br>
explosive device comprising filling the flat round based housing with the<br>
explosive composition, and subjecting said housing to the step of curing at<br>
ambient temperature<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the booster has a round flat based<br>
housing with a central tubular passage. therein along the diameter of said<br>
housing which divides the housing into two equal portions. The round shape of<br>
the booster provides a maximum surface contact area of the booster with the<br>
target to be exploded. Further, the flat base round housing allows a<br>
concentration of a maximum energy towards the target to be exploded. Also the<br>
housing provides<br>
a physical shape to the explosive disposed in<br>
the housing. The housing is filled with the<br>
explosive composition and then the housing is<br>
allowed to the step of curing for 70 to 90 nours<br>
at an ambient temperature.<br>
A process for the manufacture of an explosive<br>
device according to a preferred embodiment of tne<br>
present invention is herein described and illustrated<br>
in the accompanying drawing and examples wherein:-<br>
Fig.l shows the top perspective view<br>
of the explosive device;<br>
Fig.2 shows the sectional view along section<br>
A,A in fig. 1;<br>
Fig.3 shows the sectional view along section<br>
B,B in fig. 2;<br>
Fig,4 shows the sectional view along A,A<br>
according to another embodiment and<br>
Fig.5 shows the sectional view along section<br>
C,C in fig. 4.<br>
Referring to the drawings particular fig.l<br>
the explosive device for use as an explosive<br>
charge itself or explosive booster for initiating<br>
the main explosive charge in bulk or in packaged<br>
forms has a circular housing 2 having a base 3.<br>
A tubular passage 4 is provided along the<br>
diameter of the base 3 in the nousing 2 for<br>
accommodating the detonator or detonating cord<br>
(not shown)for causing an initiation of the olast.<br>
The central tubular passage 4 devide the housing<br>
into two equal portions 5 and 6 of the semi circular<br>
shape. The tubular passage 4 is casted integrally<br>
with the base 3 of the housing 2 as shown in fig. 3.<br>
According to an embodiment and as shown in fig. 4<br>
the central tubular passage 4 is provided above<br>
the base 3 of the housing 2 and as shown in fig. 5.<br>
Further for the manufacture of the explosive<br>
device the explosive material/composition(not shown)<br>
is filled in the semi circular portions 5 and 6<br>
upto the height of the housing 2. fhe housing 2<br>
duly filled in with the explosive material is<br>
subjected to the step of curing for 70 to 90<br>
hours at an ambient/room temperature. A detonator<br>
or detonat cord(not shown) is provided in the<br>
tubular 4 for blasting purposes of the device/charge<br>
itself or as the booster for initiation of the<br>
bulk amount of the explosive charge.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
1.        180 gm explosive composition was filled in a circular plastic casing of 100<br>
mm diameter and 16 mm height. The housing was allowed to the step of curing<br>
for a period of 72 hours at room temperature. The cured housing was tested for<br>
measuring the cater formation and its strength was 15% higher than the booster<br>
having the known explosive filled therein.<br>
2.       226 gm explosive was filled in a circular plastic casing of 100 mm<br>
diameter and 20 mm height. The housing was allowed to the step of curing for a<br>
period of 75 hours at room temperature. The cured housing was tested for<br>
measuring the cater formation and its strength was 15% higher than the booster<br>
having the known explosive filled therein.<br>
3.       377 gms explosive composition was filled in a circular plastic casing of 125<br>
mm diameter and 27 mm height. The housing was allowed to the step of curing<br>
for a period of 80 hours at room temperature. The cured housing was tested for<br>
measuring the cater formation and its strength was 15% higher than the booster<br>
having the known explosive filled therein.<br>
484 gms explosive composition was filled in a circular plastic casing of 150 mm<br>
diameter and 19 mm height. The housing was allowed to the step of curing for a<br>
period of 73 hours at room temperature. The cured housing was tested for<br>
measuring the cater formation and its strength was 15% higher than the booster<br>
having the explosive composition filled therein.<br>
5. 725 gms explosive composition was filled in a circular plastic casing of 150<br>
mm diameter and 28 mm height. The housing was allowed to the step of curing<br>
for a period of 85 hours at room temperature. The cured housing was tested for<br>
measuring the cater formation and its strength was 15% higher than the booster<br>
having the explosive composition filled therein.<br>
