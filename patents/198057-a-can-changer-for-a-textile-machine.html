				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a can changer for a textile machine used for positioning a sliver can in working position beneath the coiler head of a textile machine and to exchange the filled can after filling.<br>
The use of linear can changers to eject a full can and replace the same with an empty can positioned beneath the coiler head of the textile machine such as a Card or Comber is well known. Such linear can changer essentially consists of a reciprocating slider assembly for receiving and positively positioning an empty can preparatory to subsequent can change operation. The can beneath the coiler is positioned on a drive means and positioned properly with suitable guide means. After filling the can beneath the coiler, the slider assembly reciprocates to replace the full can beneath the coiler with empty can. Soon after that the slider assembly reciprocates back to its home position leaving the empty can on the drive means to receive the sliver delivered by the coiler. The reciprocating motion is generally achieved by using pneumatic cylinders. The pneumatic cylinders used for such application have a large length since it has to transfer the empty can from home position to the position beneath the coiler. This problem becomes more pronounced for large diameter cans. In order to accommodate pneumatic cylinder with longer stroke length, the size of the can changer will also have to be longer.<br>
It is an object of this invention to use pneumatic cylinder with comparatively smaller stroke length, which will reduce the operating cost of the machine, by achieving reduction in the consumption of the<br><br>
compressed air. Compressed air is one of the costliest commodities, used for the operation of the pneumatic cylinder.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a can changer for a textile machine comprising a frame to house a coiler and its associated elements for receiving drafted sliver and deposit the same in a can positioned on a can plate with the help of at least a pair of can guides each having spring loaded lever with rotatably mounted guide roller and another pair of can guides each having pneumatic cylinder, spring loaded lever and rotatably mounted guide roller, a reciprocating slider assembly located within a pair of guides provided on the said frame for sliding the slider assembly to pass the can plate during its reciprocating movement during a can change, the said slider assembly being provided with plurality of can guides each having a spring loaded lever with a rotatably mounted guide roller characterised in that a steel reinforced tape with its ends fixed to opposite sides of the frame and passing through four rollers, the first roller being one of the pair of rollers fixed on a movable plate, the second roller being fixed adjacent and on the same side of the frame on which the first end of the steel reinforced tape is fixed, the third roller being fixed on the side of the frame opposite to the side on which the first end of the steel reinforced tape is fixed and the fourth roller being the other one of the pair of rollers fixed on the movable plate; the said plate with rollers being moveable between the other two rollers fixed to the frame by pneumatic cylinder attached to it, the said slider assembly being rigidly connected to the said steel reinforced tape by means of connectors so that when the said plate is moved through a distance L, by the pneumatic cylinder, the slider assembly moves through a distance 2L<br><br>
in the direction opposite to that of the movement of the piston rod of the pneumatic cylinder.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig. 1 shows the can changer according to the invention with a coiler.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the plan view of the can changer according to the invention with out the coiler portion.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another view of the can changer with out coiler, shown in figure 2 with detail of the can plate and slider.<br>
Fi.g 4 shows the path of the steel reinforced tape with moving plate in one position.<br>
Fi.g 5 shows the path of the steel reinforced tape with moving plate in a another position.<br>
The can changer essentially consist of a frame (1) to house the coiler and its associated elements for receiving the drafted sliver and to deposit the same beneath the can positioned on a can plate (2). Plurality of can guides (3,4, 5, 6) are fitted on the can changer frame (1) to locate the can beneath a coiler (C) precisely at the required location on the can plate. The can guides (3,4) comprising of levers which are loaded with torsion springs. On the levers guide rollers are rotateably mounted. The can guides are disposed to swing in a particular direction only to allow the<br><br>
entry of empty cans, and retain the can properly, during working of the machine. The can guides (5,6) comprises pneumatic cylinder, lever and rotateably mounted rollers to allow free movement of the can resting on the can plate, in the direction opposite to that of the empty can loading, during can change cycle. These can guides (5, 6), in conjunction with guides (3,4) will ensure that the can, beneath the coiler is located properly in position, on the can plate during working of the textile machine.<br>
The reciprocating slider assembly (7) is housed within a pair of guides (8) provided on the frame (1) to facilitate easy sliding of the slider assembly to pass over the can plate (2) during its reciprocating movement during a can change. The slider assembly is provided with plurality of can guides (9,10,11,12) comprising levers loaded with torsion springs. On the levers, guide rollers are rotateably mounted. The can guides are arranged to allow swinging in a particular direction only. Thus the entry of empty cans are allowed and they are retained in proper position during the can change cycle. Rollers (14,15) mounted on anti-friction bearings and disposed on the top of the plate (13). Rollers (16,17) are mounted on anti-friction bearings and also fitted on the frame (1).<br>
A pneumatic cylinder (18) is fitted on the frame (1). The yoke, connected to the piston rod of the pneumatic cylinder (18) is fastened to the underside of the plate (13). A steel reinforced tape (19) is laid as shown in the figure 2. The tape (19) envelops the rollers (14,15,16,17) as shown in figure 2 and the free ends of the same is rigidly fastened to the frame.<br><br>
The slider assembly is rigidly connected to the tape through connectors (20,21).<br>
Once the can kept underneath the coiler is filled with the pre determined length of sliver, a suitable switching means in conjunction with counting means may be provided for stopping the machine and to initiate the can change cycle. To facilitate can changing , the piston of the pneumatic cylinder assembly is actuated by electro pneumatic means. By virtue of the arrangement of pulleys and tape, as explained, for a displacement of distance L of the piston rod, the slider assembly (7) is displaced by a distance 2L in the direction opposite to that of the piston rod movement. The stroke length of the cylinder is so set that the slider assembly (7) along with the empty can kept on it, and held in position by the guides, reaches its pre determined position. The empty can is positioned exactly beneath the coiler to receive the sliver. During the process of the movement of the slider assembly along with the empty can, the full can already present on the can plate beneath the coiler is pushed out. Sensing means are provided to control the forward movement of the piston. Once the slider assembly reaches its predetermined position, the forward movement of the piston ceases and the backward movement of the piston is started. During the backward movement of the piston, the guide assemblies (3,4,5,6) retain the empty can on the can plate and the slider assembly alone reaches its home position.<br><br><br><br><br>
