SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
BASE STATION, MOBILE STATION AND POWER<br>
CONTROL METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to<br>
radio communication. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a base station, a mobile<br>
station and a method for controlling transmission<br>
power of a shared control channel used for packet<br>
switching type communication.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a mobile communication system such as<br>
IMT-2000, transmission power control is performed<br>
from the viewpoint of enlargement of circuit<br>
capacity and economy of battery of a mobile station<br>
and the like. For example, quality measurement of a<br>
channel is performed in a receiving side, and a<br>
transmission power control (TPC) bit is transmitted<br>
by a return channel (DPCCH, for example) such that<br>
the channel that is being received satisfies desired<br>
quality. As a result, the transmission power is<br>
updated by 1 dB, for example, and quality<br>
measurement and transmitting/receiving of the TPC<br>
bit are repeated, so that the transmission power can<br>
be gradually changed to be closer to an optimal<br>
value. That is, in a communication of a circuit<br>
switching scheme, an individual channel is assigned<br>
specifically to a mobile station, and the<br>
transmission power of the mobile station is<br>
gradually adjusted based on a temporally continuing<br>
history on the transmission power. Such<br>
transmission power control is described in a non-<br>
patent document 1, for example.<br>

mobile communication scheme", MARUZEN, pp.126-128<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
In a future mobile communication system, a<br>
packet switching type communication scheme is<br>
adopted in place of the conventional circuit<br>
switching type communication scheme. Radio<br>
resources of a packet form are shared by a plurality<br>
of users, and availability of the radio resources is<br>
properly scheduled in a base station. In such a<br>
mobile communication system, there is not only a<br>
mobile station to which the radio resources are<br>
actually assigned but also a mobile station that<br>
desires assignment but to which the resources are<br>
not yet assigned. In addition, such a situation<br>
arises in circuits of both of uplink and downlink.<br>
For causing a mobile station placed in various<br>
operation situations to operate properly, it is<br>
necessary that the shared control channel is<br>
transmitted well with a constant quality. Thus, it<br>
is necessary that the transmission power of the<br>
shared control channel is properly controlled. But,<br>
the above-mentioned transmission power control<br>
method of the circuit switching type cannot be used<br>
as it is, and a useful method is not yet established.<br>
An object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a base station, a mobile station and a power<br>
control method for controlling transmission power of<br>
a shared control channel using a method suitable for<br>
packet switching type communication.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
In the present invention, a base station,<br>
is used, that includes: means that derives a<br>
transmission power of a mobile station based on<br>
receive quality of an uplink pilot channel; means<br><br>
-3-<br>
that reports the derived transmission power to the<br>
mobile station; and means that receives a control<br>
channel transmitted by the mobile station according<br>
to the reported information.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention,<br>
transmission power of the shared control channel can<br>
be controlled using a method applicable to packet<br>
switching type communication.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, relative or absolute power by which the<br>
mobile station needs to change its transmission<br>
power is derived based on relationship between<br>
receive quality of an uplink pilot channel and<br>
receive quality that a control channel needs to<br>
satisfy or a transmission power value of the pilot<br>
channel. Thus derived power is reported to the<br>
mobile station, so that uplink transmission power is<br>
properly controlled. Accordingly, without using the<br>
transmission power history over a past continuous<br>
time, the mobile station receives an instruction on<br><br>
-5-<br>
transmission power from the base station each time<br>
when sending a packet so as to be able to adjust the<br>
transmission power.<br>
When the mobile station has not yet<br>
received the instruction, an uplink pilot channel is<br>
transmitted after a procedure. In the procedure, a<br>
pilot channel and a transmission power is reported<br>
to the mobile station using a downlink, and the<br>
mobile station derives the transmission power based<br>
on an average propagation loss between the mobile<br>
station and the base station. The uplink pilot<br>
channel is transmitted using the derived power, and<br>
it is received by the base station. Accordingly,<br>
the base station can properly determine a<br>
transmission power of the mobile station of next<br>
time based on the pilot channel transmitted from the<br>
mobile station.<br>
The propagation loss may be derived from<br>
receive quality of a downlink pilot channel and the<br>
transmission power value.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the base station receives both or one of<br>
a first pilot channel in which a symbol mapping<br>
pattern is constant and a second pilot channel in<br>
which a symbol mapping pattern is variable. By<br>
preparing a plurality of kinds of uplink pilot<br>
channels, both of channel estimation accuracy and<br>
transmission efficiency of information can be<br>
considered.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the mobile station that is transmitting<br>
traffic data is caused to transmit the control<br>
channel using a power derived based on the uplink<br>
pilot channel. The mobile station that is not yet<br>
transmitting traffic data is caused to transmit the<br>
control channel using a power derived based on the<br>
average propagation loss. Since the number of<br><br>
-6-<br>
mobile stations that are transmitting traffic data<br>
is relatively small, efficiency of power control can<br>
be improved by applying the CQI based TPC only for<br>
the mobile stations.<br>
The base station may further includes<br>
means that determines a frequency chunk usable for<br>
the mobile station to transmit traffic data and<br>
determines a transmission power of the mobile<br>
station. The transmission power and the frequency<br>
chunk may be determined such that the transmission<br>
power exceeds a predetermined threshold and that<br>
more chunks are used. Accordingly, resources of the<br>
shared data channel can be easily and properly<br>
assigned.<br>
A base station according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention includes means that<br>
transmits a common pilot channel; means that derives<br>
a plurality of transmission powers of a shared<br>
control channel based on receive quality of a<br>
plurality of common pilot channels reported by an<br>
uplink; and means that reports the shared control<br>
channel to a plurality of mobile stations using the<br>
derived transmission powers.<br>
The derived transmission powers may be<br>
separately reported to the mobile stations receiving<br>
traffic data. Accordingly, transmission power can<br>
be controlled for each mobile station. One of the<br>
derived transmission powers may be reported to the<br>
mobile stations that are receiving traffic data.<br>
Accordingly, the plurality of control stations can<br>
be controlled with a same transmission power. The<br>
transmission power may be a transmission power<br>
corresponding to a mobile station that reports the<br>
worst CQI among the plurality of mobile stations.<br>
The shared control channel may be reported<br>
to a mobile station that is not receiving traffic<br>
data using a predetermined transmission power.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Accordingly, transmission power control for the<br>
shared control channel can be performed also for<br>
mobile stations that desire only transmission of the<br>
uplink traffic data.<br>
The base station may include a coder for<br>
coding data for one or more mobile station as a unit,<br>
and the data for one or more mobile station may be<br>
transmitted using a same transmission power. By<br>
aligning the unit of coding with the range of data<br>
for which same transmission power control is<br>
performed, a combination of strength of error<br>
correction capability and excess or deficiency of<br>
transmission power can be properly set. For example,<br>
coding (decoding) can be simplified without excess<br>
or deficiency of power, and on the other hand,<br>
transmission power can be made large while error<br>
correction capability is high.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
In a downlink, a common pilot channel is<br>
announced to all users from a base station, and a<br>
mobile station that desires downlink data<br>
communication reports receive quality of the common<br>
pilot channel to the base station, so that it can be<br>
expected that the base station determines a<br>
transmission power of the downlink shared control<br>
channel. However, in an uplink, the common pilot<br>
channel cannot be used. This embodiment is<br>
contrived in view of the problem. In the following,<br>
a transmission power control method for an uplink<br>
shared control channel in the packet switching type<br>
mobile communication system is described.<br>
Fig.1 shows a base station according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The base<br>
station includes a modulation and coding unit 11<br>
that performs multilevel modulation on data to be<br>
transmitted and performs channel coding, a<br>
multiplexing unit (MUX) 12 that multiplexes a<br><br>
-8-<br>
modulated signal and a pilot channel, and a radio<br>
unit (RF) 13 that converts an multiplexed signal to<br>
a signal format for transmitting from an antenna,<br>
and further includes a transmission power<br>
determination unit 14 that determines a transmission<br>
power of a mobile station based on information<br>
received from an upper apparatus of the base station<br>
or from another mobile station or based on base<br>
station data.<br>
Fig.2 shows a mobile station according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. The mobile<br>
station includes a radio unit (RF) 21 that converts<br>
a signal format of a signal received by an antenna,<br>
a demultiplexing unit (DeMUX) 22 that demultiplexes<br>
a pilot channel and other channel from the received<br>
signal, a pilot channel processing unit 23 that<br>
performs channel estimation using the pilot channel<br>
and performs measurement of transmission loss and<br>
the like, and a demodulation and decoding unit 24<br>
that demodulates the received data and performs<br>
error correction decoding.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flowchart showing an uplink<br>
transmission power control method according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, a shared control channel of a fixed<br>
information rate and a shared data channel of a<br>
variable rate are prepared as uplink channels. The<br>
transmission power control method described below<br>
can be used for both of the shared control channel<br>
and the shared data channel. Since the transmission<br>
rate of the shared control channel is constant, it<br>
is essential to control the transmission power of<br>
the mobile station for controlling receive quality<br>
of the shared control channel. On the other hand,<br>
for controlling receive quality of the shared data<br>
channel, there a choice of adjusting the<br>
transmission rate in addition to controlling the<br><br>
-9-<br>
transmission power of the mobile station. The<br>
transmission rate can be adjusted by changing the<br>
number of levels of the multilevel modulation or<br>
changing a coding rate of data. By the way,<br>
although the transmission rate of the shared control<br>
channel is fixed to be constant in this embodiment<br>
for simplifying explanation, the transmission rate<br>
of the shared control channel may be changed in<br>
another embodiment.<br>
In step 1, a downlink pilot channel is<br>
transmitted from the base station to the mobile<br>
station, and a transmission power Pt of the pilot<br>
channel is also transmitted via an annunciation<br>
channel or a broadcast channel (BCH).<br>
As indicated as step 2, the mobile station<br>
receives the downlink pilot channel and the<br>
transmission power for a period to calculate an<br>
average propagation loss L. The propagation loss L<br>
is mainly determined by distance variation and<br>
shadowing, and in general, the propagation loss L is<br>
not largely different between uplink and downlink<br>
when being averaged over a proper time. For example,<br>
by averaging the receive quality over a relatively<br>
long period such as a period of one or more frame,<br>
influence of instantaneous variation such as fading<br>
is removed. Fig.10 exemplary shows a relationship<br>
between instantaneous receive SIR and an average<br>
receive SIR. In this embodiment, although the<br>
receive quality is measured as SINR, it may be<br>
measured as SIR, or measured as other amount<br>
indicating quality. A target quality SIRt that the<br>
base station aims when the base station receives the<br>
uplink channel is represented as a following<br>
equation.<br>
SIRt = Pup+L-I0 [dB]<br>
In this equation, Pup indicates a transmission power<br>
(the control object at present) transmitted by the<br><br>
-10-<br>
mobile station, I0 indicates an interference power<br>
for an uplink channel observed at the base station.<br>
The propagation loss L is represented as a<br>
difference between the transmission power Pt in the<br>
base station and the receive power Pr in the mobile<br>
station. The annunciation channel announced from<br>
the base station includes the transmission power Pt<br>
at the base station, the uplink interference power<br>
±o and the target quality SIRt.<br>
In step 3 of Fig.3, a pilot channel is<br>
transmitted from the mobile station to the base<br>
station. The transmission power at this time is a<br>
power that compensates for propagation loss<br>
calculated in step 2, and is not a power that<br>
compensates for instantaneous fading received on an<br>
uplink propagation route.<br>
In step 4, the base station measures a<br>
difference between the receive quality (receive<br>
SINR) of the received uplink pilot channel and the<br>
required quality (required SINR) expected for the<br>
pilot channel. The power indicated by the<br>
difference (power difference) indicates a power<br>
amount (relative power value) by which the mobile<br>
station needs to change its transmission power from<br>
the current value such that quality of channel<br>
received by the base station becomes the required<br>
quality. When deriving the power difference, the<br>
base station may use a table on receive SIR,<br>
required SIR, MCS number and power difference by<br>
which power should be changed from the current value.<br>
The MCS number specifies a combination of the number<br>
of levels of multilevel modulation and a coding rate.<br>
Fig.4 shows a table example defining a<br>
correspondence relationship among channel status<br>
information (CQI: Channel Quality Indicator)<br>
reported from the base station to the mobile station,<br>
MCS number and transmission power of the mobile<br><br>
-11-<br>
station. The channel status information is measured<br>
as SIR typically. In the example of Fig.4, MCS<br>
number and transmission power can be derived based<br>
on CQI (SIR) measured by the base station and<br>
reported from the base station. Fig.5 shows a table<br>
example that can be used in a case where MCS number,<br>
instead of the CQI information, is reported from the<br>
base station to the mobile station. Figs. 4 and 5<br>
show merely examples of a table used for determining<br>
the transmission power, and the transmission power<br>
may be determined based on other correspondence<br>
relationship.<br>
In step 5, the base station reports, to<br>
the mobile station, the power difference by which<br>
the mobile station needs to change its transmission<br>
power from the current value using a downlink<br>
control channel.<br>
In step 6, the mobile station adjusts the<br>
transmission power based on the instructed<br>
information reported by the control channel. The<br>
adjusting amount in this case is different from one<br>
in control by TPC bit (not up and down by 1 dB), but<br>
is an amount for adjusting the current value to a<br>
target value at one time.<br>
In step 7, the control channel is<br>
transmitted using an adjusted transmission power.<br>
This transmission power is a value for compensating<br>
for not only the propagation loss but also minute<br>
variation such as fading. After that, by repeating<br>
the procedure from the step 3 to the step 7 or<br>
repeating the procedure of steps 7, 4 and 6 for each<br>
packet, an uplink transmission power suitable for<br>
the mobile station can be properly kept. However,<br>
in the repeated step 3, a pilot channel accompanying<br>
the uplink control channel is used.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
In the second embodiment of the present<br><br>
-12-<br>
invention, processes in steps 3, 4 and 5 in Fig.3<br>
are different. Since processes of other steps are<br>
the same, overlapping explanations are not provided.<br>
In step 3, the mobile station transmits a<br>
transmission power value of a pilot channel in<br>
addition to transmitting the pilot channel to the<br>
base station.<br>
In step 4, the base station measures<br>
receive quality (receive SINR) of the received pilot<br>
channel. The base station compares the receive<br>
quality and the required quality, and calculates a<br>
power value indicating the difference. A sum of the<br>
power value and the transmission power value<br>
indicates an absolute value of a power by which the<br>
mobile station transmits a channel such that quality<br>
of the channel received by the base station becomes<br>
the required quality. In the same way as the case<br>
of embodiment 1, the power (power difference)<br>
indicated as the difference indicates a power amount<br>
(relative power amount) by which the mobile station<br>
needs to change its transmission power from the<br>
current value such that quality of the channel<br>
received by the base station becomes the required<br>
quality.<br>
In step 5, one or both of the relative<br>
power value and the absolute power value is reported<br>
from the base station to the mobile station using a<br>
downlink.<br>
In step 6, the mobile station adjusts the<br>
transmission power according to the instructed<br>
information reported by the control channel.<br>
In step 7, the control channel is<br>
transmitted using the adjusted transmission power.<br>
After that, by repeating the procedure from the step<br>
3 to the step 7 or repeating the procedure of steps<br>
7, 4 and 6 for each packet, the uplink transmission<br>
power suitable for the mobile station can be<br><br>
-13-<br>
properly kept.<br>
[Embodiment 3]<br>
The pilot channel of the uplink is an<br>
individual pilot channel that is different for each<br>
mobile station and that is used for channel<br>
estimation, receive quality measurement,<br>
synchronization acquisition and the like for the<br>
uplink. For the purpose of precisely monitoring<br>
communication status that changes every moment, it<br>
is better to transmit many pilot channels. However,<br>
since the pilot channel is a known signal, the more<br>
the transmission amount of the pilot channel is, the<br>
more the transmission efficiency becomes lowered.<br>
In addition, it is not necessary to perform all of<br>
the channel estimation, receive quality measurement,<br>
synchronization acquisition for uplink with same<br>
frequency.<br>
From this viewpoint, in the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention, two types of<br>
uplink pilot channels are prepared, in which one is<br>
a reference pilot channel that does not necessarily<br>
accompany the shared control channel, and another<br>
one is a pilot channel for channel estimation that<br>
accompanies the shared data channel.<br>
The reference pilot channel may be used<br>
for channel estimation, receive quality measurement<br>
and synchronization acquisition for uplink, and it<br>
is similar to conventional one in terms of purpose<br>
of use. However, it is different from conventional<br>
one at least in the point that it is transmitted<br>
while transmission power control of the embodiments<br>
1 and 2 are being performed such that the receive<br>
quality is kept. In addition, it is necessary to<br>
estimate the channel so as to compensate for the<br>
propagation route for demodulating the shared<br>
control channel. For that purpose, the reference<br>
pilot channel is transmitted accompanying the shared<br><br>
-14-<br>
control channel. On the other hand, for measuring<br>
uplink receive quality, the reference pilot channel<br>
may be transmitted independently without<br>
accompanying the shared control channel. However,<br>
the mapping position of the symbol is fixed<br>
beforehand as one kind. Fig.6(A) shows a situation<br>
in which the reference pilot channel accompanying<br>
the shared control channel and the independent<br>
reference pilot channel are transmitted.<br>
The pilot channel for channel estimation<br>
accompanies the shared data channel and is used for<br>
channel estimation. (B)-(D) in Fig.6 show examples<br>
of mapping of the pilot channel for channel<br>
estimation. Since the mobile station can move at<br>
various high and low speeds, there may be a case in<br>
which time variation of channel status is large<br>
depending on the mobile station. In this case, as<br>
shown in Figs.6(C) and (D) instead of Fig.6(B), man<br>
pilot channels for channel estimation are mapped in<br>
the time axis direction so that channel estimation<br>
accuracy for a user moving at high speed can be<br>
improved. For a mobile station that is not moving<br>
at high speed, by mapping the pilot channel for<br>
channel estimation as few as possible, transmission<br>
efficiency for information can be improved. Since<br>
the pilot channel for channel estimation is<br>
transmitted or not transmitted, it can be referred<br>
to as a pilot channel for capturing a reference<br>
pilot channel that is always being transmitted.<br>
According to the present embodiment, by providing a<br>
plurality of types of pilot channels and by<br>
adaptively mapping them according to use purpose or<br>
communication situation, channel estimation accurac<br>
and information transmission efficiency can be<br>
improved.<br>
[Embodiment 4]<br>
As mentioned above, in the mobile<br><br>
-15-<br>
communication system, there are not only a mobile<br>
station to which radio resources are actually<br>
assigned but also a mobile station that desires<br>
assignment but to which radio resources are not yet<br>
assigned. Such a situation occurs in both of uplink<br>
and downlink circuits. Therefore, the shared<br>
control channel includes information on these<br>
various statuses.<br>
Fig.7 shows information items that may be<br>
included in an uplink shared control channel. In<br>
the control information shown in four lines of (1)-<br>
(4), (1) and (2) indicate information on downlink<br>
data transmission by the shared data channel, and<br>
(3) and (4) indicate information on uplink data<br>
transmission by the shared data channel.<br>
The item (1) indicates information of a<br>
response transmitted by a mobile station when the<br>
mobile station that is actually performing downlink<br>
traffic data transmission receives a downlink shared<br>
data channel. When the mobile station can properly<br>
receive the downlink shared data channel, the mobile<br>
station returns an acknowledgement (ACK) to the base<br>
station, and when the mobile station cannot properly<br>
receive the downlink shared data channel, the mobile<br>
station returns a negative acknowledgement (NACK) to<br>
the base station.<br>
The item (2) indicates CQI information<br>
reported, to the base station, by the mobile station<br>
that is not currently performing downlink traffic<br>
data transmission but wants to perform data<br>
transmission in the future. The mobile station that<br>
desires to perform the uplink data transmission<br>
measures receive quality of a pilot channel included<br>
in the annunciation channel, and reports the<br>
measurement result as the CQI information to the<br>
base station to request scheduling of next time.<br>
The item (3) indicates information<br><br>
-16-<br>
accompanying the uplink shared data channel<br>
transmitted by the mobile station that is actually<br>
performing uplink traffic data transmission. This<br>
accompanying information is used for demodulation of<br>
shared data channel in the base station, for example.<br>
More particularly, the accompanying information may<br>
include modulation scheme, transport block size,<br>
retransmission control information, and identifier<br>
of the mobile station and the like. The modulation<br>
scheme is information for specifying a scheme such<br>
as QPSK, 16 QAM and the like, and it may be<br>
represented as a number of levels of multilevel<br>
modulation. The retransmission control information<br>
may include, for example, a process number for<br>
specifying a position of a packet in hybrid ARQ<br>
(HARQ), a redundancy format of a retransmitted bit,<br>
a new data indicator indicating whether a packet is<br>
new data or a retransmitted packet, or the like.<br>
The item (4) indicates information<br>
reported to the base station by a mobile station<br>
that is currently not performing traffic data<br>
transmission but desires to perform data<br>
transmission in the future. This information may<br>
include information on a transmission power or a<br>
buffer status of the mobile station. For example,<br>
transmission power information may include<br>
information indicating how large a power is by which<br>
the mobile station transmits the shared control<br>
channel, information (maximum transmission power)<br>
indicating how large the power is at the maximum by<br>
which the mobile station can transmit it, or the<br>
like. The buffer status may be represented as a<br>
data amount (a filling factor of a buffer) stored in<br>
a transmission buffer of the mobile station. For<br>
example, the larger the data amount is, the larger<br>
the priority of the scheduling may be set.<br>
In the present embodiment, the base<br><br>
-17-<br>
satiation determines which of the items (l)-(4)<br>
corresponds to transmission contents of the shared<br>
control channel. As a result, as to a mobile<br>
station ((1), (3)) that is actually performing<br>
traffic data transmission, the transmission power of<br>
the uplink shared control channel is controlled by<br>
the method described in the embodiment 1 or 2. That<br>
is, the base station measures receive quality of a<br>
pilot channel received from the mobile station, and<br>
determines and reports the transmission power of the<br>
mobile station according to the quality, so that the<br>
mobile station transmits the uplink shared control<br>
channel according to the reported information (this<br>
transmission power control method is to be referred<br>
to as "CQI based TPC" for the sake of convenience).<br>
On the other hand, as to a mobile station<br>
((2), (4)) that is not currently performing uplink<br>
traffic data transmission but desires to perform the<br>
data transmission in the future, the transmission<br>
power of the uplink shared control channel is<br>
controlled by the method described in steps 2 and 3<br>
in Fig.3. That is, the mobile station receives the<br>
pilot channel and the annunciation channel for a<br>
period so as to calculate an average propagation<br>
loss, so that the uplink shared control channel is<br>
transmitted to compensate for the propagation loss<br>
and compensate for interference power at the base<br>
station (this transmission power control method is<br>
to be referred to as "slow TPC" for the sake of<br>
convenience).<br>
Since the transmission power is adaptively<br>
changed at every moment in the CQI based TPC,<br>
calculation load for determining it is large.<br>
Therefore, if control of the transmission power of<br>
the uplink shared control channel is performed based<br>
on the CQI based TPC for all of the mobile stations,<br>
there is a fear that calculation load and delay in<br><br>
-18-<br>
the base station become very large. On the other<br>
hand, as to the uplink shared control channel for<br>
the mobile station, corresponding to (2) and (4),<br>
that is not yet performing traffic data transmission,<br>
the importance is lower than that corresponding to<br>
(1) and (3). For example, when the acknowledgement<br>
(ACK) of retransmission control is erroneously<br>
determined, useless traffic increases to exert a bad<br>
influence on the system. But, even though the<br>
buffer status of the mobile station is erroneously<br>
determined, large bad effect does not arise. In<br>
addition, there is a possibility that the number of<br>
mobile stations related to (2) and (4) becomes far<br>
larger than that of mobile stations related to (1)<br>
and (3). From this viewpoint, in the present<br>
embodiment, the CQI based TPC is performed for the<br>
mobile stations related to (1) and (3), so that<br>
accurate transmission power control that can address<br>
instantaneous fading variation is performed. Then,<br>
slow TPC is performed for the mobile stations<br>
related to (2) and (4) in which instantaneous fading<br>
is not compensated for, and slow transmission power<br>
control is performed such that signal quality is<br>
maintained averagely. Accordingly, the CQI based<br>
TPC described in embodiments 1 and 2 can be<br>
efficiently used.<br>
[Embodiment 5]<br>
Fig.8 indicates a radio resource<br>
assignment example for an uplink shared data channel<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Each procedure shown in Fig.8 is<br>
executed in the base station. In the present<br>
embodiment, there is a mobile station that is<br>
actually transmitting traffic data using an uplink<br>
shared data channel. This mobile station transmits<br>
the uplink shared control channel or the pilot<br>
channel or the like including the information item<br><br>
-19-<br>
of (3) shown in Fig.7 in the embodiment 4. The base<br>
station receives the pilot channel transmitted from<br>
the mobile station, and the flow of Fig.8 goes to<br>
step 10.<br>
In step 10, receive quality of the pilot<br>
channel is measured as CQI information.<br>
In step 12, a band of the uplink shared<br>
data channel for the mobile station is determined<br>
based on the measured CQI information and the<br>
transmission power information received from the<br>
mobile station. In the present embodiment, the<br>
usable band is divided into a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks each including one or more sub-carrier.<br>
Typically, the present invention is used for a radio<br>
communication system of an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. The frequency<br>
block is also referred to as a frequency chunk or<br>
simply a chunk. One or more frequency chunk may be<br>
used as various references such as a unit of<br>
resource assignment, a unit of retransmission, or a<br>
unit of coding. In the present embodiment, one<br>
frequency chunk is set as a unit of resource<br>
assignment.<br>
Figs.9A-9D show a plurality of candidates<br>
considered when assigning a band. The lateral axis<br>
of each figure corresponds to frequency f, and the<br>
vertical axis corresponds to power P. As shown in<br>
Fig.9A, a band of 10 MHz is divided to four<br>
frequency chunks of 2.5MHz. In step 12 of Fig.8,<br>
resources are determined such that the power becomes<br>
greater than a power threshold Pth derived from the<br>
transmission power information of the mobile station<br>
and that a band as wide as possible is kept (the<br>
band is determined such that the transmission power<br>
per one chunk is equal to or greater than the<br>
threshold and that the band occupies a wider<br>
transmission bandwidth.) For example, as to<br><br>
-20-<br>
transmission power of the mobile station reported<br>
from the mobile station, assuming that relationship<br>
between the power threshold Pth and the frequency<br>
chunk becomes each of ones in Fig.9. In this case,<br>
in the resource assignments shown in Figs.9A and 9B,<br>
since the power is less than the threshold, these<br>
two candidates are excluded. Although each of<br>
Figs.9C and 9D exceeds the threshold of the power,<br>
since the one shown in Fig.9C occupies a wider<br>
frequency band, it is determined to be an optimal<br>
resource assignment method.<br>
In step 14 of Fig.8, a MCS number<br>
corresponding to the power determined in step 12 is<br>
selected.<br>
In step 16, information on the MCS number<br>
derived in step 14, the band (information for<br>
specifying frequency chunk) determined in step 12<br>
and transmission power and the like is reported to<br>
the mobile station via the downlink shared control<br>
channel. Accordingly, the mobile station can<br>
properly transmit the uplink shared data channel.<br>
According to the present embodiment, as shown in<br>
Fig.10, an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)<br>
scheme is adopted for addressing instantaneous<br>
fading, and the MCS number is adaptively updated for<br>
each TTI in the example shown in the figure. By<br>
adopting AMC in addition to the slow TPC for<br>
bringing the average receive SIR close to a target<br>
value, transmission quality of the uplink shared<br>
data channel can be improved.<br>
[Embodiment 6]<br>
Uplink transmission power control is<br>
described in the first to fifth embodiments, and a<br>
transmission power control method for a downlink<br>
shared control channel is described in the sixth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Fig.11 is a<br>
flowchart showing a transmission power control<br><br>
-21-<br>
method according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in step 112, the base station<br>
transmits a common pilot channel to mobile stations<br>
under the base station. The common pilot channel is<br>
different from the pilot channel that is transmitted<br>
by each mobile station via an uplink in that the<br>
common pilot channel is commonly transmitted to all<br>
of the mobile stations. In step 114, the mobile<br>
station measures receive signal quality as CQI<br>
information based on the received common pilot<br>
channel. The mobile station performing downlink<br>
data transmission reports the measured CQI<br>
information to the base station using the uplink<br>
shared control channel in step 116. In step 118,<br>
the base station determines a transmission power of<br>
the downlink shared control channel based on the<br>
reported CQI information. Correspondence<br>
relationship between CQI information and<br>
transmission power shown in Fig.12 is prepared<br>
beforehand. In step 120, the base station transmits<br>
the downlink shared control channel using the<br>
determined power in step 118. Accordingly, the<br>
transmission power of the downlink shared control<br>
channel can be determined based on the CQI<br>
information measured in the mobile station (this<br>
method is to be referred to as "CQI based downlink<br>
TPC" for the sake of convenience).<br>
Fig.13 indicates information items that<br>
may be included in the downlink shared control<br>
channel. These information items are largely<br>
classified as control information on downlink (left<br>
column) and control information on uplink (right<br>
column). In addition, as shown in the left side of<br>
the figure, the control information is largely<br>
classified as one on physical layer (upper side) and<br>
one on layer 2 (L2) (lower side). The control<br>
information on the downlink may include demodulation<br><br>
-22-<br>
information, scheduling information and<br>
retransmission control information (HARQ). The<br>
demodulation information may include chunk<br>
assignment information, data modulation information<br>
and transport block size information. The chunk<br>
assignment information is information for specifying<br>
a frequency chunk to be assigned to the downlink<br>
shared data channel to the mobile station. The data<br>
modulation information is information for specifying<br>
a modulation scheme applied to the shared data<br>
channel, and it may be specified by the MCS number.<br>
The transport block size information indicates the<br>
number of bits that are transmitted, and can be<br>
associated with coding rate, and may be specified by<br>
the MCS number. The scheduling information may<br>
include identification information for identifying<br>
the mobile station. The retransmission control<br>
information may include a process number of a<br>
transmitted packet, information indicating<br>
redundancy format, and a new data indicator. The<br>
new data indicator is an indicator that indicates<br>
whether a packet is a new packet or a retransmitted<br>
packet.<br>
The control information on the uplink may<br>
include a transmission power control bit, a<br>
transmission timing control bit, a response bit of a<br>
contention-based channel, scheduling information and<br>
retransmission control information (HARQ) and the<br>
like. The transmission power control bit and the<br>
transmission timing control bit indicate a<br>
transmission power and a transmission timing when<br>
transmitting the uplink shared data channel, and<br>
these are determined and reported in scheduling by<br>
the base station. The contention-based channel is a<br>
channel that may be transmitted from the mobile<br>
station to the base station without scheduling, and<br>
that is a channel that may cause contention between<br><br>
-23-<br>
the mobile station and another mobile station. The<br>
contention-based channel may be a fast access<br>
channel and the like that includes a reservation<br>
packet for requesting scheduling of the shared data<br>
channel, traffic data of small size or control data.<br>
The control information includes response<br>
information (ACK/NACK), as response contents,<br>
indicating whether the contention-based channel that<br>
is transmitted from the mobile station is properly<br>
received by the base station. The scheduling<br>
information may include identification information<br>
of the mobile station, chunk assignment information,<br>
data modulation information and transport block size<br>
and the like. These are similar to those described<br>
for the downlink, but these are different in that<br>
these are information on the uplink. The<br>
retransmission control information (HARQ) includes<br>
information (ACK/NACK) indicating whether<br>
information transmitted from the mobile station to<br>
the base station is properly received by the base<br>
station.<br>
The mobile station that receives the<br>
control information on the downlink (left side)<br>
actually receives traffic data using the downlink<br>
shared data channel. Therefore, since the number of<br>
that kind of mobile stations is the maximum number<br>
of users that can be assigned at most, the number of<br>
the mobile stations is not enormous. Therefore, the<br>
power of the downlink shared control channel may be<br>
controlled using the CQI based downlink TPC for each<br>
mobile station. Alternatively, "CQI based downlink<br>
TPC" for a mobile station corresponding to the worst<br>
CQI among a plurality of mobile stations may be<br>
applied to other mobile stations. On the other hand,<br>
mobile stations that receive control information on<br>
uplink (right side) include mobile stations that<br>
desire to transmit traffic data using the uplink<br><br>
-24-<br>
shared data channel currently or in the future. In<br>
the mobile stations, as to mobile stations that<br>
receives control information on the downlink, power<br>
control using the CQI based downlink TPC may be<br>
performed for each mobile station like the case of<br>
downlink, or "CQI based TPC" for a mobile station<br>
corresponding to bad CQI may be similarly applied to<br>
other mobile stations. However, there may be many<br>
mobile stations (including mobile stations desiring<br>
only uplink data transmission) that do not receive<br>
downlink traffic data currently or in the future.<br>
In addition, since it is not necessary that such<br>
mobile stations report receive quality of a received<br>
pilot channel to the base station as CQI information,<br>
it is difficult to perform CQI based downlink TPC.<br>
In the present embodiment, as to such mobile station,<br>
the shared control channel is transmitted using a<br>
power that is fixed to be a constant value.<br>
Fig.14 shows an example of power control<br>
according to the present embodiment. In this<br>
example, users #l-#3 among five users are receiving<br>
downlink traffic data. Therefore, the downlink<br>
shared control channel for the user #1 may be<br>
controlled by the CQI based downlink TPC, and the<br>
transmission power is indicated as Pi. For the<br>
users #2 and #3, in the same way, they may be<br>
controlled by the CQI based downlink TPC separately,<br>
and the transmission powers are represented as P2<br>
and P3 respectively. Alternatively, transmission<br>
power control for a mobile station that reports the<br>
worst CQI among the three users may be applied to<br>
other mobile stations. The transmission power Pa<br>
(a=l,2 or 3) in this case is made common to the<br>
users #1 - #3. In addition, in the example shown in<br>
the figure, the remaining users #4 and #5 in the<br>
five users do not receive downlink traffic data, so<br>
that the downlink shared control channel for these<br><br>
-25-<br>
mobile stations is transmitted using a fixed power<br>
PFIX.<br>
By the way, data transmitted from a<br>
transmitter is coded, modulated, mapped to radio<br>
resources, converted to a transmission symbol (OFDM<br>
symbol, for example), and transmitted. Coding is<br>
performed for providing error correction capability.<br>
Convolution coding or turbo coding or the like may<br>
be performed. The unit for performing coding may be<br>
a chunk, or data of a plurality of chunks may be<br>
coded as a whole. As for the present embodiment, it<br>
is desirable that coding is performed in units of<br>
data for which same transmission power control is<br>
performed. For example, when the transmission power<br>
control is performed for each user, it is desirable<br>
that coding is also performed for each user. When<br>
transmission power control is performed for three<br>
users as a whole, it is desirable that coding is<br>
performed for three users as a whole.<br>
For example, in a situation described with<br>
reference to Fig.14, assuming that resources of<br>
three users of users #1, #2 and #3 are assigned as<br>
shown in Fig.15(1). One chunk is assigned to the<br>
user #1, three chunks are assigned to the user #2,<br>
and four chunks are assigned to the user #3. Coding<br>
is performed for each user, and each of three ranges<br>
of data each enclosed with a thick line is coded<br>
separately. As to these pieces of data, three users<br>
are controlled by "CQI based downlink TPC"<br>
separately, and transmission powers are represented<br>
as Pi, P2 and P3 respectively. Fig. 15(2) also shows<br>
a situation in which coding and power control are<br>
performed for each user, but assignment of chunk is<br>
different. In the example shown in Fig.15(3), data<br>
of three users are coded as a whole, and a control<br>
method (CQI based downlink TPC) for one of the users<br>
is applied to other users. The transmission power<br><br>
-26-<br>
is indicated as Pα (α=l,2 or 3), and is transmission<br>
power for a user that reports the worst CQI. By the<br>
way, the user number and the unit for bringing<br>
together in coding are merely examples, and various<br>
numbers may be adopted. Generally, the larger the<br>
unit for coding is, the higher error correction<br>
ability becomes, but calculation load tends to<br>
increase. Therefore, in the example shown in<br>
Fig.15(1), calculation load for coding and decoding<br>
is small, and transmission power is optimally<br>
controlled without excess or deficiency. On the<br>
other hand, in the example shown in Fig.15(3),<br>
although calculation load for coding and decoding<br>
becomes large, large error correction ability can be<br>
expected, and in addition, since power becomes<br>
excessive for two users of the three users,<br>
improvement of data can be expected. From the<br>
viewpoint for simplifying processes and<br>
strengthening improvement of quality, it is<br>
desirable to adopt same power control to data<br>
included in one unit of coding like the present<br>
embodiment.<br>

average propagation loss between the mobile station<br>
and the base station; and<br>
transmits the uplink pilot channel using<br>
the derived transmission power.<br>
17.	The mobile station as claimed in claim<br>
15, wherein the mobile station transmits both or one<br>
of a first pilot channel in which a symbol mapping<br>
pattern is constant and a second pilot channel in<br>
which a symbol mapping pattern is variable.<br>
18.	A power control method, wherein:<br>
a base station derives a transmission<br>
power by which a mobile station needs to change<br>
based on receive quality of an uplink pilot channel,<br>
reports the derived transmission power to<br>
the mobile station, and<br><br>
-32-<br>
the mobile station changes its<br>
transmission power according to the reported<br>
information to transmit a control channel.<br><br>
A base station includes: means that<br>
derives a transmission power of a mobile station<br>
based on receive quality of an uplink pilot channel;<br>
means that reports the derived transmission power to<br>
the mobile station; and means that receives a<br>
control channel transmitted by the mobile station<br>
according to the reported information. Accordingly,<br>
irrespective of transmission power history over a<br>
past continuous time, the mobile station receives an<br>
instruction on the transmission power from the base<br>
station each time when transmitting a packet so as<br>
to be able to adjust the transmission power.<br></td>
