TRANSMISSION POWER CONTROL METHOD, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
5       This application is based upon and claims the benef it of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. P2005-274648, filed on August 24, 2005; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
10	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission power control method and a mobile communication system for controlling a transmission power of a transmission 15  acknowledgement channel for uplink user data, which is<br>
transmitted from a cell controlled by a radio base station to a mobile station.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
20 In a conventional mobile communication system, when setting a Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) between a mobile station UE and a radio base station Node B, a radio network controller RNC is configured to determine a transmission rate of uplink user data, in consideration of hardware resources for<br>
25 receiving of the radio base station Node B (hereinafter, hardware resource), a radio resource in an uplink (an interference volume in an uplink) , a transmission power of the mobile station UE, a transmission processing performance of the mobile station UE, a transmission rate required for an upper<br><br>
application, or the like, and to notify the determined transmission rate of the uplink user data by a message of a layer-3 (Radio Resource Control Layer) to both of the mobile station UE and the radio base station Node B.<br>
Here, the radio network controller RNC is provided at an upper level of the radio base station Node B, and is an apparatus configured to control the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE.<br>
In general, data communications often cause burst traffic compared with voice communications or TV communications. Therefore, it is preferable that a transmission rate of a channel used for the data communications is changed fast.<br>
However, as shown in FIG, l, the radio network controller RNC integrally controls a plurality of radio base stations Node B in general. Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that it is difficult to perform fast control for changing of the transmission rate of uplink user data (for example, per approximately 1 through 100 ms), due to the increase of processing load and processing delay in the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In addition, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been also a problem that costs for implementing an apparatus and for operating a network are substantially increased even if the fast control for changing of the transmission rate of the uplink user data can be performed.<br>
Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, control for changing of the transmission rate of the<br><br>
uplink user data is generally performed on the order from a few hundred ms to a few seconds.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional mobile communication system, when burst data transmission is performed as shown in FIG. 2A, the data are transmitted by accepting low-speed, high-delay, and low-transmission efficiency as shown in FIG. 2B, or, as shown in FIG. 2C, by reserving radio resources for high-speed communications to accept that radio bandwidth resources in an unoccupied state and hardware resources in the radio base station Node B are wasted.<br>
It should be noted that both of the above-described radio bandwidth resources and hardware resources are applied to the vertical radio resources in FIGS- 2B and 2C.<br>
Therefore, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) , which are international standardization organizations of the third generation mobile communication system, have discussed a method for controlling radio resources at high speed in a layer-1 and a media access control (MAC) sub-layer (a layer-2) between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, so as to utilize the uplink radio resources effectively. Such discussions or discussed functions will be hereinafter referred to as "Enhanced Uplink (EUL)".<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the mobile communication system, to which the "Enhanced Uplink" is applied, is explained.<br>
As shown in an example of FIG- 3, in the mobile communication system, a cell, which is controlled by a radio base station Node B, is configured to transmit an "Enhanced HARQ Acknowledgement Indicator Channel  (E-HICH)" which is a<br><br>
transniission acknowledge channel, in order to perform a retransmission control of the uplink user data, i,e., "Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)"â€¢<br>
In other words, in the above mobile communication system, the cell, which is controlled by the radio base station Node B, is configured to perform an error detection check {^Cyclic Redundancy Check" CRC) of the uplink user data transmitted via an "Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)", and to notify an "ACK" or a "NACK" to the mobile station UE using the E-HICH, so as to perform the retransmission control of the uplink user data of the mobile station UE.<br>
To be more specific, as shown in FIG.3, the mobile station UE, which has transmitted an E-DPDCH #1 to a cell #2, is configured to transmit the subsequent E-DPDCH to the cell #2, upon receiving of an E-HICH #1 (ACK) from the cell #2.<br>
On the other hand, the mobile station UE is configured to retransmit the E-DPDCH #1 to the cell #2, upon receiving of the E-HICH (NACK) from the cell #2.<br>
Further, in the above mobile communication system, a closed loop transmission power control using a "Transmit Power Control (TPC) command" is known, as an example of the transmission power control method for a. downlink dedicated physical channel (herein after, DPCH) transmitted from the radio base station Node B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, the closed loop transmission power control using the TPC command is described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, the mobile station UE, which has received a downlink DPCH transmitted from the cell #2, is configured to determine the increase/decrease of a transmission<br><br>
power of the downlink DPCH in the cell #2 controlled by the radio base station Node B, based on the transmission power of the received downlink DPCH. Then, the mobile station UE is configured to transmit the determined result of the increase/decrease of the transmission power of the downlink DPCH to the cell #2, using the TPC command (for example, UP command/Down Command).<br>
In addition, the cell #2 is configured to control the transmission power of the downlink DPCH to be transmitted to the mobile station UE, using the TPC command transmitted from the mobile station UE.<br>
In addition, in the above mobile communication system, the cell #2 is configured to determine the transmission power of the E-HICH, based on the transmission power of the downlink DPCH and a predetermined offset (an E-HICH offset).<br>
As described above, in the mobile communication system, the reception power of the downlink DPCH in the mobile station UE will be improved by the transmission power control using the TPC command, and therefore, the reception power of the E-HICH, which depends on the downlink DPCH, will be also improved.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 4B, the transmission power control using the TPC command in the mobile communication system in which soft-handover (SHO) is performed is described.<br>
In the above mobile communication system, as shown in FIG-4B, when the mobile station UE is performing the SHO by establishing radio links with the cell #3 as well as the cell #4, and when the mobile station UE receives the same DPCHs #1 transmitted from the cell #3 and the cell #4, the mobile station UE is configured to combine the DPCH #1 received from the cell<br><br>
#3 and the DPCH#l received from the cell #4, so as to determine the increase/decrease of the transmission power of the DPCH #1 in both of the cell #3 and the cell #4, based on the reception power of the combined DPCH #1.<br>
Then, the mobile station UE is configured to transmit the determined result of the increase/decrease of the transmission power of the DPCH #1 to the both of the cell #3 and the cell #4, using the TPC command.<br>
In addition, in the above mobile communication system, the transmission power of the E-HICH #1 transmitted from the cell #3 is configured to be determined, based on the transmission power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #3 and the predetermined offset (the E-HICH offset).<br>
in addition, the transmission power of the E-HICH #2 transmitted from the cell #4 is configured to be determined, based on the transmission power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #4 and the predetermined offset (the E-HICH offset) ,<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 4B, in the above mobile communication system, if the mobile station UE is performing the SHO by establishing the radio links with the cell #3 as well as the cell #4, and if the reception power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #3 is good enough, even when the reception power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #4 is insufficient, the reception power of the combined DPCH #1 will be sufficient for the mobile station UE.<br>
Therefore, in the above mobile communication system, the mobile station UE can receive the DPCH #1, if the reception power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #3 is good enough, even when the reception power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the<br><br>
cell #4 is insufficient.<br>
Accordingly, in such a condition, the transmission power of the DPCH #1 does not have to be increased, and the mobile station UE is configured not to transmit the TPC command (for example, UP command) for increasing the transmission power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #4.<br>
However, in the above condition, as shown in FIG. 5, the transmission power of the E-HICH #2 transmitted from the cell #4 is depending on the transmission power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #4, so that the reception power of the E-HICH #2 will be insufficient, when the reception power of the DPCH #1 transmitted from the cell #4 is insufficient in the mobile station UE,<br>
Therefore, in the above mobile communication system, when the mobile station UE is performing the SHO by establishing the radio links with the cell #3 as well as the cell #4, the mobile station UE can receive the E-HICH #1 transmitted from the cell #3, however the mobile station UE cannot receive the E-HICH #2 transmitted from the cell #4.<br>
Accordingly, in the case as shown in FIG. 5, there has been a problem that the mobile station UE can receive the E-HICH #1 (NACK) and the mobile station UE can not receive the E-HICH #2 (ACK), even when the cell #3 transmits the E-HICH #1 (NACK) in response to the E-DPDCH #1 transmitted from the mobile station UE, and the cell #4 transmits the E-HICH #2 (ACK) in response to the E-DPDCH #1 transmitted from the mobile station UE.<br>
Therefore, in such a case, the mobile station UE does not transmit the subsequent uplink user data, but the mobile station<br><br>
UE retransmits the E-DPDCH #1 to the cell #4 unnecessarily.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(Configuration of Mobile Communication System According to First Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
Referring to FIGs. 6 to 17, a configuration of a mobile communication system according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
It should be noted that, the mobile communication system according to this embodiment is designed in order to increase a communication performance such as a communication capacity, a communication quality and the like. Further, the mobile communication system according to this embodiment can be   applied to WW-CDMAW and "CDMA2 000" of the third generation mobile communication system.<br>
An example of general configuration of a mobile station UE according to this embodiment is shown in FIG. 6.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the mobile station UE is provided with<br><br>
a bus interface 11, a call processing control section 12, a baseband signal processing section 13, a transmitter-receiver section 14, and a transmission-reception antenna 15- In addition/ the mobile station UE can be configured to include an amplifier section (not shown in FIG. 4).<br>
However, these functions do not have to be independently present as hardware. That is, these functions can be partly or entirely integrated, or can be configured through a process of software.<br>
In FIG. 7, a functional block of the baseband signal processing section 13 is shown.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the baseband signal processing section 13 is provided with an upper layer functional section 131, a RLC functional section 132, a MAC-d functional section 133, a MAC-e functional section 134, and a layer-1 functional section 135.<br>
The RLC functional section 132 is configured to work as a RLC sublayer. The layer-1 functional section 135 is configured to work as a layer-1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the RLC functional section 132 is configured to divide an application data (RLC SDU), which is received from the upper layer functional section 131, into PDUs of a predetermined PDU size. Then, the RLC functional section 132 is configured to generate RLC PDUs by adding a RLC header used for a sequence control processing, retransmission processing, and the like, so as to pass the RLC PDUs to the MAC-d functional section 133.<br>
Here, a pipeline works as a bridge between the RLC functional section 132 and the MAC-d functional section 133 is<br><br>
a "logical channel". The logical channel is classified based on the contents of data to be transmitted/received, and when a communication is performed, it is possible to establish a plurality of logical channels in one connection. In other words, when the communication is performed, it is possible to transmit/receive a plurality of data with different contents (for example, control data and user data, or the like) logically in parallel.<br>
The MAC-d functional section 133 is configured to multiplex the logical channels, and to add a MAC-d header associated with the multiplex of the logical channels, so as to generate a MAC-d PDU. A plurality of MAC-d PDUs are^ transferred from the MAC-d functional section 133 to the MAC-e functional section 134 as MAC-d flow.<br>
The MAC-e functional section 134 is configured to assemble a plurality of MAC-d PDUs which are received from the MAC-d functional section 133 as MAC-d flow, and to add a MAC-e header to the assembled MAC-d PDU, so as to generate a transport block. Then, the MAC-e functional section 134 is configured to pass the generated transport block to the layer-1 functional section 135 through a transport channel.<br>
In addition, the MAC-e functional section 134 is configured to work as a lower layer of the MAC-d functional section 133, and to implement the retransmission control function according to Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) and the transmission rate control function.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 9, the MAC-e functional section 134 is provided with a multiplex section 134a, an E-TFC selecting section 134b, and an HARQ processing section 134c.<br><br>
The multiplex section 134a is configured to perform a multiplex processing to the uplink user data, which is received from the MAC-d functional section 133 as MAC-d flow, based on a "Enhanced - Transport Format Indicator (E-TFI) " notified from   the E-TFC selecting section 134b, so as to generate uplink user data (a Transport Block) to be transmitted via a transport channel (E-DCH). Then, the multiplex section 134a is configured to transmit the generated uplink user data (Transport Block) to the HARQ processing section 134c.<br>
Hereinafter, the uplink user data received as MAC-d flow is indicated as the "uplink user data (MAC-d flow)", and the uplink user data to be transmitted via the transport channel (E-DCH) is indicated as the "uplink user data (E-DCH)".<br>
The E-TFI is an identifier of a transport format, which is a format for providing the transport block on the transport channel (E-DCH) per TTI, and the E-TFI is added to the MAC-e header.<br>
The multiplex section 134a is configured to determine a transmission data block size to be applied for the uplink user data based on the E-TFI notified from the E-TPC selecting section 134b, and to notify the determined transmission data block size to the HARQ processing section 134c.<br>
In addition, when the multiplex section 134a receives the uplink user data from the MAC-d functional section 133 as MAC-d flow, the multiplex section 134a is configured to notify, to the E-TFC selecting section 134b, E-TFC selecting information for selecting a transport format for the received uplink user data.<br>
Here, the E-TFC selecting information includes data size<br><br>
and priority class of the uplink user data, or the like.<br>
The HARQ processing section 134c is configured to perform the retransmission control processing for the wuplink user data (E-DCH)" according to the "N channel stop and wait (N-SAW) protocol" , based on ACK/NACK for the uplink user data notified from the layer-1 functional section 135. An example for operations of the M channel stop and wait protocol" is shown in FIG. 10.<br>
In addition, the HARQ processing section 134c is configured to transmit, to the layer-1 functional section 13 5, the "uplink user data (E-DCH)" received from the multiplex section 134a, and HARQ information (for example, a number for retransmission, and the like) used for the HARQ processing.<br>
The E-TFC selecting section 134b is configured to determine the transmission rate of the uplink user data by selecting the transport format (E-TF) to be applied to the "uplink user data (E-DCH)".<br>
Specifically, the E-TFC selecting section 134b is configured to determine whether the transmission of the uplink user data should be performed or stopped, based on scheduling information, the amount of data in MAC-d PDU, the condition of hardware resource of the radio base station Node B, and the like.<br>
The scheduling information (such as absolute transmission rate and a relative transmission rate of the uplink user data) is received from the radio base station Node B, the amount of data in MAC-d PDU (such as data size of the uplink user data) is passed from the MAC-d functional section 133, and the condition of hardware resource of the radio base station Node B is controlled in the MAC-e functional section 134.<br><br>
Then, the E-TFC selection section 134b is configured to select the transport format (E-TF) to be applied to transmission of the uplink user data, and to notify the E-TFI for identifying the selected transport format to the layer-1 functional section 135 and the multiplex section 134a.<br>
For example, the E-TFC selecting section 134b is configured to store the transmission rate of uplink user data in association with the transport format, to update the transmission rate of uplink user data based on the scheduling information from the layer-1 functional section 135, and to notify, to the layer-1 functional section 135 and the multiplex section 134a, the E-TFI for identifying the transport format which is associated with the updated transmission rate of uplink user data.<br>

(Operations of Mobile Communication System According to First<br>
Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
Referring to FlGs. is and 19, operations of the mobile<br>
communication system according to this embodiment will be<br>
described-<br>
Specifically,  the  operations  of  controlling  a<br>
transmission power of a transmission acknowledgement channel<br>
(E-HICH) for uplink user data in the mobile communication system<br>
according to this embodiment will be described-Here, in this embodiment, examples where a radio base<br>
station Node B is configured to control one or a plurality of<br><br>
cells, the cells include the functions of the radio base station Node B will be described.<br>
As a first example, operation of controlling a transmission power of an E-HICH by a cell #10, when a mobile station UE is shifting from the Non-SHO state, where the radio link with only the cell #10 in established, to the SHO state, where the radio links with the cell #10 as well as a cell #2 0 are established, will be described.<br>
In this embodiment, it can be configured that both of cell #10 and cell #20 are controlled by a same single radio base station Node B, or the each of cell #10 and cell #20 is controlled by different radio base stations Node B,<br>
As shown in FIG. IS, in step S1001, the mobile station UE is establishing a data connection for transmitting uplink user data with the radio network controller RNC via the cell<br>
#10.<br>
In this case, the cell #10 is configured to determine the transmission power of the E-HICH, based on the transmission power of the DPCH and the first E-HICH offset.<br>
To be more specific, the cell #10 is configured to multiply or add the first E-HICH offset which is included in the E-HICH offset information transmitted from the radio network controller RNC in advance, to the DPCH to which the closed loop transmission power control is performed, so as to determine the transmission power of the E-HICH.<br>
In step S1002, when the reception power of the common pilot signal from the cell #20 become more than or equal to the predetermined value, the mobile station HE transmits a measurement report to the radio'network controller RNC,<br><br>
In step S10Q3, the radio network controller RNC requests the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #20 to establish synchronization of radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20, based on the transmitted measurement report.<br>
To be more specific, the radio network controller RNC transmits a SHO setting request to the radio base station Node #2 which controls the cell #20, so as to request to establish synchronization of the radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20.<br>
The SHO setting request includes a channelization code for identifying the channel configuration in the radio link, and a scrambling code for identifying the mobile station UE.<br>
In step S1004, the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #20 establishes the synchronization of the radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20.<br>
To be more specific, in the radio link for uplink, the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #20 detects the channel transmitted by the mobile station UE using the channelization code and the scrambling code received from the radio network controller KNC, so as to establish the synchronization of the radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20.<br>
When the synchronization of the radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20 is established, the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #2 0 transmits a SHO setting response to the radio network controller RNC. In addition, in the downlink, the cell #20 starts the<br><br>
transmission of the DPCH and the like to the mobile station HE.<br>
In step S1005, the radio network controller RNC requests<br>
the mobile station UE to establish synchronization of radio<br>
links for downlink between the cell #20 and the mobile station<br>
To be more specific, the radio network controller RNC transmits a SHO setting request to the mobile station UE, so as to request to establish the synchronization of radio links or downlink between the cell #20 and the mobile station UE.<br>
Here, the SHO setting request includes a channelization code for identifying the channel configuration in the radio link for downlink, and a scrambling code for identifying the cell #20.<br>
In step S1006, the mobile station UE establishes the synchronization of radio links for downlink between the cell #2 0 and the mobile station UE.<br>
To be more specific, in the radio link for downlink, the mobile station UE detects the channel transmitted from the cell #20 using the channelization code and the scrambling code received from the radio network controller RNC, so as to establish the synchronization of the radio links for downlink between the cell #20 and the mobile station UE.<br>
When the synchronization of the radio links for downlink between the cell #20 and the mobile station UE is established, the mobile station UE transmits a SHO setting response to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step S1007, the radio network controller RNC transmits the E-HICH offset information including the second E-HICH offset, to the radio base station Node B #1 which controls the<br><br>
cell #10 and the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #2 0.<br>
The E-HICH offset information may be transmitted to the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #20, by the SHO setting request.<br>
In step S1008, the cell #10 and the cell #20 determine the transmission power of the E-HICH, based on the second E-HICH offset which is included in the E-HICH offset information transmitted from the radio network controller KNC.<br>
Here/ the second E-HICH offset transmitted from the radio network controller RNC is set to be greater than the first E-HICH offset.<br>
Accordingly, when the mobile station UE, i.e., the destination of the E-HICH, is performing the SHO, the cell #10 sets the E-HICH off set greater, and to increase the transmission power of the E-HICH, so as to ensure the transmission of the E-HICH to the mobile station UE which is performing the SHO.<br>
As a second example, operation of controlling the transmission power of the E-HICH by the cell #10, when the mobile station UE is shifting from the SHO state, where the radio links with the cell #10 as well as a cell #20 are established, to the Non-SHO state, where the radio link with only the cell #10 is established, will be described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, in step S2001, when the reception power of the common pilot signal from the cell #20 become less than the predetermined value, the mobile station UE transmits a measurement report to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step S2002, the radio network controller RNC requests the radio base station Node B #2 which controls the cell #20<br><br>
to release the radio links for uplink between the mobile station UE and the cell #20, based on the transmitted measurement report.<br>
In addition, the radio network controller RUC transmits a SHO release request to the mobile station UE, so as to release the radio link for downlink between the cell #20 and the mobile station UE.<br>
In step S2003, the radio network controller RNC transmits the E-HICH offset information including the first E-HICH offset to the radio base station Node B #1.<br>
In step S2004, the cell #10, which has received the E-HICH offset information, determines the transmission power of the E-HICH, based on the first E-HICH offset included in the B-HICH offset information and the transmission power of the downlink DPCH.<br>
Accordingly/ when the mobile station UE, i.e., the destination of the E-HICH, is not performing the SHO, the cell #10 is configured to minimize the E-HICH offset in the Non-SHO state appropriately, and to adjust the transmission power of the E-HICH, so as to use the radio network capacity effectively.<br>
In the mobile communication system according to this embodiment, the example that the radio network controller RNC transmits the E-HICH offset information including the second E-HICH offset, when the mobile station UE is performing the SHO, is shown.<br>
However, in the present invention, the radio network controller RNC can be configured to transmit the E-HICH offset information including the second E-HICH offset based on the predetermined notification from the mobile station UE and the<br><br>
cell (for example, a predetermined measurement report from the mobile station UE, and the like).<br>
(Effects of Mobile Communication System according to First embodiment of the Present invention)<br>
According to the transmission power control method and the mobile communication system of the present invention, it is possible to transmit the E-HICH to the mobile station UE, even when the mobile station UE is performing the SHO.<br>
In other words, according to the transmission power control method and the mobile communication system of the present invention, when the mobile station UE is performing the SHO, the cell or the radio base station Node B which controls the cell can set the E-HICH offset greater, and increase the transmission power of the E-HICH greater. Therefore, it is possible to ensure the transmission of the E-HICH to the mobile station UE.<br>
