				<td>The present invention relates to a sample warper and a warping method<br>
where feed of a conveyor belt is changed according to a count (yarn thickness) of<br>
a yarn to be warped so that there can be canceled surface undulation of finished<br>
winding of the yarn which has been wound on a warper drum to achieve flat<br>
finishing.<br>
As a conventional sample warper, there has been known a structure,<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 1529104. The sample warper comprises: a<br>
warper drum ; a single yarn introduction means rotatably mounted on one side<br>
surface of the warper drum for winding a yarn on the warper drum ; a plurality of<br>
yarn selection guides associated with the yarn introduction means and mounted<br>
on an end of a base supporting the warper drum for moving angularly movable to<br>
project to a yarn exchanging position and retract to a standby position during yarn<br>
changing; a fixed creel for supporting a plurality of bobbins which are associated<br>
with the plural yarn selection guidjes and on which the same kind or different<br>
kinds of yarns are to be wound, thereby passing the yarns between the yarn<br>
introduction means and the yarn selection guides so that the yarns are<br>
automatically changed and successively wound neatly on the warper drum<br>
according to preset pattern data (yarn order).<br>
In the sample warper, the yarn selection guides the<br>
yarns so that the individual yarns of the fixed creel can be<br>
successively wound on the Warper drum in a fully controlled manner. A<br>
plurality of conveyor belts are movably mounted on a circumferential surface of<br>
the warper drum. The feed rate of the conveyor belt is controlled by a<br>
conveyor belt feed means, that is, a conveyor belt feed motor later described.<br>
A plurality of parallel shedding members (or parallel shedding bars)<br>
longitudinally extend alongside of the warper drum.<br>
This known sample warper has a hollow shaft. Driving and<br>
driven shafts project centrally from opposite ends of the hollow shaft. A first<br>
small gear fixed to a pulley and a pulley are loosely mounted on the driving<br>
shaft, while a second small gear, to which a yarn introduction means is fixed,<br>
is loosely mounted on the driven shaft at the distal end. While the illustrated<br>
example shows only one yarn introduction means, two or more yarn<br>
introduction means must be disposed for a plural-winding system.<br>
The first and second small gears are associated with each other<br>
through third small gears disposed at opposite ends of an associating shaft<br>
extending through the hollow shaft. These third small gears are meshed with<br>
the corresponding first and second small gears. The hollow shaft is<br>
cantilevered at the driving shaft, and a warper drum is loosely mounted on the<br>
hollow shaft on the driven shaft side.<br>
The warper drum is formed of drum frames having an outer<br>
periphery of like shape having alternately an arcuate portion and a straight<br>
portion; a pair of rollers disppsed one on the arcuate portion of each of the<br>
drum frames; and horizontal beams carrying the rollers around which<br>
conveyor belts are wound. The conveyor belts are moved along a plane<br>
formed by the horizontal beams.<br>
The conveyor belts are simultaneously driven to a common<br>
amount of fine movement by a drive member, threadedly engaged with<br>
interior screw shafts of planetary gears concurrently rotated by meshing with<br>
a sun gear suitably driven from the exterior. A feed rate of the conveyor belt<br>
may be controlled by a control unit controlling a conveyor belt moving motor<br>
later described, that is, a conveyor belt feed means. The distal end of the<br>
yarn introduction means is bent inwardly to provide a yarn introducing<br>
member which is disposed adjacent to the front end of the outer periphery of<br>
the warper drum.<br>
A fixed creel supports a plurality of bobbins around which different<br>
kinds (different colors or different twists) of yarns are woupd ; a guide plate<br>
guides yarns drawn out fronji the bobbins, a tension regulator regulates the<br>
tension of the yarns. A dropper ring, a guide rod for the yarns, and a yarn<br>
fastener having a permanent magnet mounted to a base for pressing and<br>
setting the yarns are provided.<br>
A main motor is operated by an inverter motor for enabling, during<br>
operation of the warper, acceleration and deceleration, buffer start/stop,<br>
jogging operation and an increased winding speed.<br>
A main speed change pulley is provided. A V belt is wound on<br>
and between the main speed change pulley and an auxiliary speed change<br>
pulley. A counter pulley is coaxial with the auxiliary speed change pulley,<br>
and a brake actuating pinion reciprocatingly moves a rack to bring the rack<br>
into and out of engagement with a brake hole in a brake drum, thus<br>
controlling the warper drum as desired. A belt extends between the pulleys<br>
on the driving shaft. A conveyor belt moving motor (AC servo motor) is<br>
provided. A shift lever, a sprocket-wheel, a chain, a chain wheel for driving<br>
the sun gear, V belts, a front cover, a front guide rod and a brake drum are<br>
also provided. There are sensors for detecting the passing of the slit of the<br>
slitted plate.<br>
A movement/stopping change-over level is provided for the<br>
conveyor belts. A locking leVer is provided for locking the warper drum. A<br>
shedding bar adjusting lever, a shedding bar locking handle, a program<br>
setting unit, and a controller! are provided. A yarn tensioning unit is located<br>
centrally on the straight part of the warper drum. A rewinder is also provided.<br>
A controller controls the sample warper and may control various<br>
apparatus connected thereto in accordance with a program set by a program<br>
setting unit. The basic structure and operation of the sample warper are well<br>
known as by the above-mentioned Japanese Patent, so their detailed<br>
description is omitted here. As the conveyor belt, needless to say, there may<br>
be used an endless conveyor belt mechanism as disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-open Publication No.11-315439.<br>
As disclosed in the above Japanese Patent, feed of the conveyor<br>
belt in the sample warper of this kind is controlled by a conveyor belt feed<br>
control unit on the basis of the feed rate of the conveyor belt, namely, a feed<br>
pitch per revolution of the yarn introduction means calculated according to<br>
data input of warping width, the number of warping yarns, and warping length<br>
(the number of warping windings).<br>
In the above-mentioned sample warper, however, the feed rate of<br>
the conveyor belt, or the feed pitch per revolution of the yarn introduction<br>
means is calculated according to the following equation (1) on the basis of the<br>
warping width, the total number of yarns to be warped and the warping length<br>
(the number of warping windings), so that it becomes the same pitch<br>
irrespective of a count (yarn thickness).<br>
Equation (1): Warping width = feed pitch x the number of warping windings x<br>
the total number of yarns to be warped : Q( warping density) = P(feed pitch) x<br>
the number of warping windings; Warping density (Q) = warping width + the<br>
total number of yarns to be warped : (P) = warping density (Q) + the number<br>
of warping windings<br>
For this reason, When first yarns and second yarns of the same<br>
count (the same thickness) are used to perform one winding warping, the<br>
surface contour of the wound yarns is flat. Also, even when warping of yarns<br>
of the same count is performed, for example, under the same condition of<br>
warping density (Q) = yarn diameter (d) as above and with warping length of<br>
five windings (the warping condition), the surface contour of the wound yams<br>
is flat.<br>
However, when first yarns (thick yarns) and the second yarns<br>
(thin yarns) different in the count (yarn thickness) from each other are used to<br>
perform one winding warping under the condition of warping density Q = yarn<br>
diameter of the yarns, for example, the wound yarn state of the thick yarn<br>
portion, namely the portion of the first yarns is thick, while the<br>
wound yarns state of the thin yarn portion, namely the portion of the second<br>
yarns is thin, so that the surface contour of the wound yarns is undulated.<br>
Also, when both the yarns are warped with a warping length of<br>
five windings (under the warpjng condition), the wound yarn state of the thick<br>
yarn portion, namely the portion of the first yarns is further thick, while the<br>
wound yarn state of the thin yarn portion, namely, the portion of the second<br>
yarns is much thinner than the thickness of the portion of the first yarns, so<br>
that the surface contour of the wound yarns becomes largely undulated .<br>
In case the surface contour of the yarns wound on a warper drum<br>
becomes undulated, the circumferential lengths of the respective yarn layers<br>
differ from one another comparing the thick yarn portion with the thin yarn<br>
portion. As a result, on rewinding the yarns wound on the warper drum on a<br>
beam of a rewinder, the difference in circumferential lengths of the yarns<br>
leads to a rewinding tension difference, and rewinding the yarn from the<br>
warper drum with a large diameter to the beam with a small diameter, the<br>
difference in undulation of the surface contour of the wound yarn results in a<br>
further large difference in surface undulation of the yarns rewound on the<br>
beam, which causes big troubles in a next weaving step.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the foregoing drawbacks of the prior art in view, it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a sample warper and a warping<br>
method where data regarding yarn.<br>
diameters of counts are preliminarily input and stored, counts of warping<br>
yarns as well as pattern data for warping are input, a conveyor belt feed pitch<br>
per revolution of a yarn introduction means is calculated with a warping width,<br>
the total number of yarns to the warped, and a warping length (the number of<br>
warping windings), and the conveyor belt feed pitch per revolution of the yarn<br>
introduction means is controlled according to the counts (yarn thicknesses or<br>
yarn diameters) so that a surface of the yarns wound on a warper drum is<br>
finished in a flat state without undulation irrespective of the counts, thereby<br>
solving the above troubles in the next weaving step.<br>
To attain the foregoing object, the present invention provides a<br>
sample warper comprising : a warper drum ; a conveyor belt movable on the<br>
warper drum ; means for moving the conveyor belt at a feed rate ; at least<br>
one means for introducing yarns and exchanging yarns for winding the yarns<br>
on the conveyor belt moving on the warper drum at the feed rate to perform<br>
design warping ; means for controlling the feed rate of the conveyor belt<br>
wherein when warping yarns of different counts (different thicknesses), the<br>
feed rate of the conveyor belt is controlled according to diameters<br>
(thicknesses) of the respective yarns so that a surface contour of the yarns<br>
wound on the warper drum is finished in a flat state irrespective of the yarn<br>
diameters of the different counts.<br>
The present invention also provides a warping method comprising<br>
the steps of: catching yarns by a least one yarn introduction means and<br>
exchanging the yarns ; winding the yarns on a conveyor belt moving on a<br>
warper drum at a feed rate to perform design<br>
warping ; and when warping yarns of different counts (different thicknesses),<br>
controlling a feed rate of the conveyor belt according to diameters (thicknesses)<br>
of the respective yarns so that a surface contour of the yarns wound on the<br>
warper drum is finished in a flat stste irrespective of the yarn diameters of the<br>
different counts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the warping method, movement of the<br>
conveyor belt is controlled such that when warping a thick yarn of a large<br>
diameter, the conveyor belt is moved with an increased feed rate, and when<br>
warping a thin yarn of a small diameter, the conveyor belt is moved with a<br>
decreased feed rate, so that the surface of yarns wound on the warper drum can<br>
be finished in a flat state without undulation irrespective of the counts.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF, PRIOR ART<br>
As a conventional sample warper (W), there has been known a<br>
structure shown in Figs. 8 to 10, disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 1529104.<br>
The sample warper (W) of Fig. 8 comprises : a warper drum (A) ; a single<br>
yarn introduction means 6, rotatably mounted on one side surface of the<br>
warper drum (A) for winding a yarn on the warper drum (A); a plurality of yarn<br>
selection guides 27 associated with the yarn introduction means 6 and<br>
mounted on an end of a base (Y) supporting the warper drum (A) for moving<br>
angularly movable to project to a yarn exchanging position and retract to a<br>
standby position during yarn changing ; a fixed creel (B) for supporting a<br>
plurality of bobbins (N) which are associated with the plural yarn selection<br>
guides 27 and on which the same kind or different kinds of yarns 22 are to be<br>
wound, thereby passing the yarns 22 between the yarn introduction means 6<br>
and the yarn selection guides 27 so that the yarns are automatically changed<br>
and successively wound neatly on the warper drum (A) according to preset<br>
pattern data (yarn order).<br>
In the sample wajrper (W), the plural yarn selection guides 27<br>
receive the plural yarns 22, respectively, so that the individual yarns 22 of the<br>
fixed creel (B) can be successively wound on the warper drum (W) in a fully<br>
controlled manner. Reference numeral 17 designates a plurality of conveyor<br>
belts are movably mounted on a circumferential surface of the warper drum<br>
(A). /The feed rate of the conveyor belt 17 is controlled by a conveyor belt<br>
feed means, that is, a conveyor belt feed motor later described. A plurality of<br>
parallel shedding members (or parallel shedding bars 38a to 38g)<br>
longitudinally extend alongside; of the warper drum (A).<br>
This known sample warper (W) has a hollow shaft 1 (Fig.9).<br>
Driving and driven shafts 2, 3 project centrally from opposite ends of the<br>
hollow shaft 1. A first small gear 5 fixed to a pulley 4 and a pulley 99 are<br>
loosely mounted on the driving shaft 2, while a second small gear 7, to<br>
which a yarn introduction means 6 is fixed, is loosely mounted on the driven<br>
shaft 3 at the distal end. While the illustrated example shows only one yarn<br>
introduction means 6, two or more yarn introduction means 6 must be<br>
disposed for a plural-winding system.<br>
The first and second small gears 5, 7 are associated with each<br>
other through third small gears 9, 10 disposed at opposite ends of an<br>
associating shaft 8 extending through the hollow shaft 1. These third small<br>
gears 9, 10 are meshed with the corresponding first and second small gears<br>
5, 7. The hollow shaft 1 is cantilevered at the driving shaft 2, and a warper<br>
drum (A) is loosely mounted on the hollow shaft 1 on the driven shaft 3 side.<br>

straight portion ; a pair of rollers 15 disposed one on the arcuate portion of<br>
each of the drum frames 13, 14-; and horizontal beams 16 carrying the rollers<br>
15 around which conveyor belts 17 are wound. The conveyor belts 17 are<br>
moved along a plane formed by the horizontal beams 16.<br>
The conveyor belts 17 are simultaneously driven to a common<br>
amount of fine movement byj a drive member 21, threadedly engaged with<br>
interior screw shafts 20 of planetary gears 19 concurrently rotated by meshing<br>
with a sun gear 18 suitably driven from the exterior. A feed rate of the<br>
conveyor belt 17 may be controlled by a control unit controlling a conveyor<br>
belt moving motor 51 later described, that is, a conveyor belt feed means.<br>
The distal end of the yarn introduction means 6 is bent inwardly to provide a<br>
yarn introducing member 61 which is disposed adjacent to the front end of the<br>
outer periphery of the warper drum (A).<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, (B) designates a fixed creel supports a<br>
plurality of bobbins around which different kinds (different colors or different<br>
twists) of yarns 22 are wound ; 24, a guide plate guides yarns 22 drawn out<br>
from the bobbins ; 25, a tension regulator regulates the tension of the yarns<br>
22 ; 26, a dropper ring ; 30, a guide rod for the yarns 22; and (E), a yarn<br>
fastener having a permanent magnet mounted to a base (Y) for pressing and<br>
setting the yarns.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 9 reference numeral 46 designates a main<br>
motor is operated by an inverter motor for enabling, during operation of the<br>
warper, acceleration and deceleration, buffer start/stop, jogging operation and<br>
an increased winding speed.<br>
Further in Fig.9, reference numeral 47 designates a main speed<br>
change pulley; 58, a V belt wound on and between the main speed change<br>
pulley 47 and an auxiliary speed change pulley 48; 49, a counter pulley which<br>
is coaxial with the auxiliary speed change pulley 48; and 50, a brake actuating<br>
pinion for reciprocatingly moving a rack to bring the rack into and out of<br>
engagement with a brake hole (not shown) in a brake drum (D), thus<br>
controlling the warper drum (A) as desired. Reference numeral 57 designates<br>
a belt extending between pulleys 4 on the driving shaft 2 ; 51, a conveyor belt<br>
moving motor (AC servo motor); 52, a shift lever; 54 a sprocket-wheel; 55, a<br>
chain ; 56, a chain wheel for giving the sun gear 18; 57, 58, both V belts; 59,<br>
a front cover ; 59a, a front guide rod; and (D), the brake drum. Reference<br>
numerals 67a, 67b designate sensors for detecting the passing of the slit of<br>
the slitted plate 28.<br>
Referring next to Fig. 10, reference numeral 69 designates a<br>
movement/stopping change-over level for the conveyor belts 17; 70, a<br>
locking lever for locking the warper drum (A) ; 74, a shedding bar adjusting<br>
lever ; 75, a shedding bar locking handle; 78, a program setting unit; 79, a<br>
controller; 80, a yarn tensioning unit located centrally on the straight part 12 of<br>
the warper drum (A); and (C), a rewinder.<br>
The controller 79 is a control unit for controlling the sample<br>
warper and may control various apparatus connected thereto in accordance<br>
with a program set by a program setting unit 78. The basic structure and<br>
operation of the sample warper (W) are well known as by the above-<br>
mentioned Japanese Patent, so their detailed description is omitted here. As<br>
the conveyor belt 17, needless to say, there may be used an endless<br>
conveyor belt mechanism as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Publication No. 11-315439.<br>
As disclosed in the above Japanese Patent, feed of the conveyor<br>
belt in the sample warper of this kind is controlled by a conveyor belt feed<br>
control unit on the basis of the feed rate of the conveyor belt, namely, a feed<br>
pitch P1, per revolution of the yarn introduction means calculated according<br>
to data input of warping width, the number of warping yarns, and warping<br>
length (the number of warping windings).<br>
In the above-mentioned sample warper, however, the feed rate of<br>
the conveyor belt, or the feed pitch (P), per revolution of the yarn introduction<br>
means is calculated according to the following equation (1) on the basis of the<br>
warping width, the total number of yarns to be warped and the warping length<br>
(the number of warping windings), so that it becomes the same pitch<br>
irrespective of a count (yarn thickness).<br>
Equation (1)<br>
Warping width = P(feed pitch) x the number of warping windings x<br>
the total number of yarns to be warped : Q(warping density) = P(feed pitch) x<br>
the number of warping windings: Warping density (Q) = warping width + the<br>
total number of yarns to be warped:<br>
(P) = warping density (Q) + the number of warping windings<br>
For this reason, as shown in Fig. 6, when yarns (A1) to (A5) and<br>
yarns (B1) to (B5) of the same jcount (the same thickness) are used to perform<br>
one winding warping, a surface contour of the wound yarns is flat.<br>
Incidentally, in Fig. 6, warping) density (Q) = feed pitch (P). Also, even when<br>
warping of yarns (A1) to (A5) and (B1) to (B5) of the same count is performed,<br>
for example, under the same condition of warping density (Q) = yarn diameter<br>
(d) as above and with warping length of five windings (the warping condition<br>
shown in Fig. 5), a surface contour of the wound yarns is flat (Fig. 7). In Fig.<br>
7, warping density (Q) = feed pitch (P) x 5.<br>
However, when yarns (A1) to (A5) (thick yarns) and yarns (B1) to<br>
(B5) (thin yarns) different in the count (yarn thickness) from each other are<br>
used to perform one winding warping under the condition of warping density<br>
Q = yarn diameter d of the yarns (A), for example, as shown in Fig. 4 the<br>
wound yarn state of the thick yarn portion, namely the portion of the yarns<br>
(A1) to (A5) is thick, while the wound yarn state of the thin yarn portion,<br>
namely the portion of the yarns (B1) to (B5) is thin, so that a surface contour of<br>
the wound yarns is undulated.<br>
Also, when both the yarns are warped from the state shown in<br>
Fig. 4 with a warping length of five windings (under the warping condition<br>
shown in Fig. 5), as shown in Fig. 3 the wound yarn state of the thick yarn<br>
portion, namely the portion of the yarns (A1) to (A5) is<br>
further thick, while the wound yarn state of the thin yarn portion, namely, the<br>
portion of the yarns (B1) to (B5) is much thinner than the thickness of the<br>
portion of the yarns (A1) to (A5), so that the surface contour of the wound yarns<br>
becomes largely undulated.<br>
In case the surface contour of the yarns wound on a warper drum<br>
becomes undulated , the circumferential lengths of the respective yarn layers<br>
differ from one another comparing the thick yarn portion with the thin yarn<br>
portion. As a result, on rewinding the yarns wound on the warper drum on a<br>
beam of a rewinder, the difference in circumferential lengths of the yarns<br>
leads to a rewinding tension difference, and rewinding the yarn from the<br>
warper drum with a large diameter to the beam with a small diameter, the<br>
difference in undulation of the surface contour of the wound yarn results in a<br>
further large difference in surface undulation of the yarns rewound on the<br>
beam, which causes big troubles in a next weaving step.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be explained below<br>
with reference to the drawings. These embodiments are merely illustrative,<br>
and the present invention may be modified or changed variously without<br>
departing from the scope or spirit of the technical idea of the present<br>
invention as claimed.<br>
With reference to Figs. 1 and 2, control of a feed rate of a<br>
conveyor belt in the<br>
present invention will be explained. For example, Fig. 2 shows a case where<br>
warping is performed according to feed of a novel conveyor belt in the present<br>
invention under a warping condition similar to that in Fig. 5.<br>
Particularly, it has been found that, in performing six windings of<br>
No. 10 count yarns (A) and (B) (about 0.3 mm diameter), six windings of<br>
No. 40 count yarns (a) to (e)j(about 0.15 mm diameter), and six windings of<br>
No. 10 count yarns (C) and (D) (about 0.3 mm diameter), respectively, it is<br>
necessary to obtain (Q1), (Q2), (P1) and (P2) shown in Fig. 1 in order<br>
to achieve a flat<br>
state of yarns wound on a warper drum. That is, it is necessary to meet the<br>
conditions of (Q1) = 4 x (Q2) and (P1) = 4 X (P2). (Q1) is an interval of the<br>
yarns (A) to (D), the interva] being called as a warping density in this<br>
specification. (Q2) is an interval of the yarns (a) to (e), the interval being<br>
called as a warping density in this specification. (P1) is a value obtained by<br>
the warping density (Q1) of the yarns (A) to (D) + the number of warping<br>
windings, and (P2) is a value obtained by the warping density (Q2) of the<br>
yarns (a) to (e) the number of warping windings, these values being referred<br>
to as a feed rate of a conveyor belt per revolution of a yarn introduction<br>
means in this specification.<br>
[0029]<br>
In view of the diameter values of the yarns, (Q1) = 0.6 mm, (Q2) =<br>
0.15 mm, (P1) = 0.1 mm, and (P2) = 0.025 mm can be obtained from Fig. 1.<br>
Also, the thickness of the yarns (A) to (D) wound on the drum is 0.3 mm X 3 =<br>
0.9 mm, and the thickness of the yarns (a) to (e) is 0.15 mm x 6 = 0.9 mm.<br>
[0030]<br>
From the above, it has been found that, assuming that the diameter<br>
of the yarn is (d) mm, the warping density is (Q), and the number of warping<br>
windings is (N), the thickness Hn of the yarns wound on the drum can be<br>
calculated from the following equation (1).<br>
[0031]<br>
[0032]<br>
Particularly, when the ihickness (H6) of the portion of the yarns (A)<br>
to (D) wound in Fig. 1 is calculated using the above equation (1), the following<br>
value is obtained, which corresponds to the above-mentioned value.<br>
[0034]<br>
Also, when the thickness (H6) of the portion of the yarns (a) to (e) is<br>
calculated using the above equation (1), the following value is obtained,<br>
which corresponds to the above-mentioned value.<br>
Therefore, it is determined that the above equation (1) for<br>
calculation is correct.<br>
[0036]<br>
The yarn thickness (H1) of one winding on the warper drum can be<br>
calculated from the equation (i) according to the following equation (2).<br>
[0038]<br>
Also, the thickness of the yarn in the case of one winding thereof will<br>
be explained as a thickness of one yarn layer in this specification.<br>
From the above, it has been determined that, when yarns of<br>
different counts are warped, the warping density (Q) must be changed in<br>
order to flatten the surface state of the yarns wound on the warper drum.<br>
Here, when yarns (A), (B), (C) of the counts of three kinds are<br>
warped on the warper drum, calculation equations of warping densities (Qa)<br>
(Qb), (Qc) for flattening the surface state of the yarns (A), (B), (C) wound on<br>
the drum will be explained below. Assuming that the thickness of one layer<br>
of the yarn (A) is (Ha), the thickness of one layer of the yarn (B) is (Hb) and<br>
the thickness of one layer of the yarn (C) is (HC), and the diameter of the yarn<br>
(A) is (dA), the diameter of the yarn (B) is (dB) and the diameter of the yarn (C)<br>
is (dC), the following equations are obtained according to the above equation<br>
(2).<br>
Since the above-mentioned condition is Ha = Hb = HC, the following<br>
relational equation is established from the above equations,<br>
[0043]<br>
In the above equations, the following equations (3) are obtained.<br>
In the sample warper, however, when all the yarns have been<br>
warped, the conveyor belt on the warper drum must be moved by a preset<br>
warping width. For meeting this condition, when yarns (A), (B), (C) of three<br>
different counts are warped, assuming that the count of the yarn (A) to be<br>
warped is (Na), the count of the yarn (B) to be warped is (Nb) and the count of<br>
the yarn (C) to be warped is (NC), the warping density of the yarn (A) is (Qa),<br>
the warping density of the yarn (B) is (Qb) and the warping density of the<br>
yarn (C) is (QC), and the warping width is (W), the following equation(4) must<br>
be established.<br>
When (Qa) is obtained according to the above equation (4), the<br>
following equation is obtained.<br>
Also, when (QC) is obtained according to the above equation (4), the<br>
following equation is established.<br>
Arranging (QC) in the above equation, the following equation is<br>
obtained.<br>
(QC) can be obtained according to the following equation (7).<br>
The above calculated values are the warping densities (QA), (Qb),<br>
(QC). By dividing these values by the number of warping windings, the<br>
conveyor belt feed rates (Pa), (Pb), (Pc) per revolution of the yarn introduction<br>
means can be easily calculated<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 1529104, an AC servomotor is<br>
used as the motor for feeding the conveyor belt in the sample warper, and the<br>
number of pulses per revolution of the yarn introduction means to be sent to<br>
the motor is calculated on the basis of the warping width, the number of<br>
warping yarns and the number of warping windings, the servo motor being<br>
controlled via a position control board and a driver on the basis of the number<br>
of pulses. The present invention proposes calculation methods and<br>
calculation equations for improving a drawback occurring in the conventional<br>
sample warper where the conveyor belt feed rate per revolution of the yarn<br>
introduction means is the same pitch irrespective of the count of the yarn. In<br>
addition, the present invention proposes a sample warper where data about<br>
yarn kinds and counts are preliminarily stored in a setting device (such as a<br>
personal computer or the like) and when yarn kinds, counts, warping width,<br>
the number of warping yarns, the number of warping windings, and pattern<br>
data are input into the setting device, the number of yarns corresponding to<br>
each count (each yarn kind) is calculated and the number of pulses per<br>
revolution of the yarn introduction means is calculated according to the<br>
above-mentioned calculation equation by the setting device so as to send the<br>
calculated values to a position control board for controlling the feed rate of<br>
the servo motor, so that warping with a low warping density is performed in a<br>
thick yarn and warping with a high warping density is performed in a thin<br>
yarn. Incidentally, the above-mentioned calculation equations are utilized to<br>
calculate the above values in a computer or a calculator, the calculated values<br>
may individually be input to the sample warper.<br>
According to the present invention, preliminarily inputting and<br>
storing yarn diameters corresponding to counts as one of data for warping<br>
and inputting counts together with a pattern data fox warping, a conveyor<br>
belt feed pitch per revolution of a yarn introduction means is calculated so as<br>
to be suited for the counts of the yarns as well as a warping width, the<br>
number of warping yarns, and a warping length (the number of warping<br>
windings), and a conveyor belt feed pitch per revolution of the yarn<br>
introduction means, namely the conveyor belt feed rate, is controlled<br>
according to the counts of the yarns (thicknesses and diameters) so that a<br>
finished surface of the yarns wound on a warper drum is in a flat state<br>
without undulation, thereby solving the afore-mentioned troubles in the next<br>
weaving step,<br>
[0069]<br>
Obviously various minor changes and modifications of the present<br>
invention are possible in the light of the above teaching. It is therefore to be<br>
understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may<br>
be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br>
