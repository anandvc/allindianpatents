				<td>This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/439,950, filed January 14, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced by full citations. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, is a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of an array of autoantibodies, including antibodies to dsDNA, to nuclear antigens and to ribonucleoproteins. SLE affects approximately 1 in 2000 individuals (U.S. 1 in 700 women). The disease primarily affects young women, with a female-to male ratio of approximately 9:1.<br>
Systemic lupus can affect almost any organ or system of the body. Systemic lupus may include periods in which few, if any, symptoms are evident ("remission") and other times when the disease becomes more active ("flare"). Most often when people mention "lupus," they are referring to the systemic form, of the disease.<br>
Corticosteroids are the mainstay in treating systemic autoimmune disorders. Life threatening, severely disabling manifestations  of  SLE  are  treated  with  high  doses  of<br><br><br>
glucocorticoids (1-2 mg/kg/day). Undesirable effects of chronic glucocorticoids include an array of prominent adverse effects such as cushingoid habitus, central obesity, hypertension, infection, capillary fragility, hirsutism, accelerated osteoporosis, cataracts, diabetes mellitus, myopathy and psychosis. In addition to corticosteroid toxicity, patient compliance to a dosage regimen also poses a serious problem.<br>
Cytotoxic agents are also used for controlling active disease, reducing the rate of disease flares, and reducing steroid requirements. Undesirable side effects of the latter include bone marrow depz'ession, increased infections with opportunistic organisms, irreversible ovarian failure, alopecia and increased risk of malignancy.<br>
SLE is an inflammatory disease for which to date there is no definitive treatment or cure. The disease results in acute and chronic complications. The only treatments available are palliative, aimed at relieving acute symptoms and preventing chronic complications, often with profound side effects. There is therefore an unmet need in this field, and both physicians and patients would welcome new treatments which could potentially eliminate or reduce the unwanted manifestations of the disease.<br>
Peptides based on the complementarity-determining region of the human monoclonal anti-DMA 16/6Id antibody capable of immunomodulating SLE associated responses have been disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO 02/067843 A2, the entire contents of which are hereby incoi-porated by reference. In particular, region CDR1 was found to inhibit the proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PEL) of SLE patients to the human anti-DNA 16/6ld mAB, and to<br><br>
ameliorate disease manifestations of mice afflicted with spontaneous or experimental SLE.<br>
Human CDRl, Compound 1, shown in Figure 1, is a synthetic peptide of 19 amino acids based on the complementarity-determining region 1 (CDRl) of the human anti-dsDNA mAb denoted 16/6 Id (Waisman, A., et al. "Modulation of marine systemic lupus erythematosus with peptides based on complementarity determining regions of pathogenic anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies." Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, (1997), 94(4): 4620-4625).<br>
In experimental SLE models - Balb/c mice and SLE-prone mice, i.e. (NZBxNSW)Fl mice - treatment with either mCDR based-peptides or Compound 1 significantly reduced the SLE related findings, notably immune complex deposits (ICD) in the kidney, proteinuria and leukopenia. The treatment had no effect on the 16/6 Id specific antibody response (Waisman, A., et al. "Modulation of murine systemic lupus erythematosus with peptides based on complementarity determining regions of pathogenic anti -DNA monoclonal antibodies." Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1997), 94(4): 620; Eilat, E., et al. , "Prevention of systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease in (NZBxNZW)Fl mice by treating with CDRl- and CDR3- based peptides of pathogenic autoantibody" J. Clin. Irnnunol. (2000), 20: 268; Eilat, E., et al., "The mechanism by which a peptide based on complementarity determining region-1 of pathogenic anti-DNA antibody ameliorates e;qoerimental SLE" (2001), Proc. Natl .Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98: 1148) .<br>
These peptides, like many peptides, are not very soluble. Therefore, formulations that improve the solubility of the peptides are desired.<br><br>

Experimental Details<br>
Example 1:  Formulation Development for Compound 1<br>
The human hCDRl peptide (Compound 1) is described in PCT International Publication Mo WO 02/067848, published September 6, 2002, and can be prepared by methods well known in the art, (see, for example, Peptides: Synthesis, Structure and Applications, ed. by B. Gutte, Academic Press, 1995; Peptide Synthesis Protocols, ed. By M. Pennington and B. Dunn, Humana Press, 1994; Schnolzer, M. et al. , "In situ neutralization in Boc-chemistry solid phase synthesis. Rapid, High yield assembly of difficult sequences." Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. (1992) 40: 180-193).<br>
Compound 1 is a synthetic polypeptide composed	of 19 amino<br>
acids.  It  is  provided  as  an  acetate  salt.	The  aqueous<br>
solubility of the peptide has been determined to	be less than<br>
0.5 mg/ml. Figure 1 shows compound 1 as an acetate	salt.<br>
In order to develop a formulation with peptide concentration exceeding 2 mg/ml, preferably up to 10 mg/ml, experiments with several solubility enhancers were performed. The preliminary experiments indicated that a concentration of 2 mg/ml cannot be easily attained. In order to develop a formulation for subcutaneous injection, it is also desirable that the pH be in the range of 4 to 9 and that the solution be iso-osmotic.<br>
Based on an extensive literature survey, a few principal approaches were adopted in order to produce a formulation with maximal solubility. The factors considered were:<br>
^ pH adjustment and buffers<br>
» Solvents<br>
« Co-solvents<br><br>
Solubilizing agents<br>
Methods<br>
Compound 1 was dissolved in the chosen solubility enhancer solution either separately or in combination with other excipients and the solutions were stirred for at least an hour. The pH was adjusted if needed. The solutions were visually examined to estimate the solubility and sent for analytical assay determination. For a few chosen formulations, biological activity was also tested.<br>
Results<br>
Table 1 presents the type of solubility enhancers used for the formulation development. Tables 2 and 3 summarise the experiments that were performed with the various solubility enhancers. Table 2 summarises the initial screening performed with peptide concentrations in the range of 5 to 10 mg/.ml. The experimental work that was performed with higher peptide concentration was then repeated with the lower doses (see table 3)<br>
Initial tests indicated that Compound 1 was more soluble at the limits of the desired pH levels, both acidic and basic, but was less stable at the basic pH range. Thus, several buffers and pH adjustment agents were tested, including acetate buffer, citrate buffer and sodium carbonate. None of the initially tested buffers achieved the desired peptide solubility level. Only above pH 9.2 and below pH 3.0 were solubility le~els of 2 mg/ml observed. Nevertheless, at the initial stage, formulations with acetate buffer and citrate buffer (with Mannitol as a tonicity agent) were selected for initial toxicology studies. These formulations were tested for biological activity and proven active.<br><br>
Non aqueous solvents (see table 1) such as Ethanol, Glycerin, Propylene glycol, Chremophore and their combinations were tested but did not increase the solubility of Compound 1. A solution of 30% DMA (dimethyl-acetamide) yielded solubility in the desired ranges (5 to 9 mg/ml) , but was not suitable for a pharmaceutical formulation due to its toxicity profile. Improved solubility was also observed using 30% (w/w) PEG 400 (5 to 9 mg/ml) . This latter formulation was chosen for the toxicology studies, but it has proved to be both inactive in the biological assay, and may have been the cause of some adverse effects in a mouse toxicity study. Thus, it was decided not to further pursue this formulation. In view of the preliminary experiments non-aqueous solvents were not used in the subject formulations.<br>
Several amino acids (see table 1) including L-Arginine, L-Glutamic acid, L-Glycine and L-Lysine were tested to improve the protein solubility. The solubility of the peptide in L-Arginine was at the desired level but the resulting pH was above 9. An attempt to decrease the pH or use an Arginine HC1 salt resulted in precipitation of the peptide. Human Serum Albumin was also tested and improved the solubility of the peptide at low peptide concentrations (1 mg/ml) (see table 3). However, due to its potential immunogenicity and the low peptide solubility, it was not utilised in further experiments.<br>
Bulking agents (see table 1) including Mannitol, Sorbitol and Dextran were tested alone and in combination with other excipients, but did not improve the solubility of the peptide in solution.<br><br>
Co-solvents (see table I), including Polysorbate 20 and Polysorbate 80 were tested alone and in combination with other excipients. While lower concentrations of Polysorbates (up to 6%) did not improve the solubility of the peptide, higher concentrations (up to 10% - see table 2) improved the solubility of the peptide up to 2 mg/ml. However, such high concentrations of Polysorbates were deemed unsuitable for pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Two types of cyclodextrins, both approved for use in marketed parenteral products', were also tested: Hydroxypropyl-|3-cyclodextrin and Sulfobutylether-j3-cyclodextrin (Captisol®) . Both markedly increased the solubility of the peptide (concentrations in the levels of 10 mg/ml for Hydroxypropyl-fi-cyclodextrin and 2.5 for Captisol®) . The biological activity of the two cyclodextrin formulations was tested and was found to be equal to the activity of the peptide alone.<br>
CAPTISOL® is a commercially available polyanionic (5-cyclodextrin derivative with a sodium sulfonate salt separated from the hydrophobic cavity by a butyl ether spacer group, or sulfobutylether (SEE) . CAPTISOL® is the trade name for CyDex Inc.'s hepta-substituted sulfobutylether (5-cyclodextrin (SBE7-(3-CD) preparation (www.captisol.com). The structure of CAPTISOL® allows drug molecules to fit in the hydrophobic cavity, thereby isolating the drug molecule from the aqueous solvent. Because the outer surface of CAPTISOL® is hydrophilic, the solubility of the completed drug molecule is thereby enhanced. The use of cyclode::trins to enhance the solubility of drug molecules is disclosed in U.S. Patent Wos. 5,134,127 and 5,376,645, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
According to the literature of CyDex Inc., CAPTISOL® is safe when administered pareiiterally and does not exhibit the nephrotoxicity associated with beta-cyclodextrin. Relative to beta-cyclodextrin, CAPTISOL® provides comparable or higher complexation characteristics and superior water solubility in excess of 90 grams/100ml - a 50-fold improvement .<br>
Conclusions<br>
Several solubility enhancers were found to match the desired solubility range: • DMA, PEG-400, dimethyl-acetamide, polyethylene glycol, polyoxylated castor oil, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, l-ethenyl-2-pyrrolidinone, Polysorbate 20,<br>
Polysorbate 80, Hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin and Sulfobutylether-fi-cycldextrin (Captisol®) . Of these solubility enhancers both cyclodextrins have proven to be superior with respect to solubility, biological activity and stability. Thus, it was decided to select Captisol® as the solubility enhancer for use in Example 5 formulations and to further study both cyclodextrin formulations. The final formulation for the Example 5 clinical studies consists of: 120 mg/ml of Captisol® in water with the desired amount of peptide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.5 mg/ml), and HC1 and NaOH for pH adjustment.<br>

Example 2: Preparation protocol for solution of Compound 1 in Captisol®<br>
Standard dissolution methods, such as mixing dry Compound 1 and dry Captisol® into water or adding Compound 1 to a prepared solution of Captisol® and water did not result in complete dissolution at the desired concentrations. Several different concentrations of both Compound 1 and Captisol® were tested at various pH levels. However, the following method for producing a solution of Compound 1 in Captisol® resulted in complete dissolution at the desired concentrations.<br>
Materials: Captisol®, Compound 1 and water<br>
Method:<br>
1.	Weigh the appropriate amount of Captisol® to give a<br>
final concentration of 120 mg/ml.<br>
2.	Add 80% of the final amount of water and mix for 10<br>
minutes with a magnetic stirrer.<br>
3 .  Weigh Compound 1 to give a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml, 2.0 mg/ml, 1.0 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml or 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
4.	Add the peptide to the Captisol® solution. Mix for 1<br>
hour.<br>
5.	Raise the pH to obtain clear solution (in the 2.0<br>
mg/ml formulation there might be a need to raise the<br>
pH slightly above 9). pH should be adjusted using HC1<br>
1.0 N and NaOH 1.0 N. Mix for 10 minutes.<br>
6.	Correct the pH to the range of 7.5 to 3.5 if needed<br>
(using either HC1 or HaOH 1.0 N).<br>
7.	Add water to final volume.<br><br>
8.	Filter   the   solution   through   a   0.2u   cellulose   acetate<br>
filter,<br>
9.	Record final pH.<br>
10. Dispense  into aliquots  and  store  at  the proper temperature.<br>
Example 3:  Lyophilization of Compound 1 and Captisol® solution<br>
The current lyophilization process differs from other lyophilization processes in that the percentage of solids in the formulation is 'high (12%) whereas lyophilized products normally contain between 5 and 10% solids.<br>
Equipment<br>
The freeze drier used was an Edwards lyophilizer Lyoflex 0.6. The equipment IQ/OQ was performed and checked for compliance by quality assurance prior to the process development.<br>
Solutions of Compound 1 and Captisol® at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml, l.Omg/ml and 2.5mg/ml of Compound 1 were prepared. The fill-volume was adjusted 1 ml (1.05 gr) .<br>
Main process steps:<br>
1.	Freezing<br>
2.	Holding (at low temperature)<br>
3.	Drying under vacuum in two stages:<br>
3.1. Primary drying - shelf warming to an upper hold temperature, controlling shelf temperature at the upper hold level.<br>
Secondary drying - Pressure reduction to a minimal value at the upper hold shelf temperature.<br><br>
"latches 1-3<br>
Freezing - Freezing was from room temperature to -40°C within 2 hours. Shelves were held at -40°C for 3 hours.<br>
Drying - Drying was performed at 110 fibar pressure. Shelf temperature was increased to 20°C over 13 hours and held at that temperature for additional 13 hours.<br>
Total process time was 31 hours.<br>
Results:<br>
Water content results were:<br>
Batch no. 1: 3.8%<br>
Batch no. 2: 4.0% and<br>
Batch no. 3: 4.9%<br>
Batches 4 and 5<br>
Since the water content results of the processes leading to batches 1, 2 and 3 were higher then the desired value, it was decided to add a secondary drying step at the same temperature and at low pressure.<br>
Drying - Drying was performed at llOjibar pressure. Shelf temperature was increased to 20°C over 13 hours and held at that temperature for additional 13 hours (Batch 4) or 8 hours (Batch 5). Pressure was decreased to lOjibar for additional 5 hours.<br>
Total process time was 36 hours.<br>
Results:<br>
Water content results were<br>
Batch 4: Placebo: 3.0%,<br><br>
1 mg/ml: 3.9%. Batch 5: Placebo: 4.1%<br>
Conclusions<br>
As shown, a satisfactory lyophilization process for Compound 1 with Captisol® was developed. Due to the high percentage of solids and hence the condensed cake, the developed process is longer then the currently available lyophilization cycles for peptides and it exhibits an additional secondary drying stage. Table 4 summarizes the developed process.<br>

Preparation of 12% cap ti sol® solution<br>
1.2 gr of captisol® were dissolved in 10 ml of WFI to yield a solution of 12% captisol®.<br>
Experimental procedure<br>
Mice weighing<br>
Mice were weighed before immunization. Average mice weight: 19.01 ± 0.97 gr<br>
The immunization was performed by injecting 100 microliters of the emulsion (50 microliters into each hind footpad).<br>
Following the immunisation step the mice were treated by s.c. injection of 200 ul from the designated Compound 1 DP or 12% captisol® treatment solutions, at the back of their neck.<br><br>
In-Vitro culture<br>
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. LN were extracted from the hind legs and were transferred to a sterile petri dish containing about 5 mL RPMI. The cells were extracted by gentle squeezing of the tissue against a 200 micrometer mesh stainless steel net. The cells were collected and centrifuged at 300 G for 10 minutes at RT.<br>
Single cell suspensions were prepared from pooled LN of each experimental group.<br>
2.5 and 5.0 million cells/ml/well suspensions were cultured with Compound 1 RS (0-100 ^g/ml) in EM-1.<br>
Secretion of IFN-y and TGF-(3, as indication of cellular response, were determined by ELISA of culture media (48hrs for IFN-y and 72hrs for TGF-|3) .<br>

Observations<br>
IFN-y secretion<br>
1.	In the placebo group, a linear dose response upon Compound<br>
1 activation in-vitro was shown. This graph resembles the<br>
graph  obtained  for  the  Ex-vivo  model  with  the  same<br>
immunization dose (SO^g/mouse) and culturing medium (EM-1) .<br>
2.	There was a dose response upon Compound 1 activation in<br>
vitro within all the tested groups.<br>
3.	Significant inhibition of IFN-y secretion was seen with all<br>
the doses used for treatment (an average of 95% inhibition<br>
with treated dose of 25|iig/niouse) . A reverse correlation<br>
between the dose served for treatment and % inhibition can<br>
be found, mainly when 5xl06 cells/well were used. When<br>
2.5xl06 cells/well were used,  treatment of animals with<br>
SOjLtg/mouse gave better inhibition than 100 or 2QO(ig. The<br>
point of 25p.g is missing (lack of cells) .<br>
4.	A better inhibition was seen when SxlO6 cells/well were used<br>
instead of 2.5xl06 cellsAvell.<br>
5.	In the linear range of the graphs, SD of % inhibition was<br>

Example 6: Optimizations of freeze drying cycle with Compound 1 and Captisol® for injection (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 ing/vial)<br>
Purpose<br>
The purpose of this -study was to optimize the freeze drying cycle for Compound 1 with captisol® for injection to improve the shape of the lyophilization cake and avoid collapse and cracking. Thus it was decided to improve and optimise the lyophilization cycle. This cycle is transferred to the production lyophilisers for the manufacturing of the phase I batches.<br>
Process optimisation<br>
Batches of peptide at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml l.Omg/ml, 2.5mg/ml and Placebo were prepared and several freeze drying cycles were performed. The freeze drier used was an Edwards lyophilizer Lyoflex 0.6.<br>
Solubility, water content and cake appearance were tested. According to the obtained results a new lyophilization cycle for Compound 1 was selected. Due to the high percentage of solids (12%) and hence the condensed cake, the new process is longer than the lyophilisation cycle in Example 3 and exhibits an additional primary drying stage. Table 12 summarises the differences between the processes.<br><br>

Patients participating in clinical trials are to be treated with Compound 1 using Captisol® (sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium) as the excipient. For this reason, it was important to determine whether treatment of (NZBxNZW) Fl mice with the formulation of Compound 1 given in Captisol* would have the same beneficial effects on lupus symptoms as observed when this strain of mice was treated with Compound 1 in PBS.<br>
To this end, (NSBxNSW)Fl female mice (about 8 months old) were divided into 3 groups that were treated subcutaneously once a week for 10 weeks either with Captisol'" alone (n=8) or with 25 or 50 ^g/mouse Compound 1 in CaptisolS1 (n=9 and 10, respectively). These doses were selected since prior studies indicated that doses in this range were more effective in ameliorating SLE symptoms than the higher doses tested (100 and 200 jug/mouse) . The<br><br>
Same Thatch of drug "substance was used in this study and in the first Phase I clinical trial with Compound 1.<br>
The mice were followed for anti-dsDNA antibodies and for proteinuria. When the mice were sacrificed, the intensity of ICD was determined in kidneys.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 5, no significant differences between groups could be observed in the levels of dsDNA-specific antibodies after 10 treatment injections.<br>
Table 13 also shows that the beneficial effect of treatment with Compound 1 could be observed starting from the 5th injection and it was sustained up to the 10th injection. The mean levels of proteinuria in the Captisol® control group were consistently higher than in the Compound 1 -treated groups. Table 13 also shows that a reduction in the intensity of ICD was observed in kidneys of both Compound 1 dose groups. There was an overall trend showing that the lower dose (25 p,g/mouse) was more effective than the higher dose (50 fig/mouse) in reducing the clinical symptoms of SLE in these mice.<br><br>

Figure 6 shows representative sections of one kidney from each treatment group. The top row sections are from a Captisol®-treated mouse, the mid-row sections are from a mouse treated with 50 pg/mouse Compound 1 and the bottom row sections are from a mouse treated with 25 jig/mouse Compound 1. It can be seen that the intensity of immune complex deposits observed in kidney sections of mice treated with Compound 1 (dissolved in Captisol*) at either dose level was much lower than that observed in the control group.<br>

Results of Phase la clinical study:<br>
Subject Disposition and SLE Characteristics<br>
Thirty six (36) study subjects entered and completed this study per protocol. The majority of subjects (34) in all treatment groups were female (94.4%) and Caucasian (30, 83.3%). The mean age for all treatment groups was 35.6 years (range of means from 32 to 39 years). Most of the subjects (91.7%) had between 4 to 6 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria and a mean group SLEDAI 2K score ranged from 2.1 to 4.1.<br>
Safety Results<br>
There was no prominent difference between study drug treatment groups and the placebo group in the incidence of AEs. The most common AEs in all groups were headache, classified as mild or moderate in nature and injection site reaction classified as mild in nature. Dose response was not seen. No serious adverse event (SAE) or AE classified as severe occurred during the study.<br><br>
Mo clinically significant effect attributable to study drug was seen for hematology, biochemistry or urinalysis values.<br>
No clinically significant effect attributable to the study drug was seen for vital signs parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation).<br>
No clinically significant effect attributable to the study drug was seen for temperature and weight.<br>
No differences of clinical significance were seen between Compound 1 -treated groups and placebo for categorical ECG measurements and digitised ECG parameters. No PCS QTc absolute value and no QTc change from baseline &gt; 60 msec was recorded. A similar number of subjects in Compound 1 -treated and placebo groups had QTcB change from baseline between 30 and 60 msec.<br>
No clinically significant effects of Compound 1 on physical exam were noted.<br>
Immunology Results<br>
Evaluation of serum samples from all subjects indicated that a single subcutaneous administration of Compound 1 at the dose levels of 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/patient did not induce the development of anti-Compound 1 specific antibodies. Seven subjects had a response to Compound 1 above the cut-off. These elevated levels of antibodies were already present prior to dosing. Wo increase in the levels of antibodies was observed, in the follow up period (two months) of the study. The sera of these subjects were analysed for the isotype of the reactive antibodies. The response in two of the subjects was associated with the IgM isotype and with the IgG isotype in two others. None of the seven had specific IgE antibodies.<br><br>
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PEL) assay showed that 50 % of the subjects (18) were classified as responders (SI&gt;2) with similar distribution in all treatment groups. The T cell response was relatively low and no association between Compound 1 treatment dose or concentration used in the assay and responder/ non-responder status could be detected, taking into consideration that only a single SC dose of the study drug was administered. Also, no indication of increased incidence of responder status over time was observed. The tetanus toxoid (TTX) assay that serves as a safety control shows that the response to TTX was preserved throughout the study period in all treatment groups indicating that Compound 1 in captisol® did not change the immunological response to TTX recall antigen.<br>
The immunological findings are the result of the administration of only a single dose of the study drug Compound 1.<br>
Disease Activity Results<br>
No clinically significant effects of Compound. 1 on the SLEDAI score (change of &gt; 3, ^12 points) were noted during the study except for one subject in the 0.5 mg treatment group for whom a change in the SLEDAI score of 2 to 10 points was recorded between baseline and week 4 on the basis of an urinalysis showing pyuria. This urinalysis finding was not confirmed by the investigator as a lupus flare per protocol definition and was resolved with no treatment change.<br>
Coaclusiozis<br>
This Phase la study showed that a single subcutaneous injected dose of Compound 1 of 0.5, 1 or 2.5 mg in 120 mg Captisol <b> was safe and well tolerated and allows continuation to a phase Ib multiple dose study.<br><br>
