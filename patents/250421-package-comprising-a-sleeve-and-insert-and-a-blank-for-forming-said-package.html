				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a controlled easy-<br>
access package for child resistant, senior-friendly<br>
storage of unit dose products or the like. The package is<br>
provided with a locking function preventing a child from<br>
getting access to the product inside the package. The<br>
package can be opened and closed numerous times and then<br>
finally disposed of.<br>
The present invention relates to a package<br>
comprising a top panel, a bottom panel, a first side<br>
panel connecting the top panel and the bottom panel to<br>
each other and a second side panel also connecting the<br>
top panel and the bottom panel to each other, wherein the<br>
bottom panel, the first side panel, the top panel and the<br>
second side panel form a sleeve having a cross-section<br>
essentially formed as a rectangle, wherein the sleeve is<br>
adapted to receive an insert being slidable within said<br>
sleeve along a sliding direction being normal to said<br>
rectangle.<br>
The present invention further relates to a blank<br>
comprising a top panel, a bottom panel, a first side<br>
panel and a second side panel, the second side panel<br>
comprising a first portion and a second portion, wherein<br>
the bottom panel and the first side panel are foldable in<br>
relation to each other about a first fold line forming a<br>
hinge between the bottom panel and the first side panel,<br>
the first side panel and the top panel are foldable in<br>
relation to each other about a second fold line forming a<br>
hinge between the first side panel and the top panel, the<br>
top panel and the second portion of the second side panel<br>
are foldable in relation to each other about a third fold<br>
line forming a hinge between the top panel and the second<br>
portion of the second side panel, and wherein the first<br>
portion of the second side panel and the bottom panel are<br>
foldable in relation to each other about a fourth fold<br>
line forming a hinge between the first portion of the<br>
second side panel and the bottom panel, wherein said<br>
first, second, third and fourth fold lines are parallel<br>
with each other.<br>
Technical background<br>
EP 1 002 744 A1 discloses a two-piece paperboard<br>
container that houses a unit dose product on an internal<br>
slide card within an outer paperboard shell. This package<br>
has two internal locks -hat prevent the slide card from<br>
being pulled out without triggering a lock release<br>
mechanism. This package is focused around providing a<br>
child resistant, senior-friendly unit dose package that<br>
can be opened and closed numerous times and then finally<br>
disposed of.<br>
The paperboard shell is formed by folding a blank<br>
consisting of three major panels connected by two narrow<br>
panels. The centre major panel of the blank is adapted to<br>
form a bottom surface of the package, whereas one of the<br>
two outer major panels of the blank is adapted to form a<br>
top surface of the package. The other outer panel is<br>
adapted to form an inner top surface of the package. The<br>
inner top surface and the top surface are glued to each<br>
other.<br>
The panel forming the inner top surface is provided<br>
with a through-going opening or cut-out. The panel<br>
forming the top surface is provided with a score line<br>
formed as an oval. The panel is cut through along this<br>
score line. The oval score line and the through-going<br>
opening are positioned on the two outer panels in such a<br>
manner that when forming a package the oval score line<br>
will be positioned on top of the through-going hole. The<br>
portion of the panel being within this oval score line<br>
may be pushed as a push-button.<br>
The internal slide card is provided with a tab,<br>
which is formed at the leading edge (leading when the<br>
slide card is inserted into the package) and refolded<br>
backwards over the slide card. When the slide card is<br>
inserted completely inside the shell, the refolded tab<br>
will due to its spring-back properties enter into the<br>
through-going opening of the panel forming the inner top<br>
surface.<br>
When a user pulls the slide card the tab will be<br>
forced into the through-going opening and thus block the<br>
slide card from being pulled out of the package. However,<br>
if the user pushes the push-button the tab will be pushed<br>
out of the through-going opening and the slide card may<br>
thus be pulled out of the package.<br>
At the opening, through which the slide card is<br>
inserted into the package, the package is provided with<br>
an inwardly folded tab, which interacts with the refolded<br>
tab of the slide card to prevent the slide card from<br>
being pulled completely out of the package.<br>
However, this package does not represent a<br>
satisfactory design. Already when a refolded tab looses<br>
only a portion of its spring-back properties (after being<br>
pushed inwardly a few times) it will not make a complete<br>
spring-back movement. The design of the package disclosed<br>
in EP 1 002 744 A1 relies on the thickness of the panel<br>
forming the inner top surface. The locking function is<br>
thus made dependent upon the selection of sufficiently<br>
thick material for the package. Consequently, already<br>
minor short-comings of the spring-back of the refolded<br>
tab will result in that the refolded tab will not enter<br>
the through-going opening and the locking function is not<br>
accomplished. Moreover, any lack of spring-back of the<br>
push-button will result in that the push-button will<br>
occupy a space in the through-going opening and thus<br>
exert a force onto the refolded tab being<br>
counterproductive to the spring-back of the refolded tab.<br>
WO 02/38454 Al discloses a package made of<br>
cardboard, comprising a sleeve and an insert, the sleeve<br>
being provided with at least one catch tab located on the<br>
inside of the sleeve and provided with at least one<br>
projection, sc that the catch tab forms an angle with the<br>
upper wall of the sleeve. At least one locking tab is<br>
provided on the insert, which is arranged so as to be at<br>
least in part inserted between the catch tab and the<br>
upper wail. At least one operating tab is provided, in<br>
addition to which the sleeve is provided with at least<br>
one cut-out next to the operating tab, the operating tab<br>
being arranged so as to be pressed by a user against<br>
locking tab, movement of the insert in the sliding<br>
direction towards the opening being made possible.<br>
Although it has been found that this design offers a<br>
satisfactory locking function it has been proven<br>
difficult to use this design for so-called flat-laid,<br>
pre-glued distribution of a package.<br>
WO 03/101840 A1 discloses a package comprising a<br>
sleeve of essentially parallelepipedal shape, and an<br>
insert, which can be inserted into and withdrawn from the<br>
sleeve in a sliding direction through an opening in the<br>
sleeve, the sleeve comprising four longitudinal walls,<br>
which are essentially parallel to the sliding direction.<br>
The package is characterized in that the sleeve is<br>
provided with a first stop tab which extends from a first<br>
tc a second of the longitudinal walls, the tab being at<br>
least partly separated from the first longitudinal wall<br>
and the second longitudinal wail in that the insert has a<br>
first locking edge, the insert being prevented, upon<br>
contact of the first locking edge with the first stop<br>
tab, from moving out of the sleeve, and in that the first<br>
locking edge can, by elastic deformation of a part of the<br>
insert by means of manoeuvring by a user, be moved so<br>
that its movement past the first stop tab is made<br>
possible.<br>
Although it has been found that this design offers a<br>
satisfactory locking function it has been proven<br>
difficult to use this design for so-called flat-laid,<br>
pre-glued distribution of a package.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
basic design of a locking function which on one hand<br>
provides a satisfactory locking function and which on the<br>
other hand offers the possibility of easily being adapted<br>
for so-called flat-laid, pre-glued distribution of a<br>
package being provided with said locking function.<br>
This object has in accordance with the invention<br>
been achieved with a package of the kind being defined by<br>
the introductory part of the application and further<br>
defined by the characterising features that the package<br>
further comprises a locking member extending from. a first<br>
position located at or at a first distance from a first<br>
inside corner of the rectangle, into the cross-section<br>
and to a second position located at or at a second<br>
distance from a second inside corner of the rectangle,<br>
and that the locking member forms a continuous or broken<br>
arch within said cross-section, wherein the locking<br>
member has an extension greater than a distance between<br>
the first and second corners. By introducing a locking<br>
member of this kind it is possible to achieve a<br>
satisfactory locking function. The locking member will<br>
extend as a continuous arch or as a broken arch, for<br>
example as a trapezoid or a flattened V-shape, into the<br>
cross-section of the sleeve. An arch will have a portion<br>
extending from an inside surface of the package wall into<br>
the cross-section of the package and another portion<br>
extending back to an inside surface of the package wall.<br>
Thus, the arch will during a portion of its extension be<br>
located a distance from all the inside surfaces cf the<br>
walls. The arch may have any geometrical shape<br>
introducing this portion extending into the cross-section<br>
and located at a distance from the inside wails. An<br>
insert introduced into the sleeve may be designed with<br>
great design-freedom since the locking member establishes<br>
a robust design considering the locking function. An<br>
insert provided with locking tabs folded, along a line<br>
essentially parallel with cr slightly inclined in<br>
relation to the sliding direction, back over the insert<br>
may be inserted into the sleeve. The locking member will<br>
during this insertion force the locking tabs to be<br>
refolded to pass further into the sleeve. The locking<br>
tabs of the insert are, after passing the locking member,<br>
allowed to spring back behind or into an opening of the<br>
locking member. When the insert is to be removed from the<br>
sleeve, the locking tab will not be allowed to pass the<br>
locking member. One cr more panels, in the preferred<br>
embodiments the top panel, is provided with a partial<br>
cut-out such that a portion of the panel may be folded<br>
into the sleeve and exert a force onto the locking tab of<br>
the insert. The locking tab is thus refolded to an extent<br>
where it may pass the locking member of the package.<br>
Since the locking member will extend as an arch it will<br>
not be associated with problems of slight lack of spring-<br>
back of the locking tab or the like. Even when the<br>
locking tab looses a significant amount of its spring-<br>
back the locking function will still work since a<br>
significant refolding is needed for allowing passage of<br>
the locking tab past the locking member.<br>
With the above mentioned positioning of the locking<br>
member in relation to the cross-section of the sleeve it<br>
is possible to adapt the basic design for flat-laid<br>
distribution of the package. It should be noted that when<br>
discussing flat-laid, pre-glued distribution several<br>
different possibilities are considered. A non-exhaustive<br>
listing involves a flat-laid package with pre-glued side<br>
panels and pre-glued locking member, a flat-laid package<br>
with a locking member pre-glued but with the side panels<br>
not being glued, an non-folded blank where the locking<br>
member is pre-glued [almost as a flat-laid package with<br>
only the locking member pre-glued). Thus, pre-glued can<br>
refer to the gluing of the locking member and/or the<br>
gluing of the side panels.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention the<br>
locking member is a flattened V-shaped bridge extending<br>
from an upper left corner to an upper right corner of the<br>
sleeve. The locking member has an extension greater than<br>
a distance between the first and second corners. The<br>
bridge has an arc length being longer than the straight<br>
distance between the two corners and will thus be forced<br>
zo extend into the cross-section of the sleeve. When the<br>
package is flat-laid the panels being laid parallel with<br>
each other will exhibit an imaginary lengthening. This is<br>
due to the fact that a paperboard does not fold about a<br>
single geometrical line but will actually be bent and<br>
deformed in a folding area. However, within the field of<br>
the invention a fold line is the terminology used for<br>
such a folding. Thus, when flat-laid, the package will<br>
allow the locking member to form a straight line without<br>
any undesired folding of the locking member counteracting<br>
the flat-laying of the package. The locking member may<br>
extend from a point a first distance from the upper left<br>
corner along the second side panel tc a point a second<br>
distance from the right upper corner along the first side<br>
panel. If the first distance is equal to the second<br>
distance the above-mentioned imaginary lengthening will<br>
still occur. If the first distance is larger than the<br>
second distance and the package is flat-laid such that<br>
the second side panel is folded against the bottom panel<br>
an additional imaginary lengthening will occur since the<br>
first position of the locking member will not be<br>
translated along the bottom panel the same amount as the<br>
second position. The bridge-forming locking member may as<br>
a blank have the same length as the corresponding top<br>
panel, if it is connected to the insides of the side<br>
panels, since it then will experience an imaginary<br>
shortening of the available space when the package is<br>
erected. Thus, the locking member will extend as an arch<br>
into the cross-section.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention the<br>
locking member is formed as a broken arch extending from<br>
a first position a first distance from an upper left<br>
corner along the top panel to a second position in a<br>
lower left corner. When the package is flat-laid the<br>
locking member will collapse further into the cross-<br>
section. If the distance from the lower left corner along<br>
the second side panel and along the top panel to the<br>
first position is equal to the arc length of the locking<br>
member the locking member will allow flat-laying of the<br>
package. This gives that the locking member has an<br>
extension greater than a distance between the first and<br>
second corners. Compared to this situation the first and<br>
second position may be translated along the top panel and<br>
the bottom panel respectively the same amount. The<br>
relevant distance will then be the geometrical distance<br>
between the second position to the top panel added to the<br>
relative displacement of the first position compared to<br>
the second position. This relevant distance should be<br>
equal to the arc length of the locking member. It is also<br>
possible that the first position is in the upper left<br>
corner and the second position is in the lower left<br>
corner. In such a design a portion of the locking member<br>
will extend along or at a point abut the top panel. This<br>
additional portion will form an imaginary first position<br>
and the relevant distance will be defined as above. It is<br>
also possible that the first position is located at a<br>
first distance from the upper left corner along the<br>
second side panel. The locking member will also in this<br>
case have a portion that extends towards and abuts the<br>
top panel thus forming an imaginary first position.<br>
Thus, the above-mentioned features of the invention<br>
disclose a basic design, which may be adapted in numerous<br>
ways to allow flat-laying of the package. It should be<br>
noted that the locking member rhus formed will<br>
automatically be erected when the flat-laid package is<br>
erected into a rectangular sleeve. The geometrical<br>
constraints will force the locking member to adopt the<br>
desired position as described above.<br>
If the locking member is formed by a separate<br>
member, the first position may be significantly displaced<br>
along the top panel in respect of the first aspect of the<br>
invention. However, in any case the first and second<br>
distance is correlated to a given, associated corner and<br>
said distances are along a panel folded about said<br>
corner. Thus, a locking element having one or both of the<br>
first and second positions displaced a distance from the<br>
associated ccrner will display essentially the same<br>
pattern of movement as a locking member having the first<br>
and second positions located at said corners.<br>
The locking member may also be formed of a cut-out<br>
in one of the panels forming the walls of the package.<br>
Such a cut-out will be folded inwardly into the package<br>
and fastened to another one of the side walls as<br>
described above. The locking member may e.g. be formed by<br>
a cut-out in the top panel; the cut-out being formed by<br>
two cuts from a side panel and a cut joining said two<br>
cuts at a central portion of the top panel. The locking<br>
member thus formed may be folded about a geometrical line<br>
extending between the two cuts from the side panels and<br>
being parallel to the fold lines between the panels. The<br>
geometrical line may be located in a corner of the<br>
package or at a giver distance from the corner. By<br>
folding the cut-out into the cross-section and fasten it<br>
to another panel this will result in a locking member in<br>
the same manner as the one being formed by a separate<br>
member or by a portion added to the blank. This will<br>
however, result in portion of the package being provided<br>
with an opening, which may be covered by another panel.<br>
If the cut-out is formed in a reinforcement panel located<br>
inside another outer panel, the cut-out locking member<br>
may be formed without getting any undesired openings into<br>
the package.<br>
It should be noted that the rectangle might also be<br>
formed as a square having four sides with equal length.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
Preferably, the first inside corner and the second<br>
inside corner are located at two opposite edges of one of<br>
said panels. This way a change in geometry when flat-<br>
laying/erecting the package will impart a change in<br>
distances experienced by the locking member compared to<br>
the change in distances by the sleeve as such. If they<br>
are located in or at a given distance from said corners<br>
the folding of the package about said corners will impart<br>
said difference in experienced distances.<br>
Preferably, the bottom panel and the first side<br>
panel are foldable in relation to each other about a<br>
first fold line forming a hinge between the bottom panel<br>
and the first side panel, the first side panel and the<br>
top panel are foldable in relation to each other about a<br>
second fold line forming a hinge between the first side<br>
panel and the top panel, the top panel and the second<br>
side panel are foldable in relation to each other about a<br>
third fold line forming a hinge between the top panel and<br>
the second side panel, and wherein the second side panel<br>
and the bottom panel are foldable in relation to each<br>
other about a fourth fold line forming a hinge between<br>
the second side panel and the bottom panel. This way the<br>
package may easily be flat-laid. It also makes it<br>
possible to form the package from a blank folded about<br>
said fold lines.<br>
Preferably, the sleeve is collapsible by<br>
simultaneous folding of the side panels in one and the<br>
same folding direction about the first and third fold<br>
lines, respectively, in relation to the bottom panel such<br>
that the second side panel is folded towards the bottom<br>
panel, and wherein said first inside corner of the<br>
rectangle is defined by the top panel and the second side<br>
panel.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention the first<br>
inside corner of the rectangle is defined by the top<br>
panel and the second side panel and the second inside<br>
corner is defined by the second side panel and the bottom<br>
panel. This forms the basis of forming the locking member<br>
at one side of the cross-section. This also forms the<br>
basis of forming the locking member having a significant<br>
extension into the cross-section, thus forming a highly<br>
reliable locking function.<br>
Preferably, the locking member comprises a first<br>
portion and a second portion adapted to form an<br>
essentially arcuate extension into said cross-section<br>
from said second position to said first position being<br>
located at a first distance from said first inside corner<br>
along the top panel. This further improves the above<br>
mentioned advantage concerning reliable locking function.<br>
The locking member may be formed as a broken or curved<br>
arch extending from a first position a first distance<br>
from an upper left corner along the top panel to a second<br>
position in a lower left corner. When the package is<br>
flat-laid the locking member will collapse further into<br>
the cross-section.<br>
Preferably, the first and second portion are<br>
interconnected along a fold line parallel with said<br>
normal to said rectangle, and wherein a distance from the<br>
first position to the second position along the top panel<br>
and the second side panel essentially coincide with a<br>
distance from the first position to the second position<br>
along the first and second portions of the locking<br>
member. This way the locking member will allow flat-<br>
laying of the package without forming any obstacle.<br>
Preferably, the first portion is adapted extend from<br>
said second position such that a geometric component<br>
along the bottom panel extends past the first position.<br>
This way it is secured that the locking member will<br>
continue to collapse into said cross-section when the<br>
package is flat-laid.<br>
Preferably, the locking member further comprises a<br>
third portion adapted to extend from said first position<br>
located at said first inner side corner along an inside<br>
surface of the top panel to the second portion, wherein<br>
the second and third portions are interconnected along a<br>
fold line parallel with said normal to said rectangle.<br>
This way it is easy to form the locking member as an<br>
integral part of the other panels of the package and<br>
still have a continuous outer surface of the sleeve.<br>
Preferably, a distance from the first position to<br>
the fold line between the second and third portion along<br>
the second side panel and the third portion essentially<br>
coincide with a distance from the fold line between the<br>
second and third portions to the second position along<br>
the first and second portions of the locking member. As<br>
mentioned above this will give a situation where the<br>
additional, third portion of the locking member will<br>
together with the second portion form an imaginary first<br>
position at the fold line between the third and second<br>
portion and the relevant distance will be defined as<br>
above. The relevant distances to compare could also be<br>
defined as the distance along the second side panel<br>
together with the length of the third portion of the<br>
locking member compared to the distance or arc length of<br>
the locking member.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention said first<br>
inside corner of the rectangle is defined by the top<br>
panel and the second side panel and the second inside<br>
corner of the rectangle is defined by the top panel and<br>
the first side panel. With this design a V-shaped or arc-<br>
shaped locking member will extend from one side to the<br>
other side of the cross-section of the sleeve. This will<br>
present a symmetrical solution, which will give good<br>
alignment properties when it comes to insertion and<br>
removal of the insert. It also gives a high degree of<br>
design freedom when it comes to designing the insert.<br>
Preferably, a first geometric distance is defined between<br>
said first position and said second position when the<br>
sleeve is erected and has a cross-section essentially<br>
formed as a rectangle and a second geometric distance is<br>
defined between said first position and said second<br>
position when the sleeve is collapsed such that the<br>
second side panel is folded against the bottom panel,<br>
wherein the second geometric distance is larger than said<br>
first geometric distance, and wherein the locking member<br>
has a length exceeding said first geometric distance and<br>
essentially coinciding with said second geometric<br>
distance. This way, the locking member will be forced to<br>
extend into said cress-section when the package is<br>
erected, i.e. has a rectangular cross-section, and it<br>
will be formed flat along the top panel when the package<br>
is flat-laid.<br>
Preferably, the second side panel comprises a first<br>
side panel portion connected to the botrom panel and a<br>
second side panel portion connected to rhe top panel,<br>
whereby an outer surface of the first portion abuts and<br>
is attached to an inner surface of the second portion.<br>
This way it is easy to design a blank for the complete<br>
forming of the package. Moreover, the above discussed<br>
placement of the first corner compared to the divided<br>
side panel will give an additional benefit when it comes<br>
to flat-laying packages as such. A package with a side<br>
panel of this kind allows without obstacles a flat-laying<br>
where the corner or fold line between the outer side<br>
panel (the first portion) and the top panel is opened or<br>
un-foided such that the first portion and the top panel<br>
forms a continuous surface. If the first and second<br>
portion was arranged in the opposite way, i.e. the first<br>
portion outside the second portion, the first corner<br>
should be redefined to be the corner between the bottom<br>
panel and the first portion. A package folded the other<br>
way around will experience buckling of the panels or<br>
demand differences in panel lengths.<br>
Preferably, the locking member is integrally formed<br>
with said first portion of the second side panel, thereby<br>
allowing the package to be formed from a single blank.<br>
The above object has in accordance with the<br>
invention also been achieved with a blank of the kind<br>
being defined by the introductory part of the application<br>
and further defined by the characterising features that<br>
the blank further comprises a locking member extending<br>
from said first portion of the second side panel in a<br>
direction being perpendicular to said first, second,<br>
third and fourth fold lines, that the locking member and<br>
the first portion of the second side panel are foldable<br>
in relation to each other about a fifth fold line forming<br>
a hinge between said first portion and the locking<br>
member, that the fourth fold line and fifth fold line are<br>
parallel with each other and between them define said<br>
first portion, and that the locking member comprises a<br>
fastening panel being adapted to be fastened to an inside<br>
surface of the bottom panel or the first side panel, or<br>
that the blank further comprises a locking member and a<br>
reinforcement panel, that the top panel and reinforcement<br>
panel are foldable in relation to each other about a<br>
sixth fold line forming a hinge between the top panel and<br>
the reinforcement panel, that the sixth fold line is<br>
perpendicular to said first, second, third and fourth<br>
fold lines, that the locking member extends from said<br>
reinforcement panel in a direction being perpendicular to<br>
said first, second, third and fourth fold lines, that the<br>
locking member and the reinforcement panel are foldable<br>
in relation to each other about a seventh fold line<br>
forming a hinge between said reinforcement panel and the<br>
locking member, that the seventh fold line is parallel<br>
with said first, second, third and fourth fold lines, and<br>
that the locking member comprises a fastening panel being<br>
adapted to be fastened to an inside surface of the bottom<br>
panel or the first side panel.<br>
It has in respect of the package been discussed<br>
several advantages with the design of the locking member<br>
and the design of the package as such. The above defined<br>
blank discloses the arrangement of the panels in respect<br>
of each other and it also defines the configuration of<br>
the locking member in relation to the different panels.<br>
If the blank is provided with a reinforcement panel this<br>
panel is adapted to be folded to the inside of the top<br>
panel and thus place the locking member (if the<br>
reinforcement panel carries the locking member) in<br>
essentially the same position as the locking member would<br>
have been placed in if it was placed directly on the<br>
first portion of the second side panel. The blank may be<br>
provided with a reinforcement panel and the locking<br>
member being carried by said first portion of the second<br>
side panel.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the locking<br>
member is integrally formed with said first portion of<br>
the second side panel. This way the basic design does not<br>
need to be changed dependent upon the introduction of the<br>
reinforcement panel or not. Moreover, this gives also a<br>
flexibility to change the exact location of the first<br>
position along the second side panel.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the locking<br>
member is integrally formed with said reinforcement<br>
panel. This way the position of the first position along<br>
the top panel may be defined by changing the position of<br>
the fold line between the reinforcement panel and the<br>
locking member.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the locking<br>
member is provided with an eighth fold line parallel with<br>
said fifth or seventh fold line, and wherein a sum of a<br>
distance between the eighth fold line and the fastening<br>
panel along the locking member and a distance between the<br>
fourth fold line and a designated fastening point of the<br>
fastening panel on the bottom panel is equal to a sum of<br>
a distance between the fourth and third fold lines as the<br>
blank is formed into a package and a distance between<br>
said fifth or seventh fold line and the eighth fold line.<br>
This will result in the continuous or broken arch shaped<br>
locking member located in the proximity of the second<br>
side panel.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a first<br>
geometric distance defined between the fifth fold line<br>
and the fastening panel is larger than or equal to a<br>
second distance defined between the second and the third<br>
fold lines. This will result in the flattened V-shaped<br>
bridge extending across the entire width of the cross-<br>
section. If the distance between the fifth fold line and<br>
the fastening panel is equal to the second distance<br>
defined between the second and the third fold lines, the<br>
locking member will extend as a V-shaped or arcuate<br>
bridge due to the change in relative length experienced<br>
by the locking member compared to the top panel due to<br>
the flat-laying and erection of the package. If the<br>
locking member is larger than said second distance it<br>
will extend as V-shaped or arcuate bridge also due to the<br>
change in relative length experienced by the locking<br>
member compared to the top panel due to the flat-laying<br>
and erection of the package. If the locking member is<br>
significantly larger than said second distance, this can<br>
be compensated for by moving the fastening points of the<br>
locking member at the different sides of the package in<br>
relation to each other.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
In the detailed description below two embodiments<br>
will be disclosed in detail. Corresponding features will<br>
be referred to by the same reference numerals in respect<br>
of both embodiments.<br>
As shown in fig 1 and fig 8, a sleeve 1 is adapted<br>
to receive an insert 2. The insert 2 may be removed from<br>
the sleeve 1 by a sliding motion in a sliding direction<br>
N. The sleeve 1 forms a rectangular cross-section and the<br>
sliding direction N is directed along a normal this<br>
rectangle. If the insert 2 is pulled outwardly from the<br>
sleeve 1 along the sliding direction N a locking function<br>
will prevent the insert 2 from being pulled out. The user<br>
must push a button 3 before the insert 2 is released.<br>
Moreover, if the user starts pulling the insert 2 out of<br>
the sleeve 1 before the button 3 is pushed, it will not<br>
help pushing the button 3, since the locking function in<br>
that case has reached a non-openable state. Thus, the<br>
button 3 must first be pushed to release the locking<br>
function and then the insert 2 may be pulled out of the<br>
sleeve 1. The details of this locking function will be<br>
disclosed below.<br>
Fig 2 and fig 9 discloses two blanks for forming two<br>
packages or sleeves 1 according to said two basic<br>
embodiments. The panels will be denoted with the<br>
reference numerals A-K. Panel A is also denoted bottom<br>
panel. Panel B is also denoted first side panel. Panel C<br>
is also denoted top panel. Panel D is also denoted first<br>
portion of a second side panel. Panel E is also denoted a<br>
second portion of the second side panel. Panel F is also<br>
denoted reinforcement panel.<br>
The panels A-F are foldable in relation to each<br>
other along a number of fold lines L1-L4 and L6. These<br>
fold lines are also denoted first to fourth fold lines<br>
and sixth fold line.<br>
Panel A and panel B are foldable in relation to each<br>
other about fold line LI forming a hinge between the<br>
panel A and panel B. Similarly, panel B and C are<br>
connected to each other along fold line L2, panel C and E<br>
along fold line L3, panel A and D along fold line L4 and<br>
panel C and F along fold line L6.<br>
The blank is formed from a paperbased packaging<br>
material. The packaging material may be provided with a<br>
polymer coating. This coating will make the material more<br>
tear-resistant and more resistant to handling by a user<br>
and it will aid in giving the packaging material a<br>
spring-back function. The fold lines are formed by a<br>
creasing operation, which is well known in the art and<br>
will not be described in detail. In an embodiment the<br>
insert 2 is formed from a similar material. As will be<br>
described later the spring-back function is a relevant<br>
feature especially when it comes to designing the insert<br>
2. The package and/or the insert may also be formed by a<br>
polymer-based material. Such a polymer material may be<br>
formed in one or several layers of the same polymer<br>
material or different polymer materials.<br>
The panels A-F will be folded along said fold lines<br>
L1-L4, and L6 and form a sleeve 1 having a rectangular<br>
cross-section. Panel F will initially be folded and<br>
adhesively be attached to panel C such that panel F will<br>
be located inside the sleeve 1. The reinforcement panel F<br>
may cover the inside of the top panel C completely or<br>
partly. In the figures, showing the sleeve 1, panel F has<br>
been left out in order to make the drawings clear. Panels<br>
H-K will also be folded along fold lines as shown in<br>
fig 2 and fig 9. First, panels I and K will be folded<br>
inwardly and then panel J or H will be folded onto panels<br>
I and K and then the remaining panel H or J will be<br>
folded to finalise the formation of an end wall of the<br>
sleeve 1.<br>
As can be noted in fig 2 and fig 9 the blank is not<br>
provided with any panels adapted to form a front wail of<br>
the sleeve 1. The insert 2 is provided with two panels 2a<br>
and 2b adapted to be folded onto each other about two<br>
fold lines separated by a third panel 2c. This third<br>
panel 2c is adapted to form the missing end wall of the<br>
package 1.<br>
The two blanks are also provided with a panel G<br>
adapted to be folded about a fold line L9 into the sleeve<br>
1. The insert 2 is provided with a corresponding panel 2d<br>
adapted to be refolded backwardiy when the insert 2 is<br>
inserted in the sleeve 1. When the insert 2 is pulled<br>
outwardly from the sleeve 1, panel 2d will follow the<br>
bottom panel A of the sleeve 1 and enter into the angle<br>
formed by the bottom panel A and panel G. When the panel<br>
2d hits fold line L9 it need to be unfolded to allow-<br>
further removal of the insert 2 from the sleeve 1, but<br>
since the two panels 2d and G both have an extension<br>
perpendicular to their respective fold lines being larger<br>
than the height of the sleeve 1 they cannot be unfolded<br>
by just pulling the insert 2 outwardly. Thus, the insert<br>
2 is prevented from being removed completely from the<br>
sleeve 1.<br>
The top panel C is provided with a cut-out 3a shaped<br>
as an oval. The portion of panel C within the cut-out 3a<br>
will when pushed be folded into the sleeve 1 along a fold<br>
line 3b (creased or imaginary) extending between the ends<br>
3c and 3d of the cut-out. Panel F is provided with a<br>
complete cut-out forming an opening 4 allowing the thus<br>
shaped push-button 3 enter into the sleeve 1.<br>
As shown in fig 1-2 and fig 8-9, the blank is<br>
provided with cut-outs 5 and 6 between panel C and F and<br>
between panel A and G. These cut-outs will form grip-<br>
openings of the sleeve 1 making it possible to pull the<br>
insert 2 out of the sleeve 2 with simple finger-grip.<br>
In accordance with a first basic embodiment, the<br>
blank and thus also the sleeve 1 is provided with a<br>
locking member 7 attached to panel D. As shown in fig 2,<br>
the locking member 7 may also be attached to the<br>
reinforcement panel F. It should also be noted that it<br>
may be formed as a separate member attached directly to<br>
the top and bottom panels as will discussed in detail<br>
below.<br>
The locking member is divided into four panels 7a-d<br>
divided by three fold lines 7e-g. The locking member 7 is<br>
connected to panel D along a fold line L5, also denoted<br>
fifth fold line. In the alternative, the locking member 7<br>
is connected to reinforcement panel F along a fold line<br>
L7, also denoted seventh fold line.<br>
Fig 5-7 shows that panel 7d, also denoted fastening<br>
panel, is fastened to the bottom panel C such that the<br>
fold line 7g will follow fold line L3 between the bottom<br>
panel C and panel E.<br>
When the blank is formed as a rectangular sleeve 2,<br>
the locking member will extend as a broken arch into the<br>
sleeve 1. The distance between corner lb to corner la and<br>
from corner la to fold line 7e, also denoted eighth fold<br>
line L8, is compared to the distance from fold line 7e to<br>
fold line 7f and from fold line 7f to corner lb. If the<br>
two distances are equal to each other the locking member<br>
7 can collapse and allow the sleeve 1 to be flat-laid.<br>
The panel 7a has an extension such that fold line 7f is<br>
located further into the cross-section than the point<br>
where fold line 7e, L8 is located. The panel 7c is not<br>
fastened to the inside of the top panel C. The panel 7c<br>
could according to an alternative embodiment be separated<br>
from panel D and instead be fastened to the inside of the<br>
top panel C. The point 7b from which the locking member 7<br>
extends in an arc is also denoted first position. As<br>
shown in fig 2 the first position 7b is located a<br>
distance d1 from the first corner la. It has also been<br>
discussed above that the first point 7b and the second<br>
point 7g, also denoted second position, may be translated<br>
along the top panel C and the bottom panel A such that<br>
the second position also is displaced a distance d2 from<br>
the second corner lb. It is also discussed above that the<br>
first position could be considered to be the connection<br>
of the locking member 7 to the panel D. Panel 7a is also<br>
denoted first portion, panel 7b is also denoted second<br>
portion and panel 7c is also denoted third portion of the<br>
locking member 7.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the locking<br>
member 7 is provided with an additional fold line 7e' as<br>
disclosed in fig 15. In fig 15, only a limited number of<br>
reference numerals are noted down, since the blank<br>
corresponds to the blank in fig 2 with a slight<br>
difference when it comes to the design of the locking<br>
member 7. The additional fold line 7e' extends close to<br>
and in parallel with fold line 7e. The two fold lines 7e<br>
and 7e' could also be formed as a single fold line having<br>
an transverse extension (across its longitudinal<br>
extension) corresponding to the two fold lines 7e and<br>
7e' . With the extended or double fold line it is possible<br>
to form the locking member 7 such that the arcuate<br>
extension is optimised with respect to the locking<br>
function and still may be completely flat-laid. One of<br>
the fold lines 7e, 7e' is located at the location which<br>
will fulfil the above discussed distance relationships<br>
such that the locking member 7 may be flat-laid and the<br>
other fold line 7e', 7e is located such that the locking<br>
member 7 will extend into the cross-section in the<br>
desired or optimised manner. If the location of the fold<br>
line 7e giving the flat-laying possibility results in a<br>
satisfactory extension of the locking member 7 into the<br>
cross-section when the package is erected it is<br>
sufficient to use only one fold line 7e as disclosed in<br>
the embodiment of fig 2. Of course the additional or<br>
transversely extended fold line 7e, 7e' may be used when<br>
the locking member 7 is formed as a separate member, an<br>
extension of the side panel portion D, as an extension of<br>
the reinforcement panel F, as a cut-out in the<br>
reinforcement panel F or as a cut-out in the top panel C.<br>
The insert 2 is provided with a locking tab 2e<br>
foldable in relation to the insert 2 along a fold line 2g<br>
(see fig 3 and fig 4). The trailing edge 2e' of the<br>
locking tab 2e and the angle of the folding line 2g are<br>
interrelated such that the leading edge 2e' ' will<br>
perpendicular to the sliding direction. The leading edge<br>
2e' of the locking tab 2e is formed as an arch in order<br>
to form a slanned surface abutting the locking member 7<br>
when the insert 2 is inserted into the sleeve 1. The<br>
slanted surface 2e will make the locking tab 2e be<br>
refolded more and more as the insert 2 is inserted into<br>
the sleeve 1, such that the locking tab 2e finally may<br>
pass behind the locking member 7 and spring-back behind<br>
it. This situation is shown in fig 7. The locking member<br>
7 is also provided with a slanted leading edge for<br>
facilitating insertion of the insert 2.<br>
In order to release the insert from the locking<br>
mechanism the push-button 3 is pushed into the sleeve 1<br>
and folds the locking tab 2e of the insert 2 to the basic<br>
plane of the insert 2 such that the locking tab 2e once<br>
again may pass the locking member 7. This situation is<br>
shown in fig 5.<br>
In accordance with a second basic embodiment, the<br>
blank and thus also the sleeve 1 is provided with a<br>
locking member 8. The locking member 8 is attached to the<br>
panel D along a fold line L5 also denoted fifth fold<br>
line. The locking member has two central panels 8a and 8b<br>
and a fastening panel 8c. The fastening panel 8c is<br>
adapted to be fastened to panel E as shown in fig 12 and<br>
fig 14. Panel 8c is connected to panel 8b along a fold<br>
line 8d. The distance between fold line L5 and the fold<br>
line 8d is larger than the distance between fold line L2<br>
and L3, i.e. the width of the top panel C. Thus, when the<br>
sleeve 1 is erected the locking member 8 is forced to<br>
form an arc-shaped extension into the cross-section of<br>
the sleeve 1 as shown in fig 13 and fig 14.<br>
In fig 14 the sleeve is flat-laid by translating the<br>
top surface C to the right in relation to the bottom<br>
surface A. This will result in that the geometrical line<br>
connecting fold line L3 with fold line L5 will rotate<br>
from being essentially 45° outwardly from the package to<br>
being essentially vertical. When considering the length<br>
of the locking member 8 and the top surface C, the<br>
available length of the top surface C will during this<br>
flat-laying be extended compared to the locking member 8<br>
an amount corresponding to the difference in translation<br>
between the fold lines L3 and L5.<br>
At the ccrner lb' being refolded the geometrical<br>
line connecting fold line 8d and fold line L2 will change<br>
from being directed essentially 45° outwardly to about<br>
horizontally. Thus, also at this corner will the outer<br>
move more than the member, but the difference is smaller<br>
compared to the difference at the opposite corner la.<br>
At the fold line being refolded (at corner lb') the<br>
change due to fold line relative displacement will be the<br>
fold line distance (distance after flat-laying) minus<br>
sin45° of the fold line distance (distance before flat-<br>
laying) in favour of the outer material. At the flat laid<br>
fold line (corner la) the change will be sin45° of the<br>
fold line distance (distance before flat-laying) minus<br>
zero (distance after flat-laying) in favour of the outer<br>
material. Thus, the available length will increase about<br>
sin45°-(l-sin45°), i.e. about 0.4 of the fold line<br>
distance. It should be noted that the fold line distance<br>
is in the same order as the material thickness.<br>
Geometrically the fold line distance is about squareroot<br>
of 2 times the material thickness. These phenomena will<br>
occur irrespective of the flat-laying direction.<br>
Moreover, since the upper left corner la will pivot<br>
about the left lower corner 1c being formed by the inner<br>
material of the left side D and the upper right corner<br>
1b' will pivot about the right lower corner Id being<br>
formed by the outer material B of the right side, the<br>
geometrical lever arms will make the inner left corner<br>
move less than the inner right corner and make the outer<br>
left corner move more than the outer right corner. Thus,<br>
the outer material will experience a geometrical<br>
extension compared to the inner material.<br>
Thus, these phenomena act together when the sleeve<br>
is collapsed in the way denoted by the arrows W in<br>
fig 14. The locking member 8 will allow flat-laying of<br>
the sleeve 1 if the additional distance between fold line<br>
8d and L5 compared to the width of the top panel C is<br>
equal the above described experienced lengthening of the<br>
top panel C.<br>
The locking member 8 is provided with two through-<br>
going openings 8e and 8f. Insert 2 according to the<br>
second embodiment is provided with two locking tabs 2e<br>
and 2f in the same manner as in the first embodiment. The<br>
locking tabs 2e and 2f are foldable about to fold lines<br>
2g and 2h. When the insert 2 is inserted into the sleeve<br>
1 the locking tabs 2e and 2f will spring-back into the<br>
openings 8e and 8f and prevent the insert 2 from being<br>
pulled out of the sleeve i.<br>
The locking tabs 2e and 2f are provided with two<br>
trailing edges 2e' and 2f. The openings 8e and 8f are<br>
each provided with a trailing edge 8e' and 8P slightly<br>
slanted from being perpendicular to the sliding direction<br>
N. The angle of the fold lines 2g and 2h, the angle of<br>
the trailing edges of the locking tabs 2e' and 2fr and<br>
the trailing edges 8e' and 8f of the openings 8e and 8f<br>
are chosen such that if a user starts pulling the insert<br>
2 out of the sleeve lr without pushing the button 3<br>
first, the locking tabs 2e and 2f will at least partly<br>
pass the trailing edges 8e' and 8f in the sliding<br>
direction. This results in that when the user push the<br>
button 3, the locking tabs 2e and 2f will not be allowed<br>
to be folded beneath the locking member 8. Thus, the user<br>
must push the insert back in again and then push the<br>
button before the insert 2 may be pulled out. Similarly,<br>
as in the first embodiment, the locking tabs 2e and 2f<br>
are provided with curved leading edges and the locking<br>
member is provided with a slanted leading edge. The<br>
locking function of the first embodiment may also be<br>
provided with this additional feature of forcing the user<br>
to push the button first. This is accomplished in the<br>
same manner as in the second embodiment, by slanting the<br>
trailing edge of the locking tab 2e compared to the<br>
trailing edge of the locking member. Fig 13 shows how the<br>
push-button 3 pushes the locking tabs 2e and 2f back<br>
through the openings 8e and 8f, thus allowing the insert<br>
2 to be pulled out of the sleeve 1.<br>
As discussed above the locking member 8 may be<br>
lowered in the cross-section by lowering the fold lines<br>
L5 and 8d in relation to the corners la and lb' along the<br>
distances d1 and d2. In order to further improve the<br>
experienced lengthening of the top panel C, fold line L5<br>
may be lowered slightly more than fold line 8d.<br>
As shown in the figures, the insert 2 may be formed<br>
as a so-called blister-pack carrying some kind of<br>
pharmaceuticals. It could however, be used to carry any<br>
kind of goods that you want to protect and perhaps make<br>
it difficult for kids to get access to. Thus, it could be<br>
used for razor blades, chemical substances or the like.<br>
The package could also be used for candy or other kind of<br>
small articles. The package offers the possibility to<br>
store such items in a child-proof manner. It is also<br>
beneficial to use such a package in order to keep small<br>
items within the package when the package is carried in a<br>
pocket or a purse. The locking function will prevent the<br>
package from being opened by mistake and will thus<br>
prevent chewing gums or throat pastilles from falling out<br>
of the package.<br>
It should also be noted that in the case of a<br>
reinforcement panel F being folded back an attached to<br>
the inside of the top panel C, the reinforcement panel F<br>
may be provided with a cut-out at the location where the<br>
locking member 7 otherwise would abut the reinforcement<br>
panel F. This way the locking member 7 will abut the top<br>
panel C even if there is a reinforcement panel F.<br>
Consequently, the space available for the locking member<br>
7 will not be affected by the presence of any<br>
reinforcement member F.<br>
It should also be noted that the package or blank<br>
might of course be provided with more than one locking<br>
member of the kind described above.<br>
Furthermore, it should also be noted that the<br>
designs disclosed in the above description only allow the<br>
package to be opened if the button is pushed to release<br>
the locking member before the insert is pulled outwardly<br>
at all. It is also contemplated to have the locking<br>
. member and locking tab formed with edges being<br>
perpendicular to the sliding direction and thus arrive in<br>
a design allowing the user to first pull the insert<br>
outwardly and thereafter push the button after realising<br>
that the insert is locked and still allowing the locking<br>
tab to pass the locking member. Other angles of the edges<br>
of the locking elements are also contemplated.<br>
