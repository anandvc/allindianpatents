				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]Natural gas is a clean-burning hydrocarbon fuel that produces less<br>
"greenhouse gases" upon total combustion than that produced from combustion<br>
of heavier hydrocarbons such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and coal. As a result,<br>
natural gas has been identified as an "environmentally friendly" fuel. In recent<br>
years, demand for natural gas has been outpacing wellhead supplies that are<br>
available for direct connection and delivery into the gas pipeline transport and<br>
distribution systems throughout the world, and particularly so within the United<br>
States and Europe. As a result, natural gas marketers, pipeline transporters,<br>
distributors and power utilities are turning to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to<br><br>
supplement their traditional natural gas supply. Pacific Rim demand for LNG is<br>
also increasing at a remarkable rate with accelerating LNG demand projected for<br>
Korea, Japan, China and India.<br>
[0006] LNG is immerging as an attractive alternative fuel for the transportation and<br>
vehicle fuel markets. New technology and government-sponsored programs have<br>
helped LNG to become a viable alternative to the more conventional forms of fuel.<br>
Both LNG and CNG are anticipated to capture a larger share of this market in the<br>
next decade displacing gasoline and diesel fuels.<br>
LNG is primarily liquefied methane containing varying quantities of ethane,<br>
propane and butanes with trace quantities of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbon<br>
components. When stored or transported at or near atmospheric pressure, LNG<br>
is a very cold liquid with temperatures ranging between -245°F to -265°F<br>
dependent upon its composition.<br>
[0007]Certain commercial quality specifications must be met when LNG enters<br>
the commercial marketplace. Natural gas pipeline and power utility companies,<br>
for example, specify in their commercial contracts that natural gas delivered into<br>
their facilities must comply with heating value or in some cases, Wobbie Index<br>
quality specifications as well as hydrocarbon dew point parameters. When LNG<br>
is distributed and used as fuel to power busses, fleet vehicles, private vehicles or<br>
other equipment, it must comply with certain quality specifications to assure the<br>
characteristics of the fuel yields clean, complete and total combustion in the<br>
customer's engine. LNG can also serve as a source of natural gas for making<br>
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) used in the fuels market and when this is the<br>
case, CNG quality specification will apply to the LNG.<br>
[0008] Some LNG sources contain more ethane and heavier hydrocarbons than<br>
others depending on the composition of the natural gas used in making the LNG.<br>
Depending upon the quantity of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons contained in<br>
the LNG, the LNG may have to be processed and conditioned to reduce the<br>
ethane and heavier hydrocarbon content in order to meet the specific commercial<br>
quality specifications for its use.<br><br>
[0009] From time to time, the liquid product price of ethane, propane, butanes and<br>
heavier hydrocarbon reflects a premium over that which would be realized if left in<br>
the LNG and sold at prevailing natural gas prices. Therefore, extraction of these<br>
products from LNG can be commercially attractive improving the overall revenue<br>
realization of the LNG source.<br>
[0010]Ethane and heavier hydrocarbons have for many years been extracted and<br>
recovered from raw natural gas produced from gas weiis and produced in<br>
association with crude oil production. Gas processing facilities of various designs<br>
and configurations including the application of turbo-expanders, mechanical<br>
refrigeration, iean oii absorption, adsorption using desiccants and combinations<br>
thereof have been used for this purpose. The most common prior technology for<br>
recovery of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons (NGL) from LNG is based upon the<br>
concept of pumping the LNG to high pressure, vaporizing the LNG and<br>
processing the resulting gas using traditional gas processing techniques with the<br>
conventional cryogenic turbo-expander and/or cryogenic J-T expansion processes<br>
being the most widely used. This practice does not capture and fully utilize the<br>
benefits of the cryogenic conditions available from the LNG.<br>
[0011]There are three other known processes for recovery of NGL from LNG that<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5114451, 5588308, and 6604380 that makes<br>
some use of the beneficial cryogenic conditions and properties of LNG.<br>
[0012] Patent 5114451 discloses a process for recovery of NGL from LNG where<br>
the LNG feed is warmed by cross exchange of heat from a warm gas stream<br>
being a recompressed overhead recycle stream from the fractionation unit<br>
(commonly referred to as a demethanizer). The NGL product is recovered as a<br>
liquid product from the bottom of the demethanizer. The send-out gas (the<br>
overhead vapor from the demethanizer), however, must be heated and<br>
compressed prior to delivery to the pipeline system. Compression and heating<br>
adds to the capital costs and fuel consumption of the process.<br>
[0013] Patent 5588308 discloses a process that recovers NGL by cooling and<br>
partial condensation of purified natural gas feed wherein a portion of the<br>
necessary feed cooling and condensation duty is provided by expansion and<br><br>
vaporization of condensed feed liquid after methane stripping, thereby yielding an<br>
NGL product in gaseous form. In the market place, NGL is sold and transported<br>
as a liquid product. Additional cooling and compression are required to make a<br>
liquid NGL product that adds to the capital cost and fuel consumption for making<br>
the final NGL product.<br>
[0014] Patent 6604380 discloses a process for recovery of NGL from LNG using a<br>
portion of the LNG feed, without heating or other treatment, as an external reflux<br>
during separation. A fractionation column is used in the process to recover an<br>
NGL liquid product from the bottom of the column with the overhead vapor<br>
product being the methane-rich residue gas which is subsequently compressed,<br>
re-liquefied, pumped, vaporized and sent to the receiving pipeline. This process,<br>
however, requires that the entire overhead vapor product stream from the<br>
fractionation column be compressed by a low head compressor in order to re-<br>
liquefy. The compression required for the process is a low head (75 to 115 psi),<br>
but requires the entire send-out gas stream to be compressed. If, for example,<br>
the facility is designed for a capacity to handle say 1,000 million standard cubic<br>
feet per day (MMscfd) of send-out gas, the compression brake horsepower (Bhp)<br>
could be on the order of 5 to 7 Bhp/MMscfd requiring a 5,000 Bhp to 7,000 Bhp<br>
compressor. This compressor and its associated fuel consumption add to the<br>
capital cost and operating expense for the facility.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] Development and optimization of new processing technology is the<br>
"cornerstone" for the continued growth and expansion of the LNG industry. The<br>
industry needs a more efficient process to extract and remove ethane and heavier<br>
hydrocarbons (NGL) from LNG. The disclosed system(s) and method(s) provide<br>
industry with a step forward in improving technology for efficiently extracting NGL<br>
products from LNG.<br>
[0016]The process disclosed reflects a significant improvement over prior patents<br>
and existing technology for the extraction of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons<br>
from LNG. The process of the disclosed embodiment(s) will reduce capital costs<br><br>
and improve fuel efficiency when compared to current practice from existing<br>
patented technology. The process of the embodiment(s) maximizes the utilization<br>
of the beneficial cryogenic thermal properties of the LNG using a unique<br>
arrangement of heat exchange equipment and processing parameters that<br>
essentially eliminates (or "greatly reduces) the need for gas compression<br>
equipment required in other patented technology of this field. Elimination or<br>
minimization of gas compression equipment minimizes the capital cost and<br>
minimizes fuel consumption or electrical power consumption, which reduces<br>
operating expenses. Use of our process in a facility designed to handle<br>
1,000 MMscfd of send-out gas will require only 150 to 550 horsepower of gas<br>
compression when processing LNG rich in ethane and heavier hydrocarbons. For<br>
leaner LNG compositions our gas compression horsepower increases, but still<br>
remains less than 1,000 horsepower for a 1,000 MMscfd send-out capacity which<br>
compares to the 5,000 to 7,000 horsepower required by the leading competitor<br>
process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6604380 referenced herein. Translating this<br>
comparison into economic terms, our process would result in a current-day capital<br>
cost savings ranging between $4.5 to $5.5 million and our fuel consumption<br>
savings would range between 335,000 to 480,000 MMBtus per annum based on<br>
a throughput capacity of 1,000 MMscfd. At current natural gas prices (assume<br>
$5,00/MMBtu average), our fuel expense savings would range between $1.7 to<br>
$2.4 million per annum.<br>
[0017]The disclosed embodiment(s) relate to a process for removing ethane<br>
and/or heavier hydrocarbons (NGL) from LNG at any facility receiving, storing,<br>
shipping, distributing, or vaporizing LNG. For purposes of this application, LNG<br>
containing more that 2.5 mole % and less than 25.0 mole % ethane and heavier<br>
hydrocarbons is defined to mean "Rich LNG". After extraction of ethane and/or<br>
heavier hydrocarbons, the residual methane-rich product after is defined to mean<br>
"Lean LNG". The ethane and/or heavier hydrocarbons extracted from the Rich<br>
LNG are defined to mean "NGL Product". Ethane and heavier hydrocarbons are<br>
referred to herein as "C2+". Propane and heavier hydrocarbons are referred to<br>
herein as "C3+".<br><br>
[0018]The disclosed embodiment(s) specifically relate to a process for extraction<br>
and removal of C2+ or C3+ from Rich LNG for one or more of the following<br>
purposes:<br>
a)	To condition Rich LNG so that send-out gas delivered from an LNG<br>
receiving and regasification terminal meets commercial natural gas quality<br>
specifications.<br>
b)	To condition Rich LNG to make Lean LNG that meets fuel quality<br>
specifications and standards required by LNG powered vehicles and other LNG<br>
fueled equipment.<br>
c)	To condition Rich LNG to make Lean LNG so that it can be used to make<br>
CNG meeting specifications and standards for commercial CNG fuel.<br>
d)	To recover ethane, propane and/or other hydrocarbons heavier than<br>
methane from Rich LNG for revenue enhancement, profit or other commercial<br>
reasons.<br>
[0019]Our process has the flexibility to either operate in a "high ethane extraction"<br>
or a "low ethane extraction" mode. When operating in the "high ethane extraction"<br>
mode, ethane recovery levels for our process ranges between 92% to 80% with<br>
propane recovery ranging between 99% and 90%. When operating in the "low<br>
ethane extraction" mode, ethane recovery is only 1% to 2% while propane<br>
recovery ranges between 95% to 80%. This feature of the process provides the<br>
flexibility to leave essentially all or any portion of the ethane in the Lean LNG<br>
stream if commercial specifications, pricing and other economic factors dictate the<br>
need for such operation.<br>
[0020]The disclosed embodiment(s) utilize several processing steps to extract<br>
and remove ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from Rich LNG that are disclosed<br>
in the Detailed Description section below. Briefly stated, low-pressure Rich LNG<br>
is pumped to processing pressure (380 psig to 550 psig), pre-heated, vaporized<br>
and fractionated in a refluxed cryogenic fractionation column equipped with one<br>
side reboiler and a main reboiler at the bottom. A split-stream of the pre-heated<br>
LNG liquid is used to provide cold reflux to the cryogenic fractionation column.<br>
The balance of the pre-heated LNG feed is vaporized and fed to the fractionation<br><br>
column as a vapor stream with entry into the column at 5 to 10 theoretical<br>
equilibrium stages below the top. The cryogenic fractionation column requires 15<br>
to 20 theoretical equilibrium stages and is designed to yield a liquid hydrocarbon<br>
product from the bottom and a cold methane-rich gas product from the top. The<br>
bottom liquid product is the NGL Product.<br>
[0021]Flexibility is embodied into our cryogenic fractionation column design to<br>
produce either a demethanized or a deethanized NGL Product. The operating<br>
parameters of the cryogenic fractionation column and associated equipment (i.e.<br>
operating pressure, feed temperatures, reflux/feed split, bottom temperature, etc.)<br>
may be adjusted and controlled within our process such that both the Lean LNG<br>
and NGL Product each conform to their respective commercial specification<br>
requirements.<br>
[0022]The cold gas product from the column overhead (lean in ethane and<br>
heavier hydrocarbons) is re-liquefied by cross exchange with the Rich LNG during<br>
the pre-heating step. This re-liquefied cold gas overhead product is the Lean<br>
LNG. Depending on the LNG composition, a small fraction of the cold gas<br>
product may not condense which is referred to herein as the "Tail Gas".<br>
[0023]A small cryogenic compressor is required to compress the Tail Gas that is<br>
not re-iiquefied by the cross exchange pre-heat step to gas pipeline send-out<br>
pressure. If the overall facility has a need for fuel gas, the Tail Gas can be used<br>
as a source of fuel, which reduces the amount of gas requiring compression. The<br>
volume of Tail Gas for our process is very small ranging between 0 to 5 mole% of<br>
the total gas throughput capacity when the Rich LNG feed composition contains<br>
more than 8 mole% C2+. Lower C2+ content in the Rich LNG feed ca<br>
Tail Gas fraction in our process to increase. For feeds containing only 2.5 mole%<br>
C2+, Tail Gas for our process would be as high as 7 to 10 mo!e% of the total gas<br>
throughput capacity.<br>
[0024]The Lean LNG is pumped to gas pipeline send-out pressure and the<br>
compressed Tail Gas is then recombined with the Lean LNG at send-out pressure<br>
(typically 1,000 to 1,100 psig but could be higher or lower). Upon mixing with the<br>
Lean LNG at send-out pressure, the compressed Tail Gas is absorbed and<br><br>
condenses into the liquid LNG phase. The resulting Lean LNG stream is then<br>
vaporized and heated for delivery into the natural gas pipeline.<br>
[0025] Process operating set points can be adjusted as required to make Lean<br>
LNG conforming with the quality specifications for gas pipeline market delivery, for<br>
use as LNG fuel in the LNG vehicle fuel market, or for use in making high<br>
pressure CNG fuel. When using this process for serving the LNG vehicle fuel<br>
market or any other local market requiring Lean LNG at or near atmospheric<br>
pressure, additional equipment is required to handle and re-liquefy flash gas that<br>
will evolve when the pressure of the Lean LNG is reduced down to atmospheric<br>
storage presure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0026]The disclosed embodiment(s) and their advantages will be beiter<br>
understood by referring to following drawing. Fig. 1 is a schematic flow diagram<br>
of one embodiment of this process.<br>
[0027] The drawing illustrates a specific embodiment for practicing this process.<br>
The drawing is not intended to exclude from the scope of the invention other<br>
embodiments that are the result of normal and expected modifications of the<br>
specific embodiment disclosed to accommodate the application and practice for<br>
compositions, commercial specifications, and operating conditions that may differ<br>
from that illustrated in the drawing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0028] One embodiment of this process is for conditioning Rich LNG so that send-<br>
out gas delivered from an LNG receiving and regasification terminal meets<br>
commercial natural gas quality specifications as illustrated in Fig.1. The following<br>
design description is based on a C2+ content in the Rich LNG feed ranging<br>
between 25.0 to 2.5 mole% operating in the "high ethane extraction" mode.<br>
Processing conditions reported are given as a range, reflecting the compositional<br>
range defined for this process.<br><br>
[0029]Stream 1 (Rich LNG from the LNG Storage Tanks) enters pump 2 (the In-<br>
Tank Pumps) where it is pumped to a pressure of approximately 100 psig<br>
discharging from the pump 2 as stream 3.<br>
[0030]Fig. 1 shows a portion of stream 3 being sent to the De-Super Heater<br>
Condenser system with a return back to stream 3. The Boil-Off Gas Compressor,<br>
Ship Vapor Return Compressor and De-Super Heater Condenser system shown<br>
in Fig. 1 are not claimed as an embodiment of this invention and therefore, are not<br>
discussed.<br>
[0031] Stream 3 is fed to pump 4 (the LP Sendout Pumps) where it is pumped and<br>
boosted to a processing pressure ranging between 380 to 550 psig discharging<br>
from the pump 4 as stream 5.'<br>
[0032] Stream 5 (the Rich LNG discharge from pump 4) is then fed to heat<br>
exchanger 6 (the LNG/Gas Exchanger) where it is heated to a temperature near<br>
its bubble point temperature and exits from the heat exchanger 6 as stream 7.<br>
The source of heat for heat exchanger 6 (the LNG/Gas Exchanger) is supplied by<br>
cross exchange with stream 13 being the overhead cold gas product stream from<br>
column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation Column). Heat exchanger 6 (the<br>
LNG/Gas Exchanger) performs dual services in that it heats stream 5 (the Rich<br>
LNG stream) up to near bubble point temperature (stream 7) and re-liquefies<br>
essentially all (100% to 90%) of stream 13 (the overhead cold gas product from<br>
the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) which exits as stream 14.<br>
[0033] Heat exchanger 6 (the LNG/Gas Exchanger) has a relatively large heat<br>
transfer duty and requires a small minimum approach temperature to achieve the<br>
efficiency required in this process. The design performance specification for heat<br>
exchanger 6 (the LNG/Gas Exchanger) requires a minimum approach<br>
temperature of approximately 3°F to 5°F between stream 13 and stream 7 to<br>
maximize the re-liquefaction of stream 14 exiting the exchanger. A shell and tube<br>
type exchanger could potentially be used for this service, but it would be quite<br>
large and relatively expensive. A more cost-effective design is achieved by using<br>
either a brazed aluminum plate-finned exchanger or a printed circuit type<br>
exchanger for this service.<br><br>
[0034] Stream 7 from heat exchanger 6 (the LNG/Gas Exchanger) is split into two<br>
streams (stream 8 and stream 9).<br>
[0035] Stream 8 serves as cold reflux to column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation<br>
Column) and is maintained within a range of 65% to 45% of the total flow rate of<br>
stream 7 using ratio flow control instrumentation. The flow rate ratio of stream 8<br>
to total flow of stream 7 is one of the parameters used in this process to control<br>
the level for ethane extraction and recovery from the Rich LNG. In general terms,<br>
biasing higher flow rates to stream 8 acts to increase ethane extraction from the<br>
Rich LNG while lowering flow rate ratio of stream 8 acts to reduce ethane<br>
extraction. Selection of the flow rate ratio set point for stream 8 is dependent<br>
upon the level of ethane extraction desired for the specific operating performance<br>
needed from the facility and the composition of the Rich,LNG.<br>
[0036] Stream 9 is fed to vaporizer 10 (the 1st Stage Vaporizer) where it is<br>
vaporized and heated creating stream 11, which is then fed to column 12 (the<br>
Cryogenic Fractionation Column). Stream 11 exiting from vaporizer 10 (the 1st<br>
Stage Vaporizer) is at a temperature ranging between 30 to 70°F and is<br>
essentially all vapor with no liquid. Stream 11 enters column 12 at an entry point<br>
located four to eight theoretical equilibrium stages below the top of the column 12.<br>
Vaporizer 10 (the 1st Stage Vaporizer) can be either an open rack vaporizer<br>
(ORV) using seawater as the warming fluid or a submerged combustion vaporizer<br>
(SCV) using gas-air combustion in a submerged water bath for heat or any other<br>
types of heater or exchanger combinations which might utilize process heat or<br>
waste heat available at the site. If a suitable source of seawater is available, the<br>
use of an open rack vaporizer is recommended which significantly improves the<br>
overall fuel efficiency of this process.<br>
[0037]Column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) is a reboiled fractionation<br>
column designed to yield an NGL Product from the bottom and a cold gas<br>
overhead product having a high methane content from the top. Column 12 (the<br>
Cryogenic Fractionation Column) is comprised of three sections and operates at a<br>
nominal pressure of 350 to 520 psig. The top section requires a larger diameter<br>
than the two bottom sections since the top section has a relatively high vapor<br><br>
loading of the combined column feed (stream 8 plus stream 11). Each section<br>
contains internal equipment (not shown) to achieve equilibrium stage heat and<br>
mass transfer as typically required in fractionation columns. The type of internals<br>
might include. bubble cap trays, sieve trays, dumped packing, or structured<br>
packing. For this service, either dumped packing or structured packing of suitable<br>
geometric design with appropriate liquid distributors and packing supports would<br>
likely provide better mass transfer for the cryogenic fluid traffic within the column-.<br>
Vendors and manufacturer specializing in fractionation column internals should be<br>
consulted to determine the optimum selection for the internals needed in this<br>
service.<br>
[0038] Process calculations indicate that a total of sixteen theoretical equilibrium<br>
stages are needed in column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) divided<br>
between the three sections of the column as follows: five theoretical stages in the<br>
top section, seven theoretical stages in the middle section and four theoretical<br>
stages in the bottom section. The total number of theoretical equilibrium stages,<br>
however, could range between fifteen to twenty stages depending upon the Rich .<br>
LNG composition and specific recovery performance needed. Variance in the<br>
actual design of column 12 will be required depending upon a number of factors<br>
including composition of the Rich LNG and the desire range of extraction levels<br>
for ethane, for example.<br>
[0039] Stream 8 is fed to the top of column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation<br>
Column) serving as cold liquid reflux to the column. Stream 8 liquid is uniformly<br>
distributed over the top packed section 12a by means of an internal distributor<br>
(not shown) and flows downward through the top section 12a wetting the packing<br>
internals and contacting the vapor traffic flowing upward. Stream 11, which is<br>
essentially all vapor, enters column 12 between the top section 12a and middle<br>
section 12b. The vapor of stream 11 combines with other vapor flowing upward<br>
from the middle packed section 12b of the column 12 and the combined vapors<br>
flow upward through the top packed section 12a contacting the cold liquid reflux<br>
which is flowing downward. The cold reflux liquid acts to absorb and condense<br>
ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from the vapor flowing upward through the top<br><br>
packed section 12a. Vapor from the top packed section 12a exits column 12 (the.<br>
Cryogenic Fractionation Column) as stream 13 (the overhead cold gas product).<br>
[0040] Liquid (if any) in stream 11 after entry into column 12, combines with the<br>
liquids flowing downward from the top packed section 12a and the combined<br>
liquids are evenly distributed over the middle packed section 12b by means of an<br>
internal distributor (not shown) located on top of the middle packed section 12b.<br>
The evenly distributed liquids continue flowing downward through the middle<br>
packed section 12b wetting the packing internals and contacting the vapors<br>
flowing upward. In so doing, a distillation operation is established within the<br>
column 12 with the lighter, more volatile components (i.e. methane and nitrogen)<br>
in the liquids being transferred into the vapor phase and the heavier less volatile<br>
components (i.e. ethane and heavier hydrocarbons) in the vapors being<br>
transferred into the liquid phase.<br>
[0041]At the bottom of the middle packed section 12b of column 12, a liquid<br>
draw-off tray (not shown) is required. Liquids leaving from the bottom of middle<br>
packed section 12b are collected in this draw-off tray and exit column 12 (the<br>
Cryogenic Fractionation Column) as stream 36. Exchanger 34 (the Side Reboiler)<br>
heats and partially vaporizes stream 36 that is then fed back to column 12 as<br>
stream 37 entering onto the liquid distributor (not shown) for the bottom packed<br>
section 12c.<br>
[0042]The liquids from this distributor are evenly distributed over the bottom<br>
packed section 12c and flow downward through the bottom packed section 12c<br>
wetting the packing internals and contacting the vapors flowing upward. In so<br>
doing, a distillation operation is again established within the column 12 with the<br>
lighter, more volatile components (i.e. nitrogen, methane and small amounts of<br>
ethane) in the liquids being transferred into the vapor phase and the heavier, less<br>
volatile components (i.e. ethane and heavier hydrocarbons) in the vapors being<br>
transferred into the liquid phase. The liquid from the bottom packed section 12c<br>
exit column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) as stream 26 and is fed to<br>
heat exchanger 27 (the Reboiler).<br><br>
[0043] Hear exchanger  (tne Reboller) neats and partially vaporizes stream 26.<br>
The vaporized portion of stream 26 from heat exchanger 27 (the Reboiler) is<br>
returned to column 12 (the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) as stream 28<br>
entering the column below the bottom packed section 12c of the column 12. The<br>
liquid portion of stream 26 exits heat exchanger 27 (the Reboiler) as stream 29<br>
(the NGL Product) and is sent to tank 30 (an optional NGL Product Surge Tank).<br>
[0044JTank 30 (which is optional) is a surge tank to hold an inventory of NGL<br>
product for feeding pump 32 and to provide operating flexibility. Stream 29, the<br>
NGL Product containing a mixture of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons and a<br>
small methane fraction (usually less than 1 mole % methane) exits from tank 30<br>
(the NGL Product Surge Tank) as stream 31 and is optionally pumped by pump<br>
32 (the NGL Booster Pumps) boosting the pressure approximately 50 psig<br>
discharging from the pump as stream 33. Depending on the specific application,<br>
alternate arrangement of storage and pumping may be utilized.<br>
[0045] Stream 33 is then cooled in heat exchanger 34 (the Side Reboiler) exiting<br>
as stream 35. Heat exchanger 34 (the Side Reboiler) performs a dual service and<br>
improves the fuel efficiency for the overall process. Thermal energy recovered<br>
from stream 33 is used to provide side reboiling heat as stream 37 into column 12<br>
(the Cryogenic Fractionation Column) between the middle 12b and bottom 12c<br>
packed sections and correspondingly, stream 35 (the NGL product stream) is<br>
cooled. Heat recovery from stream 33 in exchanger 34 (the Side Reboiler)<br>
reduces the heat load of exchanger 27 (the Reboiler) which in turn reduces the<br>
overall process utility heating requirement resulting in an overall reduction in the<br>
amount of fuel required to operate the system. The heat recovered from the NGL<br>
Product from exchanger 34 (the Side Reboiler) reduced the process utility heating<br>
system load by 15% to 35% when the C2+ content of the Rich LNG is high (C2+<br>
&gt;10 mole%). If the C2+ content of the Rich LNG is low (C2+ 
process utility heating system load is reduced by 2% to 15%. In certain design<br>
scenarios and marketing options, an auxiliary cooler may be required for cooling<br>
the NGL Product prior to shipping or storage. The auxiliary NGL Product cooler,<br><br>
which has not been shown in Fig. 1, would be located downstream of exchanger<br>
34 (the Side Reboiler) to cool stream 35.<br>
[0046]Stream 35 (the cooled NGL Product stream leaving the Side Reboiler) is<br>
then pumped to pipeline shipping pressure by pump 38 (the HP Shipping Pumps)<br>
metered and delivered into the NGL Product pipeline. Depending on the specific<br>
application, alternate arrangement of storage and pumping may be utilized. Other<br>
methods of transportation for movina the NGL product can be substituted for the<br>
pipeline transport method illustrated in Fig, 1 including, but not limited to truck, rail<br>
and marine (refrigerated cargo ships). Such alternatives would not require a HP<br>
Shipping Pump 38.<br>
[0047] Stream 14 being the re-liquefied "Lean" LNG exiting from heat exchanger 6<br>
(the LNG/Gas Exchanger) may contain a small fraction of uncondensed gas<br>
(0%to 10% on a molar basis) referred to as Tail Gas. Stream 14 is sent to tank<br>
15 (the LNG Flash Tank) to separate any uncondensed Tail Gas from the Lean<br>
LNG. Stream 20 (the Lean LNG) from tank 15 is pumped to pipeline send-out<br>
pressure by pump 21 (the HP Sendout Pumps) discharging from the pump 21 as<br>
stream 22.<br>
[0048]The uncondensed Tail Gas exits from tank 15 as stream 16 and stream 17.<br>
Stream 16 represents the portion of the uncondensed Tail Gas from tank 15 used<br>
as a source of high pressure fuel gas. Stream 17 represents the portion of<br>
uncondensed Tail Gas from tank 15 that is in excess of that used for high<br>
pressure fuel gas. Stream 17 (the Tail Gas) is compressed by compressor 18<br>
(the Tail Gas Compressor) to pipeline send-out pressure discharging from the<br>
compressor as stream 19. Under certain conditions depending on the<br>
composition of the reliquified LNG, stream 14 may be totally condensed and<br>
compressor 18 may not be required.<br>
[0049] Stream 19 (the compressed Tail Gas) is recombined with stream 22. The<br>
mixing of gas stream 19 (the compressed Tail Gas) with the liquid stream 22 (the<br>
Lean LNG at send-out pressure) causes stream 19 (the compressed Tail Gas) to<br>
be condensed and absorbed into the Lean LNG resulting in stream 23 which is<br>
100% liquid. Stream 23 (the Lean LNG containing the re-liquefied Tail Gas) is<br><br>
then vaporized in vaporizer 24 (the 2nd Stage Vaporizer) exiting as stream 25 (the<br>
pipeline send-out gas) which is then metered and delivered to the gas pipeline.<br>
Vaporizer 24 (the 2nd Stage Vaporizer) can be either an open rack vaporizer<br>
(ORV) using seawater as the warming fluid or a submerged combustion vaporizer<br>
(SCV) using gas-air combustion in a submerged water bath for heat or any other<br>
types of heater or exchanger combinations which utilize process heat or waste<br>
heat available at the site. if a suitabie source of seawater is available, the use of<br>
an open rack vaporizer (ORV) is recommended which significantly improves the<br>
overall fuel efficiency of this process.<br>
[0050J Example: One process embodiment as illustrated in Fig, 1 was modeled<br>
using a commercially available process simulation program called HYSYS<br>
(available from AspenTech of Calgary, Alberta Canada). HYSYS is commonly<br>
used by the oil and natural gas industry to evaluate and design process systems<br>
of this type. A wide range of LNG feed compositions were evaluated using the<br>
HYSYS model of our process. The HYSYS model calculation results for our<br>
process are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 below for one of the LNG feed<br>
compositions evaluated. The Example results given in Tables 1 and 2 are<br>
intended to illustrate performance of our process operating in the "High Ethane<br>
Recovery" mode for a typical LNG feed composition. Stream numbering in Tables<br>
1 and 2 coincide with those illustrated in Fig. 1. Any person trained and skilled in<br>
the technical art of process engineering, particularly one having the benefit of<br>
these disclosed embodiments, will recognize the possibility for variations to the<br>
process conditions disclosed in Tables 1 and 2 from application to application.<br>
For example, the combination of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates within<br>
our process will be different than that illustrated in Table 2 depending upon the<br>
LNG feed composition and flow rate, NGL product specification, send-out gas<br>
specifications, and desired recovery levels of the ethane and heavier<br>
hydrocarbons. The process disclosed by this patent is extremely flexible and has<br>
been confirmed by HYSYS modeling calculations to perform satisfactory over a<br>
wide range of LNG feed compositions, product specifications and desired<br>
recovery levels of C2+. The Example results given in Tables 1 and 2 shall not be<br><br><br><br><br><br>
