INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to new DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins produced by Bacillus thunngiensis strains. Particularly, new chimeric genes encoding a CrylC protein are provided which are useful to protect plants from insect damage. Also included herein are plant cells or plants, particularly rice plant cells or plants, comprising such genes and methods of making or using them, as well as plant cells or plants comprising a crylC chimeric gene and at least one other gene encoding an insecticidal protein, such as a chimeric gene encoding a CrylA protein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Strains and proteins derived from Bacillus thunngiensis (abbreviated herein as "Bt") are well known for their specific toxicity to insect pests, and they have been used since almost a century to control insect pests. Some transgenic plant species expressing Bt proteins are now available, and they successfully limit insect damage on plants. Despite the isolation of quite a number of insecticidal Bt proteins, only a few Bt proteins have been expressed in transgenic plants that have been commercialized, and this only in some crops.<br>
Insect pests are important constraints for rice production and occur in all rice growing environments. Insects reduce rice yields substantially and losses due to insects in Asia (excluding China) have been reported to be about 31.5 % (Heinrichs, 1994). Insect resistance in rice has been reported by expressing genes encoding insecticidal CrylAb or CrylAc proteins of Bacillus thunngiensis (e.g., Fujimoto et al., 1993; Wunn et al., 1996; Wu et al. 1997; Ghareyazie et al., 1997; Nayak et al., 1997; and Cheng et al., 1998) in rice plants. Toxicity of isolated Bacillus thunngiensis crystal proteins to some Lepidopteran rice insect pests has been evaluated for some proteins of the classes of Bt proteins CrylAa, CrylAb, CrylAc, CrylB, CrylC, CrylD, CrylE, CrylF, CrylG, and Cry2A (Karim et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1997), but several different forms of each of these protein classes exist (e.g., today about 14 different CrylC and about 20 different CrylAb forms have been reported in Crickmore et al. (1998) and in Crickmore et al. (2005)), and<br>
only one or a few of these were tested against rice insect pests. It is believed that no scientific publication describes the activity of the Cry1Ca4 protein to specific rice insect pests.<br>
Also, Strizhov et al. (1998) describe the design of a synthetic gene encoding a Cry1Ca5 protein. After analyzing and comparing with the known proteins (Cry1Ca1, 2, 3, and 4; on page 18, line 3 to page 19, line 6) they conclude that the sequence of the Cry1Ca5 protein differs by amino acid replacement A124E from the Cry1Ca4 protein. Strizhov et al. (1998) conclude that the occurrence of glutamic acid at position 124 in Cry1Ca4 was clearly due to an error. Strizhov et al. (1998) also believe that the then known CrylC sequences, including Cry1Ca4, contain critical errors with negative consequences either for function or stability of the CrylC protein, had a corresponding synthetic gene been designed on the basis of the known wild-type DNA sequences. Yet, the current inventors succeeded in producing useful synthetic crylC genes encoding an insecticidal CrylC protein having a glutamic acid (Glu) amino acid at position 124, and in obtaining plants resistant to insects using such genes.<br>
No rice plants containing a crylC gene are commercially available. Tang et al. (2006) describe the development of insect-resistant transgenic indica rice with a synthetic gene encoding a Cry1Ca5 protein, but do not disclose the DNA sequence of the gene. The gene used in Tang et al. (2006) is said to be 84 % identical to the native cry1Ca5 DNA, while the crylC coding sequence of this invention is 69.7 % identical to the native cry1Ca5 DNA of the same length when measured using the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm in EMBOSS with standard settings for the EDNAFULL matrix, and hence is quite different from the cry1Ca5 gene of Tang et al. (2006) (for the crylC DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1, the sequence identity with the same length native cry1Ca5 DNA is only 55 %, under the same settings). Also, the PCR primer set provided in Tang et al. (2006) will not allow detection of the crylC coding region of the invention, illustrating the clear difference between that gene and the crylC genes of the invention.<br>
Strizhov et al. (1996) report the expression of a cry1Ca5 gene in alfalfa and tobacco. Cao et al. (1999) and Zhao et al. (2003) have described transgenic broccoli plants expressing a Cry1Ca5 Bt toxin, as well as crosses with broccoli plants expressing a Cry 1 Ac toxin, so that both the Cry 1 Ac and Cry1Ca5 toxins are expressed in the same<br>
plants. The crylC coding sequence of this invention is only 78 % identical to the coding sequence of the synthetic cry1Ca5 gene of Strizhov et al. (1996, Genbank accession number X99103) when measured using the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm in EMBOSS with standard settings for the EDNAFULL matrix (the DNA of SEQ ID No. 1 only has 61.1 % sequence identity to the synthetic cry1Ca5 gene of Strizhov et al. using the same standard settings in EMBOSS).<br>
The current invention provides new synthetic genes encoding a protein derived from the Cry1Ca4 Bt protein, which can be combined with a gene encoding a Bt Cry protein, such as CrylAb protein, for expression in plants, particularly rice. The DNA sequence of the crylC genes of the invention do not occur in nature, and are different from any known DNA sequence.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the current invention, several new insect control genes encoding proteins derived from Bt are provided for use in plants. Specifically, such genes are useful in rice, particularly plants of the species Oryza sativa. The plants or seeds comprising at'least one of the new genes of the invention can be obtained by transformation of plant cells and production of plants or seeds therefrom comprising the genes of the invention. Also included herein are plants or seeds obtained by crossing a plant transformed to contain at least one of the genes of the invention with other plants, and by selection of those plants or seeds comprising the genes of the invention. Obviously, any plant species to be protected from insect species that are killed or controlled by the Bt proteins encoded by the novel genes of this invention can be transformed with the genes of the invention to obtain transgenic plants and seeds with increased resistance to such insects.<br>
Also, the current invention provides novel CrylC genes encoding an insecticidal protein comprising a functional plant intron in their coding sequence. The presence of the intron allows for high expression in plant cells, and at the same time secures that the gene does not express the insecticidal protein when' the gene is contained in a prokaryotic (micro)organism, such as during cloning steps.<br>
Also included in this invention is a DNA encoding a chloroplast transit peptide, particularly a DNA comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 372, particularly the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, is provided the use of a synthetic, codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding a Cry1 C protein or a protein comprising an insecticidal portion thereof, such as any insecticidal protein with at least 85 %, particularly at least 90 or 95 %, sequence identity to the protein of SEQ ID NO. 2 from amino acid position 28 to 627, with a glutamic acid at the amino acid position corresponding to position 124 in SEQ ID NO.2 (as can be determined using an amino acid sequence alignment), to control lepidopteran rice insect pests, particularly rice leaf folders or stem borers, as well as processes for controlling such insects comprising the step of transforming a plant with a chimeric gene comprising a plant-expressible promoter region operably-linked to such DNA sequence and sowing, planting or growing such plants in the field, or comprising the step of expressing such protein in plants, particularly rice plants.<br>
The current invention also provides a plant transformed with a crylC gene of the invention, which also comprises in its genome a DNA encoding a protein selected from the group consisting of: CrylAb. CrylB, CrylD, CrylE, CrylAa, CrylAc, Cryll, CryU, Cry2A, Cry6B, Cry9C, Cry3A, a VIP3A toxin, a protease inhibitor such as cowpea trypsin inhibitor, protease inhibitor II, or a cystatin (e.g., the protease inhibitors of Xu et al., 1996 or Duan et al., 1996), the GNA lectin, or an insecticidal protein from Xhenorhabdus, Serratia or Photorhabdus species strains (e.g., Waterfield et al., 2001; ffrench-Constant and Bowen, 2000)), or hybrid or fusion Bt Cry proteins such as a CrylA-hybrid toxin, e.g., the Cry1Ab-Cry1Ac fusion protein in rice event TT51 (Chinese patent application 200510062980, publication number 1840655) or the Cry1Ab/Cry1B fusion protein in Ho et al.

DESCRIPTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, a "nucleic acid sequence" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule in single or double stranded form, preferably a DNA molecule. An "isolated DNA", as used herein, refers to a DNA which is not naturally-occurring or no longer in the natural environment wherein it was originally present, e.g., a DNA coding sequence associated with other regulatory elements in a chimeric gene, a DNA transferred into another host cell, such as a plant cell, or an artificial, synthetic DNA sequence having a different nucleotide sequence compared to any known naturally-occurring DNA sequence.<br>
In accordance with this invention, nucleic acid sequences, particularly DNA sequences, encoding Bt Cry toxins or variants thereof have been constructed. The new DNA sequences are designated herein as crylC, and their encoded proteins are designated herein as CrylC (e.g., Cry1C1 or Cry1C2), proteins. Also a new DNA sequence encoding an optimized chloroplast transit peptide is provided herein, e.g., a DNA comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 371, particularly the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3.<br>
As used herein, the term "CrylC protein of the invention" refers to any insecticidal protein comprising the smallest fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 which retains insecticidal activity (hereinafter referred to as "smallest toxic fragment"), particularly any protein comprising an amino acid sequence with at least 99 % sequence identity to, or identical to, the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 28 to the amino acid at position 627 in SEQ ID No. 2, preferably any insecticidal protein comprising an amino acid sequence with at least 99 % sequence identity to, or identical to, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 from amino acid position 2 to amino acid position 627, particularly such proteins (or any CrylC protein, such as any insecticidal protein comprising at least 85 %, particularly at least 90 or 95 %, sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID No.2 from amino acid position 28 to 627) that contain a Glu amino acid at amino acid position 124 in SEQ ID No. 2, or at the equivalent position in a shorter or longer sequence (as can be determined in an amino acid sequence alignment). Also included in this definition is an insecticidal protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 from amino acid position 1 to amino acid position<br>
627, or comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 (named Cry1C1 protein herein), as well as an insecticidal protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 627, or comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 (also named Cry1C2 protein herein), as well as such insecticidal proteins wherein 1-5 amino acids have been deleted or replaced by other amino acids, without changing the Glu amino acid at amino acid position 124 in SEQ ID No. 2 or at an equivalent position in a shorter or longer protein.<br>
Also included herein as a CiylC protein of the invention are minor amino acid additions such as the insertion of an Ala or Asp amino acid between the first and second amino acid of a Cry1 C protein of the invention, to give Met Ala or Met Asp as first two amino acids, or the fusion of a CrylC protein of the invention to another protein or peptide, such as a transit peptide-Cryl C fusion protein.<br>
Since some changes to the CrylC amino acid sequence are possible without changing it's insecticidal activity (such as, e.g., the introduction of DNA restriction enzyme cleavage sites for manufacturing of the gene encoding the CrylC protein), also included in the invention as a CrylC protein as used herein is any protein comprising an equivalent of the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 28 to the amino acid at position 627 in SEQ ID No. 2, but wherein less than 10, preferably 1 to 5, amino acids are replaced by other amino acids in this region in SEQ ID No. 2, without negatively affecting the insecticidal activity of the protein. Preferably, the amino acid at position 124 in SEQ ID No. 2 or at position 247 in SEQ ID No. 5 (or at an equivalent position in a shorter or longer sequence) is glutamic acid (Glu) in such protein.<br>
Also useful in this invention are variants of the CrylC protein of SEQ ID No. 2 which comprise a sequence having a sequence identity of at least 95 %, particularly at least 96 %, 97 %, 98 % or at least 99 % at the amino acid sequence level with the region from the amino acid at position 28 to the amino acid at position 627 of SEQ ID No.2, as determined using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm in EMBOSS (Rice et al., 2000) to find optimum alignment over the entire length of the sequences, using default settings (gap opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty 0.5; for amino acid sequence comparisons, the EBLOSUM62 matrix is used). Preferred variants of the CrylC protein of the invention include a protein comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No.<br>
2 from amino acid position 28 to amino acid position 627, but wherein one, some or all of the following amino acids at the following positions compared to the positions in SEQ ID No. 2 are changed: the amino acid at position 183 is Valine, the amino acid at position 294 is Arginine, the amino acid at position 453 is Aspartic acid, or the amino acid at position 592 is Arginine. Particularly, variants of the CrylC protein of this invention have no more than 5 amino acid differences with the CrylC protein of SEQ ID No. 2 from amino acid position 28 to amino acid position 627, and retain the Glu amino acid at position 124 in SEQ ID No. 2 (or at an equivalent position in a shorter or longer sequence).<br>
A CrylC protein comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 28 to the amino acid at position 627 in SEQ ID No. 2 retains all or most of the insecticidal activity to its' target insects which are killed or who's growth is inhibited by the entire protein as produced by Bacillus thuringiensis in nature, and addition of amino acids or protein sequences at the N- or C-terminal part thereof does not disrupt this insecticidal activity. Hence, any protein characterized by an amino acid sequence containing or including this region is useful and forms part of this invention.<br>
The terminology DNA or protein "comprising" a certain sequence X, as used herein, refers to a DNA or protein including or containing at least the sequence X, so that other nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be included at the 5' (or N-terminal) and/or 3' (or C-terminal) end, e.g. (the nucleotide sequence of) a selectable marker protein as disclosed in EP 0 193 259, (the nucleotide sequence of) a transit peptide, and/or a 5' leader sequence or a 3" trailer sequence. Similarly, use of the term "comprise", "comprising" or "comprises" throughout the text and the claims of this application should be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, the "sequence identity" of two related nucleotide or amino acid sequences, expressed as a percentage, refers to the number of positions in the two optimally aligned sequences which have identical residues (x100) divided by the number of positions compared. A gap, i.e., a position in an alignment where a residue is present in one sequence but not in the other, is regarded as a position with non-identical residues. The alignment of the two sequences is performed by the Needleman and<br>
Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch 1970) in EMBOSS (Rice et al., 2000) to find optimum alignment over the entire length of the sequences, using default settings (gap opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty 0.5).<br>
The "smallest toxic fragment" of a CrylC protein of the invention, as used herein, is that smallest fragment or portion of a CrylC protein retaining insecticidal activity that can be obtained by enzymatic, such as trypsin or chymotrypsin, digestion of the full length Cry protein, or that smallest fragment or portion of a Cry protein retaining insecticidal activity that can be obtained by making nucleotide deletions in the DNA encoding a CrylC protein. Such smallest toxic fragment can also be obtained by treatment of a CrylC protein with insect gut juice, preferably midgut juice, from an insect species susceptible to (I.e., killed or otherwise negative affected in its growth or feeding by) such CrylC protein.<br>
As used herein, the terms ucry1C DNA" or "crylC gene", refer to any DNA sequence encoding the CrylC protein of the invention. This includes naturally occurring, artificial or synthetic DNA sequences encoding the CrylC protein of the invention, such as a DNA identical to or with at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99 % sequence identity to the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 from nucleotide position 82 to nucleotide position 2415, or to the DNA sequence or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 from nucleotide position 4 to 2415, or to the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1, or to the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 2784, or to the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 from nucleotide position 1 to nucleotide position 2784, or to the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 5. Also included herein are DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins which are similar enough to any one of the DNA sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 1 or 5 so that they can (i.e., have the ability to) hybridize to these DNA sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. "Stringent hybridization conditions", as used herein, refers particularly to the following conditions: immobilizing the relevant DNA sequences on a filter, and prehybridizing the filters for either 1 to 2 hours in 50 % formamide, 5 % SSPE, 2x Denhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 42 ° C, or 1 to 2 hours in 6x SSC, 2xDenhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 68 °C. The denatured dig- or radio- labeled probe is then added directly to the prehybridization fluid and incubation is carried out for 16 to 24 hours at the appropriate temperature mentioned above.  After incubation, the filters are<br>
then washed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 2x SSC, 0.1 % SDS, followed by 2 washes of 30 minutes each at 68 °C in 0.5 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS. An autoradiograph is established by exposing the filters for 24 to 48 hours to X-ray film (Kodak XAR-2 or equivalent) at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Of course, equivalent conditions and parameters can be used in this process while still retaining the desired stringent hybridization conditions.<br>
Also included herein as cry1C genes of the invention are DNA sequences encoding an insecticidal protein with at least 80 % or 90 %, preferably at least 93 to 97 %, particularly at least 95, at least 98 or at least 99 %, sequence identity to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 from nucleotide position 82 to nucleotide position 2415, or to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 from nucleotide position 4 to 2415, or to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1, or to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 5 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 2784, or to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 5, particularly a DNA encoding a CrylC protein comprising an amino acid sequence with,at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99 % sequence identity with the amino acid sequence from amino acid position 2 or 28 to the amino acid at position 627 in SEQ ID No. 2, or with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 or 5, particularly such CrylC protein wherein the amino acid at position 124 in SEQ ID No. 2 (or at an equivalent position in another sequence) is Glu. The DNA sequence identities referred to herein are calculated using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm in EMBOSS (Rice et al., 2000) to find optimum alignment over the entire length of the sequences, using default settings (gap opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty 0.5; for DNA sequence comparisons, the EDNAFULL matrix is used; for amino acid sequence comparisons, the EBLOSUM62 matrix is used).<br>

"Insecticidal activity" of a protein, as used herein, means the capacity of a proteih to kill insects, inhibit their growth or cause a reduction in insect feeding when such protein is ingested by insects. In this invention, such ingestion is preferably through ingestion of recombinant host cells, such as a plant cell, seed or plant, expressing a protein of the invention, by such insect It is understood that activity to insects of one insect species, preferably the larvae thereof, is sufficient for a protein to have insecticidal activity as used herein, although often insects of different insect species are affected by the proteins of the invention. The recombinant hosts expressing a CrylC protein of the invention are typically developed for or targeted to specific major insect pest species for a certain crop or region where such insect species is a pest, e.g., the Lepidopteran rice stem borers and leaf-folders which are insect pests on rice crops in China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand, but other insects can also be controlled by the recombinant hosts of the invention, such as by the<br>
transgenic plant cells or plants, e.g., the transgenic rice plant cells or plants of the invention comprising any one of the chimeric crylC genes of the invention.<br>
The plants of the invention containing a crylC gene of the invention allow new methods of agriculture to be used, wherein less or no insecticides are used on plants such as rice to control plant insect pests, such as rice stem borers or rice leaf-folders, and one embodiment of the invention hence includes use of the plants or plant cells of the invention, such as rice plants or plant cells, comprising a crylC gene of the invention to control plant pest insects, such as rice pest insects, particularly rice stem borers and rice leaf-folders, as well as methods of controlling plant insect pests, such as rice insect pests, e.g., rice stem borers and rice leaf-folders, by expressing the CrylC protein of the invention in plant cells, seeds or plants, particularly rice plant cells, seeds or plants, or by growing, sowing or cultivating plants, such as rice plants, comprising the crylC gene of the invention.<br>
"(lnsect-)controlling amounts" of or "control" by a CrylC protein, or by a recombinant host expressing a CrylC protein of this invention, as used herein, refers to an amount of protein which is sufficient to limit damage to a plant by insects feeding on such plant, e.g., by killing the insects or by inhibiting the insect development, fertility or growth In such a manner that an insect species provides less damage to a plant. This does not mean that treatment of plants with chemical insecticides will no longer be necessary (e.g., to control insect species not affected by the proteins of the invention, such as (secondary) Coleopteran or Dipteran insect pests), but that treatment by chemical insecticides for the insects targeted by the proteins of the invention can be significantly reduced or avoided, while still obtaining acceptable plant performance in the field and acceptable yield.<br>
The crylC genes of the invention are preferably used in rice cells, plants, or seeds to control rice insect pests. "Rice", as used herein, refers to a cereal grass of the genus Oryza which is cultivated for its edible grain, preferably Oryza sativa and Oryza glabemma, particularly Oryza sativa. "Rice grain", as used herein, includes brown or unpolished rice grain, polished or white rice grain, as well as steamed, fried or cooked, broken or parboiled grain as well as pre-germinated rice grain. Rice as used herein includes any manner of production or growing of rice, such as irrigated or non-irrigated<br>
rice, floating or deepwater rice, paddy rice, dry land rice, open pollinated or hybrid rice, and includes rice of the indica, japonica or javonica cultivars. Hybrid rice, particularly Arize™ hybrid rice, is a preferred embodiment of this invention, because of its' higher grain yield, and optimal grain and seed quality. Rice, when used herein generally, also refers to seeds, cells, protoplasts, pollen, or any parts or tissues of a rice plant.<br>
As used herein, "processed rice grain" refers to milled, polished, dehusked, parboiled, converted, broken, steamed, or cooked grain. Included herein as processed rice grain is also (partially) cooked or steamed brown rice, such as quick or instant brown rice, and any type of rice grain no longer containing a viable embryo that can grow into a rice plant.<br>
"Rice products", as used herein, refers to products containing or made from rice plants, seeds, cells or grain of the invention, including rice flour, noodles, porridge, beverages, rice dishes and the like.<br>
In accordance with this invention, insects susceptible to the CrylC proteins of the invention are contacted with these proteins in insect-controlling amounts, preferably insect-killing amounts. In one embodiment of this invention, recombinant hosts of the invention, such as transgenic plant cells or plants of the invention, express a protein or a combination of proteins of the invention at high levels, such that a "high dose" level is obtained. A "high dose level", "high dose insect resistance" or "high dose" expression, as used herein when referring to a recombinant plant cell or plant, refers to a concentration of the insecticidal protein in a plant cell or plant (measured by ELISA as a percentage of the total soluble protein, which total soluble protein is measured after extraction of soluble proteins in an extraction buffer (e.g., the extraction buffer described in Jansens et al., 1997) using Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA; Bradford, 1976)) which kills a developmental stage of the target insect which is significantly less susceptible, preferably at least 25 times less susceptible to the toxin than the first larval stage of the insect, and can thus can be expected to ensure full control of the target insect. In one embodiment this refers to the obtaining of at least 97 percent, preferably at least 99 percent, most preferably 100 percent, mortality for the fourth larval instar (for insects having 5 larval instars) or the last larval instar (for insects having 4 or less larval instars) of a target insect, as measured 10 to 14 days after insect infestation of such<br>
plant cells or plants, or parts thereof, in routine insect bioassays (using a normal susceptible insect colony (not insects selected for resistance to Bt proteins)), preferably whole plant insect bioassays, using suitable controls.<br>
The existence of one target insect species (i.e., an insect species, preferably the larvae thereof, which can cause significant damage to a plant species, and which is typically an Insect for which a transgenic plant is designed and developed) for which transformed plant cells or plants according to this invention provide a "high dose" level insect resistance is sufficient for a plant to be designated as giving "high dose" expression, in accordance with this invention.<br>
Preferred target insects for the plants and plant cells of this invention are economically damaging Lepidopteran Insect pests of plants that feed on or otherwise damage plants and thereby reduce plant yields (herein referred to as "Lepidopteran plant insect pests"), particularly Lepidopteran rice stem borers and rice leaf-folders, preferably insects selected from the group consisting of: the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis, the yellow stem borer Scirpophaga incertulas (also named Tryporyza incertulas), the white stem borer Scirpophaga innotata (also named Tryporyza innotata), the dark-headed stem borer Chilo polychrysa, the pink stem borer Sesamia inferens, the sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis, the rice stalk borer Chilo plejadellus, the rice leaffolder Marasmia patnalis, the rice leaffolder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and insects such as Hereitogramma licahsalis, Naranga aenescens, Mycalesis gotama, Marasmia exigua, Marasmia ruralis, Nymphula depunctalis, Spodoptera litura, Rupela albinella, Spodoptera frugiperda, Mythimna unipuncta, Chilo zacconius and Pamara guttata. Most particularly target insects for the CrylC plants, cells or seeds of this invention are rice insect pest species of the following genera: Chilo, Scirpophaga, Marasmia, Cnaphalocrocis, Diatraea, and Spodoptera, preferably Chilo suppressalis, Scirpophaga incertulas, Marasmia patnalis, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and Spodoptera litura insects. Obviously, in different countries or regions, different local names can be used for the insect of the same species.<br>
A "chimeric gene", as used herein, is used to refer to a DNA comprising at least two different DNA fragments (such as a promoter, a 5" untranslated leader, a coding region encoding a chloroplast transit peptide, a crylC coding region, an intron, a 3' untranslated<br>
trailer, and a 3' end transcript formation and polyadenylation region) which are operably-linked and which are not naturally associated with each other or which originate from different sources, preferably this term refers to a DNA comprising a plant-expressible promoter region operably-linked to a DNA sequence encoding a CrylC protein of this invention, such as the DNA or coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5.<br>
A "coding sequence" pr "coding region" as used herein, when referring to the crylC gene of the invention, refers to that DNA sequence encoding an amino acid sequence and excludes any 5' or 3' untranslated leader or trailer sequences, or untranslated sequences such as introns. Hence, the coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 is the DNA sequence from nucleotide position 1 to 590 in SEQ ID No. 1 linked to the DNA sequence from nucleotide position 1125 to 2415, which forms one continuous reading frame encoding one protein, not Interrupted by untranslated parts such as introns or stop codons. A coding sequence, as used herein, excludes a stop codon, but includes the (Met) translation start codon.<br>
The term "encoding", as used herein, like in the terminology "a gene or DNA encoding protein X", refers to the capacity of such gene to produce a protein upon transcription and translation of the coding sequence contained in such gene in a target host cell. Hence, the cry1C1 chimeric gene of the invention encodes the Cry1C1 protein of the invention, even though this chimeric gene contains two coding sequences (or exons) interrupted by a non-coding intron sequence.<br>
The DNAs encoding the CrylC proteins of the invention can be chemically synthesized using routine techniques, and can be inserted in expression vectors to produce high amounts of CrylC proteins. The CrylC proteins of the invention can be used to prepare specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a conventional manner (Hofte et al., 1988) to develop immuno-assays (e.g., ELISA, Western blotting, antibody-coated dipsticks) to detect the presence of absence of these proteins in any material, such as plant material.<br>
The tools developed to identify transgenic plant cells, plants, or plant-derived materials such as leaves, seeds, grain, or rice products comprising any one of the crylC genes of<br>
the invention, or DNA-containing products which comprise or are derived from plant material comprising a crylC gene of the invention are based on the specific sequence characteristics of the novel genes of the invention, such as, a specific restriction map of the genomic region comprising the introduced (foreign) crylC gene, or specific molecular markers based on the sequence of the foreign DNA integrated in the plant's genome.<br>
Once the sequence of a foreign DNA such as the crylC genes of the invention is known, primers and probes can be developed which specifically recognize these sequences in the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) of a sample by way of a molecular biological technique. For instance a PCR method can be developed to identify the genes of the invention in biological samples (such as samples of plants, plant material or products comprising plant material, such as rice grain or seed or rice products as defined herein). Such a PCR is based on at least two specific "primers", e.g., both recognizing a sequence within the crylC DNA or the crylC coding region of the invention (such as the DNA of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5, or the coding region of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5), or one recognizing a sequence within the crylC DNA and the other recognizing a sequence within the associated transit peptide sequence or within the regulatory regions such as the promoter or 3' end of the chimeric gene comprising a crylC DNA of the invention. The primers preferably have or comprise a sequence of between 15 and 35 nucleotides which under optimized PCR conditions specifically recognize a sequence within the crylC chimeric gene or coding region of the invention, so that a specific fragment ("integration fragment" or discriminating amplicon) is amplified from a nucleic acid sample comprising a crylC gene of the invention. This means that only the targeted integration fragment, and no other sequence in the plant genome or foreign DNA, is amplified under optimized PCR conditions.<br>
PCR primers suitable for the invention are oligonucleotides ranging in length from 17 nucleotides to about 200 nucleotides, comprising a nucleotide sequence of at least 17 consecutive nucleotides, preferably 20 consecutive nucleotides, selecteTffforri the crylC DNA or crylC chimeric gene sequence as transferred to plant cells or plants of the invention.<br>
The primers may of course be longer than the mentioned 17 consecutive nucleotides, and may, e.g., be 20, 21, 22, 30, 35, 50, 75, 100,150, 200 nt long or even longer. The primers may entirely consist of nucleotide sequences selected from the crylC nucleotide sequences. However, the nucleotide sequence of the primers at their 5' end (i.e., outside of the 3'-located 17 consecutive nucleotides) is less critical. Thus, the 5' sequence of the primers may consist of a nucleotide sequence selected from the crylC chimeric gene sequence, as appropriate, but may contain several (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10) mismatches. The 5' sequence of the primers may even entirely consist of a nucleotide sequence unrelated to the crylC genes of the invention, such as a nucleotide sequence representing one or more restriction enzyme recognition sites. Such unrelated sequences or flanking DNA sequences with mismatches should preferably be no longer than 100, more preferably no longer than 50 or no longer than 25 nucleotides.<br>
Moreover, suitable primers may comprise or consist of a nucleotide sequence at their 3' end spanning the joining region between the crylC coding sequence of the invention and the associated transit peptide sequence or the regulatory elements in the crylC chimeric gene integrated in the plant DNA, such as a promoter sequence, a leader sequence, a trailer sequence or a 3' transcript termination and polyadenylation sequence. It will also be immediately clear to the skilled artisan that properly selected PCR primer pairs should also not comprise sequences complementary to each other.<br>
The term "primer" as used herein encompasses any nucleic acid that is capable of priming the synthesis of a nascent nucleic acid in a template-dependent process, such as PCR. Typically, primers are oligonucleotides from 10 to 30 nucleotides, but longer sequences can be employed. Primers may be provided in double-stranded form, though the single-stranded form is preferred. Probes can be used as primers, but are designed to bind to the target DNA or RNA and need not be used in an amplification process.<br>
The term "recognizing" as used herein when referring to specific primers, refers to the fact that the specific primers specifically hybridize to a nucleic acid sequence in the crylC genes of the invention under a standard PCR identification protocol, whereby the<br>
specificity is determined by the presence of positive and negative controls as is well known in the art.<br>
Also included herein is a kit to detect the crylC genes of the invention in biological material, as well as the use of such kit to screen biological material. A "kit" as used herein refers to a set of reagents for the purpose of performing the identification of the crylC genes of the invention in biological samples. More particularly, a preferred embodiment of the kit of the invention comprises at least one or two specific primers, as described above. Optionally, the kit can further comprise any other reagent described herein in the PCR identification protocol. Alternatively, according to another embodiment of this invention, the kit can comprise a specific probe, as described above, which specifically hybridizes with nucleic acid of biological samples to identify the presence of the crylC genes therein. Optionally, the kit can further comprise any other reagent (such as but not limited to hybridizing buffer, label) for identification of the crylC genes in biological samples, using the specific probe.<br>
Standard PCR protocols are described in the art, such as in 'PCR Applications Manual" (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 2nd Edition, 1999). The optimal conditions for the PCR, including the sequence of the specific primers, is specified in a PCR identification protocol for each crylC gene-containing plant species. It is however understood that a number of parameters in the PCR identification protocol may need to be adjusted to specific laboratory conditions, and may be modified slightly to obtain similar results. For instance, use of a different method for preparation of DNA may require adjustment of, for instance, the amount of primers, polymerase and annealing conditions used. Similarly, the selection of other primers may dictate other optimal conditions for the PCR identification protocol. These adjustments will however be apparent to a person skilled in the art, and are furthermore detailed in current PCR application manuals such as the one cited above.<br>
Examples of suitable primer combinations in accordance with the invention for detecting the crylC DNA of the invention are a primer comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 7 (primer P1C203) and a primer comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 8 (primer<br>
P1C204). Hence, any DNA encoding an insecticidal CrylC protein which is specifically recognized by these primers is included in this invention, as well as any methods or any kits to detect such DNA using these or other specific primers. The primers P1C203 and P1C204, or primers comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 7 or 9, can also be used as probes for detecting the presence of a crylC gene of the invention.<br>
Also specific markers or labeled probes can be designed to detect the DNA sequences of this invention, and any use of specific markers or probes directed to any of the crylC genes of the invention is included herein. In one embodiment of this invention, the specific markers, primers or labeled probes do not detect or recognize any plant, preferably any plant of the same species as the test plant, not containing a crylC DNA sequence of the invention, particularly any such markers, primers or labeled probes do not detect or recognize any plant expressing a CrylC protein wherein such plant does not contain a DNA sequence of the invention (such as a crylC DNA as defined herein, e.g., a DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5, or the coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5).<br>
The DNA sequences of this invention can be slightly modified to allow for more convenient restriction enzyme sites, or to make small changes without changing the efficacy and wherein such DNA encodes a protein with the same or substantially the same insecticidal activity as the CrylC protein of the invention. Indeed, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, it is well known that most amino acid codons can be replaced by others without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein. Furthermore, some amino acids can be substituted by other equivalent amino acids or can be added without significantly changing the insecticidal activity of the protein. Equivalents of the DNA sequences of the invention include DNA sequences with less than 20, preferably 5-10, nucleotide differences compared to the crylC genes or coding sequences of this invention as defined herein, but which encode an insecticidal CrylC protein of the invention, as defined herein.<br>
With the term "substantially the same", when referring to the amino acid sequence of a CrylC protein of this invention, is meant to include an amino acid sequence that differs<br>
in no more than 5 %, preferably no more than 2 %, particularly no more than 1 % to the amino acid sequence of the protein compared to; and when referring to toxicity or insecticidal activity of a CrylC protein, is meant to include a protein whose LC50 value obtained under the same conditions of bio-assay (preferably in the same bio-assay using insects from the same population and suitable controls) differs no more than 2 times, preferably no more than 50 %, of the LC50 value obtained for the protein compared to.<br>
"Microorganism", as used herein, refers to any living organism that can be observed only with the aid of a microscope, such as bacteria, yeast cells, plant cells, viruses, fungi. This includes all generally unicellular organisms with dimensions beneath the limits of vision which can be propagated and manipulated in a laboratory, typically prokaryotic or unicellular eukaryotic life forms, including tissue cultures and plasmids.<br>
By an "insecticidally effective part (or portion or fragment)" of a DNA sequence encoding a CrylC protein, is meant a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide which has fewer amino acids than the CrylC protoxin as produced in nature by Bt but which is still insecticidal.<br>
In order to express all or an insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequence encoding a Cry protein of this invention in a microorganism or a recombinant host, e.g., E. coli, a Bt strain, a plant or plant cells, suitable restriction sites can be introduced, flanking the DNA sequence. This can be done by site-directed mutagenesis, using well-known procedures (Stanssens et al., 1989; White et al., 1989).<br>
For obtaining enhanced expression in plants and/or preventing expression of an insecticidal protein when not present in a plant host cell (such as in a bacterial or other prokaryote host cell), in one embodiment of the invention a plant intron, preferably a monocot plant intron, is inserted in the chimeric crylC genes of the invention, preferably in the coding sequence. Any of the known plant introns, preferably monocot plant introns, (e.g., Brown, 1986, Brown and Simpson, 1998, Brown et al., 1996) can be used herein as long as the intron is operably-linked to the coding sequence fragments so as to<br>
assure proper splicing in plant cells. Operable linkage of the intron and the resulting proper splicing is conveniently checked in the target host plant species or cells thereof by checking the production of an active protein, by RT-PCR, Northern blot or by any other means available in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the intron of the invention is a monocot intron, such as the Adh1 intron described by Dennis et al. (1984), e.g., the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 from nucleotide position 591 to nucleotide position 1124. In another embodiment of the invention, the intron contained in the insecticidal protein coding sequence, particularly the CrylC coding sequence, is the second intron of the light-inducible tissue-specific ST-LS1 gene of Solanum tuberosum (potato) as described by Eckes et al. (1986).<br>
In one embodiment of this invention a plant intron is operably-linked to parts of the coding sequences of any Bt insecticidal protein coding sequence to be expressed in a plant cell, so that it is effectively spliced in plant cells and a Bt insecticidal protein is produced. Effective splicing in plants cells can be measured using routine techniques, such as RT-PCR, Northern blotting, or the detection of a functional protein produced in plant cells. Of course, for effective splicing the Intron needs to be inserted in the correct position of the coding sequence so that functional 5' and 3' splice sites are obtained in the sequence. The intron in the crylC chimeric genes of the invention, such as in the ery1C1 or cry1C2 chimeric genes, is effectively spliced in rice plant cells, since high insect mortality is seen in insect bio-assays on plants expressing such crylC chimeric genes. RT-PCR also shows that the plants comprising the crylC gene of the invention produce an mRNA encoding the expected Cry protein.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, the CrylC protein is targeted to intracellular organelles such as plastids, preferably chloroplasts, or mitochondria. For this purpose, the chimeric genes of the invention comprise a coding region encoding a signal or target peptide, linked to the DNA encoding the CrylC protein of the invention. Particularly preferred peptides to be included in the proteins of this invention are the transit peptides for chloroplast or other plastid targeting, especially duplicated transit peptide regions from plant genes whose gene product is targeted to the plastids, such as the optimized transit peptide of SEQ ID No. 4, the optimized transit peptide described by Lebrun et al. (1996), or Capellades et al. (US Patent 5,635,618), the transit peptide of<br>
ferredoxin-NADP+oxidoreductase from spinach (Oelmuller et al., 1993), the transit peptide described in Wong et al. (1992) or the targeting peptides in published PCT patent application WO 00/26371. In one embodiment of the invention, the chloroplast transit peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 124 or variant thereof, such as a chloroplast transit peptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 124, wherein the Cys amino acid at position 55 is replaced by Tyr in SEQ ID No. 4 and/or wherein a Gly amino acid is added after the Gly amino acid at position 51 in SEQ ID No. 4.<br>
Particularly useful DNAs encoding.signal peptides in accordance with the invention, to combine with a crylC DNA of the invention, include the DNAs encoding any one of the following proteins, or combinations thereof: the chloroplast transit peptides described by Van Den Broeck et al. (1985), or the optimized chloroplast transit peptide of US patent 5, 510,471 and US patent 5,635,618 causing transport of the protein to the chloroplasts, a secretory signal peptide or a peptide targeting the protein to other plastids, mitochondria, the ER, or another organelle. A preferred DNA encoding a transit peptide of the invention is a DNA comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 372, particularly the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3, or an equivalent sequence with at least 95 %, particularly at least 97 or 99 %, sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID No.3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 372.<br>
Furthermore, for any target pest insect, the binding properties of the Cry proteins of the invention can be evaluated, using methods known in the art (e.g., Van Rie et al., 1990, EP 408403), to determine if the Cry1 proteins of the invention bind to sites on a target insect midgut that are not recognized (or competed for) by other Cry or non-Cry proteins. Other Bt crystal proteins binding to different binding sites in relevant susceptible insects, or other toxins derived from Bt strains or other sources (such as VIP toxins (e.g., the VIP3A toxins listed at http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/horne/Neil Crickmore/Bt/vip.html. or the VIP3Aa toxin of Estruch et al., 1996) or insect (gut) proteinase inhibitors) with a different mode of action can be very valuable to also express in a plant in addition to any one of the crylC genes of the invention, to prevent or delay the development of insect resistance to a plant expressing insecticidal toxins, and increase the spectrum of insects<br>
controlled by a plant of the invention. In one method, a protein having a different mode of action from the CrylC protein of the invention can be found by screening proteins for their insecticidal effect on CrytC-resistant insects, or alternatively when the biochemical mechanism or pathway by which such protein acts is found to be different from that used by the CrylC protein, such that a mutation in the insect causing CrylC resistance is unlikely to affect the toxicity of the other protein. Because of the characteristics of the new crylC genes, they are extremely useful for transforming plants, e.g. monocot plants such as com, sugarcane, rice or wheat and dicot plants such as cotton, soybean, eggplant and Brassica species plants, to protect these plants from insect damage.<br>
Especially for insect resistance management purposes for a specific insect pest, it is preferred to combine a crylC gene of this invention with another gene encoding a different insect control protein, particularly a Bt crystal protein. A preferred insect control protein to combine with the CrylC proteins of this invention, particularly for simultaneous expression in plants, preferably rice plants, is a CrylAb protein. A "CrylAb protein", as used herein, is any insecticidal CrylAb protein, particularly an insecticidal protein comprising an amino acid sequence identical to or at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 30 to amino acid position 617, or identical to or at least 95 %, 97 %. 98 %, or 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 617, or a insecticidal protein comprising an amino acid sequence identical to or at least 95 %, 97 %, .98 %, or 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 617 which is fused at its' N-terminus to the protein of SEQ ID No. In one embodiment, such co-expression is obtained by transforming a plant with a plasmid comprising a crylC and crylAb chimeric gene, or by cotransforming a plant with a plasmid comprising a crylC chimeric gene and a plasmid comprising a crylAb chimeric gene, or by transforming a plant already containing a chimeric crylC gene of the invention, with a crylAb chimeric gene. A "crylAb'chimeric gene", as used herein, is a chimeric gene encoding a CrylAb protein as defined above, e.g., a chimeric gene comprising the following operably-linked sequences: a) a coding region encoding an insecticidal CrylAb protein, comprising a DNA sequence with at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %,<br>
or 99 % sequence identity to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 11 from nucleotide position 88 to nucleotide position 1851. or comprising a DNA sequence with at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99 % sequence identity to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 11 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 1851, or comprising the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 11 from nucleotide position 88 to nucleotide position 1851, or comprising the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 11 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 1851, or comprising any of such DNA sequences, such as the sequence of SEQ ID No. 11 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 1851, linked at its 5 ' end to the transit peptide coding sequence of SEQ ID No.3, and b) a (second) promoter region capable of directing expression in plant cells. The CrylAb protein encoded by such chimeric gene comprises an amino acid sequence at least 99 % identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 30 to amino acid position 617, or comprises an amino acid sequence at least 99 % identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 617, or comprises an amino acid sequence at least 99 % identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No.12, or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 30 to amino acid position 617, or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12 from amino acid position 3 to amino acid position 617, or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No.12.<br>
Transformed plants comprising both a crylC and crylAb chimeric gene can also be obtained by crossing plants comprising any one of the chimeric crylAb genes as defined above, with plants comprising any one of the chimeric crylC chimeric genes of the invention. In one embodiment, the plants, cells, seeds or grains of the invention, particularly the rice plants, cells, seeds or grains of the invention, comprise the chimeric crylC gene of the invention and a chimeric crylAb gene, as defined above at the same genetic locus, so that these genes do not segregate in progeny plant cells, plants, seeds or grains.<br>
General methods for obtaining expression of different Bt chimeric genes in the same plant in an effort to minimize or prevent resistance development to transgenic insect-resistant plants are described in EP patent 0 408 403.<br>
For selection purposes but also for increasing the weed control options, the transgenic plants of the invention can also be transformed with a DNA encoding a protein inactivating a broad-spectrum herbicide or encoding a protein which is a variant of the protein target for the herbicide but which protein variant is insensitive to such herbicide, e.g., herbicides based on glufosinate or glyphosate. In case such herbicide resistance genes are later to be removed or crossed out of the crylC plants of the invention, the herbicide resistance.genes are preferably located at another locus than the crylC or the crylC and crylAb genes of the invention. A preferred herbicide resistance gene in accordance with this invention is a bar coding sequence (Thompson et al., 1987) operably-linked to a 35S promoter (Odell et al.. 1985) and a 3' untranslated region of the nopaline synthase gene of Agrobacterium (Depicker et al., 1982) such that, the plants transformed with such chimeric bar gene are resistant to glufosinate herbicides.<br>
The insecticidally effective crylC DNA of this invention, preferably the crylC chimeric gene of this invention, can be stably inserted in a conventional manner into the nuclear genome of a plant cell, and the so-transformed plant cell can be used in a conventional manner to produce plants and seeds, comprising the crylC gene of the invention, that are insect-resistant. In this regard, a disarmed Ti-plasrnid, containing the insecticidally effective crylC gene part, in Agrobacterium, e.g., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, can be used to transform the plant cell, and thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using any of known procedure, e.g., the procedures described in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application ("EP") 0 242 246 and in De Block et al. (1989). Preferred Ti-plasmid vectors each contain the insecticidally effective cry gene part between the border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence, of the T-DNA of the Ti-plasmid. Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for example in EP 0 233 247), pollen mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 270 356, PCT publication WO 85/01856, and US Patent 4,684,611), plant RNA virus-mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 067 553 and US Patent 4,407,956), liposome-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US Patent 4,536,475), and other methods such as the methods for transforming certain lines of<br>
corn (e.g., US patent 6,140,553; Fromm et al., 1990; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990) and the method for transforming monocots generally (PCT publication WO 92/09696). For rice transformation, a preferred transformation method is described in WO 92/09696. For cotton transformation, especially preferred is the method described in PCT patent publication WO 00/71733. For soybean transformation, reference is made to methods known in the art, e.g., Hinchee et al. (1988) and Christou et al. (1990), or the method of ' WO 00/42207.<br>
The resulting transformed plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed plants with the same characteristics or to introduce the insecticidally effective crylC gene in other varieties of the same or related plant species. Seeds, which are obtained from the transformed plants, contain the insecticidally effective cry gene part as a stable genomic insert.<br>
The insecticidally effective crylC DNA of this invention, preferably a DNA comprising the sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 or 5,.is inserted in a plant cell genome so that the inserted gene is downstream (i.e., 3') of, and under the control of, a promoter which can direct expression of the gene in a plant cell (herein named a "plant-expressible promoter"). This is preferably accomplished by inserting the crylC chimeric gene comprising a plant-expressible promoter in the plant cell genome, particularly in the nuclear or plastid (e.g., chloroplast) genome. Preferred plant-expressible promoters include: the strong constitutive 35S promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al., 1981), CabbB-S (Franck et al., 1980) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987); the 35S promoter described by Odell et al. (1985), promoters from the ubiquitin family (e.g., the maize ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al., 1992, see also Cornejo et al., 1993), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al., 1992), the emu promoter (Last et al., 1990), Arabidopsis actin promoters such as the promoter described by An et al. (1996), rice actin promoters such as the promoter described by Zhang et al. (1991) or McElroy et al. (1990); promoters of the Cassava vein mosaic virus (WO 97/48819, Verdaguer et al. (1998)), the pPLEX series of promoters from Subterranean Clover Stunt Virus (WO 96/06932), particularly the duplicated promoter region derived from the subterranean clover stunt virus genome segment 4 or 7 (referred to as the "S7S7" or "S4S4" promoters herein) described by Boevink et al. (1995) or<br>
Schiinmann et al. (2003), an alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, e.g., pAdhlS (GenBank accession numbers X04049, X00581), and the TR1' promoter and the TR2" promoter (the "TR1' promoter" and 'TR2' promoter", respectively) which drive the expression of the T and 2' genes, respectively, of the T-DNA (Velten et al., 1984). Alternatively, a promoter can be utilized which is not constitutive but rather is specific for one or more tissues or organs of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or roots) whereby the inserted cry gene part is expressed only in cells of the specific tissue(s) or organ(s). For example, the fnsecticidally effective cry gene part could be selectively expressed in the leaves of a plant (e.g., com, cotton) by placing the insecticidally effective gene part under the control of a light-inducible promoter such as the promoter of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene of the plant itself or of another plant such as pea as disclosed in US Patent 5,254,799. Another alternative is to use a promoter whose expression is inducible, preferably by wounding such as insect feeding, e.g., the MPI promoter described by Cordero et al. (1994, Genbank accession X78988), or the Agrobacterium TR2' or mannopine synthase promoter (Velten et al., 1984) or a promoter inducible by chemical factors. In one embodiment of the invention, if that is desired, expression of such wound-inducible promoters can be increased by placing a CaMV 35S promoter region or another promoter or at least a promoter enhancer element in the vicinity of, and preferably in the same direction (5' to 3") as, the wound-inducible promoter, so that basal expression levels are increased but induction upon wounding is retained.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, preferred promoters used in the cr/1C chimeric gene of the invention or in the crylAb chimeric gene of the invention include promoters comprising the DNA sequence of any one of SEQ ID Nos. 9 (or comprising the sequence from nucleotide position 1 to 1997 in SEQ ID No. 9), 10, 13, 14, or an equivalent sequence differing in less than 1 to 5 %, particularly less than 2 %, of its nucleotides with any of such sequence. Such promoters can include an untranslated leader sequence, and can also comprise an intron. In one embodiment of the invention, the cr/1C chimeric gene comprises the leader sequence of the Zea mays ubiquitin gene between the promoter and the coding region, e.g., as described by Christensen et al. (1992), and the crylAb chimeric gene comprises the intron and leader sequence of the rice Actin 1 gene (McElroy et al.. 1990) between the promoter and the coding region.<br>
The crylC DNA is preferably inserted in the plant genome so that the inserted coding sequence is upstream (i.e., 5') of suitable 3" end transcription regulation signals (i.e., transcript formation and polyadenylation signals). This can be accomplished by inserting the crylC chimeric gene in the plant cell genome. Preferred polyadenylation and transcript formation signals include those of the 3' untranslated region of the NADP-malic enzyme gene from Flaveria bidentis (Marshall et al., 1996), nopaline synthase gene (Depicker et al., 1982), the octopine synthase gene (Gielen et al., 1984) and the T-DNA gene 7 (Velten and Schell, 1985), which act as 3-untranslated DNA sequences in transformed plant cells.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the crylC gene of the invention is transformed into plants selected from the group consisting of: corn, cotton, rice, soybean, sugarcane, wheat, canola, soybean, vegetable plants, Cruciferae plant species, Brassica plant species such as cauliflower, cabbage, Chinese cabbage, turnip, mustard, oilseed rape, kale, broccoli. In one embodiment of this invention the following Brassica species plants are protected from insects by the crylC genes of this invention: B. carinata, B. juncea, B. napus, B. nigra, B. oleracea, and 6. rapa.<br>
The invention includes plants, cells or seeds, particularly rice plants, cells or seeds, transformed with a crylC gene of the invention, as well as plants, cells or seeds, particularly rice plants, cells or seeds, containing the genes of the invention obtained after crossing or breeding with such transformed plants, cells or seeds. Such crossing or breeding can be done using traditional breeding techniques known in the art, but may also include known in vitro work such as doubled haploid production, embryo rescue, protoplast fusion, and the like. As such, the invention also relates to japonica rice plants, cells or seeds, and the progeny thereof that contain the crylC gene of the invention, obtained from crossings with a cry7C-trahsformed indica rice plant, cell or seed, and to any uses of such plants, cells or seeds. Included herein are crosses of rice plants comprising any of the crylC and/or crylAb chimeric genes of the invention with other plants comprising rice transformation events conferring insect control or another beneficial trait (e.g., herbicide tolerance, yield increase, stress tolerance, etc.), such as crosses with Bt-rice event TT51 expressing a Cry1 Ab/Cry1 Ac fusion protein (Chinese<br>
patent application 200510062980, publication number 1840655), or crosses with rice events expressing a Cry1Ca5 protein (such as event T1C-19. see Tang et al. 2006), a CrylB protein (see, e.g., Breitler et al. (2001), or a Cry2A protein (see, e.g., Maqbool et al. (1998)), or expressing a Cry1Ab-Cry1B fusion protein (Ho et al., 2006), as well as rice plants comprising the stacked insect control genes or uses thereof to control insects, particularly rice stem borers or rice leaf folders.<br>
Transformation of plant cells can also be used to produce the cryiC proteins of the invention in plant cell cultures, e.g., to produce a CryiC protein that can then be applied onto crops after proper formulation. When reference to a transgenic plant cell is made herein, this refers to a plant cell (or also a plant protoplast) as such in isolation or in tissue culture, or to a plant cell (or protoplast) contained in a plant or in a differentiated organ or tissue, and both possibilities are specifically included herein. Hence, a reference to a plant cell in the description or claims is not meant to refer only to isolated cells in culture, but refers to any plant cell, wherever it may be located or in whatever type of plant tissue or organ it may be present. Plant cell, as used herein, also refers to protoplasts or pollen.<br>
The coding sequence of the cryiC genes of the invention can also be used to transform microorganisms, such as a B. thuringiensis strain which has insecticidal activity against Lepidoptera or Coleoptera. Thereby, a transformed microorganism such as a Bt strain can be produced which is useful for combating a wide spectrum of lepidopteran and coleopteran insect pests or for combating additional lepidopteran insect pests. Transformation of microorganism, such as bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, Agrobactehum, Bacillus or Eschen'chia, with the coding sequence of the cryiC genes of this invention, incorporated in a suitable cloning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably using conventional electroporation techniques as described in Mahillon et al. (1989) and in PCT Patent publication WO 90/06999.<br>
Transformed Bacillus species strains containing a cryiC coding sequence can be fermented by conventional methods (Dulmage, 1981; Bernhard and Utz, 1993) to provide high yields of cells. Under appropriate conditions which are well understood (Dulmage, 1981), these strains each sporulate to produce crystal proteins containing the Cry1 C protein.<br>
An insecticidal, particularly anti-lepidopteran, composition of this invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using the microorganisms expressing the CrylC toxin as an active ingredient, together with suitable carriers, diluents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants (e.g., as described by Bernhard and Utz, 1993). This insecticide composition can be formulated as a wettable powder, pellets, granules or dust or as a liquid formulation with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents as a foam, gel, suspension, concentrate, etc.<br>
A method for controlling insects, particularly Lepidoptera, preferably Lepidopteran rice insects such as stem borers and leaf folders, in accordance with this invention can comprise applying (e.g., spraying), to a locus (area) to be protected, an insecticidal amount of the CrylC proteins or host cells transformed with the crylC gene of this invention. The locus to be protected can include, for example, the habitat of the insect pests or growing vegetation, such as a rice field, or an area where vegetation is to be grown.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, insects against which the crylC genes or CrylC proteins of the invention can be used include insects selected from the group consisting of: Plutella xylostella, Spodoptera exigua, Spodoptera littoralis, Spodoptera frugiperda, Trichoplusia ni, Heliothis virescens, Mamestra brassicae, Pieris brassicae, Manduca sexta, Choristoneura fumiferana, Choristoneura occidentalis, Choristoneura rosaceana, Pandemis pyrusana, Platynota stultana, Lymantria dispar, Orgyia leucostigma, Malacosoma disstria, Lambina fiscellaria, Chilo suppressalis, Chilo plejadellus, Chilo polychrysa, Chilo pariellus, Scirpophaga incertulas, Scirpophaga innotata, Sesamia inferens, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, Marasmia patnalis, Argyrotaenia citrana, Artogeia rapa, Chrysomela scripts, Ostrinia nubilalis, Diatraea saccharalis, Pseudoplusia includens, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, Hereitogramma licarisalis, Naranga aenescens, Mycalesis gotama, Marasmia exigua, Marasmia ruralis, Nymphula depunctalis, Spodoptera litura, Rupela albinella, Spodoptera frugiperda, Mythimna unipuncta, Chilo zacconius and Parnara guttata.<br>

The proteins encoded by the crylC or the crylC and cry 1 Ah genes of this invention are particularly useful to control these insects, e.g., by expression of the crylC and/or crylAb genes of the invention in cells of a plant, particularly in rice plant cells.<br>
Such insects can be controlled by sowing, planting, or growing plants comprising any one of the crylC chimeric genes of the invention in a field, or by securing the presence of a CrylC protein of the invention in or on plants that can be infested by such insects (e.g., by sowing or planting a rice plant transformed with a crylC chimeric gene of the invention, such as the cry1C1 or cry1C2 chimeric genes). The invention also relates to the use of the crylC chimeric genes of this invention, at least the cry1C1 or cry1C2 chimeric genes, in plants, cells or seeds, particularly rice plants, cells or seeds, to protect them against Lepidopteran insect pests, preferably in combination with another cry gene, such as a crylAb chimeric gene, preferably the crylAbl or cryiAbl chimeric genes.<br>
In the current invention, also a modified coding sequence encoding an optimized chloroplast transit peptide is provided, as well as the use thereof to target a protein to the chloroplast. In one embodiment of the invention, the coding sequence for the optimized transit peptide comprises a nucleotide sequence identical to or with at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99 % sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 372, particularly to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3, or a DNA encoding a protein comprising an amino acid sequence identical to or with at least 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, or 99 % sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID No. 4. Also plant cells, plants or seeds, particularly rice plants cells, plants or seeds, comprising the modified transit peptide coding sequence of the invention, as well<br>
as the use of this transit peptide coding sequence for targeting any protein to the chloroplast, particularly to the chloroplast of rice plants, are included in this invention. In one embodiment of the invention, the coding sequence for the optimized transit peptide comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 3 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide position 372, particularly the sequence of SEQ ID No. 3, is operably-linked to the DNA encoding a Cry1 C protein of the invention, such as the cry1C1 or cry1C2 genes, and/or is operably linked to the coding sequence of the ciylAb gene, such as the crylAbl or cry1Ab2 coding sequences, so as to secure chloroplast targeting in the plant cells, plants or seeds of the invention, particularly rice plant cells, plants or seeds.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
1.Construction of chimeric genes and transformation vectors.<br>
Several crylC chimeric genes for transformation of plants, particularly rice plants, were designed. The use of a diversity of genes and regulatory elements allows the selection of plants for different purposes or uses. Bioassays with the Cry1 C protein of SEQ ID No. 2 (Cry1Ca4) show that this protein is toxic to the Lepidopteran insects Scirpophaga incertulas, Sesamia inferens, Spodoptera litura, Spodoptera exigua, Marasmia patnalis, and Cnaphalocmcis medinalis, and hence is a useful protein to express in transgenic plants.<br>
The cry1C1 DNA which was designed for optimal expression in plant cells, particularly rice, is represented in SEQ ID No. 1. This cry1C1 DNA has the corn Adh1 intron I (Dennis ,et al., 1984) inserted into the crylC coding sequence. This DNA encodes the insecticidal Cry1C1 protein of the invention (SEQ ID No. 2). For transformation of plants, several chimeric genes were constructed (the ciy1C1 chimeric genes) comprising the following operably-linked elements (5' to 3'): a promoter comprising the promoter region of SEQ ID No. 9 (pUbi) or 10 (pMPI(2K)), the cry1C1 DNA of SEQ ID No. 1, and the sequence including the 3' untranslated region of the octopine synthase gene from Agrobacterium (De Greve et al., 1983).<br>
To secure targeting of the CrylG protein to the plant cell chloroplast, also a variant of the cry1C1 chimeric gene was constructed which comprises a modified sequence encoding an optimized transit peptide (SEQ ID No. 4) essentially as described by Lebrun et al. (1996), operably-linked to the DNA encoding the Cry1C1 protein so that a transit peptide fusion protein (the Cry1C2 protein) is expressed in plant cells. For transformation of plants, several chimeric genes were constructed (the cry1C2 chimeric genes) comprising the following operably-linked elements (5' to 3'): a promoter comprising the promoter region of SEQ ID No. 9 or 10, the cry1C2 DNA of SEQ ID No. 5. and the sequence including the 3' untranslated region of the octopine synthase gene from Agrobacterium (DeGreveetal., 1983).<br>
To obtain plants expressing two different Cry proteins, also crylAb chimeric genes were designed and assembled to achieve a set of crylAb chimeric genes to be used in plants, particularly rice plants. Also here different genes and regulatory elements were used to allow the selection of plants for different purposes or uses.<br>
The crylAbl DNA which was designed for optimal expression in plant cells is represented in SEQ ID No. 11. This DNA encodes the insecticidal CrylAbl protein (SEQ ID No. 12). For transformation of plants, several chimeric genes are constructed (the crylAbl chimeric genes) comprising the following operably-linked elements (5' to 3'): a promoter comprising the promoter region of SEQ ID No. 9, 10, 13 or 14, the crylAbl DNA of SEQ ID No. 11, and the sequence including the 3' polyadenylation and transcript termination region of the octopine synthase gene from Agrobacterium (De Greveetal., 1983).<br>
To secure targeting of the CrylAb protein to the plant cell chloroplast, a variant of the crylAbl chimeric gene is constructed which comprises a modified sequence encoding an optimized transit peptide (SEQ ID No. 4) essentially as described by Lebrun et al. (1996), operably-linked to the crylAbl coding region so that a transit peptide fusion protein (the Cry1Ab2 protein) is expressed in plant cells. For transformation of plants, several chimeric genes are constructed (the cry1Ab2 chimeric genes) comprising the following operably-linked elements (5' to 3'): a promoter comprising the promoter region of SEQ ID No. 9, 10, 13 or 14, the transit peptide DNA of SEQ ID No. 3 linked upstream (5') of the crylAbl DNA of SEQ ID No. 5 from nucleotide position 7 to nucleotide<br>
position 1854, and the sequence including the 3' untranslated region of the octopine synthase gene from Agrobacterium (De Greve et al., 1983).<br>
In some chimeric genes, also a CaMV 35S promoter region is used to control transcription of the operably-linked cry1C(1 or 2) or cry1Ab(1 or 2) coding sequences described above.<br>
The transformation vectors (intermediate cloning vectors) containing the genes of the invention were derived from pGSC1700 (Cornelissen and Vandewiele, 1989). The vector backbone contains the following genetic elements:<br>
a)	the plasmid core comprising the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (Bolivar et al., 1977) for replication in Escherichia coli and a restriction fragment comprising the origin of replication from the Pseudomonas plasmid pVS1 (Itoh et al., 1984) for replication in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.<br>
b)	a selectable marker gene conferring resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin (aadA) for propagation and selection of the plasmid in Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.<br>
c)	a DNA region consisting of a fragment of the neomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence of the nptl gene from transposon Tn903 (Oka et al., 1981).<br>
The T-DNA region of each transformation vector can also further contain - besides one of the above, cry genes - a chimeric bar gene that serves as selectable marker gene. Expression of the bar gene enables the production of an enzyme, phosphinothricin-acetyl transferase, that metabolizes the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, thus rendering it non-herbicidal in the plant. The chimeric bar gene comprises the 35S3 promoter region from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S transcript (Odell et al.,1985), the oar coding sequence of the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus as described by Thompson et al. (1987), and a 3' transcript termination and polyadenylation sequence from the 3' untranslated region of the nopaline synthase gene from the T-DNA of pTiT37 (Depicker et al., 1982). In some transformations, two intermediate cloning plasmids are used for transformation: one plasmid containing the crylC chimeric gene or containing both the crylC and crylAb chimeric genes, the other plasmid containing the chimeric bar gene; in other transformations one plasmid comprises the crylC chimeric gene and another plasmid comprises the crylAb chimeric<br>
gene (one of each or both such plasmids can also comprise a chimeric bar gene). This approach allows obtaining different types of rice transformants with the different genes at different loci or at the same locus in the genome of the rice plants, so that in some plants one chimeric gene (e.g., the bar gene, or one of the cry genes) can be removed from the other chimeric gene(s) in the plants by breeding, e.g., in case herbicide tolerance in the final rice plants to be marketed is not required, or in case only the crylC gene is to be crossed into rice plants containing another cry gene (such as a stack of the crylC gene of the Invention with the crylA gene in rice event TT51 (Chinese patent application 200510062980, publication number 1840655)).<br>
All constructed plasmids are confirmed to be accurate by restriction enzyme digest analysis and by DNA sequencing, before they are used for plant transformation.<br>
2.Plant transformation and regeneration.<br>
The acceptor Agrobacterium strain carries a non-oncogenic (disarmed) Ti plasmid from which the T-region has been deleted. This Ti plasmid carries the necessary vir gene functions that are required for transfer of the T-DNA region (containing the above crylC and/or crylAb chimeric genes) of the intermediate cloning vector to the plant genome. It also has a homology region that allows cointegrate formation with the intermediate cloning vector.<br>
The intermediate cloning vector is constructed in Escherichia coli. It is transferred to the acceptor Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain via a triparental mating involving an E. coli strain that carries a mobilization helper plasmid. The structure of the T-DNA in the resulting Agrobacterium strain is confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (Deblaere et al., 1985).<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer of the intermediate cloning vector(s) results in transfer of the DNA fragment between the T-DNA border repeats to the plant genome.<br>
As target tissue for transformation, immature embryo or embryo-derived callus derived from japonica and indica rice cultivars was used which has been cut into small pieces, essentially using the technique described in PCT patent publication WO 92/09696.<br>
Agrobacterium was co-cultivated with the rice tissues for some days, and then removed<br>
by suitable antibiotics. Transformed rice cells were selected by addition of glufosinate<br>
ammonium (with phosphinothricin 5 mg/L) to the rice tissue culture medium.<br>
Calli growing on media with glufosinate ammonium were transferred to regeneration<br>
medium.   When plantlets with roots and shoots develop, they were transferred to soil,<br>
and placed in the greenhouse.<br>
When they flower, selected transformed rice plants were self-pollinated, and seeds<br>
comprising the introduced chimeric genes were harvested when mature.<br>
Oilseed rape plants are also transformed with the crylC and/or crylAb chimeric genes of the invention using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Hypocotyl explants of Brassica napus are used in routine transformation and regeneration methods, e.g., the method described by De Block et al. (1989).<br>
3.Analysis of transformants.<br>
Once the transformed rice plants were regenerated, PCR and Southern analysis are used to confirm integration of the transgenes. Specific primers for detecting the presence of the crylC coding region of the invention were prepared, they were designated PS1203 and P1C204 (SEQ ID No. 7 and 8, respectively). Rice and oilseed rape plants having a single copy of the crylC chimeric gene integrated into their genome are selected by means of Southern blot. Immunological analysis such as CrylC (or Cry1Ab-)-specific ELISA assays or Western blots are used to select those transformed plants showing optimal expression levels of the CrylC protein or of the CrylC and CrylAb protein. Initial ELISA assays on 12 TO plants comprising different transformation events obtained after transforming rice plants with a plasmid comprising the PUbi-c/y7C7-3'ocs chimeric gene (besides a P35S-bar-3' nos chimeric gene and a PAct1-cry7AM-3'ocs chimeric gene) showed values of the Cry1Ca4 protein ranging between 8.4 and 47.9 microgram/gram fresh leaf weight, confirming good expression of the CryICa protein in these transformed rice plants.<br>
RT-PCR experiments on RNA collected from rice plants shown to be transformed with the crylC genes of SEQ ID No. 1 or 3, comprising a plant intron, showed that splicing occurs correctly and that a functional CrylC protein is produced.<br>
Insect assays using Spodoptera exigua neonate larvae under standard insect bio-assay conditions on selected transformed rice plants containing the cry1C2 gene of the invention under control of the mpi promoter of SEQ ID No. 10 (pMPI), showed that the transformed plants have high insecticidal activity. After 3 days, in all rice plants showing significant expression of the CrylC protein in ELISA assays, 100% mortality was found for the S. exigua larvae, with some plants showing no visible leaf damage, while the control plants or plants without detectable expression levels of CrylC, showed severe leaf damage or had no remaining leaves. These insect assays confirm that the intron contained in the coding region of the cry1C2 chimeric gene of the invention is correctly spliced in the transgenic rice plants.<br>
Effective splicing in oilseed rape plants is seen in the clear insecticidal effects in insect bio-assays on plants transformed with the crylC chimeric genes of the invention.<br>
Also, in the rice plants expressing a CrylC or CrylAb protein under control of a MPI promoter, a significant increase in expression of the CrylC or CrylAb protein has been demonstrated in the plants that were wounded.<br>
Initial greenhouse trials with single gene-copy crylC, crylAb, and crylC + crylAb-transformed rice plants (representing a variety of different transformation events where the chimeric genes were under the control of the above-described pMPI(2K) or pUbi, some chimeric genes containing the transit peptide of SEQ ID No. 4 operably-linked to the cry coding region (see enclosed Table 1)) using pink stem borer (Sesamia inferens) insect infestation (60 larvae/plant applied at different dates) confirmed the high insecticidal activity of both the single gene and dual gene rice plants (T1 plants, 10 plants analyzed per transformation event). While in untransformed control rice plants there was a high number of "dead heart", the number of tillers per plant was low (about 6 per plant), the complete leaf sheath was damaged, and larger insect larvae or pupa were found on the plants; in the transformed CrylC, CrylAb and in the dual Bt (CrylC + CrylAb) rice plants, no dead hart was seen, the number of tillers per plant was higher (between about 7 to about 13 tillers per plant, most above 10 tillers per plant), no or only some insect entry holes were found while the leaf sheath was not showing any major damage, and no live insects were found on most plants. Most transgenic rice plants showed an absence of insect tunnels, while the stem of the control plants was<br>
completely tunnelled. ELISA assays confirm that these plants have significant and clearly detectable levels of CrylC and CrylAb protein.<br>
An excerpt of the initial insect assay data after pink stem borer infestation (for selected rice transformation events) are shown in Table 1 enclosed below, which shows the average values for the data obtained from 10 plants per transformation event.<br>
Initial greenhouse trials for yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) also showed good resistance of transgenic T1 plants (2 plants per event were tested, events were transformed with the same chimeric gene(s) as mentioned in column 1 of Table 1) to this insect (10-15 larvae were applied per plant). For this insect, no live larvae were found (about one month after insects were applied) on the rice plants containing the chimeric cry genes, while in the untransformed control plants several later instar larvae and pupae were found (also after about one month). None of the rice plants containing the chimeric cry genes of the invention (crylC, crylAb or crylC + crylAb) showed symptoms of dead heart, or showed any tunnels, while control plants were heavily damaged (high level of dead hearth and many tunnels).<br>
Further selection of transformed rice plants expressing the CrylC protein, or expressing the CrylC and CrylAb proteins, is done using insect tests on yellow stem borer, pink stem borer and leaf folders in the greenhouse. For these tests, several transgenic plant series of each preselected transformation event (as well as negative controls) are grown in a greenhouse and infested with neonate larvae of either the yellow stem borer, the pink stem borer or the rice leaffolder at different stages of rice development. Plants of a first series are infested with neonate larvae of the yellow stem borer, the pink stem borer or rice leaffolder, at the tillering stage. About three weeks later all plants are dissected and scored for insect damage for each insect tested (for percentage dead hart and larval survival for the yellow stem and pink stem borer, and for percentage damaged tillers, larval survival, and damage rating (0-9) for rice leaffolder). A second series of plants is infested with neonate larvae of the yellow stem borer, or the pink stem borer, at the heading stage. About three weeks later all plants are dissected and scored for insect damage (for percentage white head and larval survival). A third series of plants is infested with neonate larvae of the yellow stem borer or the pink stem borer, at the post flowering stage. About three weeks later all plants are dissected and scored for insect damage (for percentage white head and larval survival).<br>
The oilseed rape and rice plants showing optimal insect control are selected for further analysis and reproduction.<br>
Progeny plants and seeds are also obtained from the transformed, selected plants of the invention, and the genes of the invention are shown to segregate in such progeny in the expected Mendelian fashion. Selection of the transgenic plants in the greenhouse and in the field at multiple locations results in the identification of plant lines which have optimal stability and expression of the crylC (or crylC and crylAb) chimeric genes combined with optimal agronomical performance. Crossing of the selected best performing transgenic events into different commercial germplasm, after repeated backcrossing, results in the presence of the crylC gene of the invention, or the crylC and crylAb genes in different genetic backgrounds, optimally adapted to different areas or climatic conditions.<br>
