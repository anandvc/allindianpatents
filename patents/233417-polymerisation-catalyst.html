				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a polymerisation catalyst.<br>
The present invention relates to transition metal-based polymerisation and oligomerisation catalysts and to their use in the polymerisation, copolymerisation and oligomerisation of olefins.<br>
The use of certain transition metal compounds to polymerise 1-olefms, for example, ethylene or propylene, is well established in the prior art. The use of Ziegler-Natta catalysts, for example, those catalysts produced by activating titanium halides with organometallic compounds such as triethylaluminium, is fundamental to many commercial processes for manufacturing polyolefins. Over the lost three decades, advances in the technology have led to the development of Ziegler-Natta catalysts which have such high activities that olefin polymers and copolymers containing very low concentrations of residual catalyst can be produced directly in commercial polymerisation processes. The quantities of residual catalyst remaining in the produced polymer are so small as to render unnecessary their separation and removal for most commercial applications. Such processes can be operated by polymerising the monomers in the gas phase, or in solution or in suspension in a liquid hydrocarbon diluent, or, in the case of propylene in bulk.<br>
Commodity polyethylenes are commercially produced in a variety of different types and grades. Homopolymerisation of ethylene with transition metal based catalysts leads to the production of so-called "high density" grades of polyethylene. These polymers have relatively high stiffness and are useful for making articles where inherent rigidity is required. Copolymerisation of ethylene with higher 1-olefins (eg butene, hexene or octene) is employed commercially to provide a wide variety of copolymers<br><br>
differing in density and in other important physical properties. Particularly important copolymers made by copolymerising ethylene with higher l-olefins using transition metal based catalysts are the copolymers having a density in the range of 0.91 to 0.93. These copolymers which are generally referred to in the art as "linear low density polyethylene" are in many respects similar to the so-called "low density" polyethylene produced by the high pressure free radical catalysed polymerisation of ethylene. Such polymers and copolymers are used extensively in the manufacture of flexible blown film.<br>
Polypropylenes are also commercially produced in a variety of different types and grades. Homopolymerisation of propylene with transition metal based catalysts leads to the production of grades with a wide variety of applications. Copolymers of propylene with ethylene or terpolymers with ethylene and higher 1-olefins are also useful materials, often used in film applications.<br>
In recent years the use of certain metallocene catalysts (for example biscyclopentadienylzirconiumdichloride-activated with alumoxane) has provided catalysts with potentially high activity. Other derivatives of metallocenes have been ' shown to be potentially useful for producing polypropylene with good activity, molecular weight and tacticity control. However, metallocene catalysts of this type suffer from a number of disadvantages, for example, high sensitivity to impurities when used with commercially available monomers, diluents and process gas streams, the need to use large quantities of expensive alumoxanes to achieve high activity, difficulties in putting the catalyst on to a suitable support and synthetic difficulties in the production of more complex catalyst structures suitable for polymerising propene in a tactic manner.<br>
Olefin oligomerisation is also a commercially important process, leading to the production of .1-olefins (1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, etc) that find utility in a wide range of applications, for example as comonomers for linear low density polyethylene, monomers for poly(l-olefins) and starting materials for surfactants. Catalysts based on a wide range of metal complexes may be used for this process and typically produce a so-called "Schulz-Flory" distribution of 1-olefins. More recently catalysts have emerged that selectively produce only 1-hexene by a distinctive trimerisation mechanism. Typically the final distribution of 1-olefins produced is of importance commercially.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst suitable for polymerising or oligomerising monomers, for example, olefrns, cycloolefms or diolefms, and especially for polymerising or oligomerising ethylene alone or propylene alone, or for copolymerising ethylene with higher 1-olefins with high activity. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the polymerisation of olefins. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide novel complexes based on certain transition rnetals. The catalysts described here show extremely high activity for polymerisation and oligomerisation which leads to many benefits "including lower catalyst loadings in a commercial process and lower catalyst residues in the final product.<br>

is 2 if all X groups are monoanionic groups (e.g. chloride).<br><br>
The optional activator (2) for the catalyst of the present invention is suitably selected from organoaluminium compounds and organoboron compounds or mixtures thereof. Examples of organoaluminium compounds include trialkyaluminium compounds,, for example, trimethylaluminium, triethyl aluminium, tributylaluminmm, tri-n-octylaluminium, ethylalurninium dichloride, diethylaluminium chloride, tris(pentafluorophenyl)aluminium and ahimoxanes. Alumoxanes are well known in the art as typically the oligomeric compounds which can be prepared by the controlled addition of water to an alkylaluminium compound, for example uimethylaluminium. Such compounds can be linear, cyclic or mixtures thereof. Commercially available alumoxanes are generally believed to be mixtures of linear, cyclic and cage compounds. The cyclic alumoxanes can be represented by the formula [R16A1O]S and the linear alumoxanes by the formula R17(RI8A10)S wherein s is a number from about 2 to 50, and wherein R16, R17, and R18 represent hydrocarbyl groups, preferably GI to Ce alkyl groups, for example methyl, ethyl or butyl groups.<br>
Examples of suitable organoboron compounds are<br>
dimethylphenylammomumtetra(phenyl)borate, trityltetra(phenyl)borate, triphenylboron, dimethylphenylammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate, sodium tetrakis[(bis-3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate5H+(OEt2)[(bis-355-trifluoromethyl)pheny]]borate, trityltetra(pentafluorophenyl)borateand tris(pentafluorophenyl) boron. Mixtures of organoaluminium compounds and organoboron compounds may be used.<br>
In the preparation of the catalysts of the present invention the quantity of activating compound selected from organoaluminium compounds and organoboron compounds to be employed is easily determined by simple testing, for example, by the preparation of small test samples which can be used to polymerise small quantities of the monomer(s) and thus to determine the activity of the produced catalyst. It is generally found that the quantity employed is sufficient to provide 0.1 to 20,000 atoms, preferably 1 to   2000   atoms of aluminium or boron per atom of M present in the compound of Formula A. Mixtures -of different activating compounds may be used. EP123 8989 discloses the use of activators (Lewis acids) selected from (b-1) ionic-bonding compounds having a CdCfe type or a CdI2 type of layered crystal structure;<br>
(b-2) clays, clay minerals, or ion-exchange layered compounds; (b-3) heteropoly-compounds; and (b-4) halogenated lanthanoid compounds.<br>
The activator employed in the present invention may be of the type disclosed in EP1238989 if desired. Such Lewis acids are those compounds which capable of receiving at least one electron pair and is capable of forming an ion pair by reaction with the transition metal complex. The Lewis acid includes the afore-mentioned (b-1) ionic-bonding compounds having a layered crystal structure of a CdCl2 type or Cdk type (b-2) clay. clay minerals, or ion-exchange layered compounds, (b-3) heteropoly compounds, and (b-4) halogenated lanthanoid compounds. The Lewis acid further includes SiOa, A12C&gt;3, natural and synthetic zeolites which have Lewis acid points formed by heating or a like treatment, and complexes and mixtures thereof.<br>
US Patent 6399535 discloses a coordinating catalyst system capable of polymerizing olefins comprising:<br>
(I) as a pre-catalyst, at least one non-metallocene, non-constrained geometry, bidentate ligand containing transition metal compound or tridentate ligand containing transition metal compound capable of (A) being activated upon contact with the catalyst support-activator agglomerate of (II) or (B) being converted, upon contact with an organometallic compound, to an intermediate capable of being activated upon contact with the catalyst support-activator agglomerate of (II), wherein the transition metal is at least one member selected from Groups 3 to 10 of the Periodic table; in intimate contact with<br>
(H) catalyst support-activator agglomerate comprising a composite of (A) at least one inorganic oxide component selected from SiO2, A12O3, MgO, A1PO4, TiO2, ZrO2, and CfoOa and (B) at least one ion containing layered material having interspaces between the layers and sufficient Lewis acidity, when present within the catalyst support-activator agglomerate, to activate the pre-catalyst when the pre-catalyst is in contact with the catalyst support-activator agglomerate, said layered material having a cationic component and an anionic component, wherein said cationic component is present within the interspaces of the layered material, said layered material being intimately associated with said inorganic oxide component within the agglomerate in an amount sufficient to improve the activity of the coordinating catalyst system for polymeri2ing 5thylene monomer, expressed as Kg of polyethylene per gram of catalyst system per hour, relative to the activity of a corresponding catalyst system employing ihe same pre-catalyst but in the absence of either Component A or B'of the catalyst support-activator agglomerate; wherein the amounts of the pre-catalyst and catalyst support-activator agglomerate which are in intimate contact are sufficient to provide a ratio of micromoles of pre-catalyst to grams of catalyst support-activator agglomerate of from about 5:1 to about 500:1. The layered material can be, for example, a smectite clay. The catalyst system of the present invention can be employed with a catalyst support-activator agglomerate as described in US 6399535 if desired.<br>
Li addition to the activator compound, it can be advantageous to employ catalytic quantities of certain halogenated compounds that are capable of promoting catalyst activity. Promotors of this type are especially useful in the case that the transition metal in the complex is vanadium. US Patent.5191042 discloses that certain vanadium-based catalysts activated with organoaluminium compounds can be promoted<br>
using a variety of halogenated organic compounds, for example, carbon tetrachloride, hexachloroethylene, benzylbromide, benzylchloride and 2,3- or 1,3-dichloropropylene. Other examples of halogenated organic compounds that can be used in this manner are ethyl,trichloroacetate, chloroform (CHC13) and n-butylchloride. US Patent.5191042 also, refers to the disclosure of Cooper (T. A Cooper, Journ. Am. Chem. Soc., 4158 (1973), which defines in Table 1 an organic halide activity index based on the ability of the halide to oxidize certain vanadium compounds under standard conditions. For example, carbon tetrachloride is assigned a reactivity of 1 in tetrahydrofuran at 20 °C., and other listed halogenated organic compounds have reactivities of from about 0.02 to greater than 200 relative to carbon tetrachloride. When it is desired, to use a halogenated promoter, it is preferred to use those having a Cooper Index ranging from about 0.01 up to about 30. The use of such promoters, especially in combination with vanadium-based catalysts is generally well known in the art, and for details of use of the such promoters reference may be made to US Patent.5191042 and to other prior art in this field. In the present invention it is possible to employ any halogenated organic compound as a promoter, but the compounds mentioned above are preferred.<br>

The catalyst of the present invention can, if desired, be utilised on a support material. Suitable support materials are, for example, silica, alumina, or zirconia, magnesia, magnesium chloride or a polymer or prepolymer, for example polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly(aminostyrene).<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can if desired comprise more than one of the defined transition metal compounds.<br>
hi addition to said one or more defined transition metal compounds, the catalysts of the present invention can also include one or more other catalysts for polymerising 1-olefins. Preferably such catalysts are other types of transition metal compounds or catalysts, for example, transition metal compounds of the type used in conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, metallocene-based catalysts, or heat activated supported chromium oxide catalysts (eg Phillips-type catalyst). The catalysts of the present invention may also used in conjunction with other catalysts producing only 1-olefins, either inside or outside the polymerisation reactor, and in this way make copolymers of ethylene orpropylene and these 1-olefins. Suitable catalysts for producing 1-olefins may produce only 1-butene, only 1-hexene or a distribution (for example, a Schulz-Flory distribution) of 1-olefins.<br>
If desired the catalysts can be formed in situ in the presenpe of the support material, or the support material can be pre-impregnated or premixed, simultaneously or sequentially, with one or more of the catalyst components. The catalysts cf the present invention can if desired be supported on a heterogeneous catalyst, for example, a magnesium halide supported Ziegler Natta catalyst, a Phillips type (chromium oxide) supported catalyst or a supported metallocene catalyst. Formation of the supported catalyst can be achieved for example by treating the transition metal compounds of the present invention with alumoxane in a suitable inert diluent, for example a volatile hydrocarbon, slurrying a particulate support material with the product and evaporating the volatile diluent. The produced supported catalyst is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder. The quantity of support material employed can vary widely, for example from 100,000 to 1 grams per gram of metal present in the transition metal compound.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of 1-olefins, cycloolefins or dienes, comprising contacting the<br>
monomer under polymerisation conditions with the polymerisation catalyst of the present invention.<br>
Suitable monomers for use in making homopolymers using the polymerisation process of the present invention are, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, hexene, styrene or conjugated or non-conjugated dienes. Preferred monomers are ethylene and propylene.<br>
Suitable monomers for use in making copolymers using the polymerisation process of the present invention are ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methylpentene-1,1-octene, norbornene, substituted norbomenes, dienes, egbutadiene, ethylidene norbornene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and styrene.<br>
A particularly preferred process in accordance with the present invention is the copolymerisation of ethylene and or propylene with comonomers selected from 1-olefins, acrylic acid esters, vinyl esters and vinyl aromatic compounds. Examples of suitable comonomers are 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methylpentene-l, methyl methacrylate,' methyl acrylate, butyl .acrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and styrene.<br>
Preferred polymerisation processes are the hornopolymerisation of ethylene or the hornopolymerisation of propylene or copolymerisation of ethylene with one or more of propylene, butene, hexene-1 and 4-methylpentene-l or copolymerisation of propylene with one or more of ethylene or butene.<br>
The polymerisation conditions can be, for example, bulk phase, solution phase, slurry phase or gas phase. If desired, the catalyst can be used to polymerise ethylene under high pressure/high temperature process conditions wherein the polymeric material forms as a melt in supercritical ethylene. Preferably the polymerisation is conducted under gas phase fhridised or stirred bed conditions.<br>
Slurry phase polymerisation conditions or gas phase polymerisation conditions are particularly useful for the production of high-density grades of polyethylene. In these processes the polymerisation conditions can be batch, continuous or semi-continuous. In the slurry phase process and the gas phase process, the catalyst is generally fed to the polymerisation zone in the form of a particulate solid. This solid can be, for example, an undiluted solid catalyst system formed from the complex A and an activator, or can be the solid complex A alone. In the latter situation, the activator<br>
can be fed to the polymerisation zone, for example as a solution, separately from or together with the solid complex. Preferably the catalyst system or the transition metal complex component of the catalyst system employed in the slurry polymerisation and gas phase polymerisation is supported on a support material. Most preferably the catalyst system is supported on a support material prior to its introduction into the polymerisation zone. Suitable support materials are, for example, silica, alumina, zirconia, talc, kieselguhr, magnesia, magnesium chloride and polymers. Impregnation of the support material can be carried out by conventional techniques, for example, by forming a solution or suspension of the catalyst components in a suitable diluent or solvent, and slurrying the support material therewith. The support material thus impregnated with catalyst can then be separated from the diluent for example, by filtration or evaporation techniques.<br>
In the slurry phase polymerisation process the solid particles of catalyst, or supported catalyst, are fed to a polymerisation zone either as dry powder or as a slurry in the polymerisation diluent. Preferably the particles are fed to a polymerisation zone as a suspension in the polymerisation diluent. The polymerisation zone can be, for example, an autoclave or similar reaction vessel, or a continuous loop reactor, e.g. of the type well know in the manufacture of polyethylene by the Phillips Process. When the polymerisation process of the present invention is carried out under slurry conditions the polymerisation is preferably carried out at a temperature above 0°C, most preferably above 15°C. The polymerisation temperature is preferably maintained below the temperature at which the polymer commences to soften or sinter in the presence of the polymerisation diluent. If the temperature is allowed to go above the latter temperature, fouling of the reactor can occur. Adjustment of the polymerisation within these defined temperature ranges can provide a useful means of controlling the average molecular weight of the producedpolymer. A further useful means of controlling the molecular weight is to conduct the polymerisation in the presence of hydrogen gas which acts as chain transfer agent. Generally, the higher the .concentration of hydrogen employed, the lower the average molecular weight of the produced polymer.<br>
The use of hydrogen gas as a means of controlling the average molecular weight of the polymer or copolymer applies generally to the polymerisation process of the present invention. For example, hydrogen can be used to reduce the average molecular<br>
weight of polymers or copolymers prepared using gas phase, slurry phase or solution phase polymerisation conditions. The quantity of hydrogen gas to be employed to give the desired average molecular weight can be determined by simple "trial and error" polymerisation tests.<br>
Methods for operating gas phase polymerisation processes are well known in the art. Such methods generally involve agitating (e.g. by stirring, vibrating or fluidising) a bed of catalyst, or a bed of the target polymer (i.e. polymer having the same or similar physical properties to that which it is desired to make in the polymerisation process) containing a catalyst, and feeding thereto a stream of monomer at least partially in the gaseous phase, under conditions such that at least part of the monomer polymerises in contact with the catalyst in the bed. The bed is generally cooled by the addition of cool gas (eg recycled gaseous monomer) and/or volatile liquid (eg a volatile inert hydrocarbon, or gaseous monomer which has been condensed to form a liquid). The polymer produced in, and isolated from, gas phase processes forms directly a solid in the polymerisation zone and is free from, orsubstantially free from liquid. As is well known to those skilled in the art, if any liquid is allowed to enter the polymerisation zone of a gas phase polymerisation process the quantity of liquid is small in relation to the quantity of polymer present in the polymerisation zone. This is in contrast to "solution phase" processes wherein the polymer is formed dissolved in a solvent, and "slurry phase" processes wherein the polymer forms as a suspension in a liquid diluent.<br>
The gas phase process can be operated under batch, semi-batch, or so-called "continuous" conditions. It is preferred to operate under conditions such that monomer is continuously recycled to an agitated polymerisation zone containing polymerisation catalyst, make-up monomer being provided to replace polymerised monomer, and continuously or intermittently withdrawing produced polymer from the polymerisation zone at a rate comparable to the rate of formation of the polymer, fresh catalyst being added to the polymerisation zone to replace the catalyst withdrawn form the polymerisation zone with the produced polymer.<br>
When using the catalysts of the present invention under gas phase polymerisation conditions, the catalyst, or one or more of the components employed to form the catalyst can, for example, be introduced into the polymerisation reaction zone in liquid form, for example, as a solution in an inert liquid diluent. Thus, for example,<br>
the transition metal component, or the activator component, or both of these components can be dissolved or slurried in a liquid diluent and fed to the polymerisation zone. Under these circumstances it is preferred the liquid containing the component(s) is sprayed as fine droplets into the polymerisation zone. The droplet diameter is preferably within the range 1 to 1000 microns. EP-A-0593083, the teaching of which is hereby incorporated into this specification, discloses a process for introducing a polymerisation catalyst into a gas phase polymerisation. The methods disclosed in EP-A-0593083 can be suitably employed in the polymerisation process of the present invention if desired.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the oligomerisation and cooligomerisation of 1-olefins, comprising contacting the monomeric olefin under oligomerisation conditions with the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
Suitable monomers for use in making homooligomers using the oligomerisation process of the of the present invention are, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, hexene, and styrene. The preferred monomer is ethylene.<br>
Suitable monomers for use in making co-oligomers using the oligomerisation process of the present invention are ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and further 1-olefins of the series C(n)H(2n) where n is an integer.<br>
There exist a number of options for the oligomerisation reactor including batch, semi- batch, and continuous operation. The oligomerisation and co-oligornerisation reactions of the present invention can be performed under a range of process conditions that are readily apparent to those skilled in the art: as a homogeneous liquid phase reaction in the presence or absence of an inert hydrocarbon diluent such as toluene or heptanes; as a two-phase liquid/liquid reaction; as a slurry process where the catalyst is in a form that displays little or no solubility; as a bulk process in which essentially neat reactant and/or product olefins serve as the dominant medium; as a gas-phase process in which at least a portion of the reactant or product olefin(s) are transported to or from a supported form of the catalyst via the gaseous state. Evaporative cooling from one or more monomers or inert volatile liquids is but one method that can be employed to effect the removal of heat from the reaction. The (co-)oligomerisation reactions may be performed in the known types of gas-phase reactors, such as circulating bed, vertically or horizontally stirred-bed, fixed-bed, or fluidised-bed reactors, liquid-phase reactors,<br>
such as plug-flow, continuously stirred tank, or loop reactors, or combinations thereof. A wide range of methods for effecting product, reactant, and catalyst separation and/or purification are known to those skilled in the art and may be employed: distillation, filtration, liquid-liquid separation, slurry settling, extraction, etc. One or more of these methods may be performed separately from the (co-)oligomerisation reaction or it may be advantageous to integrate at least some with'a (co-)oligomerisation reaction; a non-limiting example of this would be a process employing catalytic (or reactive) distillation. Also advantageous may be a process which includes more than one reactor, a catalyst kill system between reactors or after the final reactor, or an integrated reactdr/separator/purifier. While all catalyst components, reactants, inerts, and products could be employed in the present invention on a once-through basis, it is often economically advantageous to recycle one or more of these materials; in the case of the catalyst system, this might require reconstituting one or more of the catalysts components to achieve the active catalyst system. It is within the scope of this invention that a (co)oligomerisation product might-also serve as a reactant (e.g. 1-hexene, produced via the oligomerisation of ethylene, might be converted to decene products via a subsequent co-oligomermerisation reaction with two further ethylene units).<br>
The catalyst systems of the present invention can present a variety of advantages over the prior art systems. In general the catalysts are easy to synthesise, have high activity and good catalyst life when employed under conventional industrial . polymerisation conditions. Generally the catalysts exhibit single site behaviour which tends to favour the production of narrow molecular weight distribution polymers having uniform properties. Generally, the vanadium based catalysts of the present invention are capable of making very high molecular weight polymers.<br>

The ethylene oligpmerisation/polymerisation tests were carried out using the following<br>
procedure.<br>
Preparation of solution of activated catalyst. The required amount of catalyst precursor<br>
Cr-1 (0.5 — 5 mg) was suspended in 20—100 ml toluene followed by the addition of the<br>

The ethylene oligomerisation/polymerisation reactions were usually carried out in a 400<br>
ml "Fischer-Porter" glass reactor equipped with a gas inlet, a catalyst inlet, a mechanical<br>
stirrer and a digital thermometer. An aliquot of 1-5 ml of the catalyst solution described<br>
above was added to the reactor containing 200 — 300 ml solvent (usually toluene) and<br>
0.1 — 5 mmol scavenger (usually trisobutyl aluminium - TIBAL or MAO). The reactor<br>
was then connected to the ethylene gas supply at the desired pressure and the<br>
temperature brought to the required value. The reaction was carried out for JO - 120 min (usually 60 min). The reaction mixture was then quickly cooled down to room temperature (if necessary) and the reaction terminated by venting the ethylene off. GC (Gas Chromatography) samples were always withdrawn and analysed in order to determine the molecular-weight distribution of the C4-C40 olefms. The reactor content was then poured into a beaker containing 400 ml methanol and a few drops of 2M HCL. The precipitated polymer was filtered, washed with methanol and dried at 60°C under<br>
vacuum.<br><br>

Ethylene homopolymerisation with V-1 .<br>
The ethylene homopolymerisation tests-were carried out using a procedure similar to that described in Example 3-11. Solution of activated catalyst:<br>
The required amount of catalyst precursor V-1 (0.5 - 5 mg) was suspended in 20-100 ml toluene followed by the addition of the co-catalyst (DEAC - diethyl aluminium chloride or DMAC - diethylaluminium chloride - 0.1 - 10 mmol). Thus prepared solution can be used immediately or stored at 0°C for a number of days. Ethylene polymerisation<br>
The ethylene polymerisation reactions were carried out either in a 400 ml "Fischer-Porter" glass reactor (FPR) equipped with a gas inlet, a catalyst inlet, a mechanical stirrer and a digital thermometer or in a 1L stainless-steel reactor (SSR) equipped with an integral system for control of reaction temperature, ethylene pressure and ethylene flow. An aliquot of 1-5 ml of the catalyst solution described above was injected in the reactor containing 200 - 300 (FPR) or 400- 800 (SSR) ml solvent (usually toluene, n-hexane, n-heptane or isobutane), 0.1-2 mmol scavenger (usually DMAC) and 10 —60 umol reactivator (usually ethyl trichloroacetate - ETA or another chlorinated compound as chloroform). The reactor was then connected to the ethylene gas supply at the desired pressure and the temperature brought quickly to the required value. The reaction was<br><br>
carried out for 10 — 120 min (usually 60 min). The reaction mixture was then cooled down to room temperature (if necessary) and the reaction terminated by venting the ethylene off. If toluene was used as a polymerisation medium, the reactor content was then poured into a beaker containing 400 ml methanol and a few drops of 2M HCI. The polymer was filtered, washed with .methanol (if necessary) and dried at 60°C under vacuum.<br>
