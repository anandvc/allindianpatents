				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyurethane in spherical particle form-with controlled particle size_and shape. More particularly it relates to the production of polyurethane microspheres from a diol and diisocyanate by dispersion polymerization in presence of a steric stabilizer particularly a polycondensable macromonomer having formula (I) in the drawing accompanying the specification.<br>
Polyurethane particulates obtained by this invention are suitable for a wide variety of useful applications such as coatings, adhesives and also an encapsulant material for pigments, agrochemicals, drugs and reactive chemicals like curing agents.<br>
In prior art, polyurethane powders are prepared by cryogenic grinding or extrusion and<br>
granulation of thermoplastic polyurethanes. (U.S.Pat. 3214411; JP-02-124978). JP 03-	'<br>
181526 discloses a process for producing polyurethane microparticles by dissolving polyurethane resin in amino alcohol at 130 to 150°C followed by cooling, filtering and drying under vacuum. In another method (JP 04-248875), hydroxyl and/or amino group containing resin is reacted with blocked isocyanates in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature. The solvent is femoved under reduced pressure. The polyurethane powder obtained is filtered and dried. These techniques however, do not yield polyurethane powder in controlled particle size and shape.<br>
Spherical polyurethane particles are prepared by suspension polymerization of an isocyanate terminated prepolymer in aqueous or non-aqueous medium. U.S.Pat. 4083831 describes oil in water suspension polycondensation technique wherein an isocyanate<br>
terminated prepolymer is suspended in aqueous media. The reaction proceeds in aqueous medium and produces polyurethane urea powder which is stabilized by a combination of anionic and homopolymeric stabilizers. In an another variant, polyurethane spherical particles are obtained by suspension polycondensation in non- aqueous media (U.S. Pat. 4032516). In this art, the isocyanate terminated prepolymer is suspended in paraffin oil using sodium dodecylsulfosuccinate as a stabilizer. The chain extension was carried out with 1,4-butane diol in n-heptane and in the presence of an amphiphilic block copolymer namely 1-hexadecane vinylpyrrolidone as steric stabilizer.<br>
Stabilization of polyurethane spherical particles in aqueous and non-aqueous medium is known in the prior art. For instance, JP 04-225755; JP 03-31359 and JP 04-202311 describes the use of a stabilizer derived from polycaprolactone, polybutadiene and isophrone diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane powder in n-heptane. In yet another application JP 02-38453 discloses the preparation of stabilizers derived from poly (butylene adipate), maleic anhydride and lauryl methacrylate. In addition to these block copolymers, protective colloids such as polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, gelatin, sodium alkyl sulfate are also employed to stabilize polyurethane microspheres (JP 04-161416).<br>
Polyurethane spherical particles obtained by this prior art are polydisperse and their size ranging between 1 and 1000 p. even at higher stabilizer concentrations. Furthermore, none of the application uses diol and diisocyanate directly. Instead, an isocyanate terminated prepolymer is used to produce polyurethane microspheres.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing polyurethane microspheres with controlled particle size from a diol and a diisocyanate.<br>
Another object of this invention is to stabilize polyurethane particles using a polycodensable macromonomer, particularly a macrodiol, which is enchained in the polymer backbone and stabilizes the polyurethane particles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to produce polyurethane particles of size ranging from 100 nm to 1000 fa by varying the concentration of the stabilizer.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of polyurethane spherical particles of size ranging from l00nm to l000microns, which comprises reacting a diel and an organic diisocyanate and optionally a multifunctional hydroxyl compound in presence of a polycondensable macro monomer such as herein<br>
described and a catalyst such a herein described an organic solvent under stirring condition and agitator speed of 200-800rpm at temperatures ranging from 40 to 100°C for a period ranging between 2 and 12 hours, separating the spherical polyurethane particles from the reaction mixture by conventional methods to get the desireffproduct.<br>

The amount of macrodiol varies from 1 to 25 percent, preferably from 3 to 18 percent based on the total quantity of urethane forming reactants.

The polymerization can be carried out in any conventional resin reactor equipped with a cooling jacket, a double walled condenser, a thermowell, an inlet tube for nitrogen gas purging and an addition funnel for monomer feeding. Stirring can be done by using any conventional stirring device. The agitator speed may be in between 200 and 800 revolutions per minute (rpm). The polymerization reaction can be carried out between 40°C and 100°C and more preferably between 60°C and 90°C. The reaction time is typically between 3 and 10 hours. The conversion of isocyanate is in the range between 82 and 100 percent. The polyurethane microspheres formed at the end of the reaction is washed thoroughly with a low boiling aliphatic hydrocarbon particularly hexane and dried at room temperature under vacuum. The particle size of the polyurethane microsphere ranges from 150 nm to 500 µ. depending on the concentration of the macrodiol stabilizer.<br>
