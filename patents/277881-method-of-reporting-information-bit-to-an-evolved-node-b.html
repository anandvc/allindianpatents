				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of wireless telecommunication. The invention, more specifically, applies to the Data Link Layer (also known was Layer 2) in the Access Stratum of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of the 3G UMTS (WCDMA) Protocol Standards.<br>
The invention specifies a method for the UE to report an information bit, called 'Happy Bit', to the eNB for avoiding a potential starvation of lower priority services. More particularly, the present invention relates to a System and Method for user equipment to report information bit to eNB.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
When an Uplink Channel is shared by many UEs, a scheduler entity is required at the eNB to allocate the resources to the competing UEs on this channel. There are two methods of scheduling the UEs on a Shared Uplink Channel viz. (a) Fixed Allocation and (b) Dynamic Allocation.<br>
The Fixed Allocation is applied to the services whose QoS requirements are determined / negotiated at the setup time. In this case, the allocation the service (Radio Bearer) remains fixed during the lifetime of the service (Radio Bearer). However, this kind of allocation scheme is not suitable for the services which have variable bandwidth requirements. Dynamic allocation is used for such services (Radio Bearers).<br>
In case of Dynamic Allocation, only the upper and lower limits for the QoS requirements of a service are determined / negotiated at the setup time. The actual QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer are regularly reported (called Buffer Status) to the eNB and the eNB is responsible to satisfy those requirements according to negotiated QoS parameters.<br>
Based on the Buffer Status Report(s) received from the UE(s) and the priorities of the UE(s) and their corresponding active service(s) (Radio Bearer(s)), the eNB Scheduler determines the allocation(s) for the UE(s) for the upcoming TTI.<br>
The allocation(s) is (are) indicated to the UE(s) which is (are) responsible for distributing the received allocation among their respective competing service(s) (Radio Bearer(s)). The UE(s) is (are) required to maximize the transfer of the highest priority data and this condition has to be satisfied recursively for the other priority levels.<br>
For the Dynamic Allocation, it is possible that the allocations received by a UE are not able to meet the minimum QoS requirements for all of its active services (Radio Bearers). This could be due to:<br>
(a)	The UE receiving less allocation than requested/required, or<br>
(b)	A potential competition among the Radio Bearers with different traffic priorities.<br>
The scenario (a) is self-evident. If the UE does not receive the requested/required allocation it cannot meet the minimum QoS requirements for all its active services (Radio Bearers).<br>
The scenario (b) is possible in cases when the QoS requirements are updated (increased) during the time interval since the reporting of the Buffer Status to the reception of the actual allocation. In this case, since the UE is required to satisfy the services (Radio Bearers) in the priority order, the QoS of the lower priority service(s) (Radio Bearer(s)) may or may not be met every TTI.<br>
It is critical for all services that their minimum QoS requirements are met on a regular basis. However, no mechanism exists currently whereby the UE could inform the eNB the QoS requirements of some of the services are not being met.<br>
The existing Release-6 HSPA mechanism allows for a UE to inform the Node-B about this condition but the existing information content (also called 'happy bit') does not provide any specific knowledge except that the UE could have transmitted more data than allowed in last TTI. Therefore, the eNB scheduling decisions are restricted by the coarse granularity of the information provided by the UE.<br>
The patent publication no. "W02004045120A1" relates to Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms in wireless Local Area Networking (LAN) communication systems. More particularly, it relates to management of multiple priority queues in wireless communications systems so as to ensure that lower priority traffic is not restricted to access the medium during sustained periods of higher priority traffic being sent. However, the patent publication does not explicitly describe the concept of including an information bit (happy bit) with the buffer status report.<br>
The patent publication no. US6442172B1 relates to digital LAN and WAN traffic switches, particularly asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches. The patent publication also describes about the buffer status with a single bit to the transmitter. However, the patent publication does not explicitly describe the concept of including an information bit with the buffer status report and avoiding starvation of low priority services.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of wireless telecommunication. The invention, more specifically, applies to the data link layer (also known as layer 2) in the access stratum of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of the 3G UMTS (WCDMA) protocol standards. In dynamic allocation scheduling method, the upper and lower limits for the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of a service are determined / negotiated at the setup time. The actual QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer are regularly reported (called Buffer Status) to the evolved node B (eNB) and the eNB is responsible to satisfy those requirements according to negotiated QoS parameters.<br>
Based on the Buffer Status Report received from the UE and the priorities of the UE and its corresponding active services (Radio Bearer), the eNB Scheduler determines the allocation for the UE for the upcoming Transmission Time Interval (TTI). The allocation is indicated to the UE which is responsible for distributing the received allocation among its respective competing services (Radio Bearer). The UE is required to maximize the transfer of the highest priority data and this condition has to be satisfied recursively for the other priority levels. For the Radio Bearers served with the Dynamic Allocation, an information bit ('happy bit') shall be added per TTI in the corresponding Buffer Status Report. This information bit ('happy bit') shall indicate if the Radio Bearer in question was 'happy' with received allocation in the previous TTI i.e. the happy bit will determine if the allocation received in the last TTI was sufficient to meet the minimum QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer in question. The eNB Scheduler shall use and consider this information while taking the scheduling decision.<br>
An information bit ('happy bit') per Buffer Status Reporting Unit* per TTI shall be added in the Buffer Status Report. This will indicate whether the Buffer Status Reporting Unit was 'happy' with received allocation in the previous TTI.<br>
The eNB Scheduler shall use and consider this information while taking the scheduling decision(s). For the purpose of reporting the 'happy bit', a particular service shall be deemed to be unhappy in a TTI if the received allocation is not able to meet even its minimum QoS requirements.<br>
* Three types of buffer reporting schemes are possible: per RB, per RB group and per UE. The granularity of the 'happy bit' shall be same as that of the Buffer Status Report. However, it has been assumed, for the purpose of illustrations, that the reporting is done on a per RB basis.<br>
Accordingly the invention explain a method for reporting information bit to eNB wherein based on the Buffer Status Report received from the UE and the priorities of the UE and its corresponding active services (Radio Bearer), the eNB Scheduler determines the allocation for the UE for the upcoming Transmission Time Interval (TTI).<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a system for reporting information bit to eNB wherein based on the Buffer Status Report received from the UE and the priorities of the UE and its corresponding active services (Radio Bearer), the eNB Scheduler determines the allocation for the UE for the upcoming Transmission Time Interval (TTI).<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts Dynamic Allocation: H=Happy, U=Unhappy<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
There are two methods of scheduling the UEs on a Shared Uplink Channel:<br>
-	Fixed Allocation<br>
-	Dynamic Allocation.<br>
In case of Dynamic Allocation, only the upper and lower limits for the QoS requirements of a service are determined / negotiated at the setup time. The actual QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer are regularly reported (called Buffer Status) to the eNB and the eNB is responsible to satisfy those requirements according to negotiated QoS parameters.<br>
Based on the Buffer Status Report(s) received from the UE(s) and the priorities of the UE(s) and their corresponding active service(s) (Radio Bearer(s)), the eNB<br>
Scheduler determines the allocation(s) for the UE(s) for the upcoming TTI.<br>
/<br>
The allocation(s) is (are) indicated to the UE(s) which is (are) responsible for distributing the received allocation among their respective competing service(s) (Radio Bearer(s)). The UE(s) is (are) required to maximize the transfer of the highest priority data and this condition has to be satisfied recursively for the other priority levels.<br>
For the Radio Bearers served with the Dynamic Allocation, an information bit ('happy bit') shall be added per TTI in the corresponding Buffer Status Report. This information bit ('happy bit') shall indicate if the Radio Bearer in question was 'happy' with received allocation in the previous TTI.<br>
That is to say, this bit will determine if the allocation received in the last TTI was sufficient to meet the minimum QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer in question. The eNB Scheduler shall use and consider this information while taking the scheduling decision(s).<br>
As depicted in the Figure 1, the Radio Bearer 1 and 2 have a total of 2 and 3 PDUs to transmit. Since this is the first TTI, both of them report the Buffer Status (2X and 3Y, assuming the PDU sizes of X and Y respectively) with the 'Happy Bit' set to '1' (=H==Happy). However, the allocation received from the eNB (and re¬distributed by the UE) result into both being allowed to transmit 2 PDUs each.<br>
The QoS requirements of the Radio Bearer 1 are met and it is happy whereas those of the Radio Bearer 2 are not met and it is not happy. This shall be reflected in their corresponding Buffer Status Report headers where the 'Happy Bit' shall be set to '1' (=H==Happy) and '0' (=U==Unhappy) respectively. The eNB Scheduler is supposed to consider this information while taking the scheduling decision(s) in the next TTI.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The main advantage gained from this innovation is the ability to avoid the starvation of a lower priority (QoS) service.<br>
It is appreciated that the co-operation of the eNB Scheduler is required to avoid the starvation. The details of this co-operation, apart from, as covered in this IPR viz. the UE reporting the buffer status with a 'happy bit' and the eNB Scheduler taking care of any potential starvation, are out of the scope of this IPR.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
