PREPABATION OF QUINONEDIIMINES FROM PHENYLENEDIAMINES USING OXYGEN AND A METAL OR METAL SALT CATALYST<br>
This application claims priority to the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application 60/087,754, filed June 2, 1998,<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing quinonediimines from their corresponding phenylenediamines using oxygen and a metal catalyst or a salt of a metal catalyst.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The class of cyclic enones is well known in organic chemistry. Best known examples of cyclic enones axe quinones such as, for example, the benzoquinones, naphthoquinones, anthraquinones, phenanthraquinones, and the like. 1,4-Benzoquinone is commonly referred to as quinone. Quinones are generally brightly colored compounds and have versatile applications in chemical synthesis, biological uses, as redox materials, as well as in industry. There are several review articles on the chemistry and applications of quinones including, for  example,  Xiric-Othmer Encyclopedia     of     Chemical<br>
Technolo'r    Third ed. , Vol. 19, pages 572-605, John<br>
Wiley Sc Sons, New York, 1982. The synthesis of quinones is well documented. See, for example, J. Cason, Synthesis    of   Benzoquinones   by   Oxidation,     in Organic<br>
Synthesisr   Vol. IV, page  305, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New<br>
York (1948) . Quinones generally are prepared by oxidizing the appropriately disubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives, the substituents being hydroxyl<br><br>
or amino groups in the ortho or para positions. 1,4-benzoguinone, for example, can be made from the oxidation of hydroguinone, p-aminophenol or p-phenylenediamine, or from quinic acid. The reagents generally used for the oxidation are dichromate/sulfuric acid mixture, ferric chloride, silver (II) oxide or eerie ammonium nitrate. In these cases, oxidation of the aminoaromatic compound is accompanied by hydrolysis to the corresponding quinone. Some processes may take several hours for completion of the reaction.<br>
Thus, certain prior art processes utilize a catalytic agent to achieve an acceptable reaction while other processes proceed without catalysts. The process according to the present invention utilizes a metal or metal salt oxidation catalyst which provides high conversion and reaction rates to prepare the quinonediimine.<br>
A prior art process, which utilizes a catalyst in the preparation of a quinoneimine compound, is disclosed by Desmurs, et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5, 18 9,218. The process of Desmurs, et al. , which converts N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)aniline into N-phenylbenzoquinone-imine, utilizes a manganese, copper, cobalt, and/or nickel compound as a catalyst in an oxidation type reaction. Although Desmurs, et al. identify converting the N-phenylbenzoquinone-imine into an N-phenyl-N' "cycloalkyl-2, 5-cyclohexadine-l, 4-diimine, Desmurs, et al. fails to recognize the use of an oxidation catalyst for the conversion, much less a metal oxidation catalyst, as used in the present invention. This IS evidenced by Desmurs, et al. suggestion at col. 5, lines 14-22, to use a hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
Other processes are known which use oxidizing agents  to  convert  phenylenediamines  into  their<br><br>
corresponding quinonediimines. For example, EP 708,081 (Bernhardt et al) , which describes the conversion of phenylenediamines to phenylenediimines by oxidation of the diamine in an alkali/alcoholic solution, gives a general description of such processes in its background. The EP '081 process suffers from various disadvantages including long reaction times and low yields.<br>
Additional oxidation conversion processes are described by Wheeler in U.S. Patent No, 5,118,80', by GB1,267,635 and by Haas et al, in EP 708,080. However, the use of oxygen along with a metal catalyst or salt of a metal catalyst in the conversion of phenylenediamine compounds to give highly selective yields of C[uinonediimine compounds has not heretofore been suggested.<br>
As such, the current invention is based on the problem of providing a simple and economic process for the preparation of quinonediimines in high yields and with high purity.<br>
Sxjitimary of the Invention<br>
It has been discovered that phenylenediamine compounds can be converted with extremely high selectivity into the corresponding quinonediimine by reaction of the diamine with metal catalyst, or a salt thereof, in the presence of oxygen. Conditions are revealed in which nearly quantitative yields have been obtained.<br>
In contrast to prior art, an advantage of the present invention is that the conversion of phenylenediamine to the corresponding quinonediimine is nearly quantitative. Thus, very little waste material remains upon completion of the reaction.<br><br>
An additional advantage is that the metal or metal salt catalytic agent, as set forth herein, provide an extremely high conversion, high selectivity and faster more complete reaction compared to prior art processes.<br>
Still further advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>

In the reaction, according to the present invention, the metal catalysts are typically transition metals from Groups IB, IIB, VB, VIB, VIIB, and VIII of the periodic table.  The metals may be in their ionic state or in the form of a metal salt.  The catalysts may be used alone or in blends.   Typically the metals include V, Nb,  Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, To, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Hg, and their salts. Supported catalysts such as Pd/C, Pt/C, Ni/Al, Ru/C, Rh/C and the like, are also included. Some examples of preferred catalysts include, but are not limited to, Pt/C, Pd/C, Rh/C, Ru/C, nickel {ID oxide, cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon, and silver oxide.<br>
The catalysts used in the present invention are typically present in amounts ranging from about 0.1 wt. % to about 20.0 wt %, based on the weight of the phenylenediamine starting material.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention cause the conversion reaction in the process according to the present invention. It is advantageous to utilize solid catalysts in the reaction according to the present invention as there is ease in recovery of the solid catalysts, via filtration, and the solid catalysts can be reused in the process. There are also advantages with respect to environmental containment, and there is less likelihood that there will be contamination by the catalyst in the final isolate of quinonediimine. Further, the catalysts give high conversion and excellent selectivity.<br>
The reaction, according to the present invention, takes place in either a homogeneous or two-phase solvent system. Water soluble organic solvents are used for the homogeneous reaction while water insoluble organic hydrocarbon solvents yield the two-<br><br>
phase system. The two-phase system also includes water. The two-phase oxidation system provides ease of separation of the organic components (both quinonediimine and solvent) from the spent aqueous layer. Organic aprotic solvents useable in the process of the present invention include, but are not limited to, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 4--methyl-2T-pentanone (methyl isobutyl ketone) , 5-'methyl-2-hexanone, methyl ethyl ketone; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexanes, heptanes, toluene, xylenes, nitriles such as acetonitrile; halogenated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride; water soluble solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, sulfolane, dimethylformamide; esters such as ethyl acetate; ethers such as 1, 4-dioxan, alcohols such as methanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
As with the catalysts, the solvents, when recovered from the product, may be recycled and reused in the reaction.<br>
When water is present in the reaction, it is typically present in amounts o' up to 75 wt %, based upon the weight of the total reaction mixture. Water can be present as the sole solvent or it can be combined with other water soluble or water insoluble organic solvents.<br>
When utilizing a water soluble salt of a metal catalyst in the reaction according to the present invention, it is desirable to utilize a two-phase solvent system. The use of a two-phase solvent system with the water soluble metal catalysts permits ease of separation of the catalyst from the desired end product as the end product is present in the organic phase while<br><br>
the catalyst is present in the aqueous phase. Once again, the catalyst and aqueous solvent can be recycled back into the reaction.<br>
The initial phenylenediamine concentration may range in amounts of from about 1% to 100% w/v. Preferably, the initial phenylenediamine concentration ranges from about 25% to about 60% w/v.<br>
The  present  reaction may  take  place  at<br>
temperatures from about 0°C to about 150°C, preferably<br>
from about 25°C to about 70°C.<br>
A phase-transfer catalyst may be utilized to accelerate the rate of reaction with the above mentioned metal catalysts- With water immiscible solvents it is advantageous to utilize a phase transfer catalyst to accelerate the rate of reaction in the process of the present invention.  Phase transfer catalysts useable in the present invention include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium salts, such as tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra alkyl ammonium halides, tetra-N-butyl ammonium  bromide,  tetra-N-butyl  ammonium  chloride, benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride; phosphonium salts such as bis [tris (dimethylamino)phosphine] iminium chloride; crown ethers and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The phase transfer catalyst can be added directly to the reaction mixture or it can be dissolved in one of the reagents such as phenylenediamine. The phase transfer catalyst may also be dissolved in a solvent used in the process or in water before addition to the reaction mass.<br>
Another means by which the rate of reaction may be increased is by increasing the stirring or mixing rate in the reaction.  By increasing the stirring or<br><br>
mixing, the reaction rate may be effectively adjusted to proceed at a faster pace when necessary.<br>
Other means of increasing the reaction rate include increasing the temperature of the reaction, increasing the pressure at which the reaction takes place and by increasing the amount of catalyst used.<br>
Additionally, the addition of • basic pH adjusting agents, such as triethylamine, can increase the reaction rate and also provide increased selectivity for the desired quinonediimine end product.<br>
Further, the reaction can utilize a combination of more than one phenylenediamine starting material to produce a product containing a mixture of quinonediimines.<br>
Also, the reaction may be stopped prior to completion thereby producing a product comprising a mixture of phenylenediamine and quinonediimine. By adjusting the amount of catalyst, adjusting the amount of pH adjusting agents, and/or adjusting the amount of oxygen present in the reaction, for example, one can obtain highly specific blends' of phenylenediamine and quinonediimine. Depending upon the particular use of the product, such blends may provide better results than a product with high amounts of quinonediimine.<br>
The present invention can be more clearly illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A  mixture  of  N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine (Santoflex® 6PPD,  5 g, 0.019 moles),<br>
methanol (200 mL) , triethylamine (2mL) , water (2mL) and<br>
catalyst was charged to an autoclave.  The reaction<br><br>
mixture was stirred and the autoclave purged with oxygen and then charged to 30 psig oxygen at 20-25 °C. The reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C and maintained at 5 0 °C until the reaction was complete. As the reaction progressed, the oxygen pressure dropped. When the pressure dropped to about 2 0 psig, more oxygen was charged to the reactor to bring the pressure hack to 3 0 psig. The reaction time was counted from the moment oxygen was initially charged to the autoclave. When very little or no oxygen uptake was detectable, the mixture was filtered to separate the catalyst.<br>
The reaction times and product composition of the resulting mixtures are tabulated in the following table. In most cases high conversions to the desired quinone-diimine product of N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediimine {6QDI) were obtained. In some reactions, the reaction was not complete and hence the mixture  indicated  presence  of  unreacted  starting<br>
material Santoflex® 6PPD. Simply further continuing the reaction can complete these reactions. When the catalyst is heterogeneous, the reaction mixture can be filtered to separate the product from the catalyst. Concentration of the filtered reaction mixture can lead to the desired product, 6QDI in very high yields.<br>
In the examples listed in the following table, the reaction mixture was analyzed when there was no more consumption of oxygen or very little uptake of oxygen thereby indicating completion of the reaction. However, this method of judging the completion of reaction was not always reliable. Hence, in some reactions, there was unreacted starting material present. At the same time, when reactions were fully complete, actual reaction time could be lower than listed in the table 1.<br>
Analysis indicated disappearance of Santoflex® 6PPD<br><br>
and formation of the corresponding guinone-diimme m high selectivity. The results of HPLC area % analysis are summarized in the following table 1.<br>
Catalysts used for the rxm numbers 1-4 had approximately 50% water. As such, on the dry weight basis, the weight of catalyst would be roughly half the amount. For example, 0.5 g would in turn be 0.25 g and so on.<br>
Various isolation techniques well known in the art may be used to isolate the product according to the present invention, such isolation techniques include, but are not limited to' filtration and concentration. The catalyst and solvent recovered from the reaction can be recycled and reused in subsequent reactions.<br><br>
A comparison of the following three examples indicates the advantages of adding pH adjusting agents, such as triethylamine, on the rate of reaction and the selectivity of the desired product 6QDI. In the following examples the weight of catalyst used is wet<br><br>
weight, which has about 50% water. Hence the dry weight of catalyst used would be half the amount. For example, in case of catalyst weight of 0.500 g, the dry weight of catalyst would be 0.25g and so on.<br>
These examples were done under identical conditions and the same raw materials were used in all the reactions to avoid variation from batch to batch and for better comparison. The reactions were not taken to full completion and hence HPLC analysis indicated presence of<br>
unreacted starting material Santoflex® 6PPD.   Simply<br>
further continuing the reaction can complete these reactions.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example teaches the effect of triethylamine to increase the rate of reaction and for better selectivity for the desired product quinone-diimine.<br>
In accordance with procedure set forth in Example 1,  a  mixture  of  N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N' -phenyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine  (Santoflex® 6PPD,    10.0 g,  0.038 moles) , methanol (200 mL) , triethylamine (2mL) , and catalyst, 3% Pt/C (O.SOOg), wa's charged to an autoclave. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples over a period of time and analyzing by HPLC for the<br>
product 6QDI and for the starting material Santoflex® 6PPD.  The following table 2 summarizes the results.<br><br><br>
Addition of triethylamine is helpful since the selectivity for the desired product 6QDI is very high and rate of reaction is exceptionally high too.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example teaches the effect of addition of triethylamine and water to increase the rate of reaction and for better selectivity for the desired product quinone-diimine.<br>
In accordance with procedure set forth in Example 1,  a  mixture  of  N-1, 3 -dimethylbutyl-N' -phenyl -p-<br>
phenylenediamine  (Santof lex® 6PPD,   10.0 g,  0.03 8<br>
moles) , methanol (200 mL) , triethylamine (2mL) , water (2mL) and catalyst, 3% Pt/C (0,500g), was charged to an autoclave. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples over a period of time and analyzing by HPLC for the product 6QDI and for the starting material<br>
Santoflex® SPPD.  The following table 3 summarizes the results-<br><br><br>
Addition of triethylamine and water is helpful since the selectivity for the desired product 6QDI is very high and rate of reaction is exceptionally high also. This example also indicates that water in the reaction does not have an adverse effect on the reaction.<br>
Example 4<br>
The reaction will proceed in the absence of a pH adjusting agent as demonstrated in the following example. In this manner, a product comprising a mixture of phenylenediamine and quinonediimine can be produced, or the reaction can be allowed to go to completion if desired.<br>
In accordance with procedure set forth in Example 1,  a  mixture  of  N-1, 3 -dimethylbutyl-N' -phenyl -p-<br>
phenylenediamine (Santoflex® 6PPD, 10.0 g, 0.038 moles), methanol (200 mL) , and catalyst, 3% Pt/C (O.BOOg), was charged to an autoclave. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples over a period of time and analyzing by HPLC for the product 6QDI and<br>
for  the  starting material  Santoflex®  6PPD.    The following table 4 summarizes the results.<br><br><br>
In this experiment, HPLC analysis indicated formation of few new peaks other than the starting<br>
material Santoflex® 6PPD and the product quinone-diimine (6QDI) compounds. The formation of undesired byproducts, in turn, reduced the selectivity of the formation of the desired product 6QDI.<br>
Even without the presence of triethylamine, the reaction proceeded, although at a slower rate than with triethylamine.<br>
The comparison of the following two examples further illustrates the advantages of adding pH adjusting agents, such as triethylamine, on the rate of reaction and the selectivity of desired product 6QDI. In the following examples the weight of catalyst used is wet weight, which has about 50% water. Hence the dry weight of catalyst used would be half the amount. For example, in case of catalyst weight of 1.550 g, the dry weight of catalyst would be 0.775g and so on.<br>
Example 5<br>
In accordance with procedure set forth in Example 1,   a  mixture  of  N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N' -phenyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine (Santoflex® 6PPD, 5-0 g, 0.019 moles), methanol (200 mL), triethylamine (2mL), water (2mL) and catalyst 3% Pt/C (1.550g) was charged to an autoclave. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples over a period of time and analyzing by HPLC for the<br>
product 6QDI and for the starting material Santoflex® 6PPD.  The first sample taken after 0.5 hrs was analyzed<br><br>
by HPLC area % and found to contain 99-3% 6QDI. The second sample after 1 hr reaction time when analyzed by HPLC area % was found to contain 99,4% 6QDI. This was a clear indication that the reaction was done. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst and the filtrate was concentrated to remove volatiles. The resulting dark reddish colored liquid was identified to be the corresponding N-1, 3 -dimethylbutyl -N' -phenyl -quinonediimine (6QDI) and isolated in almost quantitative yields.<br>
Example 6'<br>
In accordance with the procedure set forth in Example 1, and iinder the same conditions as in example 5 except as to the addition of triethylamine and water, this experiment was carried out.  A mixture of N-1,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl-N' -phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (Santof lex® 6PPD,   5.0 g, 0.019 moles) , methanol (200 mL) , and catalyst, 3% Pt/C (1.550g) , was charged to an autoclave. The reaction progress was monitored by taking samples over a period of time and analyzing by HPLC for the<br>
product 6QDI and for the starting material Santoflex® 6PPD. The following table 5 summarizes the results of HPLC area % analysis. These results clearly indicate that the reaction without triethylamine and water is slower than the reaction with triethylamine and water present as demonstrated in example 5 where the reaction was done in 30 minutes.<br><br><br>
An increased amount of catalyst in the process of Example 6 can be seen to produce an increased reaction rate compared to Example 4.<br>
The quinonediimines prepared by the process of the present invention exhibit multiple activities in vulcanized elastomers. These activities include long term antioxidant activity, along with antiozonant capacity. In fact, the antioxidant capacity of these antidegradants persists even after the vulcanizate has been extracted with solvents. In addition, quinonediimines provide these benefits without the negative effect on scorch generally associated with para-phenylenediamine antidegradants common to the industry. Summary of the activities of these compounds in rubber can be found in the literature, (Cain, M. E. et al., Rubber Industry/ 216-226, 1975).<br>
