				<td> <br><br>
This invention relates to a monocarboxylic acid based antifreeze composition for inhibition and prevention erosion and corrosion of aluminum and the corrosion of other metals exposed to an aqueous liquid in automotive coolant systems. The formulation further inhibits mineral scale.<br>
Traditionally antifreeze/coolant is sold at nearly one-hundred percent glycol content. This concentrated packaging allows for flexibility so that the user can dilute the antifreeze/coolant, as needed, with available water to obtain the required freeze/boil protection. However, corrosion protection is needed over the entire dilution range.<br>
In modem automotive engineering, many engine components are fabricated from aluminum. Engine coolants, primarily ethylene glycol or propylene glycol based solutions, must transfer heat from operating aluminum engines while inhibiting corrosion. Older automotive engines did not have aluminum components and thus, the<br><br>
traditional antifreeze/coolant compositions may produce corrosion in heat rejecting aluminum or aluminum alloy components. The cavitation erosion-corrosion of aluminum water pumps upon exposure to aqueous systems such as water-cooled internal combustion engine coolants is a relatively new development.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Automotive engine cooling systems consist of many metals including aluminum, steel, cast iron, brass, copper and solder. Engine coolants must not only provide freeze protection but corrosion inhibition as well. Often the components are thin walled for improved heat transfer making them more vulnerable to corrosive attack and subsequent failure. Corrosion products and deposits can interfere with heat transfer. Ultimately overheating and engine failure from thermal related stresses are possible.<br>
Traditionally engine coolants based on inorganic components like silicates, phosphates, nitrates, borates and nitrites have been used. Concerns due to inhibitor depletion, particularly silicates have lead to concerns about lifetime. Also, high solids loading from inorganic salts presents potential deposit issues. Amine and nitrite compounds, which are often employed as corrosion inhibitors in antifreeze formulations may fo3rm potentially dangerous nitroso compounds when used together. Antifreeze formulations containing phosphates are often diluted with hard<br><br>
water which results in precipitation of insoluble alkali earth phosphate salts from the aqueous antifreeze solution. The precipitation may cause depletion of the phosphate in solution and a decreaise in corrosion protection with the antifreeze solution. The precipitating solids may scale and plug passages within the engine coolant system. Moreover, several European automobile manufacturers have barrned the use of phosphate-containing antifreeze based on silicate formulations due to hard water compatibility problems.<br>
Recently the automotive industry has developed engine coolants based primarily on carboxylic acid technology. Many U.S. and foreign patent references disclose the use of various monobasic or dibasic acids or salts as corrosion inhibitors. For example, in U.S. Patent 4,647,392, Darden teaches a synergistic combination of 0.1 to 15 weight percent of C5 to C6 aliphatic monobasic acid with the same amount of C5 to C6 dicarboxylic acid and 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent of a hydrocarbonyl triazole. The triazole is typically tolytriazole or benzotriazole. The acids are present as salts in an alkaline solution. In U.S. Patent 4,946,616, Falla teaches a mixture of two aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with a hydrocarbyl triazole. In U.S. Patent 4,587,028, Darden discloses two to five weight percent of an aromatic monocarboxylic acid, benzoic acid, with 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent of a C8 to C12 aliphatic carboxylic acid and an alkali metal nitrate. British military specification TS 10177 (A139) , March of 1978, call for 4 to 4.5 weight percent of<br><br>
sebacic acid(aliphatic dicarboxylate) and 0.25 to 0,30 weight percent of benzoytriazole. In U.S. Patent 4,382,008, Boreland has combined an aromatic monocarboxylic acid with C7 to C13 dibasic organic acids and conventional inhibitors such as borate and silicate to prepare formulations. However, the use of these adcitives increase the overall cost of the formulation.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,266,651 by Maes et al. emphasizes that imidazole serves as a buffer to assist in pH control and serve as the buffer in carboxylic acid based antifreeze formulations. Imidazole is an unsubstituted triazole containing two nitrogen molecules providing a very active triazole molecule to combine with hydrogen providing a neutralizing or buffering capability.<br>
In summary, a wide number of organic acids have been successfully used in various combinations among themselves and with more common components. Typically acids are used at the several percent level if common inhibitors are not present. The presence of hydrocarbyl triazoles indicates that yellow metals such as copper and brass, and solder must be protected separately. The carboxylates are primarily inhibiting ferrous metals and aluminum in these formulations. Despite the successful lab data reported, questions remain about the ability of full acid technologies like Darden and Falla to protect solder and prevent cavitation erosion-corrosion on aluminum in engine applications. Further, the addition of large quantities of inorganic salts to correct these<br><br>
deficiencies negates the low solids benefit<br>
Finally, conventional dicarboxylic acid formulas utilize a molybdate at a 2:1 weight ratio. The ratio is significantly more costly than the typical 15:1 ratio of monobasic acid to sodium molybdate dihydrate used in Applicants composition as set forth in examples hereafter. Applicants experiments invention shows that this 2:1 ratio of acid to molybdate suggested for dicarboxylic acid based formulas is not required for obtaining an effective composition as set forth ir. the instant invention. This distinction further separates Applicants' invention from the teachings of conventional acid based antifreeze formulations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has met the above-described need by providing an antifreeze/coolant composition using a combination of a monocarboxylic acid, hydrocarbyl tolytriazole, and low levels of molybdate additives which reduce corrosion over the entire dilution range without creating precipitates. This composition is soluble in water, alcohol, and alcohol/water mixtures, is compatible with other commonly used antifreeze/coolant components, does not corrode or damage automotive cooling systems and is effective at relatively low concentrations. In addition, the present corrosion inhibition formulations are effective in reducing corrosion in the entire range of cooling system metals, including heat rejecting aluminum,<br><br><br>
aluminum alloys, copper, steel, cast iron, brass, solder and the like.<br>
The  instant antifreeze  formulation having a mixture of ethylene or propylene glycol, monobasic organic acid, azoles, and<br><br>
low levels of molybdates may also provide a synergistic protective effect against the cavitation corrosion cf aluminum in aqueous liquids reducing the corrosion rate which is effective at relatively low concentrations and varying pH ranges. The combination of monobasic organic acid, hydrocarbyl tolytriazole, and low levels of molybdaces not only significantly reduces glycol based coolant cavitation erosion-corrosion, heat rejecting aluminum corrosion, and hard water precipitates and scale, it has been discovered that the combination leads to improvement in aluminum corrosion protection and coolant life when utilized with selected amounts of the above-identified additives.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A monobasic carboxylic organic acid is used with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole in glycol mixtures to produce a well balanced antifreeze corrosion inhibiting formulation with very low solids to minimize potential deposits and surprising long life characteristics in engine testing. Moreover, the formulation according to the instant invention lead to improvement in aluminum corrosion protection and prolonged coolant life as compared to conventional silicon based coolants. In addition, the present corrosion inhibition formulations are effective in reducing corrosion in the entire range of cooling system metals, including heat rejecting aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper, steel, cast iron, brass, solder and the like. This formulation is soluble in alcohol, alcohol/water mixtures and in water alone and exhibits excellent stability characteristics.<br><br>
The most preferred antifreeze/coolant composition is an acid-based composition having a pH of about 6.0 to about 12.0 and having about 93% antifreeze grade glycols and about 4 to 7 percent corrosion inhibitors; with the balance being water.<br>
The freezing point depressant utilized in the antifreeze compositions of the invention can be any suitable water-soluble liquid alcohol used heretofore in formulating antifreeze compositions. The water-soluble alcohol contains 1 to about 4 carbon atoms and 1 to about 3 hydroxy groups. The glycols or glycol ethers which may be used as major components in the present invention include glycol monoethers such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl ethers of ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol.<br>
Ethylene glycol or propylene glycol is preferred as the freezing point depressant and especially the commercially available mixtures containing largely ethylene glycol and a small amount of diethylene glycol. The commercial mixture generally contains at least 85 to 95 percent by weight of ethylene glycol with the remainder being diethylene glycol and small amounts of substances which are incidentally present such as water. Other water-soluble liquid alcohol can be admixed with ethylene glycol but such mixtures usually are not preferred. Inexpensive commercially available water soluble alcohols can also be used such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl alcohol alone or in mixtures.<br><br>
The concentrated corrosion inhibitor formulations or tne present invention is a water-based mixture of monobasic aliphatic organic acid, azoles, particularly hydrocarbyl triazole, and low levels of molybdenum compounds. Optionally, other components including defoamers, dyes, bittering agents, biocides, and the like may be added to the present formulation. The azoles include tolytriazole, benzotriazole, rr:ercaptobenzothizole including mixtures and other substituted azoles. Suitable defoamers include PLURONIC® L-61, PATCOTE® 415 and other surfactants including silicone types. The corrosicn inhibitor formulations are compatible with other commonly used antifreeze/coolant components and are effective at relatively low concentrations.<br>
The most important preferred ingredients of the antifreeze formulation, whether mandatory or optional, are discussed below:<br>
MONOBASIC CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
The monobasic acid component of the above-identified antifreeze formulation may be any C3-C16 monobasic carboxylic acid or the alkali metal salt thereof; however, in order to maintain the desired solubility, the preferred embodiment of the instant invention utilizes an aliphatic monobasic carboxylic acid components or the alkali metal salt there of in the range of from about .C6 to about C12. Preferably, the aliphatic monobasic carboxylic acids include one or more of the following acids or<br><br>
isomers: hexanoiC; heptanoic, isoheptanoic,  octanoic, 2-ethylhexanoic; nonanoic, decanoic, undecanoic, dodecanoic, neodecanoic, and/or combinations thereof. The preferred composition uses Octanoic and 2-ethylhexanoic as the aliphacic monobasic acids. Any alkali metal hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide may be used to form the monobasic salt; however, sodium and potassium are preferred, and the potassium salt is most preferred. The monobasic acid or alkali metal salt component of the present invention is present in a concentration of from about 0 .1 to about 10.0 weight percent, more preferably from about 1.0 to about 5.0 weight percent, and most preferably from about 2.0 to' about 4.0 weight percent, based upon the total weight of the concentrate composition (the weight percent calculated based upon the free acid).<br>
A2QLE ADDITIVES<br>
Azoles are present in the formulation to inhibit corrosion of yellow metal like copper and brass. Brass thermostats and radiator caps are common as well as copper and brass radiators. The hydrocarbyl triazole of the instant invention is preferably an aromatic triazole or alkyl-substituted aromatic triazole, preferably benzotriazole or tolyltriazole. The preferred hydrocarbyl is tolyltriazole. The azole compound providing protect:ion for copper and brass from corrosion is selected from among  the  water-soluble  triazoles,  pyrazoles,  isooxazoles,<br><br>
isothiazoleS; thiazoles, thiadiazole salts, and the like. Generally, the alkali metal salts are used. Specific preferred azole compounds include 1, 2, 3-benzotriazole; 1, 2, 3 -tolyltriazole; sodium tlytriazole; and sodium 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole. Azole compounds suitable in the present invention include, salts of mercaptobenzothiazole, salts of tolytriazole, benzotric.zole, mixtures thereof and the like,-however, the preferred composition uses hydrocarbyl triazole. Typically, these azoles are used in a fifty percent solution in caustic.<br>
It is contemplated that certain azoles such as sodium 2 -mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-imidazolidinethione, 2-imidazolidinone, and imidazole define unsubstituted azoles containing two nitrogen molecules in a ring which define a very active azole molecule to combine with hydrogen providing a neutralizing or buffering capability when used with a carboxylic acid. The hydrocarbyl triazole, benzotriazole, tolytriazole, and other azole compounds utilized in Applicants' preferred embodiment contains azole compounds containing three nitrogen molecules or azoles containing more substituted and less active than the imidazole and therefor less corrosive to engine compoents and seals. Other than the imidazole, the selected less active and more stable azole compounds in the instant formulation are important as corrosion inhibitors for protecting yellow metal.<br><br>
Applicants' novel composition does not depend upon an active imidazole compound to act as a buffer. It is known in the industry that imidazole can attack seals and aggressively attacks engine components in levels as high as 2 to 4 percent or greater. Altihough borate may be added as to Applicants' formulation^ borate is a conventional buffering agent typically added to conventional silicate antifreeze formulas more so than acid based formulas.<br>
The preferred azole compounds of the present invention which comprise aromatic compouinds selected from the group of azole compounds with three nitrogen atoms in a ring such as benzotriazole and tolytriazole are present in the formulation in an amount of about 0.01 to about 5.0 percent by weight, and more preferably in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1.0 percent by weight. Generally, an azole compound, such as sodium tolytriazole 50% is used in amounts of about 0.1 parts to about 0.5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the aqueous liquid.<br>
MOLYBDATE ADDITIVES<br>
The water-soluble molybdate which is preferred for use in the aqueous systems of the present invention can be any salt of molybdic acid which is readily soluble in water. These include both alkali metal and alkaline earth metal molybdates as well as ammonium molybdate, the term "alkali molybdate" being used in a broad sense so as to include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and<br><br>
ammonium molybdates.  Examples of useful molybdates are sodium molybdate potassium molybdate,  lithium molybdate and ammonium molybdates   including   ammonium   dimolybdata   and   ammonium heptamolybdate.   Alkali molybdate compounds,  sodium molybdate, sodium    molybdate    dihydrate,    molybdenum    trioxine, heteropolymolybdates, and potassium molybdate are preferred because of their availability and compatibility with the aqueous system as well as for economic reasons.  Typically, concentrations of the molybdate ion are below about 0.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by v/eight of aqueous liquid can be employed, whereby concentrations of molybdate  ion above  this  limit  normally do  not provide significant improvements in the inhibitive characteristics or the aqueous system and are undesirable for economic reasons; however, in the instant invention it is believed that the molybdenum aids in the attachment and formation of the protective film upon the surface of the metal requiring protection.   Particularly under rapid corrosion conditions such as the cavitation erosion corrosion of aluminum.<br>
Transition metal compounds suitable for use in the present invention include, disodium salt dehydrate of molybdic acid, sodium molybdate 2H2O, molybdenum trioxide, silicoheteropolymolybdates, phosphoroheteropolymolybdates, mixtures thereof and the like. Any compatible transition metal may be used, including for example, molybdate, cobalt, cerium, mixtures thereof and the like. In addition, any acid salt may be used including sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and the<br><br>
like. The most preferred transition metal compound is the disodium salt dihydrate of molybdic acid or sodium molybdate 2H2O.<br>
Transition metal acids are used to inhibit corrosion in formulations of the present invention. The transition metal compound is preferably present in the formulation in an amount of about 0.001 to about 5.0 percent by weight, and more preferably in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1.0 percent by weight. The molybdate ion is employed in amounts so as to provide a concentration in the aqueous system of at least about 0.001 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of aqueous liquid. Preferably about 0.005 to about 0.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of molybdate based upon said aqueous liquid are employed.<br>
The addition of a selected amount of molybdate to the present composition provides a means for obtaining an acid based antifreeze coolant composition at a decreased cost as compared to other aliphatic monobasic antifreeze formulations. Moreover, acid based antifreeze compositions are very aggressive with respect to lead solder whereby a selected amount of molybdenum as exhibited by the instant invention serves to minimize if not to eliminate the deficiency of acid based composition with respect to lead solder.<br>
pH nONTROLLING COMPOUNDS<br>
The preferred embodiment of the silicate free antifreeze<br><br>
composition uses potassium hydroxide at 45 percent concentration in a range of from about .5 to 10.0 weight percent, more preferably in a range of from about 1.0 to 5.0 weight percent, and most preferably from about 2.5 to 3.0 weight percent to achieve the desired ph of about 6.0 to 12.0, and preferably from between about 8.C to about 9.0. Other pH adjusting or controlling compounds may be -added such as basic and/or acidic compounds, i.e. NaOH, KOH or NH^OH, and mineral or organic acids, i.e., HCl, H2SO4, or acetic acid, or buffering agents such as borates, to maintain the pH in the range of about 7.0 to 10.5.<br>
DEFORAMERS<br><br>
Any suitable defoamer, well known in the art, is suitable for the present formulations. Suitable defoamers include, for example, PLURONIC® L-61 non-ionic surfactant (commercially available from BASF® Corporation) or PATCOTE® 415 liquid defoamer (commercially available from Patco Specialty Chemicals Division, American Ingredients Company) . The defoamer may be present in an amount up to about 10.0 percent by weight and more preferably present in an amount of about 0.001 to about 10.0 percent by weight, and most preferably, in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.05 percent by weight.<br>
OTHER ADDITIVES<br>
Other additives such as bittering agents, dyes, tracers, or<br><br>
biocides may be added to the antifreeze/coolant solution.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION<br>
The following examples are presented to illustrate the claimed invention and are not intended to be otherwise limiting:<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
In EXAMPLE 1, Formula "A" utilizing a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole in ethylene glycol is compared to Formula "B" utilizing the same chemical constituents without the molybdate. The components can be combined in almost any order with reasonable<br><br>
mixing. Except for the molybdate; all compounds are liquids which facilitates preparation both in the laboratory and in production. These formulations were tested by the ASTM D1384 glassware test.<br>
The results are as follows:<br><br>
The negative numbers represent weight gain. In this example, the small amount of added molybdenum allows Formula A to protect high lead solder while Formula B containing the aliphatic carboxylic acid alone does not protect the high lead solder. While Formula B can be used in limited passenger car applications. Formula A has broader utility for use in automobiles as well as heavy equipment, equipment utilizing diesel engines, and industrial<br><br>
uses - Example 1 of Applicants' composition shows virtually no difference and easily passing results for a magnitude formula with molylbdate at 3.3 mg per coupon and monoacid formulation without molybdate at 3.7 mg per coupon. This result is surprising and unexpected in view of the teachings of conventional antifreeze formulas which suggest that monocarboxylic acids are unacceptable for use in antifreeze formulations in effect teaching away from Applicants novel formulation.<br><br>
In EXAMPLE 2, Formula "C" utilizes a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole; however, propylene glycol has been substituted for<br><br>
ethylene glycol.<br>
The components can be combined in almost any order with reasonable mixing.  Except for the molybdate, all compounds are<br>
liquids which facilitates preparation both in the laboratory and in production. These formulations were tested by the ASTM D13 84 glassware test.  The results are as follows:<br><br>
The negative numbers represent weight gain. These results show that Formula "C" substituting propylene glycol or the ethylene glycol of Formula "A" passes the ASTM D1384 test even on high lead solder.<br><br><br>
In EXAMPLE 3, Formula "A" utilizing a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole in ethylene glycol is compared to Formula "D" based on Darden's U.S. Patent 4,647,392 utilizing similar chemical constituents without the molybdate, but including sebacic acid.<br>
T^ese formulations were tested by the ASTM D13 84 glassware test.  The results are as follows:<br><br><br>
The negative numbers represent weight gain. In this example, the small amount of added molybdenum allows Formula A to protect high lead solder. Compared to Formula "D" based on Darden' s formulation, the present invention deletes sebacic acid, an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and adds molybdenum with better results in ASTM D 1384 corrosion tests on high lead solder. Surprisingly, the performance of the single monoacid is as good as the mono/di acid blend of Darden on aluminum in direct contrast to the<br><br>
teachings of Darden's U.S. Patent 4,647,3 92.' The results of Formula "D" based on Darden's patent is almost identical to the results obtained using Formula "B".<br>
Ey-AMPLE 4<br>
A comparison study was conducted between the instant invention for an antifreeze composition as set forth in Formula "A" comprising a monobasic aliphatic carboxylic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole, and an ethylene glycol based antifreeze coolant composition; Formula "E", containing an ethylene glycol based dicarboxylic acid composition including sebacic acid and tolytriazole.<br>
The acids were neutralized with sodium hydroxide to a pH of about 8.5. Formula "E" contained no molybdenum or inorganic additives and is similar to antifreeze composition derivatives set forth and described in British Standard TS10177 (A139) from 1978.<br>
Both the invention set forth in Formula "A" and the dicarboxylic acid Formula "E" met the requirements of ASTM D3306 and ASTM D4985 tests which encompass a battery of industry standard coolant corrosion tests, physical property tests, and performance<br>
tests.<br><br>
The Ford BL2-2 engine dynamometer test was conducted under standard conditions on each coolant. In Table 1, the instant invention comprising the Formula "A" composition was compared to the Formula "E" composition. The tests were extended to 1728 hours, the equivalent of 120,000 miles of highway driving. The test is very stressful on engine coolants, often breaking them down in a standard 672 hour test.<br>
Parameters for the test were as follows:<br>
Engine	1.9L Ford Escort<br>
Radiator	Contour/Mystique<br>
Speed	2400 RPM (revolutions per minute)<br>

The corrosion coupon bundles were changed in 9 6 hour intervals and cleaned and weighed in accordance with ASTM D13 84. Coupon averages less than 10 mg and single coupons under 3 0 mg are indicative of excellent performance. Trends in time can be significant. Outlyers can be disregarded. In each test, the engines ran properly and post test evaluation showed that the engine and cooling system components to be well protected with each<br><br>
coolant.  The weight loss results of each test in mg/coupon are reported in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Table 1 shows the data resulting from a coupon weight test using the novel antifreeze composition as set forth in Formula "A" comprising a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole under standard test conditions utilizing a Ford BL2-2 engine dynamometer test.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br>
Table 2 shows the data resulting from a Ford BL2-2 engine dynamometer test conducted under standard conditions using the ethylene glycol based antifreeze coolant composition Formula "E" utilizing an ethylene glycol based dicarboxylic acid composition including sebacic acid and tolytriazole.<br><br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<br>
As set forth in Tables 1 and 2, the data resulting from the Ford BL2-2 engine dynamometer test conducted under standard conditions, shows that Formula "A" containing the monobasic aliphatic organic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole exhibit unexpected properties and advantages not disclosed in prior art antifreeze formulations, in particular the superior long term performance on cast iron and steel as compared to Formula "E" based on the ethylene glycol based dicarboxylic acid antifreeze coolant composition of Table 2 utilizing a dicarboxylic acid composition with tolytriazole .<br>
The data from Table 1 shows that the Formula "A" composition passed the ASTM D13 84 including high lead solder. The present invention utilizing a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole in ethylene glycol gave high losses on copper, but passivated with time. This was also exhibited by the control coupon to a lesser degree and is common in this test. The corrosion coupon results of Table 1 also show tkiat the instant invention containing a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with low levels of molybdate and a hydrocarbyl<br><br>
triazole has superior long term performance on cast iron and steel than the dicarboxylic acid based coolant as seen by the results set forth in Table 2. Although the ferrous metals in the engine were well protected using both formulas, the ability to protect new metal is reduced near the end of the test for Formula "E" containing the dicarboxylic acids as set forth in Table 2. This begins at about 1384 hours with losses of 311.6 on steel and 207.5 on cast iron. This level of loss continues for the duration of the test.<br>
The test data clearly shows that the monocarboxylic acid, sodium molybdate and tolytriazole exhibits advantages over the dicarboxylic acid formula when used as an enhanced engine coolant in ethylene and propylene glycol based antifreeze for providing an extended lifetime in excess of 1728 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The antifreeze Formula "A" composition of the present invention containing the monobasic aliphatic organic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole was also compared to the ethylene glycol based antifreeze coolant composition, Formula "E", containing an ethylene glycol based dicarboxylic acid composition including sebacic acid and tolytriazole in vehicle service tests.<br>
Chrysler vans with the 5.9 liter (360 cu,in.) engines were<br><br>
tested in the Colorado rocky Mountains. The vehicles were used to transfer skiers between Denver International Airport and Vale, Colorado. the trip is 110 miles each way. The driving is mixed with highway and city inputs; however, idling in traffic is common. The vans operated eighteen (18) hours per day on and six (6) hours off, seven days a week. In three weeks, it is possible to accumulate 8,000 miles. Vans completing the test accumulated approximately 100,000 miles in roughly one year. Ten vans were operated on  each test coolant.<br>
Engines used in the test were either new or rebuilt. Cooling systems were flushed and cleaned with a chelator type cleaner prior to test fluid introduction. The copper radiators and heater cores had approximately 25,000 miles at test inception. Aluminum water pumps and timing covers were replaced. The test coolant was mixed 50% with tap water. A gallon of pre-diluted top off coolant was placed in each vehicle and care was taken to keep each vehicle properly topped off. Maintenance logs were kept for all vehicle repairs and concerns. Coolant samples of two (2) to four (4) ounces were taken at 8,000 mile intervals. Engines were removed, destructively evaluated and photographed at test end as shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
For each coolant the engines and cooling system components were vfell protected from corrosion. No vehicles had operating problems; however, distress was observed in the water pumps of the<br><br>
vehicle engines containing the dicarboxylic acid Formula "E" based coolant in all cases.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the engine water pumps and timing covers protected with the Formula "A" composition of the instant invention containing the monobasic aliphatic organic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole show the aluminum to be well protected with no pitting, blackening or corrosion being observed.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the aluminum of the engines protected with the Formula "E" dicarboxylic acid based formula was darkened with corrosion. The aluminum timing covers of the engines protected with the Formula "E" dicarboxylic acid based coolant showed similar cavitation erosion-corrosion.<br>
These tests are indicative of anticipated problems with the performance of the engines associated with the dicarboxylic acid based coolant solutions. The results are important because at a higher milage the damaged pumps can be expected to leak and fail if not replaced soon thereafter. It is also anticipated that problems associated with volumetric efficiency will be experienced possibly causing over heating of the vehicles. Thus, the experiment further demonstrates the benefit and advantages exhibited by the Formula "A" composition comprising a monobasic aliphatic organic acid with molybdate and a hydrocarbyl triazole in preventing cavitation erosion-corrosion damage.<br><br>
