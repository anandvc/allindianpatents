				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention refers to a coffee maker for brewing<br>
coffee powder contained in a cartridge, comprising a brewing cham-<br>
ber adapted to receive a coffee powder cartridge, at least one<br>
means for punching the coffee powder cartridge, and a pump for<br>
feeding hot brewing water into the brewing chamber.<br>
Coffee makers of this kind are used predominantly in homes,<br>
i.e. are designed for household use. As compared to conventional<br>
coffee makers with a grinder for grinding whole coffee beans, a<br>
fundamental advantage of the above mentioned coffee maker may be<br>
seen in the fact that a qualitatively high grade coffee beverage<br>
can be prepared by using pre-packed coffee powder cartridges, the<br>
more so as the coffee powder is optimally ground and kept in the<br>
cartridge in an airtight manner. Moreover, such coffee makers are<br>
less subject to contamination by coffee powder.<br>
For brewing the coffee powder contained in the cartridge, ei-<br>
ther manually operated or semi-automatic as well as fully auto-<br>
matic coffee makers are used. Usually, in a manually operated cof-<br>
fee maker, the cartridge is inserted into a cartridge holder that<br>
in turn is inserted into the coffee maker. In the semi-automatic<br>
coffee makers, the cartridge is inserted into a cartridge retainer<br>
or directly into the brewing chamber of the machine, whereby the<br>
brewing chamber is manually closed by means of a central lever<br>
mechanism. In a fully automatic coffee maker, however, the car-<br>
tridge is removed from a cartridge magazine and automatically in-<br>
serted into the brewing chamber; after the brewing operation, the<br>
cartridge is removed from the brewing chamber and discarded into a<br>
trash receptacle without any intervention of the operator.<br>
All these above mentioned species of coffee maker usually com-<br>
prise a hollow so-called brewing spike provided with radial outlet<br><br>
openings for injecting brewing water into the cartridge that is<br>
also adapted to punch the bottom and the cover, respectively, of<br>
the cartridge. Also known are manually operated coffee makers in<br>
which the cartridge retainer is provided with a plurality of em-<br>
bossments located on an outlet grate; these embossments break open<br>
the cover of the cartridge as soon as brewing water is injected<br>
into the cartridge from the opposite side thereof and the car-<br>
tridge is pressed against the embossments under the influence of<br>
the hydraulic overpressure created by the pressurized brewing wa-<br>
ter. During the subsequent brewing operation, the brewing water is<br>
injected into the cartridge by means of the brewing spike, with<br>
the result that is flows under pressure through the coffee powder<br>
contained in the cartridge and escapes from the cartridge through<br>
the opening created by the embossments.<br>
Independent of the fact whether it is a manually operated cof-<br>
fee maker or a semi-automatic or a fully automatic machine, the<br>
coffee maker is designed and adapted to the cartridge so as to<br>
produce a coffee beverage having froth on its surface; that froth<br>
usually is considered as a characteristic of a good coffee bever-<br>
age .<br>
Even if great efforts have been taken to ensure that the pre-<br>
pared coffee beverage has durable froth on its surface, in certain<br>
countries the desire arises to prepare also conventional coffee in<br>
the sense of a filter coffee by means of these coffee makers. In<br>
place of the expression "filter coffee", also the expression "gen-<br>
tle coffee" is used.<br>
U.S.Patent Nr. 5,325,765 discloses a beverage filter cartridge<br>
including an impermeable pierceable base having a predetermined<br>
shape and an opening at one end. A self-supporting wettable filter<br>
element is disposed in the base. It sealingly engages with the<br><br>
opening in the base and has a form different and smaller than the<br>
predetermined shape of the base so that the filter element di-<br>
verges from the base and divides the base into two sealed cham-<br>
bers, namely a first chamber for storing an extract of the bever-<br>
age to be made, and a second empty chamber for accessing the bev-<br>
erage after the beverage outflow from the filter has been made by<br>
combining a liquid with the extract. Further, it comprises an im-<br>
permeable pierceable cover sealingly engaged with the opening in<br>
the base to form an impermeable cartridge. For extracting the cof-<br>
fee powder, the cartridge is punched at both sides by means of an<br>
upper and a lower punching member. The lower punching member is<br>
eccentrically arranged such that it extends into the second cham-<br>
ber between the base and the filter element without damaging the<br>
filter element. Pressurized brewing water is fed into the car-<br>
tridge through the upper punching member. It passes through the<br>
coffee powder and the filter element and enters the second cham-<br>
ber. Therefrom, it flows through the lower punching element into a<br>
beverage container.<br>
U.S.Patent Nr. 3,537,384 discloses a steam and water preparing<br>
machine, especially for preparing coffee and tea beverages. It<br>
comprises a pump unit and a subsequent boiler. A removable filter<br>
head is provided for receiving coffee powder. The pump is designed<br>
such that it discharges a constant volume of water per revolution,<br>
independent of the inner resistance of the filter head, resulting<br>
in an exactly predetermined water amount of a predetermined tem-<br>
perature to be fed through the coffee powder contained in the fil-<br>
ter head. By varying the flow rate of the pump and/or the heat<br>
output of the boiler, the temperature of the brewing water is said<br>
to be changed such that either a conventional coffee beverage or<br>
an espresso coffee beverage can be prepared, because different<br>
flavoring agents are dissolved by different temperature levels.<br><br>
Particularly, it is noted that steam with a temperature of 110°C<br>
has to be used for preparing an espresso coffee beverage in order<br>
to dissolve particularly the bitter flavoring agents contained in<br>
the coffee powder.<br>
U.S.Patent Nr. 4,583,449 discloses a coffee percolator for se-<br>
lectively making normal coffee or espresso. It comprises a water<br>
flow path extending between a cold water supply inlet and a brew-<br>
ing unit. The flow path is divided into a first branch including a<br>
pressure pump, and a second branch including a valve adapted to<br>
close or be closed in the espresso making mode. It further com-<br>
prises control means for activating the valve(s) and/or the pump<br>
in response to the selection of the type of coffee to be made. The<br>
flow path is employed in common for the water used for making es-<br>
presso and normal coffee, and is only divided adjacent the pump<br>
into the first flow path branch including the pump and the second<br>
flow path branch forming a bypass across the pump.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a coffee<br>
maker for brewing coffee powder contained in a cartridge by means<br>
of which not only an espresso coffee beverage, but also a normal<br>
coffee beverage can be prepared, the latter one not having froth<br>
on its surface and corresponding in taste to a normal filter cof-<br>
fee .<br>
To meet this and other objects, the invention provides a cof-<br>
fee maker for brewing coffee powder contained in a cartridge, com-<br>
prising a brewing chamber adapted to receive the coffee powder<br>
cartridge, at least one means for punching the coffee powder car-<br>
tridge, and a pump for feeding hot brewing water into the brewing<br>
chamber. Further, means are provided for restricting the amount of<br>
brewing water fed into the brewing chamber per unit of time to<br>
such an extent that the brewing water flows through the powder<br><br>
coffee cartridge received in the brewing chamber essentially unpressurized.<br>
Due to the fact that means are provided for restricting the amount of brewing water fed into<br>
the brewing chamber per unit of time to such an extent that the brewing water flows through the<br>
powder coffee cartridge received in the brewing chamber essentially unpressurized, the formation of<br>
froth on the surface of the coffee beverage can be essentially avoided. Preferably, both the cover and<br>
the bottom of the cartridge are punched before the brewing operation is initiated.<br>
The invention further provides a method for the production of filter coffee comprising the<br>
steps of: inserting a filter coffee powder cartridge into a brewing chamber of a coffee maker; feeding<br>
brewing water into the brewing chamber; characterized in that a coffee maker for the production of<br>
espresso coffee is used, in that before feeding the brewing water a step of punching both the cover and<br>
the bottom of the cartridge is provided, and in that, during the feeding step, the amount of brewing<br>
water fed into the brewing chamber per unit of time is restricted, as compared to the brewing<br>
operation of the coffee maker for the production of an espresso coffee.<br>
In the following, an embodiment of the coffee maker according to the invention will be further<br>
described, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a coffee maker with its brewing chamber open; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of a coffee maker with its brewing chamber closed.<br>
Schematically shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are the essential elements of the coffee maker according<br>
to the invention, namely a fresh water tank 1, a pump 2, a boiler 3, a throttle valve 4, a brewing<br>
chamber 5, a beverage outlet 6, a control unit 7 and a selector switch 8. All these elements are<br>
mounted inside a schematically indicated housing G. Located below the beverage outlet 6, there is<br>
shown a coffee mug 17 for receiving the prepared coffee beverage. The cartridge to be put into the<br>
brewing chamber 5 and containing ground coffee is designated by reference numeral 20. In the present<br>
example, the bottom 22 of the cartridge 20 is provided with an aperture 25 which is covered by a foil<br>
26 provided at the inside of the bottom 22 of the cartridge 20. Since such a cartridge is primarily<br>
suitable for preparing filter coffee, it is designated, in the following, as a filter cartridge 20, while a<br><br>
conventional cartridge having a continuous bottom without any<br>
opening is designated as an espresso cartridge.<br>
The brewing chamber 5 comprises an upper closing plate member<br>
11 and a lower cartridge retainer 12, The inner contour of the<br>
cartridge retainer 12 essentially corresponds to the outer contour<br>
of the filter cartridge 20. In the drawings, both the closing<br>
plate member 11 and the cartridge retainer 12 are shown in a cross<br>
sectional view, The cartridge retainer 12 is movable in vertical<br>
direction, as shown by the double-arrow 18. The means for moving<br>
the cartridge retainer up and down, as well as possibly provided<br>
means for feeding and removing a cartridge, are not shown since<br>
the design thereof is well within the skill of a professional per-<br>
son.<br>
Both the lower surface of the closing plate member 11 and the<br>
bottom of the cartridge retainer 12 are provided with a punching<br>
member 13 and 15, respectively. Thereby, the upper punching member<br>
13 serves for punching the cover 21 of the cartridge 20, while the<br>
lower punching member 15 serves for punching the bottom 22 of the<br>
cartridge 20. Both punching members 13 and 15, respectively, are<br>
located centrally on the closing plate member 11 and the bottom of<br>
the cartridge retainer 12, respectively. Moreover, both punching<br>
members 13 and 15, respectively, comprise a conically shaped front<br>
portion comprising a number of slots 14 and 16, respectively,<br>
through which the brewing water can flow into the cartridge 20 and<br>
the prepared coffee beverage can flow out of the cartridge 20, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
The selector switch 8 serves for selecting the coffee beverage<br>
to be prepared. The letter "E" denotes espresso coffee, while the<br>
letter "F" denotes filter coffee. The selector switch is electri-<br>
cally connected to the control unit 7. The control unit is opera-<br>
tionally connected to the pump 2 via a conductor 9 and to a throt-<br><br>
tle valve 4 via a conductor 10. The throttle valve is inserted<br>
into a brewing water conduit 19 running from the pump 2 to the<br>
closing plate member 11. Moreover, there is provided a sensor 28,<br>
electrically connected to the control unit 7 by means of a conduc-<br>
tor 10a. The sensor 28 serves for detecting and reading a label or<br>
marking 27, provided on the cartridge 20 and containing informa-<br>
tion about the kind and/or content of the cartridge 20. Such a la-<br>
bel or marking 27 can consist, for example, of a barcode printed<br>
onto the cartridge 20; however, other kinds of markings are possi-<br>
ble, for example in electronic form. It is understood that the<br>
sensor 28 and the label or marking 27 are matched to each other to<br>
enable the sensor 28 to read the label or marking 28 and to for-<br>
ward the information contained therein to the control unit 7. In<br>
the case where exclusively cartridges 20 are used that are pro-<br>
vided with such a label or marking 28, the selector switch 8 can<br>
be omitted since the kind of cartridge 20 is automatically recog-<br>
nized by the sensor 27, and the control unit, consequently, influ-<br>
ences certain operating parameters of the coffee maker, e.g. the<br>
delivery rate of the pump 2, the adjustment of the throttle valve<br>
4 et cetera.<br>
The brewing operation using a cartridge designated for prepar-<br>
ing a froth-less coffee beverage, a so-called filter coffee, takes<br>
place as follows:<br>
The selector switch 8 is manually rotated into the position<br>
"F" and the cartridge 20 is inserted into the cartridge retainer<br>
12. Then, the retainer 12 is moved upwards towards the closing<br>
plate member 11. Upon completion of this upwards movement (see<br>
Fig. 2), both the cartridge cover 21 and the bottom 22 of the car-<br>
tridge 20, i.e. the foil 26, are punched. Once the upper end posi-<br>
tion is reached, the closing plate member 11 not only closes the<br>
brewing chamber 5, but also presses the cartridge cover 21 against<br><br>
the top end face of the cartridge retainer 12 along an annular<br>
contact area, thereby hydraulically sealing the upper portion of<br>
the cartridge 20 against the bottom 22 of the cartridge 20. As<br>
soon as the brewing chamber 5 is closed, the pump 2 is operated.<br>
The amount of brewing water fed into the brewing chamber 5 per<br>
unit of time is restricted, as compared to the brewing operation<br>
of an espresso coffee, to such an extent that the brewing water<br>
flows through the cartridge 20 essentially unpessurized. The flow<br>
restriction rate is determined either by a pre-selected, stored<br>
value or on the basis of a code contained in the label or marking<br>
27 of the cartridge 20. The flow restriction can be realized ei-<br>
ther by reducing the flow rate of the pump 2 or by adjusting the<br>
throttle valve 4. For reducing the flow rate of the pump 2, in the<br>
case of an AC operated pump, a phase controlled modulator or a<br>
wave packet controller can be used. As an alternative, the operat-<br>
ing frequency of the pump 2 can be changed. It is understood that<br>
in practice only one of the measures for reducing the flow rate of<br>
the brewing water flowing through the brewing chamber 5 per unit<br>
of time is provided, i.e. either means are provided for reducing<br>
the flow rate of the pump 2, or a throttle valve 4 is provided for<br>
reducing the effective flow cross sectional area. It is further<br>
understood that other means for reducing the flow rate of the<br>
brewing water flowing through the brewing chamber 5 per unit of<br>
time could be provided.<br>
In any case, the previously mentioned means for reducing the<br>
flow rate of the brewing water flowing through the brewing chamber<br>
5 per unit of time ensure that the flow rate, even without counter<br>
pressure, is reduced to not more than 12 liters per hour, prefer-<br>
able to 8 liters per hour.<br>
Further important is that both the cover 21 of the cartridge<br>
20 and the bottom 22 of the cartridge 20 are punched, i.e. pro-<br><br>
vided with an aperture, before the brewing operation is initiated<br>
in order to ensure that no hydraulic pressure build-up can take<br>
place, which would lead to the formation of froth in the beverage.<br>
As can be further seen in the drawings, the filter cartridge<br>
20 is provided with an upper filter element 23 and a lower filter<br>
element 24. Such filter elements 23, 24 favor a consistent flow of<br>
the brewing water through the filter cartridge 20 and prevent the<br>
coffee powder contained in the cartridge 20 from escaping through<br>
the punched out apertures. The filter elements 23, 24 are provided<br>
each with a recess directed towards the interior of the cartridge<br>
20 and located in the area where the cover 21 and the bottom 22,<br>
respectively, of the cartridge 20 are punched and into which the<br>
punching members 13, 15 extend once the cartridge cover 21 and<br>
bottom 22 are punched. In order to ensure that the bottom 22 of<br>
the cartridge 20 is reliably punched upon closing the brewing<br>
chamber 5, a foil 26 is provided which has a low ductility and a<br>
low tensile strength as compared to the material of the cartridge<br>
itself, such that it easily tears apart under the influence of the<br>
lower punching memberl5 located at the bottom of the cartridge re-<br>
tainer 12.<br>
For preparing a conventional espresso coffee, the selector<br>
switch 8 is manually rotated into the position marked "E". In this<br>
mode of operation, the brewing water flows through a conventional<br>
espresso cartridge under high pressure. In the present case, the<br>
expression "espresso coffee" shall mean a coffee beverage that is<br>
provided with a froth layer at its top, independent of the amount<br>
of brewing water used for preparing the coffee beverage. Prefera-<br>
bly, for preparing a filter coffee, different cartridges are used<br>
than for preparing espresso coffee. Besides the different design<br>
of the bottom of the cartridge, also the coffee powder blend, the<br>
amount of coffee powder and/or the degree of grinding can be dif-<br><br>
ferent. Moreover, in the case of a filter coffee cartridge, the<br>
apertures in the filter elements 23, 24 are larger and/or their<br>
number is increased, such that these filter elements 23, 24 do not<br>
constitute a hydraulic resistance to the brewing water flowing<br>
there trough.<br>
As an alternative to the embodiment discussed herein before,<br>
the coffee maker can incorporate more extensive features: For ex-<br>
ample, means can be provided to punch the bottom of the cartridge<br>
later than the cover of the cartridge, depending on the kind of<br>
coffee beverage to be prepared. In case an espresso coffee is to<br>
be prepared, the bottom of the espresso cartridge is punched only<br>
after a certain hydraulic pressure has been built up in the inte-<br>
rior of the cartridge, because this measure favors the formation<br>
of froth, as is well known.<br>
Alternatively, in the case of an espresso cartridge, its bot-<br>
tom can be punched by the lower punching member in a first phase<br>
only partially, i.e. to such an extent that the tip of the punch-<br>
ing member just penetrates the bottom of the cartridge, but only<br>
so far that the slots 16 of the punching member 15 do not communi-<br>
cate with the interior of the espresso cartridge. In this way, a<br>
hydraulic overpressure can be built up in the interior of the es-<br>
presso cartridge during a first phase of the brewing operation.<br>
On the other hand, in brewing a coffee beverage with the help<br>
of a filter cartridge, both the cover and the bottom of the latter<br>
one are punched before the real brewing operation starts in order<br>
to avoid a hydraulic overpressure in the interior of the filter<br>
cartridge which would favor the formation of froth.<br>
The coffee maker according to the invention is known under the<br>
designation "espresso machine"; it is suitable both for preparing<br>
a filter coffee beverage and particularly an espresso coffee bev-<br>
erage. The coffee maker can be designed as a manually operated ma-<br><br>
chine, with a cartridge holder to be manually inserted into the<br>
machine, or as a semi- or fully-automatic coffee maker.<br>
For realizing the afore mentioned measures, for example the<br>
lower punching member 15 located at the bottom of the cartridge<br>
retainer 12 can be vertically adjustable. The height position ad-<br>
justment thereof can be performed by means of an electric motor or<br>
an electro magnet, under the control of the common control unit 7.<br><br>
