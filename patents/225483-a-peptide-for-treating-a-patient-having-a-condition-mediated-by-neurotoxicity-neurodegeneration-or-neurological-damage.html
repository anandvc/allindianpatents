CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/207654, filed May 26, 2000.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to methods of treating diseases and conditions<br>
involving the nervous system by administration of compositions having the therapeutic<br>
activity of human erythropoietin. These compositions include therapeutic agents such as<br>
peptides, peptide dimers, polypeptides, and proteins that have the full range of biological<br>
activity of human erythropoietin or only certain biological activities of erythropoietin. The<br>
present invention also provides improved therapeutic regimens wherein the therapeutic agent<br>
is administered at concentrations below those required to stimulate hematopoiesis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the kidney in response<br>
to tissue hypoxia that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. The gene for<br>
erythropoietin has been cloned and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as<br>
described in United States Patent No. 4,703,008. Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-<br>
HuEPO or Epoetin alfa) has an amino acid sequence identical to that of human urinary<br>
erythropoietin, and the two are indistinguishable in chemical, physical and immunological<br>
tests. Recombinant human erythropoietin acts by increasing the number of cells capable of<br>
differentiating into mature erythrocytes, triggering their differentiation and augmenting<br>
hemoglobin synthesis in developing erythroblasts (Krantz SB. Blood (1991) 77: 419-434,<br>
Beckman BS, Mason-Garcia M. The Faseb Journal (1991) 5: 2958-2964).<br>
Epoetin alfa has been well tolerated in studies conducted to date. Hypertensive<br>
encephalopathy and seizures have occasionally been described in dialysis patients treated with<br>
Epoetin alfa, particularly during the early phase of therapy when hematocrit is rising. (Eschbach<br>
JW, Egrie JC, Downing MR, Browne JK, Adamson JW. New Engl J Med (1987) 316: 73-78,<br>
Winearls CG, Oliver DO, Pippard MJ, et al. Lancet (1986) 2 (8517): 1175-1177). Such reports<br>
became more rare as experience of use of the compound developed. Occasionally, cancer<br>
patients treated with Epoetin alfa have experienced an increase in blood pressure associated with<br>
a significant increase in hematocrit. The risk, however, appears substantially lower than in<br>
chronic renal failure patients.<br>
No antibody titers against Epoetin alfa could be demonstrated and confirmed in subjects<br>
treated with Epoetin alfa for up to 2 years, indicating the absence of immunological sensitivity to<br>
Epoetin alfa. Skin rashes and urticaria have been observed rarely and when reported have been<br>
mild and transient in nature, but these events suggest allergic hypersensitivity to some<br>
components of the Epoetin alfa formulation.<br>
Epoetin alfa is approved for sale in many countries for the treatment of anemia in chronic<br>
renal failure (dialysis and predialysis), anemia in zidovudine treated HIV positive patients (US),<br>
anemia in cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, as a facilitator of<br>
autologous blood pre-donation, and as a peri-surgical adjuvant to reduce the likelihood of<br>
requiring allogeneic blood transfusions in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.<br>
EPO influences neuronal stem cells, likely during embryonic development, and<br>
possibly during in vitro experiments of differentiation. (Juul et al Pediatr Dev Pathol (1999)<br>
2(2) 148 - 158. Juul et al Pediatr Res (1998) 43(1) 40 - 49.) Further, neonates and infants<br>
that suffer CNS injury via hypoxia, meningitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage, show an<br>
EPO induced neuroprotective effect (Juul et al Ped Res (1999) 46(5) 543 - 547.)<br>
EPO helps prevent apoptosis of neural tissue in cases of injury that create hypoxia.<br>
This may be the result of EPO produced locally by astrocytes (Morishita et al Neuroscience<br>
(1996) 76(1) 105 - 116). Neuroprotection has been demonstrated in gerbil hippocampal and<br>
rat cerebrocortical tissue (Sakanaka et al PNAS (1998) 95(8) 4635 - 4640. Sadamoto et al<br>
Biochem Biophys Res Commun (1998) 253(1) 26 - 32).<br>
EPO induces biological effects of PC12 cells, including changes in Ca2+, changes in<br>
membrane potential, and promotion of neuronal survival. This has been interpreted that EPO<br>
can stimulate neural function and viability (Koshimura et al J. Neurochem (1999) 72(6)<br>
2565-2572. Tabria et al Int J Dev Neurosci (1995) 13(3/4) 241 - 252.).<br>
O'Brien et al propose that a 17 amino acid peptide sequence of EPO can act through<br>
the EPO -R (Erythropoietin receptor) to induce biological activity in NS20Y, SK-N-MC, and<br>
PC 12 cells, which includes sprouting, differentiation and neuroprotection. Curiously this<br>
peptide does not promote proliferation of hematologic cells, thus it appears inactive in cell<br>
lines well understood for their sensitivity to EPO activity. (Campana et al Int J Mol Med<br>
(1998) 1(1) 235 - 241 and United States Patent No.'s 5,700,909, issued on 12/23/1999,<br>
5,571,787, issued on 11/5/1996, 5,714,459, issued on 2/3/1998, and 5,696,080, issued on<br>
12/9/1997, all to O'Brien et al.)<br>
EPO may influence neuronal stem cell commitment to drive differentiation of neurons<br>
as opposed to astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. This is compared to a similar activity of EPO,<br>
where it functions to drive commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to produce red blood<br>
cells (RBCs). There is an apparent relationship between CNS hypoxic injury, resulting in the<br>
production of EPO from astrocytes that commits neuronal stem cells to differentiate into<br>
neurons, while simultaneously acting as a neuroprotective function for existing neurons.<br>
(WIPO publication number WO99/21966, published on 5/6/1999, Weiss et al.)<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 Panel A and Panel B show that EPO receptor is expressed in rat hippocampal<br>
and cortical cultures.<br>
Figure 2 shows that EPO receptor is expressed in neuronal cell lines: PC 12 and SK-<br>
N-MC cells.<br>
Figure 3 shows EPO induced gene expression in PC 12 cells. (Top) Total RNA<br>
isolated from PC-12 cells treated with 1 nm EPO for 24 hr was subject to RT-PCR to<br>
quantify the changes in gene expression of specific BCL family members. Pre-treatment with<br>
EPO resulted in a 6 fold increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCLXL and a<br>
greater than 5 fold decrease in the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bak. These results are<br>
consistent with the gene chip results suggesting a possible mechanism for EPO's protective<br>
effects. (Bottom) Agarose gels showing RT-PCR products representing the regulation of<br>

Figure 4 shows that rhEPO protects rat cerebral cortical neurons against glutamate<br>
toxicity.<br>
Figure 5 shows that rhEPO protects rat PC12 cells against glutamate-induced cell<br>
death. 7 day cultures of PC-12 cells were treated with erythropoietin for 24 hours before<br>
being exposed to a toxic concentration of glutamate (200 urn). Cultures were allowed to<br>
recover for 24 hours and cell survival was determined using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay. 1<br>
to 10 pm Erythropoietin given 24 hours prior to a 15 minute exposure to glutamate<br>
significantly increased cell survival (p<.001 student t-test. the protective activity of epo></.001>
decreased at higher doses.<br>
Figure 6 shows that rhEPO protects rat PC 12 cells against NGF withdrawal-induced<br>
cell death. Cultures of PC-12 cells were grown in the presence of NGF for 7 days and then<br>
treated with EPO for 24 hours before they were switched to media without NGF. Cell<br>
survival was determined by counting the number of viable cells immediately following the<br>
removal of NGF and comparing it to the number of viable cells at 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr and 72<br>
hr following growth factor withdrawal. Cell viability was determined based on morphological<br>
characteristics including phase brightness, presence of axons and absence of membrane<br>
Webbing. Treatment with EPO increased the number of viable cells at each time point<br>
following growth factor withdrawal with an optimum concentration of 10 pm.<br>

EPO is administered by any suitable means as appropriate for the particular patient being<br>
treated, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art. The phrase "therapeutically effective" as<br>
used herein will vary from patient-to-patient, and depending on the particular range of<br>
biological activities possessed by the EPO molecule being administered. Typically, for EPO<br>
having hematopoietic activity, a therapeutically effective amount will be from about 1 to 500<br>
I.UAg body weight and more preferably from 50 to 300 I.UAg body weight especially<br>
when erythropoietin is administered via subcutaneously. For EPO molecules not possessing<br>
hematopoietic activity the therapeutically effective dose may be more or less that an EPO<br>
molecule having hematopoietic activity. The preferred methods of administration are<br>
intravenous (iv) and subcutaneous (sc), with subcutaneous being generally preferred.<br>
Hematopoieucally active EPO is administered within the range of about 50 - 1000 U/kg per<br>
dose, one to five times per week. In another embodiment, the EPO composition is administrated<br>
directly to the nervous system. This administration route includes, but is not limited to, the<br>
intracerebral, intraventricular, intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, intracisternal, intraspinal<br>
and/or peri-spinal routes of administration, which can employ intracranial and intravertebral<br>
needles, and catheters with or without pump devices. Infusion doses can range, for example,<br>
from about 1.0 to 50,000 U/kg/min of EPO composition over a period ranging from several<br>
minutes to several days. Hematopoietically active EPO administration is delayed or withheld if<br>
the patient, male or female, exhibits a hemoglobin level in excess of about 15 g/dL.<br>
The present invention provides in one embodiment a method to treat acute and<br>
chronic neurodegenerative disorders comprising administration of EPO or analogs thereof.<br>
Acute neurodegenerative disorders include, but are not limited to, various types of acute<br>
neurodegenerative disorders associated with neuronal cell death or compromise including<br>
cerebrovascular insufficiency, focal or diffuse brain trauma, diffuse brain damage, and spinal<br>
cord injury. Examples of acute neurodegenerative disorders are: cerebral ischemia or<br>
infarction including embolic occlusion and thrombotic occlusion, reperfusion following acute<br>
ischemia, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, cardiac arrest, as well as intracranial<br>
hemorrhage of any type (such as epidural, subdural, subarachnoid and intracerebral), and<br>
intracranial and intravertebral lesions (such as contusion, penetration, shear, compression and<br>
laceration), and whiplash shaken infant syndrome. Chronic neurodegenerative disorders that<br>
can be treated with one or more methods of the present invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy (Steel-Richardson syndrome), multisystem degeneration (Shy-Drager syndrome),<br>
chronic epileptic conditions associated with neurodegeneration, motor neuron diseases<br>
including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, degenerative ataxias, cortical basal degeneration,<br>
ALS-Parkinson's-Dementia complex of Guam, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,<br>
Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, synucleinopathies (including multiple system<br>
atrophy), primary progressive aphasia, striatonigral degeneration, Machado-Joseph disease /<br>
spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and olivopontocerebellar degenerations, Grilles De La Tourette's<br>
disease, bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy, spinal and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's<br>
disease), primary lateral sclerosis, familial spastic paraplegia, Werdnig-Hoffmann disease,<br>
Kugelberg-Welander disease, Tay-Sach's disease, Sandhoff disease, familial spastic disease,<br>
Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease, spastic paraparesis, progressive multifocal<br>
leukoencephalopathy, familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), and prion diseases<br>
(including, but not limited to Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease,<br>
Kuru and fatal familial insomnia).<br>
Because of the combination of neuroprotection and neurite outgrowth induced by<br>
rhEPO, other clinical conditions can be treated with one or more methods of the present<br>
invention include treating and / or preventing the neurological (including, but not limited to,<br>
cognitive) and psychiatric (including, but not limited to, psychopathology, depression, or<br>
anxiety), manifestations associated with peripheral diseases including, but not limited to,<br>
EPO deficiency (e.g., renal disease), blood loss of any kind (including, but not limited to,<br>
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, diagnostic sampling, occult gastrointestinal bleeding), renal<br>
failure and end-stage renal disease, renal transplantation, and other conditions associated with<br>
anemia and neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations, including, but not limited to,<br>
hematological and non-hematological malignancies / cancer, symptoms or complications in<br>
patients receiving chemotherapy (including, but not limited to, cisplatin) and other drugs<br>
(including, but not limited to, zidovudine), other hematological disorders (including, but not<br>
limited to, sickle cell anemia and thalassemia), inflammatory and infectious disorders<br>
(including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency viral infections), chronic systemic<br>
autoimmune diseases (including, but not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus), Henoch<br>
Schonlein Purpura, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Also included in the present invention<br>
are the treatment and / or prevention of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations<br>
resulting from chemical, toxic, infectious and radiation injury of the nervous system and as a<br>
result of prematurity, as well as the treatment and / or prevention of neurological and<br>
neuropsychiatric consequences of encephalopathies including, but not limited to, those of<br>
anoxic-ischemia, hepatic, glycemic, uremic, electrolyte and endocrine origin.<br>
Also, because of the combination of neuroprotection and neurite outgrowth induced<br>
by rhEPO, this molecule can also be applicable for the treatment and / or prevention of<br>
plexopathies (including plexus palsies), multifocal neuropathies, sensory neuropathies, motor<br>
neuropathies, sensory-motor neuropathies, infections neuropathies, autonomic neuropathies,<br>
sensory-autonomic neuropathies, demyelinating neuropathies (including, but not limited to,<br>
Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy),<br>
other inflammatory and immune neuropathies, neuropathies induced by drugs, neuropathies<br>
induced by pharmacological treatments, neuropathies induced by toxins, traumatic<br>
neuropathies (including, but not limited to, compression, crush, laceration and segmentation<br>
neuropathies), metabolic neuropathies, endocrine and paraneoplastic neuropathies, and other<br>
neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 1a, 1b, 2, 4a, 1-X linked),<br>
Friedreich's ataxia, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Refsum's disease,<br>
adrenomyeloneuropathy, Ataxia-telangiectasia, Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (types A and B),<br>
Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and disorders of the cranial nerves.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting<br>
the same thereto.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
rhEPO is expressed in primary rat neuronal cultures and in neuronal cell lines<br>
Primary Neuronal Cell Culture<br>
Dissociated hippocampal and cortical cell cultures were established from embryonic<br>
day 18 rat fetuses as previously described (Mattson et al., 1994). Briefly, fetuses were<br>
removed via cesarean section from pregnant moms (Sprague-Dawley) anesthetized with<br>
halothane according to the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia. Pups were decapitated and the<br>
brains were removed and placed in HEPES-buffered Hank's Balanced Salt solution (HBSS;<br>
Gibco). The hippocampi and cortices were dissected out and pooled according to tissue-type.<br>
Tissue was trypsinized for 15 min (1mg/ml trypsin-HBSS; Worthington), rinsed with fresh<br>
HBSS, incubated in trypsin inhibitor (1mg/ml; Sigma) for 5 min, rinsed again with fresh<br>
HBSS and then triturated in 1ml fresh HBSS with a fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociated<br>
cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well onto poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates<br>
(Collaborative BioScience). Each well contained 100µl of Eagle's Minimal Essential Media<br>
(MEM; Gibco) supplemented with 26mM NaHCO3 (Sigma), 56mM glucose (Sigma), 15mM<br>
KCl (Sigma), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 1.1mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 10% (v/v) heat-<br>
inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 0.001% gentamicin sulfate (Sigma) (pH 7.4).<br>
Cells were allowed to attach for 24h in a humidified 37°C 5% CO2 incubator before<br>
experimental treatment. The culture media was aspirated and exchanged with fresh media<br>
every three days.<br>
Immunocytochemistry<br>
Parallel hippocampal and cortical cultures were treated as described above and<br>
were processed for immunocytochemistry (ICC) as described previously (Smith-<br>
Swintosky et al., 1997). Briefly, cells were plated onto four-chamber poly-D-lysine<br>
coated glass slides (LabTek, Napersville, EL). On the seventh day in culture, the culture<br>
media was removed and the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered<br>
saline (DPBS; Sigma) and then fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 15min at<br>
room temperature. After fixation, the cultures were rinsed with DPBS and placed in<br>
blocking serum for 10min (normal horse serum; 1:50 dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs,<br>
Burlingame, CA). Cultures were rinsed again and then incubated for 30min in an anti-<br>
mouse monoclonal antibody specific to the EPO receptor (EBP-7); 1:75 dilution in<br>
antibody diluent (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). Cultures were rinsed several times<br>
with DPBS, then exposed to biotinylated secondary antibody for 30min (Vector Labs).<br>
Cultures were rinsed a final time and then incubated for 30min in avidin-biotinylated<br>
horseradish peroxidase complex (mouse IgG ABC kit, Vector Labs). The presence of the<br>
primary antibody was detected using 3'3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB,<br>
Biomeda, Foster City, CA) - two exposures for 5min each. Cells were then<br>
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, coverslipped and photographed<br>
under an Olympus BX-2 light microscope.<br>
Results<br>
Robust staining for EPO receptor was observed in both neurons and glia within<br>
hippocampal and cortical cultures (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). EPO receptor expression levels<br>
appear to increase with time in culture.<br>
Discussion<br>
These results show that EPO plays a role in early development of the nervous system,<br>
particularly the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.<br>
Immunohistochemistry of neuronal cell lines<br>
The neuronal cell lines PC-12, derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal<br>
gland (Greene and Tischler, 1976), and SK-N-MC, obtained from a neuroepithelioma of a<br>
brain of human origin (Spengler et al., 1973), were used. PC-12 cells can be reversibly<br>
induced to the neuronal phenotype in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). PC-12 cells<br>
were grown on poly-D-Lysine coated tissue culture dishes in DMEM containing 10% horse<br>
serum and 5% FBS and in the presence of 0.1 µg/ml NGF for 7 days to induce the neuronal<br>
phenotype. SK-N-MC cells were cultured in minimal essential media supplemented with 1.0<br>
mM Sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2mM glutamine and 10% FBS for 4 days.<br>
PC-12 and SK-N-MC cells were cultured in a 96 well plate from Greiner, conducive for<br>
microscopy. On the day of the experiment cells were fixed in 10% Formalin containing 10%<br>
sucrose and incubated in blocking buffer (40 mM Tris HCL, Ph 8.0, 27mM NaCl, and<br>
0.2%Tween 20). Receptors for erythropoietin were detected by incubating the cells with a<br>
rabbit polyclonal, anti-erythropoietin receptor antibody (C-20 from Santa Cruz) and a FITC<br>
conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled cells were visualized using a fluorescent microscope<br>
(ATTO).<br>
Results<br>
A polyclonal antibody against the erythropoietin receptor labeled both SK-N-MC and<br>
PC-12 cells as seen in Figure 2 (right panels). All SK-N-MC cells visible at low<br>
magnification appeared to be labeled with the antibody. The majority of PC-12 cells that<br>
were detectable were labeled with the anti-erythropoietin receptor antibody. A few intact PC-<br>
12 cells that retained a characteristic neuronal phenotype in this preparation showed staining<br>
throughout the axonal process as well as in the cell body. Secondary antibody alone did not<br>
label either cell type (Figure 2, left panels).<br>
Therefore, these results demonstrate that these cell lines, SK-N-MC cells from a<br>
human neuroepithelioma and PC-12 cells from a rat pheochromocytoma, express the<br>
erythropoietin receptor. These cell lines are therefore responsive to erythropoietin and can<br>
provide a good system to study the effects of erythropoietin on neurons.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
EPO induced gene expression in PC 12 cells<br>
Cell Culture<br>
PC-12 cells (from a rat Pheochromocytoma) were cultured on poly-D-Lysine coated<br>
tissue culture plastic in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 5% Horse serum. To induce the<br>
neuronal phenotype in PC-12 cells, serum was removed and the cells were treated with NGF<br>
(50 ng/ml). Cells were grown for 7 days in the presence of the NGF then used for<br>
experiments.<br>
EPO Treatment and RNA isolation<br>
PC-12 cells were cultured as described in Example 1 in a 10 cm poly-D-lysine coated<br>
tissue culture dish. Cells were incubated in the presence of lU/ml of EPO for 24 hr. Total<br>
RNA was then isolated using a Qiagen RNAeasy mini prep kit and used for RT-PCR.<br>
Quantitative RT-PCR<br>
Real time reverse transcription and PCR were performed in a single reaction using a<br>
light cycler and an RNA amplification kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNA was<br>
quantitated and added in equal amounts to reaction mix that includes the dsDNA specific dye<br>
SYBR green I. Specific PCR reaction products are quantitated by detecting the amount of<br>
fluorescence in the reaction at each PCR cycle. Final analysis was performed using the data<br>
analysis software included with the light cycler instrument.<br>
Summary<br>
Pre-treatment of PC-12 cells with EPO (lU/ml) for 24 hr resulted in significant<br>
changes in the gene expression of the bcl-2 family members bclXL and bak as seen in Figure<br>
3. Cells treated with EPO showed a 6-fold increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic<br>
gene, bclXL, and a 5-fold decrease in the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene, bak. EPO has<br>
been shown previously to increase the survival of red blood cell progenitor cells by<br>
increasing bclXL expression (Silva et al., 1996). These results show that EPO uses a similar<br>
mechanism to protect neurons from undergoing apoptosis in response to injury. The<br>
regulation of bak shows that EPO can effect the expression of additional genes to elicit this<br>
effect.<br>

Cells were allowed to attach for 24h in a humidified 37°C 5% CO2 incubator before<br>
experimental treatment. The culture media was aspirated and exchanged with fresh media<br>
every three days.<br>
Glutamate Toxicity Assay<br>
Cortical cells were seeded at 200,000 cells/dish onto polyethylenimine-coated 35mm<br>
culture dishes. Each dish contained 1.5ml MEM supplemented as described above. On the<br>
seventh day in culture, four fields per pre-marked dish were visualized with a Nikon Diaphot<br>
inverted microscope (10x magnification) and photographed prior to experimental treatment.<br>
Immediately following, the cultures were treated with vehicle or recombinant human<br>
erythropoietin (rhEPO; lot #41C514; 50µM stock in 0.2M citrate, 0.585g.L NaCl diluted to<br>
appropriate concentrations in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Sigma) + 0.1%<br>
bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma)). Twenty-four hours later the cultures were treated<br>
with 100µM glutamate (Sigma). Twenty-four hours post-glutamate, the four fields from each<br>
dish were photographed again. Cell survival was measured by counting viable cells in each<br>
field pre- and post-experimental treatment. Neurons were considered viable if they had<br>
neurites that were uniform in diameter and smooth in appearance, and somata that were<br>
smooth and round to oval in shape. Data were expressed as percent of control (vehicle;<br>
mean ± SD).<br>
PC12 Cell Culture<br>
PC-12 cells (from a rat Pheochromocytoma) were cultured on poly-D-Lysine coated<br>
tissue culture plastic in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 5% Horse serum. To induce the<br>
neuronal phenotype in PC-12 cells, serum was removed and the cells were treated with NGF<br>
(50 ng/ml). Cells were grown for 7 days in the presence of the NGF then used for<br>
experiments.<br>
Glutamate Toxicity<br>
PC-12 cells were cultured as described above. 24 hr prior to insult, cells were treated<br>
with rhEPO at concentrations ranging from 1 pm to 1 nm. On the day of the experiment, cells<br>
were exposed to 200 uM glutamate for 30 min. Cells were then washed 2 times with fresh<br>
media to remove the glutamate and cultured in fresh media containing NGF but no EPO.<br>
After 24 hr cells were assayed for viability using a trypan blue exclusion assay. Briefly,<br>
media was removed and the cells were incubated in 0.4% Trypan Blue for 5 min. Cells were<br>
then washed gently with PBS, then fixed with 10% formalin. Cell viability was determined<br>
by counting the total number of cells vs. the number of trypan blue positive (dead) cells.<br>
NGF withdrawal<br>
PC-12 cells were cultured as described above in a 96 well poly-d-lysine coated<br>
multi-well plate and treated with rhEPO (1 pm to 10 nm) for 24 hr prior to NGF<br>
withdrawal. On the day of the experiment the cells were washed with buffer 3 times to<br>
remove NGF and then cultured in fresh media without NGF. Immediately following<br>
NGF washout cells were counted (t=0) to determine the number of living cells. Cell<br>
viability was based on morphological characteristics including phase brightness, presence<br>
of axons, and absence of blebbing. Cell counts were performed at 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr and<br>
72 hr and the number of viable cells were scored.<br>
Neurite Outgrowth Assay<br>
Twenty-four hours after plating, cultures were treated with vehicle (PBS+0.1% BSA),<br>
100ng of various growth factors (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Promega), glial-<br>
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Promega), nerve growth factor (NGF; Boehringer<br>
Mannheim), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Boehringer Mannheim), insulin-like<br>
growth factor -1 (IGF-1; Boehringer Mannheim), neurotrophin-3 (NT3; Calbiochem),<br>
neurotrophin-4 (NT4; Calbiochem), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; Calbiochem),<br>
epidermal growth factor (EGF; Calbiochem), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;<br>
Calbiochem)), or rhEPO (prepared same as above; 10fM - 10nM)). Each treatment condition<br>
was run in quadruplicate or octuplicate. On the third day in culture, the media was aspirated<br>
off and replaced with fresh media and test compound. At one week in culture, the cells were<br>
fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 15min, then rinsed with DPBS (Sigma) and<br>
placed in blocking serum for 30 min (horse serum; 1:50 dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs).<br>
Cultures were rinsed again with DPBS and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 hr<br>
(microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) is a selective marker for dendritic processes;<br>
anti-mouse monoclonal (Chemicon); 1:1000 dilution of MAP-2 in antibody diluent<br>
(Zymed)). Negative control wells were incubated in antibody diluent alone. Background<br>
signal was determined by blank wells (cell-free) incubated with or without antibody.<br>
Cultures were rinsed again with DPBS and then placed in fluorescein for 1 hr (FITC; anti-<br>
mouse IgG; rat adsorbed; 1:50 dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs). Cultures were rinsed a final<br>
time with DPBS and then the plates were read on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader.<br>
Neurite outgrowth was expressed as percent change from control (vehicle; mean fluorescence<br>
± SD).<br>
Results<br>
Neuroprotection study with primary neuronal cultures: Pretreatment of cultures with<br>
rhEPO for 24h prior to glutamate administration resulted in a significant increase in neuronal<br>
survival (Figure 4). Cell survival was maximally increased approximately 200% over<br>
parallel cultures treated with glutamate alone. The neuroprotective effect of rhEPO was<br>
concentration-dependent, with the greatest effects observed at pM concentrations in which<br>
cell survival was greater than or equal to vehicle (no glutamate) treated cultures.<br>
Neuroprotection study with PC 12 cells: Pre-treatment with EPO resulted in a<br>
significant decrease in cell death induced by both glutamate toxicity and growth factor<br>
withdrawal in PC-12 cells (Figures 5 and 6). The peak concentration for the neuroprotective<br>
effect in both experiments was 10 pm. The dose response curve for the neuroprotective effect<br>
of EPO was bi-phasic with the ability of EPO to protect cells against cytotoxicity decreasing<br>
at concentrations above 10 pm, with no significant effect at 1 ran. These results suggest that<br>
EPO is able to prevent an apoptotic response in neurons exposed to a variety of cytotoxic<br>
insults<br>
Neurite outgrowth study with primary neuronal cultures: Cultures treated with rhEPO<br>
resulted in a significant increase in neurite outgrowth as measured by MAP2-FITC<br>
immunofluorescence. The neurite outgrowth promoting effect was concentration dependent<br>
with maximal activity observed at pM levels (Figures 7 and 8). The results indicate that<br>
rhEPO treatment induced a larger outgrowth response in the hippocampal cultures (12-44%<br>
over control) than in the cortical cultures (15-29% over control). A comparison between<br>
rhEPO and known growth factors indicates that they exhibit regional differences in their<br>
neurite outgrowth promoting abilities. rhEPO's ability to increase neurite outgrowth in<br>
cortical cultures is greater than or equal to that of known growth factors. This observation is<br>
compelling and important since few factors have such effects on cortical cells. On the other<br>
hand, many growth factors exert strong outgrowth responses in the hippocampus (38-86%<br>
over control). Compared to such growth factors, rhEPO showed moderate yet robust<br>
outgrowth promoting activity; however, its activity was superior to several growth factors<br>
including BDNF, NGF and VEGF.<br>
Discussion<br>
The neuroprotection studies confirmed previous evidence that rhEPO is protective at<br>
pM concentrations against glutamate toxicity and serum withdrawal in vitro.<br>
Surprisingly we discovered that rhEPO promotes neurite outgrowth in primary<br>
mammalian neural cells. The effect was robust for hippocampal and cortical cells. The<br>
effect was potent with efficacy observed at sub-picomolar concentrations, far more potent<br>
than any previous EPO related observation. Moreover, in cerebral cortical neurons, which<br>
respond to few growth factors, rhEPO was superior in inducing neurite outgrowth relative to<br>
the majority of known growth factors.<br>
From a therapeutic perspective, the observation that rhEPO promotes neuroprotection<br>
and neurite outgrowth in cerebral cortical neurons is very important. During<br>
neurodegeneration, neural cells can be in different stages of the process. Some may be<br>
stressed, others experience significant neurite retraction and loss of synaptic input, and<br>
eventually all affected cells will succumb to death. A therapeutic agent that can intervene in<br>
this process at multiple levels can be of great benefit to the recovery of the neural cells and<br>
eventually neural function. The present data support that rhEPO accomplishes this task by<br>
protecting the cells, by enhancing their survival, by promoting re-establishment of synaptic<br>
contacts and connections, and by stabilizing the neuronal and neural circuitry.<br>
It should also be specified that the data are particularly important, considering that<br>
very few growth factors are effective in cerebral cortical neurons, and also that very few<br>
growth factors display the dual activity as neuroprotectants and promoters of neurite<br>
outgrowth in cortical neurons. It is particularly relevant that this dual activity of rhEPO was<br>
observed at sub-picomolar / picomolar concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
EPO MIMETIC PEPTIDES STIMULATE NEURITE OUTGROWTH<br>
Cell Culture<br>
Dissociated hippocampal and cortical cell cultures were established from embryonic<br>
day 18 rat fetuses as previously described (Mattson et al., 1994). Briefly, fetuses were<br>
removed via cesarean section from pregnant moms (Sprague-Dawley) anesthetized with<br>
halothane according to the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia. Pups were decapitated and the<br>
brains were removed and placed in HEPES-buffered Hank's Balanced Salt solution (HBSS;<br>
Gibco). The hippocampi and cortices were dissected out and pooled according to tissue-type.<br>
Tissue was trypsinized for 15 min (1mg/ml trypsin-HBSS; Worthington), rinsed with fresh<br>
HBSS, incubated in trypsin inhibitor (1mg/ml; Sigma) for 5 min, rinsed again with fresh<br>
HBSS and then triturated in 1ml fresh HBSS with a fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociated<br>
cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well onto poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates<br>
(Collaborative BioScience). Each well contained 100µl of Eagle's Minimal Essential Media<br>
(MEM; Gibco) supplemented with 26mM NaHCO3 (Sigma), 56mM glucose (Sigma), 15mM<br>
KCl (Sigma), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 1.1mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 10% (v/v) heat-<br>
inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 0.001% gentamicin sulfate (Sigma) (pH 7.4).<br>
Cells were allowed to attach for 24h in a humidified 37°C 5% CO2 incubator before<br>
experimental treatment. The culture media was aspirated and exchanged with fresh media<br>
every 3 days.<br>
Neurite Outgrowth Assay<br>
Twenty-four hours after plating, cultures were treated with vehicle (PBS+0.1% BSA),<br>
100ng of various growth factors (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Promega), glial-<br>
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Promega), nerve growth factor (NGF; Boehringer<br>
Mannheim), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Boehringer Mannheim), insulin-like<br>
growth factor -1 (IGF-1; Boehringer Mannheim), neurotrophin-3 (NT3; Calbiochem),<br>
neurotrophin-4 (NT4; Calbiochem), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; Calbiochem),<br>
epidermal growth factor (EGF; Calbiochem), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;<br>
Calbiochem)), or Epo mimetic peptides (EMP1, EMP6, EMP9, EMP23 and EMP27; diluted<br>
in DPBS+0.1% BSA; 10fM - 10nM; Table 1). Each treatment condition was run in<br>
quadruplicate. On the third day in culture, the media was aspirated off and replaced with<br>
fresh media and test compound. At one week in culture, the cells were fixed with 10%<br>
phosphate-buffered formalin for 15min, then rinsed with DPBS (Sigma) and placed in<br>
blocking serum for 30 min (horse serum; 1:50 dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs). Cultures<br>
were rinsed again with DPBS and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 hr (microtubule-<br>
associated protein-2 (MAP-2) is a selective marker for dendritic processes; anti-mouse<br>
monoclonal (Chemicon); 1:1000 dilution of MAP-2 in antibody diluent (Zymed)). Negative<br>
control wells were incubated in antibody diluent alone. Background signal was determined<br>
by blank wells (cell-free) incubated with or without antibody. Cultures were rinsed again<br>
with DPBS and then placed in fluorescein for 1 hr (FITC; anti-mouse IgG; rat adsorbed; 1:50<br>
dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs). Cultures were rinsed a final time with DPBS and then the<br>
plates were read on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader. Neurite outgrowth was<br>
expressed as percent change from control (vehicle; mean fluorescence ± SEM).<br>
Results<br>
Neurite outgrowth study: Cultures treated with EMP's resulted in a significant<br>
increase in neurite outgrowth as measured by MAP2-FITC immunofluorescence. The neurite<br>
outgrowth promoting effect was concentration dependent with maximal activity observed at<br>
pM levels (Figures 9-18). The results indicate that EMP's displayed different activity<br>
profiles. At the concentrations tested, EMP-1 and 6 displayed typical bell-shaped dose-<br>
response profiles in hippocampal cultures with peak activity observed between 30-300pM<br>
(83-117% increase over vehicle). EMP-9 and 27 exhibited a flat response profile in<br>
hippocampal cultures with peak activity observed at similar concentrations as EMP-1 and 6,<br>
but the amplitude of the response was greatly attenuated (29-32% increase over vehicle).<br>
EMP-23 had a modest response to EPO in hippocampal cultures with peak activity observed<br>
between 30pM-lnM that led to a 43-46% increase over vehicle response. In the cortical<br>
cultures, EMP-1,9 and 27 exhibited response profiles similar to most known growth factors -<br>
a flat response overall with maximal activity occurring between 30-300pM reaching 32-40%<br>
above the vehicle response. EMP-6 and 23 displayed typical bell-shaped dose-response<br>
profiles with peak activity observed between 30-300pM resulting in a 68-87% increase in<br>
outgrowth over vehicle response levels. Overall, EMP-6 promoted robust neurite outgrowth<br>
activity in both hippocampal and cortical cultures; whereas, EMP-1 showed selective effects<br>
in hippocampal cultures over cortical cultures and EMP-23 effects were greater in cortical<br>
cultures than hippocampal cells. EMP-9 and 27 neurite outgrowth responses were less<br>
impressive overall.<br>
A comparison between the EMP's and known growth factors indicated that they<br>
exhibit regional differences in their neurite outgrowth promoting abilities. The EMP's ability<br>
to increase neurite outgrowth in cortical cultures was greater than or equal to that of known<br>
growth factors (Figure 9-18). This observation is compelling and important since few factors<br>
have such effects on cortical cells. On the other hand, many growth factors exert strong<br>
outgrowth responses in the hippocampus (38-86% over control). Compared to such growth<br>
factors, the EMP's showed moderate yet robust outgrowth promoting activity; however, they<br>
displayed superior activity over BDNF, NGF and VEGF.<br>
Discussion<br>
EMP's promote neurite outgrowth in mammalian cells. The effect was robust for<br>
hippocampal and cortical cells. The neurite outgrowth promoting effect, was superior to that<br>
of various growth factors. The effect was potent with efficacy observed at picomolar<br>
concentrations.<br>
It should also be specified that the data are particularly important, considering that<br>
very few growth factors or mimetics are effective in cerebral cortical neurons in promoting<br>
neurite outgrowth. It is particularly relevant that this activity of the EMPs was observed at<br>
sub-picomolar / picomolar concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
EPQ protects aginst ischemic injury<br>
Subjects<br>
Male spontaneous hypertensive rats (Charles River) weighing between 250-300g<br>
were weighed and then anesthetized with ketamine (100mg/ml)/xylazine (20mg/ml) cocktail<br>
(1.2ml/kg; i.p.)- The level of anesthetic was assessed by corneal reflex (air puff to eye) and<br>
leg jerk in response to tail or foot pinch. Once the rat was anesthetized, it was placed on a<br>
small animal surgical board and restrained during the surgical procedure. The rat's body<br>
temperature was monitored continuously with a rectal probe and maintained at 37°C with a<br>
homeostatic heating pad.<br>
Experimental model of cerebral ischemia<br>
Rats were rendered ischemic by tandem occlusion of the left common carotid artery<br>
and the left middle cerebral artery for 2h followed by 22h of reperfusion using a modification<br>
of the technique described by Brint and co-workers (J. Cereb Blood Flow Metab 8:474-485,<br>
1988). Specifically, the left CCA was isolated through an incision in the ventral surface of<br>
the neck. For isolation of the ipsilateral MCA, a second incision was made between the<br>
lateral canthus of the left eye and the corresponding external auditor)' canal to bare the<br>
underlying skull. The MCA was exposed through a 5mm burrhole drilled 2-3mm rostral to<br>
the fusion of the zygomatic arch and the squamosal bone under direct visualization with a<br>
Zeiss operating microscope. The dura was opened with a sterile 26g needle and a platinum<br>
alloy wire (0.1mm diameter) was inserted beneath the MCA just superior to the inferior<br>
cortical vein. The MCA was temporarily occluded by elevation and compression of the vessel<br>
across the alloy wire, as described by Aronowski and colleagues (Stroke, 25:2235-2240,<br>
1994). Concurrently, the CCA was occluded with an aneurysm clip. The duration of<br>
occlusion of the CCA and the MCA was 2h. At the end of this period, the wire and the clip<br>
were carefully removed to allow reperfusion of the vessels and the incision area was sutured<br>
shut The rat was placed in an isolation cage to recover before returning to bis home cage. .<br>
Study Design<br>
Study I: EPO and vehicle delivered via osmotic mini-pump<br>
Twenty-hours prior to the onset of ischemia, an osmotic mini-pump (Model 1003D;<br>
Alza) filled with vehicle or EPO was placed between the scapula of the rat. A<br>
catheter attached to the pump was inserted and tethered within the right jugular vein<br>
for continuous infusion of drug at a rate of 1µl/hr. Rats were divided into five groups:<br>
(1) sham-operated vehicle-treated, (2) ischemic vehicle treated, (3) ischemic<br>
l.32U/day EPO treated, (4) ischemic 132U/day EPO treated and (5) ischemic<br>
1321U/day EPO treated. On Day Two, rats were rendered ischemic as described<br>
above. Twenty-two hours later, the rats were evaluated for behavioral performance, a<br>
blood sample was collected for terminal plasma levels of EPO and then the rat was<br>
euthanized, brain removed, sectioned and stained for histological analysis.<br>
Study D: EPO and vehicle delivered as a single intravenous bolus injection<br>
On Day One, the rats were rendered ischemic as described above. Rats were divided<br>
into four groups: (1) ischemic vehicle treated, (2) ischemic 1000U/kg EPO treated, (3)<br>
ischemic 2500U/kg EPO treated and (4) 5000U/kg EPO treated. Fifteen minutes<br>
post-occlusion, the rats received vehicle or EPO as an intravenous bolus injection.<br>
Twenty-two hours later, the rats were evaluated for behavioral performance, a blood<br>
sample was collected for terminal plasma levels of EPO and then the rat was<br>
euthanized, brain removed, sectioned and stained for histological analysis.<br>
Study III: EPO and vehicle delivered as repeat intravenous bolus injections<br>
On Day One, the rats were rendered ischemic as described above. Rats were divided<br>
into two groups: (1) ischemic vehicle treated and (2) ischemic 2500U/kg EPO treated.<br>
Drug was administered as an intravenous bolus at 15min, 2h, 4h and 6h post-<br>
occlusion for a total dose of 10,000U/kg. Twenty-two hours later, the rats were<br>
evaluated for behavioral performance, a blood sample was collected for terminal<br>
plasma levels of EPO and then the rat was euthanized, brain removed, sectioned and<br>
stained for histological analysis.<br>
Outcome measures<br>
Plasma Determinations: Blood samples were collected from each rat via the orbital<br>
sinus at the time of sacrifice. Plasma was separated out, frozen and analyzed by EPO ELISA<br>
for determination of plasma concentration (U/ml).<br>
Infarct Volume: Brains were removed, blocked into lmm slabs and stained with<br>
2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride dye (TTC; Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature.<br>
Stained sections were stored in 10% buffered formalin at 4oC. Sections were visualized by a<br>
Nikon SMZ-U microdissecting scope. Images of each brain section were captured with a<br>
CCD camera and processed using Image Pro Phase HI software in order to calculate infarct<br>
volume.<br>
Results<br>
Study I: EPO given at 132 or 1321U/day as a continuous infusion via osmotic mini-<br>
pump significantly reduced infarct volume (Figure 19). Plasma concentrations correlated<br>
with the protective effect (Figure 20).<br>
Study II: EPO given as a single iv bolus 15 min post-occlusion did not protect against<br>
ischemic damage in this model at 1000, 2500 or 5000U/kg (Figure 21). Plasma<br>
concentrations were low in each group (Figure 22).<br>
Study III: EPO given as a repeat iv bolus of 2500U/kg at lSmin, 2h, 4h and 6h post-<br>
occlusion led to a significant decrease in infarct volume (Figure 23). Plasma concentrations<br>
are presently being determined (Figure 24).<br>
Discussion<br>
Data support that continuous or repeat dosing with low to moderate concentrations of<br>
EPO can significantly reduce infarct volume in spontaneous hypertensive rats rendered<br>
ischemic via the transient tandem occlusion of the CCA and MCA. The results also support<br>
that there is a critical relationship between the amount and timing of EPO administration for<br>
the protective effect to occur. Low doses of EPO given over an extended period of time can<br>
be more beneficial than high doses given the same way or as a single bolus infusion. This is<br>
in agreement with the in vitro data indicating that EPO maximal protective effect is observed<br>
at low doses (pM) and actually looses efficacy at higher doses (µM).<br>
