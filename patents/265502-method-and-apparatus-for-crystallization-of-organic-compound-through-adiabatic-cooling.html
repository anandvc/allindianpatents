				<td>METHOD FOR ADIABATIC COOLING TYPE CRYSTALLIZATION OF ORGANIC<br>
COMPOUND AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for adiabatic<br>
cooling type crystallization of organic compound and an<br>
apparatus therefore, and more particularly to a method and an<br>
apparatus suitable for obtaining paraxylene crystal.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Separation and purification of a certain kind of isomer<br>
mixture are difficult in distillation operation because boiling<br>
points of components constituting the mixture are close to each<br>
other. However, there are many cases where melting points are<br>
largely different depending on the difference in molecular<br>
structures, and therefore, separation by crystallization<br>
operation is often effective.<br>
There are methods of extraction crystallization and<br>
addition compound crystallization in which a solvent-agent<br>
(extractant, additive) is added to a two-component eutectic<br>
system or a multi-component eutectic system as a third<br>
component; however, these are disadvantageous to recover the<br>
1<br><br>
solvent-agent.<br>
In this regard, a method in which a liquified gas<br>
component is used as a coolant is advantageous because its<br>
recovery is easy.<br>
The present inventors have found that it is effective<br>
to carry out crystallization operation, with the use of propane<br>
(propene, ethylene, carbonic acid gas, ammonia, or the like)<br>
as a direct injecting coolant, for a multi-component eutectic<br>
system such as xylene mixture<br>
(m-xylene+o-xylene+ethylbenzene+p-xylene system) that is a raw<br>
material for a typical p-xylene production in a petrochemical<br>
industrial process or a xylene mixture<br>
(m-xylene+o-xylene+p-xylene system) after isomerization<br>
reaction.<br>
In this case, it is possible to carry out the<br>
crystallization operation in a jacket type crystallizer;<br>
however the crystallization is necessary to be carried out by<br>
cooling p-xylene in the multi-component eutectic system to about<br>
-30 degrees C to -60 degrees C. Therefore, it is required to<br>
provide the crystallizer with a cooling surface scraper<br>
mechanics and a refrigeration unit by which the evaporated<br>
coolant from the jacket is compressed by a compressor, for<br>
example, under a high pressure of 20 atmospheres, followed by<br>
2<br><br>
allowing this to be liquefied and circulated to the jacket.<br>
Using such a crystallizer results in not only an increase<br>
in power cost of the compressor but also increases in facility<br>
cost and maintenance cost because the crystallizer has to be<br>
provided with a cooling surface scraper mechanics that requires<br>
complex and frequent maintenance.<br>
On the other hand, another system in which a heat pump<br>
is used is conceivable (Patent document 1: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1992-327542 ), but the<br>
system is not necessarily suitable in view of facility cost to<br>
construct the heat pump.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Main objects of the present invention are to provide<br>
a method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization of organic<br>
compound and an apparatus therefore in which running cost<br>
(including maintenance cost) and facility cost can be reduced.<br>
Other objects of the present invention are to provide<br>
a method and an apparatus suitable for crystallization of<br>
p-xylene.<br>
The present invention to solve the above problems is<br>
3<br><br>
carried out as follows.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
A method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization of<br>
organic compound comprising:<br>
carrying out adiabatic cooling, as for crystallization<br>
operation of target organic compound and evaporation operation<br>
of a coolant which is directly introduced in a crystallizer for<br>
a mixture solution of a target organic compound containing the<br>
coolant;<br>
taking out crystal slurry produced by the operation from<br>
the crystallizer;<br>
pressurizing evaporated vapor to a pressure higher than<br>
the operation pressure in the crystallizer by a compressor and<br>
then introducing the pressurized coolant vapor to an absorption<br>
condenser, removing the heat of absorption and condensation,<br>
cooling the mixture solution of organic compound and the<br>
evaporated coolant vapor that has been pressurized, while<br>
allowing them to contact each other in the absorption condenser;<br>
and<br>
introducing the crystal slurry taken out of the<br>
crystallizer to a purification means to purify the crystal, and<br>
introducing a clarified liquid in the purification means to at<br>
least one of the crystallizer and the absorption condenser.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
When the adiabatic cooling and the evaporation operation<br>
4<br><br>
of the coolant are carried out for the mixture solution of the<br>
target organic compound containing the coolant in the<br>
crystallizer, heat of crystallization is taken away in<br>
association with evaporation of substantially only the liquid<br>
coolant component, and crystal is crystallized. The evaporated<br>
vapor is pressurized to a pressure higher than the operation<br>
pressure in the crystallizer by the compressor, and then<br>
introduced to the absorption condenser for condensation. The<br>
reason why the evaporated vapor is pressurized to a pressure<br>
higher than the operation pressure in the crystallizer by the<br>
compressor is that the vapor is pressurized by the compressor<br>
in order to secure a temperature difference for the condensation.<br>
In the absorption condenser, since the evaporated vapor is<br>
brought into contact with the mixture solution of organic<br>
compound having a lower vapor pressure, the boiling point rises,<br>
thereby raising the temperature at which absorption and<br>
condensation can take place. Accordingly, a smaller degree of<br>
pressurization suffices the need, and a smaller energy input<br>
from outside suffices the need for the condensation.<br>
Continuous crystallization operation can be carried out<br>
by introducing condensate liquid from the absorption condenser<br>
to the crystallizer. Taking crystallization of p-xylene as an<br>
example, propane is used as a coolant, the pressure in the<br>
crystallizer is, for example, normal atmospheric pressure, and<br>
the pressure in the absorption condenser is, for example, about<br>
5<br><br>
eight atmospheric pressure by means of pressurization by the<br>
compressor.<br>
According to the above operation, crystallization<br>
operation is possible without constructing the crystallizer as<br>
a pressure resistant container. When at least a compressor and<br>
an absorption condenser are included as other necessary<br>
apparatuses, crystallization operation can be carried out, and<br>
therefore, an expensive structure installed with a<br>
refrigeration unit that was used in the prior art is not<br>
necessary, thus giving rise to an economical apparatus in view<br>
of entire system cost and running cost.<br>
The crystal slurry produced in the crystallizer is taken<br>
out and purified by the purification means to enhance the purity<br>
for making a product. Since the target component remains in<br>
the clarified liquid in the purification means, the clarified<br>
liquid can be introduced to at least one of the crystallizer<br>
and the absorption condenser. Accordingly, the recovery rate<br>
of the crystal of the target component can be enhanced. When<br>
the clarified liquid is sent back to the crystallizer, an<br>
absorption amount of the coolant (gas) is increased, thereby<br>
allowing the cooling heat in the crystallizer to have an<br>
allowance.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
6<br><br><br>
The method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound according to claim 1, where the crystal<br>
slurry taken out of the crystallizer is introduced to the<br>
purification means after it is concentrated by a concentration<br>
means.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
The crystal slurry taken out of the crystallizer is<br>
introduced to the purification means after it is concentrated<br>
by the concentration means such as a centrifuge, a filter, or<br>
a liquid cyclone preferable in terms of apparatus cost. Thus,<br>
not only can crystal having high purity be obtained by the<br>
purification means but also the purification efficiency in the<br>
purification means is enhanced because the mother liquid is<br>
separated in advance.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
The method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound according to claim 1, where the clarified<br>
liquid in the clarified portion in the crystallizer is<br>
introduced to the absorption condenser.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
By sending back the clarified liquid in the clarified<br>
portion (upper portion) in the crystallizer to the absorption<br>
condenser, condensation of the coolant vapor can be carried out<br>
7<br><br>
at a further lower pressure. In this case, it is preferred that<br>
the clarified liquid is allowed to combine with the original<br>
liquid and supplied to the absorption condenser for absorption<br>
and condensation in a condition of a lowered concentration of<br>
the coolant.<br><aspect according to claim><br>

organic compound according to claim 1, where the purification<br>

liquid discharge means in the upper portion and a heating means<br>
in the lower portion, to which the crystal slurry taken out of<br>
the crystallizer is introduced, in the purification column, the<br>
crystal moving to the lower portion is molten by the heating<br>
means in the lower portion, part of the molten matter or the<br>
molten liquid containing the crystal is taken out for making<br>
a product, the other portion is allowed to rise, as a reflux<br>
liquid, through the crystal group that is falling, the mother<br>
liquid is washed out with this reflux liquid, the purified<br>
crystal is allowed to precipitate downward, and the clarified<br>
liquid that has reached the clarified liquid discharge means<br>
in the upper portion is introduced to at least one of the<br>
crystallizer and the absorption condenser.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
As to the crystal slurry taken out of the crystallizer,<br>
8<br><br>
when a product with higher purity is obtained, purification with<br>
the use of the purification means is preferred. With the use<br>
of the vertical melt purification means according to claim 4,<br>
crystal with high purity can be obtained by countercurrent<br>
contact of the crystal moving to the lower portion with the<br>
liquid rising as a reflux liquid.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
The method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound according to claim 1, where the purification<br>
means is an vertical melt purification column having a clarified<br>
liquid discharge means in the lower portion and a heating means<br>
in the upper portion, to which the crystal slurry taken out of<br>
the crystallizer is introduced, in the purification column, the<br>
crystal moving to the upper portion is molten by the heating<br>
means in the upper portion, part of the molten matter or the<br>
molten liquid containing the crystal is taken out for making<br>
a product, the other portion is allowed to fall, as a reflux<br>
liquid, through the crystal group that is rising, the mother<br>
liquid is washed out with this reflux liquid, the purified<br>
crystal is allowed to move upward, and the clarified liquid that<br>
has reached the clarified liquid discharge means in the lower<br>
portion is introduced to at least one of the crystallizer and<br>
the absorption condenser.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
9<br><br>
The vertical melt purification column according to claim<br>
5 has a structure in which the upper portion and the lower portion<br>
are in reverse to those in the structure according to claim 4,<br>
and purification can also be carried out by this vertical melt<br>
purification column.<br><aspect according to claim><br>

of organic compound according to claim 1, where the operation<br>
pressure in the crystallizer is vacuum or equal to or lower than<br>
four atmospheric pressure.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
As to the operation pressure (evaporation pressure) in<br>
the crystallizer, the operation is preferably carried out at<br>
around normal atmospheric pressure and at most at four<br>
atmospheric pressure when a pressure resistance property<br>
required for the crystallizer and the like, the separation<br>
method of produced crystal, and the apparatus are taken into<br>
consideration.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
The method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound according to claim 1, where the<br>
concentration of the coolant in the absorption condensate<br>
introduced from the absorption condenser to the crystallizer<br>
10<br><br>
is set to from 1 to 70%.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
When the concentration of the coolant in the absorption<br>
condensate becomes higher, the crystallization point becomes<br>
lower, and the vapor pressure also becomes lower. When the<br>
concentration of the coolant in the absorption condensate<br>
becomes lower, the vapor pressure becomes lower in relation to<br>
the partial pressure. Accordingly, the highest point of the<br>

The method is advantageous to obtain paraxylene<br>
crystal.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
The method for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound according to claim 1, where the mixture<br>
solution of organic compound is a hexane mixture containing<br>
11<br><br>
cyclohexane, from which cyclohexane crystal is obtained.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
The method is advantageous to obtain cyclohexane<br>
crystal.<br><aspect according to claim><br>
An apparatus for adiabatic cooling type crystallization<br>
of organic compound comprising:<br>
a crystallizer in which adiabatic evaporation operation<br>
of a coolant is carried out for a mixture solution of a target<br>
organic compound containing the coolant;<br>
a means to take out crystal slurry produced by this<br>
operation from the crystallizer;<br>
a compressor that pressurizes evaporated vapor in the<br>
crystallizer to a pressure higher than the operation pressure<br>
in the crystallizer and introduces the vapor to an absorption<br>
condenser;<br>
the absorption condenser that carries out condensation<br>
while bringing the mixture solution of organic compound into<br>
contact with the evaporated vapor that has been pressurized;<br>
a means to introduce this absorption condensate to the<br>
crystallizer;<br>
a purification means to carry out crystal purification<br>
of the crystal slurry taken out of the crystallizer; and<br>
a means to introduce a clarified liquid in the<br>
12<br><br>
purification means to at least one of the crystallizer and the<br>
absorption condenser.<br>
(Advantageous effect)<br>
The apparatus offers an advantageous effect similar to<br>
that of the aspect according to claim 1.<br>
To summarize the effects described in the above sections<br>
of advantageous effect, cooling (crystallization) is possible<br>
in the facility for cooling crystallization without installing<br>
an unavoidable apparatus to scrape crystal that is crystallized<br>
on the cooling surface, and a necessary amount of energy consumed<br>
for the cooling can be reduced, thereby making it possible to<br>
reduce the running cost and facility cost. Further, the method<br>
and the apparatus are suitable for crystallization of p-xylene.<br>
Furthermore, since purification is carried out by the<br>
purification means, the purity of the crystal can be enhanced.<br>
Still further, since the target component remains in the<br>
clarified liguid in the purification means, the crystallization<br>
efficiency becomes higher by introducing the clarified liquid<br>
to at least one of the crystallizer and the absorption condenser.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be explained in detail.<br><first embodiment><br>
Fig. 2 represents a first embodiment, which includes<br>
an absorption condenser 10, a crystallizer 20, a compressor 30,<br>
and a solid-liquid separation means to take out crystal portion.<br>
A mixture solution 1 of a target organic compound<br>
containing a coolant (target liquid for crystallization<br>
operation, for example, a liquid of multi-component eutectic<br>
mixture containing p-xylene and its isomer) is introduced to<br>
the absorption condenser 10 and allowed to absorb coolant vapor<br>
(for example, propane) here to be condensed, making a<br>
homogeneous liquid mixed with the coolant. The liquid is<br>
introduced to the crystallizer 20 via a piping path 61 from a<br>
temporary storage tank 10A for absorption condensate, and<br>
adiabatic cooling and evaporation operation of the coolant are<br>
carried out for the condensed liquid containing the coolant in<br>
the crystallizer 20.<br>
14<br><br>
Crystal slurry produced by this operation is taken out<br>
of the crystallizer 20 by a pump 62 and is preferred to be<br>
purified with the use of a purification means in order to obtain<br>
a product with higher purity. Examples in Figs. 2 to 4 are<br>
examples that the crystal slurry taken out of the crystallizer<br>
20 is introduced to an vertical melt purification column 70<br>
having a clarified liquid discharge means in the upper portion<br>
and a heating means 70a in the lower portion. The vertical melt<br>
purification column 70 constitutes a solid-liquid separation<br>
means to take out crystal portion.<br>
In the purification column 70, crystal moving to the<br>
lower portion is molten by the heating means 70a in the lower<br>
portion, part of the molten matter or the molten liquid<br>
containing the crystal is taken out for making a product, the<br>
other portion is allowed to rise, as a reflux liquid, through<br>
the crystal group that is falling, the mother liquid is washed<br>
out with this reflux liquid, the purified crystal is allowed<br>
to precipitate downward, the mixed mother liquid of the reflux<br>
liquid that has reached the clarified liquid discharge means<br>
in the upper portion and the mother liquid is discharged to be<br>
sent back to the crystallizer 20 in the previous stage via a<br>
piping path 67. Crystal Cr is taken out of the lower portion.<br>
It is well known that purification can be carried out<br>
15<br><br>
by this kind of countercurrent contact of crystal moving to the<br>
lower portion with the mother liquid rising as a reflux liquid<br>
(for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 1994-91103), and therefore the detail is not<br>
described here. Note that the purification means of the present<br>
invention includes a mode in which the upper portion and the<br>
lower portion of a purification column are reversed because of<br>
a specific gravity of the crystal relative to the mother liquid.<br>
By the vertical melt purification column 70,<br>
purification can be carried out by countercurrent contact of<br>
the crystal moving to the lower portion with the liquid rising<br>
as a reflux liquid. In this case, the mixed mother liquid of<br>
the reflux liquid that has reached the clarified liquid<br>
discharge means in the upper portion and the mother liquid are<br>
discharged to be sent back to the crystallizer 20 in the previous<br>
stage, thereby making it possible to crystallize the target<br>
component and enhance the recovery rate of the crystal.<br>
On the other hand, the evaporated vapor in the<br>
crystallizer 20 is allowed to pass a piping path 63, pressurized<br>
to a pressure higher than the operation pressure in the<br>
crystallizer 20 by the compressor 30, and then introduced to<br>
the absorption condenser 10. While bringing the mixture<br>
solution of organic compound (mixture solution 1) into contact<br>
with the evaporated vapor that has been pressurized in the<br>
16<br><br>
absorption condenser 10, absorption and condensation are<br>
carried out by cooling with cooling heat that a cooling medium<br>
2 (for example, cooling water in cooling column or brine in<br>
freezer) has, and this absorption condensate is introduced to<br>
the crystallizer 20.<br>
When adiabatic cooling and evaporation operation for the<br>
liquid coolant component are carried out, in the crystallizer<br>
20, for the mixture solution of the target organic compound<br>
containing the liquid coolant component, crystallization heat<br>
is taken away in association with the evaporation of the liquid<br>
coolant component, and crystal is crystallized.<br>
The reason why the evaporated vapor is pressurized to<br>
a pressure higher than the operation pressure in the<br>
crystallizer 20 by the compressor 30 before being introduced<br>
to the absorption condenser 10 is that a temperature difference<br>
between the crystallizer 20 and the absorption condenser 10 is<br>
secured by means of pressurization by the compressor 30 in order<br>
to recondense the coolant at a temperature much higher than the<br>
operation temperature of the crystallizer 20.<br>
In the absorption condenser 10, the evaporated vapor<br>
is brought into contact with the solution of the organic compound<br>
having high boiling points, and therefore the boiling point<br>
rises, thereby raising the temperature at which absorption and<br>
17<br><br>
condensation can take place. Accordingly, a smaller energy<br>
input from outside suffices the need for absorption and<br>
condensation. It is possible to carry out continuous<br>
crystallization operation by introducing the absorption<br>
condensate in the absorption condenser 10 to the crystallizer<br>
20.<br>
Taking crystallization of p-xylene as an example,<br>
propane is used as a coolant, the pressure in the crystallizer<br>
20 is, for example, normal atmospheric pressure, and the<br>
pressure in the absorption condenser 10 is, for example, about<br>
eight atmospheric pressure by means of pressurization by the<br>
compressor 30.<br>
According to the operation, crystallization operation<br>
is possible without constructing the crystallizer 20 as a<br>
pressure resistant container. When at least the crystallizer<br>
20, the compressor 30, and the absorption condenser 10 are<br>
included as necessary apparatuses, crystallization operation<br>
can be carried out, and therefore, an expensive structure<br>
installed with a refrigeration system that was used in the prior<br>
art is not necessary, thus giving rise to an economical apparatus<br>
in view of entire system cost and running cost.<br>
The clarified liquid (mother liquid Mo) in the clarified<br>
portion in the crystallizer 20 can be discharged to the outside<br>
18<br><br>
of the system through a piping path 64.<br><second embodiment><br>
In a second embodiment shown in Fig. 3, not only is the<br>
clarified liquid (mother liquid Mo) in the upper clarified<br>
portion in the crystallizer 20 discharged to the outside of the<br>
system but also part of the clarified liquid is sent back to<br>
the absorption condenser 10. By sending back the clarified<br>
liquid to the absorption condenser 10 as the mother liquid,<br>
condensation of the coolant vapor can be carried out at a further<br>
lower pressure. In this case, absorption and condensation can<br>
be carried out in a condition of a lowered concentration of the<br>
coolant by allowing the vapor to combine with the mixture<br>
solution of organic compound (mixture solution 1) and<br>
subsequently being supplied to the absorption condenser 10.<br><third embodiment><br>
Fig. 4 represents a third embodiment. After the crystal<br>
slurry taken out of the crystallizer 20 is concentrated by a<br>
concentration means 40, the concentrated component is<br>
introduced to the purification means.<br>
For the concentration, a centrifuge or a filter can also<br>
be used; however, a cyclone that is economically advantageous<br>
is adopted in the example in Fig. 4.<br>
Since the coolant is contained in the liquid Mo discharged<br>
to the outside of the system by the concentration means 40 in<br>
19<br><br>
a state where the coolant is dissolved in the discharged liquid<br>
Mo, the coolant can be recovered by a distillation column in<br>
the subsequent stage or the like, and further supplied as make-up<br>
to a suction means of the compressor 30 as a coolant gas 1A.<br>
On the other hand, the clarified liquid separated in the<br>
melt purification column 70 can be sent back to the absorption<br>
condenser 10 via a piping path 66.<br><fourth embodiment><br>
With respect to the vertical melt purification column<br>
70, purification can by carried out by an vertical melt<br>
purification column 71 of a structure in which the upper portion<br>
and the lower portion are reversed. In other words, as shown<br>
in Fig. 5, a clarified liquid discharge means is arranged in<br>
the lower portion, a heating means (not shown) is arranged in<br>
the upper portion, the crystal slurry taken out of the<br>
crystallizer 20 is introduced to the vertical melt purification<br>
column 71 having a mechanical means to form mechanically a<br>
crystal-filling layer inside, for example, a structure provided<br>
with a crystal bed scraper 71a and a filter 71b that reciprocates<br>
like a piston, and in the purification column 71, the crystal<br>
moving to the upper portion is molten by the heating means<br>
arranged in the upper portion, part of the molten matter is taken<br>
out for making a product, the other portion is allowed to fall<br>
as a reflux liquid, the rising crystal is washed of the mother<br>
liquid with this reflux liquid in the crystal-filling layer,<br>
20<br><br>
the purified crystal is compacted by the mechanical means in<br>
the upper portion, and the mixed mother liquid of the reflux<br>
liquid that has reached the discharge means of mother liquid<br>
in the lower portion and the mother liquid is discharged to be<br>
sent back to the absorption condenser 10 via, for example, a<br>
piping path 66A. It is, of course, possible to send the mixed<br>
mother liquid to the crystallizer 20. A condenser and a<br>
compressor are provided to attach to the upper portion of the<br>
purification column 71.<br><explanation of a method for crystallization><br>
Taking a benzene-cyclohexane system as an example, the<br>
method for crystallization is explained.<br>
In common production in chemical industry, cyclohexane<br>
is produced by hydrogenation of benzene.<br>
C6H6+3H2 -&gt; C6H12<br>
In this hydrogenation reaction, the following impurities<br>
are produced by side reactions.<br>
methylcyclopentane<br>
n-hexane<br>
n-pentane<br>
methylcyclohexane<br>
In addition to these, toluene, and paraffins contained<br>
in the raw material benzene are included.<br>
In such a case, what is the most difficult in obtaining<br>
21<br><br>
cyclohexane with high purity is that it becomes almost<br>
impossible to separate cyclohexane by distillation when<br>
unreacted benzene is contained. The boiling point of benzene<br>
at normal atmospheric pressure is 80.75 degrees C, and that of<br>
cyclohexane is 80.16 degrees C. The difference between them<br>
is only 0.59 degree C. Further, the lowest azeotropic point<br>
(77.62 degrees C) is around 54mol% of cyclohexane.<br>
On the other hand, as is clear from the solid-liquid<br>
equilibrium diagram of a eutectic composition of<br>
propane-benzene-cyclohexane system shown in Fig. 1, a method<br>
of separation and purification by crystallization can be adopted<br>
when cyclohexane with high purity is desired to be obtained.<br>
In this method, it becomes possible to remove impurities such<br>
as methylcyclopentane contained together in a small amount at<br>
the same time.<br>
In other words, in the phase diagram, a solid-liquid<br>
equilibrium line of the two-component system consisting of<br>
cyclohexane and benzene can be obtained. The content of<br>
impurities in a very small amount only slightly lowers the<br>
crystallization point curve, and there is no large substantial<br>
difference. When it is intended here that a mixed raw material<br>
rich in cyclohexane is cooled to crystallize cyclohexane,<br>
crystallization starts when the temperature reaches the<br>
solid-liquid line on the left side. Next, in the method for<br>
22<br><br>
adiabatic cooling using propane, when a supply liquid and<br>
propane are mixed and cooling is started by releasing the<br>
pressure, crossing the solid-liquid equilibrium line (the line<br>
is drawn as component without propane) of the three-component<br>
system having added propane takes place. When cooling the<br>
liquid along the line to near the eutectic point, crystal of<br>
cyclohexane is crystallized, and this crystal is separated from<br>
the mother liquid.<br>
Such operation is continuously carried out in the<br>
facility structured according to the present invention.<br>
The mother liquid separated from the cyclohexane crystal<br>
is subjected to propane removal, mixed with the raw material,<br>
and fed back. Note that a mixed liquid system of benzene and<br>
cyclohexane is a eutectic system in the range of all<br>
concentrations. The crystallization point of pure benzene is<br>
5.5 degrees C and that of cyclohexane is 5.7 degrees C.<br>
From the explanation of this principle, it will be obvious<br>
that cyclohexane crystal can be obtained from a eutectic<br>
composition of propane-benzene-cyclohexane system. Further,<br>
according to the present invention, it will be also clear that<br>
a low cost crystallization process is provided for their<br>
separation.<br><other explanations><br>
23<br><br>
The above embodiments are examples in which one<br>
crystallizer is used. However, the present invention also aims<br>
at a structure provided with a plurality of crystallizers. In<br>
a facility provided with a plurality of crystallizers, crystal<br>
slurry in a crystallizer in a previous stage is introduced to<br>
a crystallizer in the subsequent stage, followed by carrying<br>
out further crystallization. And a crystallizer in the final<br>
stage is combined with the purification means.<br>
In this mode, when the clarified liquid in the<br>
purification means is sent back to a crystallizer, it is<br>
desirable to send it back to the crystallizer in the final stage,<br>
and when it is sent back to the absorption condenser, it is<br>
desirable to introduce it to the absorption condenser attached<br>
to the initial stage.<br>
When the coolant is a gas component, the solvent-agent<br>
dissolved in the mother liquid is removed as a gas by contacting<br>
the molten liquid refluxed from the lower portion as a<br>
countercurrent washing liquid in the purification column,<br>
showing a stripping effect, and therefore it is possible to<br>
obtain a high purification effect compared with a case in which<br>
crystal is separated from the crystal slurry by simple<br>
solid-liquid separation.<br>
Further, in the present invention, a purification column<br>
to form a crystal bed by a mechanically driven power can also<br>
24<br><br>
be used, as in the example of Fig. 5, in place of the gravity<br>
precipitation type purification columns shown in Figs. 2 to 4.<br>
In this case, the concentration means in the above embodiment<br>
becomes unnecessary, and the crystal mother liquid can be<br>
discharged to the outside of the system as it is.<br>
The mechanically driven type purification column can<br>
employ any one of the types in which a crystal bed is formed<br>
in the upper portion of the column and a crystal bed is formed<br>
in the lower portion thereof. However, there is a possibility<br>
that generated gas may cause a failure in formation of crystal<br>
bed and reduction in product purity. Therefore, the use of the<br>
type in which a bed is formed in the lower portion is preferred.<br>
Example<br>
Hereinafter, the effects of the present invention are<br>
made clear by showing an example.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
In the following example, crystallization was carried<br>
out by the process shown in Fig. 4. An vertical crystallizer<br>
(300 millimeter diameter x 1.5 meter height, slurry hold-up<br>
capacity of 25 liters) was used as the crystallizer 20, and a<br>
horizontal tube type absorption condenser was used for the<br>
absorption condenser 10.<br>
A raw material of xylene mixture having 80 to 90%<br>
25<br><br>
paraxylene concentration at normal temperature was supplied to<br>
the absorption condenser 10 at a rate of 15 to 25 kg/hr and<br>
condensed at about 30 degrees C while being brought into contact<br>
with and mixed with the vapor pressurized to 0.2 to 0.7<br>
megapascal (MPa) by passing through the compressor 30 from the<br>
crystallizer 20. The obtained condensed liquid was a solution<br>
of xylene mixture containing propane at a concentration of 10<br>
to 30%. This solution was introduced to the crystallizer 20<br>
being run at -10 to 0 degree C under normal atmospheric pressure<br>
for crystallization. The paraxylene crystal slurry obtained<br>
by the crystallization was supplied to the purification column<br>
70 from the crystallizer 20 via a liquid cyclone 40. As the<br>
result, purified paraxylene solution having a purity of equal<br>
to or more than 98 to 99.9% by wt. could be obtained at 4 to<br>
7 kg/hr. The clarified liquid from the cyclone that was the<br>
solution of xylene mixture with propane was discharged to the<br>
outside of the system. The propane in the portion discharged<br>
to the outside of the system in a state that the propane was<br>
dissolved in the clarified liquid was supplied to the suction<br>
means of the compressor 30 as make-up. The concentration of<br>
paraxylene in the clarified liquid was 60 to 80%. The overflow<br>
from the purification column 70 containing a high proportion<br>
of paraxylene was sent back to the absorption condenser 10 as<br>
a liquid for reabsorption.<br>
