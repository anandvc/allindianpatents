A HERBICIDAL COMBINATION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling undesired vegetation in crops of useful plants, for example, monocotyledon crop plants, such as cereal crops, rice, corn, potatoes and sugar cane, by using a synergistic combination of compounds.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable to increase the specific activity of an active ingredient and the reliability of action.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a combination of variable amounts of at least two compounds (sometimes referred to as active ingredients) exhibits a synergistic action that is capable of controlling, either or both pre-emergence and post-emergence, the majority of undesired vegetation occurring especially in crops of useful plants without causing any appreciable damage to the useful plant.<br>
The benefit of the invention, therefore, can be attained by allowing a composition comprising the combination of compounds to act on the undesired vegetation, or by allowing the individual compounds to act on the undesired vegetation, either by applying them simultaneously or in succession.<br>
It has been found that (A) certain thiocarbamates and (B) certain compounds with a mode of action of inhibition of acetolactate synthase (ALS) are particularly effective in controlling undesired vegetation.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a herbicidally synergistic composition for selective control of undesired vegetation which, in addition to comprising customary inert formulation adjuvants, comprises, preferably consists essentially of, as active ingredient, a combination selected from:<br>

The compounds suitable for the combinations of the present invention are described in the e-Pesticide Manual, version 3.0, 13th Edition, Ed. CDC Tomlin, British Crop Protection Council, 2003-04.   The number following the compound name is the entry number given in the Pesticide Manual. Flucetosulfuron is 1-[3-[[[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-2-pyridinyl]-2-fluoropropyl methoxyacetate and is a compound of Lucky Goldstar, the compound having the code DE-742 is 2-Methoxy-4-trifIuoromethyl-pyridine-3-sulfonic acid (5,7-dimethoxy-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrirnidin-2-yl)-amide, and the compound having code KUH 021 is N-{2-((4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)hydroxymethyl)-6-methoxymethyl}phenyl difluromethylsulfonamide and is a compound of Kumiai Chemical.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of controlling undesired vegetation in crops of useful plants, which comprises allowing a composition of the first aspect to act where control is desired, for example, on the undesired vegetation or the locus thereof.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of controlling undesired vegetation in crops of useful plants, which comprises allowing a herbicidally synergistic effective amount of combination (A) and (B) as defined in the first aspect to act where control is desired, for example, on the undesired vegetation or the locus thereof, wherein the compounds are applied simultaneously or in succession in any order.<br><br>
In another aspect, it has been found that combination of prosulfocarb and flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium provides control of certain undesired vegetation.<br>
It is surprising that combinations of the specific compounds defined in the first aspect exceed that expected from additive action of the individual compounds used alone on the undesired vegetation and thus broaden the range of action of the compounds especially in two respects: firstly, the rates of application of the individual compounds are reduced while a good level of action is maintained and, secondly, the combinations according to the invention achieves a high level of undesired vegetation control also in those cases where the individual compounds, in the range of low rates of application, have become useless from the agronomic standpoint.  Further, the result may be a considerable broadening of the spectrum of undesired vegetation controlled by the compounds. The combination according to the invention, while retaining excellent control of undesired vegetation in useful plants, also allows greater flexibility in succeeding crops.<br>
The term "crops of useful plants" is to be understood as plants that have a value (e.g., monetary value) to a grower and includes those, which have been made tolerant to compounds or classes of compounds as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. The term "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Undesired vegetation are those plants that affect the growth and quality of the useful plants and examples include grasses and weeds. A herbicidally effective amount of the combinations of the active ingredients are applied on appropriate areas for controlling the undesired vegetation to allow them to act on the undesired vegetation or the area of cultivation of the crop plants. Areas of cultivation are areas of land on which the crop plants are already growing or in which the seed material of those crop plants has been sown, and also land on which it is intended to grow those crop plants.<br>
The control of the undesired vegetation ensures satisfactory crop yield and quality, and the grower of the crop has often to balance the costs associated with the use of compounds with the resulting yield, but generally an increase of, for example, at least 5% yield of a crop which has undergone compound treatment compared with an untreated crop is considered control by the compound.<br>
The combination according to the invention can be used against a large number of agronomically important undesired vegetation, such as grass weeds, e.g., Alopecurus<br><br>
species, Poa- species, Apera- species, Avena spp., Lolium -species, Bromus-species, Echinochloa spp., Leptochloa spp., Digitaria spp., Phalaris spp., Setaria spp., Brachiaria spp., and tscheamum spp.; broad-leaved weeds, such as Gallium spp., Lamium spp., Geranium spp. (e.g., Geranium rotundifolium), Solanum spp.f Veronica spp., Viola spp. (e.g., Viola tricolor), Alchemilla spp., Kochia spp., Stellaria spp., Polygonum spp., Matricaria spp., Chenocpodium spp., Aethusa cynapum, Amaranthus spp., Galinsoga spp., Monochoria spp., Lindernia spp., Anthemis spp., Sinapis spp., Raphanus spp., Papaver spp., Capsella spp., Rotala spp., Butomus spp., Limnocharis spp., Sphenoclea spp., Commelina spp., Ludwigia spp., Bidens pilosa, Elatine spp., and Kickxia spp.; and the combination also controls annual and perennial sedges, e.g., Scirpus spp. (e..g., Scirpus juncoides), Sagittaria spp., Cyperus spp., Eleocharis spp. and Fimbristylis spp..<br>
In particular, the each of the combinations according to the first aspect can be used against ALS-resistant weeds and ACCase-resistant weeds in crops of useful plants, for example in crops of rice, cereals and maize. Examples of ALS resistant weeds, for example in rice, are Echinocloa gruss galli, Elatine triandria, Lindernia spp., Scirpus juncoides, Monochoria vaginalis, Monochoria korsakowaii; and in cereals, are Alopecurus myr., Chenopodium album, Amaranthus spp., Raphanus raphanistrum, Sinapis spp.r Kochia spp.. Examples of Accase resistant weeds, for example in rice, are Echinochloa crus-galli and Brachiaria spp.; and in cereals, are Alopecurus myr., Lolium spp., Avena spp., Apera spp..<br>
In the instance the combination (A1) and (B1) is used to control ALS-resistant weeds and ACCase-resistant weeds, (B1) preferably further comprises one or more of iodosulfuron, mesosulfuron, triasulfuron, flupyrsulfuron-methyi-sodium and 2-Methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-pyridine-3-sulfonic acid (5,7-dimethoxy-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)-arnide.<br>
The combination according to the invention is suitable for all methods of application conventionally used in agriculture, e.g., pre-emergence application, and post-emergence application. The combination according to the invention is suitable especially for controlling undesired vegetation in crops of useful plants, such as monocotyledon crops, for example: - cereal crops - where examples of undesired vegetation include Alopecurus species, Poa-species, Apera- species, Avena spp., Lolium -species, Bromus-species, Phalaris spp., Gallium spp., Geranium spp. (e.g., Geranium rotundifolium), Veronica spp., Viola spp. (e.g., Viola tricolor), Lamium spp., Stellaria spp., Polygonum spp., Aethusa cynapum,<br><br>

The amount of compounds (A) and (B) used in the combination according to the present invention is such that a herbicidal and synergistic activity is demonstrated and is generally in any effective mixing ratio, but usually an excess of compound (A) is present over compound (B). In an embodiment, the weight ratio of compound (A) to compound (B) is in the range of from 1000:1 to 10:1, preferably 700:1 to 20:1, especially 450:1 to 50:1.<br>
The combination according to the invention is suitable for all methods of application conventionally used in agriculture, e.g., pre-emergence application, and post-emergence application.<br>
In an embodiment, a tertiary combination of (1) prosulfocarb, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-soclium and metsulfuron-methyl, and (2) a tertiary combination prosulfocarb, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium and tribenuron-methyl are useful for control of undesired vegetation.<br>
The rate of application may vary within wide limits and depends on the nature of the soil, the method of application (pre- or post-emergence, etc.), the crop plant, the undesired vegetation to be controlled, the prevailing climatic conditions, and other factors governed by the method of application, the time of application and the target crop. The active ingredient mixture according to the invention can generally be applied at a rate of from 0.01 to 10, preferably 0.1 to 7, especially 1 to 5, kg per ha. In the event the compounds are applied separately, the total amount applied is the same with the individual compounds applied on the basis of the mixing mentioned above.<br><br>
Whether the combination according to the invention is used as a composition comprising compounds (A) and (B) or used as individual compounds either simultaneously or in succession, the compounds may be employed in unmodified form, /.e.f as obtained in synthesis, but are generally used in a formulation, formulated together with the adjuvants conventionally used in formulation technology, such as solvents, solid carriers or surfactants, for example, into emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules, as described in WO 97/34483, pages 9 to 13. As with the nature of the formulation, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, wetting, scattering or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The formulations can be prepared in a known manner, e.g., by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with the formulation adjuvants, e.g., solvents or solid carriers. In addition, surface-active compounds (surfactants) may also be used in the preparation of the formulations.<br>
Examples of solvents and solid carriers are given, for example, in WO 97/34485, page 6. Depending on the nature of the active ingredients to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485, pages 7 and 8. Also suitable for the preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are the surfactants conventionally employed in formulation technology, which are described, inter alia, in "McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual" MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch", Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1981 and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol l-lll, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81.<br>
The herbicidal formulations usually contain from 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of active ingredient, from 0 to 25 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant, and the balance a solid or liquid formulation adjuvant.<br>
Whereas commercial products are usually formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations. The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, e.g., vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised<br><br>
coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soybean oil), antifoams, e.g., silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers and also fertilisers or other active ingredients.<br>
Preferred formulations have especially the following compositions: (% = percent by weight)<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	1 to 90 %, preferably 5 to 20 %<br>
surfactant:	1 to 30 %, preferably 10 to 20 %<br>
liquid carrier:	balance<br>
Dusts:<br>
active ingredient mixture:      0.1 to 10 %, preferably 0.1 to 5 %<br>
solid carrier:	99.9 to 90 %, preferably 99.9 to 95 %<br>
Suspension concentrates:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	5 to 75 %, preferably 10 to 50 %<br>
water:	94 to 24 %, preferably 88 to 30 %<br>
surfactant:	balance<br>
Wettable powders:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	0.5 to 90 %, preferably 1 to 80 %<br>
surfactant:	0.5 to 20 %, preferably 1 to 15 %<br>
solid carrier:	balance<br>
Granules:<br>
active ingredient mixture:      0.1 to 30 %, preferably 0.5 to 15 %<br>
solid carrier:	99.9 to 70 %, preferably 99.5 to 85 %<br>
Examples are specific formulations include:<br><br><br><br>
Emulsions of any desired concentration can be obtained from such concentrates by dilution with water.<br><br>
The solutions are suitable for use in the form of microdrops.<br><br>
The active ingredient is mixed thoroughly with the adjuvants and the mixture is thoroughly ground in a suitable mill, affording wettable powders which can be diluted with water to give suspensions of any desired concentration.<br><br><br>
The active ingredient is dissolved in methylene chloride and applied to the carrier by spraying, and the solvent is then evaporated off in vacuo.<br><br>
The finely ground active ingredient is uniformly applied, in a mixer, to the carrier moistened with polyethylene glycol. Non-dusty coated granules are obtained in this manner.<br><br>
The active ingredient is mixed and ground with the adjuvants, and the mixture is moistened with water. The mixture is extruded and then dried in a stream of air.<br><br><br>
Ready-to-use dusts are obtained by mixing the active ingredient with the carriers and grinding the mixture in a suitable mill.<br><br>
The finely ground active ingredient is intimately mixed with the adjuvants, giving a suspension concentrate from which suspensions of any desired concentration can be obtained by dilution with water.<br>
It is often more practical for the active ingredients of the combinations according to the invention to be formulated separately and to be brought together in the desired mixing ratio in the applicator in the form of a "tank mixture" in water shortly before application.<br>
Accordingly, the composition according to the first aspect includes formulations of any nature {e.g., emulsifiable concentrate, suspension concentrates, wettable powders) and can be prepared as a specific formulation of compounds (A) and (B) or prepared from the individual formulated compounds in a container, e.g., tank mixture.<br>
The application of the compounds on the area where control is desired or the locus thereof in third and fourth aspects of the invention can be achieved by applying the compounds (A) and (B) defined in the first aspect, generally after dilution, by, for example, spray or broadcast methods.<br><br>
The time elapse between application of each compound to the area where control is desired should be such that both compounds are able to act synergistically on the undesired vegetation. The order of the compounds, in the event the application of the compounds is in succession, is not critical, although preferred is compound (A) followed by compound (B). The second compound is applied within preferably 2, more preferably 1, especially 0.5, days of the first compound.<br>
The following Examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation of the invention.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
The herbicidal action to be expected We for a given combination of two compounds (A) and<br>
(B) can be calculated according to the Colby formula (see COLBY, S.R., "Calculating<br>
synergistic and antagonistic response of compound combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-<br>
22,1967):<br>
wherein:<br>
X =   percentage herbicidal action on treatment with compound (A) at a rate of application<br>
of p kg per hectare, compared with the untreated control (= 0 %).<br>
Y =   percentage herbicidal action on treatment with compound (B) at a rate of application of q kg per hectare, compared with the untreated control.<br>
Thus, if the observed activity is greater than that the expected from the Colby formula, then synergism is present.<br>
The field tests are carried out on actual farmer fields and set up as complete randomized block with 3 replicates. All treatments are applied at early post emergence at 1-2 leaves of weeds. The products are diluted in a 300 I/ha water volume and are sprayed by air-pressured knapsack sprayer with a 2 m spray boom over the top of already emerged crops and weeds. The plots are evaluated after 5-10 days after application for crop tolerance and from 30 to 40 days for biological activity on undesired vegetation (weeds). The rating scale used is 100 % action = plant is completely dead; 0 % action = no phytotoxic action.<br><br>
Table B1: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium at 39 days after application:<br><br>
Table B2: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium at 39 days after application:<br><br><br>
Table B3: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and flupyrsulfuron-methvl-sodium at 39 days after application (39 DAA):<br><br>

Table B6: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and f lupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium at 39 days after application:<br><br>
Table B7: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and florasulam at 39 days after application:<br><br><br>
Table B8: Post-emergence herbicidal action of the composition according to the invention comprising prosulfocarb and florasulam at 36 days after application:<br><br>
The data show that the application of certain a thiocarbamate compound and a certain compound with a mode of action by inhibition of acetolactate synthase (ALS) demonstrates synergistic herbicidal activity.<br>
