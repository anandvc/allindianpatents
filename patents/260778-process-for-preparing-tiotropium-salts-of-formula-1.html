The silyl compound 5 may either be added to the mixture of dithienylglycolic acid or dithienylglycolic acid salt with coupling reagent in the above-mentioned solvent, optionally in the presence of a base such as for example pyridine, imidazole or N-alkylamine, or first of all placed together with dithienylglycolic acid or the dithienylglycolic acid salt in the above-mentioned solvent, optionally in the presence of a base such as, for example, pyridine, imidazole or N-alkylamine, and then combined with the above-mentioned coupling reagent.<br>
Preferably the three components mentioned above for forming the compound of formula 3 are added in stoichiometric amounts, but if desired the reaction may also be carried out with one of the three components present in excess (for example 1.1 to 1.5 equivalents).<br>
Preferably between 0.2 and 1.5 L, particularly preferably between 0.3 and 1 L of the specified solvent are used at this point per mol of the compound of formula 3 generated in situ.<br>
After all three components have been added, the resulting solution is mixed at the temperature indicated above for about 5 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 1 hour, particularly preferably for 20 - 40 minutes, for example by stirring, in order to form the compound of general formula 3.<br>
The compound of formula 2 is then added to the solution thus obtained. This may be done either by the addition of a solution or suspension of the compound of formula 2 in one or more of the above-mentioned solvents or by, preferably batchwise, addition of the actual compound of formula 2. If the compound of formula 2 is added after being dissolved or suspended in one or more solvents, it is convenient to use the same solvent which is used for the preparation in situ of the compound of formula 3.<br>
The amount in which the compound of formula 2 is added is determined by the amount of compound of formula 3 generated in situ. If the three components dithienylglycolic acid or dithienylglycolic acid salt, coupling reagent and compound of formula 5 are used in stoichiometric quantities to form the compound of formula 3, the compound of formulas is present in the molar amount which was selected for the three components dithienylglycolic acid or dithienylglycolic acid salt, coupling reagent and compound of formula 5. If the three components dithienylglycolic acid or dithienylglycolic acid salt, coupling reagent and compound of formula 5 are not used in stoichiometric amounts to form the compound of formulas, the compound of formula 3 is present in the molar amount of the particular one of the three starting compounds dithienylglycolic acid or dithienylglycolic acid salt, coupling reagent and compound of formula 5 which is present in the smallest quantity.<br>

After the addition of the compound of formula 3 the reaction mixture obtained is combined with a base taken up in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents according to the invention are those mentioned hereinbefore. Preferably the solvent used here is the one which is also used to form the compound of formula 3 . The bases used may be organic or inorganic bases. Organic bases used are preferably alkali metal imidazolides which may be generated in situ for example from the alkali metals and imidazole or the alkali metal hydrides and imidazole. Preferred alkali metal imidazolides include imidazolides of lithium, sodium or potassium, sodium or lithium imidazolide being preferred according to the invention. Particularly preferred are alkali metal alkoxides of sterically hindered alcohols (e.g. potassium tert.butoxide). Other preferred bases according to the invention are selected from among lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), lithium or sodium hexamethyldisilazane (LiHMDS or NaHMDS). Suitable inorganic bases preferably include hydrides of lithium, sodium or potassium. Sodium hydride is particularly preferably used as the inorganic base.<br>
0.5-2 mol, particularly preferably 1-1.5 mol, of base are preferably added per mol of the compound of formula 2 used. Within the scope of the process according to the invention, however, it is generally sufficient if only 1-1.1 mol of base are added per mol of compound of formula 2 used.<br>
To prepare the solution or suspension of base, between 0.2 and 1.5 L, particularly preferably between 0.3 and 1 L of the specified solvent are preferably used per mol of base.<br>
The base is preferably added at a temperature of -20-60°C, preferably 0-45°C, particularly preferably 0-25°C. After the addition of the base the resulting mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 3 hours, particularly preferably 45 minutes to 1.5 hours at constant temperature in order to form the compound of formula 4 .<br>
In order to liberate the compound of formula 1 from the compound of formula 4 generated in situ, a suitable acid H-X is preferably added at a temperature below 10°C, particularly preferably at about 0°C. Preferably the choice of the acid depends on the anion X" in the desired end product of general formula I. If desired, within the scope of the present invention, in addition to the acid H-X, a suitable desilylating reagent may also be added which is preferably selected from among the ammonium fluorides, particularly preferably tetrabutylammonium fluoride, tetraethylammonium fluoride, benzyltrimethylammonium<br>
fluoride, tetrahexylammonium fluoride, tetraoctylammonium fluoride or hydrogen fluoride, either free or complexed, such as e.g. pyridinium fluoride or triethylamine-HF complex.<br>
As an alternative to using one of the above-mentioned acids the compound of formula \ may also be liberated exclusively using the de-silylating reagents mentioned above .<br>
Inasmuch as compounds of general formula ]_ wherein X' denotes bromide are preferably synthesised within the scope of the present invention, the following procedure for preparing the tiotropium bromide which is preferred according to the invention is described. It is evident to the skilled man that, by a suitable choice of reagent H-X or Y-F [where Y may denote a cation such as a proton or a metal cation or ammonium, alkylammonium, tetraalkylammonium or pyridinium or a complex such as e.g. aluminium trifluoride-HF or some other fluoride donor such as e.g. diethylaminosulphur trifluoride (DAST)], a corresponding procedure can also be used analogously to prepare compounds wherein X" does not represent bromide.<br>
In order to prepare compounds of formula \_ wherein X" = bromide (= tiotropium bromide), preferably 0.2 to 20 mol, preferably 0.5 to 15 mol, particularly preferably 1 to 14 mol of hydrogen bromide, based on the compound of formula 2 used, are added at constant temperature. The hydrogen bromide used may be added either in gaseous form or in the form of preferably saturated solutions. Preferably, according to the invention, the hydrogen bromide is added after being dissolved in glacial acetic acid or water. Particularly preferably, a 33% hydrogen bromide solution in glacial acetic acid is used or particularly preferably it is used as an aqueous 62% hydrobromic acid. The acid is preferably added slowly enough that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 20°C. After the addition has ended the mixture is stirred at constant temperature, optionally also while cooling with ice (between 0.5 and 6 hours).<br>
Working up may be carried out particularly as specified in the Examples, using methods known per se. For example, the reaction mixture is combined with a protic solvent, preferably with an alcohol, particularly preferably with methanol or ethanol or isopropanol. According to the invention, preferably 0.5 to 20 L, particularly preferably 0.7 to 13L alcohol are added per mol of the compound of formula 2 used and the resulting mixture is<br>
stirred at a temperature of 0-60°C, preferably 10-45°C, particularly preferably 15-25°C for a period of about 0,5- 6 hours, preferably 0.5 - 5 hours, particularly preferably 0.5 - 4 hours.<br>
Finally, the solution obtained is combined with a more non-polar organic solvent, preferably with a solvent selected from among a ketone (such as for example acetone or methylethylketone), an alcohol (such as for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol or amylalcohol), toluene, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, methyl-tert.-butyl-ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, particularly preferably isopropanol, toluene or acetone.<br>
After thorough mixing the product that crystallises out is separated off and washed with the above-mentioned solvent. In order to separate off any water-soluble impurities, the crude product may be treated with water or aqueous bromide solutions, e.g. sodium or potassium bromide solution.<br>
A more extensive purification of the compounds of formula j[ thus obtained may be carried out, if necessary, by chromatography on silica gel or by recrystallisation from suitable solvents such as e.g. lower alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, optionally with prior treatment with activated charcoal.<br>
