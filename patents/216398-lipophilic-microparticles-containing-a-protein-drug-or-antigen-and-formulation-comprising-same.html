				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to microparticles coated with a lipophilic substance, which comprise a protein drug or an antigen, and a sustained-release formulation thereof for an effective in vivo delivery of the drug or antigen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION'<br>
It is well known that protein drugs or antigens suffer from the problem of denaturation caused by heat, organic solvents and/or unfavorable pH(Weiqi Lu et al., PDA J. Pharm. Sci. Tech., 49, 13-19 (1S95) ) . They are usually administered by injection; however, because their in vivo activities last only for a short period of time after administration, they have to be administered repeatedly when a long-term treatment is required. For example, to treat a pituitary deficient child's dwarfism, human growth hormone(hGH) must be injected daily or every other day for a period of 6 months or more. Therefore, there has been many efforts to develop effective sustained-release formulations of protein drugs or antigens.<br>
For example, extensive studies have been made to develop a sustained-release microparticle formulation prepared by coating a protein drug or an antigen with a synthetic biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactide, polyglycolide, poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly-ortho-ester or polyanhydride, which continuously releases the drug or the antigen as the polymer degrad.es in the body(M. Chasin and R. Langer, ed., Biodegradable Polymers as Drug Delivery Systems, Marcel Dekker (1990) ; and Heller, J. , Adv. Drug Del. Rev., 10, 163 (1993)). Although this type of formulation has several advantages, it suffers from the<br>
serious problem that the drug or antigen undergoes denaturation upon its contact with an organic solvent during the preparation process thereof (Park, T. G. et al. , J. Control. Rel., 33, 211-223 (1995)) . The use of an organic solvent is unavoidable because a biodegradable polymer dissolves only in an organic solvent, e.g., methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, chloroform or acetone.<br>
In order to avoid such undesirable contact of a drug or antigen with an organic solvent, Lee et al. have prepared a microparticle by coating an antigen with a water-soluble polymer to obtain a primary particle; dispersing the primary particle in an organic solvent containing a biodegradable polymer; and drying the resulting dispersion to obtain a final microparticle (Lee, H. K. et al. , J. Control. Rel. , 44, 283-294 (1997); and US Patent No. 5,753,234). However, the process of preparing such microparticle is complicated and uneconomical.<br>
There have also been attempts to develop a sustained release formulation containing a natural polymer, e.g., gelatin, collagen, chitosan, carboxymethyl cellulose, alginate or hyaluronic acid. The natural polymer easily absorbs water to form a gel having a high viscosity which releases a drug or antigen slowly. For example, US Patent No. 5,416,017 discloses a sustained-release injection formulation of erythropoietin containing a 0.01 to 3 % hyaluronic acid gel; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1-287041(1989), a sustained-release injection formulation of insulin containing a 1 % hyaluronic acid gel; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-213(1990), a sustained-release formulation of calcitonin or human growth hormone containing a 5% hyaluronic acid gel; and Meyer, J. et al. (J. Controlled Rel. , 35, 67 (1995)), a sustained release formulation of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF) containing a 0.5 to 4% hyaluronic acid gel.<br>
Such hyaluronic acid gel formulations have a sustained<br>
release effect because the protein drugs slowly pass through the gel matrix having a high viscosity. However, a gel having a hyaluronic acid concentration of several % has a high viscosity, e.g., in the order of 105 to 107 centipoise, which makes the injection thereof difficult. Further, since both the drug and hyaluronic acid dissolve in water, a hyaluronic formulation is easily diluted by the body fluid after injection, with a consequential rapid release of the drug, usually within a day. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1-287041(1989) discloses that when a 1 % hyaluronic acid gel formulation containing insulin was injected to a rabbit, the effect of lowering the blood glucose level was sustained for only 24 hours; and Meyer, J. et al. (vide supra) and US Patent No. 5,416,017, that when a 2 % hyaluronic acid gel formulation containing G-CSF and a 1.5 % hyaluronic acid gel formulation containing interference together with serum protein are administered to an animal, blood levels of these protein drugs suddenly drop to below 1/10 of the initial levels in 24 hours.<br>
Benzyl hyaluronate(HYAFF™, Fidia S.P.A.), a synthetic ester prepared by esterifying natural hyaluronic acid with benzyl alcohol, does not dissolve in water but in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO). A solid benzyl hyaluronate microparticle formulation containing a protein drug has been prepared by the emulsion-solvent extraction method(Nightlinger, N.S. et al. , Proceed. Intern. Symp. Control Rel. Bioact. Mater., 22nd, Paper No., 3205 (1995); and Hum, L. et al., J. Controlled Rel.. 29, 133 (1994)), which is conducted by dissolving benzyl hyaluronate in DMSO; dispersing the protein drug in the resulting solution; adding the resulting dispersion to mineral oil to form an emulsion; and adding a solvent which is miscible with DMSO, e.g., ethyl acetate, to the emulsion to extract DMSO therefrom to obtain solid microparticles comprising the protein drug and benzyl hyaluronate.<br>
However, the benzyl hyaluronate formulation has the<br>
drawback that the protein drug can be easily denatured by the organic solvent used in the preparative step and also by hydrophobic benzyl hyaluronate itself. An in vitro release test of a benzyl hyaluronate microparticle comprising granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor(GM-CSF) showed that only 25 % of GM-CSF was released in the initial 2 days, and, thereafter no more of GM-CSF (Nightlinger, N.S. et al. , vide supra) , suggesting that most of the protein drug was denatured.<br>
In the meantime, several attempts have been made to develop an oral formulation of a protein drug or an antigen, using, in particular, the fact that a microparticle containing an antigen having a particle size of 5 /im or less can be easily phagocytosized by a phagocyte. It, therefore, is expected that an antigen can be targeted to a specific location in the body, e.g., Payer's patches of small intestine.<br>
However, it is difficult for M cells of Payer's patches to absorb an antigen due to its hydrophilicity and high molecular weight.  To enhance the absorption of an antigen by M cells, an absorption enhancing agent such as a mixed bile  salt-fatty  acid micelle,  chelator,  fatty  acid, phospholipid,  acrylcarnitine,  surfactant,  medium chain glycerides has been employed (Lee, V. H. L., Grit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 5_, 69-97 (1988); Yoshioka, S. et al. , J. Pharm. Sci.. 71, 593-597 (1982); Scott-Moncrieff, J. C. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 83., 1465-1469 (1994); Muranishi, S. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. , 2_5, 1159-1163 (1977); Fix, J. A. et al., Am. J. Phvsiol.. 251. G332-G340 (1986) ; Shao, Z. et al., Pharm. Res., 10, 143-250 (1993); Constantinides, P. P. et al. , Proc. Int. Symp. Control. Release Bioactive Mater., 20, 184-185 (1993); andBjork, E. et al. , J. Drug Targeting, 2, 501-507 (1995)) . Further, it has been reported that when a microparticle prepared by encapsulating bovine serum albumin  in  -lecithin-cholesterol  liposome  is  orally administered to an animal, an IgA response in the glandulae<br>
salivares is increased(Genco, R. et al. , Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 409. 650-667(1983)).<br>
However, the only effective oral vaccine formulation that has been successfully developed is a polio vaccine for which an intestine receptor exists, and the liposome microparticle has the problem of structural instability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a microparticle having an improved stability and effective delivery of a protein drug or an antigen.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a sustained-release formulation comprising said microparticle.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lipophilic microparticle having an average particle size ranging from 0 .1 to 200 µ.m, comprising a lipophilic substance and an active ingredient selected from the group consisting of a protein or peptide drug and an antigen.<br>

The water-soluble excipient may be used in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 99 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 50 % by weight based on the amount of the microparticle.<br>
The lipophilic microparticle of the present invention may be prepared by coating a solid particle containing an active ingredient with a lipophilic substance according to any one of following methods.<br>
The lipophilic microparticle of the present invention may be prepared by dissolving an active ingredient in an aqueous solution containing other optional components such as hyaluronic acid and a water-soluble excipient; spray- or freeze-drying the resulting solution to obtain solid particles containing the active ingredient; dispersing the solid particles in an organic solvent containing a<br>
lipophilic substance; and then drying the dispersion to obtain solid, lipophilic microparticles. The organic solvent which may be used in the above procedure includes ethanol, methylene chloride and isopropyl alcohol.<br>
Alternatively, the lipophilic microparticle of the present invention may be prepared by dissolving an active ingredient in an aqueous solution containing other optional components such as hyaluronic acid and a water-soluble excipient, adding a surface-active lipophilic substance such as lecithin thereto to allow the surface-active lipophilic substance to hydrate, and spray drying the resulting solution. In the spray-drying step, the surface-active lipophilic substance migrates to the surface of the droplets and coats the particles containing the active ingredient.<br>
The inventive microparticle thus prepared has an average particle size ranging from 0.1 to 200 µm, preferably from 1 to 50 µm, more preferably 1 to 10 µm.<br>
The inventive microparticle containing an active ingredient has several advantages: (1) the active ingredient is not denatured and retains its full activity; (2) it releases the active ingredient fully over a prolonged time; (3) it is easily dispersed in a lipophilic medium such as an oil, and the dispersion thus obtained has a low viscosity and retains the full activity of the active ingredient; (4) it is easily fused with the phospholipid membrane of the body to effectively transport the active ingredient into the body; (5) when it is orally administered, it can be translocated into M cells of Payers's patches located in the small intestine.<br>
The microparticle of present invention may be formulated in the forms of dispersion, emulsion and aerosol.<br>
Therefore, the present invention further provides a dispersion formulation prepared by dispersing the inventive lipophilic microparticles in a lipophilic medium. The lipophilic medium which may be used in the present invention includes an edible oil, mineral oil, squalene, squalane, cod<br>
liver oil, mono-, di- or triglyceride, and a mixture thereof. Representative edible oils include corn oil, olive oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, cotton seed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil and a mixture thereof. The lipophilic medium may further comprise a dispersing agent or a preservative. The dispersion formulation may be used for injection or oral administration.<br>
The present invention also provides an oil-in-water emulsion formulation comprising an aqueous injection medium and the dispersant formulation. The aqueous injection medium includes distilled water and a buffered solution. In the emulsion formulation, the lipophilic microparticles are coated with an oil and remain in the oil phase while enhancing the formation and stabilization of the water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion formulation may be used for injection.<br>
The emulsion formulation, when its active ingredient is an antigen, may further comprise another antigen in the aqueous injection medium, thereby providing a mixed vaccine formulation. For example, a dispersion formulation which comprises microparticles of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) dispersed in an edible oil, may be mixed with a DTP vaccine containing DTP antigen adsorbed to alum in an aqueous solution, to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion formulation. The emulsion formulation thus obtained is composed of an aqueous phase containing DTP antigen adsorbed to alum and an oil phase containing solid microparticles of HBsAg. In this emulsion formulation, HBsAg and DTP antigen are present separately in the aqueous phase and oil phase, respectively, thereby preventing undesirable interactions between HBsAg and DTP antigen. In contrast, a mixed vaccine formulation prepared by adsorbing several antigens to alum in an aqueous solution is known to suffer from a low vaccination effect due to undesirable interactions between the antigens.<br>
The present invention further provides an aerosol<br>
formulation comprising the inventive microparticle. The aerosol formulation may be prepared according to a conventional method using a conventional excipient. The aerosol formulation may be administered via nasal or bronchial mucous membrane.<br>
The following Examples are intended to further illustrate the present invention without limiting its scope.<br>

Test Example 1: Stability Test of Microparticles 1 and 3<br>
To examine whether an antigen contained in a microparticle maintains its activity, each of Microparticles 1 and 3 was dissolved in water and diluted with 1,000- to 100,000-fold volume of water and the HBsAb antigenicity was examined using AUZYME kit(Abbott, USA). Results are shown in Table III.<br>
Table III<br><br>
[Table Remove]<br>
As can be seen from Table III, the antigenicity of HBsAg contained in the inventive microparticles was largely unchanged before and after the preparation. Therefore, the antigen contained in the microparticle of the present<br>
invention preserves its antigenicity.<br>
Test Example 2 : In Vitro Release Test of Microparticles 11,<br>
12 and 13<br>
Each of Microparticles 11, 12 and 13 was dispersed in a buffered solution(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 0.05 % sodium azide, pH 7.4) so that the hGH concentration was 1.0 mg/ml. An in vitro release test was conducted by stirring the resulting dispersion at 37 °C and at a preset time, the dispersion was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minute and a sample of the supernatant, taken in an amount of 1/10 volume of the dispersion, was mixed with an equal volume of the above buffered solution. hGH contained in the supernatant was quantified using Lowry method with High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC).<br>
Fig. 1 shows the release profiles of Microparticles 11, 12 and 13 thus determined. As can be seen from Fig. 1, as the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid becomes higher, and as the content of hGH decrease, the release rate of hGH becomes slower. Therefore, the protein drug release rate can be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid and the protein drug content. Further, in vitro release test results showed that an initial burst release of the protein drug does not occur and the releas'e rate is constant until 70 % of protein is released.<br>
Test Example 3: Stability test of Microparticle 12<br>
To examine whether hGH contained in Microparticle 12 maintains its activity, the procedure of Test Example 1 was repeated and the amount of hGH released from Microparticle 12 in 48 hours was determined with both reversed phase(RP) HPLC and size exclusion chromatography(SEC) . The RP HPLC was used to assess the extent of oxidative and deamidative denaturation of the protein; and SEC, the denaturation of<br><br>
the protein by aggregation.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B represent RP HPLC results for the Microparticle 12 extract solution and the hGH aqueous solution used in preparation of Microparticle 12, respectively.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B provide SEC results for the Microparticle 12 extract solution and hGH aqueous solution used in the preparation of Microparticle 12, respectively.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3, the amount of hGH released from the inventive microparticle is identical with that of the original hGH aqueous solution according to the RP HPLC results; and the SEC results show the monomeric hGH content is 95 % or more. These results suggest that hGH is not denatured during the preparation of the inventive microparticles.<br>
Test Example 4 : In Vitro Release Test of Microparticles 14<br>
to 21<br>
The procedure of Test Example 2 was repeated using each of Microparticles 14 to 21, and the cumulative amounts of the drug released in 10 and 72 hours as well as the monomeric protein content of the 72 hours sample were determined. The results are shown in Table IV.<br>
Table IV<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table IV, the microparticles of the<br>
present invention release the protein drug over a period of 3 days, with no sign of denaturation of the protein drug.<br>
Test Example 5: Injectability Test 1<br>
To examine whether the microparticles of the present invention are homogeneously dispersed in an oil dispersion or in an oil-water emulsion, injectability tests were conducted. The injectability is defined as the force required to push a syringe filled with a test sample at a velocity of 80 mm/minute. A 23 gauge injection needle was used. Samples used in these tests were an alum dispersion prepared by diluting alum with 20-fold PBS; soybean oil; the soybean oil dispersion of Example 26; the emulsion of Example 44, Comparative Dispersion 1 and Comparative Emulsion 1, and the results are shown in Table V.<br>
Table V<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table V, the dispersion of Example 26 is easily injectable, showing that Microparticle 3 of the present invention are well dispersed in oil as compared with Comparative Microparticle 1 having no lecithin coating. Particularly, since the emulsion of the present invention has a superior injectability, it can be used in preparing a mixed formulation.<br>
Test Example 6: Injectability Test 2<br>
The procedure of Test Example 5 was repeated for 0.9 % NaCl aqueous solution, cotton seed oil, the cotton seed oil dispersion of Example 30, the emulsion of Example 36, Comparative Dispersion 2, and Comparative Emulsion 2, using a 26 gauge syringe needle. Results are shown in Table VI.<br>
Table VI<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table VI, Microparticle 12 of the present invention has good dispersibility in cotton seed oil due to the lipophilic lecithin coating, and the cotton seed oil dispersion of the present invention has an injectability equivalent to that of the cotton seed oil. Further, the emulsion of Example 36 has a lower injectability than cotton seed oil in spite of the high concentration of Microparticle 12.<br>
In contrast, Comparative Microparticle 2 has an inferior dispersibility in cotton seed oil due to the absence of a lipophilic coating, causing the poor injectability of Comparative Dispersion 2. Further, when the hydrophilic surface of Comparative Microparticle 2 caused a phase separation in Comparative Emulsion 2, with a consequential leaching of the sodium hyaluronate component into the aqueous phase to raise the viscosity of water layer. Therefore, Comparative Emulsion 2 has an even poorer injectability than Comparative Dispersion 2.<br><br><br>
Test Example 7: Injectability Test 3<br>
The procedure of the Test Example 5 was repeated for the emulsions obtained in Examples 38 to 40, and soybean oil as a control. The injectability of soybean oil was 1.4 kgf, and those of the emulsions 'obtained in Examples 38 to 40 were in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 kgf similar to that of 0.9 % NaCl aqueous solution. The lipophilic surface of the microparticles of the present invention becomes coated with soybean oil, resulting in a homogeneous oil-in-water emulsion which has an injectability equivalent to that of water.<br>
Test Example 8: Injection of Formulation to Animal<br>
To examine the biological activity of the formulation of the present invention on injection, Microparticle 3 was added to soybean oil to prepare four dispersions having recombinant HBsAg loadings of 0.5, 0.125, 0.03125 and 0.0078 /µg protein/ml, respectively. As a comparative formulation, a hepatitis B vaccine(LG Chemical Ltd., Korea) containing alum as an immune adjuvant was diluted with PBS to prepare samples having HBsAg loadings of 0.5, 0.125, 0.03125, and 0.0078 fj.g protein/ml, respectively.<br>
Each dispersion sample was injected intraperitoneally to 4 weeks-old male Balb/C(H-2d) mice(10 mice) and blood samples were taken therefrom 4 months after the injection. Serums were obtained from the blood samples and titers of antibody thereof and antibody formation(%) were determined using AUSAB EIA kit (Abbott, USA) and ED50(/ig) of the microparticle was calculated using a statistical method(probit analysis). Results are shown in Table VII.<br><br>
Table VII<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table VII, the microparticle of the present invention has a smaller amount of ED5Q than the comparative formulation and higher titer of antibody than comparative formulation when the same amount of antigen is injected. Therefore, the microparticle of the present invention functions as an adjuvant for superior antibody formation.<br>
Test Example 9: Oral Administration of Formulation to Animal<br>
To examine the biological activity of the formulation of the present invention on oral administration, Microparticle 3 was added to soybean oil to prepare a dispersion having a recombinant HBsAg loading of 5 ^g protein/ml1. As a comparative formulation, a hepatitis B vaccine(LG Chemical Ltd., Korea) was diluted with PBS to obtain the same loading of 5 /µg protein/mf.<br>
Each dispersion sample was orally administered to 4 weeks-old male Balb/C(H-2d) mice(10 mice), and administered two more times, 2 and 4 weeks thereafter. Blood samples were taken from the mice after 8 weeks. Serums was obtained from the blood samples and titers of antibody and antibody formation(%) were determined using AUSAB EIA kit(Abbott, USA). Results are shown in Table VIII<br>
Table VIII<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table VIII, the mice administered with the microparticle of the present invention had 80 % antibody formation while the mice administered with the comparative formulation did not form antibody. Therefore, the microparticle of the present invention has a superior ability for forming antibody in vivo even when it is orally administered. This suggests that the microparticle of the present invention can be advantageously employed in a formulation for oral administration.<br>
Test Example 10: Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Test<br>
To examine whether the microparticle of the present invention induces a cell-mediated immune response, Microparticle 3 was added to soybean oil to obtain a dispersion having a loading of 10 /µg protein/ml . As a comparative formulation, a hepatitis B vaccine(LG Chemical Ltd., Korea) was diluted with PBS to the same loading of 10 µu protein/ml .<br>
Each dispersion formulation was subcutaneously administered to 4 weeks-old male Balb/C(H-2d) mice(10 mice), and administered two more times thereafter at 2 months intervals. Two weeks after the last administration, pre cytotoxic lymphocyte(CTL) cells were obtained from the immunized mice and cultured to obtain effector(E) cells. E cells were cultured together with target(T) cells varying the E cell to T cell ratio, and then, the number of T cells lysed by E cells(specific lysis(%)) was determined as follow.<br>
.      ,    ,	CPmsample   -    CPmnatural  release<br>
Specific Lysis(%)   =	X100<br>
P   maximum release	P   natural  release<br>
A high specific lysis value means that the cell-mediated immune response is actively induced. Results are shown in Table IX.<br>
nable IX<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table IX, the microparticle of the present invention induced the cell-mediated immune response while the comparative formulation did not.<br>
Test Example 11: Animal Test<br>
To examine the immune enhancing effect of the microparticle of the present invention, Microparticle 9 was added to soybean oil to obtain a dispersion having a SEC-SER loading of 4.0 mg protein/ml. As a comparative formulation, SEC-SER antigen was mixed with a commercial adjuvant ISA according to the manufacturer's guide, and then, diluted to the same loading of 4.0 mg protein/ml . As a control, microparticles prepared by repeating the procedure of Example 9 except that the antigen was omitted, was dispersed in soybean oil.<br>
Each dispersion formulation was intramuscularly injected to 2nd or 3rd lactating period cows(5 cows) having a large number of somatic cells and injected two more times, 2 and 4 weeks thereafter. Blood samples were taken from the cows after 2, 6, 10 and 14 weeks and then the titer of antibody was determined. Results expressed in ELISA reader are shown in Table X.<br>
Table X<br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table X, the formulation of the<br>
present invention induced the formation of a high level of antibody which lasted for 14 weeks after the first injection. Therefore, the formulation of the present invention can be advantageously employed as an animal vaccine.<br>
Test Example 12: Animal Test<br>
The effect administering of the inventive formulation containing hGH was examined using 7 weeks-old female dwarf rats(body weight: approximate lOOg) which have the heredity of low growth hormone secretion.<br>
The dispersion of Examples 30, the emulsion of Example 36, Comparative Dispersion 2, Comparative Emulsion 2, and Utroprin" (LG Chemical Ltd., Korea), an aqueous formulation were chosen for the test, and each was administered to a group of 10 dwarf rats at an hGH dose of 350 ^g per rat and then the weight gain was examined. As a control, rats which did not receive hGH were used. The average cumulative net weight gains are shown in Table XI.<br>
Table XI<br>
(unit: g)<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XI, the average weight of the rats in the Utropin® increased on the 1st day, but it decreased on the 2nd day. The weight increased thereafter at a rate similar to that of the control group.<br>
The average weight of the rats in the Comparative Dispersion 2 group continuously increased while that of the rats in the Comparative Emulsion 2 group decreased on the 3rd day. Because the microparticles in Comparative Emulsion<br><br>
2 have a hydrophilic surface, the drug dissolves, and therefore, it has an weight gain effect equal to that of the aqueous formulation, Utropin*.<br>
In contrast, the average weight of the rats administered with the dispersion of Example 30 and the emulsion of Example 36 increased for 6 days at higher rates than either Comparative Dispersion 2 or Comparative Emulsion 2. The microparticles of the present invention having lecithin coatings are covered with cotton seed oil even after injection, and absorb water only slowly, thereby releasing the drug at a constant rate.<br>
Test Example 13: Animal Test<br>
The dispersion of Example 32 and the emulsion of Examples 41 were each administered to 7 weeks-old female dwarf rats(body weight: approximate 100 g) at a bST dosage of 12.5 mg per rat and then their weight gains were examined. As a control, rats which did not receive bST were used. The average cumulative net weight gains are shown in Table XII.<br>
Table XII<br>
(unit: g)<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XII, the average weight of rats administered with either the dispersion of Example 32 or the emulsion of Example 41 increased continuously for 6 days and the rate of daily weight gain was higher than the control group. After 8 days, the weight gain became insignificant, suggesting that the drug release time is about 8 days in both case.<br>
Test Example 14: Cytopathic Effect Inhibition Test<br>
The emulsion of Example 43, Comparative Dispersion 3, interferon-a aqueous formulation were each administered to 5 months-old rabbits (body weight: 2.5 kg) at an interferon-a dosage of 300 /µg.<br>
The blood level of the drug was determined using a cytopathic effect inhibition test, which was conducted by treating cells with interferon-a, adding virus thereto and then determining inhibition of the cell pathology. Male calf kidney cell(MDBO CATCC CCF-22) and vesicular stomatitis virus (ATCC VR 158) were used in the test. Titers of interferon-a in the blood were measured for 5 days and the results are shown in Table XIII.<br>
Table XIII<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XIII, the titers of interferon-a for the rats administered with the dispersion of Example 43 were high for the entire test period of 5 days, showing higher levels of interferon-a as compared with the Comparative Dispersion 3 group from day 2. Therefore, the dispersion of the present invention has prolonged release characteristics due to the lipophilic surface of the microparticles.<br>
Comparative Test Example 1<br>
hGH was dissolved in 5mM PBS to a concentration of 2.3 mg/m£ and then sodium hyaluronate having a molecular weight<br>
of 2,000,000 was dissolved therein to a concentration of 2 %(w/v) to obtain a hyaluronic acid gel formulation.<br>
An in vitro release test was conducted using the gel formulation by repeating the procedure of Test Example 2. As a result, 100 % of hGH was released into the supernatant within 1 hour. Therefore, this gel formulation has a drug release time which is much shorter than the microparticles of the present invention.<br>
Comparative Test Example 2: Animal Test<br>
The procedure for preparing a hyaluronic acid gel formulation in Comparative Test Example 1 was repeated using 1,5 mg/m£ hGH to obtain a hyaluronic acid gel formulation having no fluidity.<br>
The gel formulation thus obtained was administered to dwarf rats at a hGH dosage of 150 /µg per rat and then the average weight gain was examined for 6 days. As a comparative formulation, an aqueous solution formulation, Utropin® was administered to rats at the same hGH dosage. As a control, rats which did not receive hGH were used. Results expressed in cumulative weight gains are shown in Table XIV.<br>
Table XIV<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XIV, the average weight gain of the rats administered with the gel formulation is similar to that of the Utropin* group. The rate of weight gain after 2 days was not significantly different among the three groups, suggesting that the drug release from the gel formulation does not lasted more than 1 day.<br><br>
Comparative Test Example 3<br>
hGH was dissolved in 5mM PBS to a concentration of 2 mg/ml and then Tween 80 was added thereto to a concentration of 0.01 wt%. The resulting solution was provided to a spray dryer (Buchi 190) at a flow rate of 3 ml/minute to obtain microparticles. In this step, the inflow air temperature was 85 °C. The average particle size of the microparticles thus prepared was 2.5 /µm.<br>
Benzyl hyaluronate was dissolved in dimethyl sulf oxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 6 % and then the microparticles were dispersed therein. The resulting dispersion was added to a mineral oil containing Aracel A™(Atlas Chemical Ind.). The mixture was homogenized to obtain a microemulsion. The microemulsion was composed of the mineral oil as a continuous phase and the benzyl hyaluronate/DMSO solution as a dispersed phase.<br>
Ethyl acetate was added to the microemulsion while stirring to extract DMSO from the dispersed phase, giving benzyl hyaluronate microparticles containing hGH. The average particle size of the microparticles was 5.5 ^tm and the content of hGH was 45 wt%.<br>
An in vitro release test was conducted using the benzyl hyaluronate formulation thus obtained by repeating the procedure of Test Example 2 and the cumulative amounts of hGH released are shown in Table XV.<br>
Table XV<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XV, the benzyl hyaluronate formulation released hGH only slightly after 5 hours and only 30 % of the loaded hGH was released in 144 hours. Thus, most of hGH in the benzyl hyaluronate formulation is bound in the benzyl hyaluronate matrix and not released.<br>
The above benzyl hyaluronate formulation was dispersed<br>
in cotton seed oil and the resulting dispersion was administered to dwarf rats at a hGH dosage of 300 /µg per rat. The average weight gain was determined and the results expressed in cumulative weight gain are shown in Table XVI.<br>
Table XVI<br><br>
[Table Removed]<br>
As can be seen from Table XVI, the benzyl hyaluronate formulation shows no significant effect after day 1.<br>
