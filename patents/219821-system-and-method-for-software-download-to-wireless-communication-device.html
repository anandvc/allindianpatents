SYSTEM AiND METHOD FOR SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD TO WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No.<br>
60/431,643 entitled "System and Method for Software Download to Wireless Communication Device" filed December 5,2002? and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I. Field<br>
[0002]	The disclosed embodiments relate generally to wireless communication systems,<br>
and more particularly to downloading software to wireless communication devices.<br>
IL Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication devices have become ubiquitous. Devices such as wireless<br>
telephones include so-called mobile station modems (MSM) that essentially are wireless communication computers which, like all digital computers, execute software to undertake the functions desired by the user.<br>
[0004]	Improvements in a wireless communication system sometimes entail changes to the<br>
software that is executed by the mobile devices in the system. For instance, changes to or additions to a system's base stations might require updated software be provided to wireless devices in the system.<br>
[0005]	Updated software can be provided to a wireless device from a computer such as a<br>
system computer operated by technical personnel by downloading the necessary software into the device through a wired or wireless path. In many devices, the incoming software is received through a wire that is connected to a personal computer (PC) having the new software. The wire terminates in a connector that mates with a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port on the wireless device.<br>
[0006]	At or near the end of a software download, many if not most MSMs execute a restart<br>
to use the new software. Among other things, a restart involves resetting processor registers and memory to default values. When a restart occurs, it appears to the downloading PC that<br><br>
the wireless device has been abruptly removed from the USB connection, despite ihe fact that the physical connection remains. While this may not be a problem from the wireless device side, it can cause problems for certain applications hosted by the PC. particuiariv the application attempting :o complete the downlead process.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	A method for downloading software to a wireless communication device includes<br>
connecting a source of software :o a universal serial bus (USB) port on the wireless communication device, and downloading die software from the source to the wireless communication device. When it is ;ime to reset ihc device, the method undertakes the reset bv executing one or more of the following: resetting registers in the orocesscr of the wireless communication device except for USB-associated registers; maintaining the device's USB transceiver in an "en" state; resetting values in the device's RAM except for USB-associated values; maintaining a USB clock source associated with the device; and setting the flash memcrv of the device in a data mode. Alternatively, all of the above actions may take place during the present reset.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect, a wireless communication device includes a processor having<br>
registers, at least some of which are USB-associated registers containing pre-reset values. The device also has a USB transceiver communicating with the USB-associated registers of the processor and with a source of software external to the wireless communication device. Logic may be executed by the processor for resetting the wireless communication device under at least one reset condition (e.g., upon completion of software download) by resetting registers other than the USB-associated registers to their default value, maintaining ore-reset values in the USB-associated registers while the non-USB-associated registers are reset, and maintaining the USB transceiver energized during the reset.<br>
[0009]	In another aspect, a system includes a source of software, a universal serial bus<br>
(USB) port connected to the source of software, and a wireless communication device supporting the USB port. The wireless communication device includes a processor and a USB transceiver interconnecting-fhe processor and the USB port. Means are provided for-resetting registers in the processor except for USB-associated registers when a warm reset condition is satisfied.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010J	The details of the disclosed embodiments, both as to their structures and operations,<br>
can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:<br>
FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the present system; and<br>
FIG. 2 shows a flow chart of the present logic.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011]	Referring initially to FIG. I. a wireless communication device is shown, generally<br>
designated 10, for facilitating computer data and/or voice communication in a radio access network. In one non-limiting implementation, the device 10 is a code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile station that may use cdma2000, cdma2000 lx, or cdma2000 IxEV-<br>
-   -       DO high data rate (HDR) principles, or other CDMA principles.   In one non-limiting embodiment, the wireless communication device 10 is a mobile telephone made by Kyocera, Samsung, or other manufacturer that uses Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) principles and CDMA over-the-air (OTA) communication air interfaces. The disclosed embodiments, however, apply to other mobile stations such as laptop computers, wireless handsets or telephones, data transceivers, or paging and position determination receivers.   The wireless communication device 10 can be hand-held or portable as in vehicle-mounted (including cars, trucks, boats, planes, trains), as desired. However, while wireless communication devices are generally viewed as being mobile, it is to be understood that the present invention can be applied to  "fixed1*  units in some implementations. Also, the disclosed embodiments apply to data modules or modems used to transfer voice and/or data information including digitized video information, and may communicate with other devices using wired or wireless links. Further, commands might be used to cause modems or modules to work in a predetermined coordinated or associated manner to transfer information over multiple communication channels.    Wireless communication devices are also sometimes referred to as user terminals, mobile stations, mobile units, subscriber units, mobile radios or radiotelephones, wireless units, or simply as "users" and "mobiles" in some communication systems.   It is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments apply equally to other types of wireless devices including without limitation GSM devices, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, etc.<br><br>
[0012!	FIG. 1 shows that the wireless communication device 10 embodies a mobile station<br>
modem (MSM) that includes a processor 12 having processor registers, including some registers 14 that are used for universal serial bus (USB) operations. The USB registers 14 are connected to a USB transceiver 16 in accordance with principles known in the art. with the USB transceiver 16 commun:rating througr. a USB port IS with a persona! eomcurer (PC) 20 that mav contain scfiware aooh rations for download to the wireless communication device 10. The PC 20 mav be connected to the USB Dort IS of the wireless communication device 10 through a wire 22 that terminates in a connector configured for engaging the USB port IS in accordance with USB principles known in the an. The wireless communication device 10 ;an also include random access memory (RA\D 24 for. e.g., storing non-program data, as well as memory such as flash memory 26 for. e.g., storing program code received from the PC 20.<br>
[0013]	FIG. 2 shows the logic of the present invention. Commencing at block2S? the logic<br>
is begun at a point in a download from the PC 20 that would otherwise require or induce a restart of the MSM, such as at completion of the download process (but perhaps-before the download application in the PC 20 has finished executing). Block 30 indicates that the following logic replaces the conventional "reset" command that would otherwise be given by the processor 12 to precipitate, which is referred to as a "cold" restart.<br>
[0014]	Moving to block 32, the processor 12 functions to reset some or all of its registers<br>
that would ordinarily be reset in a cold reset operation, except for the USB registers 14. These registers maintain whatever pre-reset, non-default values they might contain. Block 34 indicates that the USB transceiver is not deenergized during the present reset, but rather is maintained in an "on" state throughout the reset.<br>
[0015]	Moreover, at block 36 some or all RAM values that would otherwise be reset in a<br>
"cold" reset are changed to their default values, with the exception of any USB-related values. These values remain unchanged. At block 38, the flash memory 26 is not, as is done conventionally, reset, but rather is returned by the processor 12 to its data (normal) mode. In this way, during the reset discussed herein the wireless communication device 10 advantageously appears to the PC 20 to remain connected and active at the USB port 1S5 as. . indeed it remains connected physically, until such time as all PC applications no longer require or expect to detect a device at the USB port. If desired, a USB clock source associated with the device can also ce maintained.<br><br>
(0016]	While the particular SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD<br>
TO WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE as herein shown and described in detail is fully capable of attaining the above-described objects of the invention, it is to be understood that it is the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention and is thus representative of the subject matter which is broadly contemplated by the present invention, that the scope of the piesent invention fully encompasses other embodiments which may become obvious to those skilled in the art, and that the scope of the present invention is accordingly to be limited by nothing other than the appended claims, in which reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean "one and only one" unless explicitly so stated, but rather "one or more".
