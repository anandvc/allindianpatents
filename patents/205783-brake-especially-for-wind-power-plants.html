COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 1,0, rule 13)<br>
BRAKE,    ESPECIALLY  FOR  WIND  POWER PLANTS<br>
HANNING   &amp;   KAHL   GMBH   &amp;   CO.,    KG.    of   RUDOLF-DIESEL-STRASSE    6, 33 813   OERLINGHAUSEN,   GERMANY,   GERMAN  Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed   :    -<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a brake, in particular for wind power plants, comprising a set of brake shoes and an actuator for the break shoes.<br>
5	■<br>
Brakes for the rotor of a wind power plant or similar large equipment must be capa¬ble of producing a high braking force and therefore require a sufficiently strong ac¬tuator. Heretofore, a hydraulic actuator has been used which directly generates the engaging force for the brake shoes. The relatively large and heavy piston and cylinder<br>
10 unit of the hydraulic actuator is then arranged immediately behind the brake shoes. In a spacially restricted environment as for example in the engine pod of a wind power plant, It may therefore be difficult to provide sufficient space for the actuator.<br>
Hydraulic actuators have the further disadvantage that they are relatively harmful to 15 the environment, are expensive and require a high maintenance effort, because a suitable hydraulic fluid as well as seals and the like for sealing the hydraulic system are needed and because, for reasons of operational safety, the fill state of the hydrau¬lic fluid must be checked from time to time. Under these aspects, it would be desir¬able to employ an electromechanical actuator in place eff a hydraulic actuator. How-20 ever, it turns out to be difficult to provide a sufficient engaging force for the brake shoes by means of an electromechanical actuator.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a brake of the type indicated above, which permits more design freedom in terms of the construction and arrangement of the 25       nclimlnr.<br>
This object is achieved by the feature that the actuator acts upon a lever which is pivotable in a plane in parallel with the brake shoes and acts upon the brake shoes via a transmission which translates the pivotal movement into an axial movement.<br>
30<br>
Thus, in the brake according to the invention, the actuator can be arranged laterally offset from the brake shoes, which turns out to the advantages under certain instal¬lation conditions. Since, moreover, the actuator acts upon the brake shoes via the lever and via the transmission, It Is possible to substantially boost the actuating<br>
35 force by means of the leverage effect and the effect of the transmission, so that, ac¬cordingly, the actuator itself may be designed to be weaker. In particular, this makes it possible also to employ an electromechanical actuator,<br><br>
1	Advantageous details of the Invention are indicated in the depended claims.<br>
the transmission is preferably formed by a spindle which is held non-rotatably and axially displaceably in a housing and carries one of the brake shoes at one of its ends 5        and is in engagement with a threaded sleeve at the radially inner end of the lever,<br>
For reducing the actuating resistance, the threaded sleeve may be formed by a ball lining. 11. Is also possible to employ n plsmet, roller tliveniiing, n planet roller-type threaded spindle or a differential roller spindle. It Is further preferable to support the I 0 threaded sleeve In the housing by'menus of roller bearings nnd, In purlleulnr, lo sup¬port It against the actual reaction forces that are produced when the spindle is oper¬ated, by means of an axial bearing.<br>
. The brake may optionally be designed as an active brake in which the brake shoes I 5 are brought in the braking position when the actuator is energised, or as a passive brake, such as a spring accumulator brake, in which the actuator must be energised In order to retain the brake in the non-braking position, so that the" brake will auto¬matically become active, when the power of the actuator is cut off. In the latter case, the spindle must be displaced by means of the transmission and the lever in a direc-20 tion opposite to the brake shoes in order to bias the spring assembly. In a particu¬larly preferred embodiment, the transmission is so designed that it my be mounted in the housing in reverse positions, depending on the application case, so that active and passive brakes may be constructed with the use of mostly identical components, and a simple conversion from one brake type to the other is possible,<br>
Embodiment examples of the Invention will now be explained in conjunction with the drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1	is a view of a disk brake for a wind power plant;<br>
30<br>
Figure 2	is a sectional view taken along the line II - II in figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3	is a sectional view of a spring accumulator brake.<br>
35 The disk brake shown in figures 1 and 2 has a floating calliper 12 which is arranged at the rim of a brake disk 10 and is slideably guided on guide bars 14 extending in parallel with the axis of the brake disk 10, and which straddles the brake disk with<br><br>
two brake shoes 16. 18, as Is shown In Fig. 2. Mounted to the floating calliper 12 Is a housing 20 which accommodates a transmission 22, with a lever 24 projecting out of the housing, said lever being pivotable about the axis of the transmission 22 in a plane that Is parallel to the brake disk 10 and the brake shoes 16, 18.<br>
5<br>
The free end of the lever 24 Is articulated lo an actuator rod 26 of an electromechani¬cal, actuator 28. In the example shown, the actuator 28 is articulated to a support 30, that is secured to a frame of the wind power plant. As an alternative, the actua¬tor 28 might also be secured to the calliper 12 by means of a bracket 32, as is shown<br>
10      in phantom lines in Fig. 1.<br>
In the example shown, the transmission 22 is formed by a spindle 34 which carries, in its central portion, a threading 36, e. g. a ball threading, and is engagement with a threaded sleeve 38, e, g. a bull lining that Is arranged at the inner end oft.hc lever 24,<br>
lb The end portions of the spindle 34 situated on either side of the threading 36 arc slldeably guided In slide bearings 40, 42 and have keys 44 with which the spindle is secured against rotation. The threaded sleeve 38 is rotatably supported in the hous¬ing 20 by means of radial roller bearings 46. On a side facing away from the brake shoes 16, 18, it is additionally supported in the transmission housing by an axial<br>
20      bearing 48.<br>
The end of the spindle 34 shown on the left side in Fig. 1 is connected to the movable brake shoe 18. When, by means of the actuator 28, the lever 24 is pivoted about the axis of the spindle 34, the spindle 34 is displaced towards the left in Fig. 2, and the 25 brake shoes 16, 18 are evenly pressed against the brake disk. Tine reaction forces which then act upon the threaded sleeve 38 are absorbed by the axial bearing 48.<br>
In the example shown, the actuator 28 is reversible, arid the brake is disengaged by extending the actuator rod 26 by means of the actuator, so that the lever 24 is re-30       turned to the original position.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a modified embodiment of the brake which, in this case, is configured as a spring accumulator brake. A spring accumulator 50 having a spring assembly 52 is mounted to the side of the transmission housing 20 facing away from the calli-35 per 12. Here, the transmission 22 is mounted in the housing 20 in an inverted posi¬tion, so that the axial bearing 48 is disposed on the side facing the brake shoes 16, 18. The actuator, which has not been shown in Fig. 3, is energised when the brake is<br><br>
inactive, and retains the spindle 34 in a position shifted towards the right, in which<br>
position it engages the spring assembly 52 with a shifter 54 and holds it in the com¬<br>
pressed state. When the actuator 28 is switched off (or is dc-energlscd In case of<br>
power blackout), the movable brake shoe 18 Is shifted towards the right Into the<br>
!3	breaking position by the compressed spring assembly 52 and via the shifter 54 euid<br>
the spindle 34. In this case, the transmission 22 must not be self-locking, in order for the lever 24 to be pivotable by the force of the spring assembly 52 alone.<br>
In both embodiments, an additional catch or locking system may be provided for the 10      lever 24 and/or the actuator 28, so that the brake may be locked in the active or in¬active position or in both positions, even when the actuator is not energised perma¬nently.<br>
Further, is may be useful that the lever 24 is made elastic or is elastically coupled to 15       the threaded sleeve 38, e. g. by means of a overrunning spring, so that the action of the actuator is dampened and/or a reliable engagement of the locking system in the locking position is assured.<br>
