				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to mobile communications. More specifically, the invention relates to a<br>
technique for determining the performance of mobile communications terminals, such as mobile<br>
telephones.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Qualitative assessments of mobile communications network performance are essential for<br>
network operators to ensure that an offered service meets certain requirements. Such<br>
information is particularly useful in determining quality of service (QoS) in mobile<br>
communications network standards such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced<br>
Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS),<br>
etc.<br>
While statistics regarding the overall performance of a mobile data network or portions thereof<br>
provide useful performance metrics in some circumstances, the most pertinent data relates to<br>
user perceived application level performance. The analysis of application level performance can<br>
be quite complex as application level performance may be dependent on factors such as<br>
various network components and their performance (e.g., packet/signalling delays in the<br>
Serving GPRS Support Node or the Base Station Controller), radio protocol performance,<br>
transmission/application level protocols (e.g., TCP or WAP), radio conditions present within a<br>
cell, as well as the mobile equipment utilized. Performance metrics correlated to the type of<br>
mobile terminal type, such as multi-slot capability, packet processing time, software/hardware<br>
speed, protocol implementation, and radio signal processing are particularly useful as the type<br>
of mobile terminal has a significant effect on application QoS.<br>
Conventional GPRS network systems utilize an Operation and Maintenance System for<br>
passively monitoring statistical performance indicators. These indicators, which comprise<br>
counters and statistics about events in different parts of the system (such as cells, Base Station<br>
Controllers, or GPRS Support Nodes) are used for monitoring network performance and the<br>
supervision of network resources. While these statistics contain aggregated data regarding the<br>
overall performance of the network (through indicators such as network equipment<br>
performance, radio protocols, radio condition variations by geographical location, end user<br><br>
equipment performance, etc.), such data is not suitable for characterizing specific device groups<br>
(such as the performance of a specific type of mobile terminal). Furthermore, these statistics<br>
only relate to lower protocol layers (e.g., radio protocols, cell resources, TBF allocations, etc.),<br>
rather than providing metrics regarding application level performance.<br>
In some arrangements, it is possible to correlate QoS measurements to individual users on the<br>
Gi interface located between the Gateway GPRS Support Node and the external Public Data<br>
network and on the Gb interface located between the Serving GPRS Support Node and the<br>
Packet Control Unit. These correlations identify users through their International Mobile<br>
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN). While these<br>
statistics can be useful in analyzing individual usage statistics, the IMSI and MSISDN are<br>
associated with the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, which may be used in connection<br>
with multiple types of mobile terminals (and so one cannot accurately assess performance by<br>
mobile terminal type).<br>
Currently, there are some techniques that generate application performance statistics and<br>
benchmarks relating to unique mobile terminal types, but these techniques are not feasible for<br>
widespread adoption. For example, performance metrics may be generated through active<br>
measurement of mobile terminal performance (e.g., TEMS Investigation). When implemented<br>
for stationary tests, the mobile terminal remains at a fixed location, and for drive tests, the<br>
mobile terminal may be moved around during the test period. This approach is limited in that in<br>
order to get a statistically relevant amount of data, a large number of measurements must be<br>
conducted at different locations, and these measurements must be repeated for new<br>
applications and for each new mobile terminal as it becomes available. Furthermore, with this<br>
methodology, user data traffic is generated solely for the purpose of performance<br>
measurements, which often results in artificial measurements that do not accurately reflect<br>
typical mobile terminal usage.<br>
Performance statistics for benchmarking may also be generated through passive techniques by<br>
capturing user data packets in the network to reconstruct the application or session level<br>
protocol conversation for mobile terminals. For example, a device within each mobile terminal<br>
may record various transaction statistics of interest which are periodically transmitted to a<br>
central interface unit for collection and evaluation. However, it will be appreciated that such an<br><br>
arrangement would unnecessarily burden the communication network by consuming bandwidth<br>
and would require the cooperation of each mobile terminal manufacturer for implementation.<br>
It may also be possible to extract performance statistics from the Serving GPRS Support Node<br>
as it maintains the location of an individual mobile terminal in the Mobility Management context<br>
and in the Packet Data Protocol context for mobile terminals in STANDBY and READY states.<br>
While these context fields include the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) which can<br>
be used to determine the identity of the mobile terminal, such an arrangement would require<br>
significant changes in the software for the communications network and would also require each<br>
mobile terminal vendor to make certain changes to their mobile terminals.<br>
Consequently, it can be appreciated that there is a need for an improved technique for<br>
assessing the performance of mobile communications terminals on a type-by-type basis.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is embodied in a method for determining the performance of a mobile terminal<br>
within a wireless communications network. The method commences with the step of receiving<br>
messages transmitted via the communications network associated with user transactions and<br>
receiving messages transmitted via the communications network associated with mobile<br>
terminal type information. Data within the received user transaction messages are then<br>
correlated with data within the mobile type information messages. This correlation allows for the<br>
derivation of one or more performance indicators by mobile terminal type information from the<br>
correlated data. The invention may also include the step of acquiring the user transaction and<br>
mobile terminal type information messages transmitted via the communications network.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is provided in a method for determining the performance<br>
of a mobile terminal within a wireless communications network. The method includes the steps<br>
of receiving messages transmitted via the communications network associated with user<br>
transactions and receiving messages transmitted via the communications network associated<br>
with mobile terminal type information. In addition, performance indicators regarding the user<br>
transactions are derived from the received user transaction messages and those performance<br>
indicators are then correlated with data within the mobile terminal type information messages.<br><br>
The method may further include the step of acquiring the user transaction and mobile terminal<br>
type information messages transmitted via the communications network.<br>
The terminal type information may be included in the user transaction messages (or vice versa).<br>
In such a scenario the correlation step(s) may correlate data relating to terminal type information<br>
that was derived from a user transaction message with the user transaction data contained in<br>
the user transaction message.<br>
The correlation step may include a determination and an assessment of permanent or<br>
temporary identifiers included in or otherwise associated with the received messages. The<br>
identifiers may be used to identify messages that allow a correlation with one or more further<br>
messages. A determination and assessment of identifiers can be dispensed with if the terminal<br>
type information and the user transaction data are included in a single message.<br>
In some arrangements, the mobile terminal type information messages include mobility<br>
management signalling messages. Depending on the communications network and the protocol<br>
utilized, the mobility management signalling messages may include information about the type<br>
of a mobile terminal, such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity for the mobile terminal<br>
type. In some variations, the method also includes the step of adjusting the frequency of mobile<br>
messaging signals required by the communications network to increase the number of<br>
messages containing data to identify the mobile terminal type. Additionally, or alternatively, the<br>
occurrence probability of type information in the mobile messaging signals may be adjusted.<br>
Such an adjustment ensures that there will be sufficient type information transmitted over the<br>
communications network to promptly and accurately identify the mobile terminal type.<br>
In addition, messages containing user data (e.g., provided in user data packets) may also be<br>
acquired. Based at least in part on the user data (or user data packets), one or more user<br>
transactions may be reconstructed. This reconstruction may be used to identify the one or more<br>
user transactions for associating certain performance indicators thereto and for correlating<br>
mobile terminal type information therewith. As the user data will usually be generated by internal<br>
applications residing on a particular mobile terminal, the performance indicators associated<br>
therewith will permit an assessment (and benchmarking) of mobile terminal types on an <br>
application level (in contrast to, for example, a network level).<br><br>
The user transaction messages may also or alternatively include session management<br>
signalling messages. In such a case, the method may also include the step of reconstructing the<br>
user sessions from the data within the acquired messages. In other words, the performance<br>
indicators may at least partially be based on the session management signalling messages<br>
which provide certain data regarding the user sessions which may in turn be used to<br>
quantitatively and/or qualitatively assess performance related criteria associated with the user<br>
transactions (which will be, or have previously been, correlated to specific mobile terminal<br>
types).<br>
The performance indicators determined when practicing the current invention may include any<br>
criteria that may be useful in assessing or benchmarking the performance of certain types of<br>
mobile terminals within a communications network based on user transactions (and preferably<br>
on an application level). For example, the performance indicators may be dependent on<br>
processing time, radio signal decoding performance, radio signal transmission performance,<br>
multi-slot capability, application software performance, effect of protocol implementation on<br>
application level performance, throughput, number of unsuccessful transactions, number of user<br>
aborted transactions, and packet ratio loss.<br>
More specifically, the performance indicators may be based on the period of time measured<br>
from the transmission of a message and the receipt of an acknowledgment signal for the<br>
transmitted message. In other arrangements, the performance indicators may be based on<br>
messaging downlink/uplink throughput (such as for MMS - Multimedia Messaging Service<br>
messages) or IP level throughput. The performance indicators may also be based on the ratio of<br>
user aborted transactions (e.g., ratio of user aborted WAP - or MMS transactions) and/or the<br>
number of lost packets estimated from (e.g., WAP) retransmissions.<br>
Once the performance indicators have been calculated or otherwise derived for a particular type<br>
of mobile terminal, they may be used for benchmarking purposes (e.g., for benchmarking of<br>
different types of mobile terminals or against previously measured data). Accordingly,<br>
benchmarking statistics may be provided by mobile terminal type, user transaction type, user<br>
session type, geographical area, communications network, as well as any other statistical<br>
measures that may be relevant for assessing performance.<br><br>
In some variations of the invention, the method further includes the step of constructing a<br>
performance database having fields that identify the type of mobile terminal (and, if required, the<br>
type of user transaction) and corresponding fields that include calculated or estimated<br>
performance indicators. Such a performance database is useful for easy access to historical<br>
data which may be used for benchmarking purposes.<br>
The method may be implemented on a communications network that operates on an open<br>
interface to minimize the impact of the performance monitoring on the operations of the<br>
communications network as well as the mobile terminal. Depending on the communications<br>
network and protocol utilized, the open interface may include a General Packet Radio Service<br>
Interface between a Gateway General Packet Radio Service Support Node and a Packet<br>
Control Unit, a General Packet Radio Service Interface between a Gateway General Packet<br>
Radio Service Support Node and an external Public Data Network, a General Packet Radio<br>
Service Interface between General Packet Radio Service Support Nodes, an interface that links<br>
the Radio Network Controller with either a Mobile Switching Center or a General Packet Radio<br>
Service Support Node, or an interface between a core network and the UMTS Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access Network (UTRAN).<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is embodied as a computer program product comprising<br>
program code portions for performing the previously described method steps when the<br>
computer program product is run on a computer system. In some variants, the computer<br>
program product is stored on a computer readable recording medium.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a system comprising a computer processor and a memory coupled<br>
to the processor is provided. In this arrangement, the memory is encoded with one or more<br>
programs that may perform any of the previously described method steps.<br>
The invention may also be embodied in a system for accomplishing the methods described<br>
above. For example, in one variation, the invention may comprise a system for determining the<br>
performance of a mobile terminal within a wireless communications network. The system<br>
comprises a first message receiving unit for receiving messages transmitted via the<br>
communications network associated with user transactions, a second message receiving unit<br>
for receiving messages transmitted via the communications network associated with mobile<br>
terminal type information, a derivation unit for deriving, from the received user transaction<br><br>
messages, one or more performance indicators for the user transactions, and a correlation unit<br>
for correlating the performance indicators regarding the user transactions with data within the<br>
mobile terminal type information messages.<br>
In a second variation, the system, which is configured to determine the performance of a mobile<br>
terminal within a wireless communications network, may comprise a first message receiving unit<br>
for receiving messages transmitted via the communications network associated with user<br>
transactions, a second message receiving unit for receiving messages transmitted via the<br>
communications network associated with mobile terminal type information, a correlating unit for<br>
correlating data within the received user transaction messages with data within the mobile<br>
terminal type information messages, and a derivation unit for deriving one or more performance<br>
indicators by mobile terminal type information from the correlated data.<br>
One system or both systems may optionally further include one or more acquisition units for<br>
acquiring either one or both of the user transaction messages and mobile terminal type<br>
information messages transmitted via the communications network. The one or more acquisition<br>
units may be co-located with or remote from the remaining system units.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are<br>
set forth, such as particular sequences of steps and various configurations, etc. in order to<br>
provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these<br>
specific details. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions explained<br>
herein below may be implemented using software functioning in conjunction with a programmed<br>
microprocessor or general purpose computer, and/or using an application specific integrated<br>
circuit (ASIC). It will also be appreciated that while the current invention is primarily described as<br>
a method, it may also be embodied in a computer program product as well as a system<br>
comprising a computer processor and a memory coupled to the processor, where the memory is<br>
encoded with one or more programs that may perform the methods disclosed herein.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a process flow diagram 100 according to a first embodiment of the invention.<br>
The flow diagram relates to a passive monitoring technique for determining the performance of<br>
a mobile terminal, where, at step 110, messages are received that contain data regarding one<br>
or more user transactions. At step 120, messages are received containing data'having mobile<br>
terminal type information. Once the user transaction messages and mobile terminal type<br>
information messages are received, the data pertaining to user transactions are correlated with<br>
the data pertaining to mobile terminal type information at step 130. Once the correlation has<br>
been completed, performance indicators may be calculated by mobile terminal type information<br>
from the correlated data correlated at step 140. Although not shown, the method may also<br>
include the step or steps of sampling user transactions messages and mobile terminal type<br>
information messages from a communications network (such as a wireless mobile<br>
telecommunications network).<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the above steps may be modified such<br>
that the method derives, at step 140, from the received messages performance indicators<br>
regarding the one or more user transactions and then subsequently correlates the performance<br>
indicators regarding the one or more user transactions with the mobile terminal type information.<br>
Further details regarding this process are described below.<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a schematic process flow diagram 200 relating to the acquisition of source data<br>
for determining various performance indicators for each mobile type. The schematic diagram<br>
relates to the acquisition of data within messages acquired from an open interface of the<br>
communications network that generally relate to three categories, namely user data 210,<br>
session management signalling 220, and mobility management signalling 230.<br>
The user transaction messages containing user data 210 are typically acquired (or sampled)<br>
between the core network and the radio network, and/or between the core network and external<br>
networks. The preferred point to acquire or sample user data messages is dependent upon the<br>
number of measurement points, the identifiers available within the messages so that the<br>
messages may be correlated with user transactions, as well as security measures employed in<br>
the communication network.<br>
The user transaction messages containing session management signalling 220 (e.g., messages<br>
such as Create PDP Session, Delete PDP Session, etc.) define the user packet sessions.<br>
These messages may be acquired or accessed on two or more interfaces such as the Gb<br>
interface (located between the Serving GPRS Support Node and the Packet Control Unit), Gn<br>
interface (located between the GPRS Support Nodes), and Radius interface (i.e., the Remote<br>
Authentication Dial-In User Service that secures remote access to networks and network<br>
services against unauthorized access) in a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) / Enhanced<br>
Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) network.<br>
The mobile terminal type information messages containing mobility management signalling 230<br>
relate to mobility functions provided by a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) such as a Global<br>
System for Mobile communication (GSM) network or Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System (UMTS) network. The mobility management signalling messages track a mobile<br>
terminal as it moves throughout the network to ensure that communication is maintained. The<br>
mobility management signalling messages 230 may contain an identifier to uniquely identify<br>
each mobile terminal such as an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).<br>
The IMEI is typically a fifteen digit number that includes a Type Approval Code (TAC) of six<br>
digits that is used to identify the mobile terminal equipment manufacturer and the terminal type,<br>
a Final Assembly Code (FAC) of two digits that identifies where the mobile terminal was<br><br>
manufactured, a Serial Number (SNR) of six digits that with the TAC and FAC uniquely<br>
identifies the mobile terminal, and a spare digit. In some networks, mobility management<br>
signalling messages 230 may contain an International Mobile Equipment Identity and Software<br>
Version (IMEISV) which is a sixteen digit identifier that includes the TAC, FAC, SNR, as well as<br>
a two digit identifier relating to the software version of the mobile terminal.<br>
In most communication networks, the frequency of mobility management signalling messages is<br>
not standardized (and is SGSN implementation dependent). However, some network nodes<br>
may be configured to permit the IMEI check to be switched on and off and to change the<br>
frequency of the IMEI check, as the mobile terminal sends its IMEI whenever requested. With<br>
such a configuration, with the participation of the communications network operator, the IMEI<br>
check may be maintained either in a constant "on" polarity or at a fixed or variable frequency<br>
during performance indicator measurements.<br>
 The messages containing user data 210 are reconstructed in step 215 to determine what type of<br>
 user transactions the mobile terminal was processing. Acquired messages containing IP<br>
packets are processed one by one and the packets belonging to the same application<br>
transaction of the same user are grouped together. These groups can be created by examining<br>
fields in the IP header such as the source IP address, destination IP address, source port, and<br>
destination port. Applications can be identified by port number (e.g., TCP port 80 is used for<br>
web traffic). Depending on the application logic, identified packet groups can be further divided<br>
into user transactions such as TCP connections, HTTP object downloads, WAP object<br>
downloads, and the like. After the all of the packets for a particular transaction are collected,<br>
condensed information (e.g., start, end, duration, amount of data in uplink and downlink,<br>
success, failure of the transaction, etc.) may be generated. )<br>
In step 225 the messages containing data pertaining to session management signalling 220 are<br>
reconstructed to determine the underlying session information which will subsequently be used<br>
to assess the performance of a mobile terminal. During session management signalling, a<br>
subscriber is identified by one of its unique identifiers in the mobile system (for example, its<br>
International Mobile Subscriber Identify) and the system responds with an IP address, which the<br>
mobile terminal can use for its application transaction. By parsing through these signalling<br>
messages, the required association between subscribers and their data sessions and<br>
application transaction can be established. Summary data (type and number of transactions,<br><br>
total number of uplink and downlink traffic, Quality of Service profile) is generated for<br>
transactions belonging into the same user session. The messages containing mobility<br>
management signalling 230 are used to determine the mobile terminal type in step 2351<br>
The user transactions, sessions, and mobile types are then correlated by mobile terminal type in<br>
step 240. The correlation may be based on identifiers associated with the acquired messages.<br>
Such identifiers include for example a telephone number, a port number, and the like.<br>
Information regarding the various user transactions is stored within a transaction database 250<br>
and information regarding the various user sessions is stored within a session database 260.<br>
From these two sources, the performance indicators may be calculated in step 270 (e.g., by<br>
mobile terminal type) and subsequently stored for access and review within a performance<br>
database 280. The performance indicators may be derived by accessing transaction records<br>
within the transaction database 250 associated with a desired key performance indicator for<br>
each type of desired mobile terminal type. For example, if the key performance indicator relates<br>
to user transaction time, the timestamp of a first data packet and a time stamp of the last data<br>
packet for a particular transaction may be accessed from the transaction records for each type<br>
of mobile terminal. Multiple measurements from the same type of mobile terminal may be<br>
averaged to provide a single performance indicator for each mobile terminal type.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the transaction database 250, the session<br>
database 260 may be combined with the performance database 280 depending on design<br>
preferences. As separate databases, the transaction database 250 provides useful information<br>
regarding the performance of the applications and the session database 260 provides<br>
information such as characteristics of PDP sessions within a particular GPRS network.<br>
The amount of delay, throughput, unsuccessful transactions, and packet loss are typically the<br>
measures most useful in determining quality of service. Delay may be calculated based on a<br>
variety of measurements. For example, delay may be calculated based on the round trip time of<br>
a Wireless Transmission Protocol (WTP) data packet or a Multimedia Messaging Service<br>
(MMS) data packet based on the time measured from the WTP Result and WTP ACK as<br>
calculated for small packets (less than 200 bytes) and large packets (between 900 and 1100<br>
bytes). Delay may also be calculated based on a group of packets, such as the transmission<br>
and acknowledgment time for a group of four packets.<br><br>
Throughput may be a measure of downlink/uplink throughput (such as based on MMS or SMS<br>
messages) or it may be based on the IP level throughput during a bandwidth demanding TCP<br>
connection (during HTTP GET/PUT or FTP RETR/PUT) (for example, please see "A Large-<br>
scale, Passive Analysis of End-to-End TCP Performance over GPRS" Peter Benko, Gabor<br>
Malicsko, Andras Veres, IEEE Infocom, Hong Kong, March 2004, herewith incorporated by<br>
reference). The number of unsuccessful transactions may be based on the ratio of user aborted<br>
WAP or MMS transactions and the packet loss may comprise the ratio of loss packets estimated<br>
from WAP retransmissions.    <br>
With regard to Fig. 3, a schematic flow diagram 300 is provided that illustrates that in some<br>
variations, a performance database 380 includes an identifier field 370 and a performance field<br>
380. The performance database 380 is built by assigning each captured packet to its mobile<br>
terminal type, user transaction (such as a web object download or sending an MMS message<br>
and session. The identifier field 370 is populated with data pertaining, for example, to the user<br>
or protocol utilized as extracted from acquired messages. The identifier field 370 might contain<br>
information such as phone number 305, the particular application that was utilized for the user<br>
transaction 310, the IP address of the mobile terminal 315, the International Mobile Subscriber<br>
Identity (IMSI) 320 (and/or the mobile terminal type), the port number 325 for the Service<br>
Access Point where transport protocols pass information to higher layers, and the protocol type<br>
330 utilized. The performance field might contain performance information correlating to the<br>
identified mobile terminal type (and related identifying information) such as packet delay 335<br>
(based on the amount of time from the transmission of a packet to the receipt of a<br>
corresponding acknowledgment), packet loss 340 (estimated from retransmissions), failed<br>
transactions 345, and overall throughput 350.<br>
For GPRS and E-GPRS networks, mobile terminal identifiers (e.g., IMEI/IMEISV) are contained<br>
within messages communicated between the mobile terminal and the Serving GPRS Support<br>
Node (SGSN) in the GPRS Mobility Management (GMM) Protocol. These protocol messages<br>
are available on the Gb interface (which is located between the SGSN and the Packet Control<br>
Unit) and may be acquired or captured during an Authentication Procedure (that is typically part<br>
of the GPRS Attach Procedure) or Identity Check Procedure.        <br><br>
The SGSN may require the IMEI/IMEISV from the mobile terminal in GMM messages such as<br>
AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST or IDENTITY REQUEST. The Authentication<br>
and Ciphering Request contains the IMEISV request information element (IE). If the information<br>
element indicated that IMEISV is requested, the mobile terminal must provide it in the<br>
corresponding Authentication and Ciphering Response message, and this message is acquired<br>
to determine mobile terminal type. In addition, the GMM Identity Request message contains an<br>
identifier type information element to specify which identifier type is requested. It can be the<br>
IMSI, IMEI, IMEISV or Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI).<br>
An SGSN may initiate the Authentication or the Identity Check procedures during a GPRS<br>
attach as well as in certain cases while the mobile terminal is attached. While IMEI check is not<br>
included in all attach procedures, it is not always necessary to determine the IMEI for all user<br>
data traffic. In addition, even if the Gb interface is encrypted, the GMM Attach Request,<br>
Authentication Request / Response, and Identity Request / Response messages will still be<br>
available as they are not ciphered.<br>
The current invention may be configured to analyze a wide variety of key performance indicators<br>
that may be useful to network operators as well as mobile terminal manufacturers and<br>
application developers. Of particular interest are those properties which may be uniquely<br>
attributed to the type of mobile terminal utilized such as radio signal decoding / transmission<br>
performance, packet processing speed (in hardware), multi-slot capability, application software<br>
performance (WAP, MMS, etc.), and effect of protocol implementation on application level<br>
performance.  <br>
With regard to Fig. 4, a sample methodology for determining the IMEI is illustrated as a process<br>
flow diagram 400. With this arrangement, the Base Station System GPRS Protocol (BSSGP)<br>
UL/DL UNITDATA packets, at step 410, are sampled from the Gb interface. The BSSGP is a<br>
protocol layer between the SGSN and the Base Station System (BSS), which is the layer that is<br>
also used by GMM protocol messages. A BSSGP UNITDATA Protocol Data Unit (PDU) header<br>
includes a Temporary Logic Link Identifier (TLLI), while the downlink packets include the IMSI.<br>
The TLLI is used for addressing GPRS users between the SGSN and the BSS. The logical link<br>
between the mobile terminal and the SGSN is uniquely identified by the TLLI. While the SGSN<br><br>
may alter the TLLI value, the BSSGP header continues to contain the previous TLLI information<br>
element.<br>
From GMM protocol messages, at step 420, the IMEI may be determined or decoded along with<br>
the relevant TLLI. The IMEI and TLLI information is then used, along with timestamp<br>
information, TLLI information and IMSI information, to trace TLLI and, at step 430, assign the<br>
IMEI identifiers to their appropriate IMSI and provide them with a time interval in which this<br>
assignment is valid. The output of this process is either directly used for online correlation with a<br>
Performance Database, at step 450, or stored in a Terminal Type Database, at step 440, for off<br>
line processing.<br>
At step 430, the IMEI is assigned to one or more user transactions via IMSI. In order to utilize<br>
IMSI as a user transaction identifier, the user data may be captured, sampled, or otherwise<br>
acquired in one of three manners depending on the availability of certain GPRS interfaces and<br>
network configurations.<br>
First, if the Gb interface is not encrypted or it is possible to decipher the messages (by using Gr<br>
interface messages), then user data and session management packets can be captured on the<br>
Gb interface as Logical Link Control / Sub Network Dependence Convergence Protocol<br>
(LLC/SNDCP) PDUs. The BSSGP protocol header includes the IMSI information element in<br>
every downlink packet.<br>
Second, the user data and session management packets may be captured on the Gn interface<br>
(which is located between the GPRS Support Nodes). With GPRS Tunnelling Protocol version 0<br>
(GTPvO), IMSI is included every packet as part of the tunnel ID. With regard to GTPvl, the<br>
Create PDP Context Request includes the IMSI, while user packets of the PDP context are<br>
identified by the tunnel.<br>
Third, data packets may be captured on the Gi interface (which is located between the Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node and the external Public Data Network). Session management information<br>
may be obtained from the messages to and from the Remote Authentication Dial-In User<br>
Service (RADIUS) server. When the PDP context is activated, the MSISDN for the mobile<br>
terminal is sent to the RADIUS server. In some variations, the IMSI may also be included with<br><br>
the MSISDN. However, if the IMSI is not available from the acquired messages, a list of IMSI-<br>
MSISDN pairs is used to correlate IMSI with MSISDN.<br>
The current invention may also be implemented in a Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System (UMTS) as the two GMM Messages, namely Authentication and Ciphering Response<br>
and Identity Response, each may include the IMEI/IMEISV identifiers. The aspects of this<br>
embodiment are similar to those described above, except that a different interface is utilized<br>
between the core network and the radio network.<br>
With a UMTS arrangement, the lu interface between the core network and the UMTS Terrestrial<br>
Radio Access Network (UTRAN) is the preferred point at which to monitor the GMM Messages.<br>
The user plane uses GTP-U protocol to carry user data packets and signalling messages. The<br>
GMM messages can be acquired in the control plane, where the radio network layer is Radio<br>
Access Network Application Part (RANAP), using Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP)<br>
services from the transport network layer.<br>
The RANAP uses one signalling connection per active User Equipment (which is a combination<br>
of the mobile terminal and the SIM card) and core network for the transfer of layer (3) three<br>
messages. Captured packets on this interface contain the lu signalling connection identifier<br>
which can be used for connecting the mobile station IMSI obtained from GMM Attach messages<br>
to the IMEI gained from other GMM messages. This tracing procedure can either result in the<br>
same Terminal Type Database as in the case of GPRS, or used for on-online correlation with<br>
the Performance Database.<br>
FIG. 5 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a system 500 for practicing the present<br>
invention. The system 500 may be arranged on the side of a network node and comprises a first<br>
message receiving unit 520, a derivation unit 530, a second message receiving unit 540 and a<br>
correlation unit 550, configured to implement a method for determining mobile terminal<br>
performance, such as that described in connection with Fig. 1. In some variations, the first<br>
message receiving unit 520, the derivation unit 530, the second message receiving unit 540,<br>
and the correlation unit 550 are coupled together, although it will be appreciated that it may not<br>
be necessary to interconnect each of the units and that certain units may be combined<br>
depending on design preferences.<br><br>
The first message receiving unit 520 receives messages transmitted via a communications<br>
network 510 regarding one or more user transactions. The second message receiving unit 540<br>
received messages transmitted via the communications network 510 regarding mobile terminal<br>
type information. The correlation unit 550 correlates data within the user transactions messages<br>
associated with data within the mobile terminal type information messages. The derivation unit<br>
530 then analyzes the correlated data to generate one or more performance indicators of<br>
interest (e.g., delay, throughput, transaction success ratios, packet loss, etc.) by mobile terminal<br>
type information.<br>
The derived performance indicators may then be used for a variety of analysis techniques as<br>
desired by the monitoring entity. Furthermore, the skilled artisan will also appreciate that, in the<br>
alternative, the derivation unit 530 may be configured to derive one or more performance<br>
indicators for the one or more user transactions, and the correlation unit 550 may be configured<br>
to correlate the performance indicators regarding the one or more user transactions with the<br>
mobile terminal type information. In addition, it will also be appreciated that the system may also<br>
include one or more acquisition units for acquiring the messages transmitted via the<br>
communications network and for providing the acquired messages to the first and second<br>
message receiving units 520, 540.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that there are many advantages to identifying the various<br>
effects that different types of mobile terminals have on application level performance in<br>
accordance with the invention. Such information is useful for equipment manufacturers to obtain<br>
feedback on the performance of their mobile terminals in "real world" everyday uses, the<br>
communication network operators to determine the performance of mobile terminals for various<br>
GPRS application, and vendors to more specifically identify the causes of performance<br>
degradation and to help separate network and mobile terminal performance issues.<br>
Importantly, the invention provides a solution for (quantitatively) analyzing and benchmarking<br>
different mobile terminal types in an inexpensive passive fashion. As standardized network<br>
interfaces may be used, the methodology is vendor independent. In addition, the invention may<br>
be implemented over a wide geographic area from only one monitoring point (such as a GPRS<br>
Base Station Controller area which typically covers 100-200 cells) to provide statistical data on a<br>
geographical basis.<br><br>
While the present invention has been described with respect to particular embodiments<br>
(including certain system arrangements and certain orders of steps within various methods),<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is not limited to the specific<br>
embodiments described and illustrated herein. Therefore, while the present invention has been<br>
