				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention pertains to a method for production of<br>
porous gas diffusing electrodes of the class (sort) indicat-<br>
ed in the patent claim no. 1. Such a gas diffusing electrode<br>
can base on , for example , a catalytic-active silver or<br>
silver alloys for the application in electro-chemical cells ,<br>
especially of the chlorine (gas) - alkali - electrolysis or<br>
on alkaline fuel cells.<br>
In electrochemical cells the reduction of oxygen is imple-<br>
mented at platinum, silver or also carbon. Platinum is appli-<br>
cable both in acidic as well as in alkaline surrounding ,<br>
whereas silver and carbon are corrosion resistant only in ..<br>
alkalic electrolytes. However, in case of the silver catalyt-<br>
ic agent also in alkaline media a rash deactivisation occurs,<br>
which is explained by rearrangement of the oxldic surface of<br>
the silver. ( Texas Instruments, U.S. 35 05 120 ). It has<br>
been attempted on several occassions , to reduce the corro-<br>
sive attack of the silver by suitable alloy partners. There<br><br>
both alloys with precious materials like platinum, palladium gold and<br>
mercury ( quick silver) ( DE 20 21 009 ) , but also with non<br>
-precious materials (metals) , like nickel (DE 15 46 728), ,<br>
copper and other metals are known. It has also been attempted<br>
to achieve a stabilisation of the silver both by purification<br>
as well by anodic corrossion -protection (local element),<br>
In case of the corrosion, there builds at first a silver-<br>
oxide-surface Since silver oxide is relatively good solu-<br>
ble in alloys , with that a rearrangement of the silver cr-<br>
ystals can take place. In the print 2 and 3 REM inclusion of<br>
stiver electrodes before and after the operation are represen<br>
-ted. It is possible to recognise very distinctly the shrink-<br>
age of the inner porous structure. The catalytic activities<br>
goes down.<br>
Besides the stabilisation the method for production of an<br>
active silver catalytic agent (catalyser) must also ensure,<br>
that the active surface of the silver is adequately large,<br>
that means, the grain size of the silver is as far as possi-<br>
ble small. Thus, for example, is known from the booklet (US<br>
3 668 101), that the very active silver catalysers are<br>
achieved in case of particle diameter of 5 to 10 µm size.<br>
Further more methods are known, in case of which it is attem-<br>
pted, to produce smallest particles of stable silver alloys.<br>
Adequately small silver particles are generated during proced-<br>
ures, of precipitation. Besides the control of p-H value, of<br>
the temperature and of the supersaturation, there plays so<br>
called crystallsing embryo an extraordinary role, in order<br>
to produce smallest silver particles. Known is also a method<br>
(EP 0 115 8^5)t in case of which a mixture from silver nltr -<br>
ate and quick silver (mercury) nitrate is deposited on a<br>
PTFE dispersion by addition of potassium hydroxide. Herewith<br>
a silver amalgam is produced with smallest particle diameter .<br>
In order to produce so called gas diffussion electrode from<br>
this catalytic agents, as these are required in fuel cells<br>
or in the chloride -alkali-electrolysis, the powder must be<br>
processed for a homogeneous and laminar electrode. This elec-<br>
trode must be electrically conductive and must render possi-<br>
ble both the entrance of the electrolyte as well as also<br>
gas. Even the spheres of the electrode must be in a position<br><br>
to be moistened,whereas other spheres of moistening must be<br>
protected. A solution of this problem was represented with<br>
a bi-porous poring structure. The electrolyte can at first<br>
penetrate without any trouble both in the small as well as<br>
in the large pores. By en excess pressure of the gas or the<br><br>
gravitational force the electrolyte is distanced again from the<br>
larger pores.Such biporous structures operate only then satis-<br>
factorily, when a difference of pressure between the gas cha-<br>
amber and the electrolyte room can prevail. Whether such di-<br>
fference of pressure can build automatically, when in the<br>
electrolyte a membrane separates the anode and cathode from<br>
one another, is questionable. Thereby, it is not possible that<br>
these electrodes be related to the chlorlde-alkaline-electr-<br>
lysis or in fuel cells with alkalic membrane.<br>
Therefore it was attempted to construct on the material pro-<br>
perties a bi-porous poring system. That means , one requires<br>
hydrophile and hydrophob materials. Suitable hydrophobmate-<br>
terials are some thermoplasts- asfor example , Polytetrafl-<br>
uorethylene. The mentioned catalytic agents and also the<br>
silver are always hydrophyl. If one mixes silver and PTFE<br>
together and forms therefrom a plane electrode, then this<br>
displays different spheres with hydrophil and hydrophob pro-<br>
perties. Mostly an additional metalic conductor is integrat _<br>
ed, in order to achieve better electrical properties.<br>
Some methods are known, to produce mixtures from PTFE (Poly-<br>
tetrafluorethylene) and catalytic agent a so called gas di-<br>
ffussion electrode. Thus it is proposed, for example , in<br>
the write-up (EP 0 115 845) to float (suspend) on the mate-<br>
rials in the manner that one gets a paste, which in form <br>
can be poured, passed and dried up. Disadvantageous in case<br>
of such " pasted " electrodes is the homogeneous division<br>
of the material - It can easily result in small holes ,<br>
through which gas or electrolyte can penetrate. In order<br>
to prevent this, the electrodes are produced at least 0.8 mm<br>
thick. As a result, there prevails a very high quantity of<br>
silver in the electrode (around 2 kg/m2), so that the ad-<br>
vantage in respect of the silver is again gone lost. Since<br>
these commercial oxygen electrodes with around 4-40 g/m2<br>
Platinum/Carbon are known.<br>
Two methods are known, in case of which out of such hydroph-<br>
obes/ hydrophlle materials a thin , homogeneous gas dlffu-<br>
ssion electrode is rolled. According to the method (EP-0 144<br>
002, US 4 696 872) in one special mixer the catalytic parti-<br>
cles and the PTFE are mixed with one another in such a manner,<br>
that a finely mixing hydrophobe network system condenses on<br>
the Catalysator. In a powder roller the loosely poured subs-<br>
stance is rolled together to a folio of around 0.2mm. thick.<br>
This method has proved Itself worthwhile for mixer of PTFE<br>
and Carbon, or PTFE and Raney-Nickel. It is similarly possi-<br>
ble, thereby as a result, to roll (rough) down a Ranny-Sil-<br>
ver- Alloy with 80% Allumlnium for a porous foil. Such s<br>
calender rolling mill is represented in the print no. 1.<br>
However, it is not possible to process the ductile Silver.<br>
In case of the necessary surface (contact)-pressure-around,<br>
0.01 to 0.6 t/cm2 in such powder rollers PTFE and Silver are<br>
pressed to a compact, gas and electrolyte impermeable foil.<br>
The cirrent-voltage-characteristic line of such an electrode<br>
has to be seen in Print no.5.<br>
In order to be able to produce Silver electrodes, at first<br>
a Silver Oxide/ PTFE mixture is processes in the pulverising<br>
roller and subsequently reduced Electro-chemlcally/ (DE 37 10<br>
168). The Silver oxide is stable enough, in order to resist<br>
the surface pressure of the roller. Besides that, the volume<br>
reduces itself during transition from Silver oxide to the Silver,<br>
so that additional pores develop in thegas diffussion electrode.<br>
By the parameter during reduction the grainsire of the particle<br>
can very well be adjusted. Disadvantageous in case of this<br>
method is that it is not yet known, how Siver Alloys with cata-<br>
lytic properties can be reduced electrochemlcally. Thereby it<br>
is also not possible to produce long time stable Silver elec-<br>
trodes by the electrochemical reduction.<br>
The task of the present invention exists therein , to make<br>
readily available a method of production of a gas diffusion<br>
electrode, with which not only the disadvantages of the state<br>
of art technique is avoided, but also specially reproducible<br>
results during methodical production adjusts itself.<br>
With a method of the nature Indicated in the beglning this prob<br>
lem is solved in accordance with the invention thereby , that<br>
the<br>
-the porous system of the Silver catalytic agent is<br>
filled up with a moistening liquidity,<br>
- a dimension stable rigid body is mixed with a grain<br>
size above that of the Silver catalytic agent below<br>
the silver catalytic agent<br>
- this consequent compression-stable substance is formed<br>
but in a calender homogeneous to a catalytic agent<br>
band and<br>
- ina «econd calender step an electrically conductive<br>
arresting material is pressed-in in the catalytic<br>
agent band<br>
The speciality of the method in accordance with the invention<br>
lies therein, that inner porous system of the ductile mate-<br>
rials has to be filled up with a liquidity. Since this liqui-<br>
dity cannot be condensed and on the other hand is connected<br>
through the capillar forces rigidly in the poring system, it<br>
ls possible also in case of the present pressure of maximum<br>
i<br><br>
600 kg/ cm2 to distance the liquidity from the micro pores.<br>
A further mixture of some Carbon powder or of the volatile<br>
ammonium carbonate can furthermore receive (hold) the mecha-<br>
nical pressure of the powder rolls. By means of these coarse<br>
grainedjadditions of typical 10 - 100 µm grain diameter the<br>
pouring system with larger pore diameter is protected from<br>
the condensation. By means of a subsequent temperature pace<br>
it is possible that both the liquidity as well as the solid<br>
matter ammonium carbonate are operated from the electrode.<br>
In this manner it is possible to receive large pores in the<br>
gas diffusion electrode,which take care of the quick transport<br>
of gas and smaller pores in a catalytic agent which permits<br>
a homogeneous utlllisation of the catalysator ( catalytic agent).<br>
A prefered implementation of this method is represented as<br>
follows : at first Silver or a Silver alloy is produced by<br>
a precipitation process. There it is advantageous,to imple-<br>
ment the precipitation on a PTPE dispersion. The best expe-<br>
riences are made with a mixture of 15% Teflon and 85% Silver.<br>
With the help of addition of formaldehyde during precipitation<br>
there converts itself in the alkalic surrounding the Silver<br>
hydroxide immediately in a Silver crystal. The precipitation<br>
substance is washed and dried up. A subsequent temperature<br>
at 200 C improves the electrical contact between the Silver<br>
particles and drives the residual liquidities out.<br>
To this powder a volume of around 5% - 40 %t preferably <br>
however 8 %% of a liquidity is given, which can penetrate<br>
in the poring system of the PTPE and of the Silver. Because<br>
of the hydrophobe character of the PTPE there come thereto<br>
only Isopropanol Ethanol and Methanol in question. If the<br>
powder is moistened and filled up with such solution agent,<br>
then an exchange of liquidities can be connected at this .<br>
If one brings, for example, a powder impregnated in Iso-<br>
propanol in a water bath, or Glycerine, then there exchange<br>
within hours the liquidities by diffussion. In this manner<br>
there arrives a liquidity in the poring system of the PTFE,<br>
which is usually knocked off (planned off) by the PTFE.<br>
This thus moistened ( dampened) material behaves ltsdlf taa<br>
in this manner outwards as a powder, since the liquidity<br>
prevails only in the inner poring system.<br>
Another class of the moistening medium are the so called<br>
tenside. These penetrate both in the poring system, cover<br>
also the surface of the catalytic agent and reduce thus its<br>
surface roughness. This small surface roughness leads in<br>
the rolling process thereto, that the Silver Catalytic<br>
agent can deviate from the compression *one, whereas other<br>
powder components, which have not been treated, remain in<br>
the compression tone and thus then generate the electrode<br>
connection level, in which the Silver Catalytic agent is<br>
embedded (print 4). As such a powder there proffer (offer)<br>
Ammonium carbonate or active coal, which is now mixed with<br>
the Silver Catalytic agent in a crusher to a homogeneous<br>
substance, as it is described in EP 0 144 002. Subsequently<br>
the loose vibrated (shaken) substance is cogged (rolled out)<br>
with the help of powder roll to approximately 0.2 mm thick<br>
foil.<br>
In a second pair of rolls a metallic supporting frame in<br>
the form of a woven network or expanded metal can be rolled<br>
in, and thereby the mechanical stability and the electri-<br>
cal conductivity can improve. According to this procedure<br>
the gas diffussion electrode is dried up. According to that<br>
the electrode has a silver coating between 0.2 kg/m2 and 1.5<br>
kg/m2. Conventionally a weight of around 0.5 kg/m2 is attem-<br>
pted . Therewith upto 75% of the uptil now necessary silver<br>
can be saved (spared). Despite the reduced silver weight<br>
there follows with such electrodes current-voltage-charac-<br>
teristic line as are to be seen from the print no.6.<br>
This method may be obviously combined also with other methods.<br>
Thus it is possible to ignore the environmentally harmful<br>
formaldehyde during the precipitation and for this purpose<br>
the reduction after the production of GDE can be completed<br>
in electrochemical way. It may also similarly produce alloys<br>
in which a co-precipitation of Silver and Quick silver (mer-<br>
cury) , Titan, Nickel, Copper, Cobalt or Bismuth be imple-<br>
mented.<br>
Specially for the Chlorine alkali-electrolysis it is possi-<br>
ble to under-talie changes at the finished gas diffussion<br>
electrode, which render possible a better transport of the<br>
developing caustic-sodat For this purpose, for example, the<br>
induction of a coarse deflecting system would be advisable.<br>
This is possible, if on the finished electrode a network<br>
is pressed and subsequently is drawn out again. The negative<br>
pressure of the network builds channels, in which the elec-<br>
trolyte can flow off later parallel to the electrode surface.<br>
