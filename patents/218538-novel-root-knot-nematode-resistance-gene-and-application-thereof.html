				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL ROOT-KNOT NEMATODE-RESISTANCE GENE AND<br>
APPLICATION THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel root-knot nematode-resistance gene.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel root-knot nematode-resistance<br>
gene that is unaffected by high temperature and is applicable to and quantitatively<br>
resistant to a wide variety of root-knot nematode species and strains. Further, the<br>
present invention relates to a method for using such gene.<br>
Background Art<br>
Nematodes are animal species that constitute a large phylum and are a type of<br>
harmful organisms parasitizing plants or animals. In general, root-knot nematodes<br>
parasitizing plants are 1 mm or shorter in length. However, they absorb nourishment<br>
from plant cell cytoplasms, and the damage caused thereby represents as much as<br>
approximately one billion dollars per year worldwide. Up to the present, approximately<br>
70 species of root-knot nematodes belonging to the genus Meloidogyne have been<br>
identified. Since they parasitize all types of crops and a wide variety of weeds, they are<br>
reported to adversely affect over 2,000 plant species, including sweet potatoes, tomatoes,<br>
and Irish potatoes.<br>
When a plant is infected with root-knot nematodes, no distinctive symptom that<br>
would be effective for determining parasitism at the initial stage is observed in the aerial<br>
part; however, a gall or knot begins to form below the ground. The size of such gall or<br>
knot varies depending on the species or variety thereof, and is approximately 1 to 2 mm<br>
in many cases. Thus, such gall or knot is sometimes difficult to visually observe,<br>
although egg masses laid on the surface of the gall or knot or on roots can be visually<br>
observed.    The most significant symptom is a vertical crack appearing on the root or<br><br>
tuber, and nematodes at various developmental stages parasitize the infected, root or<br>
tuber. Root-knot nematode infection not only lowers crop yields but also drastically<br>
reduces or eliminates the market value of the infected root or tuber. Also, a crack<br>
created on a root or tuber allows other pathogenic organisms to easily attack the plant,<br>
which in turn increases the likelihood of complex infection (Hooker, W. J., Compendium<br>
of Potato Diseases, pp. 97-98, 1981, The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul<br>
Minnesota, U.S.A.; Jansson &amp; Raman, Sweet Potato Pest Management, pp. 1-12, 1991,<br>
Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, U.S.A.; Jones et al., Compendium of Tomato<br>
Diseases, pp. 49-50, 1991, APS PRESS, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A.).<br>
Nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne parasitizing potatoes are of the following<br>
four species: Meloidogyne (M.) arenaria Chitwood; M. incognita Chitwood; M. hapla<br>
Chitwood; and M. javanica Chitwood. Among them, the Meloidogyne incognita<br>
nematode is generated with the highest frequency in potato fields worldwide (Hooker, W.<br>
J., Compendium of Potato Diseases, pp. 97-98, 1981, The American Phytopathological<br>
Society, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A.). Nematode infection is observed in potato<br>
cultivating areas in Kyushu, Japan, where the weather is warm. Accordingly,<br>
conferment of resistance upon crops or development of integrated pest control<br>
techniques is desired.<br>
In the case of potatoes, root-knot nematodes have been controlled for a long time<br>
via crop rotation. This technique is effective in terms of reduction of the population<br>
density of nematodes; however, control of root-knot nematodes simply via crop rotation<br>
is difficult in the case of omnivorous root-knot nematodes due to limitations concerning<br>
the cycle of crop rotation. Alternatively, the population density of root-knot nematodes<br>
can be restricted with the aid of ammonia nitrogen by adding organic fertilizers. This<br>
technique is still employed in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America at present,<br>
although it is not an ultimate method of control of root-knot nematodes. Soil<br>
fumigation with dichloropropene, methyl bromide, or the like is the best technique in<br>
terms of speed of action. This technique, however, adversely affects the ecosystem and<br>
farmers.<br>
Currently, a technique for enhancing the nematode resistance of host potatoes<br>
has been experimentally carried out, and a variety of resistant lines have been created<br>
(Watanabe et al., Amer. Potato J. 71: 599-604, 1994; Watanabe et al., Breeding Science<br>
45: 341-347, 1995; Watanabe et al., Breeding Science 46: 329-336, 1996; Watanabe et al.<br>
Breeding Science 49: 53-61, 1999; Watanabe &amp; Watanabe, Plant Biotechnology 17: 1-16,<br>
2000). Tetraploid potato cultivars that are highly resistant to nematodes, particularly to<br>
Meloidogyne incognita, have not yet been created.<br>
Conferment of resistance using root-knot nematode-resistant diploid wild<br>
relatives upon cultivated potatoes has been attempted. Based on genetic analysis of<br>
phenotypes or breeding experiments, diploid wild relatives have been found to comprise<br>
root-knot nematode-resistance genes (Rmi), and these genes have been found to have<br>
quantitative resistance with additive effects (Iwanaga et al., J. Amer. J. Hort Sci., 114<br>
(6): 1008-1113, 1989; Watanabe et al., Breeding Sci., 46: 323-369, 1996; Watanabe et<br>
al., Breeding Sci., 49: 53-61, 1999). In the aforementioned literature, resistance<br>
induced by such Rmi genes is reported to be unaffected by temperature and to be active<br>
at high temperatures. The Rmi is, however, not yet isolated, and the sequence thereof<br>
is not yet known. Since cultivated potatoes are autotetraploids, the heredity patterns<br>
thereof are complicated. Thus, the breeding of a useful resistant variety has not yet<br>
been realized.<br>
At present, the positions of a group of genes resistant to the genus Meloidogyne<br>
on several gene maps have only been verified regarding tomatoes and potatoes. In the<br>
case of tomatoes, for example, the Lycopersicon. peruvianum-derived Mi gene resistant<br>
to Meloidogyne incognita Chitwood, Meloidogyne javanica Chitwood, and Meloidogyne<br>
arenaria Chitwood is reported to be located on chromosome 6 (Messeguer et al., Theor.<br>
Appl. Genet., 82: 529-536, 1991; Ho et al., Plant J., 2: 971-982, 1992). The L.<br>
peruvianum-derived Mi3 gene resistant to Meloidogyne incognita Chitwood and<br>
Meloidogyne javanica Chitwood is also reported to be located on chromosome 12<br>
(Yaghoobi et al., Theor. Appl. Genet., 91: 457-464, 1995).    The Mi gene was isolated<br>
by the group of Williamson et al., and the constitution thereof has been elucidated (Rossi<br><br>
et al., Proc Natl Acad. Sci, 95: 9750-9754, 1998; Milligan et al.5 Plant Cell, 10:<br>
1307-1319, 1998). Since the Mi gene is affected by high temperature, the resistance<br>
thereof becomes disadvantageously inactive upon exposure to high temperatures during<br>
the initial stage of infection, i.e., 24 to 48 hours after infection.<br>
In the case of potatoes, Rmcl resistant to the Meloidogyne chitwoodi race 1 is<br>
reported to be located on chromosome 11 of 5". bulbocastanum (Brown et al., Theor Appl.<br>
Genet., 92: 572-576, 1996). Concerning transmission of resistance to Meloidogyne<br>
incognita Chitwood, the following two possibilities have been pointed out: 1) two or<br>
more genes may be involved with resistance (Gomez et al., Amer. Potato J., 60: 353-360,<br>
1983); and 2) cytoplasm may be involved with development of resistance (Gomez et al.,<br>
Amer. Potato J., 60: 353-360, 1983; Iwanaga et al., J. Amer. Hort. Sci., 114: 1108-1013.<br>
1989). Further, resistance to Meloidogyne incognita Chitwood is found to be additive<br>
and quantitative resistance that is controlled by 5 or 6 resistance genes (Watanabe et al.,<br>
Breed. Sci., 9: 53-61, 1999; Watanabe et al. submitted).<br>
In general, potent resistance of plants to pathogens is often very highly specific.<br>
The "gene-for-gene" hypothesis proposed by Flor (Flor, Ann. Rev. Phytopathol., 9:<br>
275-296, 1971) describes such highly specific resistance based on the interaction<br>
between resistance genes of plants and avirulence genes of pathogens. It is generally<br>
hypothesized that a ligand-receptor model is a mechanism for gene-for-gene molecule<br>
recognition (Gabriel &amp; Rolfe, Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 28: 365-391, 1990).<br>
Up to the present, the isolated resistance genes are classified into 5 groups based<br>
on functional or structural similarities of gene products (Baker et al., Science, 276: 726,<br>
1997; Bergelson et al., Science 292: 2281-2285, 2001; Dangl and Jones, Nature 411:<br>
826-833, 2001). The resistance genes classified as class I have nucleotide-binding sites<br>
(NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRR), and it is deduced that these regions are involved<br>
with signal transduction for developing resistance. Examples of the isolated genes<br>
classified as class I include: the N gene of tobacco resistant to tobacco mosaic virus<br>
(Whitham et al., Cell, 78: 1101-1105, 1994); the L6 (Lawrence et al., Plant Cell, 7:<br>
1195-1206, 1995) and M (Anderson et al., Plant Cell, 9: 641-651, 1997) genes of flax<br><br>
resistant to Melampsora lini; the RPP5 (Bent, Plant Cell, 8: 1757-1771, 1996) gene of<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana resistant to Peronospora parasitica, the RPS2 (Bent et ah, Science<br>
265: 1856-1860, 1993; Mindrinos et al., Cell, 78: 1089-1099, 1994) and the RPM1<br>
(Grant et al., Science, 269; 843-846, 1995) genes thereof resistant to Pseudomonas<br>
syringae; and the PRF (Salmeron et al., Cell 86: 123-133, 1996) gene of tomatoes<br>
resistant to Pseudomonas syringae and the I2C-1 (Ori et al., Plant Cell 9: 521-531, 1997)<br>
gene thereof resistant to Fusarium oxysporum. Further, the aforementioned L.<br>
peruvianum-derived Mi gene of tomatoes resistant to root-knot-nematodes is also found<br>
to have NBS and LRR (Milligan et al., Plant Cell 10: 1307-1319, 1998).<br>
A protein belonging to class I has incomplete LRR on its C-terminal side and<br>
NBS on its N-terminal side. NBS is observed in ATPase, GTPase, and the like, and is<br>
constituted by 3 motifs including a P loop (Traut, Eur J. Biochem., 229: 9-19, 1994). In<br>
general, the first kinase 1 a domain forms a phosphoric acid-binding loop, and the kinase<br>
2 domain is located downstream thereof. Aspartic acid immobilized in the kinase 2<br>
domain is deduced to adjust a metal-binding site that is necessary for migration of<br>
phosphoric acid. The kinase 3a domain located further downstream thereof has<br>
tyrosine or arginine that often interacts with purine in ATP (Traut, Eur J. Biochem., 229:<br>
9-19, 1994). Existence of such NBS indicates that kinase activity or the G-protein<br>
plays a key role in activating resistance (Hammond-Kosack &amp; Jones, 1997, Annu. Rev.<br>
Plant Phusiol. Plany Mol. Bioi., 48: 575-607, 1997).<br>
The LRR domain is observed in a variety of proteins, and it is considered to be<br>
often involved with protein-protein interactions in yeast, Drosophila, human, or other<br>
species (Kobe &amp; Deisenhofer, Nature, 366: 751-756, 1993). Concerning plant<br>
resistance to pests, however, it is deduced that the LRR domain functions as a<br>
ligand-binding domain produced from avirulence (Avr) genes or facilitates interactions<br>
between the products of resistant (R) genes and other proteins involved with defense<br>
signal transduction (Bent, Plant Cell, 8: 1757-1771, 1996).<br>
Potatoes are major crops worldwide, and they are excellent crops that are<br>
compatible with  a wide range  of production  systems  from high-input agriculture<br><br>
conducted in developed countries such as the U.S.A. and Japan to low-input agriculture<br>
conducted in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Potatoes are<br>
extensively cultivated for applications such as feeds, industrial starch, and fermentation<br>
material as well as for food such as staple food, vegetables, or snacks worldwide (Harris,<br>
P.M. The Potato Crop, Chapman and Hall, London, 1978; International Potato Center<br>
http://www.cgiar.org.cip/ 2004). From the viewpoint of the amount of production and<br>
calorie supply, potatoes are one of the most important crops particularly in developing<br>
countries. In these countries where the populations are drastically increasing, an<br>
increased amount of production and productivity of potatoes will be further expected for<br>
this valuable food source in years to come.<br>
A large amount of potatoes produced have been lost due to pests, and damage<br>
caused by root-knot nematodes has been particularly serious in extensive areas covering<br>
tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions (Hooker, W. J., Compendium of Potato<br>
Diseases, pp. 97-98, 1981, The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul Minnesota,<br>
U.S.A.).<br>
Unfortunately, there is no ultimate solution for the damage caused by root-knot<br>
nematodes, and thus, elucidation of functions and structures of resistance genes has been<br>
awaited.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a solution for serious damage<br>
caused by root-knot nematodes by discovering an excellent root-knot<br>
nematode-resistance gene that is extensively applicable to a variety of root-knot<br>
nematode species.<br>
The present inventors have screened diploid potato lines based on nucleotide<br>
sequences such as NBS or LRR that are common among a group of plants" resistance<br>
genes. As a result, they have succeeded in isolating a novel gene having excellent<br>
root-knot nematode resistance.     They have  also  succeeded in producing  excellent<br>
root-knot nematode-resistant transgenic plants via utilization of the aforementioned gene,<br>
thereby completing the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to the following (1) to (8).<br>
(1) A gene consisting of the following DNA (a) or (b):<br>
(a) DNA consisting of the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:<br>
1; or<br>
(b) DNA hybridizing under stringent conditions to DNA consisting of a<br>
nucleotide sequence complementary with the DNA consisting of the nucleotide<br>
sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:   1  and conferring root-knot nematode<br>
resistance upon a host.<br>
(2)  The gene according to (1), wherein the root-knot nematode resistance is<br>
quantitative resistance where the level of resistance increases depending on the number<br>
of gene copies.<br>
(3) A recombinant vector comprising the gene according to (1).<br>
(4) A transformant obtained by introducing the gene according to (1) into a host.<br>
(5) The transformant according to (4), wherein the host is a plant.<br>
(6)  The transformant according to (5), wherein the plant is of the Solanaceae<br>
family.<br>
(7)  A method for producing a root-knot nematode-resistant transgenic plant by<br>
introducing the gene according to (1) into the plant.<br>
(8)  An agent for root-knot nematode control comprising the gene according to<br>
(1).<br>
1. Novel root-knot nematode-resistance gene<br>
(1) Characteristics of the gene according to the present invention<br>
The gene according to the present invention is a novel root-knot<br>
nematode-resistance gene isolated from a diploid potato Line. This gene differs from<br>
conventional root-knot nematode-resistance genes in the following respects:<br>
(i) unlike a single dominant root-knot nematode-resistance gene such as a<br>
resistance gene of a tomato (the Mi gene), the gene according to the present invention<br>
has "quantitative resistance" where the degree of resistance is enhanced in accordance<br>
with the number of gene copies;<br>
(ii) unlike the resistance gene of a tomato, resistance breakdown does not occur<br>
because of high-temperature sensitivity; and<br>
(iii) the gene according to the present invention can be extensively applied to a<br>
wide variety of root-knot nematode species and strains.<br>
(2) Isolation of the gene according to the present invention<br>
The gene according to the present invention can be screened from genomic DNA<br>
or a cDNA library of the diploid potato genotype 85.37.38 that is known to have a<br>
root-knot nematode-resistance gene (Watanabe et al., Amer. Potato J. 71: 599-604, 1994)<br>
based on sequence information such as NBS or LRR that is common among a group of<br>
plants" resistance genes. For example, primers may be designed from a domain<br>
conserved in known plants" genes resistant to pests, such as a NBS or LRR sequence,<br>
based on the general theory of Hammond-Kosack and Jones (Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol.<br>
Plan Mol. Biol. 48: 575-607, 1997) or the like. These primers may be used to amplify<br>
the gene of interest isolated from the aforementioned cDNA library of the diploid potato<br>
line.<br>
(3) Nucleotide sequencing<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the obtained gene can be determined in accordance<br>
with a conventional technique. Nucleotide sequencing may be carried out by a<br>
conventional technique, such as chemical modification developed by Maxam &amp; Gilbert,<br>
dideoxynucleotide chain termination utilizing an M13 phage, or a method utilizing an<br>
automated nucleotide sequence analyzer (e.g., ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequence System,<br>
Perkin-Elmer).<br><br>
In order to allow a foreign gene to express in a host, a promoter and a terminator<br>
need to be located in front of and behind the gene, respectively. Any promoter and<br>
terminator can be used without particular limitation as long as they can function in a host.<br>
When a plant is a host, examples of a promoter sequence include cauliflower mosaic<br>
virus (CaMV)-derived 35S transcript (The EMBO J. 6: 3901-3907, 1987), maize<br>
ubiquitin (Plant Mol. Biol. 18: 675-689, 1992), nopaline synthase (NOS) gene, and<br>
octopine (OCT) synthase gene promoters. Examples of a terminator sequence include<br>
cauliflower mosaic virus-derived and nopaline synthase gene-derived terminators.<br>
In order to more effectively select the transformant of interest, an effective<br>
selection marker gene is preferably introduced. Examples of the selection marker gene<br>
include a kanamycin-resistance-conferring gene, a hygrornycin phosphotransferase (htp)<br>
gene conferring antibiotic hygromycin-resistance upon a plant, and a phosphinothricin<br>
acetyltransferase (bar) gene conferring bialaphos resistance upon a plant. Such<br>
selection marker gene and the gene according to the present invention may be<br>
incorporated together into a single vector. Alternatively, 2 types of recombinant DNAs<br>
independently comprising them in separate vectors may be used.<br>
3. Transformant<br>
The present invention also provides a transformant into which the gene<br>
according to the present invention has been introduced. This transformant is produced<br>
by transforming a host by using the aforementioned vector according to the present<br>
invention. The host is not particularly limited as long as the gene according to the<br>
present invention can function therein. It is preferably a plant, and examples thereof<br>
include a plant of the Solanaceae family, a plant of the Convolvulaceae family such as<br>
sweet potato, and a plant of the Brassicaceae family including root crops such as radish.<br>
The gene according to the present invention is considered to be capable of effectively<br>
functioning in over 2,000 species of plants. Plants of the Solanaceae family, such as<br>
potatoes, tobacco, and tomatoes are particularly preferable.    The term "plant" used in<br>
the present invention refers to cultured  cells of plants cultivated plants, plant organs<br><br>
(e.g., leaves, flower petals, stems, roots, rhizomes, or seeds), or plant tissues (e.g.,<br>
epidermis, phloem, parenchyma, xylem, or fibrovascular bundle). When cultured cells<br>
of plants, the entirety of the plants, plant organs, or plant tissues are used as hosts, for<br>
example, the gene according to the present invention is introduced into a piece of the<br>
obtained plant via the Agrobacterium binary vector method, the particle gun method, the<br>
polyethylene glycol method, or other method. Thus, a transformant of interest can be<br>
obtained. Alternatively, the gene may be introduced into protoplast via electroporation<br>
to prepare a transformant.<br>
The transformant into which the gene according to the present invention has<br>
been introduced can be selected via screening using a selection marker or analysis of the<br>
functions of the gene according to the present invention, i.e., root-knot nematode<br>
resistance. The resulting transformant, particularly a transgenic plant, can be<br>
propagated by cultivation in a pot filled with soil or vermiculite and by cutting. The<br>
thus propagated transgenic plants and all the offspring thereof are within the scope of the<br>
transformant according to the present invention as long as they comprise the gene<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
4. Root-knot nematode-resistant transgenic plant<br>
The transgenic plant into which the root-knot nematode-resistance gene<br>
according to the present invention has been introduced has potent resistance to a wide<br>
variety of root-knot nematode species. In addition, resistance conferred by the gene<br>
according to the present invention is "quantitative resistance," where the degree of<br>
resistance is enhanced in accordance with the number of genes introduced. It should be<br>
noted that conventional root-knot nematode-resistance genes do not have quantitative<br>
resistance. Accordingly, the gene according to the present invention can produce a<br>
transgenic plant having more potent root-knot nematode resistance by increasing the<br>
number of genes to be introduced.<br>
Root-knot nematode-resistance genes that have been identified up to the present<br>
are affected by temperature and lose their resistance upon exposure to a temperature over<br><br>
a given level (the Mi gene is usually deactivated at 28°C). The transgenic plant according<br>
to the present to the present invention, however, can maintain its resistance to root-knot<br>
nematodes even when it is cultivated at high temperatures between 33°C and 35°C.<br>
Accordingly, the transgenic plant into which the gene according to the present invention<br>
has been introduced can maintain its root-knot nematode resistance in temperate or<br>
tropical regions, where temperature is relatively high.<br>
Thus, the present invention can provide a novel root-knot nematode-resistant transgenic<br>
plant and a method for producing the same.<br>
5.        Others<br>
The gene according to the present invention confers excellent root-knot nematode<br>
resistance upon a host, particularly to plants of the Solanaceae family, such as potatoes,<br>
tobacco, and tomatoes. Accordingly, such gene and a composition comprising the same<br>
can be used as an agent for root-knot nematode control. The gene according to the present<br>
invention, a transgenic plant into which such gene has been introduced, and an agent for<br>
root-knot nematode control comprising such gene have important effects of containing<br>
the damage and improving the productivity of crops in regions where serious damage is<br>
caused by root-knot nematodes.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention is hereafter described in more detail with reference to the<br>
following examples, although the technical scope of the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto.<br>
[Example 1] Isolation of gene domain<br>
The following primers were designed from genomic DNA of the diploid potato<br>
genotype 85.37.38 known to have resistance genes (Watanabe et al., Amer. Potato J. 71:<br>
599-604, 1994), and the gene was isolated by PCR.    The primers were designed from a<br>
domain conserved in known plants" genes resistant to pests, such as the sequence NBS or<br>
LRR.<br>
Forward: 5"-GATCCATTCTATAATGTCTCACT-3" (SEQ ID NO: 2)<br>
Reverse: 5"-CTATCTATAAGATCTTTAATCA-3" (SEQ ID NO: 3)<br>
The isolated Rmi gene candidate was designated as "Fragment #93," arid the<br>
total sequence thereof (SEQ ID NO: 1) and homology thereof with known genes were<br>
inspected (Table 1).<br><br>
A foreign gene was inserted between border sequences of the binary vector, and<br>
the resulting recombinant vector was amplified in E. coli. Subsequently, the amplified<br>
recombinant vector was introduced into, for example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens<br>
LBA4404, EHA101, EHA105, or C58ClRifR, via freeze thawing, electroporation, or<br>
other means.    The resultant was used for producing a transgenic plant.<br>
[Example 2] Construction of vector<br>
(1) Insertion into binary vector<br>
The isolated Rmi gene candidate (Fragment #93) was cleaved with BamHI,<br>
ligated to the pTarget vector once, cleaved with BamHl again, and then ligated to a<br>
binary vector pBE2113Not. The resulting recombinant vector was introduced into E.<br>
coli DH5oc and amplified therein to obtain a vector for Agrobacterium introduction<br>
(PotatoRKN: pBE2113NotI).<br>
(2) Electroporation<br>
The binary vector (PotatoRKN: pBE2113NotI) was introduced into the<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens LB4404 strain (Gibco BRL) via electroporation.<br>
Specifically, the Agrobacterium tumefaciens LB4404 strain stored at -80°C was thawed<br>
on ice, and approximately 20 µ1 thereof was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube<br>
under clean bench conditions. DNA (100 ng/µl, 1 µl) was added thereto, the mixture<br>
was allowed to stand on ice, and the resultant was then transferred to a cuvette for<br>
electroporation.<br>
(3) Confirmation of gene introduction<br>
Subsequently, 50 (J.1 of YM medium was added, suctioned, and transferred to a<br>
15-ml Falcon tube. YM medium was further added to bring the total amount to 1 ml,<br>
and shaking culture was carried out at 225 ppm and 30°C for 3 hours. Three hours<br>
thereafter, 200 µl of the culture product was spread on kanamycin-containing YM agar<br>
medium, culture was carried out at 30°C for 48 to 56 hours, and the generated colony<br>
was subjected to PCR and DNA sequencing to confirm gene introduction.<br>
(4) Colony PCR<br>
The colony of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain, gene<br>
introduction into which had been verified, was removed, and colony PCR was conducted<br>
using the reaction solution having the composition as shown in Table 2. The resulting<br>
PCR product (1 µ1) was removed and then mixed with a small amount of blue juice.<br>
The mixture was then electrophoresed in a gel comprising 2% of agarose dissolved in<br>
0.5% TAE.    A A. Hind III marker (Marker II, Boehringer Mannheim) was used.<br>
Thereafter, a solution having the composition as shown in Table 2 was poured into<br><br>
8-strip tubes, and the tubes were mounted on the PCR apparatus (GeneAmp 9600,<br>
Perkin-Elmer).<br>
The above reaction solution was transferred to a 1.5-ml Locking Tube, and 80 \xl<br>
of 75% isopropanol was added thereto, followed by mixing. The resulting mixture was<br>
then allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes and centrifuged for 20 minutes<br>
(at room temperature and the maximal rate). The supernatant was removed therefrom,<br>
and 250 µl of 75% isopropanol was further added, followed by mixing. Thereafter, the<br>
mixture was centrifuged for 5 minutes (at room temperature and the maximal rate), the<br>
supernatant was removed, and the centrifugation product was dehydrated in a draft<br>
chamber. Subsequently, 25 µ1 each of the template suppression reagent (TSR) was<br>
added and mixed, the mixture was spun down, and heat shock was applied in a Heat<br>
Block at 95°C for 3 minutes. The resultant was allowed to stand on ice and then<br>
transferred to a DNA sequencing 310-specific tube.    DNA sequencing was then carried<br>
out.<br>
The colony of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens LB 4404 strain, gene introduction<br>
into which had been verified, was removed, and the colony was subjected to shaking<br>
culture in YEB medium containing 100 mg/1 of kanamycin at 30°C and 225 rpm<br>
overnight. The solution of cultured cells (850 jjlI each) was poured into cryotubes on<br>
ice, 150 \x\ of glycerin was added, the tubes were sealed and wrapped with Parafilm, and<br><br>
the contents of the tubes were mixed using a vortex mixer.    The resultant was wrapped<br>
in plastic wrap and then immersed in 99.5% ethanol, which had been cooled to -20°C,<br>
and then allowed to cool in a freezer at -20°C for approximately 10 minutes.    Thereafter,<br>
the resultant was stored in a storage case which had been cooled to -80°C.<br>
[Example 3] Production of transgenic plant<br>
A transgenic plant into which a domain of the root-knot nematode-resistance<br>
gene has been introduced using the vector prepared in Example 2 was produced.<br>
Diploid Nicotiana benthamiana (a plant of the Solanaceae family), which is<br>
redifferentiated and grown at the early stage and is nematode-sensitive, was used as a<br>
host plant. In parallel therewith, the gene was introduced into the nematode-sensitive<br>
tetraploid potato variety, Desiree.<br>
(1) Infection of plant with Agrobacterium tumefaciens<br>
The Agrobacterium tumefaciens LB4404 strain prepared in Example 2 was<br>
allowed to thaw on ice. YEB medium (40 ml) was transferred to 50-ml Falcon tubes<br>
under clean bench conditions, and antibiotics were added thereto, followed by mixing in<br>
the reverse order. The resulting mixture was poured into the tubes in amounts of 10 ml<br>
per tube. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain (10 µ1) was added thereto,<br>
the resultant was cultured in a shake culture apparatus overnight (at 28°C and 225 rpm),<br>
and the absorbance of the culture solution at 600 nm was assayed using a<br>
spectrophotometer. Since the absorbance at this time was approximately 2, the culture<br>
solution was diluted with the aid of YEB medium to bring the absorbance to a level<br>
between 0.6 and 0.8.<br>
A plant 2 to 3 weeks after subculturing was marked with a surgical scalpel on<br>
sterilized filter paper, divided into the root, stem, and leaf portions, and then immersed<br>
in sterilized water to prevent drying. The marked plant fragment was immersed in a<br>
solution of Agrobacterium tumefaciens adjusted to have absorbance between 0.6 and 0.8<br>
for 7 minutes, transferred onto sterilized filter paper, thoroughly drained, and then<br>
cultured in a co-culture medium for 3  days.    The co-culture medium used herein<br><br>
contained 1 mg/1 of benzyladenine (BA), 35 mg/1 of trans-zeatin riboside, and 0.1 mg/1<br>
of indoleacetic acid.<br>
(2) Subculturing to co-culture medium<br>
As with the case of the section above, a co-culture medium was prepared, 20 ml<br>
thereof was poured into each petri dish, sterilized round filter paper was placed thereon,<br>
and the infected plant was transferred thereto, followed by culturing for 3 days.<br>
(3) Subculturing to callus-forming medium<br>
A callus-forming medium was prepared by adding 1 mg/1 of benzyladenine, 0.1<br>
mg/1 of NAA, 150 mg/1 of kanamycin, and 200 mg/1 of carbenicillin to the modified MS<br><br>
medium as shown in Table 3. The prepared medium was poured into petri dishes in<br>
amounts of 20 ml per dish. The plant fragments that had been cultured in a symbiotic<br>
medium for 3 days were successively subcultured in the aforementioned callus-forming<br>
medium.<br>
(4) Subculturing to shoot-growing medium<br>
A shoot-growing medium was prepared by adding 150 mg/1 of kanamycin and<br>
200 mg/1 of carbenicillin to the modified MS medium as shown in Table 3, and the<br>
prepared medium was poured into petri dishes in amounts of 20 ml per dish. The plant<br>
fragments that had been cultured in callus-forming medium for approximately 2 weeks<br>
where a callus had been formed were successively subcultured in the aforementioned<br>
shoot-growing medium. Culture was then carried out in a room lit by light (fluorescent<br>
light) all day long.<br>
(5) Subculturing to MS medium-containing test tubes<br>
The modified MS medium as shown in Table 3 was poured into test tubes in<br>
amounts of 5 ml per tube, and the tubes were sterilized in an autoclave. Among the<br>
plants that had been redifferentiated in a shoot-growing medium, the plants that had<br>
become completely independent were subcultured as a single line in the sterilized test<br>
tubes.<br>
(6)  Subculturing to rooting medium<br>
Kanamycin (75 mg/1) and 100 mg/1 of carbenicillin were added to the modified<br>
MS medium as shown in Table 3, and the resultant was poured into culture bottles in<br>
amounts of 40 ml per bottle to prepare a rooting medium. Plants that had reached a size<br>
of 2 to 3 cm after 1 to 2 weeks of culture in the MS medium-containing test tubes were<br>
successively subcultured in the aforementioned rooting medium in quantities of<br>
approximately 3 plants per bottle.<br><br>
(7) Conditioning<br>
Commercially available vegetable soil was placed in a planter, culture was<br>
carried out in a rooting medium for approximately 3 weeks, and plants, the roots of<br>
which had matured, were transferred thereto and grown therein.<br>
[Example 4] Confirmation of gene introduction via Southern hybridization<br>
The regenerated plants were grown in a selection medium, i.e., a<br>
kanamycin-containing medium, and rooting-based growth was employed as an indicator<br>
to select a line with good growing conditions as a provisional candidate for the<br>
transgenic plant. This candidate for the transgenic plant was subjected to Southern<br>
hybridization to confirm gene introduction.<br>
(1) Testing method<br>
DNA of the aforementioned provisional candidate line for the transgenic plant<br>
was extracted, and PCR was carried out using primers (SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3) used in<br>
Example 1 to amplify a domain of the root-knot nematode-resistance gene.<br>
The line, introduction of a gene domain into which had been verified via PCR,<br>
was subjected to Southern hybridization using the sequence of Rmi (SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
determined in Example 1 as a probe, and the number of genes introduced was estimated.<br>
The hybridization conditions are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
According to the results shown in Fig. 1, positive reactions were also observed<br>
in the control. These positive reactions were considered to occur because the control<br>
gene had a homologous domain which hybridizes to a non-transgenic plant. Therefore,<br>
plants having bands with conditions different from those of the control and having a<br>
larger number of bands than the control were determined to be plants into which genes<br>
have been introduced.<br>
[Example 5] Confirmation of gene introduction via RT-PCR<br>
(1) Testing method<br>
1) Synthesis of cDNA<br>
Plants were ground to powder using liquid nitrogen in a mortar and mRNA was<br>
extracted in accordance with a conventional technique. Reverse transcription of the<br>
mRNA was conducted using the reaction composition as shown in Table 5 and primers<br>
prepared by adding dT to random 9 mer and Ml3 primer M4 attached to the Takara RNA<br>
PCR Kit (Takara) to synthesize cDNA. The primers used and the reaction conditions<br>
are as shown below.<br><reaction utilizing random mers primer><br>
Random 9 mer: dp(5"-NNNNNNNNN-3")<br>
Reaction conditions: preincubation at 30°C for 10 minutes;<br>
a cycle of 42°C for 30 minutes, 99°C for 5 minutes, and 55°C for 5 minutes<br><reaction utilizing oligo dt-adaptor primer><br>
Primers prepared by adding Oligo-dT to the oligo-dT adaptor: Ml3 primer M4<br>
5"-gttttcccagtcacgac-3" (SEQ ID NO: 4) was used.<br>
Reaction conditions: a cycle of 42°C for 30 minutes, 99°C for 5 minutes, and<br>
55°C for 5 minutes<br>
2)PCR<br>
Subsequently, PCR was carried out using the obtained cDNA.    PCR was<br>
carried out using the GeneAmp 9600 (Applied Biosystems) and the primers shown below<br>
(RKN, Start2x2., and PotaLRR) under the following conditions.<br><pcr utilizing primer rkn><br>
Primer RKN-F1: GTTGGTCATGAAAATGAA (SEQ ID NO: 5)<br>
Primer RKN-R1: ATATTGCTCTTCCAATCA (SEQ ID NO: 6)<br>
Reaction condition: 30 cycles of 95°C for 10 minutes, 95°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 2<br>
minutes, and 72°C for 3 minutes<br>
Final elongation at 72°C for 10 minutes<br><reaction utilizing primers start2x2 and potalrr><br>
Primer Start2X2: ATGGCTTATGCTGCTATTACTTGT (SEQ ID NO: 7)<br>
Primer PotaLRR: CTAACTGATACAGACCTCAACAGA (SEQ ID NO: 8)<br>
Reaction condition: 30 cycles of 95°C for 10 minutes, 95°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 2<br>
minutes, and 72°C for 3 minutes<br>
Final elongation at 72°C for 10 minutes<br>
3) Electrophoresis<br>
The PCR products obtained above were electrophoresed, and band differences<br>
thereamong were compared to evaluate the occurrence of gene introduction.<br>
(2) Results<br>
The results of RT-PCR are shown in Fig. 2. When the primer RKN and the<br>
primers Start2x2 and PotaLRR were used, no band was observed in the control, although<br>
a band was detected in the candidates for the transgenic plant (plants 8 and 9). Thus,<br>
gene introduction to and transcription in the transgenic plants were confirmed.<br>
[Example 6] Evaluation of resistance of transgenic plants<br>
(1) Testing method<br>
The transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (e.g., Nos. 1, 8, 14, and 18), gene<br>
introduction into which had been verified, the non-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana,<br>
and the nematode-sensitive tomato variety TA209 were infected with Meloidogyne<br>
incognita. Conditions of aerial parts and roots of the plants were observed visually and<br>
microscopically.<br><br>
The transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (e.g., Nos. 1, 8, 14, and 18), gene<br>
introduction into which had been verified, the non-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana,<br>
and TA209 were cultivated in Meloidogyne incognita-infected soil to evaluate resistance.<br>
Evaluation was carried out in accordance with a conventional technique (Williamson et<br>
al., Plant Cell, 1998), root-knot nematode eggs were stained with Erioglaucine<br>
(Sigma-Aldrich), and the presence or absence and the number of eggs were examined to<br>
evaluate the resistance. At this time, the presence of galls in the roots was also<br>
examined. Thus, the correlation between the number of genes introduced and the<br>
nematode resistance was inspected.<br>
(2) Results<br>
Concerning the conditions of the aerial parts of the transgenic plants, the degree<br>
of etiolation was not advanced from that of the non-transgenic plant and that of TA209.<br>
The number of root-knots was also smaller. The roots were further observed under a<br>
microscope, and knot-like deformation was not observed in the root of the transgenic<br>
plant. However, knot-like deformation was observed in the root of the non-transgenic<br>
plant and in that of TA209, and a shadow that seemed like nematode egg was observed<br>
therein. Thus, a transgenic plant into which the gene according to the present invention<br>
has been introduced was verified to have high root-knot nematode resistance (Figs. 3 and<br>
4).<br>
Further, the transgenic plant according to the present invention could maintain<br>
its root-knot nematode resistance even when it was cultured and cultivated at high<br>
temperatures between 33°C and 35°C. Accordingly, the gene according to the present<br>
invention was confirmed to be unaffected by high temperature unlike the-Mi-gene (which<br>
is deactivated at 28°C).<br>
[Example 7] Evaluation of root-knot nematode resistance of wild-type tobacco<br>
(1) Testing method<br><br>
The nematode-resistant genes were introduced into wild-type tobacco using the<br>
vector prepared in Example 2 in accordance with the method described in Example 3.<br>
The lines into which the genes have been introduced were subjected to Southern<br>
hybridization and RT-PCR to confirm the gene introduction. Further, transgenic plants<br>
were planted in root-knot nematode-infected soil and allowed to grow in a greenhouse at<br>
30°C to 35°C during the day (for 16 hours) and at 25°C to 30°C during the night (for 8<br>
hours) for 6 weeks. The nematode resistance thereof was then evaluated. Resistance<br>
was evaluated by first observing the roots in terms of root knots and then<br>
microscopically observing the plants that did not have root knots. The results are<br>
shown in Table 8.<br>
(2) Results<br>
As is apparent from Table 8, the root-knot nematode-resistance gene according<br>
to the present invention was confirmed to have quantitative resistance unlike<br>
conventional root-knot nematode-resistance genes such as the mi gene of a tomato.<br><br>
[Example 8] Evaluation of root-knot nematode resistance of cultivated potato species<br>
(1) Testing method<br>
The nematode-resistant genes were introduced into the cultivated potato species<br>
(Desiree) using the vector prepared in Example 2 in accordance with the method<br>
described in Example 3. The species into which the genes have been introduced were<br>
subjected to Southern hybridization, PCR, and RT-PCR to confirm the gene introduction.<br>
Further, transgenic plants were planted in root-knot nematode-infected soil and allowed<br>
to grow in a greenhouse at 30°C to 35°C during the day (for 16 hours) and at 25°C to<br>
30°C during the night (for 8 hours) for 6 weeks. The nematode resistance thereof was<br>
then evaluated in the same manner as in Example 7.    As controls, untreated Desiree,<br>
root-knot nematode-sensitive Atzimba (potato), TA209, and N. benthamiana were<br>
allowed to grow in the same manner and then evaluated. The results are shown in<br>
Table 9.<br>
(2) Results<br>
As is apparent from Table 9, the root-knot nematode-resistance gene according<br>
to the present invention was confirmed to exhibit quantitative resistance in the cultivated<br>
potato species.<br>

is unaffected by high temperature and is extensively applicable to and quantitatively<br>
resistant to a wide variety of root-knot nematode species and strains. Utilization of<br>
such gene enables conferment of high root-knot nematode resistance upon major crops,<br>
such as potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco.<br>
