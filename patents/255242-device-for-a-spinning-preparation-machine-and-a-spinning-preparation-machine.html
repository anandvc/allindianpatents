3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The present invention concerns a device for a spinning preparation machine, in particular for a drawframe or card, for placing a fibre sliver fed at a specifiable delivery speed by means of a delivery unit into a sliver can according to the preamble of Claim 1, and a spinning preparation machine according to the preamble of Claim 17.<br>
Placing a fibre sliver fed at a specifiable delivery speed by means of a delivery unit into a sliver can with the aid of a device of this general type is known from the state of art.<br>
The fibre sliver that is to be deposited is passed through a sliver duct associated with a turntable rotating about a vertical axis; the inlet opening to the sliver duct is concentric with the axis of rotation, while the outlet opening is located eccentrically with respect to the axis of rotation. A sliver can support device is provided to hold the sliver can that is to be filled, positioned in such a way that the opening of the sliver can faces the turntable as the sliver is deposited. The sliver can support device, moreover, is designed in such a way that the sliver can undergoes periodic movements as it is filled. "Periodic movement" of the sliver can here means that the sliver can is rotated and/or translated, and is returned to its initial position in a periodic cycle. This type of movement of the sliver can is to be distinguished from movement of the sliver can in the context of exchanging sliver cans. Due to the rotation of the turntable and the periodic movement of the sliver can, the outlet opening of the sliver duct describes as cycloidal path in relation to the sliver can.<br>
Now in order to be able to place the fibre sliver into the sliver can in a cycloidal pattern, it is necessary for the speed of the turntable to be matched to the speed of delivery. Depositing the sliver cycloidally is desirable because it permits the can to be filled evenly, and allows the fibre sliver to be withdrawn from the can easily at a later time.<br>
Depending on the speed of delivery, therefore, a base speed is specified and set for the rotation of the turntable, and is maintained until the delivery speed changes. Only when the delivery speed changes is the base speed adjusted in accordance with either a linear or a non-linear characteristic curve. The characteristic curve itself is normally only modified if it is found that sliver placement is faulty, at the change of a batch, or when the geometry of the placement is changed. While the continuous fibre sliver is being deposited, however, the characteristic curve that has once been specified is continuously followed, so that the actual speed of the turntable always corresponds to the base speed.<br>
As a general rule, the fibre sliver that is being deposited comprises particles that are only partially linked into the internal structure of the fibre sliver. Particles of this<br><br>
kind may, for instance, be short fibres or particles of dirt. As a consequence of the forces that act on the continuous fibre sliver as it is being deposited by a device of the general, usual type, a proportion of these particles separate from the structure of the fibre sliver, and these separated particles are only transported onwards with a loose association to the fibre sliver.<br>
A resulting disadvantage is that particles that separate now and again from the fibre sliver accumulate on the inner wall of the sliver duct. These collections of particles have a tendency to grow to a certain size as the device continues operation, and then to become detached from the inner wall as discrete particle bundles. The particle bundles often detach when the sliver can into which the fibre sliver is being placed is changed. Most often, these particle bundles (known as "mice") fall into the sliver can, and thereby contaminate the fibre sliver that has been put there. This can lead to problems with further processing of the fibre sliver.<br>
Accumulations of particles on the inner wall of the sliver duct can also cause damage to the fibre sliver that is to be deposited, particularly at high and very high deposition speeds. The particle accumulations can, for instance, lead to incorrect drafting of the sliver, or to a deterioration in the degree of parallelization of the fibres.<br>
It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide a device and a spinning preparation machine that overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages and that, in particular, prevent the formation of so-called mice, so that a high quality fibre sliver can safely and gently be deposited at high and very high speeds (in particular above 1000 m/min).<br>
This task is fulfilled by a device and a spinning preparation machine having the features of the independent patent claims.<br>
The present invention recognizes that a temporary drop in the speed of the turntable in comparison with the specified base speed has a cleaning effect in the sliver duct, in which some of the particles that have come loose from the fibre sliver are removed before they join together to form particle bundles. This cleaning effect occurs because the temporary drop in the speed of the turntable is carried out in such a way that it leads to a short-term reduction in the longitudinal tension within the fibre sliver, thereby leading to a short-term increase in the diameter of the fibre sliver. As a result, the entire inner surface of the sliver duct is brushed by the fibre sliver as it runs.<br>
It has, surprisingly, been found that the desired cleaning effect can be achieved even with a small percentage drop in the speed of the turntable associated with an extremely short duration. It has in this context also been found that the drop in the speed of the turntable results neither in damage to the fibre sliver, nor in a disturbance to the cycloidal deposition.<br><br><br>
In order to implement this novel idea, a device according to the invention features a drive system for the turntable constructed in such a way as to lower the speed of the turntable according to a specifiable profile. The speed of the turntable is lowered here while deposition of the fibre sliver continues into a sliver can that is to be filled. Prior to and after the drop in speed, the turntable is driven with the specified base speed.<br>
The temporary drop in the speed of the turntable can be implemented in a simple way by briefly interrupting the drive to the turntable. This interruption can, for instance, be created by switching off the supply voltage to a motor that powers the drive for a short time. It is equally possible for the turntable to be mechanically decoupled from the driving motor for an appropriate period of time. This approach avoids the possibility of the motor braking the turntable too sharply when the drive is interrupted. In this case, the profile mentioned above specifies the time and duration of the interruption to the drive while deposition continues. In this case it therefore consists of a drive interruption profile.<br>
The temporary drop in the speed of the turntable can, however, also be achieved by controlling and/or regulating the speed of the drive and thereby of the turntable. In this case, the profile specifies the speed of the turntable while deposition continues. Such a profile can therefore be referred to as a speed profile.<br>
Although it would also be conceivable for the drop in the speed of the turntable to be initiated and executed manually, it is nevertheless favourable if the drive system comprises a control unit for automatic control of the turntable speed in accordance with a specified speed profile and/or for automatic, temporary interruption of the drive to the turntable in accordance with a drive interruption profile as mentioned above. A control unit of this sort is favourably implemented as an electronic control unit.<br>
The control unit can favourably be connected to a machine controller on the spinning preparation machine in order to exchange data. This makes it possible, for instance, to operate the control unit through the machine controller's operating elements. In this case, the control unit does not have too incorporate an operating unit. It is also conceivable that the control unit could be entirely integrated into the machine controller. This further reduces the expense of the hardware.<br>
It is particularly favourable if a memory device is associated with the control unit, in which at least one predefined aforementioned speed profile and/or at least one drive interruption profile is stored. This simplifies operation of the control unit, as tedious entry of the parameters for lowering the speed of the turntable, such as the magnitude of the drop, the duration of the drop, the frequency of the drop and so on can be omitted. The desired speed profile or drive interruption profile only needs to<br><br><br>
be read from the memory and activated. It is of particular advantage here if a large number of profiles that can be read and activated according to the particular situation are stored. It is, for instance, possible to hold specially modified profiles ready for different fibre slivers, for different turntables and/ or for different sliver cans.<br>
Although it is indeed possible for a said profile to specify the speed of the turntable and/ or the temporary interruption of the drive to the turntable in accordance with time, it is nevertheless favourable if a said profile specifies the speed of the turntable and/or the temporary interruption of the drive to the turntable in dependency on the length of the transported fibre sliver. The reason for this is that the quantity of particles that come loose rises according to the length of transported sliver. It is also conceivable for both time and the length of the fibre sliver that has been transported to be taken account, as in this way it is also possible to take account of the fact that the quantity of particles coming loose rises as the delivery speed increases.<br>
If, for a given profile, a maximum drop in the speed of the turntable in relation to the specified base speed at the intervals concerned is set, the desired cleaning effect is achieved without resulting in damage to the fibre sliver or causing the fibre sliver to back up in the sliver duct.<br>
It is particularly favourable if a said profile comprises a repeating sequence. This simplifies specification of the profile, as only the parameters describing the sequence need to be given. At the same time, the profile can be used for any desired length of time.<br>
Favourably such a sequence consists of a first segment and a second segment, in which the first segment yields the base speed and the second segment a drop in the speed of the turntable. As a result, and easily specified profile is obtained with which, nevertheless, the desired cleaning effect can be achieved.<br>
In this case it is favourable to arrange for the first segment to be specified in such a way that during that time less than 300 m, preferably less than 200 meters, and particularly favourably less than 150 m of fibre sliver are transported. If the first segment is specified in this way, then only a small quantities of particles will come loose from the fibre sliver during that time, as a result of which the subsequent drop needs only a low magnitude and duration to provide the necessary cleaning effect.<br>
In order to avoid disturbing the cycloidal pattern of deposition, it is favourable for the second segment to be specified in such a way that less than 5 m, preferably less than 4 m, and particularly preferably less than 3 m of fibre sliver are transported during that segment.<br><br><br>
In a favourable implementation, the drive system features a clutch that can be controlled by the control unit. The controllable clutch is designed for briefly separating the turntable from a driving motor. The speed of the turntable can now easily be lowered by briefly disengaging the clutch. The momentum of the turntable will keep it turning, although with a falling speed. After a specifiable time, or when a specified turntable speed has been reached, the clutch can be engaged again so that the turntable returns to rotation at its base speed.<br>
In another favourable implementation, the drive system incorporates a gearbox with a controllable transmission ratio. The control unit is able to control the transmission ratio. Briefly lowering the speed of the turntable can now be achieved by briefly changing the transmission ratio.<br>
The controllable transmission is favourably a traction gear with a controllable transmission ratio. It can, for instance, comprise a flat belt drive with conical pulleys, or a V-belt drive with a pulley whose effective diameter can be controlled. In order to be able to change the transmission ratio, the flat belt drive has at least one conical pulley, on which the flat belt can be moved axially. The V-belt drive has, for this purpose, a pulley on which the two running surfaces for the V-belt can be axially displaced with respect to one another.<br>
In a further embodiment, the controllable transmission incorporates a differential gear, whose carrier is connected to a brake that can be controlled by the control unit, or to an auxiliary motor controlled by the control unit. The carrier is what holds the wheels that turn in a differential gear. When the turntable is to be driven at its base speed, the carrier is held by means of a brake or by the stationary auxiliary motor, so that the differential gear operates like a stationary transmission. Now in order to lower the speed of the turntable, the brake can be released or the auxiliary motor can be switched on. The carrier will start to rotate in either case, and the speed of the turntable will therefore fall.<br>
In another favourable embodiment, the drive system is a dedicated drive for the turntable. "Dedicated drive" here means a drive that does not have any mechanical coupling to the other driven elements, for instance with the delivery device or the turntable. The dedicated drive favourably comprises an electric motor whose speed can be controlled by the control unit. This can be connected to the turntable through a gear with a fixed transmission ratio.<br>
A device according to the invention can be designed to fill a round can or to fill a rectangular can. In the first case it is favourable if it is designed to impart rotary movement to the sliver can, so that the sliver can executes rotation. In the second case, in contrast, it is favourable if it is constructed to impart an oscillating translation movement to the sliver can. Oscillating translation movement is also referred to<br><br><br>
as traversing movement. Whether the movement consists of rotation or of translation and oscillation, it is a periodic movement, since after a certain time the sliver can is brought back to its original position. The term "original position" here refers both to the position and to the orientation of the sliver can.<br>
A spinning preparation machine according to the invention has at least one device that accords with the invention. The advantages described are obtained.<br>

Figure 1 shows a schematic side view of a drawframe 1 as an example of a spinning preparation machine 1. The fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 in front of the drawframe 1 are passed together in the direction of movement LR over a feed stand 2, an intake roller unit 3, an intake sensor unit 4 and a drafting system 5. The fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 are then combined through a delivery device 6 to form a single compact fibre sliver FB. They are then passed at a defined delivery speed LG to a device 7 with which the fibre sliver FB is deposited into a sliver can K.<br>
The feed stand 2, only shown schematically, incorporates a first feed stand roller 2a arranged in such a way that a first fibre sliver FBI in front of the machine can be<br><br><br>
drawn from a sliver can Kl placed by the drawframe 1, and a second fibre sliver FB2 can be drawn from a sliver can K2 placed in an offset position. A second feed stand roller 2b is included in order to draw a third fibre sliver FB3 from a third sliver can K3 and a fourth fibre sliver FB4 from a fourth sliver can K4. A fifth fibre sliver FB5 and a sixth fibre sliver FB6 are also each drawn by another feed stand roller, not shown here, from a sliver can, also not shown. Altogether the feed stand 2 is designed to supply six fibre slivers simultaneously to the intake roller unit 3. This should, however, merely be understood as an example, as a different number of sliver cans supplying fibre slivers can also be present.<br>
The feed stand 2 can also be designed in such a way that it can accept an incoming fibre sliver directly from a running card, or a number of incoming fibre slivers, each from a running card.<br>
When reference is made below to fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6, this should not be taken to exclude the possibility that only a single fibre sliver, or any other number of fibre slivers is in fact involved.<br>
The incoming fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 are conveyed from the feed stand 2 by sliver conveying equipment (not shown) to the intake roller unit 3. This comprises three intake rollers 3a, 3b, 3ab', which are a first, powered lower intake roller 3a, a second, powered lower intake roller 3b and an idle loading roller 3ab' moving as a result of its contact with the incoming fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6.<br>
From the intake roller 3 the fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 are transported to the intake sensor unit 4 by an intake guide, not shown. This incorporates a pair of sensing rollers 4a, 4a', consisting of a sensing roller 4a on fixed bearings, and a movable sensing roller 4a'. Both the sensing roller 4a on fixed bearings and the sensing roller 4a' on movable bearings can be rotated about their vertical axis, but are shown rotated through 90° for the sake of representing them on the sketch. Both the sensing rollers 4a, 4a' are also powered.<br>
The inlet sensor unit 4 is used to measure, segment by segment, the overall mass per unit length of the fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 passing through it together. The individually measured sections usually have a length of a few millimetres. For every measured segment, the inlet sensor 4 generates a measurement MW. The measured values MW are used in particular to regulate the drawframe 1.<br>
The drafting system 5 comprises a set of intake rollers 5a, 5a' mentioned above, a set of central rollers 5b, 5b' and a set of discharge rollers 5c, 5c', 5c". The lower rollers 5a, 5b, 5c of the roller sets 5a, 5a'; 5b, 5b'; 5c, 5c', 5c"; are driven in such a way that the rotary speed increases from one set of rollers to another in the direction of<br><br><br>
movement LR. As a result of this, the fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 are drawn out, both in the preliminary drawing region 5d that is formed between the set of intake rollers 5a, 5a' and the set of central rollers 5b, 5b', and also in the main drawing region 5e that is formed between the set of central rollers 5b, 5b' and the set of discharge rollers 5c, 5c', 5c".<br>
The positions of the lower rollers 5a, 5b, 5c of the drafting system 5 are fixed. In contrast, the rotating upper rollers 5a', 5b' 5c' and the rotating diversion roller 5c" have bearings that can move transversely in respect of the direction of running LR, and are pressed against the lower rollers 5a, 5b, 5c by a loading mechanism, not shown, in order to permit a firm grip on the fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6. The upper rollers 5a', 5b' 5c' and the rotating diversion roller 5c" are therefore made to rotate by their contact with the fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6 as they pass by.<br>
The delivery unit 6 comprises a funnel 8 and a powered discharge roller 9 on fixed bearings as well as a movable, powered discharge roller 9' that is loaded and thereby pressed against the fixed discharge roller 9. The funnel 8 acts to compress the drawn fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6, so creating a single, compact fibre sliver FB. The discharge rollers 9 and 9' pull the fibre sliver FB out of the measuring funnel 8, and compact the fibre sliver FB that has been made even further. The discharge speed LG is thus determined by the speed at which the discharge rollers 9, 9' rotate.<br>
The device 7 for depositing the fibre sliver FB into a sliver can K comprises a powered discharge roller 9 mounted on fixed bearings as well as a movable, powered discharge roller 9' that is loaded and thereby pressed against the fixed discharge roller 9, a turntable 10 and a sliver duct 11 that can rotate around the axis that is shown with a broken line, and is powered.<br>
The sliver can carrier 12 is constructed so that it can carry and periodically move the sliver can K. For this purpose it has a can table 12' that is also able to rotate about an axis of rotation DR1, illustrated with a broken line, and is powered. The sliver can carrier 12 with a rotating turntable 12' is particularly suitable for a sliver can K with a round cross-section, known as a round can. When a sliver can K is placed as intended on the can table 12', its opening faces the opening of the turntable 10. Because the axis of rotation DR of the turntable 10 and the axis of rotation DR' of the can table 12' are mutually offset, it is possible - if the turntable speed DG is matched to the discharge speed LG - for the fibre sliver FB transported through the sliver duct 11 to be deposited in the sliver can K in loops with a cycloidal arrangement. If the turntable 10 and the can table 12' rotating the same direction, the fibre sliver FB is deposited in an epicycloidal pattern, whereas if they turn an opposite direction, the pattern is hypocycloidal.<br><br><br>
Whenever a sliver can with a rectangular cross-section, known as a rectangular can, has to be filled it is usual to use a sliver can carrier device on a carriage that moves back and forth periodically - this is not illustrated in Figure 1. This gives the rectangular can an oscillating translation movement, as a result of which the sliver is deposited in the usual cycloidal loops.<br>
The drawframe 1 includes a machine controller 13 that controls a primary motor 14. This drives the lower roller 5c of the delivery roller set 5c, 5c', 5c", the discharge roller 9 that is on fixed bearings, the discharge roller 9' on movable bearings, the turntable 10 and the can table 12 through a system of gears that is not illustrated. Those working parts that are directly driven by the primary motor 14 have a ratio of rotation speeds that can be adjusted by means of exchangeable parts, but which is held constant when the drawframe 1 is in operation. Exchangeable parts of this type include, for instance, exchangeable gear wheels, exchangeable pulleys and/or similar devices.<br>
The turntable speed DG is matched to the delivery speed LG at a stage prior to actually depositing the fibre sliver FB into the sliver can K by selecting and fitting the appropriate exchangeable parts in the drive train of the turntable and/or the drive train to the discharge rollers 9, 9'. Modification of this sort prior to operation is carried out, for instance, at a change of batch, when the deposition geometry is changed as a result, for instance, of changing the can size or the geometry of the turntable 10, or when it is determined that the equipment is incorrectly adjusted.<br>
While fibre sliver FB is actually being deposited into the sliver can K, on the other hand, the ratio between the delivery speed and the turntable speed is constant. The characteristic curve is, in other words, straight. The exchangeable parts are chosen here in such a way that with the planned delivery speed LG, the speed of the turntable DG corresponds to a base speed GG, as a result of which the fibre sliver FB is deposited in a cycloidal pattern. This base speed is usually determined in advance through experimental trials.<br>
The primary motor 14 moreover, through a differential gear 15, drives the feed stand rollers 2a, 2b, the lower intake rollers 3a, 3b, the fixed-position sensor roller 4a, the movable sensing roller 4a', the lower roller 5a of the set of intake rollers 5a, 5a' and the lower roller 5b of the set of central rollers 5b, 5b'. Whereas the working parts of the drafting system 1 that are driven by the differential gear 15 also exhibit a constant ratio between their speeds of rotation, it is possible, with the drive arrangement shown, for the speed of rotation of the lower roller 5b in the set of central rollers 5b, 5b' to be adjusted in relation to the speed of rotation of the lower roller 5c in the set of delivery rollers 5c, 5c', 5c". This makes it possible to change the draft and thereby to compensate for variations in the mass per unit length of the supplied fibre slivers FBI, FB2, FB3, FB4, FB5 and FB6. The measurements MW made by the inlet sensor<br><br><br>
unit 4 are transmitted to the machine controller 13 for this purpose. On the basis of the measurements MW, control commands are then transmitted to a servomotor 16 that acts on the differential gear 15 in such a way that the speed of rotation of the working parts situated upstream of the main drawing region HV is modified.<br>
Figure 2 shows a detailed representation of the turntable 10, with the sliver can K in its working position. The turntable 10 comprises a table body 17, a table holder 18, and the curved sliver duct 11. This is attached to the table holder 18 by means of a cast piece 19 at its upper end, while its lower end is attached to the table body 17 through a cast piece 20.<br>
The table body 17 has a pressure surface 21 at its lower end. The clearance AB between the pressure surface 21 and the container 10 is made small enough that the deposited fibre sliver FB cannot overflow from the container 10. In addition, the table body 17 has a groove 17' around its circumference, which is provided for a V-belt, not shown, used to drive the turntable 10.<br>
When the device according to the invention 7 is operating, the fibre sliver FB enters the sliver duct 11 parallel to the axis of rotation DR in the region of the inlet opening 22, where it is diverted, leaving the sliver duct 11 to be deposited in the sliver can K through the outlet opening 23 which is positioned eccentrically in relation to the axis of rotation DR and is located in the plane of the pressure surface 21.<br>
The sliver duct 11 consists of two directly overlapping arcs 24, 25 which occupy different spatial planes.<br>
When the fibre sliver FB is transported through the sliver duct 11, it is unavoidable, particularly at high delivery speed LG and the associated high turntable speed, that some particles come loose from the essentially homogenous fibre sliver FB as a result of the forces acting on the fibre sliver FB. The fibre sliver FB is subjected to strong forces, particularly in the region of the arc 24. Particles that come loose in this way can, for instance, consist of short fibres or of foreign materials.<br>
The loosened particles have a tendency to accumulate on the inner wall of the sliver duct 11, particularly in arc 25 in the region of the outlet opening 23. As the device operates, these accumulations can form particle clumps of considerable size (known as mice). Particle clumps like this come loose from time to time from the inner wall of the sliver duct 11, and can then reach the sliver can K, and this can create problems in further processing of the fibre sliver FB. These accumulated particles can, moreover, damage the deposited fibre sliver FB.<br><br><br>
Attempts to avoid the formation of mice through a modified geometry of the sliver duct 11, or by using low-friction materials for the inner side of the sliver duct 11, have reduced but not overcome this long-standing problem.<br>
Figure 3 shows a view from above of a sliver can K filled with a fibre sliver FB. The cycloidal deposition pattern shown, having a consistent deposition diameter AD, consistent displacement VS and a consistent distance AK of the sliver column BS from the inside of the sliver can K is obtained if the speed of the turntable is that of the intended base speed GG during deposition of the fibre sliver FB.<br>
The rippled deposition pattern shown in Figure 4 is obtained if the speed of the turntable DG is persistently lower than the planned base speed GG during deposition. In addition to the ripple in the fibre sliver FB mentioned above, it is also unhelpful that the sliver column BS lies directly against the inner wall of the sliver can K.<br>
The deposition pattern shown in Figure 5, moreover is obtained if the turntable speed during deposition is greater than the planned base speed GG. Each loop that is deposited here does not have the deposition diameter AD, but has an outward-pointing peak. The displacement between neighbouring loops varies. It can clearly be seen that displacement VS1 is larger than displacement VS2.<br>
The deposition pattern is illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 are undesirable, as they regularly lead to problems when the fibre sliver FB is withdrawn from the sliver can K. Meticulous attention is therefore paid, in practice, to ensuring that the speed of the turntable DG corresponds to the specified base speed GG.<br>
The essence of the present invention is to lower the speed of the turntable DG temporarily in comparison with the specified base speed GG while the fibre sliver FB continues to be deposited in the sliver can K. The present invention is therefore in conscious contrast with the opinion that has until now been dominant, according to which deviation from the base speed GG while the sliver can K is being filled must be avoided at all costs.<br>
The lowering of the speed of the turntable DG is carried out in one embodiment of the invention in accordance with a prespecified speed profile GP, an example of which is illustrated in Figure 6a. The speed profile GP defines the speed of the turntable DG in accordance with the length LFB of fibre sliver FB that has been transported. The speed profile GP comprises a sequence S that is continuously repeated. An initial segment ABl of the sequence S may correspond, for instance, to a length LFB of 200 m. During segment ABl the speed of the turntable corresponds to the planned base speed GG. A second segment AB2 of the sequence S follows the first segment ABl immediately, and corresponds to a length LFB of, for instance, 2 m. It is therefore a great deal shorter than segment ABl. During segment AB2 the speed of<br><br><br>
the turntable is reduced to a lowered speed AG. A percentage drop of, for example, about 3% may be provided.<br>
The example of a speed profile GP shown can, in many cases, generate an adequate cleaning effect in the sliver duct, without causing any change to the cycloidal deposition pattern shown in Figure 3. Depending on the material, the thickness and/or dirt content of the fibre sliver FB, and also depending on the geometry of the device 7, it is however also possible to specify other modified speed profiles GP. The profile GP optimum for any individual case can be determined empirically by means of appropriate tests. A relatively small number of speed profiles GP are sufficient to cover the constellations that realistically occur.<br>
Figure 6b illustrates an example of a drive interruption profile AP. The drive interruption profile AP specifies whether the drive system 26 acts on the turntable or whether its action is interrupted in relation to the length LFB of transported fibre sliver FB. When the drive interruption profile AP adopts a value of 1, this means that the drive system 26 drives the turntable 10 with the planned base speed GG. If, however, the drive interruption profile AP adopts a value of 0, the drive is interrupted. The turntable speed DG will then fall, as a result of frictional losses, below the planned base speed GG, so that the speed of the turntable DG temporarily falls. The drive interruption profile also comprises a repeating sequence S, itself consisting of segments AB1 and AB2.<br>
Figure 7 shows a device according to the invention, as well at its interaction with the machine controller 13, the primary motor 14 of the spinning preparation machine, and the delivery unit 6. A drive system 26 is here associated with the turntable 10, and this permits a temporary reduction in the turntable speed DG in relation to the specified base speed GG, in accordance with a prespecified speed profile GP, while deposition of the fibre sliver FB into the sliver can K continues. It incorporates an electronic control unit 27 in order to control the speed of the turntable DG automatically. The control unit 27 incorporates a memory unit 28 in which a large number of speed profiles GP are stored. At any one time, one of the stored speed profiles is read and activated, either manually or automatically, while the fibre sliver FB is deposited.<br>
The drive to the turntable 10 is supplied by means of the primary motor 14 of the spinning preparation machine 1. It is connected to the turntable 10 by means of a clutch 29 and through selectable linkages that are not illustrated. The selectable linkages are fitted in such a way that when the clutch 29 is closed the turntable 10 is driven at the planned base speed GG. A drop in the speed of the turntable DG in association with the activated speed profile GP is now created by opening the clutch 29 in response to a control command from the control unit 27. After a defined time has elapsed, after a defined length of fibre sliver FB has been transported, or when the<br><br><br>
turntable speed DG has dropped to a particular, prespecified value, the clutch 29 is closed in response to a new control command from the control unit 27. This procedure is continuously and periodically repeated.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a further possible embodiment of a device 7 according to the invention. The turntable 10 is again driven by the primary motor 14, but in this case through the gearbox 30 that has a controllable transmission ratio. The controllable gearbox 30 comprises a traction gear 31 that permits the transmission ratio to be changed. It incorporates a pulley 32 with running surfaces for a V-belt whose relative axial distance can be changed. This makes it possible to change the radius with which the V-belt encircles the belt pulley 32. The device 7 is designed in such a way that the relative axial movement can be controlled by the control unit 27.<br>
Figure 9 shows a modification of the device shown in Figure 8. The controllable traction gear here is replaced by a differential gear 33. Its power-in side is connected to the primary motor 14, its power-out side to the turntable 10, and its carrier 34 to an auxiliary motor 35 whose speed can be controlled by the control unit 27. The carrier 34 supports the revolving wheels of the differential gear 33. When movement of the carrier 34 is prevented, the differential gear 34 operates like a stationary transmission. Linkages, not shown, between the primary motor 14 and the turntable 10 are selected in such a way that when the carrier 34 is stationary, the speed of the turntable DG corresponds to the base speed GG. In order, now, to lower the speed of the turntable DG, the control unit 27 causes the auxiliary motor 35 to begin moving. This will cause the carrier 34 to begin rotating in such a way that the speed of the turntable DG is lowered.<br>
As an alternative, the auxiliary motor 35 can be replaced by a controllable brake to hold the carrier 34 in place. The speed of the turntable DG can then be lowered simply by releasing the brake.<br>
Figure 10 shows a further device according to the invention, in which the drive system 26 is implemented as a dedicated drive. While the delivery unit 6 and the turntable 12' continue to be driven by the primary motor 14, a mechanically independent drive is provided for the turntable 10, comprising a controllable electric motor 36 that is connected to the turntable 10 through a gearbox 37 with a fixed transmission ratio. The electric motor 36 is controlled by the control unit 27.<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the example embodiments illustrated and described. Modifications within the scope of the patent claims are possible at any time.<br><br><br>
