COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1.NEW CARBOXYLIC ACID AMIDE DERIVATIVES WHICH ARE ANTAGONISTS OF NMDA RECEPTOR OR ARE INTERMEDIATES FOR PREPARING THEREOF.<br>

(A)	RICHTER GEDEON VEGYESZETI GYAR RT.<br>
(B)	Gyomroi ut 19-21, H-1103 Budapest Hungary<br>
(C)	HUNGARY<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
I     The invention relates to new carboxylic acid amide derivatives which are antagonists of NMDA receptor or are intermediates for preparing thereof. Background of the invention.<br>
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated cation-channels embedded in the cell membranes of neurons. Overactivation of NMDA receptors by glutamate, their natural ligand, can lead to calcium overload of cells. This triggers a cascade of intracellular events that alters the cell function and ultimately may lead to death of neurons [TINS, 10, 299-302 (1987)]. Antagonists of the NMDA receptors may be used for treating many disorders that are accompanied with excess release of glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.<br>
The knowledge on the NMDA receptor structure, function and pharmacology has expanded owing to recent achievements of the molecular biology. The NMDA receptors are heteromeric assemblies built up from at least one NR1 subunit and at least one of the four different  NR2   subunits   (NR2A-D).   Both   spatial   distributions   in   the   CNS   and   the pharmacological sensitivity of NMDA receptors built up from various NR2 subunits are different. Particularly interesting of these is the NR2B subunit due to its restricted distribution (highest densities in the forebrain and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord). Compounds selective for this subtype are available [Curr. Pharm. Des., 5, 381-404 (1999)] and have been proved to be effective in animal models of stroke [Stroke, 28,2244-2251 (1997)], traumatic brain injury [Brain Res., 792, 291-298 (1998)], Parkinson's disease [Exp. Neurol., 163, 239-243 (2000)], neuropathic and inflammatory pain  [Neuropharmacology, 38, 611-623  (1999)]. Moreover, NR2B subtype selective antagonists of NMDA receptors are expected to possess little or no untoward side effects that are typically caused by the non-selective antagonists of NMDA receptors, namely psychotomimetic effects such as dizziness, headache, hallucinations, dysphoria and disturbances of cognitive and motor function.<br>
NR2B subtype selective NMDA antagonism can be achieved with compounds that specifically bind to, and act on, an allosteric modulatory site of the NR2B subunit containing receptors. This binding site can be characterised by displacement (binding) studies with specific radioligands, such as [125I]-ifenprodil [J.Neurochem., 61, 120-126 (1993)] or [3H]-Ro 25,6981 [J.<br><br>
Neurochem., 70, 2147-2155 (1998)]. Since ifenprodil was the first, though not sufficiently specific, known ligand of this receptor, it has also been termed ifenprodil binding site.<br>
Close stucture analogs of the carboxylic acid amide derivatives of formula (I) are known from the literature.<br>
The Florida Center for Heterocyclic Compounds [Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, P 0 Box 117200, Gainesville, FL, 32611-7200, USA] provides milligram quantities of three compounds of formula (I) for biological testing: N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-(phenylmethyl)-l-piperidineacetamide, 4-[[oxo[4-(phenylmethyl)-l-piperidinyl]acetyl]amino]benzoic acid and 4-[[oxo[4-(phenylmethyl)-l-piperidinyl]acetyl]amino]benzoic acid ethyl ester.<br>
Oxo-ethylamino derivatives are described as intermediates for thrombin inhibitors [Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letters, 9, 925. (1999)]. The publication does not describe NMDA receptor antagonist effect..<br>
N-(4-Benzoylphenyl)-4-(phenylrnethyl)-l-piperidineacetarnide is mentioned in patent No. US 6,048,900 as selective neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist.<br>
N-(2-Formyl-6-methylphenyl)-4-(phenylmethyl-l-piperidineacetamide is described in patent No. AU 639529 as intermediate for carbostyril derivative which is useful as antiarrhythmics.<br>
Aminoacetarylides are also known [Rev. Chim. (Bucharest), 33(7). 601. (1982); CA 97:174467a] as local anesthetic and antifibrillatory agents.<br>
Piperidine derivatives and analogues substituted with phenols or phenol equivalents having NR2B selective NMDA antagonist activity are described in international patent applications WO90/14087, WO90/14088, WO97/23202, W097/23214, W097/23215, W097/23216, W097/23458, W099/21539, WO2000/25109, EP648.744 and in US 5,436,255. Compounds containing 2-benzoxazolinone substructure with the same biological activity are described in international patent applications W098/18793 and WO2000/00197. Other NR2B selective NMDA antagonists having condensed heterocyclic structures are described in WO2001/30330, WO2001/32171, WO2001/32174, WO2001/32177, WO2001/32179, WO2001/32615, WO2001/32634.<br>
However, there continues to be a need for novel NMDA antagonists that target the NR2B receptor. Summary of the invention<br><br>
Surprisingly it was found that the new carboxylic acid amide derivatives of formula (I) of the present invention are functional antagonists of NMDA receptors, which target the NMDA receptors primarily via binding to the ifenprodil binding site. Therefore, they are believed to be NR2B subtype specific antagonists. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates therefore first to new carboxylic acid amide derivatives of formula (I)<br><br><br>

and the obtained compounds of formula (I) - where R1, R2, Y, Z, U, V, X, W, n and m are as defined above - in given case are transformed into an other compound of formula (1) by introducing further substituents and/or modifying and/or removing the existing ones, and/or formation of salts with acids and/or liberating the carboxylic acid amide derivative of formula (I) from the obtained acid addition salts by treatment with a base and/or the free carboxylic acid amide derivative of formula (I) can be transformed into a salt by treatment with a base and/or are resolved into their optical antipodes.<br>
The amide bond formation is preferably carried out by preparing an active derivative from a carboxylic acid of formula (II) or (TV) which is reacted with an amine of formula (HI) or (V) preferably in the presence of a base.<br>
The transformation of a carboxylic acid into an active derivative can be carried out in situ during the amide bond formation in a proper solvent (for example dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, chlorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons). The active derivatives can be acid chlorides (for example prepared from carboxylic acid with tbionyl chloride), mixed anhydrides<br><br>
(for example prepared from carboxylic acid with isobutyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine), active esters (for example prepared from carboxylic acid with hydroxybenztriazol and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide or 0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) in the presence of a base e.g. triethylamine), acid azides (for example prepared from carboxylic acid hydrazide). The active derivatives can be prepared between room temperature and 0 °C. A proper amine of formula (HI) or (V) is added as base or as a salt formed with inorganic acid to the so obtained solution or suspension in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine, needed for the liberation of the amine. The condensation reactions are followed by thin layer chromatography. The necessary reaction time is 6-20 h. The work-up of the reaction mixture can be carried out by different methods.<br>
The amide bond formation is preferably carried out by refluxing in a proper solvent an amine of formula (HI) or (V) with a halogen compound of formula (TV) or (VH) in the presence of an organic base (for example triethylamine, pyridine, piperidine) or an inorganic base (for example sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate) and sodium iodide. The proper solvent can be an aprotic solvent (for example toluene, chlorinated hydrocarbons) or a dipolar aprotic solvent (for example keton, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide). The reactions are followed by thin layer chromatography. The necessary reaction time is 20-50 h. The work-up of the reaction mixture also can be carried out by different methods.<br>
When the reaction mixture is a suspension, the precipitate is filtered off, washed with water and/or with an organic solvent and recrystallized from a proper solvent to give the pure product. If the crystallization does not lead to the pure product, then column chromatography can be used for the purification of it The column chromatography is carried out on normal phase using Kieselgel 60 as adsorbent and different solvent systems, e.g. toluene/methanol, chloroforni/methanol or toluene/acetone, as eluents. If the reaction mixture is a solution at the end of the acylation or alkylation, it is concentrated, and the residue is crystallized or purified by column chromatography as described above. The structure of the products are determined by IR, NMR and mass spectrometry.<br>
The obtained carboxylic acid amide derivatives of formula (I) - independently from the method of preparation - in given case can be transformed into an other compound of formula (I) by introducing further substituents and/or modifying and/Or removing the existing ones, and/or formation of salts with acids and/or liberating the carboxylic acid amide derivative of formula (I)<br><br>
from the obtained acid addition salts by treatment with a base and/or the free carboxylic acid amide derivative of formula (I) can be transformed into a salt by treatment with a base.<br>
For example cleaving the methyl and benzyl groups from methoxy and benzyloxy groups, winch stands for U,V and Z, leads to phenol derivatives. The removal of the benzyl group can be carried out for example with catalytic hydrogenation or with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid solution,  the  cleavage  of methyl  group  can  be  carried  out with  boron  tribromide   in dichloromethane solution. The compounds of formula (1) containing free phenolic hydroxy group can be transformed into acyloxy or sulfoxy derivatives with different acylating or sulfonylating agents. The reactions are carried out at room temperature in chlorinated hydrocarbons using acid chloride or acid anhydride as acylating agent in the presence of a base (for example triethylamine or sodium carbonate). The carboxylic acid amide derivatives of formula (I) containing a nitro group (I) can be transformed into amines by catalytic hydrogenation and the amines can be further reacted to give acid amides as described for the acylation of phenolic hydroxy groups. Free hydroxy group's can be esterified by acid anhydrides or acid halogenides in the presence of a base.<br>
The carboxylic acids of formula (H) or (TV), the primary or secondary amines of formula (III) or (V) and the halogene compounds of formula (VI) or (VU) are either commercially available or can be synthesized by different known methods. The syntheses of some commercially not available carboxylic acids of formula (IT) or (IV) or halogen compounds of (VI) or (VII) are described in the Examples. Following these procedures the other commercially not available carboxylic acids of formula (II) or (TV) or halogen compounds of formula (VI) or (VII) can also be prepared. Experimental protocols<br>
Assessing the functional NMDA antagonist potency of compounds in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons based on measuring the intracellular calcium concentration using a fluorimeter plate reader<br>
It is known that during postnatal development the subunit composition of neuronal NMDA receptors is changing. Similar change has been detected in neuronal cell cultures [Eur. J. Neurosci., 10, 1704-1715 (1998)]. According to data in the literature and to our own immunocytochemical examinations neuronal cells cultured for 4-7 days in vitro predominantly express the NR2B subunit, together with NR1 subunit. Therefore, functional test of NMDA antagonism in these cells reflects mainly an action on NR2B subunit containing receptors. Since<br><br>
NMDA receptors are known to be permeable to calcium ions upon excitation, the extent of NMDA receptor activation, and its inhibition by functional antagonists can be characterised by measuring the rise in the intracellular' calcium concentration following agonist (NMDA) application onto the cells. Since there is very high sequence homology between rat and human NMDA receptors (99, 95, 97 % for NRl, NR2A, andNR2B subunits, respectively), it is believed that there is little, if any, difference in their pharmacological sensitivity. Hence, results obtained with (cloned or native) rat NMDA receptors may be well extrapolated to the human ones.<br>
The intracellular calcium measurements are carried out on primary neocoru'cal cell cultures derived from 17 day old Charles River rat embryos [for the details on the preparation of neocortical cell culture see Johnson, M.I.; Bunge, R.P. (1992): Primary cell cultures of peripheral and central neurons and glia. In: Protocols for Neural Cell Culture, eds: Fedoroff, S.; Richardson A., The Humana Press Inc., 13-38.] After isolation, the cells are plated onto standard 96-well microplates and the cultures are maintained in an atmosphere of 95 % air-5 % CO2 at 37 °C until testing.<br>
The cultures are used for the intracellular calcium measurements after 4-7 days in vitro. The cells are loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fluo-4/AM (2-2.5 uM) prior to testing. Loading is stopped by washing twice with the solution used also during the measurement (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazmeethane-sulfonic acid], 5 mM HEPES-Na, 20 mM glucose, 10 uM glycine, pH=7.4). Then the test compound dissolved in the above solution (90 ul/well) is added. Intracellular calcium measurements are carried out with a plate reader fluorimeter. A rise is induced by application of 40 uM NMDA in Fluo-4-fluorescence that reflects the intracellular calcium concentration. Inhibitory potency of the test compound is assessed by measuring the reduction in the calcium elevation in the presence of different concentrations of the compound. After the measurement, a standard calibration procedure [Meth. Cell. Biol., 40, 155-181 (1994)] is applied to convert the fluorescence data to calcium concentration values.<br>
Inhibitory potency of a compound at a single concentration point is expressed as percent<br>
'inhibition of the control NMDA response. Sigmoidal concentration-inhibition curves are fitted<br>
over the data and IC50 values are defined as the concentration that produces half of the maximal<br>
inhibition that could be achieved with the compound. Mean IC50 values are derived from at least<br>
three independent experiments.	,  ,<br>

Mouse formalin test for measurement in vivo efficacy<br>
Injection of diluted formalin into the hind paw of rats or mouse is known to elicit a biphasic pain related behaviour measured as time spent by licking/biting of the injured paw. The second phase is generally defined as pain related events detected in the 15-60 min. time interval after formalin injection. It is known that NMDA receptors are involved in the second phase of response to formalin injection and this behavioural response is sensitive to blockade of NMDA receptors [Dickenson, A. and Besson Ji-M. (Editors): Chapter 1, pp. 6-7: Animal models of Analgesia; and Chapter 8, pp. 180-183: Mechanism of Central Hypersensitivity: Excitatory Amino Acid Mechanisms and Their Control - In Pharmacology of Pain. Springer-Verlag (Berlin) 1997.] Therefore, we used the second phase of formalin test to characterise the efficacy of compounds in vivo. Inhibition of the second phase of response is considered to indicate an analgesic effect against chemically-induced persistent pain [Hunskaar, S., et al.: Formalin Test in Mice, a Useful Technique for Evaluating Mild Analgesics, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 14 (1985)69-76.]<br>
Male albino Charles River NMRI mice (20-25 g) were used. Prior to the experiment any solid food was withdrawn for 16 hours but the animals had free access to 20 % glucose solution. The animals were allowed a 1 hour acclimatisation period spent in a glass cylinder (cc. 15 cm in<br><br>
The method is essentially similar to that described by Mutel et al. [J. Neurochem., 70, 2147-2155 (1998)] except for incubation temperature and radioligand concentration. Briefly, membranes are isolated from the forebrain of male Wistar rats. They are incubated in the presence and absence of test compound for 2 h at room temperature. Non-specific binding is determined using 10 uM Ro-25,6981, and is typically less than 7% of the total binding. The applied radioligand (3H-Ro-25,6981) concentration is 4 nM. IC50 values (50 % inhibitory concentrations) axe determined from sigmoidal fits plotted over concentration-displacement curves. The biological activity of the compounds<br>
IC50 values for selected examples of compounds of this invention in the functional NMDA antagonism and in the binding tests are listed in Table 1 and compared to those determined for the most potent known reference compounds.<br>
The compounds of this invention exhibit IC50 values of less than 50 uM in the functional NMDA antagonism and in the binding tests. Thus the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are NR2B subtype specific NMDA antagonists. Some of the compounds have superior potency compared to the known reference compounds (see Table 1).<br>

The test substances were suspended in 5 % tween-80 (10 ml per kg body weight), and administered orally by gavage 15 min before the formalin injection (20 ul of 1 % formalin in 0.9 % saline injected subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the right hindpaw). The time spent by licking and biting of the injected paw was measured from 20 to 25 min. after the formalin injection. For the determination of ED50 value, various doses (at least five) of the test substances were given to groups of 5 mice and the results expressed as % inhibition time spent by licking relative to a vehicle control group observed on the same day.

Disorders which may be beneficially treated with NMDA antagonists include traumatic injury of brain [Neurol. Res., 21,330-338 (1999)] or spinal cord (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 175, 165-74 (1990)], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related neuronal injury [Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol, 1998; 38159-77], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [Neurol.

Res., 731, 171-181 (1996)], withdrawal syndromes of e.g. alcohol, opioids or cocaine [Drug and Alcohol Depend., 59, 1-15<br><br>
/ (2000)], muscular spasm [Neurosci. Lett., 73, 143-148 (1987)], dementia of various origins [Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 9,1397-406 (2000)]. An NMDA antagonist may also be useful to treat cerebral ischemia of any origin (e.g. stroke, heart surgery), chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, pain (e.g. posttraumatic or postoperative) and chronic pain states, such as neuropathic pain or cancer related pain, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, migraine, psychosis, hypoglycemia, degenerative disorders of the retina (e.g. CMV retinitis), glaucoma, asthma, tinnitus, aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss prug News Perspect JJ, 523-569 (1998) and WO 00/00197 international patent application].<br>
Accordingly, effective amounts of the compounds of the invention may be beneficially used for the treatment of traumatic: injury of brain or spinal cord, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related neuronal injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tolerance and/or dependence to opioid treatment of pain, withdrawal syndromes of e.g. alcohol, opioids or cocaine, ischemic CNS disorders, chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, pain and chronic pain states, such as neuropathic pain or cancer related pain, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, migraine, psychosis, muscular spasm, dementia of various origin, hypoglycemia, degenerative disorders of the retina, glaucoma, asthma, tinnitus, aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss.<br>
The compounds of the invention as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as such or suitably in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions (drugs) can be in solid, liquid or semiliquid form and pharmaceutical adjuvant and auxiliary materials can be added, which are commonly used in practice, such as carriers, excipients, diluents, stabilizers, wetting or emulsifying agents, pH- and osmotic pressure-influencing, flavoring or aromatizing, as well as formulation-promoting or formulation-providing additives.<br>
The dosage required to exert the therapeutical effect can vary within wide limits and will be fitted to the individual requirements in each of the particular cases, depending on the stage of the disease, the condition and the bodyweight of the patient to be treated, as well as the sensitivity of the patient against the active ingredient, route of administration and number of daily treatments. The actual dose of the active ingredient to be used can safely be determined by the attending physician skilled in the art in the knowledge of the patient to be treated.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient according to the present invention usually contain 0.01 to 100 mg of active ingredient in a single dosage unit. It is,<br><br>
of course possible that the amount of the active ingredient in some compositions exceeds the upper or lower limits defined above.<br>
The solid forms of the pharmaceutical compositions can be for example tablets, dragdes, capsules, pills or iyophilized powder ampoules useful for the preparation of injections. Liquid compositions are the injectable and infusable compositions, fluid medicines, packing fluids and drops. Semiliquid compositions can be ointments, balsams, creams, shaking mixtures and suppositories.<br>
For the sake of a simple administration it is suitable if the pharmaceutical compositions comprise dosage units containing the amount of the active ingredient to be administered once, or a few multiples or a half, third or fourth part thereof. Such dosage units are e.g. tablets, which can be powdered with grooves promoting the halving or quartering of the tablet in order to exactly administer the required amount of the active ingredient.<br>
Tablets can be coated with an acid-soluble layer in order to assure the release of the active ingredient content after leaving the stomach. Such tablets are enteric-coated. A similar effect can be achieved also by encapsulating the active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for oral adrnimstration can contain e.g. lactose or starch as excipients, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidine or starch paste as binders or granulating agents. Potato starch or microcrystalline cellulose, is added as disintegration agents, but ultraamylopectin or formaldehyde casein can also be used. Talcum, colloidic silicic acid,, stearin, calcium or magnesium stearate can be used as antiadhesive and lubricants.<br>
The tablet can be manufactured for example by wet granulation, followed by pressing. The mixed active ingredients and excipients, as well as in given case part of the disintegrants are granulated with an aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous alcoholic solution of the binders in an appropriate equipment, then the granulate is dried. The other disintegrants, lubricants and antiadhesive agents are added to the dried granulate, and the mixture is pressed to a tablet. In given case the tablets are made with halving groove to ease the administration.<br>
The tablets can be made directly from the mixture of the active ingredient and the proper auxiliaries by pressing. In given case, the tablets can be coated by using additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical practice, for example stabilizers, flavoring, coloring agents, such as sugar, cellulose derivatives (methyl- or ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, etc), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, food coloring agents, food laces,<br><br>
aroma agents, iron oxide pigments, etc. In the case of capsules the mixture of the active ingredient and the auxiliaries is filled into capsules.<br>
Liquid oral compositions, for example suspensions, syrups, elixirs can be made by using water, glycols, oils, alcohols, coloring and flavoring agents.<br>
For rectal administration the composition is formulated in suppositories or clysters. The suppository can contain beside the active ingredient a carrier, so called adeps pro suppository. Carriers can be vegetable oils, such as hydrogenated vegetable oils, triglycerides of C12-C18 fatty acids (preferably the carriers under the trade name Witepsol). The active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with the melted adeps pro suppository and the suppositories are moulded. For parenteral administration the composition is formulated as injection solution. For manufacturing the injection solution the active ingredients are dissolved in distilled water and/or in different organic solvents, such as glycolethers, in given case in the presence of solubilizers, for example polioxyethylensorbitane-monolaurate, -monooleate, or monostearate (Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80). The injection solution can also contain different auxiliaries, such as conserving agents, for example ethylendiamine tetraacetate, as well as pH adjusting agents and buffers and in given case local anaesthetic, e.g. lidocain. The injection solution containing the active ingredient of the invention is filtered before it is filled into ampoules, and it is sterilized after filling.<br>
If the active ingredient is hygroscopic, then it can be stabilized by liophylization. The following examples illustrate the invention without the intention of limitation anyway.<br><br>

Example 250 Characterization and Purification Methods<br>
Compounds of the present invention were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass selective detector (LC/MS) using HP 1100 Binary Gradient chromatography system with Microplate Sampler (Agilent, Waldbronn), controlled by ChemStation software. HP diode array detector was used to acquire UV spectra at 225 and 240 nm. All experiments were performed using HP MSD (Agilent, Waldbronn) single quadruple spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionisation source to determine the structure.<br>
The synthesized products were dissolved in 1 ml DMSO (Aldrich, Germany). 100 ul of each solution was diluted with DMSO to 1000 ul volume. Analytical chromatographic experiments were performed on Discovery RP C-16 Amide, 5 cm X 4.6 mm X 5 urn column from Supelco (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) with a flow rate of 1 ml/minute for qualification. The obtained compounds were characterized by their k' value (purity, capacity factor), k1 factors are evaluated by the following formula;<br>
k' = (tR-t0)/to where k'= capacity factor, tR = retention time and to = eluent retention time.<br>
The A eluent was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma, Germany), the B eluent was 95% acetonitrile (Merck, Germany) containing 0.1% TFA and 5% A eluent. Gradient elution was used, starting with 100% A eluent and processing to 100% B eluent over a period of 5 minutes.<br>
Sernipreparative separation of the compounds of the present invention - purity below 85% - was carried out using the same high performance chromatography system. The separation was performed on Discovery RP C-16 Amide, 20 cm X 10 mm X 5 um sernipreparative column from Supelco (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) with a flow rate of 3 ml/rninutes. The fraction collection was based on mass selective separation. Gradient elution was used, starting with 80% A eluent and processing to 65% B eluent over a period of 35 minutes for those compounds where the capacity factor was more than 2.5. The gradient elution was changed, starting with 100 % A<br><br>
eluent and processing to 55% B eluent in 30 minutes for those compounds where the capacity factor was less than 2.5. The collected fractions were qualified by the above detailed analytical method and the solvent was evaporated by Speed Vac (Savant, USA).<br>
