Simultaneous Stimulation for Low Poiver Consumption<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to electrical nerve stimulation, and more particularly, electrostimulation of the nerve based on channel specific sampling<br>
sequences.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Cochlear implants (inner-ear prostheses) are a possibility to help profoundly deaf or severely hearing impaired persons. Unlike conventional hearing aids, which just apply an amplified and modified sound signal, a cochlear implant is based on direct electrical stimulation of the acoustic nerve. The intention of a cochlear implant is to electrically stimulate neural structures in the inner ear in such a way that a hearing sensation most similar to normal hearing is obtained.<br>
[0003] Fig. 1 shows a conventional cochlear prosthesis. The cochlear prosthesis essentially consists of two parts, the speech processor 101 that is typically positioned externally proximate the ear, and the implanted stimulator 105. The speech processor 101 includes the power supply (batteries) of the overall system and is used to perform signal processing of the acoustic signal to extract the stimulation parameter. The stimulator 105 generates the stimuulation patterns and conducts them to the nerve tissue by means of an electrode array 107 that extends into the scala tympani 109 in the inner ear. The connection between speech processor and stimulator is established either by means of a radio frequency link (transcutaneous) using primary coils 103 and secondary coils within stimulator 105, or by means of a plug in the skin (percutaneous).<br>
[0004] One successful stimulation strategy is the so called "continuous-interleaved-sampling strategy" (CIS), as described by Wilson B. S., Finley C. C, Lawson D. T,, Wolford R, D., Eddington D. K,, Rabinowitz W. M,, "Better speech recognition with cochlear implants," Nature, vol. 352,236 - 238 (July 1991) [hereinafter Wilson et al.,<br><br>
1991 ], which is incorporated herem by reference.  Signal processing for CIS in the speech processor involves the following steps:<br>
a.	splitting up of the audio frequency range into spectral bands by means of a<br>
filter bank,<br>
b.	envelope detection of each filter output signal, and<br>
c.	instantaneous nonlinear compression of the envelope signal (map law).<br>
[0005] According to the tonotopic organization of the cochlea, each stimulation electrode in the scala tympani is associated with a band pass filter of the external filter bank. For stimulation, symmetrical biphasic current pulses are applied. The amplitudes of the stimulation pulses are directly obtained from the compressed envelope signals (step (c) of above). These signals are sampled sequentially, and the stimulation pulses are applied in a strictly non-overlapping sequence. Thus, as a typical CIS-feature, only one stimulation channel is active at one time. The overall stimulation rate is comparatively high. For example, assuming an overall stimulation rate of 18kpps, and using a 12-channel filter bank, the stimulation rate per channel is 1.5kpps. Such a stimulation rate per channel usually is sufficient for adequate temporal representation of the envelope signal.<br>
[0006] The maximum overall stimulation rate is limited by the minimum phase duration per pulse. The phase duration cannot be chosen arbitrarily short, because the shorter the pulses, the higher the current amplitudes have to be to elicit action potentials in neurons, and current amplitudes are limited for various practical reasons. For an overall stimulation rate of ISkpps, the phase duration is 2Î¼s, which is at the lower limit.<br>
[0007] Each output of the CIS band pass filters can roughly be regarded as a sinusoid at the center frequency of the band pass filter, which is modulated by the envelope signal. This is due to the quality factor Q = 3 of the filters. In case of a voiced speech segment, this envelope is approximately periodic, and the repetition rate is equal to the pitch frequency.<br>
[0008] In the current CIS-strategy, the envelope signals only are used for further processing, i.e., they contain the entire stimulation information. For each channel, the envelope is represented as a sequence of biphasic pulses at constant repetition rate. As a characteristic feature of CIS, this repetition rate (typically l.5kpps) is equal for all<br><br>
channels, and there is no relation to the center frequencies of the individual channels. It is intended that the repetition rate is not a temporal cue for the patient, i.e., it should be sufficiently high, so that the patient does not perceive tones with a frequency equal to the repetition rate. The repetition rate is usually set to more than twice the bandwidth of the envelope signals (Nyquist theorem).<br>
[0009] Electrode configuration of a 12-channel cochlear implant using monopolar<br>
stimulation<br>
[0010] Figure 2 shows an example of an electrode configuration used in a 12-channel cochlear implant as described m U.S. Patent No. 6,600,955. An electrode array containing 12 electrode contacts 201 (black dots) is positioned within the scala tympani of the cochlea. Bach of these electrodes 201 is connected to a capacitor C 203 and a pair of current sources 205 and 207, whereby the second ports of current sources 205 and 207 are connected to implant ground GND 209 and implant supply voltage Vcc 211, respectively. Current sources 205 and 207 may be fanplemented, for example, using P-channel and N-channel MOS field effect transistor, respectively. Thus, for convenience, the sources 205 and 207 are designated as P-sources and N-sources. Reference electrode 213 is positioned outside the cochlea and connected to a pair of switches 215 and 217, whereby the second ports of switches 215 and 217 are connected to implant ground GND and implant supply voltage Vcc, respectively.<br>
[0011] A simplified lumped-element model of this configuration is shown in Fig. 3. Impedances Z1 301 represent the interface impedances between the metal surfaces of the intra-cochlear electrode contacts and the fluid within the scala tympani. Impedance ZI,REF 303 represents the interface impedance of the reference electrode. The intra-cochlear fluid is represented by the ohmic resistors Rs 305. Since the cross-sectional area is changing along the scala tympani, usually a variable Rs is assumed, as described in Krai A., Hartmann R., Mortazavi D., and Klinke R,, "Spatial Resolution of Cochlear Implants; The Electrical Field and Excitation of Auditory Afferents," Hearing Research 121, pp. 11-28, 1998, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Resistors RB 307 describe the bony structures in which the cochlea is embedded, and they are also position-dependent. The spatial dependencies are of minor importance and therefore, for convenience, Rs and RB are assumed to be constant. Resides, an infinite ladder network<br><br>
RS/RB is assumed. The stimulation current passes the highly resistive structures on its way to the reference electrode.<br>
[0012] Impedances Z1 and ZI,REF in general are complex and frequency-dependent However, in-vitro measurements of the impedances show that for the electrode geometries and the very short pulsatile stimulation waveforms used in cochlear implant applications, the interface impedances can be assumed to be purely ohmic.<br>
[0013] As described in U.S. Patent No, 6,600,955, a stimulation configuration as shown in Fig. 3 may be used to generate either (a) single non-simultaneous stimulation pulses, or (b) simultaneous pulses which are "sign-correlated". For example, the two phases of a single symmetric, biphasic pulse m one electrode are produced by first activating one of the P-sources 313 associated to this electrode and closing switch 315, and then activating the associated N-source 311 and closing switch 317. In the first phase of this pulse, the current is flowmg from the pair of associated current sources via the ladder network to the pair of switches, and in the second phase the current direction is reversed. If current amplitudes and phase durations of the two phases are equal, the pulse is charge balanced, that is, no net charge is delivered to the ladder network.<br>
[0014] If more than one stimulation pulses are applied simultaneously, such pulses arc subject to "sign-correlation", i.e., either several P-sources are activated simultaneously and switch 315 is closed, or several N-sources are activated simultaneously and switch 317 is closed, but no mixture between activated P- and N-sources occurs. This ensures that the sum of currents is always flowing through the reference electrode (i.e., impedance ZI,RBF)- Such a stimulation arrangement is designated as "distributed monopolar".<br>
[0015] The electrical potentials which occur, for example, diu-ing the first phase of a single biphasic pulse are explained with the help of Fig. 4. Let P-source 401 produce a particular amplitude I? causing a voltage drop Up (note that the associated N-source 403 is inactive in this phase). Assuming capacitor 405 as being uncharged prior to the pulse, current Ip will cause a voltage Uc across capacitor 405, which is linearly increasing with time. However, assuming a sufficiently high capacitance, only a comparatively small voltage will drop across capacitor 405 the end of the first pulse phase. Typically, Uc is<br><br>
not larger than some tens of millivolts, and thus is usually is negligible as compared to other voltage drops in the ohmic network. Literface impedance Z\ causes a considerable voltage drop Ui = Zilp. Current Ip is distributed within the infinite ladder network composed of horizontal resistors Rs and vertical resistors RB. The distribution of voltage<br><br><br>
is absorbed by interface impedance Zi, i.e., Pi == Uilp = 3.2mW, and this power does not contribute to the stimulation itself. Thus, any reduction of voltage drop UI is desirable with respect to both the reduction of the implant supply voltage and the reduction of the stimulation power consumption.<br>
[0019] One approach for reducing the voltage drop across ZI is to try to reduce ZI itself. For example, using larger electrode surfaces would reduce ZI. However, the size of the electrode surfaces typically cannot be increased further, because geometrical limits such as electrode distances have ah-eady been reached. Another approach is based on the observation that ZI is not stable over time, but mcreasing in the weeks after the implantation. The reasoning is that the growth of a particular tissue covers Ihe electrode surfaces. Giving corticoids during surgery seems to reduce this additional tissue growth and keep the impedance at least at its initial value.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0020] In a first aspect of the invention, a method is provided for simultaneously activating electrodes in a multi-channel electrode array having a monopolar electrode configuration. The method includes determining a desired potential for a given position relative to the electrode array. Amplitudes of simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses associated with at least two electrodes of the multi-channel array are determined so as to provide a total potential at the given position that is substantially equal to the desired potential. The at least two electrodes are simultaneously activated as a function of the determined amplitudes to achieve the desired potential at the given position, wherein the at least two electrodes have spatial channel interaction when activated.<br>
[0021] In accordance with related embodiments of the invention, determining amplitudes may include adding a resulting potential from each of the sign-correlated pulses at the given position. Each of the determined amplitudes may be less than the amplitude needed to activate an electrode in the multi-channel electrode array using a continuous-interleaved-sampling strategy to achieve the desired potential. The power required to activate the at least two electrodes using the simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses may be less than the power needed to activate the at least two electrodes in the multi-channel array using a continuous-interleaved-sampling strategy to achieve the desired potential.<br><br>
The electrode array may be implanted into a living subject For example, the electrode array may be used to stimulate the acoustic nerve.<br>
[0022] In another aspect of the invention, a method of activatmg electrodes in a multichannel electrode array includes determining a sequential stimulation sequence having a sequential stimulation sequence pulse rate and sequential stimulation sequence mean pulse amplitude, the sequential stimulation sequence for producing desired potentials at given positions relative to the multi-channel electrode array. The sequential stimulation sequence, which may be, for example, a continuous-interleaved-sampling (CIS) sequence, is converted to a channel interaction (CI) sequence using simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses and channel interaction compensation. The CI sequence has a CI pulse rate and a CI mean pulse amplitude, the CI sequence for producing resulting potentials that are substantially equal to the desired potentials at the given positions.<br>
[0023] In accordance with related embodiments of the invention, the electrodes may then be activated as a function of the CI sequence. The mean pulse amplitude for the CI sequence may be less than the mean pulse amplitude for the sequential stimulation sequence. The stimulation power required for the CI sequence may be less than the stimulation power required for the sequential stimulation sequence. The sequential stimulation sequence and/or the CI sequence may include symmetrical biphasic current pulses. The multi-channel array may use a monopolar electrode configuration having a remote ground.<br>
[0024] In accordance with further embodiments of the invention, the CI pulse rate may be substantially equal to the sequential stimulation sequence pulse rate, such that the CI sequence includes temporal gaps between pulses. The CI pulse rate may be increased, wherein the temporal gap between pulses is decreased. The pulse amplitude of the CI sequence may be reduced while increasing pulse phase duration such that charge per pulse remains substantially unchanged, wherein the temporal gap between pulses is decreased.<br>

The processor is iurther configured to simultaneously activate the at least two electrodes as a function of the determined amplitudes to achieve the desired potential at the given position.<br>

Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments<br>
[0050] In illustrative embodiments, a system and method for simultaneously activating electrodes in a multi-channel electrode array is presented. A simultaneous stimulation sequence, such as a channel interaction (CI) sequence having simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses and channel interaction compensation, includes temporal gaps between pulses. The CI sequence may be, for example, based on a sequential stimulation sequence such that the CI pulse rate is substantially equal to the sequential stimulation sequence pulse rate. For implementation offline structure strategies," the CI pulse rate is increased by filling the temporal gaps between pulses with additional pulses, such that the information rate is increased. In other embodiments, the pulse amplitudes of the CI sequence may be reduced without increasing the number of pulses per second, allowing for low power and low voltage implementations of standard sequential stimulation strategies. Details of illustrative embodiments are discussed below.<br>
[0051 J Simultaneous stimulation<br>
[0052] Referring to Fig. 3, the voltage drop across interface impedances Z1 is reduced based on simultaneous stimulation of two or more channels. If two or more electrodes<br><br>
are stimulated simultaneously, then effects of spatial channel mteraction can be exploited, as described below.<br>
[0053] a. Spatial channel interaction<br>
[0054] Spatial channel interaction occurs when different stimulation electrodes (positioned in the scala tympani) are activated and there is considerable geometric overlapping of electrical fields at the location of the excitable nerve tissue. Thus the same neurons are activated, if different electrodes are stimulated. Stimulation of a particular electrode against a remote ground electrode (monopolar stimulation) causes an electrical potential within the scala tympani which can roughly be described by two decaying exponentials at both sides of the electrode, and the space constant (in humans) is typically X =10mm.<br>
[0055] In the CIS strategy, the influence of spatial channel interaction is reduced by employing pulses which are not overlapping in time (interleaved sampling). The conductivity in the scala tympani here leads to a considerable spread and a de-focusing of the electrical field at the site of the excitable tissue. However, an additional effect occurs, if uncorrelated simultcmeous stimulation of two or more electrodes against a remote ground electrode is considered. Here the conductivity represents a shunt conductance between active electrodes, which in general results in a mixture of constructive and destructive superposition of electrical fields at the position of the neurons. For example, if two simultaneous stimulation channels produce currents with equal amplitudes, but different signs, most of the current will flow through the shunt conductance and will not reach the intended neurons.<br>
[0056] b. Sign-correlated pulses<br>
[0057] Preferred embodiments of the invention utilize the simultaneous activation of two or more electrodes in the scala tympani against a remote reference electrode (monopolar electrode configuration). Furthermore, all pulses are exactly simultaneous, that is, positive and negative pulse-phases start and stop at the same time instants, respectively. In addition, all simultaneous phases have the same sign. As used herein, such simultaneous pulses are designated as "sign-correlated" pulses.<br><br>
[0058] Employing sign-correlated pulses ensures that the sum of the single stimulation currents is always flowing through the reference electrode. Thus, at the site of the excitable neurons only constructive superposition of currents occurs.<br>
[0059] c. Channel interaction compensation (CIC)<br>
[0060] "Channel mteraction compensation (CIC)'* as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,594,525, is used to convert a set of sequential amplitudes into a set of simultaneous amplitudes, whereby the potentials within the scala tympani at the position of the activated electrodes are unchanged. An example using two electrodes is illustrated in Fig. 5(a-b).   Fig. 5(a) (prior art) shows two (normalized) scala tympani potentials due to two sequentially applied stimulation pulses of equal amplitudes. The distance between the active electrodes is 12mm. Each potential distribution shows exponential decays with Î» - 10mni at both sides. Fig. 5(b) shows the resulting potential (solid line), if two stimulation pulses are applied simultaneously and after the amplitudes have been adapted using CIC, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Note that the peak potentials at the position of the electrodes have not been changed as compared to the upper plot. This curve is the result of the superposition of the two single potentials (dotted lines). Regarding the maximum amplitudes of the single potentials, it is clear that these are reduced as compared to the potentials of the Fig. 5(a). In this example, the reduction is 23%.<br>
[0061] Reduction of stimulation power<br>
[0062] a. Reduction of stimulation power using simulataneous stimulation<br>
[0063] As a general feature of CIC, by taking into account spatial channel interaction, the stimulation pulse amplitudes are reduced. Thus, any stimulation strategy utilizing simultaneous stimulation in combination with CIC leads to an average reduction of stimulation power, if such a strategy is compared to standard CIS using the same number of stimulation pulses per second. The amount of average reduction depends on a variety of parameters, such as the number of channels used simultaneously, the distance between these channels, or the spatial decay constants. The amount of average reduction also<br><br>
depends on the probability distribution of the sequential amplitudes used as an input to CIC, Referring back to the example shown in Figs. 5(a-b), the power consumption is reduced proportional to the reduction of the stimulation amplitudes, that is by 23%. However, the case of two equal sequential amplitudes represents the "best case" with respect to power saving effects. The 'worst case" occurs, if one of the two sequential amplitudes is zero. Then CIC does not change these amplitudes, and therefore there is no power saving.<br>
[0064] For example, consider a 6-channel intra-cochlear electrode array, where the distance between adjacent electrodes is 4mm. Driven in standard CIS-mode, pulses occur strictly sequentially, for example, following fte pattern... (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (1) (2)..., as shown in Fig. 6(a). A CIC-based system is shown in Fig. 6(b), in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In Fig. 6(b), sunultaneous, sign-correlated pulses occur. More particularly, each of the three electrode pairs (1,4), (2,5), and (3,6) are simultaneous, following the pattern, without limitation, of... (1,4) (2,5) (3,6) (1,4).... The decay constant may be, for example, % = 10mm. Fig. 5(b) represents an example for such an electrode pair. Assuming that both systems utilize the same number of stimulation pulses per second and both systems use the same implant supply voltage, an average reduction of simulation power in the range of by Â«15-20% can be expected.<br>
[0065] b. Reduction by Using Longer Pulses<br>
[0066] As shown in Fig.6b, applying simultaneous pulses introduces a gap between pairs of simultaneous pulses. In case of using, without limitation, two pulses simultaneously, this gap can be closed by doubling the phase diutitions, as shown in Fig. 6c in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. For equal charge per phase, the stimulation amplitude can be reduced by a factor 2. For N simultaneous pulses, the phase durations of sequential pulses can be multiplied by N, and for equal charge per phase, the amplitudes can be divided by a factor N. This reduction in amplitudes can be exploited for a reduction of the hnplant supply voltage Vcc, that is, the implant supply voltage can be divided by N. Since the same charge per phase is used as for simultaneous pulses with short phases, the overall stimulation power being proportional to the product of implant supply voltage and the mean stimulation amplitude is reduced by a factor N.<br><br>
[0067] Both the reduction of stimulation power and the reduction of the implant supply voltage represents substantial advantages, m particular with respect to a totally implantable cochlear implant (TICI). Whereas a low power consumption is a general advantage with respect to the limited power resources in a TICI, there is a particular interest in low-voltage stimulation strategies, where stimulation runs at very low implant supply voltages down to Vcc = 3V. In contemporary cochlear implants, the implant supply voltage is typically about Vcc = 5-6V. If low-voltage stimulation strategies are applied, then the voltage produced by rechargeable batteries can directly be used directly. For example, lithium polymer secondary batteries using lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) produce 3,65V. Such a supply voltage would not be sufficient for the unplementation of the standard CIS-strategy. Therefore voltage doubling or similar circuits are necessary, and such circuits considerably increase size and power consumption of a TICI.<br>
[0068] In illustrative embodiments of the invention, applying simultaneous stimulation using sign-correlated pulses m combination with CIC can be exploited to increase the information rate, for example, in applying "fine structure" stimulation strategies. Fig. 7 shows a method of increasing the stimulation information rate, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. The method may be implemented, without limitation, by a stimulation system that includes: a stimulator 105 having a multi-channel electrode array 107 utilizing a monopolar electrode configuration; and a controller, such as processor 101 for controlling the stimulator 105, as shown in Fig. 1. Controller may include, without limitation, various circuitry, and/or memory and be appropriately preprogrammed or configured to be loaded with an appropriate program. Memory may include, for example, a diskette, a fixed disk, a Compact Disk (CD), Read Only Memory (ROM), Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), and/or Random Access Memory (RAM). As shown in Fig, 1, various parts of the system may be implantable, and may be part of a cochlear implant that stimulates the acoustic nerve.<br>
[0069] In step 702 of Fig. 7, the controller determines a channel interaction (CI) sequence using simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses and channel interaction compensation. As described above, the CI sequence has a CI pulse rate and a CI mean pulse amplitude, and produces resulting potentials that are substantially equal to desired potentials at given positions relative to the multi-channel array.<br><br>
[0070] In various embodiments of the invention, the controller determines the CI sequence by determining a sequential stimulation sequence, such as a CIS sequence, having a sequential stimulation sequence pulse rate and sequential stimulation sequence mean pulse amplitude for producing desired potentials at given positions relative to the multi-channel electrode array. The controller then converts the sequential stimulation sequence into a channel interaction (CI) sequence that uses simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses and channel interaction compensation, so as to produce resulting potentials that are substantially equal to the desired potentials at the given positions. As noted above, each of the CI pulse amplitudes is typically less than the amplitude needed to activate an electrode in the multi-channel electrode array using the sequential stimulation sequence, as simultaneous CI pulses are added to produce the desired potentials.<br>
[0071] Such a converted CI sequence, or an initially determmed CI sequence, may include temporal gaps between pulses. This can be advantageously exploited by the controller, for example, by increasing the CI pulse rate such that the temporal gap between pulses is decreased, as shown in step 704 of Fig. 7. The increased stimulation rate allows for implantation of fine structure stimulation strategies, as described above. Based on the CI sequence, the controller then simultaneously activates at least two electrodes as a function of the determined CI pulse amplitudes to achieve, via spatial channel interaction, the desired potential at the given position.<br>
[0072] As described above, in various embodiments the temporal gap between pulses may also be advantageously exploited to allow for low-power and low-voltage implementations of standard CIS-stimulation strategies. Fig. 8 shows a method of decreasing stimulation power and voltage requirements, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.   In step 802 of Fig. 8, the controller determines a channel interaction (CI) sequence using simultaneous, sign-correlated pulses and channel interaction compensation, similar to step 703 in Fig. 7.  In step 804 of Fig. 8, the pulse amplitudes of the CI sequence are reduced while increasing pulse phase duration, such that charge per pulse remains substantially unchanged and the temporal gap between pulses is decreased,<br>
[0073] In various embodiments, the disclosed method may be implemented as a computer program product for use with a computer system. Such implementation may<br><br>
include a series of computer instructions fixed either on a tangible medium, such as a computer readable media (e.g., a diskette, CD-ROM, ROM, or fixed disk) or transmittable to a computer system, via a modem or other interface device, such as a communications adapter connected to a network over a medium.
