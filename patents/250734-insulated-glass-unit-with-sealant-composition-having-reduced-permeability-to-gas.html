U.S.A.<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is generally related to thermally insulating structures, and more particularly to a high thermal efficiency, insulated glass unit structure sealed with room temperature cured compositions having reduced permeability to gas, or mixtures of gases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insulating glass units (IGU) commonly have two panels of glass separated by a spacer. The two panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with air. The transfer of energy through an insulating glass unit of this typical construction is reduced, due to the inclusion of the insulating layer of air in the inner space, as compared to a single panel of glass. The energy transfer may be further reduced by increasing the separation between the panels to increase the insulating blanket of air. There is a limit to the maximum separation beyond which convection within the air between the panels can increase energy transfer. The energy transfer may be further reduced by adding more layers of insulation in the form of additional inner spaces and enclosing glass panels. For example three parallel spaced apart panels of glass separated by two inner spaces and sealed at their periphery. In this manner the separation of the panels is kept below the maximum limit imposed by convection effects in the airspace, yet the overall energy transfer can be further reduced. If further reduction in energy transfer is desired then additional inner spaces can be added.<br>
Additionally, the energy transfer of sealed insulating glass units may be reduced by substituting the air in a sealed insulated glass window for a denser, lower conductivity gas. Suitable gases should be colorless, non-toxic, non-corrosive, non¬flammable, unaffected by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and denser than air, and of lower conductivity than air. Argon, krypton, xenon, and sulfur hexaflouride are<br>
-2-<br><br>
examples of gases which are commonly substituted for air in insulating glass windows to reduce energy transfer.<br>
Various types of sealants are currently used in the manufacture of insulated glass units including both curing and non-curing systems. Liquid polysulphides, polyurethanes and silicones represent curing systems, which are commonly used, while polybutylene-polyisoprene copolymer rubber based hot melt sealants are commonly used non-curing systems.<br>
Liquid polysulphides and polyurethanes are generally two component systems comprising a base and a curing agent that are then mixed just prior to application to the glass. Silicones may be one component as well as two component systems. Two component systems require a set mix ratio, two-part mixing equipment and cure time before the insulating glass units can be moved onto the next manufacturing stage.<br>
However, current RTC silicone sealant compositions, while effective to some extent, still have only a limited ability to prevent the loss of low thermal conductivity gas, e.g., argon, from the inner space of an IGU. As a result of this permeability, the reduced energy transfer maintained by the gas between the panels of glass is lost over time.<br>
A need therefore exists for an IGU with a RTC composition of reduced gas permeability compared to that of known RTC compositions. When employed as the sealant for an IGU, an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability will retain the intra- panel insulating gas of an IGU for a longer period of time compared to that of a more permeable RTC composition and therefore will extend the insulating properties of the IGU over a longer period of time.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an insulated glass unit with increased thermal insulation stability. Specifically, the present invention relates to an insulated glass unit which comprises at least two spaced-apart sheets (panes) of glass, or of other functionally equivalent material, in spaced relationship to each other, a low thermal conductivity gas therebetween and a gas sealant element including a cured sealant composition resulting from the curing of, moisture-curable silylated resin-containing composition comprising:<br>
a)	moisture-curable silylated resin, which upon curing, provides a cured resin exhibiting permeability to gas;<br>
b)	at least one organic nanoclay; and, optionally,<br>
c)	at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the cured resin (a).<br>
When used as a component of the gas sealant element of an IGU, the foregoing cured sealant composition reduces the loss of gas(es) from the IGU thus extending its useful service life.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1	is a sectional side view of a double glazed insulated glass unit (IGU)<br>
possessing  a   gas   sealant  element  which  includes a cured sealant composition in accordance with the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an insulated glass unit comprising at least two spaced-apart sheets of glass in spaced relationship to each other, a low thermal conductivity insulating gas or mixture of gases therebetween and gas sealant<br>
-4-<br><br>
element including a'cured, i.e., crosslinked or vulcanized, sealant composition resulting from the curing of, moisture-curable silylated resin-containing composition comprising: a) moisture-curable silylated resin, which upon curing, provides cured resin, exhibiting permeability to gas; b) at least one organic nanoclay; and, optionally, c) at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the cured resin (a).<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, insulated glass unit 10 of known and conventional construction includes glass sheets 1 and 2 maintained in spaced-apart relationship by a gas sealant element possessing a primary gas sealant member 4, continuous spacer member 5 and low gas permeable sealant composition 7 prepared as hereinafter described, space 6 between sheets 1 and 2 being filled with an insulating gas or gases such as argon. A glazing bead 8, as known in the art, is placed between glass sheets 1 and 2 and window frame 9. Panes 1 and 2 can be fabricated from any of a variety of materials such as glass, e.g., clear float glass, annealed glass, tempered glass, solar glass, tinted glass, e.g., low energy glass, etc., acrylic resin and polycarbonate resin, and the like.<br>
The inclusion of cured sealant composition 7 in the foregoing gas sealant provides improved gas barrier characteristics and moisture leakage characteristics relative to known and conventional gas sealants. As a result, cured sealant composition 7 provides for longer in-service performance of insulated glass units of all manner of construction including that specifically described above.<br>
Primary sealant member 4 of the insulated glass unit can be comprised of polymeric materials known in the art, for example, rubber base materials such as polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, polysulfide, EPDM rubber, nitrile rubber, and the like. Other useful materials include, polyisobutylene/polyisoprene copolymers, polyisobutylene polymers, brominated olefin polymers, copolymers of polisobutylene and para-methylstyrene, copolymers of polyisobutylene and brominated   para-methylstyrene,   butyl   rubber-copolymer   of   isobutylene   and<br>
-5-<br><br>
isoprene, ethylene-propylene polymers, polysulfide polymers, polyurethane polymers, styrene butadiene polymers, and the like.<br>
As indicated above, primary gas sealant member 4 can be fabricated from a material such as polyisobutylene which has very good sealing properties. Glazing bead 8 is a sealant that is sometimes referred to as the glazing bedding and can be provided in the form of a silicone or butyl rubber. A desiccant can be included in continuous spacer 5 in order to remove moisture from the insulating gas occupied space between glass panes 1 and 2. Useful desiccants are those that do not adsorb the insulating gas/gases filling the interior of the insulated glass unit.<br>
Suitable low thermal conductivity gases and mixtures of such gases for use in the insulated glass unit are well know and include transparent gases such as air, carbon dioxide, sulfur hexafloride, nitrogen, argon, krypton, xenon, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The moisture-curable silylated resin (a) which can be employed in the present invention are known materials and in general can be obtained by (i) reacting an isocyanate-terminated polyurethane (PUR) prepolymer with a suitable silane, e.g., one possessing both hydrolyzable functionality, such as, alkoxy etc., and active hydrogen- containing functionality such as mercaptan, primary and secondary amine, preferably the latter, etc., or by (ii) reacting a hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer with a suitable isocyanate-terminated silane, e.g., one possessing one to three alkoxy groups. The details of these reactions, and those for preparing the isocyanate-terminated and hydroxyl- terminated PUR prepolymers employed therein can be found in, amongst others: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,985,491, 5,919,888, 6,207,794, 6,303,731, 6,359,101 and 6,515,164 and published U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2004/0122253 and 2005/0020706 (isocyanate- terminated PUR prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,786,081 and 4,481,367 (hydroxyl- terminated PUR prepolymers); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,627,722, 3,632,557, 3,971,751, 5,623,044, 5,852,137, 6,197,912 and 6,310,170 (moisture-curable SPUR obtained from reaction of isocyanate-terminated<br>

PUR prepolymer and reactive silane, e.g., aminoalkoxysilane); and, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,345,053, 4,625,012, 6,833,423 and "published U.S. Patent Application 2002/0198352 (moisture-curable SPUR obtained from reaction of hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer and isocyanatosilane). The entire contents of the foregoing U.S. patent documents are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The moisture-curable silylated resin (a) of the present invention may also be obtained by (iii) reacting isocyanatosilane directly with polyol.<br>
(a)      Moisture-curable SPUR Resin Obtained From Isocyanate- terminated PUR<br>
Prepolymer<br>
The isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are obtained by reacting one or more polyols, advantageously, diols, with one or more polyisocyanates, advantageously, diisocyanates, in such proportions that the resulting prepolymers will be terminated with isocyanate. In the case of reacting a diol with a diisocyanate, a molar excess of diisocyanate will be employed.<br>
Included among the polyols that can be utilized for the preparation of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymer are polyether polyols, polyester polyols such as the hydroxyl-terminated polycaprolatones, polyetherester polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of polyether polyol with e-caprolactone, polyesterether polyols such as those obtained from the reaction of hydroxyl-terminated polycaprolactones with one or more alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadienes, and the like.<br>
Specific suitable polyols include the polyether diols, in particular, the poly(oxyethylene) diols, the poly(oxypropylene) diols and the poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) diols, polyoxyalkylene triols, polytetramethylene glycols, polyacetals, polyhydroxy polyacrylates, polyhydroxy polyester amides and polyhydroxy polythioethers, polycaprolactone diols and triols, and the like. In one embodiment of<br>
-7-<br><br>
the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are poly(oxyethylene) diols with equivalent weights between about 500 and 25,000. In another embodiment of the present invention, the polyols used in the production of the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers are poly(oxypropylene) diols with equivalent weights between about 1,000 to 20,000. Mixtures of polyols of various structures, molecular weights and/or functionalities can also be used.<br>
The polyether polyols can have a functionality up to about 8 but advantageously have a functionality of from about 2 to 4 and more advantageously, a functionality of 2 (i.e., diols). Especially suitable are the polyether polyols prepared in the presence of double-metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts, an alkaline metal hydroxide catalyst, or an alkaline metal alkoxide catalyst; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,829,505, 3,941,849, 4,242,490, 4,335,188, 4,687,851, 4,985,491, 5,096,993, 5,100,997, 5,106,874, 5,116,931, 5,136,010, 5,185,420, and 5,266,681, the entire contents of which are incorporated here by reference. Polyether polyols produced in the presence of such catalysts tend to have high molecular weights and low levels of unsaturation, properties of which, it is believed, are responsible for the improved performance of inventive retroreflective articles. The polyether polyols preferably have a number average molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 25,000, more preferably from about 2,000 to about 20,000, and even more preferably from about 4,000 to about 18,000. The polyether polyols preferably have an end group unsaturation level of no greater than about 0.04 milliequivalents per gram of polyol. More preferably, the polyether polyol has an end group unsaturation of no greater than about 0.02 milliequivalents per gram of polyol. Examples of commercially available diols that are suitable for making the isocyanate-terminate PUR prepolymer include ARCOL R-1819 (number average molecular weight of 8,000), E-2204 (number average molecular weight of 4,000), and ARCOL E-2211 (number average molecular weight of 11,000).<br>
Any of numerous polyisocyanates, advantageously, diisocyanates, and mixtures thereof,can be used to provide the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers. In one<br>
-8-<br><br>
embodiment, the polyisocyanate can be diphenylmethane diisocyanate ("MDI"), polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate ("PMDI"), paraphenylene diisocyanate, naphthylene diisocyanate, liquid carbodiimide-modified MDI and derivatives thereof, isophorone diisocyanate, dicyclohexylrnethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate ("TDI"), particularly the 2,6-TDI isomer, as well as various other aliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates that are well-established in the art, and combinations thereof.<br>
Silylation reactants for reaction with the isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolymers described above must contain functionality that is reactive with isocyanate and at least one readily hydrolyzable and subsequently crosslinkable group, e.g.,.alkoxy. Particularly,, useful silylation reactants are the aminosilanes, especially those of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl of up to 8 carbon atoms or aryl of up to 8 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R3 is the same or different alkyl or aryl group of up to 8 carbon atoms, each R4 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and x is 0, 1 or 2. In one embodiment, R1 is hydrogen or a methyl, ethyl, propyl, 'isopropyl, n- butyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl group, R2 possesses 1 to 4 carbon atoms, each R4 is the same or different methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl group and x is 0.<br>

A catalyst will ordinarily be used in the preparation of the isocyanate- terminated PUR prepolymers. Advantageously, condensation catalysts are employed since these will also catalyze the cure (hydrolysis followed by crosslinking) of the SPUR resin component of the curable compositions of the invention. Suitable condensation catalysts include the dialkyltin dicarboxylates such as dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin acetate, tertiary amines, the stannous salts of carboxylic acids, such as stannous octoate and stannous acetate, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention, dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst is used in the production of the PUR prepolymer. Other useful catalysts include zirconium complex (KAT XC6212, K-KAT XC-A209 available from King Industries, Inc., aluminum chelate (TYZER® types available from DuPont company, and KR types available from Kenrich Petrochemical, Inc., and other organic metal, such as Zn, Co, Ni, and Fe, and the like.<br>
(b)       Moisture-curable SPUR Resins Obtained From Hydroxyl- terminated PUR Preolymers<br>
- 10-<br><br>
The moisture-curable SPUR resin can, as previously indicated, be prepared by reacting a hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer with an isocyanatosilane. The hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer can be obtained in substantially the same manner employing substantially the same materials, i.e., polyols, polyisocyanates and optional catalysts (preferably condensation catalysts), described above for the preparation of isocyanate-terminated PUR prepolynmers the one major difference being that the proportions of polyol and polyisocyanate will be such as to result in hydroxyl-termination in the resulting prepolymer. Thus, e.g., in the case of a diol and a diisocyanate, a molar excess of the former will be used thereby resulting in hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymer.<br>
Useful silylation reactants for the hydroxyl-terminated SPUR resins are those containing isocyanate termination and readily hydrolizable functionality, e.g., 1 to 3 alkoxy groups. Suitable silylating reactants are the isocyanatosilanes of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R5 is an alkylene group of up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, each R6 is the same or different alkyl or aryl group of up to 8 carbon atoms, each R7 is the same or different alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and y is 0,1 or 2. In one embodiment, R5 possesses 1 to 4 carbon atoms, each R7 is the same or different methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl group and y is 0.<br>
Specific isocyanatosilanes that can be used herein to react with the foregoing<br>
hydroxyl-terminated PUR prepolymers to provide moisture-curable SPUR resins<br>
include isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyl trimethoxysilane,<br>
isocyanato-n-butyltrimethoxysilane,	isocyanato-t-butyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
-11 -<br><br>
isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, isocyanatoisopropyltriethoxysilane, isocynato-n-butyltriethoxysilane, isocyanato-t-butyltriethoxysilane, and the like.<br>
c)        Moisture-curable   SPUR   Resins   Obtained From Reacting Isocvanatosilane directly with a Polyol.<br>
The moisture-curable SPUR resins of the present invention can be obtained from one or more polyols, advantageously, diols, reacting directly with isocyanatosilane without the initial formation of a polyurethane prepolymer. The materials, i.e., polyols and silanes (e.g., one possessing both hydrolysable and isocyanato functionality, useful for this approach to producing moisture-curable SPUR resin are described above. As such, suitable polyols include, hydroxy-terminated polyols having a molecular weight between about 4,000 to 20,000. However, mixtures of polyols of various structures, molecular weights and/or functionalities can also be used. Suitable isocyanatosilanes used to react with the foregoing polyols to provide moisture-curable SPUR resins are described above.<br>
The urethane prepolymer synthesis and subsequent silylation reaction, as well as the direct reaction of polyol and isocyanatosilane are conducted under anhydrous conditions and preferably under an inert atmosphere, such as a blanket of nitrogen, to prevent premature hydrolysis of the alkoxysilane groups. Typical temperature range for both reaction steps, is 0° to 150° C, and more preferably between 60° and 90° C. Typically, the total reaction time for the synthesis of the silylated polyurethane is between 4 to 8 hours.<br>
The synthesis is monitored using a standard titration technique (ASTM 2572-87) or infrared analysis. Silylation of the urethane prepolymers is considered complete when no residual -NCO can be detected by either technique.<br>
The curable composition of the present invention includes at least one organic<br>
nanoclay filler (b). Nanoclays possess a unique morphology with one dimension<br>
being in the nanometer range. The nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an<br>
- 12-<br><br>
intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
When describing the organic nanoclay filler of the present invention, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay platelets separate from one another in a polymer matrix. During exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>
The term "intercalant" as used herein includes any inorganic or organic compound capable of entering the clay gallery and bonding to the surface.<br>
The term "intercalate" as used herein designates a clay-chemical complex wherein the clay gallery spacing has increased due to the process of surface modification. Under the proper conditions of temperature and shear, an intercalate is capable of exfoliating in a resin matrix.<br>
The expression "modified clay" as used herein designates a clay material that has been treated with any inorganic or organic compound that is capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the clay.<br>
-13-<br><br>
The term "nanoclay" as used herein describes clay materials that possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. Nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionically bonds to surfaces in between the layers making up the clay particles.
