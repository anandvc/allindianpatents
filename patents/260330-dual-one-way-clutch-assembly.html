				<td>DUAL ONE-WAY CLUTCH ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to torque transmitting devices,<br>
and more particularly to a torque transmitting device having a plurality of<br>
clutches.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] There are many devices for transmitting torque known in the art.<br>
Examples include hydraulically actuated clutch plates, dog clutches actuated by<br>
shift forks, and one-way clutches. These devices are able to transmit torque<br>
between two separate components, and each are useful for their intended<br>
purpose.<br>
[0004] The one-way clutch is a compact design used in many<br>
applications for transmitting torque in one rotational direction. A typical one-way<br>
clutch includes an inner ring disposed within an outer ring. A connecting member<br>
is located between the rings for selectively transmitting torque between the rings.<br>
The connecting member may take various forms, for example, a sprag, roller, or<br>
diode. The connecting member acts to engage the rings in order to transmit<br>
torque when one of the rings is rotated in a first direction. If the rings are rotated<br>
in an opposite direction, the connecting member does not engage the rings, and<br>
1<br><br>
torque is not transmitted through the one-way clutch. In this way the one-way<br>
clutch is effective in transmitting torque between two components.<br>
[0005] However, a known limitation with a one-way clutch is that<br>
different torque settings cannot be selected. While various solutions have been<br>
provided in the past, there remains room in the art for improvement in providing a<br>
selectable clutch assembly that includes desirable packaging flexibility,<br>
component size advantages, control complexity, and decreased torque losses.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide the art with a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not inuhnded to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0030] In order to provide a clear description of the present invention,<br>
two clutches, illustrated in FIG.'s 1A and 1B, will first be described. These two<br>
clutches are employed throughout the various embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0031] With reference to FIG. 1A, a rocker one-way clutch 10, or clutch<br>
10, employed in the present invention is illustrated. The clutch 10 includes a first<br>
race 12. The first race 12 is annular in shape and includes an outer surface 14.<br>
A plurality of recesses 16 are formed in the outer surface 14 and are spaced<br>
annularly around the inner perimeter of the first race 12. A plurality of slots 18<br>
are also formed on the outer surface 14 and the slots 18 are spaced annularly<br>
around the inner circumference of the first race 12. The slots 18 are disposed<br>
adjacent to the recesses 16.<br>
[0032] The clutch 10 further includes a plurality of rockers 20. The<br>
rockers 20 include a body 22 and an arm 24. The arm 24 extends away from the<br>
body 22. The rockers 20 are pivotally connected to the outer surface 14 of the<br>
6<br><br>
first race 12 such that for each rocker 20, the body 22 fits within a recess 16, and<br>
the arm 24 extends over an adjacent slot 18. As will be described in further<br>
detail below, the rockers 20 are designed to selectively transmit torque through<br>
the clutch 10.<br>
[0033] A plurality of biasing members 26 are disposed within the slots<br>
18. In the present example the biasing members 26 are coil springs, but it<br>
should be appreciated that various other types of biasing members may be<br>
employed. The biasing members 26 engage the arm 24 and urge the rocker 20<br>
to rotate in a first direction A. In the present example the first direction A is<br>
illustrated as rotationally clockwise, but it should be appreciated that the rockers<br>
20, slots 18, and biasing members 26 may be oriented in an opposite direction<br>
such that the rotation in the first direction A is counter-clockwise.<br>
[0034] The clutch 10 also includes a second race 30. The second race<br>
30 is disposed radially outward of the first race 12 such that the rockers 20 are<br>
disposed between the first race 12 and the second race 30. The second race 30<br>
is concentric to the first race 12. The second race 30 is generally annular in<br>
shape and includes an inner surface 32. A plurality of pockets 34 are formed on<br>
the inner surface 32 and are spaced annulariy around the inner circumference of<br>
the second race 30,<br>
[0035] Torque is transmitted through the clutch 10 when the first race<br>
12 is rotationally fixed to the second race 30 by the clockwise rotation of the<br>
rockers 20. More specifically, engagement of the rockers 20 to the second race<br>
30 occurs when the first race 12 rotates in a direction X as indicated in FIG 1A or<br>
7<br><br>
when the second race 30 rotates in a direction Y as indicated in FIG. 1A.<br>
Specifically, the rockers 20 are biased to rotate in the first direction A such that<br>
the arms 24 engage the pockets 34 of the second race 30. This engagement by<br>
the rockers 20 rotationally fixes the first race 12 and the second race 30 together.<br>
Disengagement of the rockers 20 to the second race 30 occurs when the first<br>
race 12 in the direction Y or when the second race 30 rotates in the direction X.<br>
The inner surface 32 of the second race 30 urges the rockers 20 to rotate in a<br>
direction opposite to the first direction A, and the arms 24 move out of the<br>
pockets 34 of the second race 30. This disengagement of the rockers 20 allows<br>
the first race 12 and the second race 30 to rotate freely with respect to one<br>
another.<br>
[0036] FIG. 1B illustrates a selectable rocker one-way clutch 50, or<br>
selectable clutch 50. The selectable clutch 50 is substantially identical to the<br>
clutch 10, however, the rockers 20 and slots 18 are oriented in an opposite<br>
direction to the rockers 20 and slots 18 in the clutch 10. Specifically, the biasing<br>
member 26 engages the arm 24 and urges the rocker to rotate in a second<br>
direction B. The second direction B is rotationally opposite to the first direction A.<br>
In the present example the second direction B is illustrated as rotationally<br>
counter-clockwise, but it should be appreciated that the rockers 20, slots 18, and<br>
biasing members 26 may be oriented in an opposite direction such that the<br>
rotation of the second direction A is clockwise so long as the rockers 20, slots 18,<br>
and biasing members 26 of the clutch 10 are similarly re-oriented such that the<br>
8<br><br>
rockers 20 of the clutch 10 are biased in a direction opposite to the rockers 20 of<br>
the selectable clutch 50.<br>
[0037] The selectable clutch 50 further includes a selector ring 54. The<br>
selector ring 54 is disposed between the first race 12 and the second race 30<br>
and is concentric to the first race 12. The selector ring 54 includes a plurality of<br>
tabs 56 that extend in an axial direction relative to the selectable clutch 50. The<br>
selector ring 54 is rotationally moveable by an actuator (not shown) between a<br>
first position and a second position. When the selector ring 54 is in the first<br>
position, the tabs 56 engage the rockers 20 and prevent the rockers 20 from<br>
rotating into pockets 34. The first position is illustrated in FIG. 1B. When the<br>
selector ring 54 is in the second position, the tabs 56 do not engage the rockers<br>
20 and the rockers 20 are allowed to rotate unimpeded.<br>
[0038] Torque is transmitted through the selectable clutch 50 in a<br>
manner similar to the clutch 10. Engagement of the rockers 20 to the second<br>
race 30 occurs when the first race 12 rotates in the direction Y or when the<br>
second race 30 rotates in the direction X. Specifically, when the rockers 20 are<br>
biased to rotate in the second direction B such that the arms 24 engage the<br>
pockets 34 of the second race 30. This engagement by the rockers 20<br>
rotationally fixes the first race 12 and the second race 30 together.<br>
Disengagement of the rockers 20 from the second race 30 occurs when the first<br>
race 12 rotates in the direction X or when the second race 30 rotates in the<br>
direction Y. The inner surface 32 of the second race 30 urges the rockers 20 to<br>
rotate in a direction opposite to the second direction B, and the arms 24 move<br>
9<br><br>
out of the pockets 34 of the second race 30. This disengagement by the rockers<br>
20 allows the first race 12 and the second race 30 to rotate freely with respect to<br>
one another. When the selector ring 54 is moved to the first position, as noted<br>
above, the tabs 56 prevent the rockers 20 from rotating to engage the second<br>
race 30. The selector ring 54 thereby prevents transmission of torque through<br>
the selectable clutch 50 irrespective of the relative movements between the first<br>
race )?. and the second race 30. essentially allowing the first race 12 and the<br>
second race 30 to rotate relative to one another unimpeded.<br>
[0039] Turning now to FIG. 2, a first clutch assembly 100 employing<br>
the clutch 10 and the selectable clutch 50 is illustrated, in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The clutch 10 is disposed axially adjacent<br>
to the selectable clutch 50. The first race 12 of the clutch 10 is rotationally fixed<br>
to the first race 12 of the selectable clutch 50 forming an inner race 102.<br>
[0040] The second race 30 of the clutch 10 is rotationally fixed to the<br>
second race 30 of the selectable clutch 50 forming an outer race 104. The inner<br>
race 102 is coupled to a first component 106 and the outer race 104 is coupled to<br>
a second component 108. The clutch 10 and the selectable clutch 50 are<br>
oriented within the first clutch assembly 100 such that the rockers 20 of the clutch<br>
10 are oriented opposite to the rockers 20 of the selectable clutch 50.<br>
Specifically, arrow 1A-1A and arrow 1B-1B correspond to the views in FIG.'s 1A<br>
and lo, respectively.<br>
[0041] The rockers 20 of the clutch 10 are disposed axially adjacent to<br>
the rockers 20 of the selectable clutch 50. In the example provided the rockers<br>
10<br><br>
20 of the clutch 10 and the rockers 20 of the selectable clutch 50 are aligned with<br>
one another axially, however, it should be appreciated that the rockers 20 may<br>
be positioned out of alignment axially to one another. Additionally, the pockets<br>
34 of the clutch 10 and the pockets 34 of the selectable clutch 50 may be aligned<br>
to form a single pocket 110, or alternatively remain discrete separate pockets.<br>
«0042] During operation of the first clutch assembly 100, one or both of<br>
the (irst component 106 and the second component 108 are rotatable.<br>
Additionally, one of the first component 106 and the second component 108 may<br>
be fixed from rotation. Torque is transmitted between the first component 106<br>
and the second component 108 when the rockers 20 of the clutch 10 couple the<br>
inner race 12 to the outer race 30 (as shown and described in Fig. 1A) and when<br>
the rockers 20 of the selectable clutch 50 couple the inner race 12 to the outer<br>
race 30 (as shown and described in Fig. 1B). This in turn couples the inner race<br>
102 to the outer race 104. Torque is not transmitted between the first component<br>
106 and the second component 108 when the selector ring 54 is in the first<br>
position and prevents the rockers 20 of the selectable clutch 50 from engaging<br>
the outer race 104. It should be appreciated that the orientations of the clutch 10<br>
and selectable clutch 50 may be reversed to allow for specific directions of torque<br>
transfer and free movement.<br>
[0043] FIG. 3 illustrates a second clutch assembly 200 according to the<br>
principies of the present invention. The second clutch assembly 200 is similar to<br>
the first clutch assembly 100 shown in FIG. 2 in that the second clutch assembly<br>
200 includes the clutch 10 coupled with the selectable clutch 50. However, in the<br>
11<br><br>
second clutch assembly 200, the clutch 10 is displaced from the selectable clutch<br>
50. More specifically, the clutch 10 is displaced from the selectable clutch 50 in<br>
an axial direction and in a radial direction, though it should be appreciated that<br>
any configuration of displacement may be employed.<br>
[0044] The first race 12 of the clutch 10 is coupled to the first race 12 of<br>
the selectable clutch 50 by a coupling 210. The coupling 210 may be any<br>
assembly operable to transmit torque between the clutch 10 and the selectable<br>
clutch 50, such as, for example, a gear box having pinions or bevel gears. The<br>
second race 30 of the clutch 10 is coupled to a first component 212, which is<br>
preferably a shaft. The second race 30 of the selectable clutch 50 is coupled to a<br>
second component 214. The first and second components 212, 214 are both<br>
preferably shafts, though various other devices may be employed. Additionally,<br>
the first component 212 and the second component 214 may either be rotatable<br>
or fixed. Torque is transmitted through the second clutch assembly 200 in a<br>
manner substantially similar to that of the first clutch assembly 100 in FIG. 2.<br>
Alternate embodiments of the second clutch assembly 200 that vary the<br>
connections between the races 12, 30 of the clutches 10, 50 may be employed<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the first<br>
component 212 may be coupled to the first race 12 of the clutch 10, or the<br>
second component 214 may be coupled to the first race 12 of the selectable<br>
clutch 50. Additionally, the coupling 210 may extend between the second race<br>
30 of the clutch 10 and the second race 30 of the selectable clutch 50, or extend<br>
12<br><br>
between one of the races 12 of the clutches 10, 50 to one of the race 30 of the<br>
clutches 10, 50.<br>
[0045] FIG. 4 illustrates a third clutch assembly 300 according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. The third clutch assembly 300 includes a first<br>
race 302, a second race 304, and a third race 306 substantially similar to the<br>
second race 30 of the clutch 10 illustrated in FIG. 1A. The second race 304 is<br>
disposed radially outward of the first race 302 and is concentric with the first race<br>
302. The third race 306 is disposed radially outward of the second race 304 and<br>
is also concentric with the first race 302.<br>
[0046] The first race 302 is substantially similar to the first race 12 of<br>
the ciuich 10 illustrated in FIG. 1A and includes an outer surface 303, a plurality<br>
of recesses 305 formed in the outer surface 303, and a plurality of slots 307<br>
formed on the outer surface 303 and disposed adjacent to the recesses 305<br>
[0047] The second race 304 includes an inner surface 308 and an<br>
outer surface 310. A plurality of pockets 312 are formed on the inner surface 308<br>
and are spaced annularly around the inner circumference of the second race<br>
304. A plurality of recesses 314 are formed on the outer surface 310 and are<br>
spaced annularly around the outer circumference of the second race 304. A<br>
plurality of slots 316 are also formed in the outer surface 310 and are spaced<br>
annularly around the outer circumference of the second race 304. The slots 316<br>
are disposed adjacent to the recesses 314.<br>
[0048] The third race 306 is substantially similar to the second race 30<br>
of the clutch 10 illustrated in FIG. 1A and includes an inner surtace 317. A<br>
13<br><br>
plurality of pockets 319 are formed on the inner surface 317 and are spaced<br>
annularly around the inner circumference of the third race 306.<br>
[0049] The third clutch assembly 300 further includes a plurality of first<br>
rockers 318. The first rockers 318 are substantially similar to the rockers 20 of<br>
the clutch 10 and selectable clutch 50 illustrated in FIG.'s 1A and 1B. The first<br>
rockers 318 include a body 321 and an arm 323. The first rockers 318 are<br>
pivotally connected to the outer surface 303 of the first race 302 such that for<br>
each first rocker 318, the body 321 fits within a recess 305, and the arm 323<br>
extends over an adjacent slot 307. As will be described in further detail below,<br>
the rockers 318 are designed to selectively engage and disengage the second<br>
race 304 to transmit torque through the third clutch assembly 300.<br>
[0050] A plurality of first biasing members 320 are disposed within the<br>
slots 307. The biasing members 320 are substantially similar to the biasing<br>
members 26 of the clutch 10 in FIG. 1A. The biasing members 320 engage the<br>
arm 323 and urge the rocker 318 to rotate in a first direction C. In the present<br>
example the first direction C is illustrated as rotationally clockwise, but it should<br>
be appreciated that the rockers 318, slots 307, and biasing members 320 may be<br>
oriented in an opposite direction such that the rotation in the first direction C is<br>
counter-clockwise.<br>
[0051] The third clutch assembly 300 further includes a plurality of<br>
second rockers 324. The plurality of second rockers 324 are substantially similar<br>
to the rockers 20 of the clutch 10 and selectable clutch 50 in FIG.'s 1A and 1B.<br>
The second rockers 324 include a body 325 and an arm 327. The second<br>
14<br><br>
rockers 324 are pivotally connected to the outer surface 310 of the second race<br>
304 such that for each second rocker 324, the body 325 fits within a recess 314,<br>
and the arm 327 extends over an adjacent slot 316. The second rockers 324 are<br>
oriented in an opposite direction to the first rockers 318. As will be described in<br>
further detail below, the second rockers 324 are designed to selectively engage<br>
and disengage the third race 306 to transmit torque through the third clutch<br>
assembly 300.<br>
[0052] A plurality of second biasing members 326 are disposed within<br>
the slots 316. The biasing members 326 are substantially similar to the biasing<br>
members 26 of the clutch 10 in FIG. 1A. The biasing members 326 engage the<br>
arm 327 and urge the second rocker 324 to rotate in a second direction D. In the<br>
present example the second direction D is illustrated as rotationally counter-<br>
clockwise, but it should be appreciated that the second rockers 324, slots 316,<br>
and biasing members 326 may be oriented in an opposite direction such that the<br>
rotation in the second direction D is clockwise so long as the second rockers 324,<br>
slots 316, and biasing members 326 are oriented opposite to the first rockers<br>
318, slots 18, and biasing members 320.<br>
[0053] The third clutch assembly 300 further includes a selector ring<br>
330. I he selector ring 330 is substantially similar to the selector ring 54 of the<br>
selectable clutch 50 in FIG. 1B. The selector ring 330 is disposed between the<br>
second race 304 and the third race 306 and is concentric with the first race 302.<br>
The selector ring 330 includes a plurality of tabs 332 that extend in an axial<br>
direction relative to the third clutch assembly 300. The selector ring 330 is<br>
15<br><br>
rotationally moveable by an actuator (not shown) between a first position and a<br>
second position. When the selector ring 330 is in the first position, the tabs 332<br>
are positioned between the arms 327 and the third race 306 and thereby prevent<br>
the second rockers 324 from rotating and engaging the recesses 319 in the third<br>
race 306. When the selector ring 330 is in the second position, the tabs 332 are<br>
not between the arms 327 and the third race 306 and therefore the second<br>
rockers 324 are allowed to move unimpeded. The second position of the<br>
selector ring 330 is illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
[0054] Torque is transmitted through the third clutch assembly 300<br>
when the first race 302 and second race 304 are rotationally fixed together by the<br>
first rockers 318. Engagement of the first rockers 318 to the second race 304<br>
occurs when the first race 302 rotates in the direction X or when the second race<br>
304 rotates in the direction Y or remains stationary. Specifically, the first rockers<br>
318 are biased to rotate in the first direction C such that the arms 323 engage the<br>
pockets 312 of the second race 304. This engagement by the first rockers 318<br>
rotationally fixes the first race 302 and the second race 304. Disengagement of<br>
the first rockers 318 to the second race 304 occurs when the first race 302<br>
rotates in the direction Y or when the second race 304 rotates in the direction X.<br>
Tiie inner surface 308 of the second race 304 urges the first rockers 318 to rotate<br>
in a direction opposite to the first direction C, and the arms 323 move out of the<br>
pockets 312 of the second race 304. This disengagement by the first rockers<br>
318 allows the first race 302 and the second race 304 to rotate freely with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
16<br><br>
[0055] Torque is also transmitted through the third clutch assembly<br>
300 when the second race 304 and the third race 306 are rotationally fixed<br>
together by the second rockers 324. Engagement of the second rockers 324 to<br>
the third race 306 occurs when the second race 304 rotates in the direction Y or<br>
when The third race 306 rotates in the direction X. Specifically, the second<br>
rockers 324 are biased to rotate in the second direction D such that the arms 327<br>
engage the pockets 319 of the third race 306. This engagement by the second<br>
rockers 324 rotationally fixes the second race 304 and the third race 306<br>
together. Disengagement of the second rockers 324 to the third race 306 occurs<br>
when the second race 304 rotates in the direction X or when the third race 306<br>
rotates in the direction Y. Specifically, the inner surface 319 of the third race<br>
urges the second rockers 324 to rotate in a direction opposite to the second<br>
direction D such that the arms 327 move out of the pockets 319 of the third race<br>
306. This disengagement by the second rockers 324 allows the second race 304<br>
and the third race 306 to rotate freely with respect to one another. When the<br>
selector ring 330 is moved to the first position, as noted above, the tabs 332<br>
prevent the second rockers 324 from rotating to engage the third race 306. The<br>
selector ring 330 thereby prevents transmission of torque between the second<br>
race 304 and the third race 306.<br>
[0056] The third clutch assembly 300 allows torque to be selectively<br>
transmitted to a first component (not shown), a second component (not shown)<br>
or a third component (not shown). These components may be coupled to the<br>
first race 302, the second race 304, and/or the third race 306 in any combination.<br>
17<br><br>
These; components (not shown) may be rotatable or fixed. For example, a first<br>
shaft may be coupled to the first race 302, and a second shaft coupled to the<br>
second race 304, and a third shaft coupled to the third race 306. Torque is<br>
transferable between the first and second shafts and between the second and<br>
third shafts using the third clutch assembly 300.<br>
[0057] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
