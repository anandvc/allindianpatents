				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
INVERTER MANUFACTURING METHOD AND INVERTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an inverter which is constituted by a thin film transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer as a channel layer. Moreover, the present invention relates to an integrated circuit which contains the relevant inverter.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
TFT (thin film transistor) backplanes in which TFTs are arranged like an array on the substrates are the backbone parts for various kinds of active matrix displays such as a liquid crystal display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display and the like. In the active matrix display, the TFT drives an electro-optic device corresponding to each pixel to display a desired content. As the TFT for such a purpose, a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) TFT, a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFT, and the like are considered.<br>
Further, a technique for simultaneously )   manufacturing TFTs respectively having different<br>
functions on the same substrate as the TFT backplane is considered. More specifically, in this technique, the<br><br>
TFT (pixel circuit) for driving the electro-optic device of each pixel and the peripheral circuits such as a gate driver, a source driver and the like constituted by TFTs are simultaneously manufactured on the same substrate. In this case, since the function of the TFT is different with respect to each of the circuit blocks such as the pixel circuit, the peripheral circuit and the like, it is desirable to adjust a threshold voltage of the TFT for each circuit block. For example, it should be noted that a large threshold voltage suitable for an inverting threshold of the electro-optic device is desired in the pixel circuit, and a small threshold voltage is desired for suppressing power consumption in the peripheral circuit. Against such a background, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2005-072461 discloses a method of adjusting threshold voltages of the TFTs according to pixel blocks in LTPS TFT circuits fabricated using excimer laser anneal (ELA).<br>
I        The peripheral circuits include digital circuits such as a shift register and the like. Here, it should be noted that, in case of manufacturing the digital circuit by TFTs, the following four constitutions (1) to (4) can be employed as a NOT element (inverter).<br>
3   That is, the constitution (1) is a resistive load, the constitution (2) is an enhancement-enhancement (E/E), the constitution (3) is an enhancement-depletion (E/D),<br><br>
and the constitution (4) is a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS). Generally, the E/D constitution or the CMOS constitution is frequently applied with the objective of reducing a layout area and achieving a high-speed operation. Incidentally, to efficiently operate the E/D inverter, it is necessary to control the threshold voltage of the TFT so as to make a difference between the threshold voltages of the two TFTs constituting the inverter sufficiently large. On the other hand, since both an n-channel TFT and a p-channel TFT are necessary for the CMOS inverter, the respective doping processes for each TFT are required, resulting in a greater number of photolithography processes as compared with other constitutions<br>
Incidentally, as candidates for high-performance TFTs to be used instead of the LTPS TFTs or the a-Si:Hs, TFTs (oxide TFTs) in which oxide semiconductor layers are used as the channel layer have been actively researched and developed. Here, a manufacturing method of an oxide TFT by using an RF-magnetron sputter thin film of amorphous In-Ga-Zn-0 (IGZO) as the channel layer is disclosed in the document "Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 112123 (2006)". Many kinds of high-mobility oxide semiconductor such as the amorphous IGZO and the like have n-type (electron) conductivity, but do not come to have p-type (hole) conductivity even by doping, whereby the CMOS constitution cannot be used. However, the<br><br>
oxide TFT has the following two advantages. That is, (1) the mobility of the oxide TFT is extremely higher than the mobility of the a-Si:H TFT. For this reason, the document "IEEE Elec. Dev. Lett., 28, p. 273 (2007)" discloses that, even if a saturation load E/E constitution inverter which is inconvenient in the point of an operation speed is used, a high-speed operation which exceeds the a-Si:H TFT inverter can be achieved.  Further, (2) sputter-deposition is available for the channel layer. Thus, since a mother glass substrate can be enlarged, the reduction in manufacturing cost according to the enlargement of the substrate can be expected.<br>
Also, various methods of controlling the threshold voltage for the oxide TFT are disclosed in the following documents. First, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2006-0113565 discloses a TFT which includes In, Ga, Zn and 0 as its constituent elements and uses, as the channel layer, a transparent amorphous oxide thin film of which the electron carrier density is less than 10^Â® cm"^, and an integrated circuit which uses the relevant TFTs.  Further, this document mentions a use of a depletion (D) type TFT, but does not mention a concrete method of controlling Vth in the TFT.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2006-<br>
0244107 discloses a method of, in a TFT which uses zinc oxide (ZnO) as the channel layer, controlling Vth by<br>
doping into a channel layer deposition atmosphere.<br><br>
Further, the document 'BARQUINHA ET AL: "Influence of the semiconductor thickness on the electrical properties of transparent TFTs based on indium zinc oxide" JOURNAL OF NONÂ¬CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS, NORTH-HOLLAND PHYSICS PUBLISHING. AMSTERDAM, NL, vol. 352, no. 9-20, 15 June 2006 (2006-06-15), pages 1749-1752, XP005482522 ISSN: 0022-3093 figure 3" discloses that, in a TFT which uses ZnO as the material of the channel layer, Vtn is controlled by the thickness of a deposited channel layer.<br>
Furthermore, the document "Journal of Applied physics, 97, p.064505 (2005)" discloses that, in a TFT which uses zinc indium oxide (Zn-In-O) an   the material of the channel layer, V^h is controlled by a heat treatment temperature.<br>
In any case, all of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2006-0244107, the document "Solid State Electronics, 352(9-20), p.1749 (2006)" and the document "Journal of Applied physics, 97, p.064505 (2005)" disclose that the characteristics of the TFTs respectively manufactured on the different substrates in different conditions are mutually different. However, none of these documents disclose a concrete method of manufacturing the TFTs each having different Vth are manufactured on the same substrate.<br>
In the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-072461, it is difficult to inexpensively manufacture a TFT digital circuit due to the following two reasons. First, the TFT disclosed in this document is an LTPS TFT. In other words, since<br><br>
the cost increases because the ELA device itself is enlarged even if the mother glass substrate is enlarged, the advantage of manufacturing cost according to the enlargement of the substrate is small. Second, it is impossible to obtain the E/D inverter that effectively operates, since the difference in the TFT threshold voltages acquired in the method disclosed in this document is too small. For this reason, the inverter disclosed in this document has the CMOS constitution, and the photolithography process is complicated as compared with other constitutions, whereby the cost increases.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention aims to solve the above-described problem. The present invention is characterized by a method of manufacturing au enhancement-depletion (E/D) inverter having plural thin film transistors formed on a same substrate, the channel layers of the said transistors being composed of an oxide semiconductor including at least one element selected from In, Ga and Zn, and the method comprising the steps of: forming a first transistor and a second transistor, thicknesses of the channel layers of the first and second transistors being mutually different; and executing heat treatment to at least one of the channel layers of. the first and second<br><br>
transistors.<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized by a method of manufacturing an enhancement-depletion (E/D) inverter having plural thin film transistors formed on a same substrate, the channel layers of the said transistors being composed of an oxide semiconductor including at least one element selected from In, Ga and Zn, and the method comprising the steps of: forming a common deposition film acting as the channel layer of a first transistor and the channel layer of a second transistor; and executing heat treatment by applying more heat to either one of the channel layer of the first transistor and the channel layer of the second transistor.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is characterized in that, from among plural oxide semiconductor thin film transistors which are formed on a same substrate and each of which includes at least one element selected from In, Ga and Zn, thicknesses of )   channel layers of at least the two transistors are<br>
mutually different, and threshold voltages of the two transistors are mutually different.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to relatively easily manufacture the oxide 3   semiconductor thin film transistors respectively having different threshold voltages on the same substrate by using the characteristics of the oxide semiconductor<br><br>
i.hin tilrn transistor. For example, the relevant characteristics include the characteristic that a difference in the threshold voltages occurs due to a difference in the thicknesses of the channel layers, and the characteristic that a difference in the threshold voltages occurs due to a difference in the heat treatment conditions of the channel layers. Even if either of these two characteristics is used, it is possible to sufficiently enlarge the difference in the threshold voltages, whereby the E/D inverter operates effectively.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A circuit diagram of an E/D inverter which can be fabricated by the present invention is indicated in FIG. )   1. One piece of enhancement type (E-type) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) and one piece of depletion type (D-type) TFT are used in the E/D inverter. The power<br><br>
I<br>
supply voltage is supplied from the external as potential difference between Vdd and GND. A source electrode of the D-type TFT and a drain electrode of the E-type TFT are connected with each other, and a gate electrode of the D-type TFT is connected with the source electrode of the D-type TFT. A drain electrode of the D-type TFT is connected with the power supply voltage Vdd terminal and a source electrode of the E-type TFT is connected to the ground. And, a gate electrode of the E-type TFT is set to serve as an input nodeterminal and the drain electrode of the E-type TFT is set to serve as an output terminal.<br>
In principle, the output voltage of the E/D inverter at a time of the "high" output rises to the voltage equivalent to the power supply voltage. Therefore, the E/D inverter has the feature that amplitude of the output voltage is wide and a rise time of the output voltage is quick.<br>
On the other hand, a circuit diagram of a<br>
I   saturated load E/E inverter, where both a load TFT and a driver TFT are set to serve as the E-types, is indicated in FIG. 2. Similar to the E/D inverter, the power supply voltage is supplied from the external as potential difference between Vdd and GND.<br>
) When these two types of inverters are compared with each other, the E/D inverter can drive the load capacity at higher speed with larger amplitude.<br><br>
In the TFT, when a drain-source voltage (Van)   is sufficiently larger than a gate-source voltage (Vga), the TFT operates in a saturation region, and a drain-source current (Ids) is represented by the following expression.<br>
Ids = (W-Ci-u/2L) â¢ (Vg3-Vth)^	... (1)<br>
Here, reference symbol L denotes channel length (unit: ]im),   reference symbol W denotes channel width (pm), reference symbol Ci denotes gate insulator capacitance (F/cra^) , reference symbol p denotes field effect carrier mobility (cm^/Vs) and reference symbol Vth denotes a threshold voltage (V).<br>
Although there are some methods in an experimental obtaining method of. p and Vth, one of the methods will be described below. In the TFT, a square root of the current Ids during a period, while sweeping the voltage Vgs and applying the constant voltage Vds sufficiently larger than the voltage Vgs, is plotted on a graph as a function of the voltage Vgg. The p and Vth I   can be obtained from gradient and intercept of a<br>
tangent line drawn at a point of arbitrary voltage Vgs on this graph. The tangent line can be also drawn at a point of the voltage Vgs where the derivative of the foregoing plot becomes a maximum, or at a point of the )   voltage Vgs actually to be applied to the TFT.  From the latter case, it is considered that the effective p and Vth in the vicinity of the voltage Vgs can be obtained.<br><br>
One definition of the E-type and D-type TFTs will be described by exemplifying an n-channel TFT for the sake of simplification. A TFT can be called an enhancement type (E-type) TFT, if its current Ids is sufficiently small at a voltage of Vgs = 0 and therefore can be regarded as being in an OFF state.  Inversely, a TFT, which has finite Ids at a voltage of Vgg = 0 in the n-channel TFT, and to which the negative Vgs has to be applied as the reverse bias to make the TFT an OFF state, in  called a depletion type (D-t.yr)t') TFT. Equivalently, the E- and D- type TFTs can  be defined using the ON (turn-on) voltage (Von) &gt;   which is the voltage Vgs where the current Ids starts to increase while the voltage Vgs is swept from the value at which time the TFT is in an OFF state. A TFT having the positive voltage Von can be defined as the E-type and a TFT having the negative voltage Von can be defined as the D-type. And, instead of the above-mentioned definition, it can be also defined that a TFT substantially having the positive voltage Vth is the E-type and a TFT substantially having the negative voltage Vth is the D-type respectively.<br>
Although the above description was given by using the n-channel TFT, similar to the above description, various definitions concerned with the E-type and the D-type can  be considered also in a p-channel TFT.<br>
In the following, it is defined that an n-channel<br><br>
I<br>
TFT basically having the positive voltage Vth is the E-type and an n-channel TFT substantially having the negative voltage Vth is the D-type. However, also in case of using two n-channel TFTs having the positive voltage, an inverter can be also structured by treating the one side TFT as the D-type not as the E-type when there is large difference between two voltages Vth. (First Embodiment)<br>
A part of a cross sectional view of an inverter according to the first embodiment of the present invention is indicated in FIG. 3.<br>
A first TFT 901 and a second TFT 902 are fabricated on a substrate 100.<br>
The first TFT 901 includes a first gate electrode 201, an insulator layer 300, a first channel layer 401, a first drain electrode 501 and a first source electrode 601.<br>
The second TFT 902 includes a second gate electrode 202, the insulator layer 300, a second channel layer 402, a second drain elecitode 502 and a second source electrode 602.<br>
Here, the insulator layer 300 is integrally built into the first TFT 901 and the second TFT 902.  However, it may be separately built into the each TFT.<br>
The first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are connected with each other. The first gate electrode 201 is connected with the first<br><br>
source electrode 601 by a wiring (not illustrated).<br>
When the first drain electrode 501 is connected to the power supply voltage Vdd terminal and the second source electrode 602 is connected to the ground, an E/D inverter, where the second gate electrode 202 is set to serve as an input node and the second drain electrode 502 is set to serve as an output node, is provided.<br>
That is, a first transistor, which is one transistor, becomes the D-type, and a second transistor, which is the other transistor, operates as the E-type.<br>
The first channel layer 401 is thicker than the second channel layer 402. In this manner, after fabricating the channel layers having different thickness each other, the whole device is collectively processed to apply the heat in an arbitrary fabricating stage. As a result of this process, the first TFT 901 and the second TFT 902 have different values of the Vth each other.<br>
In order to adjust thickness of the channel layers 401 and 402, a dry etching process or a wet etching process may be performed after forming a common deposition film consisted of the oxide semiconductor which becomes the channel layers 401 and 402.  In this manner, if utilizing the etching process, since formation of the channel layer is achieved by only one time, a manufacturing cost can be reduced.<br>
In addition, a lift-off method can be also<br><br>
utilized. That is, the film thickness oin be also<br>
controlled by forming the channel layer -tgain upon<br>
applying t.he photoresist on an upper portion of an E-<br>
type channel layer after fabricating a channel layer,<br>
of which thickness corresponds to that of the E-type<br>
channel layer which is the second channel layer 402, on<br>
an entire surface. When flushing out the whole<br>
structure, the channel layers having two kinds of<br>
thickness can be obtained on a substrate.  In this case,<br>
it is preferable because the film thickness<br>
controllability is high every channel layer.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
A part of a cross sectional view of an inverter<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention is indicated in FIG. 4.<br>
The first TFT 901 and the second TFT 902 are I<br>
fabricated on the substrate 100.<br>
The first TFT 901 includes the first gate electrode 201, the insulator layer 300, the first channel layer 401, the first drain electrode 501 and the first source electrode 601.<br>
The second TFT 902 includes the second gate electrode 202, the insulator layer 300, the second channel layer 402, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602.<br>
The first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are connected with each other. The<br><br>
first gate electrode 201 is connected with the first source electrode 601 by a wiring (not illustrated).<br>
When the first drain electrode 501 is connected to the power supply voltage Vdd terminal and the second source electrode 602 is connected to the ground, an E/D inverter, where the second gate electrode 202 is set to serve as an input node and the second drain electrode 502 is set to serve as an output node, is provided.<br>
That is, a first transistor, which is one transistor, becomes the D-type, and a st-cond transistor, which is the other transistor, operates as the E-type.<br>
The thickness of the first channel layer 401 is approximately equal to the thickness of the second channel layer 402. The first TFT 901 and the second TFT 902 are to have different values of Vth by selectively executing a heating process to the channel layer 401 of the first TFT as compared with a process to be executed to the channel layer 402 of the second TFT.<br>
In the present invention, a fact of selectively executing a heating process means to control that the heat is locally (selectively/intensively) applied to only the specific portion (also called a region) previously fixed on the substrate. For instance, there is a method of locally heating only the specific portion. However, there is a case that a part of the heat is transmitted to a portion other than the<br><br>
specific portion when the heating process is executed to the specific portion, but in the present invention, if the influence (influence given to film quality) of the transmitted heat is in a negligible level, such the influence is allowable. It is effective to provide a cooling unit in accordance with necessity in order to suppress the influence of transmitting a part of the heat to a portion other than the specific portion when the heating process is executed to the specific portion. An optimiim value in the temperature and time to maintain each TFT varies depending on the composition or thickness of each oxide seraiconductot layer of the lirst. TFT and the second TFT.<br>
According to knowledge of the present inventors, with respect to the thermal processing condition and an effect in case of fabricating an oxide semiconductor thin film having the composition of "In (indium):Ga (gallium):Zn (zinc) = 1:0.9:0.6" with the condition to be described later, the following relationship is recognized as an example. That is, a constant effect can be obtained, for instance, by maintaining the first TFT for ten minutes or more with temperature of 200 Â°C while maintaining the second TFT with temperature equal to or less than 120 Â°C.<br>
In order to selectively heat only the first TFT, various local heating methods of utilizing the contact heating and the heating by the electromagnetic wave<br><br>
I<br>
irradiation (high frequency wave irradiation, ultraviolet ray irradiation, laser beam irradiation and the like) can be used.<br>
In the present invention, the above-mentioned electromagnetic wave includes a radio frequency wave, a high frequency wave such as a microwave, an ultraviolet ray, a visible ray, an infrared ray, an X-ray and a y-ray.<br>
In the present invention, the selective heating can be achieved by performing the induction heating of utilizing the resistivity or the specific heat in various materials and the difference in absorption coefficients in the specific wavelength.<br>
In case of performing the induction heating, since the difference in the amount of the heat becomes larger depending on a selection method on materials, it is preferable because the voltage Vth can be effectively controlled every the TFT.<br>
In addition, if utilizing the difference in absorption coefficients due to the materials, the specific TFT can be selectively heated also by the collective heating such as the heating by a flash lamp. Concretely, the substances different from structural members of an electrode corresponding to another TFT are used for structural members (gate electrode, source/drain electrodes) of an electrode of the specific TFT. By providing such the structure, the<br><br>
specific TFT can be selectively heated by performing the collective optical irradiation upon using a flash lamp or the like. This process is realized because only the electrode portion formed from the material having the high absorption coefficient selectively absorbs the optical energy to heat that portion. In particular, the optical irradiation by the flash lamp is preferable because a heating apparatus is simple.<br>
At this time, in order to control temperature of the specific TFT, the light absorbing material or the light reflecting material may be assigned to members other than the TFT structural members. In addition, in accordance with necessity, an optical system such as light focusing, projecting or scanning can be used. Furthermore, in a case that there is a risk of altering film quality due to a fact that the heat of a selectively heated portion transmits to an adjacent part, the cooling unit can be also provided in accorcidfice with necessity.<br>

Then, it is preferable that the above-mentioned physical property is at least one kind of the property to be selected from among the resistivity, the specific heat and the absorption coefficients. (Third Embodiment)<br>
As indicated in the first embodiment, after fabricating the channel layers having different thickness, the heating process condition of the first channel layer is made to be differed from that of the second channel layer as in a method described in the second embodiment when the thermal process is executed in an arbitrary fabricating process. 3        As a result of this method, the first TFT 901 and the second TFT 902 have different values of the voltage<br>
Vth.<br>
In order to operate the E/D inverter according to the present invention effectively, an appropriate range<br>
0   as  the difference between threshold voltages of two kinds of transistors will be described.  FIG. 5 is a view indicating a result of comparing the oscillation characteristic of a 31-stage ring oscillator based on the saturated load E/E inverters with the oscillation<br>
:5 characteristic of a 31-stage ring oscillator based on the E/D inverters by a SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulation method.<br><br>
Evaluation, which is obtained by altering the voltage Vth of the load TFT in each condition of a geometrical (3 ratio, a mobility ratio, the power supply voltage (V^d) and the voltage Vth of an E-type driver TFT indicated in a left side of FIG. 5, is indicated in a right side of FIG. 5. Here, the geometrical (3 ratio represents a ratio of the W (width)/L (length) ratio of the driver TFT to the W/L ratio of the load TFT. The mobility ratio is a ratio of mobility of the driver TFT to inobility of the load TFT. Note that l.hv  channel length was set to become that L = 10 ym in ail the TFTs. With respect Lo the channel width, it was set to become that W = 40 pm in the load TFTs and W = 40 &gt;
capacitance caused by such the overlap was considered.<br>
According to FIG. 5, in a case that the voltage Vth of the load TFT satisfies the relationship indicated by an expression (2) for the power supply voltage Vdd 0   supplied to the inverter, E/D inverter has a merit of at least either the oscillation amplitude or the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator. That is, in the each E/D inverter, it is excellent in a point at least either the switching speed or the noise margin as '.5   compared with the saturated load E/E inverter.<br>
0.7 
That is, this expression (2) indicates that the<br><br>
E/D inverter is operated by such the power supply voltage, which satisfies that the difference between threshold voltages of the first and second transistors is in a rage less than 70% and larger than 200% of the power supply voltage, is supplied.<br>
In the above-mentioned evaluation condition, in a range outside the above-mentioned inequation, there is little merit in constituting the E/D inverter. Concretely, in a case that I (Vth (Ld)-Vth (Dr) )/Vdd I  2, the inversion voltage is too high compared with the power supply voltage, and an input/output voltage range becomes narrow.<br>
Additionally, materials for structuring the TFTs to be used in the inverters according to the present invention will be described in detail. â¢ Channel Layer<br>
The oxide semiconductor materials are used for tho chcitmel layer. Concretely, ZnO, In.iOs, GasOs and a mixed crystal thereof or an amorphous solid solution (In-Zn-0, In-Ga-Zn-0 or the like) can be used.  That is, the oxide semiconductor which includes at least one element selected from among In, Ga and Zn can be used.<br>
Specifically, if an In-Ga-Zn-0 film is formed as a channel layer of the TFT by a sputtering method, a<br><br>
transistor having the sufficiently large electric field effect mobility can be fabricated. In this case, since the deposition temperature of materials for the channel layer is low, a light-emitting device can be formed on a flexible substrate such as the plastic.<br>
Further, in the In-Ga-Zn-0 film, it is preferable that at least a part of this film includes the amorphous substance. According to this preferable structure, the performance of an etching process is improved. â¢ Source-Drain Electrodes<br>
The materials to be used for the source-drain electrodes are required that the electron injection barrier for the channel layer is sufficiently small in )   a case that the channel layer is an n-type<br>
semiconductor. In case of a p-type semiconductor, it is required that the hole injection barrier is sufficiently small. For instance, a metal such as Al, Cr, W, Ti and Au, an aluminum alloy and a silicide such 3   as WSi can be utilized. In addition, the transparent<br>
conductive oxide or the transparent oxide semiconductor having large carrier concentration can be also utilized. The indium tin oxide (ITO), the indium zinc oxide (IZO) and the In-Ga-Zn-0 film correspond to the above-5   mentioned materials.<br>
The source-drain electrodes may be formed by the coupling of plural materials or may be a multilayer<br><br>
fi ini of jVlural materials. â¢ Gate Electrode<br>
Tin.! materials to be used for the <j.ite electrode are selected from the group of materials similar to that above-mentioned source-drain electrodes and used. various metal thin films conductive oxide organic can be utilized. used for selective heating by utilizing difference in physical property such as resistivity specific heat these or absorption coefficients wavelength. note channel unit achieved also electrodes. i gate may formed coupling plural a multilayer film materials.></j.ite>
A flat film is formed on a gate insulator layer, and it is required that the materials have the small D   conductivity. Concretely, a gate-source leak current<br>
Igs is required to be sufficiently small in practical as compared with a drain-source leak current Ids.<br>
The film is selected f.rom among SiOx, SiNx and SiOxNy formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 5   method, SiOa, SiN^, SiOxNy, AI2O3, Y2O3, Hf02 and TaaOj formed by an RF magnetron sputtering method and a multilayer film composed of these materials. As<br><br>
illustrated in FIG. 3, the film may be shared by two or more than TFTs or may be an individual film distinguished every TFT.<br>
When the E/D inverter is fabricated by two kinds of TFTs, two threshold voltages of Vth are not always required to be in such a relation that the one is negative voltage and the other is positive voltage is kept, in case of being built in a circuit. Even if the two kinds of TFTs are E-types or D-types, in a case that the two threshold voltages of Vth ci\e  sufficiently Hepardtfd each other and the two TFTs c:<im be distinguishably utilized from a viewpoint: of the circuit design present invention can applied.></im>
Furthermore, also in case of fabricating three or more kinds of TFTs, in which threshold voltages of Vth can be distinguished each other, the .present invention can be similarly applied.<br>
The physical property of an amorphous In-Ga-Zn-0 film to be used as the channel layer of the TFT is evaluated.<br>
As a substrate on which a film is formed, a degreased cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) was prepared. As the target material, a polycrystalline sintered body (size: diameter 98 mm, thickness 5 mm) having the InGa03(ZnO) composition was used.<br>
This sintered body was fabricated by the wet<br><br>
blending process of In203:Ga203: ZnO (4N reagent each, solvent: methanol), a pre-sintering process (at 1000 Â°C for two hours), a dry grinding process and a main sintering process (at 1500 Â°C for two hours) as the starting material.<br>
The electric conductivity of this target material is 0.25 (S/cm), which indicated the semi-insulation condition.<br>
The background pressure in a deposition chamber is 3 X 10"' Pa, and the total pressure during deposition (namely, film formation) was set as 0.53 Pa by the oxygen-argon mixture gas which includes oxygen of 3,3 vol%.<br>
The substrate temperature is not intentionally controlled, and distance between the target material and the substrate on which the film is formed was 80 mm. The applied electric power was RF300W and a film was formed with a deposition rate of 2 (A/s).<br>
For a 60 nm-thick deposited film, an X-ray is Incident to a surface to be measured at an incident angle of 0.5 degrees and the X-ray di 11 i act: Lon .'â rieasurtiniont was performed by a thin film method. As a result, since an obvious diffraction peak was not confirmed, it was judged that the fabricated In~Ga-Zn-0 film is amorphous.<br>
As a result of an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, a metal composition ratio of the thin film<br><br>
was indicated by an expression of In:Ga:Zn = 1:0.9:0.6.<br>
After performing the measurement of two terminals I-V by a coplanar-type electrode pattern of using a evaporated multilayer film of Ti and Au, when the electric conductivity of the thin film was measured, it was about 7 x lO"^ (S/cm). If it is assumed that the electron mobility is about 5 (cm^/Vs), it is estimated that the electron carrier concentration is about 10^' (cm'"^) .<br>
According to the above inspection, it was confirmed that a fabricated In-Ga-Zn-O system thin film includes In, Ga  and Zn and at least a part of the thin film is an amorphous oxide.<br>
Hereinafter, the substance for forming a channel layer to be fabricated includes the In, Ga and Zn and at least a part of the substance is an amorphous oxide.<br>
It is allowed that the metal composition ratio is not the above-mentioned ratio of In:Ga:Zn = 1:0.9:0.6.<br>
Then, plural TFTs are respectively fabricated on I   different four substrates by the following procedure, and specimens 1 to 4 are prepared. A cross sectional view of the TFT fabricated in each of the specimens 1 to 4 is indicated in FIG. 6.<br>
The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation )   product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100, and Ti and Au are evaporated on this substrate 50 nm in total by an electron beam evaporation method and then the<br><br>
patterning is performed by a lift-oft" method, thereby obt.i i iiirK! the gate electrode 200. Next, i '^iO,. layer to become t;he gate insulator layer 300 is formed ^rieposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: O.L Pa, applied electric power: 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF magnetron sputtering method. An aperture is formed in a part (not illustrated) of the gate insulator layer 300 located on an upper portion of the gate electrode 200 by the etching, and a contact hole used for contacting with the gate electrode 200 was obtained. Subsequently, an amorphous IGZO (In-Ga-Zn-0) layer was formed (deposition gas: Oz   (3.3 vol%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) by the RF magnetron sputtering method as a channel layer 400. The film thickness was set as 30 nm in the specimens 1 and 2 and set as 60 nm in the specimens 3 and 4. In the course of deposition by the sputtering method, the substrate temperature was not specially )   controlled.<br>
Subsequently, the channel layer 400 was patterned in a predetermined channel size by the etching.<br>
Subsequently, the specimens 2 and 4 were entirely and uniformly heated on a hot plate, of which 5   temperature was set as 300 Â°C,   for twenty minutes in the air atmosphere. This thermal process was not executed to the specimens 1 and 3.<br><br>
At last, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method and then a drain electrode 500 and a source electrode 600 were formed by the lift-off method. The TFTs, of which channel width W are 4 0 jam and 200 pm or 800 ]im,   were fabricated in the respective specimens. The channel length L was set as L = 10 pm for the respective specimens.<br>
The Idg-Vgs characteristics measured at a voltage of Vds = -^10 V in these specimens are indicated in FIGS. 7A to 7H. All of these characteristics obviously indicate' the n-channel TFT character! st i.;Â« ,<br>
When the electric field effect moliility p and the threshold voltage Vth are calculated, the following 1   result was obtained.<br>
Specimen 1 (channel layer thickness d = 30 nm, a thermal process is not executed)<br>
W = 4 0 jam: u = 6.5, Vth = +3.5<br>
W - 800 ym: \i =  2.0, Vth = +3.4 )        Specimen 2 (channel layer thickness d = 30 nm, a thermal process is executed)<br>
W = 40 pm: p = 9.3, Vth = -0.23<br>
W = 800 urn: y = 7.8, Vth = +1-4<br>
Specimen 3 (channel layer thickness d = 60 nm, a 5   thermal process is not executed)<br>
W = 4 0 lam: y = 6.0, Vth = +2.1<br>
W = 200 ym: y = 4.2, Vth = +1-5<br><br>
Specimen 4 (channel layer thickness d = 60 nm, a thermal process is executed)<br>
W = 40 pm: \x =  9.7, Vtn = -10.1<br>
W = 200 pm: \x =  15,  Vtn = -3.0<br>
Both of the TFTs in the specimens 1 and 3 are E-types and the TFT in the specimen 4 is D-type.<br>
On the other hand, in the TFT having the channel width of W = 40 \im  in the specimen 2, although the voltage Vth is negative in a precise sense, it is expected that the TFT operates as the E-type TFT depending on combination of another TFT as will be indicated later.<br>
Although it was not specially described, since all the specimens are dried (120 Â°C for ten minutes) plural times in the air in the course of a fabrication process, it is considered that the change of electrical property by the application of heat under the condition matching the above-mentioned condition can be disregarded also in the time after completion of the specime.'is.<br>
The inverters as in the following respective ernbodunents are fabricated on the bayj.'f ot   the above-:r,<br>
The present embodiment 1 is an example of utilizing the first embodiment. A fabrication process of an E/D inverter using an oxide semiconductor thin<br><br>
film transistor in the Embodiment 1 is indicated in FIG. 8.<br>
The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this substrate by a first photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and then the patterning is performed by the lift-off method, thereby obtaining the first gate electrode 201 and the second gate electrode 202.<br>
Next, the SiOa layer to become the gate insulator layer 300, which is common to the first TFT and the second TFT, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: 0.1 Pa, applied electric power: 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF magnetron sputtering method. After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by a second photolithography process, a part of the gate )   insulator layer 300 located on upper portions of the<br>
gate electrodes 201 and 202 is patterned by the etching, and a contact hole (not illustrated) is obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the amorphous IGZO film 400 (common deposition film) to become a channel layer composed of 5   an oxide semiconductor is formed (deposition gas (i.e., film formation gas): O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure (i.e., film formation pressure): 0.53 Pa,<br><br>
applied electric power: 300 W) by the RF magnetron sputturmg method. A film, of which thli'knesy is 60 nm, J s farmed on both portions correspondinq (:o the tespâ¬;ctiv'<j channel layers of the first at.d s tfts. r supstrate temperature is not apecialiy controlled in course deposition by sputtering method.></j>
Subsequently, the photoresist (not illustrated) is formed on an upper portion of the amorphous IGZO film 400 in a region 801, where the first TFT is formed, by a third photolithography process and then the amorphous IGZO film 400 is dry etched. The etching is performed while adjusting time and intensity in order that the thickness of the amorphous IGZO film 400 in a region 802, where the second TFT is formed, becomes 30 nm.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) by a fourth photolithography process, the amorphous IGZO film 400 is etched to divide the amorphous IGZO )   film in order that the channel layer becomes an<br>
independent layer every transistor. In this manner, the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402 are obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the whole structure is uniformly 5   heated on a hot plate, of which temperature was set as 300 Â°C, for twenty minutes in the air atmosphere.<br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not<br><br>
illustrated) by a fifth photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Then, the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At this time, the first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are integrally formed as in FIG. 8 and electrically connected with each other.  In addition, the first source electrode 601 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by simultaneously forming .m   Interlayer wiring (iiot illustrated) via the above-motii i oned 
Note that the photolithography processes are<br>
)   executed five times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the E/D inverter fabricated by the above-mentioned procedure, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of E/D inverters<br>
5   characterized in that each of the TFTs having width of W = 40 lira in the specimen 4 is set as a load TFT and each of the TFTs having width of W = 200 jam in the<br><br>
i<br>
I<br>
specimen 2 is set as a driver TFT, was performed.  For the simulation, a Level 1 (n-channel type MOS) model of a gradual channel, which is the most simple MOS model, was used. As a result, the 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated with 470 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V. The delay time was 0.21 ^is. The amplitude is 8.0 V, and a maximum value +9.7 V of the output voltage approximates the power supply voltage of +10 V. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 9.<br>
In this Embodiment 1, the E/D inverter can be simply structured by only increasing the photolithography process one time for a fabrication process of the saturated load E/E inverter indicated in a Comparative Example 1-1. (Comparative Example 1-1)<br>
Although the present fabrication method is similar to that in the Embodiment 1, two kinds of TFTs are fabricated on the same substrate without executing a process of adjusting layer thickness of the both channel layers to have different thickness. That is, â¢  the two kinds of TFTs are fabricated on the same<br>
substrate under a state that channels ol tlie both TFTs lidve iht; same film thickness of 30 nm ,Â«!(;:l w.lt.n a ttibrication method also having the same heating process I   condition. Then the saturated load E/E inverter can be fabricated. A process flow related to the above is indicated in FIG. 10.<br><br>
i The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation<br>
product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this substrate by the first photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and then the patterning is performed by the lift-off method, thereby obtaining the first gate electrode 201 and the second gate electrode 202.<br>
Next, the SiOa layer to become the gate insulator layer 300, which is common to the first TFT and the second TFT, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: 0.1 Pa, applied electric power: 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF )   magnetron sputtering method. After forming the<br>
photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by the second photolithography process, the gate insulator layer 300 is patterned by the etching, and a contact hole (not illustrated) is obtained on upper portions of 3   the gate electrodes 201 and 202.<br>
Subsequently, the amorphous IGZO film is formed (deposition gas: O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) by the RF magnetron sputtering method as the channel layer 5   400. A film, of which thicJcness is 30 nm, is formed on both portions corresponding to the respective channel layers of the first TFT and the second TFT. The<br><br>
substrate temperature is not specially controlled in the course of the deposition by the sputtering method.<br>
Al'ter forming the photoresist (not: illustrated) by the tlii.rd photolithography process, tl-o fhannel layer ^Ou is etched, and the first chantvl layer 4 03 ,Â»i;d t.iit: :3t;corid channel layer 402 die obt.tined.<br>
Subsequently, the whole structure is uniformly heated on a hot plate, of which temperature was set as 300 Â°C, for twenty minutes in the air atmosphere.<br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not illustrated) by the fourth photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Then, the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At the same time, the first drain electrode 501 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by forming an interlayer wiring (not illustrated) via the above-mentioned contact hole.<br>
The first source electrode 601 is integrated with the second drain electrode 502.<br>
According to the above, a saturated load E/E inverter, in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electrode 602 is regarded as an ground node, is completed. The photolithography processes are executed<br><br>
four times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated by the above-mentioned procedure, the following circuit simulation was performed. That is, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of the saturated load E/E inverters characterized in that each of the TFTs having width of W = 40 pm in the specimen 2 is set as a load TFT and each of the TFTs having width of W = 200 \im  in the specimen 2 is set as a driver TFT, was performed. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 11. The 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated at 350 kHz cit the external power .'jupply voltage of +10 V. The dnlrty i imt! per one stage i;. 0.29 ys, which was extended toity percent as compared with the Embodiment 1.  The amfflitude is 5.5 V, and a maximum value of the output voltage is +7.1 V, which decreased about 3 V for the power supply voltage of +10 V.<br>
That is, the E/D inverter in the Embodiment 1 operates at higher speed with larger amplitude than the saturated load E/E inverter in the present comparative example. And, according to the fabrication method in the Embodiment 1, it can be expected that an inverter more excellent than that in the comparative example 1-1 can be obtained.<br>
Note that the voltage Vth of the TFT having width<br><br>
of W = 40 pm in the specimen 2 is slightly negative to 0 V in a precise sense. However, it is important to be an approximate value with the voltage Vth of the TFT having width of W = 200 pm in the specimen 2, and the load TFT having width of W = 40 ym in the specimen 2 can be substantially regarded as an E-type in this combination.<br>
And, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, in which each of the TFTs having width of W = 40 pm in the specimen 4 is regarded as the load TFT and each of the TFTs having width of W = 200 pm in the specimen 4 is treated as the driver TFT, was also performed. The oscillation could not be found in any case that the inverter is the E/D invert Â»Â»r or the .sat:urat;ed load E/E inverter. I (:om})arcir I ve Example 1-2)<br>
A fabrication method of an E/D inverter similar to that in the above-mentioned Embodiment 1 based on a channel layer forming method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-165532 is considered. In a method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-165532, the voltage Vth is controlled by the concentration of the nitric monoxide flowed into the ZnO deposition atmosphere.  In case of fabricating a TFT having two kinds of voltages Vth on  the same substrate, a process of forming the separate channel layers having different doping<br><br>
concentration is required in order to obtain a first channel layer and a second channel layer respectively.<br>
The E/D inverter can be fabricated with the following process similar to that in the Comparative Example 1-1. A fabricating process will be described by using FIG. 12.<br>
The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this substrate by the first photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and then the patterning is performed by the lift-off method, thereby obtaining the first gate electrode 201 and the second gate electrode )   202.<br>
Next, the SiOa layer to become the gate insulator<br>
layer 300, which is common to the first Tt'T and the<br>
second TFT, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition<br>
pressure: 0.1 Pa, applied electric power; 400 W, film<br>
0   thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF<br>
magnetron sputtering method. After forming the<br>
photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by<br>
the second photolithography process, tin} qate insulator<br>
layer 300 is patterned by the etching, iud  a contact<br>
'i	hole (nut illustrated) is obtained on npiJer portions of<br>
region-s (not illustrated) of the qate Â»'le(:;trodes 201 and 202.<br><br>
Subsequently, a ZnO layer to become the first channel layer 401 is formed by a pulse laser deposition method. The intentional doping is not performed to the first channel layer 401. The photoresist (not illustrated) is formed by the third photolithography process and the patterning is performed by the etching, and the first channel layer 401 is obtained. Additionally, a ZnO layer to become the .second channel layer 4 02 is formed by the pulse laser (lÂ«!po.si t. ion method with the similar procedure. At tliis time, the nitrogen is doped into the second channel, layer 402 by setting the deposition atmosphere to the mixture gas of oxygen and nitric monoxide. The photoresist (not illustrated) is formed by the fourth photolithography &gt;        process and the patterning is performed by the etching, and the second channel layer 402 is obtained.<br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not illustrated) by the fifth photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which )   thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Then, the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At the same time, the 5   first source electrode 601 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by forming an interlayer wiring (not illustrated) via the above-mentioned contact hole.<br><br>
The first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are integrally formed.<br>
According to the above, an E/D inverter, in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electrode 602 is regarded as an ground node, is completed. Note that a protection layer may be appropriately formed on this completed inverter continuously, and the difference between the voltage Vth of the first transistor 901 and the voltage Vth of the second transistor 902 may be more preferably adjusted.<br>
The photolithography processes with the above-mentioned procedure are executed five times, which is equal to the processing number of times in the Embodiment 1.<br>
However, the fabrication of the inverter with the above-mentioned procedure is actually ditiicult, and the photolithography processes are required at least six times, which is increased one time ioi   the case in the Embodiment 1.<br>
As a  reason for the above, the following two points are enumerated.<br>
A first point problem is as mentioned below. When forming the second channel layer 402, the first channel layer 401 also enters in a deposition chamber.  In the above-mentioned method, it can not be avoided that the first channel layer 401 is put in the deposition<br><br>
I<br>
atmosphere in the course of forming the second channel layer 402. As a result, it is not preferable because there is a risk that the electric property of the first channel layer 401 varies before or after the formation of the second channel layer 402. In order to prevent this situation, in case of providing some sort of sealing layer (photoresist or SiNx sputtering film) on the first channel layer 401 to protect the first channel layer 401 from the deposition atmosphere of the second channel layer 402, the photolithography process is further required.<br>
A second point problem is as mentioned below. In case of patterning the second channel layer 402 by the etching after patterning the first channel layer 401, an etching selection ratio of the latter layer to the former layer becomes important in order that the former layer is not encroached by the etching of the latter layer. However, the difference between the structural components of the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402 is only the contained amount of dopant, and it is considered that the etching selection ratio approximates to one. Therefore, in order to perform the assured etching,- an etching protection layer has to be provided on the region 801 where the first TFT is formed. Also, in this case, the photolithography process is further required.<br>
Consequently, a fabrication method of the present<br><br>
iiiveni-ion is able to fabricate the E/D niveitej. by a simple niet hod with the processing number of times less than that in an E/D inverter fabrication method applied to the conventional technology. <embodiment><br>
A case of using the lift-off method in a channel layer forming portion in the Embodiment 1 will be indicated in the Embodiment 2. The related process will be described by using FIG. 8 again.<br>
After obtaining a contact hole by a method similar to that in the Embodiment 1, the amorphous IGZO film 400 to become a part of the channel layer is continuously formed (deposition gas: O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) by the RF magnetron sputtering method. A film, of which thickness is 30 nm, is formed for the same thickness on both portions corresponding to the respective channel layers of the first TFT and the second TFT. The substrate temperature is not specially controlled in the course of the deposition by the sputtering method.<br>
Subsequently, the photoresist (not illustrated) is formed on an upper portion of the amorphous IGZO film 400 in the region 802, where the second TFT is formed, by a third photolithography process. The photoresist is suitably thermally processed, and it is preferable to increase the tolerance for the sputtering<br><br>
damage in the subsequent process. The amorphous JGZO film, of which thickness is 30 nm, is formed again as remainder of the amorphous IGZO film 400 on this photoresist and the region 801, where the first TFT is formed, by the RF magnetron sputtering method under the similar condition. Additionally, the whole structure is rinsed by the photoresist remover solvent to remove the photoresist and the amorphous IGZO film formed on an upper portion of the photoresist, and the channel layer is deposited on only the first TFT to form the channel layer of the first TFT. At this time, channel layers having different thickness are obtained every TFT of the two TFTs as indicated in FIG. 8.<br>
Thereafter, the E/D inverter is completed by the procedure similar to that in the Embodiment 1. Note that the photolithography processes are executed five times.<br>
In this manner, in case of using the lift-off method when forming the channel layer, the similar effect to that in the Embodiment 1 can be obtained. In addition, the controllability of the channel layer thickness is excellent as compared with the Embodiment 1.<br><embodiment><br>
1	The present embodiment 3 is an example of<br>
utilizing the second embodiment. A fabricating process of the E/D inverter using an oxide thin film transistor<br><br>
in the Embodiment 3 will be indicated in FIG. 13.<br>
The indium tin oxide (ITO, dielectric constant: Ixlo^S/cm) film, of which thickness is 200 nm, is formed on the cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) by the RF magnetron , sputtering method, and the photoresist (not illustrated) is formed on this formed film by the first photolithography process. Thereafter, the patterning is performed by the etching, and the first gate electrode 201 is obtained.<br>
Subsequently, after forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this glass substrate by the second photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and the patterning is performed by the lift-off method, and the second gate electrode 202 is obtained.<br>
Next, the Si02 layer to become the gate insulator layer 300, which is common to the first TFT and the second TFT, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: 0.1 Pa, applied electric powet : 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF magnetron sputtering method. After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by the third photolithography process, the patterning is performed by the etching, and a contact hole (not illustrated) is obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the amorphous IGZO film 400 to<br><br>
become the channel layer is formed (deposition gas: O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) by the RF magnetron sputtering method. A film, of which thickness is 60 nm, is formed on both portions corresponding to the respective channel layers of the first TFT and the second TFT. The substrate temperature is not specially controlled in the course of the deposition by the sputtering method. The amorphous IGZO film 4 00 is etched to divide it in order that the channel layer becomes an independent layer every transistor. In this manner, the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402 are obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the whole structure is inductively heated. Since the resistivity of the ITO electrode is about fifty times higher than that of Au, the first gate electrode 201 is selectively heated as compared with the second gate electrode 202. The power of AC applied magnetic field, frequency and an applying time which were optimized are used. And, the deterioration of a heating selection ratio due to the heat conduction of the substrate is prevented by intermittently applying the AC magnetic field to be used for the induction heating in accordance with necessity.  It is also effective that the heat applied to the gate electrode 202 is cooled by utilizing a cooling unit such as a heat sink.<br><br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not i llust,rated) by the fifth photolithogrdphy process, Ti rwici Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Thereafter, the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At the same time, the first source electrode 601 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by forming an interlayer wiring (not illustrated) via the above-mentioned contact hole.<br>
The first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are integrally formed.<br>
According to the above, an E/D inverter, in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electrode 602 is regarded as an ground node, is completed. Note that the photolithography processes are executed five times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the E/D inverter, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of E/D inverters characterized in that the TFT having width of W = 40 urn in the specimen 4 is set as a load TFT and the TFT having width of W = 200 \im.  in the specimen 3 is set as a driver TFT, was performed.<br>
As a result, the 5-stage ring oscillator<br><br>
oscillated with 390 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V. The delay time was 0.26 ps. The amplitude is 5.5 V, and a maximum value of the output voltage per one stage was +9.0 V, which decreased 1.0 V from the power supply voltage of +10 V. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 14.<br>
In the present embodiment, the E/D inverter can be simply structured by only increasing the photolithography process one time for a fabricating process of the saturated load E/E invert
Alternatively, the same material may be used for materials of structuring the source, drain and gate electrodes in these two kinds of TFTs. Even if such the structure is adopted and the channel layer having the same thickness was formed, an effect similar to that in the Embodiment 3 can be obtained, as long as only the vicinity of the first channel layer 401 is intensively heated by the contact heating or a laser annealing method at a time of executing the heating process of the channel layer.<br>
In this case, the photolithography processing number of times can be reduced one time.<br>
However, the device can be simplified and the controllability is improved as in the Embodiment 3, if the induction heating is performed by fabricating the TFT which includes the different materials for<br><br>
structuring the source, drain and gate electrodes or if applying the heat by a flash lamp by Utilizing the difference in absorption coefficients due to materials.<br>
In the present Embodiment 3, the induction heating is performed by using different materials for the gate electrodes in the two kinds of transistors. However, an effect similar to that in the Embodiment 3 can be obtained by also performing the induction heating by using different materials for electrodes other than the gate electrode such as a source or drain electrode of the first transistor or the corresponded electrode in the second transistor. (Comparative Example 3-1)<br>
Although the present fabrication method is similar to that in Embodiment 3, the two kinds of TFTs are fabricated on the same substrate by setting the thickness of the both channel layers as 60 nm in a manner that the selective heating for the first channel layer 401 is not performed and the heating processes for the channels of the both TFTs are not performed. Then t.he saturated load E/E inverter cn!\  be   tabricated by using the photolithography processes four times similar to the Comparative Example 1-1 In the Embodiment 1.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the saturated load E/E inverter, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is<br><br>
composed of saturated load E/E inverters characterized in that the TFT having width of W = 40 jam in the specimen 3 is set as a load TFT and the TFT having width of W = 200 \im  in the specimen 3 is set as a driver TFT, was performed. As a result, the 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated with 150 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V, and the amplitude was 4.4 V. The delay time per one stage was 0.66 \is,   which was extended about two and half times for the Embodiment 3. A maximum value of the output voltage is about +6 V, which considerably decreased as compared with the Embodiment 3. That is, the E/D inverter in the Embodiment 3 operates at a higher speed with larger amplitude than the saturated load E/E inverter in this comparative example. Therefore, according to the fabrication method in the Embodiment 3, it can be expected that an inverter more excellent than that in this comparative example can be obtained. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 15. <embodiment><br>
The present embodiment 4 is an example of utilizing the third embodiment. A fabricating process of the E/D inverter using an oxide semiconductor thin film transistor in the Embodiment 4 will be indicated in FIG. 8.<br>
The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100.<br><br>
Af;t.er forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this qlass substrate by the first photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and then the patterning is performed by the lift-off method, thereby obtaining the first gate electrode 201 and the second gate electrode 202.<br>
Next, the SiOz layer to become the gate insulator layer 300, which is common to the first and second TFTs, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: 0.1 Pa, applied electric power: 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF magnetron sputtering method. After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by the second photolithography process, a part of the gate insulator layer 300 located on upper portions of the first gate electrode 201 and the second gate electrode 202 is patterned by the etching, and a contact hole (not illustrated) is obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the amorphous IGZO film 400 to become the channel layer, is formed (deposition gas: O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) by the, RF magnetron sputtering method. A film, of which thickness is 60 nm, is formed on both portions corresponding to the respective channel layers of the first TFT and the second TFT. The substrate temperature is not specially controlled<br><br>
in the course of the deposition by the sputtering method.<br>
Subsequently, the photoresist (not illustrated) is formed on an upper portion of the amorphous IGZO film 400 in a region 801, where the first TFT is formed, by the third photolithography process and then the amorphous IGZO film 400 is dry etched. The etching is performed while adjusting time and intensity in order that the thickness of the amorphous IGZO film 400 in a region 802, where the second TFT is formed, becomes 30 nm.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not i 1 l.ustrated) by the fourth photolithography process, the amorphous [GZO film 400 is etched to divide it in order that the channel layer becomes an independent layer every transistor.  In this manner, the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402 are obtained.<br>
Subsequently, only the vicinity of the first channel layer 401 is intensively heated by the focused laser beam. At this time, although it was not hot as in the first channel layer 401, the second channel layer 402 is slightly heated due to the heat conduction of the substrate.<br>
However, as confirmed by indicating the graphs in FIGS. 7A to 7H, since variation of the voltage Vth of the TFT using the second channel layer is small before and after the heating as compared with the TFT using<br><br>
the first channel layer, it is treated that the heating process is not performed to the channel layer 402.<br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not illustrated) by the fifth photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Thereafter, the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At this time, the first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode 502 are integrally formed as in FIG. 8 and electrically connected with each other.  In addition, the first source electrode 601 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by simultaneously forming an interlayer wiring (not illustrated) via the above-mentioned contact hole together with the source-drain electrodes.<br>
According to the above, an E/D inverter, in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electiv)de 602 is regarded as an ground node, is complefcd. Note that the photolithography processes are executed five times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the E/D inverter fabricated by the above-mentioned procedure, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of E/D inverters<br><br>
characterized in that the TFT having width of W = 40 \im in  the specimen 4 is set as a load TFT and the TFT having width of W = 800 )jm in the specimen 1 is set as a driver TFT, was performed.<br>
As a result, the 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated with 114 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V. The delay time was 0.88 ys. The amplitude is 7.8 V, and a maximum value of the output voltage was +10 V, which is equal to the power supply voltage. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 16.<br>
In the present Embodiment 4, the E/D inverter can be simply structured with the same processing number of times of the photolithography process or by only increasing the photolithography process one time for the fabrication processes of the saturated load E/E inverters as indicated in the following comparative examples.<br>
When providing the difference in film thickness, a film thickness adjustment may be performed by the lift-off method as indicated in the Embodiment 2 without performing the etching. In this case, the film thickness controllability is improved.<br>
When providing the difference in the heating condition, the two kinds of TFTs may be fabricated by the different materials in the materials of structuring the source, drain and gate electrodes as indicated in the Embodiment 3, and the heating may be selectively<br><br>
I<br>
performed by the induction heating or the optical<br>
irradiation.<br>
(Comparative Example 4-1)<br>
All liough the present fabrication method is Mimilru lo  that in Embodiment 4,   two kinds of TFTs are fabricated on the same substrate in a manner that the selective heating for the first channel layer 401 is not performed and the heating processes for the channels of the both TFTs are not performed. Then the saturated load E/E inverter can be fabricated.<br>
Similar to the Embodiment 4 as indicated in FIG. 8, the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402, to which the film thickness difference was provided by the etching or the lift-off method, are obtained. Then, the photoresist (not illustrated) is formed by the fifth photolithography process. Thereafter, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method, and the first drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the second drain electrode 502 and the second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method.<br>
For the above-mentioned electrodes, the first gate electrode 201 is connected with the first drain electrode 501 by an external wiring (not illustrated) but is not connected with the first source electrode 601.  In this manner, the saturated load E/E inverter,<br><br>
in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electrode 602 is regarded as an ground node, can be completed. Note that the photolithography processes are executed five times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated by the above-mentioned procedure, the following circuit simulation was performed. That is, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of saturated load E/E inverters characterized in that the TFT having width of W = 40 pin in the specimen '.i   is set as a load TFT and the 'i'F'I' having width of W = 800 ym in the specimen 1 in  set as a driver TFT, was performed. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 17. The 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated with 30 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V. The delay time per one stage is 3.4 ]is,   which was extended 3.8 times for the Embodiment 4. The amplitude is 5.6V, and a maximum value of the output voltage is +6.8 V, which decreased about +3.2 V for the power supply voltage of +10 V. That is, as compared with the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated in this Comparative Example 4-1, the E/D inverter in the Embodiment 4 operates at a higher speed with larger amplitude than the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated in this Comparative Example 4-1.<br><br>
Therefore, according to the fabrication method in the Embodiment 4, it can be expected that an inverter more excellent than that in this Comparative Example 4-1 can be obtained. (Comparative Example 4-2)<br>
Although the present fabrication method is similar to that in Embodiment 4,   two kinds of TFTs are fabricated on the same substrate in a manner that a process for adjusting the both channels to have different thickness is not performed but only the heating condition is changed with a state that the channels of the both TFTs have the same thickness of 30 nm. Then the saturated load E/E inverter can be fabricated.<br>
The related fabrication process is indicated in FIG. 10.<br>
The cleaned glass substrate (Corning Corporation product 1737) is employed as the substrate 100.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this glass substrate by the first photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated 50 nm in total by the electron beam evaporation method and then the pait.erning is performed by the lift-oJ-] nict.hoti, thereby cbtaininq the first gate electrode 201 diid the second gate electrode 202.<br>
Next, the Si02 layer to become the gate insulator layer 300, which is coiranon to the first TFT and the<br><br>
second TFT, is formed (deposition gas: Ar, deposition pressure: 0,1 Pa, applied electric power: 400 W, film thickness: 100 nm) on an entire surface by the RF magnetron sputtering method. After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) on this formed film by the second photolithography process, the gate insulator layer 300 is patterned by the etching, and a contact hole (not illustrated) is obtained on upper portions of the regions of the gate electrodes 201 and 202.<br>
Subsequently, the amorphous IGZO film 400 is formed (deposition gas: O2 (3.3 VOL%) + Ar, deposition pressure: 0.53 Pa, applied electric power: 300 W) as the channel layer 400 by the RF magnetron sputtering method. A film, of which thickness is 30 nm, is formed on both portions corresponding to the respective channel layers of the first TFT and the second TFT. The substrate temperature is not specially controlled in the course of the deposition by the sputtering method.<br>
After forming the photoresist (not illustrated) by the third photolithography process, the channel layer 400 is etched, and the first channel layer 401 and the second channel layer 402 are obtained.<br>
Subsequently, only the vicinity of the second channel layer 402 is locally (selectively/intensively) heated by the focused laser beam.<br>
At last, after forming the photoresist (not<br><br>
illustrated) by the fourth photolithography process, Ti and Au are evaporated again to form a film, of which thickness is 100 nm in total, by the electron beam evaporation method. Thereafter, the fir^tt drain electrode 501, the first source electrode 601, the .'.c-con i dzain electrode 502 and thâ¬&gt; second source electrode 602 are formed by the lift-off method. At the same time, the first drain electrode 501 is connected with the first gate electrode 201 by forming an interlayer wiring (not illustrated) via the above-mentioned contact hole.<br>
Note that the first source electrode 601 and the second drain electrode. 502 are integrally formed.<br>
According to the above, the saturated load E/E inverter, in which the first drain electrode 501 is regarded as an voltage supply node and the second source electrode 602 is regarded as an ground node, is completed. The photolithography processes are executed five times.<br>
In order to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated by the above-mentioned procedure, the following circuit simulation was performed. That is, a circuit simulation of a 5-stage ring oscillator, which is composed of saturated load E/E inverters characterized in that the TFT having width of W = 40 \im  in the specimen 2 is set as a load TFT and the TFT having<br><br>
width of W = 800 pm in the specimen 1 is set as a driver TFT, was performed. An output waveform is indicated in FIG. 18. The 5-stage ring oscillator oscillated with 68 kHz at the external power supply voltage of +10 V. The delay time per one stage was 1.4 8 yis,   which was extended seventy percent as compared with the Embodiment 4. The amplitude is 6.3 V, and a maximum value of the output voltage is +8.3 V, which decreased about 1,7 V for the power supply voltage of +10 V. That is, as compared with the saturated load E/E inverter fabricated in the present Comparative Example 4-2, the E/D inverter in the Embodiment 4 operates at a higher speed with larger aiapj itude than the saturated load E/E inverter fabric:;at ^'d in the present Comparative Example 4-2. Therefore, according lo the labrication method in the Embodiment 4, it can be expected that an inverter more excellent than that in the comparative example 4-2 can be obtained. <embodiment><br>
