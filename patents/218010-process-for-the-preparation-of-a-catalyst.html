				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of catalyst with improved catalytic properties. Background of the Invention<br>
The presence of certain species contained in the carriers of catalysts can be detrimental to the catalytic metal deposition thereon and/or catalyst performance and it is commonly believed that the concentration of these detrimental species must be controlled throughout the bulk of carrier.  One way of controlling the amount of impurities through the bulk, although expensive, is by the use of purer raw materials.  For example, US Patent No. 4,797,270 discloses water washing to reduce the sodium content of an alumina powder.  The pH of the wash water may need to be adjusted for extraction of other metals and Japanese patent JP56164013 discloses the use of a low pH (acid) to extract uranium and thorium from a calcined a-aiumina raw material.<br>
Several procedures in the art teach that washing after deposition of the catalytic metal is helpful. US Patent Nos. 4,361,504 and 4,366,092 suggest that ethylene oxide catalyst be water washed after the deposition of silver or silver/gold on the carrier. EP-A 211521 discloses washing of a catalyst with hot water to remove basic materials left on the catalyst from a silver impregnation process or the physical deposition of alkali metals.  US Patent No. 4,367,167 discloses a process for preparing a supported catalyst wherein an<br><br>
impregnated support is immersed in an inert water immiscible organic solvent containing a dissolved aliphatic amine.<br>
US Patent No. 4,810,689 discloses depositing a silver compound, decomposing the silver compound to silver in the presence of an alkali metal compound, removing organic deposits by washing and introducing fresh alkali metal by impregnation during or after the washing stage.<br>
GB patent specification No. 568,978 discloses a process for preparing alumina of high stability and resistance to disintegration, comprising precipitating hydrous alumina, subjecting the precipitate to hot aging at above 125 °F to stabilize the alumina, washing the alumina, grinding, forming into pieces and heat treating the formed pieces at between 1000 and 1600 °F whereby said pieces, when they are pellets 4 mm in diameter, have a knife edge hardness of at least 3500 grams.<br>
US Patent No. 4,994,587 discloses a process for the epoxidation of alkene comprising contacting the alkene and an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of at least one efficiency-enhancing gaseous member of a redox-half reaction pair, selected from the group of NO, NC&gt;2, N2°3 and N204, and a solid catalyst, the catalyst comprising silver and at least one efficiently-enhancing nitrate salt of a member of a redox-half reaction pair, on a solid alpha-alumina support having less than about 50 ppm and preferably less than 20 ppm by weight of leachable sodium- This document further connects the requirement to relatively low sodium to the specified redox reaction pair, stating that in other instances the presence of leachable sodium in a silver catalyst tends to improve the efficiency of the system under epoxidation conditions generally used.<br><br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,186,106 and 4,125,480 disclose washing with an inert liquid after deposition of the catalytic metal and before deposition of a promoter material.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,908,343 teaches that it may be desirable to remove cations which are exchangeable with the alkali and alkaline earth metals contained in the impregnating solution, to allow for ease of repeatability in the use and reuse of the impregnating solution.  No methods are taught for such removal; however, it is commonly known in the art that acids are highly effective cation removal solutions.<br>
The prior art remains concerned with the total amount of impurities; i.e., impurities throughout the bulk. Unfortunately, the impurity removal techniques taught typically attack the carrier itself.  It has now been found that the metal deposition and/or catalytic properties of a catalyst may be greatly improved by controlling the purity of the surface of the carrier rather than the purity of the carrier bulk, such that the total amount^ of impurities may actually be high as long as the surface amounts of impurities are maintained at a low level. Summary of the Invention<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process for improving the properties of a carrier for a catalyst..by a treatment, which treatment is performed on one or more of the materials from which the<br><br>
tecnnique is no measure the change in electrical conductivity of the treatment solution.<br>
Carriers are commonly inorganic materials such as, for example, alumina-, silica-, or titania-based compounds, or combinations thereof, such as alumina- __ silica carriers.  Carriers may also be made from carbon-based materials such as, for example, charcoal, activated carbon, or fullerenes.<br>
lonizable species typically present on the inorganic type carriers include .sodium, potassium, aluminates, soluble silicate, calcium, magnesium, aluminosilicate, cesium, lithium, and combinations thereof.  Of particular concern are the lonizable anionic species present on the surface, particularly ionizable silicates.  Lowering the undesirable ionizable species concentration may be accomplished by any means (i) which is effective in rendering the ionizable species ionic and removing that species, or (ii) which renders the ionizable species<br>
insoluble, or (iii) which renders the ionizable species<br>
&gt; immobile; however, use of aggressive media is discouraged<br>
as these media tend to dissolve the carrier, extract too much material from the bulk, and generate acidic or basic sites ir. the pores.  Acids, besides being aggressive media, will remove the cations on a carrier but are fairly ineffectual in removing the undesirable anions, such as silicates.  Effective means of lowering concentration include washing the carrier; ion exchange; volatilizing, precipitating, or sequestering the impurities; causing a reaction to make the ionizable species on the surface insoluble; and combinations thereof.  Examples of wash and ion exchange solutions include aqueous and/or organic solvent-basea solutions which may also contain tetraethyiammonium hydroxide, ammoniurr. acetate, lithium caroonate, barium acetate,<br><br>
bulk carrier material, compared to a catalyst made with an untreated carrier.  Further, the process will work for organic or inorganic carriers.<br>
The process is effective in improving at least one the catalytic properties of a catalyst wherein a     _ catalytically reactive metal is deposited or impregnated upon a carrier which contains ionizable species on its surface.  "Improvement in catalytic properties" as used herein means the properties of the catalyst are improved as compared to a catalyst made from the same carrier which has not been treated to lower surface ionizable' species.  Catalytic properties include catalyst activity, selectivity, activity and/or selectivity performance over time, operability (resistance to runaway), conversion and work rate.<br>
The process requires that the concentration of undesirable icnizable species present on the surface of the carrier be reduced.  As used herein, the "surface" of the carrier is that area of the carrier which may be measured by the standard method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET).  Specifically, the surface of the carrier is the-site at which reaction takes place.  An "ionizable" species is a species which is capable of being rendered ionic, where the term "ionic" or "ion" refers to an electrically charged chemical moiety.<br>
The solubilization rate of silicates may be measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques and the amount of sodium and silicon species on a surface may be measured by x-ray photoeiectron spectrosccpy (XPS). In defining the present invention the amounts of sodium and/or silicon, present en the surface cf the carrier, as measured by XPS, before and after treatment according to the invention, have been chosen as an incicator for the amounts of ionizabie soecies . Anotner measurement<br><br>
technique is to measure the change in electrical conductivity of the treatment solution.<br>
Carriers are commonly inorganic materials such as, for example, alumina-, silica-, or titania-based compounds, or combinations thereof, such as alumina- _ silica carriers.  Carriers may also be made from carbon-based materials such as, for example, charcoal, activated carbon  or fullerenes.<br>
lonizable special - typically present on the inorganic type carriers include sodiun:, potassium, aluminates, soluble silicate, calcium, magnesium, aluminosilicate, cesium, lithium, and combinations thereof.  Of particular concern are the lonizable anionic species present on the surface, particularly ionizable silicates.  Lowering the undesirable ionizable species concentration may be accomplished by any means (i) which is effective in rendering the ionizabie species ionic and removing that species, or (ii) which renders the ionizable species<br>
insoluble, or (iii) which renders the ionizable species<br><br>
immobile; however, use of aggressive media is discouraged as these media tend to dissolve the carrier, extract too much material from the bulk, and generate acidic or basic sites in the pores.  Acids, resides being aggressive media, will remove the cations on a carrier but are fairly ineffectual in removing the undesirable anions, such as silicates.  Effective means of lowering concentration include washing the carrier; ion exchange; volatilizing, precipitating, or sequestering the impurities; causing a reaction to make the ionizable species en the surface insoluble; and combinations thereof.  Examples of wash and ion exchange solutions include aqueous and/or organic solvent-based solutions which may also contain tetraethyiammonium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, lithium carbonate, barium acetate,<br><br>
strontium acetate, crown ether, methanox, cthanoi, dimethyiformamide, ana mixtures thereof.<br>
The formed carrier may be treated, or the materials used to form the carrier may be treated before the carrier is manufactured.  When the carrier materials are treated before the carrier is formed, still further improvement may be seen by also treating the surface of the formed carrier.  The carrier may be driea following the ionizable species reduction treatment.<br>
To make a catalyst from the carrier, the carrier is typically impregnated with metal compound (s), complex(ies) and/or salt(s) dissolved in a suitable solvent sufficient to deposit or impregnate a catalyticaily effective amount of metaL on the carrier.  As used herein, " cataiyticaliy effective amount" means an amount of metal that provides a measurable catalytic effect.  For example, a catalyticaily effective amount of metal when referring to an olefin epoxidation catalyst is that amount of metal which provides a measurable conversion of oiefin and oxygen to aikylene oxide.<br>
Further improvement in the catalyst properties are seen when the metal deposition is effected by contacting the carrier with an impregnation solution whose hydrogen ion activity has been lowered. "Hydrogen ion activity" as used herein is the hydrogen ion activity as measured by the potential of a hydrogen ion selective electrode. As used herein, a solution with "lowered" hydrogen ion activity refers to a solution whose hydrogen activity has been altered by the addition of a base, such that the hydrogen ion activity of tne altered solution is lowered compared to the hydrogen ion activity of the same solution in an unaltered state.  The base selected to alter the solution may be cnosen from any base or compouna with a pKb lower than the original impregnation solution.  It is oarticuiarly desirable to choose a base<br><br>
which does not alter the formulation of the impregnation solution; i.e., which does not alter the desired metals concentration present in the impregnation solution and deposited on the carrier.  Organic bases will not alter the impregnation solution metals concentrations, examples of which are tetraalkylammonium hydroxides and 1,8-bis-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene. If changing the metals concentration of the impregnation solution is not .a concern, metal hydroxides may be used.<br>
When the impregnation solution is at least partially aqueous, an indication of the change in the hydrogen activity may be measured with a pH meter, with the understanding that the measurement obtained is not pH by a true, aqueous definition.  '"Measured pH"' as used herein shall mean such a non-aqueous system pH measurement using a standard pH probe. Even small changes in the "measured pH" from the initial impregnation solution to that with added base are effective and improvements in catalytic properties continue as the "measured pH" change increases with base addition.  High base additions do not seem to adversely affect catalyst performance; however, high additions of hydroxides have been seen to cause sludging of the impregnation solution, creating manufacturing difficulties.  When the base addition is too low, the hydrogen ion activity will not be affected.  The hydrogen ion activity lowering procedure is also quite effective when used by itself; i.e., when no ionizable species concentrations are lowered prior to impregnation.<br>
The impregnated carrier, also known as a catalyst precursor, can be dried in the presence of an atmosphere which also reduces the catalytic metal.  Drying methods known in the art include steam drying, drying in an atmosphere with a controlled oxygen concentration, drying<br><br>
in a reducing atmosphere, air drying, and staged drying using a suitable ramped or staged temperature curve.<br>
By way of example, the process will be described in more detail for a catalyst suitable for the vapor phase production of epcxides, also known as an epoxidation catalyst.<br>
First, a carrier is selected. In the case of an epoxidation catalyst the carrier is typically an inorganic material, such as for example, an alumina-based carrier such as α-alumina.<br>
In the case of a-alumina-containing carriers, -preference is given to those having a specific surface area as measured by the B.E.T. method of from 0.03 to 10 m2/g, preferably from 0.05 to about 5 m2/g, more preferably from 0.1 to 3 m2/g, and a water pore volume as measured by conventional water absorption techniques of from 0.1 to 0.75 ml/g by volume.  The B.E.T. method for determining specific surface area is described in detail in Brunauer, S., Emmett, P. Y. and Teller, E., J. Am. Chem. 3oc., 60, 309-16 (1938).<br>
Certain types of a-alumina containing carriers are particularly preferred.  These a-alumina carriers have relatively uniform pore diameters and are more fully characterized by having B.E.T. specific surface areas of from 0.1 to about 3 m2/g, preferably from 0.1 to about 2 m2/g, and water pore volumes, of from 0.10 ml/g to about 0.55 ml/g.  Manufacturers of such carriers include Norton Chemical Process Products Corporation and United Catalysts, Inc. (UCI).<br>
The concentration of undesirable ionizable species present on the surface of the carrier are reduced to create a "cleansed" carrier.  Or, alternatively, the concentration of icnizabie species in the materials used to make the carrier mav be reduced Drier to formation of<br><br>
the carrier.  If the carrier raw materials are treated, the formed carrier may be retreated for further improvement.<br>
lonizable species present on an α-alumina carrier, for example, typically include sodium, potassium, aluminates, soluble silicates, calcium, magnesium, aluminosilicates, and combinations thereof.  It has been found that silicates, and certain other anions, are particularly undesirable ionizable species in an epoxidation catalyst.<br>
After the concentration of the surface ionizable species are lowered, the carrier is optionally dried. When aqueous or organic solvent washing is used, drying or some similar method is recommended to displace the wash solution from the carrier pores.  The carrier is now ready for a catalytically reactive metal to be deposited or impregnated thereon.<br>
The carrier having the controlled solubilization rate is impregnated with metal ions or compound(s), complex (es) and/or salt(s) dissolved in a suitable solvent sufficient to cause the desired deposition on the carrier.  When silver is the deposition material, a typical deposition is from 1 to 40 wt%, preferably from 1 to 30 wt% of silver, basis the weight of the total catalyst.  The impregnated carrier is subsequently separated from the solution and the deposited metal(s) compound is reduced to metallic silver.<br>
One or more promoters may be deposited either prior to, coincidentally with, or subsequent to the deposition of the metal.  Promoters for epoxidation catalysts are typically selected from sulfur, phosphorus, boron, fluorine, Group IA through Group VIII metals, rare earth metals, and combinations thereof.  The promoter material<br><br>
is typically compound(s) and/or sait(s) of the promoter dissolved in a suitable solvent.<br>
For olefin epoxidation oxide catalysts, Group 1A metals afre typically selected from potassium, rubidium, cesium, lithium, sodium, and combinations thereof; with, potassium and/or cesium and/or rubidium being preferred. Even more preferred is a combination of cesium plus at least one additional Group IA metal, such as .cesium plus potassium, cesium plus rubidium, or cesium plus lithium. Group IIA metals are typically selected from magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and combinations thereof, Group VIII transition metals are typically selected from cobalt, iron, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and combinations thereof; and rare earth metals are typically selected from lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, erbium, ytterbium, and mixtures thereof.  Hon-iimiting examples of other promoters include perrhenate, sulfate, molybdate, tungstate, chromate, phosphate, borate, sulfate anion, fluoride anoin, oxyanions of Group IIIB to VIB, oxyanions of an element selected from Groups III through VIIB, alkali(ne! metal salts with anions of halides, and oxyanions selected from Groups IIIA to VIIA and IIIB through VIIB. The amount of Group IA metal promoter is.typically in the range of from 10 ppm to 1500 ppm, expressed as the metal, by weight of the total catalyst, and the Group Vllb metal is less than 3600 ppm, expressed as the metal, by weight of the total catalyst.<br>
For further improvement in catalytic properties, the hydrogen ion activity of the impregnation solution is optionally lowered, such as by the addition of a base. The typical impregnation solution for an epoxidation catalyst begins quite basic, so a strong base is used to further lower the hydrogen ion activity.  Examples of strong bases include, alkyl ammonium hydroxides such as<br><br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and cesium hydroxide.  In order to maintain the desired impregnation solution .formulation and metal loading, a organic base is preferred.  Base additions in these systems typically result in a "measured pH" change    _ ranging up to about 2, realising that the "measured pH" is not a true pH since the impregnation system is not aqueous.<br>
If an excess of impregnation solution is used, the impregnated carrier is subsequently separated from, the solution before the deposited metal compound is reduced. Promoters, components which work effectively to provide an improvement in one or more of the catalytic properties of the catalyst when compared to a catalyst not containing such components, may also be deposited on the carrier either prior to, coincidentally with, or subsequent to the deposition of the catalytically reactive metal.<br>
The-resulting epoxidation catalysts just described are used for the vapor phase production of epoxides, such as in the production of ethylene oxide from ethylene and an oxygen containing gas. In this epoxidation process on or more nitrogen oxides (NOK) may also be added to the feedstock to boost catalyst conversion performance.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention provide catalysts made by the processes just described.<br>

Carrier Water-Washing Procedures for Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8( 10, 11, 13<br>
Carrier washing was carried out by immersing 100 grams of carrier in 300 grams of boiling de-ionized water for 15 minutes.  The carrier was then removed and placed in a fresh 300 grams of boiling water for another 15 minutes.  This procedure was repeated once more for a total of three immersions, at which point the carrier was separated from the water and dried in a well ventilated oven at 150 °C for 18 hours.  The dried carrier was then used for preparation of a catalyst by the procedures outlined in the following Examples. Impregnation Solution<br>
A silver-amine-oxalate stock solution was prepared by the following procedure:<br>
415 g of reagent-grade sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 2340 ml de-ionized water and the temperature was adjusted to 50 °C.<br>
1699 g high purity "Spectropure" silver nitrate were dissolved in 2100 ml de-ionized water and the temperature was adjusted to 50 °C.<br>
This sodium hydroxide solution was added slowly to the silver nitrate solution, with stirring, while maintaining a solution temperature of 50 °C.  The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, then the temperature was lowered to 40 °C.<br>
Water was removed from the precipitate created in the mixing step and the conductivity of the water, which contained sodium and nitrate ions, was measurec.  An amount of fresh deionized water equal to the amount removed was added back to the silver solution. .The solution was stirred for 15 minutes at 40 °C.  The process was repeated until the conductivity of the water removed was less than 90 umho/crc. 1500 mi fresh deionized water was then added.<br>
630 g of high-purity oxalic acid dihydrate were added in approximately 100 g increments.  The temperature was keep at 40 °C and the pK was kept above 7.8.<br>
Water was removed from the mixture to leave a highly concentrated silver-containing slurry.  The silver oxalate slurry was cooled to 30 JC.<br>
699 q of 92 %w ethylenediamine (8% de-ionized water) was added while maintaining a temperature no greater than 30 °C.   The resulting solution contained approximately 27-33 %w silver.<br>
Enough 45 %w aqueous CsOK and water was added to this solution to give a finished catalyst having 14.5 %w silver and a desired cesium loading .{see Examples). Sodium and Silicate Measurement Procedures<br>
The XPS analayses were performed in a VG ESCALAB mkll X-ray photoeiectron spectrometer.  Non-monochromatized Al kα (1484.6 eV) X-rays were used as the excitation source. The electron kinetic energy analyzer was a 150 degree spherical sector analyzer equipped with a three channeltron detection system.  All spectra were obtained in the constant analyzer pass energy mode with the pass energy set at 50 eV.  Prior to analysis, samples were lightly crushed in a mortar and mounted onto a sample —stub using double-sided tape.  The analysis region was roughly 3 mm x 5 mm.  The Al2s peak was used for charge correction and was corrected to 118.5 eV.  Linear baselines were used for measuring the peak heights of the A12s, Si2s, and Nals lines, and a horizontal baseline starting at a bonding energy of 105.5 eV was used for measuring the height of the Si2p line due to an interference with an aluminum Auger line.  Peak intensities were converted to relative molar values using the following empirically derived sensitivity factors: A12s 0.22, Si2p 0.32, Si2s 0.24 and Nals 1.72<br>
and the following relationship:<br>
Relative number or atoms = (peak intensity/sensitivity factor) • 100<br>
(A12s intensity/0.22!<br>
The results of the XPS measurements are given in Table II. The numbers reported for XPS measurements are the number cf atoms detected relative to 100 aluminum atoms.  The XPS silicon values reported are the average of. the Si2p and Si2s values.<br>

pH"Measurement Procedures<br>
Silver solution pH measurements were done using a Metrohm model 744 pH meter, employing a model 6.0220.100 combination electrode and a Pt 100 model 6.1110.100 resistance thermometer for temperature compensation.  The meter was calibrated with commercially available buffer solutions before each use.  In a typical measurement, a 50 ml aliquot of the doped silver solution to be used for a catalyst impregnation was filtered into a 100 ml glass beaker through a 2 micrometer filter attached in-line to a plastic syringe.  The pH probe was lowered into the magnetically stirrea solution, ana the reading obtained<br>
after 3 minutes was recorded as the equilibrated pH.  The probe was cleaned between each measurement with deionized water, and checked for calibration.  Special care was taken to prevent accumulation of AgCl solids on the electrode membrane.  Such accumulation was removed by soaking the probe in ammonium hydroxide solution, as recommended by the manufacturer. Example 1<br>
A catalyst pre-cursor was prepared from Carrier A by first subjecting the carrier to carrier washing. Following the wash, approximately 30 grams of washed Carrier A were placed under a 3.33 kPa vacuum for 1 minute at ambient temperature.  Approximately 50 grams of the impregnating solution was then introduced to submerse the carrier, and the vacuum was maintained at 3.33 kPa for an additional 3 minutes.  The cesium target was 450 ppm/gram finished catalyst.  The vacuum was then released and the excess impregnating solution was removed from the catalyst pre-cursor by centrifugation at 500 rpm for two-minutes.  The catalyst pre-cursor was then dried while being shaken at 240 °C for 4 minutes in a stream of air flowing at 11.3 rnVhr. Example la (Comparative)<br>
Carrier A was impregnated as described in Example 1; however, the carrier was not subjected to carrier washing.  The cesium target was 400 ppm/gram finished catalyst. Example 2<br>

The carrier was then removed and dried in a well ventilated oven at 150 °C for 18 hours.  The carrier was then<br>
impregnated as described in Example 1.  The cesium target was 400 ppm/gram finished catalyst.  In addition, LiOH was dissolved in water and added to the stock impregnation solution to lower the hydrogen ion activity to a "measured pH" of 13.2. Example 13<br>
Carrier A was subjected to carrier washing and impregnation as described in Example 1.  The cesium target was 650 ppm/gram finished catalyst.  In addition, LiOH was dissolved in water and added to the stock impregnation solution to lower the hydrogen ion activity to a "measured pH" of 13.2 and NH4Re04 was dissolved in water and added to the stock impregnation solution to provide 1.5 micromoles Re/gram finished catalyst.<br>
The catalysts of Examples 1-13 were used to produce ethylene oxide from ethylene and oxygen.  3 to 5 grams of crushed catalyst were loaded into a 6.35 mm inside diameter stainless  steel U-shaped tube.  The U tube was immersed in a molten metal bath (heat medium) and the ends were connected to a gas flow system.  The weight of the catalyst used and the inlet gas flow rate were adjusted to achieve a gas hourly space velocity of 6800 ml of gas per ml of catalyst per hour.  The inlet gas pressure was 1450 kPa.<br>
The gas mixture passed through the catalyst bed (in a once-through operation) during the entire test run (including start-up) consisted of 25% ethylene, 7.0% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, 63% nitrogen, and 2.0 to 6.0 ppmv ethyl chloride.<br>
The initial reactor (heat medium) temperature was 180 °C.  The temperature was ramped at a rate of 10 °C per hour from 180 °C to 225 °C, and then adjusted so as to achieve a constant ethylene oxide level of 1.5 %v in the outlet gas stream.  Performance data at this conversion level are usually obtained when the catalyst has been on<br>
stream for a total of at least 1-2 days.  Due to slight differences in feed gas composition, gas flow rates, and the calibration of analytical instruments used to determine the feed and product gas compositions, the measured selectivity and activity of a given catalyst may vary slightly from one test run to the next.<br>
The initial performance values for selectivity at 1.5% ethylene oxide were measured and are reported in Table III.<br>
TABLE III.  Performance Characteristics of Catalysts Prepared From Unwashed and Washed cc-Alumina<br>
(TableRemoved)<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen that significant improvement in catalyst properties are seen when the carrier is washed before the catalytic metal is deposited on the carrier. Even further improvement is seen when the material used to make the carrier is washed before the carrier is formed.<br>
The hydrogen ion activity of the deposition solution for catalysts in Examples 5-13 was lowered by the addition of a base.  It can be seen that lowering the hydrogen ion activity of the deposition solution further improves the catalytic properties.  It is also evident that the phenomenon of the pH effect is not restricted to a particular catalyst formulation, as best illustrated in Examples 7 and 13, where a selectivity enhancing dopant, such as rhenium, is added to the impregnating solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
