The present invention relates to novel isoquinoline derivatives, their preparation and their use in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases related to the inhibition of Rho-kinase and/or of Rho-kinase mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase.<br>
Activation of a small GTPase RhoA upon agonist stimulation results in conversion of RhoA from the inactive GDP-bound form to the active GTP-bound form with a subsequent binding to and activation of Rho-kinase. Two isoforms, Rho-kinase 1 and Rho-kinase 2, are known. Rho-kinase 2 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Activation of Rho-kinase 2 by the active GTP-bound RhoA leads to calcium sensitization of smooth muscle cells through phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of the myosin light chain phosphatase activity and thereby up-regulation of the activity of myosin regulatory light chain (Uehata et al., Nature 1997, 389, 990-994).<br>
It is known that Rho-kinase is involved in vasoconstriction, including the development of myogenic tone (J. Appl. Physiol. 2005, 1940-8, 98), bronchial smooth muscle contraction (Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 20, 1190-1200), hypertension, i.e. pulmonary hypertension (Heart, 91, 391-2. 2005) and ocular hypertension (Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2001. 42, 137-144). endothelial dysfunction (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005. 512, 247-249). artherosclerosis, restenosis (Arch. Mai. Coeur 2005, 98. 249-254), glucose utilization, cardiac hypertrophy (Hypertension 2000, 35, 313-318). erectile dysfunction (Nature Medicine 2001, 7,119-122), retinopathy, inflammation, immune diseases, AIDS, osteoporosis, brain functional disorder, infection of digestive tracts with bacteria (WO 98/06433), cancer development, vascular smooth muscle proliferation and motility (Circ. Res. 1999, 84. 1186-1193; Atherosclerosis 2001, 155. 321-327). endothelial proliferation and motility (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000. 269, 633-640), stress fiber formation (Science 1997, 275. 1308-1311; J. Cell Biol. 2000. 150. 797-806). platelet aggregation (FEBS Lett. 2000, 466, 70-74; Blood 1999. 94. 1665-1672), Na/H exchange transport system activation (EMBO J. 1998, 17. 4712-4722), Alzheimer's disease (Science 2003, 302, 1215-1217). adducin activation (J.<br><br>
Biol. Chem.. 273, 5542-5548,1998). and in SREB (Sterol response binding element) signalling and its effects on lipid metabolism (Circ. Res., 92.1296-304. 2003).<br>
Therefore, a compound having inhibitory effect on Rho-kinase and/or on Rho-kinase mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase is useful for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases involving Rho-kinase as the primary disease cause, e.g. hypertension, i.e. pulmonary hypertension and ocular hypertension, peripheral circulatory disorder, angina pectoris, cerebral vasospasm, asthma, premature birth, hyperaggregability of platelets. Peripheral Occlusive Arterial Disease (PAOD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cancer development, and erectile dysfunction, or as the secondary disease cause, e.g. arteriosclerosis, ischemic organ failure (end organ damage), fibroid lung, fibroid liver, liver failure, fibroid kidney, renal glomerulosclerosis, kidney failure, organ hypertrophy, prostatic hypertrophy, complications of diabetes, blood vessel restenosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure; ischemic diseases; inflammation; autoimmune diseases; AIDS, osteopathy such as osteoporosis, brain functional disorder, infection of digestive tracts with bacteria, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy, glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
WO 01/64238 describes isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide derivatives optionally substituted by a -(CH2)1-6-O-(CH2)0.6-. a -(CH2)0-6-S-(CH2)0-6- or a -(CH2)0-6-linked heterocyclic group useful as neuroprotective agents.<br>
JP 10087629 A describes isoquinoiine derivatives useful for the treatment of infections caused by Heliobacter pylori such as for example gastritis or ulcer. The isoquinoiine derivatives are preferably 5-substituted by X-[(C1-C6)alkylene)]o-1-Y wherein X may<br>
be oxygen and Y may be an aryl or a heterocyclic group.<br>
Hagihara et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999. 7, 2647-2666) disclose 6-benzyloxy-isoquinoline for the treatment of infections caused by Heliobacter pylori. US 5,480.883 generically discloses as EGF and/or PDGF receptor inhibitors useful for inhibiting cell proliferation compounds of the formula "Ar I - X - Ar H" wherein X may<br><br>

Physiologically acceptable salts of compounds of the formula (I) mean both their organic and inorganic salts as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th edition, page 1418 (1985)). Because of the physical and chemical stability and the solubility, preference is given for acidic groups inter alia to sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium salts; preference is given for basic groups inter alia to salts of maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, methylsulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or of carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, for example as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, methanesulfonates, acetates, lactates, maleates, fumarates. malates, gluconates, and salts of amino acids, of natural bases or carboxylic acids. The preparation of physiologically acceptable salts from compounds of the formula (I) and (II) which are capable of salt fomation, including their stereoisomeric fomns, takes place in a manner known per se. The compounds of the fomiula (I) fomi stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts with basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, alcoholates and ammonia or organic bases, for example trimethyl- or triethylamine, ethanoiamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, trometamol or else basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine.

The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or their prodrugs for use as phamrtaceuticals (or medicaments), to the use of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or their prodrugs for the production of pharmaceuticals for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases associated with Rho-kinase and/or Rho-kinase mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase, i.e. for the treatment and/or prevention of hypertension, i.e. pulmonary hypertension and ocular hypertension, peripheral circulatory disorder, angina pectoris, cerebral vasospasm, asthma, premature birth, hyperaggregability of platelets, Peripheral Occlusive Arterial Disease (PAOD). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cancer development, erectile dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, ischemic organ failure (end organ damage), fibroid lung, fibroid liver, liver failure, fibroid kidney, renal glomerulosclerosis, kidney failure, organ hypertrophy, prostatic hypertrophy, complications of diabetes, blood vessel restenosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure; ischemic diseases; inflammation; autoimmune diseases; AIDS, osteopathy such as osteoporosis, brain functional disorder, infection of digestive<br><br>
tracts with bacteria, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy, glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts and/or its prodrugs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i. e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances (or vehicles) and/or additives (or excipients).<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures. Administration, however, can also be carried out rectally, for example in the fomi of suppositories, or parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, microcapsules, implants or rods, or percutaneously or topically, for example in the form of ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in other ways, for example in the form of aerosols or nasal sprays.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se and familiar to one skilled in the art, pharmaceutically acceptable inert inorganic and/or organic carrier substances and/or additives being used in addition to the compound(s) of the formula (I) and/or its (their) physiologically acceptable salts and/or its (their) prodrugs. For the production of pills, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carrier substances for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils. etc. Suitable carrier substances for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about 0.5 to about 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or their<br><br>
physiologically acceptable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount of the active ingredient of the formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts and/or its prodrugs in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from about 0.5 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 to about 500 mg.<br>
In addition to the active ingredients of the formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain one or more additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or their prodrugs. In case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more compounds of the formula (I) the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a specific overall pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. The flexibility permitted with respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of the formula (I) allows a great deal of control over the biological and physico-chemical properties of the compounds and thus allows the selection of such desired compounds. Furthermore, in addition to at least one compound of the formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts and/or its prodrugs, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients.<br>
When using the compounds of the formula (I) the dose can vary within wide limits and. as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compound employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. In general, the daily dose for<br><br>
achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg. in particular from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used as synthesis intemiediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substituents or modification of functional groups.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared according to the following exemplified compounds without limiting the scope of the claims.<br>
In general, protective groups that may still be present in the products obtained in the coupling reaction are then removed by standard procedures. For example, tert-butyl protecting groups, in particular a tert-butoxycarbonyl group which Is a protected form of an amidino group, can be deprotected. i. e. converted into the amidino group, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. As already explained, after the coupling reaction also functional groups can be generated from suitable precursor groups. In addition, a conversion into a physiologically acceptable salt or a prodrug of a compound of the formula (I) can then be carried out by known processes.<br>
In general, a reaction mixture containing a final compound of the formula (I) or an intermediate is worked up and. if desired, the product is then purified by customary processes known to those skilled in the art. For example, a synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such as crystallization, chromatography or I     reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or other methods of separation based, for example, on the size, charge or hydrophobicity of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as amino acid sequence analysis.<br><br>
NMR. IR and mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing a compound of the invention.<br>
