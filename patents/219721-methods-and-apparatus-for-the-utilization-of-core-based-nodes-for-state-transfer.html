TITLE OF INVENTION: METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR THE UnHZ&amp;TBMm CORE BASED NODES FOR STATE TRANSFER<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
5<br>
Communications system frequently include a plurality of network nodes which are coupled to access nodes through which end nodes, e.g., mobile devices, are coupled to the network. Network nodes may be arranged in a hierarchy. Access Authentication and Authorization (AAA) servers are nodes which are normally placed relatively high in the network 10     hierarchy. They normally provide information used for security and access control purposes. Access nodes frequently have a secure link with an AAA server in cases where such servers are used. The secure link may be through one or more node in the hierarchy.<br>
Operators typically manage access sessions in IP networks using the RADIUS<br>
15     protocol and associated RADIUS AAA servers. In the future, AAA systems may be based on new protocols such as DIAMETER. In a system using a RADIUS AAA server, when a user attempts to gain access to an operator network, for the duration of an access session, the local Access Router normally issues one or more RADIUS Access-Requests to an Authentication Server to authenticate that user based on its identity such as a Network Access Identifier (NAT).<br>
20     The AAA database typically has stored the identities of those users allowed to access its system along with the services features they are able to invoke. When the user is successfully authenticated, its access port on the access device is configured with policy state commensurate with the user's service Authorization. The service authorization is normally delivered via RADIUS to the Access Router by the Authorization Server. Whilst authorized, service usage<br>
25     daring an access session is recorded by the Access Router, and sent as accounting records to an Accounting Server using Accounting-Request messages in the RADIUS protocol. The Accounting Server may be part of the AAA server or it may be an independent server using the same protocol with the authorization server. If the user is connected to multiple Access Routers during a single session then the multiple sessions need to be aggregated in the Aceorettrng<br>
30     Servers.<br>
In addition to authorization and accounting issues, communications systems which support mobile devices need to include mechanisms for conveying location information<br><br>
so that a mobile device can change its point of attachment to the network and still have agues, e.g., IP packets, routed to it.<br>
Mobile IP, (versions 4 and 6) also known as NflPv4 [MIPv4] and MIPv6 5     [MPv6], enables a mobile node (MN) to register its temporary location indicated by a care-of-address (CoA) to its Home Agent (HA). The HA then keeps a mapping (also called a binding) between the MN's permanent address, otherwise called Home Address (HoA), and the registered CoA so that packets for that MN can be redirected to its current location using IP encapsulation techniques (tunneling). The CoA used by a MN can be an address that belongs to a Foreign<br>
10    Agent (FA) in an Access Router when MIPv4 is used or it can be a temporarily allocated address to the MN itself, from the Access Router prefix, in which case it is called a collocated care-of-address (CCoA). The latter model also applies to MIPv4 while it is the only mode of operation in MIPv6. Note that for the purpose of this document the terms CCoA and CoA as well as Registration and Binding Update (BU) are interchangeable since they are the corresponding<br>
15     terms for MlPv4 and MIPv6. The methods and apparatus of the invention are applicable to both MIPv4 and MIPv6 unless otherwise mentioned.<br>
AAA systems are typically used with mobile IP to manage IP address allocations (HoAs), to dynamically allocate HAs, to distribute MN profiles to the Access Router and also to<br>
20     distribute security keys to authenticate MDP messages and to secure the air-link. The Mobile Node, an end node which is capable of changing its point of network attachment, typically sends a MJP message to gain access to the system, which triggers a AAA request to authenticate and authorize the Mobile Node. The AAA MN profile and security state is then passed from the AAA system to the Access Router to control services consumed by the MN.<br>
25<br>
MNs may change their point of network attachment, e.g., as they move from one cell to another cell. This involves changing the MNs point of attachment from a first access node, e.g., a first router, to a second access node, e.g., a second router. This processes is commonly known as a handoff. As part of a handoff the MN's CoA/CCoA needs to be spdafced<br>
30     and then transferred into the HA using MIP signaling so that packets are redirected to &amp;e MS via the new Access Router. As part of handoff process, it is necessary to transfer at least same of the first access router's state information corresponding to the MN involved in the handoff to the new access router so that the MN service is not interrupted This process is known as Staie<br>
2<br><br>
Transfer. State transfer may include, e.g., the transfer of AAA profile state information mat was previously delivered via RADIUS to the AR, at which the MN access session commenced. It also may include, e.g., the transfer of air-link security vectors, MN-NAI, MN IP Address, MN-EUI-64, remaining MIP Registration lifetime, MN multicast group membership, admission 5     control state, resource reservation state, diff-serv state, SIP session state, compressor state, MN scheduling history and/or many other potential items of MN specific AR state information.<br>
In at least one known system, the transfer of state information during a handoff is accomplished by the new access node to which a mobile node is connecting sending a state<br>
10    transfer message through the communications network to the old access node to which the mobile node was connected. In response the old access node forwards state information to the new access node. This technique, while effective, has the disadvantage of requiring that a message be sent between the old and new access nodes to initiate the transfer of the state information. The links between access nodes used for the transmission of such messages may<br>
15     become congested or could be used to convey other information and/or signals if the need for messages between access nodes used to initiate the transfer of state information could be eliminated.<br>
In view of the above discussion, it should be appreciated that there is a need for 20     new methods of implementing the communication of state information to a new access node in the case of a mobile node handoff or in other cases where a mobile node enters a new cell. It should also be appreciated that, for the reasons discussed above, avoiding the use of messages between access nodes to trigger the transfer of state information during a handoff is desirable.<br>
25     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a wireless network, mobile end users use end nodes, e.g., wireless devices, to communicate with other network entities, e.g., wireless devices used by other end users, via access nodes. The access nodes may be implemented as wireless access routers, Associated v?Mh 30     each end node there is state, e.g., a set of information comprising various parameters refotfmg to service(s) and/or application^) corresponding to the end node. This state is used by n access route* which serves as the end node's point of network attachment. Each time the aid node changes the point of attachment to the network, the state needs to be re-built or transferred to the<br><br>
access router which serves as the new point of network attachment so that the new access node can continue to provide communication services with regard to existing communications sessions or provide new communications services, e.g., as requested by the end node. This document describes the concept of state transfer between access points/routers as well as a novel 5     way to gather the required state and transfer it from one point to the next.<br>
This application describes methods for transfer of state to support events such as the movement of an end node (EN) between access nodes (ANs). The method uses Core State Management Nodes (CSMNs) located in the core of the network, to store, process and forward 10     state information for the end nodes. The CSMNs used to store and transfer state information in accordance with the invention may be implemented as part of Authentication Authorization &amp; Accounting (AAA) server similar to the type found in many systems.<br>
In accordance with one feature of the invention, access nodes can store state 15     information in a CSMN and can also retrieve, e.g., fetch, state corresponding to an end node from the CSMN used to store that information. Access nodes normally update the stored state for an end node for which they serve as the network point of attachment when the end node signals an intent to end communication with the access node or communication ceases, eg., because communication with the access node is interrupted or terminated prior to completion of 20     a handoff operation.<br>
An access node normally retrieves state information from the CSMN when communication with an end node is initiated, e.g., when the end node enters the cell corresponding to the access node. However, in the case of a handoff, in some embodiments, 25     state information is forwarded from the access node which was previously servicing the end node eliminating the need to retrieve state information from the CSMN.<br>
In accordance with one feature of the invention, during handoff, the mobile node controls the forwarding of state from the first to the second access node being used by fee ssd 30     node. This is accomplished by the end node sending a message to the first access node to forward state information to the second access node. This approach avoids the need for tbe second node to send a message to the first node requesting the transfer of state information<br><br>
thereby reducing the amount of signaling between access nodes as compared to system vmka employ such state transfer messages between access nodes.<br>
In cases where communication is lost with the first access node before the end 5    node can transmit the state transfer signal, the second access node will retrieve the state<br>
information from the CSMN. Use of the transfer message is optional but has the advantage of reducing the number of information retrieval operations which need to be supported by the core node. In addition, the use of the transfer message directed from the end node to the first access node has the advantage of reducing delays in terms of the amount of time between when the end 10    node begins communication with the second access node and when the second access node obtains the state information to be used in servicing the end node. The state transfer message may trigger updating of the state information in the core node in addition to the transfer of state information to the second access node.<br>
15	State information stored by an access node in the CSMN and/or transferred to<br>
another access node will normally reflect any local changes to that state, e.g., changes made at the access node which is storing or transferring the state subsequent to the state information being received either from the CSMN or another access node. Stored state may also be manipulated and modified by the CSMN itself, e.g., as system or session requirements change<br>
20     during an end node access session or other communication operation.<br>
Additional features and benefits of the present invention are discussed in the detailed description which follows.<br>

The network/internetwork interface 420 includes, a receiver circuit 422 and a transmitter circuit 424 used for coupling the node 400 to other network nodes, e.g., via copper 15     wires or fiber optic lines.<br>
The processor 404 under control of various modules, e.g., routines, included in memory 410 controls operation of the CSMN 400 to perform various signaling and processing. The module included in memory 410 is executed on startup or as called by other modules that 20     may be present in memory 410. In the Fig. 4 embodiment, the memory 410 of the CSMN 400 of the present invention includes a Core State Management module 412 and a Core State Management data 413.<br>
The Core State Management Module 412 controls the processing of received 25     signals from other CSMN, access nodes, or network nodes regarding state storage and retrieval. The Core State Management Data 413 includes, e.g., end-node state information. The Core State Management module 412 may access and/or modify the Core State Management data 413.<br>
Figs. 5,6,7 and 8 illustrate the signaling performed in accordance with an<br>
30     exemplary embodiment of the invention. The signaling is illustrated in the context of exemplary system 500, adapted from system 100 illustrated in Fig. 1. Each of the access nodes 14Q, 140^ shown in Figs. 5,6,7 and 8 are simplified representations of the exemplary access node 300 depicted in Fig 3. Additionally, in the exemplary system 500 the end nodes 144,146,144% 146 <br>
T<br>
144", 146" (and corresponding access links 145,147,145', 147', 145", 147") from system 100 have been replaced for purposes of explaining the invention with a single end node, X146, implemented in accordance with the invention. End node, X, 146 shown in Figs. 5,6,7 and 8 is a simplified representation of end node 200 depicted in Fig. 2 and is coupled to the depicted 5     access nodes by one or more wireless communications links.<br>
End node state information transferred between access nodes and core state management nodes in accordance with the present invention is state information relating to, e.g., used to support, communication with the end node which operates as part of the system. In one<br>
10     embodiment of this invention transferred state information will typically include static, long lived and short lived components. Static components may include parameters that do not change over long periods of time and multiple communication sessions. Examples of static state are end node profile information such as general quality of service parameters (e.g.: peak rates allowed) and generic authorization state (e.g.: type of data calls allowed). Examples of long lived state are<br>
15     parameters that do not change during the duration of a communication session (e.g.: a<br>
dynamically assigned Internet address or some long lived security information). Examples of short lived state are parameters that are very dynamic in nature and change multiple times daring a communications session (e.g.: dynamic quality of service state, multicast group membership, etc.)<br>
20<br>
In one embodiment of this invention state information (static, short and long lived) is moved together according to methods described in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment static state resides permanently in CSMNs. In this case both static and dynamic state may be transferred between CSMNs located in different regions, or from CSMN<br>
25     to access nodes. However, while dynamic state information is normally transferred from access nodes to CSMNs, there is no need to communicate static state information to the CSMNs since they already include the information. In an alternative embodiment, all state resides in one or more CSMNs and access nodes and/or CSMNs may update said state as state changes occur.<br>
30     CSMN Operation<br>
CSMN operation in accordance with one feature of the invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 5. Fig. 5 illustrates core state management signaling in a<br><br>
simplified version of the exemplary system depicted in the Fig. 1 and described above. lie depicted signaling may occur as part of a handoff operation. Fig. 5 includes access nodes 140, 140' implemented according to Fig. 3, end node X 146 implemented according to Fig. 2 and a Core State Management Node (CSMN) 104 implemented according to Fig. 4. lines between the 5    nodes of Fig. 5 represent state management related messages sent and received according to the present invention and are explained below. Dashed lines between nodes of Fig. 5 indicate optional messages.<br>
In Fig. 5 End Node X 146 sends, e.g., at the start of a handoff, a Store State 10     Request (SSRQ) message 510 to Access Node 140 comprising the End Node X146 identifier. An end node identifier may be a network address, hardware address, or other identification specific to the user or the device associated with the end node. On reception of the SSRQ message 510 the Access Node 140 searches its State Management data 313 (Fig. 3) for state information associated with said end node and sends a Access Node State Transfer Update (AN-15    STU) message 520 to the Core State Management Node (CSMN) 104. Said AN-STU message 520 comprises the End Node X146 identifier and state associated with said end node as available to Access Node 140.<br>
On reception of the AN-STU message 520 the Core State Management Module 20    412 (Fig. 4) of CSMN Node 104 processes the message and stores the state included in said message in its CSM data 413 (Fig. 4) such that said state is associated with the identifier of the end node also included in said message. CSMN node 104 optionally returns a State transfer Update Acknowledgement (STUAck) message 530 to Access Node 140 indicating the correct reception and storage of said state. Access Node 140 on reception of STUAck message 530 25    optionally sends a Store State Reply (SSRP) message 540 to End Node X 146 indicating the successful storage of said state in the core.<br>
End Node X146 sends a Retrieve State Request (RSRQ) message 550 to Access Node 140' comprising the End Node X146 identifier. On reception of said RSRQ message 550 30     Access Node 140' sends a State Transfer Request (STRQ) message 560 comprising the<br>
identifier of End Node X 146 to CSMN node 104. On reception of said STRQ message 560, the Core State Management module 412 (Fig. 4) of CSMN node 104 processes said message and searches its core state management data 413 for state associated with the End Node X146<br><br>
indicated in said STRQ message. State associated with End Node X 146 that was earlier stored is found and a CSMN State Transfer Update (CSMN-STU) message 570 including said state and the identifier of End Node X146 is sent to Access Node 140'. On reception of CSMN-STU message 570, Access Node 140' stores state included in said message in its state management 5     data 313 (Fig. 3). Access Node 140' optionally sends a Retrieve State Reply (RSRP) message 580 to End Node X146 to indicate the correct retrieval of state associated with said end node from the core.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of this invention the SSRQ message 510 10     additionally includes the identifier of Access Node 140' that End Node X 146 wishes to exchange data with. In that case Access Node 140 sends an additional copy of the AN-STU message 520 to the Access Node 140* as indicated by AN-STU message 521. Access Node 140' receives said message and stores state included in said message and associated with said end node. In this embodiment of the invention when Access Node 140' receives RSRQ message 550 15     it first checks its state management data 313 (Fig. 3) for state associated with said end node and only sends STRQ message 560 if no state is found. In the same embodiment Access Node 140' may optionally send a STUAck message 531 to Access Node 140 on reception of the AN-STU message 521.<br>
20	In the various embodiments described above in regard to Fig. 5, after sate<br>
information is transferred to the second access node 140', network routing information corresponding to end node x 146 is updated so that IP packets and other signals intended for end node X146 will be directed to the second access node 140' instead of the first access node 140. This is accomplished by one of the first and second access nodes 140,140f sending a routing<br>
25     message to one or more network routing devices. In the Fig. 5 example, node 120 is used to represent a routing device, e.g., a router, while messages 590 and 590' represent routing update messages transmitted by the first and second access nodes 140,140' respectively. Normally, only one of the access nodes will be responsible for transmitting the routing update message. In most embodiments this will be the second access node 140* which transmits the message 5901<br>
30     once the state corresponding to end node X146 has been successfully received.<br><br>
Removal of state from CSMN<br>
State may be removed from the CSMN, e.g., upon expiration of a timer. In one embodiment of this invention, on reception of AN-STU message 520, the CSMN 104, in 5     addition to the processing described in the previous two sections, starts a timer of predetermined or negotiated value and associates said timer with the state included in the received message 520 and stored in its core state management data 413 (Fig. 4). When said timer expires, state associated with that timer and corresponding to an end node is removed from the core state management data 413 (Fig. 4) of CSMN node 104. Removal of end node state upon timer<br>
10    expiration does not depend on whether or not this state was requested through a STRQ message while the timer was valid. Furthermore, if while the timer is still valid, the CSMN receives another AN-STU message, from the same or different access node, comprising state for the same End Node X, then the CSMN re-sets the timer to its original value. Resetting the timer is done whether or not the updated state is actually the same or differs from the existing stored state.<br>
15<br>
State Unavailable<br>
In some cases, requested state information may not be available in the CSMN, In one embodiment of this invention, if no state is available for the end node indicated in a received<br>
20     STRQ message 560, the CSMN 104 returns a CSMN-STU message 570 including an indication that no state is available for said end node. In an alternative embodiment of this invention if no state is available for the end node indicated in a received STRQ message 560, the CSMN 104 starts a predetermined or negotiated timer and associates it with said message 560, If state for the end node identified in message 560 is received, say in a AN-STU message 520, prior to the<br>
25     timer expiring, the CSMN processes message 520 as described earlier and immediately stops the timer and sends a CSMN-STU message 570 to Access Node 140'. If the timer expires and no appropriate state is received then the CSMN node 104 returns a CSMN-STU message 570 including an indication that no state is available for said end node. In a third embodiment of this invention if no state is available for the end node indicated in a received STRQ message 560, the<br>
30     CSMN 104 sends an optional Transfer State Request (TSRQ) message 561, comprising the<br>
identifier of End Node X146 and the identifier of Access Node 140* that is currently requesting state, to the last access node that requested state for said end node X146, i.e.: Access Node 140. In this case Access Node 140 sends the AN-STU message 521 to the Access Node 140' as<br>
15<br><br><br><br>
Messages 650,660, 670 and 680 are now generated, processed and exchanged in the same way as described in Fig. 6, the difference being that CSMN node 104' has state 10     associated with End Node X146 in its core state management data 413 (Fig. 4) when it receives STRQ message 660 from Access Node 140\ For that reason the CSMN-STU message 670 is immediately returned.<br>
Hierarchical Core State Management<br>
15<br>
Fig. 8 depicts an alternative embodiment of this invention in which CSMN Nodes are arranged in a hierarchy so that high level CSMN Node 104" maintains copies of all or a part of the state maintained by low level CSMN nodes 104 and 104'. In Fig. 8 messages 510,520, 530,540,550,560,570 and 580 are identical to those described in Fig. 5. The difference is that<br>
20     when the CSMN 104 receives message 520, in addition to the processing described in Fig. 5, the CSMN also sends a State Transition Update (STU') message 522 to CSMN Node 104".<br>
On reception of said STU9 message 522 including said state and the identifier of End Node X 146, CSMN Node 104" stores the state included in said message in its Core State<br>
25     Management data 413 (Fig. 4) and optionally returns a STUAck' message 524 to CSMN Node 104 to indicate correct reception and storage of state. In addition, on reception of STRQ message 560, the core state management module 412 (Fig. 4) of CSMN node 104' processes said message and searches its core state management data 413 for state associated with the End Node X146 indicated in said message. State associated with End Node X146 is not found and thos<br>
30     the CSMN node 104' sends State Transfer Request (STRQ") message 566, including the<br>
identifier of End Node X146 to CSMN node 104". On reception of said STRQ" message 566, the Core State Management module 412 (Fig. 4) of CSMN node 104" processes said message and searches its core state management data 413 for state associated with the End Node X146<br>
19<br><br>
indicated in said message. State associated with End Node X146 that was earlier stored is fotmd and a State Transfer Update (STU") message 568 including said state and the identifier of End Node X146 is sent to CSMN Node 104'. Now message 570 and the rest of the process described in Fig. 5 is completed as before. 5<br>
State transfer in accordance with this invention may take place for a number of reasons. In one embodiment of this invention state transfer is initiated by an end node during a handoff process. The end node attempts to terminate connection with one access node and establish a new connection with another access node due to movement, in which case state<br>
10    transfer as part of a mobility management system, enables the efficient and speedy establishment of connectivity with the new access node with as little interruption as possible to the end node data communication. In one embodiment of this invention the state transfer method described is followed by a routing update message from the new access node or the end node redirecting any data traffic towards the new location of the end node. In one exemplary embodiment of this<br>
15    invention such a routing update would be in the form of Mobile IP registration, while in another embodiment would be a Mobile IPv6 binding update.<br>
In an additional embodiment of this invention state transfer is initiated as part of the transition of an end node from an active state to a dormant state, where data communication 20    is temporarily suspended. In this case state transfer ensures that when end node becomes active again at some future time and possibly at some different access node, connectivity can be initiated quickly and efficiently.<br>
In a yet another embodiment of this invention state transfer is initiated when a 25     link between an end node and an access node is lost, in which case the state transfer mechanism is used for robustness, since the end node may attempt to reconnect via another access node at a future time, again making the reconnection process quick and efficient.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a communications system 800. Fig. 9 illustrates core state 30     management signaling in a simplified version of the exemplary system depicted in the Rg-5. Fig. 5 includes access nodes 140,140' that is the same as, or similar to, the access nodes described in regard to Fig. 3. End node X146 is the same as, or similar to, end node X146 of Fig. 2. In addition, Core State Management Node (CSMN) 104 is the same as, or similar to, the<br>
20<br><br>
CSMN of Rg. 4. lines between the nodes of Fig. 9 represent state management related messages sent and received according to the present invention and are explained below.<br>
In the Fig. 9 embodiment of the invention CSMN Node 104 periodically, or in 5     response to some trigger event, sends Aggregated State Request (ASR) messages 801,803 to access nodes 140,140' respectively. These request messages 801, 803 represent a request for state information. On reception of said messages 801,803, Access Nodes 140,140' aggregate the current state information for end nodes associated with said Access Node and return it to the CSMN Node 104 via messages 802, 804 respectively. On reception of messages 802, 804<br>
10    CSMN 104 de-aggregates the state and stores it in its memory per end node identifier. In this manner the CSMN 104 can control updating of its state information. This update technique can be used in combination with the previously discussed state update techniques. In on embodiment of this invention not all state is returned to the CSMN 104 but only the dynamic state that periodically changes.<br>
15<br>
In one embodiment of the invention Aggregated State Request (ASR) messages 801, 803 are sent one at a time in a round robin way but also periodically where the periodicity is preconfigured. In an alternative embodiment of this invention Aggregated State Request (ASR) messages 801,803 are sent in a round robin way but at times were the loading on the<br>
20     server is below a preconfigured threshold. Alternatively, other techniques for scheduling and/or timing messages 801, 803 maybe used.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention state transfer is implemented overlayed on the AAA system, in which case state transfer messages are novel extensions to already existing<br>
25     AAA messages (e.g.: RADIUS messages) or they are novel AAA messages. In such an<br>
embodiment, the CSMN node may be implemented as a AAA server and belongs to a AAA hierarchy. In an alternative embodiment of this invention the CSMN node is a Mobile Home Agent in which case state transfer messages are implemented as novel extensions to already existing Mobile IP messages or as novel Mobile IP messages. In one embodiment of this present<br>
30     invention, the system is a cellular network. In such an embodiment the access nodes maybe implemented as access routers. Network nodes may be implemented as routers and end nodes may correspond to, e.g., be implemented as, mobile nodes.<br><br>
Kg. 10 iDustrates a communications system 900 which uses a common state information database 910 that can be accessed by multiple server's, e.g., authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) servers 904,904\ State information can be retrieved and stored in the database 910 by individual servers 904,9041 in accordance with the present 5    invention, e.g., as part of a handoff operation. The operation may involve a handoff of an end node 946 from a first access node 940 to a second access node 940In the illustrated system 900 end node X 946 has communications links 510,550 with the first and second access nodes 940,940f, respectively. The system 900 includes one or<br>
10    more additional nodes 120 which perform routing operations. The Fig. 10 system is similar to the system previously described in regard to Fig. 5 and can be implemented using the same or similar elements, e.g., access node and/or server circuitry. Notably the system in Fig. 10 differs from the Fig. 5 system in terms of where state information is stored in the network and the way in which servers access and update the state information. In the Fig. 10 embodiment, a database<br>
15     910 which is external to the AAA servers 904,9041 is used to store state information. This allows multiple AAA servers to share a common state information database 910 avoiding the need to maintain a separate state information database in each AAA server 904,904'. This also avoids the need to pass messages between AAA servers 904,904' as part of a handoff operation as will now be explained in the context of an exemplary handoff operation. Furthermore, it<br>
20     increases the reliability of the system in that the failure of an individual AAA server, e.g.: AAA server 904, does not impact the state transfer process since any AAA server, e.g.: AAA server 904', can retrieve state that was put in the database 910 by any other AAA server e.g.: AAA server 904 connected in the same database 910,<br>
25	AAA protocols use different sets of messages for Authentication/Authorization<br>
(also call AA) e.g.,: Access Requests/Replies and different messages for Accounting (also called A) e.g.: Accounting Requests/Replies. Also the AA part of the AAA server typically just reads the database to retrieve the user profile. That is, the authentication/authorization part normally does not write in the database. The Accounting part of the AAA server, however, typically<br>
30     writes in the database to store the accumulated accounting information for a given end node. Typically the records created by the Accounting server are separate from those created by the AA part of the AAA server. The AA and A parts of the AAA system are logically considered to<br>
22<br><br>
be one thing (Le.: AAA), yet in some case the AA and A parts of the AAA system may be physically separated, e.g., on different servers which comprise part of the database 910.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention depicted in Fig. 5, messages 520', 530', 560* 5     and 5701 are implemented based on new and novel extensions to Authentication/Authorization messages. In Fig. 10 End Node X 946 sends, e.g., at the start of a handoff, a Store State Request (SSRQ) message 510 to Access Node 940 comprising the End Node X146 identifier. In one such implementation of the Fig. 10 embodiment, the end node identifier is the Network Access Identifier (NAI) typically in the format: user_name@realm. On reception of the SSRQ message<br>
10     510 the Access Node 940 searches its State Management data 313 (Fig. 3) for state information associated with said end node and sends an Authentication/Authorization Access_Request message 520', equivalent to the AN-STU message 520 in Fig 5, to the AAA Server 904, Said AccessJRequest message 520' comprises the End Node X 146 identifier (e.g.: NAI) and state associated with said end node as available to Access Node 140'. The state is transported in some<br>
15    cases in new and novel extensions to Access .Request messages. In one embodiment of this invention said extensions are Attribute-Value-Pairs (AVPs), where an Attribute is the type of state (e.g.: protocol ID) and Value is the actual state information. In an alternative embodiment one AVP is used with Attribute an indicating general state and Value including all state associated with said end node 946 now carried as an opaque object.<br>
20<br>
On reception of the Accessjlequest message 520' the AAA Server 904 processes the message and sends a database_write message 905 to the database to store the state included in said message such that said state is associated with the identifier of the end node also included in said message. The database 910 returns a database_write_ack message 906 to the<br>
25     AAA server 904 indicating the success of the write operation. The AAA node 904 also returns a novel version of Access_Accept message 530' to Access Node 940 indicating the correct reception and storage of said state, rather than the typical grant of access to an end node.<br>
End Node X 946 sends a Retrieve State Request (RSRQ) message 550 to Access 30     Node 940' comprising the End Node X146 identifier (e.g.: its NAI). On reception of said RSRQ message 550 Access Node 940' sends a Authentication/Authorization AccessJRequest mess^e 560* (equivalent to STRQ message 560 in Fig 5) comprising the identifier of End Node X146 (e.g.: its NAI) to the AAA Server 904'. Note that message 560' is shown to be sent to an AAA<br>
23<br><br>
server, i.e.: AAA Server 904' that is different from the server to which the earlier message 520' was directed This is shown to illustrate that it is not required all the Access Nodes (e.g.: 940, 940') use the same AAA server (904 or 904') as long as the AAA servers (904 and 904') can access the same database 910. 5<br>
On reception of said Access request message 560', AAA Server 904' processes said message and sends database_read message 907, comprising the end node 946 NAI, to database 910. On reception of message 910 the database searches its memory for state information associated with the End Node X 946 indicated in said database_read message. State 10     associated with End Node X 946 that was earlier stored is found and a the database 910 returns the state in message 908 to the AAA server 904'. On reception of said message 908, AAA server 904' sends Access_Accept message 570' (equivalent to CSMN-STU message 570 in fig 5) to Access Node 940' including said state and the NAI of End Node X 946.<br>
15	On reception of Access_Accept message 570', Access Node 9405 stores state<br>
included in said message in its state management data 313 (Fig. 3) and grants access to end node 946.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention it is possible that on reception of message 20     907 the database 910 has no dynamic state associated with said end node 946. In this case<br>
database 910 may have static state associated with end node 946 in the form of user profile that is not context transferred. In this case the static state for end node 946 is returned to AAA Server 904' via message 908. In this case AAA server 904' may start normal authentication procedures between itself and End Node 946 before it returns Access_Accept. This characteristic of the 25     invention integrates normal end node authentication with context transfer creating a consistent and robust method for accepting end nodes into the system wither for the first time or following a handoff.<br>
The same or similar functionality can be implemented based on the Accounting 30     part of the AAA server by any expert in the art.<br>
