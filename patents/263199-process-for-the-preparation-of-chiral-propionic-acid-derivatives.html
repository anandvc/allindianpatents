				<td>The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the preparation of chiral propionic acid derivatives, especially with the preparation of (S)-2-methoxy-3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl}-propionic acid. (S)-2-methoxy-3 - {4- [2-(5 -methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy] -benzo [b] thiophen-7-yl} -propionic acid and its salts are pharmaceutically active compounds. These compounds are known in the art and are described for example in International Patent Application WO 02/092084. They are especially useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diabetes mellitus type I and II.<br>
The present invention refers to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or salts thereof, comprising catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
or salts thereof, in the presence of a catalyst comprising ruthenium and a chiral diphosphine ligand or comprising rhodium and a chiral diphosphine ligand, to yield said compound of formula (I),<br>

Methods for the preparation of (S)-2-methoxy-3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl}-propionic acid have been described in WO 02/092084. However, these methods include a large number of individual and costly process steps and exhibit a low yield.

It has surprisingly been found that using the process according to the present<br>
invention	(S)-2-methoxy-3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-<br>
benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl}-propionic acid can be prepared much more economically, with less process steps under moderate conditions with an outstanding yield. Further, crude intermediate products can mostly be used in subsequent reaction steps without the need of any additional purification steps.<br>

After cooling to room temperature, 300 ml of isopropyl acetate and 100 ml of water were added under stirring, then the organic phase was separated and transferred into a 500 ml glass flask equipped with a pH meter. After addition of 150 ml of water (pH was 3.0), ca. 58 ml of a 2 N sodium hydroxide aqueous solution were added dropwise at 20Â°C until a pH of 12-12.5 was reached. The organic phase was removed and to the aqueous phase were added at 10-15Â°C dropwise ca. 54 ml of a 2 N aqueous solution of sulfuric acid until a pH of 4-4.5 was reached.

The filtrate was washed with 100 ml of water, then the organic phase was concentrated (ca. 470 ml were distilled off at 50Â°C/150-50 mbar). After addition of 625 ml of DMF, the rest of more volatile solvents are removed completely at 50Â°C/150-50 mbar. The water content at this point was less than 0.4%. This suspension containing the intermediate 4-hydroxy-benzo[b]thiophene-7-carboxaldehyde was transferred with aid of 660 ml of DMF in a 4 1 reactor (equipped as the 21 reactor above) which had been charged with 38.0 g of potassium carbonate. To the dark suspension was added within 60 min at 86-90Â°C a solution of 70.4 g (250 mmol) of 2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl)-4-oxazolyl)ethanol methanesulfonyl ester in 275 ml of DMF.
