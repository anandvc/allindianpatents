This application claims priority from United States provisional application Serial No, 60/204,667 filed May 17,2000, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel  -carboline derivatives, useful as phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The invention further relates to synthesis of the  -carboline derivatives and intermediates used in their preparation. The present invention additionally relates to use of the described derivatives for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to PDE, for example male erectile dysfunction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficiently rigid for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Currently it is estimated that approximately 7-8% of the male population suffers from some degree of ED, the equivalent of at least 20 million men in the United States alone. Since the likelihood of ED increases with age, it is projected that the incidence of this condition will rise in the future as the average age of the population increases.<br>
Male erectile dysfunction may be the consequence of psychogenic and/or organic factors. Although ED is multi-factorial, certain sub-groups within the male population are more likely to present with the symptoms of the disorder. In particular, patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis have a particularly high prevalence of ED, In addition, patients who take certain<br><br>
classes of drugs such as antihypertensives, antidepressants, sedatives, and anxioiytics are more prone to suffer from ED,<br>
Treatments for ED include a variety of pharmacologic agents, vacuum devices, and penile prostheses, Among the pharmacologic agents, papaverine, phentolamine, and alprostadil are currently used in practice. These agents are only effective after direct intracavernosal or intraurethral injection, and are associated with side effects such as priapism, fibrosis, penile pain and hematoma at the injection site. Vacuum devices are a noninasive alternative treatment for ED. These devices produce an erection by creating a negative pressure around the shaft of the penis resulting in an increased blood flow into the corpus cavemosum via passive arterial dilation. Although this form of therapy is frequently successful in ED of organic origin, complaints include the lack of spontaneity and the time involved in using a mechanical device, and difficulty and discomfort with ejaculation. A variety of semi-rigid or inflatable penile prastheses have been used with some success, particularly in diabetic men. These devices are generally considered when other treatment options have failed, and am associated with an increased risk of infection and ischemia.<br>
Recently, the phosphodiesterase V (PDEV) inhibitor, sildenafit (Viagra®) was approved by the FDA as an orally effective medication for the treatment of ED. Sildenafil, 5-[2-ethoxy-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylsulphonyi)phenyr]-1-methy1-3-n-propyl-6-7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one and a number of related analogs and their use as antianginal agents are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,250,534 and 5,346,901. The use of sildenafil and related analogs for treating mate erectile dysfunction is described in PCT International Application Publication No. WO 94/28902, published December 22,1994. In clinical studies, the drug improved sexuaf function in about 70% of the men who suffer from ED of psychogenic or organic etiology, However, the drug showed less dramatic efficacy in patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy, with improved erections in 43% of patients who took sildenafil versus 15% on placebo. In addition, the use of sildenafil is associated with several undesirable side effects including headache, flushing and<br><br>
disrupted color vision which result from non-selective effects on a variety of tissues. In spite of these shortcomings, the drug is viewed by patients as preferable to other treatments which involve the introduction of medication directly into the penis via injection, the use of an external device or a surgical procedure.<br>

Ueki et. al., in US Patent No 5,126,448 describe pyridine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine derivatives useful as psychotropic drugs haying antianxiety effects. Atkinson et. al., in US Patent No. 3,328,412 describe 1-aryl- and 1-<br><br>
heteroaryl-2-acly-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- -carboline derivatives having long lasting analgesic properties.<br>
Sexually stimulated penile erection results from a complex interplay of physiological processes involving the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, and the smooth muscle. Specifically, release of nitric oxide from the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves and endothelium activates guanylyl cyclase and increases intracellular cGMP levels within the corpus cavernosum. The increase in intracellular cGMP reduces intracellular calcium levels, resulting in trabecular smooth muscle relaxation, which, in turn, results in corporal volume expansion and compression of the sub-tunical venules leading to penile erection.<br>
PDEV has been found in human platelets and vascular smooth muscle, suggesting a role for this enzyme in the regulation of intracellular concentrations of cGMP in cardiovascular tissue. In fact, inhibitors of PDEV have been shown to produce endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation by potentiating the increases in intracellular cGMP induced by nitric oxide. Moreover, PDEV inhibitors selectively lower the pulmonary arterial pressure in animal models of congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Hence in addition to their utility in ED, PDEV inhibitors would likely be of therapeutic benefit in conditions like heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and angina.<br>
Agents that increase the concentration of cGMP in penile tissue, either through enhanced release or reduced breakdown of cGMP, are expected to be effective treatments for ED. The intracellular levels of cGMP are regulated by the enzymes involved in its formation and degradation, namely the guanylate cyclases and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). To date, at least nine families of mammalian PDEs have been described, five of which are capable of hydrolyzing the active, cGMP, to the inactive, GMP, under physiological conditions (PDEs I, II, V, VI, and IX). PDE V is the predominant isoform in human corpus cavernosum. Inhibitors of PDEV, therefore, would be expected to increase the concentration of<br><br>
cGMP in the corpus cavemosum and enhance the duration and frequency of penile erection.<br>
Additionally, selective PDE inhibitors are known to be useful in the treatment of various disorders and conditions including male erectile dysfunction (ED), female sexual arousal dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction related to blood flow and nitric oxide production in the tissues of the vagina and clitoris, premature tabor, dysmenorrhea, cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, arterial occlusive disorders, thrombosis, coronary rest stenosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic heart disorders, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, intermittent claudication and diabetic complications.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to identify compounds which increase the concentration of cGMP in penile tissue through the inhibition of phosphodiesterases, specifically PDEV. It Is another object of the invention to identify compounds which are useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction and/or impotence in male animals and sexual dysfunction in female animals. Still another object of the invention is to identify methods for treating sexual dysfunction, especially erectile dysfunction, using the compounds of the present invention.<br>
It is another object of the invention to identify compounds which are useful for the treatment of conditions of disorders mediated by PDEV, such as male erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, arterial occlusive disorders, thrombosis, coronary rest stenosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic heart disorders, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, intermittent claudication or diabetic complications.<br>
We now describe a series of  -carboline derivatives with the ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase type V in enzyme assays and increase the concentration of cGMP in cavemosal tissue in vitro.<br><br>

Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a<br>
29<br><br>
pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as com starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicaicium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>

IN VITRO TESTING<br>
Cyclic Nucieoide Phosphodiesterase (PDE| Assay PDEV Isolation<br>
PDEV was isolated from rabbit and hyman tissues according to the protocol described by Boolell et al. (Booleil, M., Allen, M J., Batlarvt, S. A, G@[o-Attm, S,, Muirfiead, Q, J.t Naylor, A. M., Ostertoh, I. H., and! Qingefl, C) in International Journal of Impotence Research 1996 8,47-52 with minor modifications.<br>
Briefly, rabbit or human tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer solution containing 20mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.25M sucrose, 1mM EDTA, and 1mM phenyfrnethylsulprionyf fluoride (PMSF). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 minutes at 4"C. The supernatant was filtered through 0.2nM filter and loaded on a Pharmacia Mono Q anion exchange column (1ml bed volume) that was equilibrated with 20mM HEPES, 1mM EDTA and O.SmM PMSF. After washing out unbound proteins, the enzymes were eiuted with a linear gradient of 100-600 mM NaCI In the same buffer (35 to 50 ml total, depending on the tissue. Enzymes from the skeletal muscle, corpus oavemosum, retina, heart and platelet were eiuted with 35,40,45, 50, and 50 ml respectively,) The column was run at a flow rate of 1 mt/min and 1ml fractions were collected. The fractions comprising various PDE activities were pooled separately and used in later studies.<br>

Measurement of Inhibition of PDEV<br>
-   The PDE assay was carried out as described by Thompson and Appleman in Biochemistry 1971 10, 311-316 with minor modifications, as noted beiow.<br>
The assays were adapted to a 96-well format. The enzyme was assayed in 5mM MgCl2, 15mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 \iM cGMP or cAMP, 0.1 nCi [3H]-cGMP or [3H]-cAMP, and 2-10 \ii of column elution. The total volume of the assay was 100 $d. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 minute and then cooled down on ice. The resulting [3H] 5'-mononucleotides were further converted to uncharged [3H]-nucleosides by adding 25 pJ 1 mg/ml snake venom (Ophiophagus hannah) and incubating at 30*C for 10 minute. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml Bio-Rad AG1-X2 resin slurry (1:3). All the charged nucleotides were bound by the resin and only the uncharged [3H]-nucleosides remained in the supernatant after centrifuging. An aliquot of 200 jil was taken and counted by liquid scintillation. POE activity was expressed as pmol cyclic nucleotide hydrolyzed/min/ml of enzyme preparation.<br>
Inhibitor studies were carried out in assay buffer with a final concentration of 10% DMSO. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of product increased with time and enzyme concentration in a linear fashion.<br>
Example 11 In Vitro Determination of K] for Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors:<br>
The assay was adapted to a 96-well format. Phosphodiesterase was assayed in 5mM MgCI2, 15mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 nM 3H-cGMP and test compound at various concentrations. The amount of enzyme used for each reaction was such that (ess than 15% of the initial substrate was converted during the assay period.   For all measurements, the test compound<br>
58<br><br>
was dissolved and diluted in 100% DM3G (2%DMSO in assay). The total volume of the assay was 100 jil. The reaction mixture was incubated at 3Q*C for 90 minutes. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 minute and then immediately cooled by transfer to an ice bath. To each wefi was then added 25 pi 1 mg/mf snake venom (Ophiophagus hannati) and the reaction mixture incubating at 30*C for 10 minute. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml Bio-Rad AG1-X2 resin slurry (1:3), An aliquot of 200 jJ was taken and counted by liquid scintillation,<br>
The % inhibition of the maximum substrate conversion (by the enzyme in the absence of inhibitor) was calculated for each test compound concentration. Using GraphFad Prism's nonlinear regression analysis {sigmoidal dose response), the % inhibition vs log of the test compound concentration was plotted to determine the-ICso. Under conditions where substrate concentration " Km of the enzyme (Km = substrate concentration at which half of the maximal velocity of the enzyme is achieved), Kt is equivalent to the IC50 value.<br>
Mass spec and PDEV inhibitory activity for representative compounds of the present invention are described in Tables 6-7. Inhibitory data is presented either as the ICgo (fiM), as a percent inhibition at a given concentration of test compound or as a Ki value.<br>
