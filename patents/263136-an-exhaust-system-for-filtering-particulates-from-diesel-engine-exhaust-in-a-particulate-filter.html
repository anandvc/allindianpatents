CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This   application   claims   the   benefit  of  U.S.   Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/786,062, filed on March 24, 2006.   The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0002] Certain of the subject matter of the present application was<br>
developed under Contract Number DE-FC-04-03AL67635 awarded by the<br>
Department of Energy. The U.S. government has certain rights in this<br>
invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0003] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
heating particulate filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0005] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
diesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust gas by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in<br>
the exhaust stream. Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel particulates<br>
are burned within the PF.<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0006] Conventional regeneration methods inject fuel into the<br>
exhaust stream after the main combustion event. The post-combustion<br>
injected fuel is combusted over one or more catalysts placed in the exhaust<br>
stream. The heat released during the fuel combustion on the catalysts<br>
increases the exhaust temperature, which burns the trapped soot particles in<br>
the PF. This approach, however, can result in higher temperature excursions<br>
than desired, which can be detrimental to exhaust system components<br>
including the PF.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, an exhaust system that processes exhaust<br>
generated by an engine is provided. The system includes: a particulate filter<br>
(PF) that is disposed downstream of the engine and that filters particulates<br>
from the exhaust; and a grid that includes electrically resistive material that is<br>
segmented by non-conductive material into a plurality of zones and wherein<br>
the grid is applied to an exterior upstream surface of the PF.<br>
[0008]	In  other features,  an exhaust system that  processes<br>
exhaust generated by an engine to regenerate a particulate filter is provided.<br>
The system includes: a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed downstream of<br>
the engine and that filters particulates from the exhaust; a grid that: includes<br>
electrically resistive material that is segmented by non-conductive material<br>
into a plurality of zones and wherein the grid is applied to an exterior<br>
upstream surface of the PF; a plurality of switches disposed between a power<br>
source and the plurality of zones; and a control module that selectively<br>
activates and deactivates the plurality of switches to supply electrical energy<br>
to selectively heat the plurality of zones wherein the heat initiates<br>
regeneration of particulates in the PF.<br>

description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference<br>
numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1 an exemplary diesel engine<br>
system 10 is schematically illustrated in accordance with the present<br>
invention. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration<br>
system described herein can be implemented in various engine systems<br>
implementing a particulate filter. Such engine systems may include, but are<br>
not limited to, gasoline direct injection engine systems and homogeneous<br>
charge compression ignition engine systems. For ease of the discussion, the<br>
disclosure will be discussed in the context of a diesel engine system.<br>
[0019] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine<br>
12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters<br>
the system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter<br>
14 and is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the<br>
fresh air entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air<br>
generally, the greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then<br>
passes through an air cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0020] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders<br>
26. Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the<br>
systems and methods of the present invention can be implemented in engines<br>
having a plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10<br>
and 12 cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the<br>
present invention can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel<br>
is injected into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the<br>
compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture<br>
creates exhaust. Exhaust exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0021] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a<br>
diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally,<br>
an EGR valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the<br>
intake manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the<br>
turbocharger 18 to drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of<br>
the  fresh  air  received  from  the  air filter  14.     Exhaust flows  from  the<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
turbocharger 18 through the DOC 32 and the PF 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes<br>
the exhaust based on the post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of<br>
oxidation increases the temperature of the exhaust. The PF 34 receives<br>
exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any soot particulates present in the<br>
exhaust.<br>
[0022] A control module 44 controls the engine and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed information. More specifically, the control module<br>
44 estimates loading of the PF 34. When the estimated loading achieves a<br>
threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter) and the exhaust flow<br>
rate is within a desired range, current is controlled to the PF 34 via a power<br>
source 46 to initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the<br>
regeneration process varies based upon the amount of particulate matter<br>
within the PF 34. It is anticipated, that the regeneration process can last<br>
between 4-6 minutes. Current is only applied, however, during an initial<br>
portion of the regeneration process. More specifically, the electric energy<br>
heats the face of the PF for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2 minutes). Exhaust<br>
passing through the front face is heated. The remainder of the regeneration<br>
process is achieved using the heat generated by combustion of particulate<br>
matter present near the heated face of the PF 34 or by the heated exhaust<br>
passing through the PF.<br>
[0023] With particular reference to Figures 2 and 3, the PF 34 is<br>
preferably a monolith particulate trap and includes alternating closed<br>
cells/channels 50 and opened cells/channels 52. The cells/channels 50,52<br>
are typically square cross-sections, running axiaily through the part. Walls 58<br>
of the PF 34 are preferably comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of<br>
cordierite material. It is appreciated that any ceramic comb material is<br>
considered within the scope of the present invention. Adjacent channels are<br>
alternatively plugged at each end as shown at 56. This forces the diesel<br>
aerosol through the porous substrate walls which act as a mechanical filter.<br>
Particulate matter is deposited within the closed channels 50 and exhaust<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
exits through the opened channels 52. Soot particles 59 flow into the PF 34<br>
and are trapped therein.<br>
[0024] For regeneration purposes, a grid 64 including an electrically<br>
resistive material is attached to the front exterior surface referred to as the<br>
front face of the PF 34. Current is supplied to the resistive material to<br>
generate thermal energy. It is appreciated that thick film heating technology<br>
may be used to attach the grid 64 to the PF 34. For example, a heating<br>
material such as Silver or Nichrome may be coated then etched or applied<br>
with a mask to the front face of the PF 34. In various other embodiments, the<br>
grid is composed of electrically resistive material such as stainless steel and<br>
attached to the PF using a ceramic adhesive. It is also appreciated that the<br>
resistive material may be applied in various single or multi-path patterns.<br>
Exhaust passing through the PF 34 carries thermal energy generated at the<br>
front face of the PF 34 a short distance down the channels 50,52. The<br>
increased thermal energy ignites particulate matter present near the inlet of<br>
the PF 34. The heat generated from the combustion of the particulates is<br>
then directed through the PF to induce combustion of the remaining<br>
particulates within the PF.<br>
[0025] With particular reference to Figure 3, a thermally conductive<br>
coating 72 can be additionally applied at the inlets 62 of the channels 50,52.<br>
The coating 72 can extend a short distance down the opened ends of the<br>
closed channels 50. In various embodiments, the conductive coating extends<br>
within an inch of the front face of the PF. The resistive material of the grid 64<br>
contacts the conductive coating 72. Thermal energy is transferred to the<br>
conductive coating 72 when electrical energy passes through the resistive<br>
material. Heat from the conductive coating 72 ignites particulate matter<br>
present near the inlet of the PF 34.<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
[0026] With reference to Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C, to reduce the<br>
electrical impact on the system during regeneration, the grid 64 can be<br>
segmented into a plurality of zones. Each zone can be heated separately by<br>
supplying power to a pathway of resistive material located within each zone.<br>
The zones are separated by non-conductive material. It is appreciated that<br>
the front face of the PF may be heated by zones segmented in a variety of<br>
forms as illustrated by Figures 4A-4C.<br>
[0027] For example, as shown in Figure 4A a PF could be zoned<br>
into equally divided segments for the ease of vehicle integration. Zones such<br>
as those illustrated in 4B, which form concentric circles could be used to<br>
mimic flow patterns. Also, the PF my be segmented according to zones<br>
shown in Figure 4C where the resistive material can be dispersed more<br>
uniformly in order to more evenly heat the face of the PF 34. This strategy<br>
minimizes the heating area but utilizes the fact that soot combustion broadens<br>
to adjacent channels as it travels down the length of the PF 34. Therefore,<br>
maximizing the total particulate matter consumed while minimizing the heated<br>
area and electrical power. Within each zone, it is also appreciated that the<br>
resistive pathways may be formed according to various single path and multi-<br>
path patterns.<br>
[0028] For purposes of clarity, the remainder of the disclosure will<br>
be discussed in the context of Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4A, the grid 64<br>
is divided into three zones 74-76. Resistive pathways 77-79 are formed to the<br>
grid 64 in a spiral pattern within the zones 74-76. The zones are separated by<br>
non-conductive material 80,81. As shown in Figure 5, electrical terminals 86-<br>
90 are individually located at each of the three zones 74-46. Electrical energy<br>
is supplied via insulated wires 82-84 to each of the electrical terminals 86-90.<br>
It is appreciated that each of the zones may be heated sequentially, all at<br>
once, or on an as needed basis.<br><br>
GP-308426-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
[0029] With reference to Figures 4A, 5, and 6, electrical energy is<br>
supplied to each of the electrical terminals 86-90. The control module 44<br>
controls the heating of each zone 74-46 individually. A plurality of switches<br>
90-94 can be activated and deactivated to allow current to flow to each zone<br>
74-46. For example, voltage is supplied via the power source 46 to the<br>
plurality of switches 90-94. A switch driver control unit 96 is controlled by the<br>
control module 44 to activate and deactivate each of the switches 90-94. An<br>
additional switch 98 may be added to allow a sensor 100 to sense the voltage<br>
and/or current supplied by the power source 46. This can be done for<br>
diagnostic purposes. Based on the diagnosis, the control module 44 controls<br>
the activation and deactivation of the switches 90-94.<br>
[0030] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>
of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will<br>
