PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to suspension system of vehicles and more particularly this invention is related to improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension and method of mounting thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Generally to increase the strength and the stiffness of the rear suspension twist beam structure, it is conventional to incorporate a tubular element called stabiliser bar in the structure. This hollow tubular bar is welded at the ends of the trailing arm.<br>
Cold drawn Electric resistance Welded (CEW)/ Electric Resistance Welded (ERW) tubes are subjected to an operation to increase the thickness locally and to increase the strength thereof; a metallic cover is either press fitted or welded at the ends to prevent foreign particle entry in that region and subsequently corrosion is prevented.<br>
When the section of the tubular bar is to be increased considerably for achieving higher roll stiffness of the suspension, the stresses at the joint location of the stabilizer bar increases considerably. So in order to reduce the stress at the joinery of stabilizer bar, alternate solutions are required.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTIONS<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide the improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension.<br><br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the method of mounting of improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension, which increases the strength of the rear suspension structure.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension, which reduces the stress at the joinery of the stabiliser bar in the twist beam structure.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is provide improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension, which provides the sealing means to prevent the entry of foreign particles.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension comprises;<br>
Hollow tubular member connected to the twist beam structure,<br>
Trailing arm structure at both the ends connects the said hollow tubular<br>
member by joinery means.<br>
Pin member having circular cross-section configured to be disposed at both<br>
ends of the said hollow tubular member.<br>
Improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension in accordance with this invention, wherein said pin member is press fitted at both ends of the said hollow tubular member.<br>
Improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension in accordance with this invention, wherein said joinery means is used to join said<br><br><br>
trailing arm structure and said hollow tubular member is conventional joinery means.<br>
Method of mounting improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension comprises;<br>
Selecting hollow tubular member for connecting to the twist beam structure, Disposing the pin member at both ends of the said hollow tubular member, Joining the said hollow tubular member to the said trailing arm structure<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the novel embodiment of the present invention, improved stabiliser bar of twist beam structure for rear suspension of vehicles comprises hollow tubular member (1) having suitable diameter connected to the twist beam structure, trailing arm structure (2) having hollow structure, pin member (3) having circular cross section configured to be fitted in to the said hollow tubular member (1) to minimize the stresses in the joinery means formed between the said trailing arm structure (2) and said hollow tubular member. Said pin member (3) is press fitted to both ends of the hollow tubular member (1) for providing a structure similar to the homogeneous structure.<br>
This arrangement, apart from reducing the stresses in the joinery means formed between the said trailing arms structure (2) and said hollow tubular member, pin member acts as a sealing means for preventing entry of foreign particles unlike other structures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Figure - 1 shows the pin member fitted to the ends of the hollow tubular member.<br><br><br>
Figureâ€”2 shows an isometric view of the twist beam welded structure. Figure - 3 shows the complete assembly twist beam welded structure of rear suspension.<br>
