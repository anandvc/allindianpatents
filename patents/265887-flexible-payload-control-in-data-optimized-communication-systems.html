				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An access terminal (AT) and a data-optimized cellular communication radio network (RN) negotiate a set of packet sizes for use on a reverse link between the AT and the RN. The negotiated set of packet sizes may differ from the default set of packet sizes defined in an existing standard, such as lxEV-DO Revisions A and B. The packet sizes in the negotiated set may be tailored to provide a good fit with an application transmitting data on the reverse link, such as a voice encoder of a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application. The AT and the RN communicate using the negotiated set of packet sizes. The packet sizes of the negotiated set may be mapped to the same reverse rate indicator (RRI) channel codewords as are defined in systems operating under the standard. Packing efficiency is thus increased, and higher capacity for delay-sensitive applications is achieved.</td>

Serial Number 60/775,443, entitled "Wireless Communication System, and Method," filed on February 21, 2006; the present Application for Patent also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 60/775,693, entitled "DO Communication System and Method," filed on February 21, 2006. Each of these Provisional Patent Applications is assigned to trie assignee of the present Application and is expressly incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including all figures, tables, and claims.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
| 	Tlie  present invention relates  generally to  telecommunications,   and,  more<br>
specifically, the invention relates to cellular communication systems.<br>
Background<br>
(€003f	A   modern   communication   system   is   expected   to   provide   reliable   data<br>
transmission for a variety of applications, such as voice and data applications. In a point-to-multipoint communications context, known communication systems are based on frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and perhaps other multiple access communication schemes.<br>
(00041	A CDMA system may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards,<br>
such as Ci) the TJA/EFA-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" (this standard with its enhanced revisions A and B may be referred to as the "IS-95 standard"), (2) the "T1A/EIA-9S-C Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station" (the "IS-98 standard*), (3) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP) and embodied in a set<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
3 <br>
of documents known as the W-CDMA standard/' (4) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2) and embodied in a set of documents including wTR.-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," the "C.S0005-A Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," and the "TIA/EIA/3S-856 cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification" (the vtcdma200O standard" collectively), (5) the IxEV-DO standard, and (6) certain other standards. The standards expressly listed above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including annexes, appendices, and other attachments.<br>
[G00S1	Data-optimized or "DO" cellular communication systems have been developed<br>
to satisfy the constantly increasing demand for wireless data services. As the name implies, DO systems ate optimized for data transmission (as opposed to voice transmission), and in particular such systems are optimized for downlink, data transmission. Data-optimized systems need, not exclude uplink data transmission, or voice transmission in either direction. It should be noted that voice may also be transmitted as data, for example, in the case of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) transmissions.<br>
{0006]	In cellular DO CDMA systems, reverse link data may be transmitted over the air<br>
interface using any one of a number of predefined packet sizes, for example, 128, 256, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, 8192, 12288 bit sizes. Generally, the sizes correspond to different rates, although the use of incremental redundancy with Hybrid Automatic Repeat-reQuest (HARQ) may affect the actual rates achieved in the field.<br>
100071	Some applications provide packets that do not fall neatly into one of the<br>
predefined sizes. For example, a vocoder (voice encoder) of a VoIP telephony application may provide periodic packets of 300 bits. According to one approach, such situations may be handled by choosing a smallest predefined packet size that is still Larger than the packet size provided by the application. For a 300-bit application packet sixe. a 512-bit packet size may thus be selected on the reverse link of the air interface. The larger size packet is then used to transmit at least a portion of two or more packets provided by the vocoder (or another application). This approach leads to additional delay, because of the necessity lo wait lo assemble multiple vocoder packets into a<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
single air interface packet The additional dcfay may be excessive for tbe quality of<br>
service (QoS) of the application. To avoid the additional delay, another approach fits<br>
one user application packet into the larger size'air interface packet, and. stuffs the<br>
leftover bits in the larger size packet. This approach wastes the stuffed bits and thus<br>
causes a loss of spectral efficiency, increased interference, and decreased battery life.<br>
[00GS1	Therefore, there is a need in the art for methods and apparatus that would<br>
improve packing efficiency and spectral efficiency on the reverse link. There is also a need in the art for methods and apparatus that would improve reverse link efficiencies for delay-sensitive applications. There is a further need in the art for methods and apparatus that would improve reverse link efficiencies for delay-sensitive applications while at the same time maintaining backward compatibility with legacy access terminals, and minimizing or eliminating hardware changes to the radio network.<br>

PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
wireless telephone, and personal digital assistant (PDA) with wireless communication capability. An access terminal transmits and receives data packets to or from a radio network controller through one or more base transceiver stations.<br>
[00241	Base transceiver stations and base station controllers are parts of a network<br>
called radio network, RN, access network, and AN. A radio network may be a UTRAN or UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network. The radio network may transport data packets between multiple access terminals. The radio network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio network, such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, a conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN), or another radio network, and may transport data, and voice packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. Depending on conventions and on the specific implementations, a base transceiver station may be referred to by other names, including Node-B, base station system (BSS), and simply base station. Similarly, a base station controller may be referred, to by other names, including radio network controller, KNC, controller, mobile switching center, or serving GPRS support node.<br>
(0025|	The scope of the invention extends to these and similar wireless communication<br>
system components.<br>
[0026]	FIG. 1 illustrates selected components of a communication network 200, which<br>
includes a radio network controller 110 coupled to wireless base transceiver stations I20A, 120B, and 120C. The base transceiver stations 120 communicate with access terminals I30A, 130B, 13QC, and 130D through corresponding wireless connections 140A through HOE. Each of the wireless connections 140 represents both a forward link (from the BTS to the AT, also known as downlink) and a reverse [ink (from the AT to the BTS, also known as uplink). The radio network controller 110 is coupled to a public switched telephone network 150 through a telephone switch 160, and to a packet switched network 170 through a packet data server node (PJDSN) 180. Data interchange between various network elements, such as the radio network controller 110 and the packet data server node 180, may be implemented using any number of protocols, for example, the Internet Protocol (IP), an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol, Tl, El, frame relay, and other protocols.<br>
[0027)	The radio network controller 110 and the base transceiver stations 120 are part<br>
of a data-optimized cellular CDMA radio network 101 „ for example, a IxEV-DO radio<br><br>

PCTYUS2007/062455<br><br>
network, hi the illustrated embodiment, the radio network 101 provides bom data communication services and cellular telephone services to the access terminals 130. In alternative embodiments;, the radio network may provide only data services (including VoIP and similar packetized data-based voice communications).<br>
[0028]	Multiple or even all of the access terminals 330 may be in the same cell or site,<br>
or each access terminal 130 may be in a separate ceil or site.<br>
(0029|	A typical access terminal, for example, the access terminal 130A, includes<br>
receiver circuitry 1.31, transmitter circuitry 132, encoder 133, decoder 134, equalizer 135, processor 136, and memory device 137. The receiver, transmitter, encoder, decoder, and equalizer are configured by the processor executing program code stored in the memory device. Each access terminal 130 is configured to communicate data using at least, one transmission protocol, such as the wireless packet transmission protocols described in the standards mentioned above, including 1xE V-DG revisions A and B, with at least one of the access terminals 130 being further configured to negotiate a set of reverse link packet sizes in accordance with the variants described in this document. The access terminals 130 communicate with the base transceiver stations 120 via wireless connections 140A through 140E, as shown in FIG. L<br>
10030]	Each of the base transceiver stations 120 includes one or more wireless receivers<br>
(eg., receiver 121 of the BTS 120A), one or more wireless transmitters (e.g.;. transmitter 122 of the BTS 120A), radio network controller interface (eg interface 123), a memory (e.g., memory 124), a processor (e.g., processor 125), and encoder/decoder circuitry (egi, encoder/decoder circuitry 126). A receiver/transmitter pair and other components of each base transceiver station are configured by the station's processor operating under control of the program code stored in the BTS's memory, to establish forward and reverse links with the access terminals 130 in order to send packets to and receive packets from the access terminals 130. In the case of data services, for example, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the packet switched network 170 through the packet data server node ISO and through the radio network controller 110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130. The base transceiver stations 120 may receive reverse link data packets that originate at the access terminals 130, and forward these packets to the packet switched network 170 through, the radio network controller 1.10 and the packet data server node 180.   in the<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
11<br>
case of telephone (voice) services, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the telephone network .150 through the telephone switch 160 and through the radio network controller 110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130. Voice packets originating at the access terminals 130 may be received at the base transceiver stations 120 and forwarded to the telephone network 150 via the radio network controller 110 and the telephone switch 160.<br>
J00311	In   some   alternative   embodiments,   the   transmitter,   receiver,   and   other<br>
components of each BTS may each have separate processors.<br>
[0032]	The radio network  controller  110  includes  an  interface   111   to the base<br>
transceiver stations 120, an interface 112 to the packet data server node 180, and an interface 113 to the telephone switch 160. The interfaces 111, 112, and 113 operate under control of one or more processors 114 executing program code stored in one or more memory devices 1 IS,<br>
[00331	^ie network 100 illustrated in FIG. I includes one public switched telephone<br>
network, one packet switched network, one base station controller," three base transceiver stations, and four access terminals. A person skilled in the art would recognize, after perusal of this document, that alternative embodiments in accordance with aspects of the invention need not. be limited to any particular number of these components. For example, a lesser or a greater number of base transceiver stations, radio network controllers, and access terminals may be included in some embodiments. Furthermore, the communication network 100 may connect the access terminals 130 to one or more additional communication networks, for example, a second wireless communication network having a number of wireless access terminals.<br>
(0034]	In an embodiment, one or more of the access terminals 130 (e.g:, the terminal<br>
130A) communicate with a base transceiver station 120 of the radio network {e.g., the BTS 120A). The radio network and one or more of the access terminals are configured to define and negotiate a set of air interface packet sizes at the time of connection setup. At die same time, none, one, or several of the access terminals may operate in accordance with an existing (default, not negotiated) set of air interface packet sizes in accordance with one of the aforementioned standards. In some variants, the set of negotiated packet sizes has the same number of size entries as the number of default packet size entries under one of the applicable air interface standards mentioned above.<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
For example, tiie number of packet sizes may be twelve or thirteen. In this way, each of<br>
the air interface packet sizes may be mapped to the existing codewords associated with<br>
packet sizes on the reverse rate indicator (RRI) channel of an existing air interface<br>
standard.<br>
[0035J	It should be noted that in some variants fewer or more codewords than, in the<br>
standard may also be defined and negotiated in some variants. For example, three unused (in the standard) RR1 codewords may be mapped to additional packet size entries in the negotiated set. Moreover, the mapping of the entries in the negotiated set need not be such that the same size is mapped onto the same codeword under an existing air interface standard and the negotiated set of size entries. Given an existing standard's sizes as listed above (32S, 256, 512, 7685 1024, 1536", 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, 8192, 1.2288), a new size of 300 bits may be used instead of SI2, for example. The negotiated set may then be as follows: I2St 256, 300, 768,1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, S192, 12288. Given the sequence of RRI codewords in order of increasing packet sizes in the default (standard) set, the same sequence may be mapped in order to the increasing packet sizes in the negotiated set set. The new 300-bit size is then mapped to the RRI codeword used for the 512-bit size in the default set. This exemplary mapping is shown, in Table 1 below, where RRI; represents an RRI codeword used to indicate a packet size, the corresponding packet size of the RRI; codeword in the existing standard appears in the middle row (under RRXi), and the corresponding packet size of the RRIL in the negotiated set appears in the bottom row (also in the same column as RRIj). Thus, the middle row represents the default set, and the bottom row represents the negotiated set. Same convention applies to the other tables showing codeword mappings.<br><br>

[0036]	In the example shown in Table 1, some granularity was lost near the newly-<br>
added 300-bit size, because the 512-bit default size has been replaced by the 300-bit size in the negotiated set. The packet size selection choice now jumps from 300 bits to 768 bits, a ratio of more than two and one-half.<br>
10037}	In accordance with, another approach, the negotiated set may be as follows: 128,<br>
256, 300, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 2048,, 3072, 4096, 6144, 8192. Here, the 300-bit size was added between the 256- and 512-bit default sizes, displacing the 12288-bit default size. This approach may be advantageous because an application requesting a 300-bit air interface packet size is more likely not to need a 12288-bit size man a 512-bit size, or any of the other packet sizes. The RRI codewords used for the 128- and 256-bit sizes may be the same, respectively, as the RKi codewords for the default 128- and 256-bit sizes in existing standards/systems, and the RRU. codewords used for the default 512, 768, 1024, J536, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, 8192, 12288 bit sizes may be mapped, in order, to RRI codewords used for the 300, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, 8192 bit packet sizes of the negotiated set. This exemplary mapping is shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
TABLE 2<br>
[0038)	In some variants the negotiated set substitutes a newly-defined packet size for<br>
the size most distant from the newly-defined packet size. Most distant in this context may be, for example, measured linearly (largest difference in the number of bits between the newly-defined size and the removed packet size), or logarithmicaliy/geometricaily (largest ratio in dBs between the two sizes).<br>
{0039J	In some variants, the RRI codewords used for the packet sixes of the negotiated<br>
set are mapped to the codewords corresponding to the same sizes within the default set of the existing standard, to the extent possible.   When replacing the 12288-bit size with<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
14<br>
a 300-bit size, for example, the RRI codeword correspondence may be as in Table 3 below;<br><br>
TABLE 3<br>
£00401	The advantage of this approach is that RRI mapping changes for only the<br>
number of the new packet sizes defined in the negotiated set of RL packet sizes. The example of table 3 also illustrates removal of the packet size most distant to the newly-added packet size.<br>
{0041]	The set of packet sizes negotiated by the base transceiver station 120 and the<br>
TABLE 4<br>
access terminal 130 may substitute multiple or even ali of the packet sizes in the default set of an existing standard. Thus, multiple closely-spaced, non-standard packet sizes may be present in the negotiated set For example, an interval between adjacent packet sizes in the default set may be broken up into sub-intervals by two or more newly-defined packet sizes of the negotiated set. The interval may be broken up into equal or substantially equal (equal to the extent possible) sub-intervals. Table 4 below provides an example of such variant, where an interval between 76S bits and 1.024 bits is broken into three substantially equal sub-intervals of 85 bits, 86 bits, and 85 bits.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT7US2007/062455<br><br>
(0042]	The interval between non-adjacent packet sizes of an existing standard system<br>
may also be similarly broken into sub-intervals. The subintervais may be equal or substantially equal, or spaced in a geometric proportion. Table 5 below illustrates a variant with equal sub-intervals between 3072 and 6144 packet sizes.<br><br>
TABLE 5<br>
iOQ43|	The variants described above are exemplary. The negotiated set may have other<br>
packet size values. Indeed, all of the packet sizes may be negotiated and become different from the default packet size values used under an existing standard. Generally, the easting RRI codewords may be assigned to the packet sizes in the negotiated set in any manner whatsoever, and the invention does not exclude using a fewer or a greater number of RRI codewords than the number of RR1 codewords in the existing standard system. Some access terminals may communicate with the radio network after negotiating a set of packet sizes, while other access terminals may concurrently use the default packet size set of the existing standard. In mis way, one or more legacy access terminals may be served at ihe same time as one or more access terminals configured to negotiate die set of allowable reverse link packet sizes.<br>
[0044]	Turbo codes (e.g.., R-l/5) may be used in the radio network.  The packet sizes<br>
that are not exact powers of 2 may use a turbo interleaver parameter based on the next larger packet size that is a power of 2. A channel interleaver for smallest default payload larger than the payload to be transmitted may be employed, with a look-up table used to determine the exact packet sizes. If total transmit power to pilot power ratio (T2P) values are defined for the default packet sizes of the existing standard system, the T2P for the new (negotiated) payload packet sizes may be generated by linearly interpolating T2P values of the default payload packet sizes.<br><br>

PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
[0045]	FIG.   2  illustrates  an   exemplary  process  200  performed in  the course  of<br>
negotiating a set of packet sizes for the reverse link between the access terminal and the radio network. The steps may be performed by an access terminal (e.g.^ the AT 130A) and a base transceiver station (e.g., the BTS 120A).<br>
[0046]	At flow point 201, the access terminal is ready to begin the process.<br>
|0047J	At step 210, one or more desired values for packet sizes of the reverse link are<br>
determined. In a variant, the access terminal receives the packet size value(s) from one or more user applications executing on the access terminal. For example, a vocoder of a VoIP telephony application may provide one or more packet sizes. The application(s) may have the vahie(s) stored, or determine the packet size value(s) dynamically, in response to current need, current configuration, and/or current QoS.<br>
[0048|	At step 220, the access terminal determines a complete set of packet sizes to<br>
request from the radio network. For example, the access terminal may replace one or more default values of the existing standard with one or more values received from the application^) as illustrated m the Tables and accompanying explanations above.<br>
[0049|	At step 230, the access terminal transmits to the radio network (eg, to the BTS)<br>
a request to use the desired set on the reverse link. This may be done by using a previously unassigned codeword on one of the reverse link control channels.<br>
[00SOJ	At step 240, the radio network receives from the access terminal the desired set<br>
of packet size values.<br>
[0051|	At step 250, the radio network uses predefined criteria to generate its own. set of<br>
packet size values, based on the set of the desired values received from the access terminal. For example, the radio network may accept the values received from the access terminal. As another example, the radio network may substitute one or more different non-default or default values for the non-defaltalues desired by the access terminal, based on some parameters), such as quality of service assigned to the application or the access terminal. In some variants, the radio network may also determine that the default set should be used notwithstanding the access terminal's preference. In some variants, the radio network also maps the RRl codewords to the packet sizes, or changes the mapping of the RRl codewords to the packet sizes from that requested by the access terminal (if the access terminal Requested a specific mapping in the step 230).<br><br>
WO 2007/098458<br><br>
PCT/US2007/062455<br><br>
{0052]	At step 260, the radio network transmits to the access terminal the set of packet<br>
sue values to be used on the reverse link. If the RRX mapping order has not been predefined, it may also be communicated to the access terminal. A downlink: control channel may be used for this purpose.<br>
[0053]	At step 270, the radio network configures itself for receiving reverse link data<br>
from the access terminal using the set of packet size values/mappings to be used (Instead of the default set). The set transmitted from the radio network thus becomes the negotiated set. Note that if the radio network accepted the values received from the access terminal, the negotiated set is identical to the desired set.<br>
[0054]	At step 280, the access terminal receives from the radio network the set of<br>
packet size values/mappings to be used.<br>
{0055]	At step 290, the access terminal configures itself for transmitting reverse link<br>
data, using the negotiated set of packet size values/mappings (instead of the default set).<br>
[0056]	At step 295, the access terminal transmits reverse link data to the radio network<br>
using the negotiated set of packet size values/mappings. The transmitted packets may have one or more sizes that are not included in the default set of packet sizes. The process then terminates at flow point 299.<br>
[0OS7]	As illustrated in FIG. 2, the set of packet size values is negotiated with a single<br>
request from the access terminal and a single response from the access network, in some variants, however, multiple requests and responses may be used when the access network does not immediately accept the set desired by the access terminal. For example, the steps 220-260 may be repeated two or more times to arrive at a negotiated set of reverse link packet sizes, with the determination m the step 220 in second and later iterations being atTected by the response of the radio network to the previously transmitted desired set.<br>
[00531	RRI codeword mappings may also be negotiated in  some variants, or the<br>
mappings may be predefined, for example, using a predetermined RRT codeword sequence in an ascending or descending packet size order.<br>
