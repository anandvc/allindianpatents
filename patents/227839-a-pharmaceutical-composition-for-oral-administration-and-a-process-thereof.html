				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration and a process thereof.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention being a new pharmaceutical composition is related to a novel pharmaceutical preparation for oral administration and the use of this pharmaceutical preparation in the therapy of hypertension and of diseases in the cardiovascular system and secondary effects thereof in mammals including man. It is also related to compositions and to methods of preparing said pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparation is a fixed unit dosage form of the long-acting angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, in instant release form and a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine type i.e. a calcium channel blocking agent (dihydropyridine compound) in an extended release formulation.<br>
The present invention also relates to solid preparations which are fixed combinations of the long acting ACE inhibitor ramipril in instant release form and a dihydropyridine compound such as the vascular selective drug felodipine in extended release form having the characteristic of achieving an effect over 24 hours after once daily administration. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention retain a good therapeutic effect in the treatment of hypertension even when the active drugs are administered in low doses. The pharmaceutical preparations reduce the dose related adverse events which result from administering higher doses of each of the drugs separately. The pharmaceutical preparations of this invention simplify me regimen and improve patient compliance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
ACE inhibitors are compounds which inhibit the conversion of angiotensine I into<br><br>
the active angiotensine II as well as the breakdown of the active vasodilator bradykinin. Both of these mechanisms lead to vasodilation. Such compounds have been described in, for example, EP 158927, EP 317878. US 4,743,450, and US 4,857,520. Ramipril (disclosed in EP 079022) is a long-acting ACE inhibitor. Its active metabolite is the free acid ramiprilat, which is obtained in vivo upon administration of ramipril. In hypertensive patients administration of ramipril is known to cause a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance and thus a reduction of the blood pressure without a compensatory rise in heart rate. It is being used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Furthermore, ramipril has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with clinical signs of congestive heart failure after surviving an acute myocardial infarction. Ramipril has been suggested to have an added advantage over many other ACE inhibitors due to its pronounced inhibition of ACE in tissues resulting in organ protective effects in e.g. the heart, lung, and kidney.<br>
Ramipril substance is sensitive to high temperature, moisture or compression and therefore, upon formulation into pharmaceutical preparations needs special attention in order to retain its stability (US 5,151,433).<br>
Calcium antagonists are compounds which influence the inflow of calcium ions into cells, in particular into the cells of smooth muscles. Such compounds of the dihydropyridine type have been described in, for example, GB 1358951 (nitrendipine), US 3,644,627 (nifedipine), EP 007293 (felodipine), and GB 2164336 (lacidipine).<br>
The most common adverse events which are observed in clinical use of the ACE inhibitor and the calcium antagonists of this invention are headache, coughing, peripheral oedema, flush, dizziness, fatigue and nausea.<br>
Some dihydropyridines, for example nifedipine and felodipine are decomposed<br><br>
when exposed to light, and therefore, upon handling and formulation into pharmaceutical preparations need special attention in order to retain their stability.<br>
Combinations of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists of dihydropyridine type in the treatment of hypertension have been described in, for example EP 488059, EP 180785 and EP 265685.<br>
Bainbridge, A.D. et al. (Br.J. Clin. Pharmac. 1993, 36: 323-330) have studied the use of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril and an extended release formulation of the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist felodipine given in free combination as separate dosage forms.<br>
In US 4,703,038 solid combinations for oral administration of certain ACE inhibitors and certain dihydropyridine compounds including i.a. nitrendipine and felodipine are described. This document also describes a method of treating hypertension in man using such combinations. US 4,703,038 does not, however, disclose ramipril as an ACE inhibitor. Neither does it describe the use of extended release formulations of dihydropyridines.<br>
In US 5,236,933 the use of combinations of certain ACE inhibitors including i.a. ramipril, and certain calcium antagonists, i.a. felodipine have been described in the prevention and/or treatment of proteinuria.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The term "instant release" as used herein defines the release of an active drug component that conforms with the criteria in USP XXII under entry "  Dissolution" when Q = 75%, the time interval is 60 minutes and the dissolution medium is the one specified in the Examples 5-8 below.<br><br>
The term "extended release" as used herein defines the dissolution of the active drug component from the dosage form over an extended period of time, i.e. for more than 6 hours as measured with the testing method described in Examples 5-8 below.<br>
The term "fixed unit dosage form" as used herein defines a physical embodiment containing more than one active drug component, which embodiment has a heterogenous structure.<br>
Dose figures of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the active drug given herein relate to the amount of the corresponding free base or acid.<br>
The present invention provides a solid, fixed unit dosage form for oral administration, for example a tablet or a capsule, of an instant release formulation of the long acting ACE inhibitor ramipril or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of ramipril, and an extended release preparation of a dihydropyridine selected from the group consisting of felodipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine, and lacidipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Said solid, fixed unit dosage form is effective and tolerable after once daily dosing. Most preferred of the dihydropyridines is felodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The choice of an instant release formulation of the long acting ACE inhibitor ramipril and an extended release preparation of a dihydropyridine both contribute to the optimal use of both drugs thereby minimizing the adverse effects while still being effective against elevated blood pressure.<br>
The molecule corresponding to ramipril has five chiral centers and can, thus, occur in 32 different enantiomeric forms. The enantiomer with the name (2S,3aS,6aS))-l-[N-[(S)-l-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-octahydro-cyclopenta[b]pyrrol-2-carboxylic acid is preferred. This compound is called ramipril.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of ramipril are. for example, salts with pharmaceutical^ acceptable amines or inorganic or organic acids such as, for example. HC1, HBr, H2SO4, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid and citric acid.<br>
Felodipine has one chiral center and can, thus, occur in two different enantiomeric forms. The vasodilatory effect of the S form is stronger than the vasodilatory effect of the R form. However, both the S form and racemic mixtures of the S form and the R form can be used.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of felodipine can be prepared from inorganic and organic acids including for example acetic, benzene-sulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, fumaric. gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethonic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, and p-toluene-sulfonic acids.<br>
An extended release formulation can, for example, be constructed to give a hydrophilic gel matrix wherein the active substance is enclosed and which upon contact with aqueous solutions will swell to permit release of the active substance by diffusion and/or attrition.<br>
In order to prevent decomposition of ramipril substance by the action of moisture during storage or compression during the manufacturing process the substance is, according to the present invention preferably powder-coated when included in a compressed part of the dosage form. The dihydropyridine substance is light sensitive and is, therefore, protected by a coating layer.<br>
The dose range of ramipril in the combined fixed unit dosage forms is 1-10 mg. The dose range in the combined fixed unit dosage forms is, for felodipine<br><br>
1-10 mg, for nitrendipine 2-40 mg, for nifedipine 5-70 mg and for lacidipine 1-8 mg.<br>
Most preferred dose range in the combined fixed unit dosage forms is, for ramipril 1-5 mg, for felodipine 1-5 mg, for nitrendipine 5-20 mg, for nifedipine 10-60 mg and for lacidipine 2-6 mg.<br>
A preferred form of the present invention consists of a solid fixed unit dosage form for oral administration which is a low dose combination of an instant release formulation of 1-5 mg of the long acting ACE inhibitor ramipril or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an extended release formulation of 1-5 mg of the vascular selective calcium antagonist felodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Especially preferred dose intervals for this preferred form of the invention are 1-3 mg of ramipril and 1-3 mg of felodipine. The preferred dosis quotient between ramipril and felodipine in the preferred form of the present invention is 1:1.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are for once daily administration utilizing the different blood pressure lowering mechanisms of the ACE inhibitor ramipril in an instant release formulation and a dihydropyridine compound selected from the group consisting of felodipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine, and lacidipine in an extended release formulation. The bioavailability of the ramipril component of the pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention as measured by the blood plasma concentration of ramiprilat is equivalent to that of the same component administered separately, see Example 1. Also the bioavailability of the dihydropyridine component of the pharmaceutical preparation is equivalent as measured in the same way, see Example 2. The compositions of tablets which were tested are shown in Example 12.<br>
The use of a low dose of the two active components and the extended release of<br><br>
the dihydropyridine component of the pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention administered once daily give a lowering effect on blood pressure but no compensatory increase in heart rate. It is effective in the treatment of systolic as well as diastolic hypertension. The pharmaceutical preparation is particularly effective in the treatment of systolic hypertension. So administered the preparations have a beneficial influence upon conditions of and associated with high blood pressure (hypertension) in mammals including man. Examples 3 and 4 illustrate the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention in comparative tests between either ramipril or felodipine and solid fixed combination dosage forms of ramipril and felodipine. It can be seen that there is a surprisingly high degree of reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the combined low dose (2.5 mg + 2.5 mg of ramipril and felodipine) preparation in the example in comparison both with each of the components in monotherapy and with the fixed combined preparation of the components in higher (5 mg + 5 mg) dose.The incidence of the most common adverse events during administration of an ACE inhibitor (dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea and coughing) are low and comparable with that of placebo. The adverse events of administration of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (increased heart rate, flushing, peripheral oedema, headache and dizziness) are also low and comparable to placebo.<br>
Above all it is evident from Examples 3 and 4 that the most bothersome adverse event of administration of ACE inhibitors, namely coughing, and of administration of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, namely peripheral oedema and flushing is less common with the low dose combination compared with the monotherapies (F5 and R5).<br>
The release of the respective components in in vitro tests can be seen in Examples 5 to 8.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is formulated as a combined solid fixed unit<br><br>
dosage form for oral administration which in combination with the once daily administration facilitates the regimen and improves patient compliance.<br>
The combined solid fixed unit dosage forms of the present invention can be for example capsules or tablets, which optionally can be coated.<br>
As examples of formulations of ramipril which can be enclosed into capsules can be mentioned ramipril in the form of powder or granules, optionally attached to a carrier substance, and tablets. Examples of extended release preparations of dihydropyridine which can be enclosed into such capsules are granules or tablets. A capsule wherein the ramipril substance is attached to a carrier substance and the dihydropyridine is enclosed in a tablet core consisting of a hydrophilic gel matrix and the process for manufacturing the same is illustrated in Example 9.<br>
Examples of the construction of tablets as fixed unit dosage forms of ramipril and an extended release dihydropyridine portion are shown in Figure 1, 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a tablet where the dihydropyridine ER (D) matrix preparation is enclosed in a surrounding layer containing instant release ramipril (R) substance. Such a tablet can be manufactured in a suitable tabletting machine. Alternatively, the matrix containing dihydropyridine can be compressed to tablets in a tabletting machine and then coated with a coating containing ramipril. One tablet of this type is illustrated in Example 10.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a tablet where the ramipril (R) component is placed at the upper part of the matrix containing the dihydropyridine ER (D) preparation. The instant release ramipril component is contained in a smaller part which is enclosed in a larger, separate part containing the felodipine extended release preparation. Instant release of ramipril is achieved since it is not entirely enclosed in the matrix. Such a tablet can be manufactured in a suitable tabletting machine.<br><br>

felodipine ER-ramipril 5+5 mg (FR 5+5), felodipine ER-ramipril 2.5 + 2.5 mg (FR 2.5+2.5), felodipine ER 5 mg (F5), ramipril 5 mg (R5). or placebo.<br>
Eleven-hundred and three (1103) patients were enrolled and nine-hundred and thirty-nine (939) patients from six countries (Australia, Canada. Denmark, Italy, New Zealand and Sweden) were randomised into this study. Eight-hundred and seventy (870) patients completed the study. In the analyses 518 males and 421 females with a mean age of 57 years, ranging from 24 to 86 years, were included.<br>
Supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured 4 hours and 24 hours post dose at randomisation (baseline) and after 11 and 12 weeks of treatment.<br>

The treatments with combined fixed unit dosage forms also gave a significantly greater reduction in both supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the individual monotherapies.<br>
Furthermore, the low dose combination is equally (compared to felodipine) or more (compared to ramipril) effective in reducing supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure than double the dose of the individual monotherapies.<br>
Similar results were obtained in the standing position indicating no orthostatic effects with any of the treatments.<br><br>

Both therapies with combined fixed unit dosage forms were very well tolerated. The number of patients with adverse events and number of patients with adverse events causing stop of therapy in the fixed combination groups were comparable to that of placebo.<br>
The incidence of the most common adverse event observed during administration of an ACE inhibitor (dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea and coughing) and during administration of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (increased heart rate, flushing, peripheral oedema, headache and dizziness) tended to be lower during therapy with combined fixed unit dosage forms than during therapy with the individual monotherapies. Above all, this is evident for the most bothersome adverse events with ACE inhibitors coughing, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, peripheral oedema and flush.<br>
