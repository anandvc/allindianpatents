				<td>IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENGINE CONTROLLER UNIT'S<br>
NON-VOLATILE MEMORY FOR MEASURING THE TIME OF A FUEL<br>
CELL SYSTEM IN A SHUT-OFF OR STANDBY STATE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to a method for determining<br>
the time a fuel cell system has been shut-down and, more particularly, to a<br>
method for determining how long a fuel cell system in a vehicle has been shut-<br>
down that includes combining a stand-by timer that provides a time count when<br>
the vehicle ignition is still on, but the fuel cell system is off, and a shut-off timer<br>
that provides a time count when the vehicle ignition is off.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can<br>
be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an<br>
electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte<br>
therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives<br>
oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free<br>
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode.<br>
The protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate<br>
water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and<br>
thus are directed through a load to perform work before being sent to the<br>
cathode.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a<br>
popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer-<br>
electrolyte proton-conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid<br>
membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic<br>
particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an<br>
ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane.<br>
The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and<br>
the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
 <br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack<br>
to generate the desired power. For the automotive fuel cell stack mentioned<br>
above, the stack may include two hundred or more fuel cells. The fuel cell stack<br>
receives a cathode reactant gas, typically a flow of air forced through the stack<br>
by a compressor. Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of<br>
the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-<br>
product. The fuel cell stack also receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that<br>
flows into the anode side of the stack.<br>
[0005]	The fuel cell stack includes a series of bipolar plates<br>
positioned between the several MEAs in the stack, where the bipolar plates and<br>
the MEAs are positioned between two end plates. The bipolar plates include an<br>
anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the stack. Anode gas<br>
flow channels are provided on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the<br>
anode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. Cathode gas flow channels<br>
are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode<br>
reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. One end plate includes anode gas<br>
flow channels, and the other end plate includes cathode gas flow channels. The<br>
bipolar plates and end plates are made of a conductive material, such as<br>
stainless steel or a conductive composite. The end plates conduct the electricity<br>
generated by the fuel cells out of the stack. The bipolar plates also include flow<br>
channels through which a cooling fluid flows.<br>
[0006]	It has been proposed in the art to provide stack order<br>
switching or anode flow-shifting in a fuel cell system that employs split stacks.<br>
Particularly, valves and plumbing in the system are provided so that the anode<br>
exhaust gas exiting a first sub-stack is sent to the anode side of a second sub-<br>
stack, and the anode exhaust gas exiting the second sub-stack is sent to the<br>
anode side of the first sub-stack in a cyclical manner.<br>
[0007]	When a fuel cell system is shut down, un-reacted hydrogen<br>
gas remains in the anode side of the fuel cell stack. This hydrogen gas is able to<br>
diffuse through or cross over the membrane and react with the oxygen in the<br>
cathode side. As the hydrogen gas diffuses to the cathode side, the total<br>
pressure on the anode side of the stack is reduced below ambient pressure.<br>
 <br>
This pressure differential draws air from ambient into the anode side of the stack.<br>
When the air enters the anode side of the stack it generates a hydrogen/air front<br>
that creates a short circuit in the anode side, resulting in a lateral flow of<br>
hydrogen ions from the hydrogen flooded portion of the anode side to the air-<br>
flooded portion of the anode side. This high ion current combined with the high<br>
lateral ionic resistance of the membrane produces a significant lateral potential<br>
drop (~0.5 V) across the membrane. This produces a local high potential<br>
between the cathode side opposite the air-filled portion of the anode side and<br>
adjacent to the electrolyte that drives rapid carbon corrosion, and causes the<br>
carbon layer to get thinner. This decreases the support for the catalyst particles,<br>
which decreases the performance of the fuel cell.<br>
[0008]	At the next system start-up, assuming enough time has gone<br>
by, both the cathode and anode flow channels are generally filled with air. When<br>
hydrogen is introduced into the anode flow channels at system start-up, the<br>
hydrogen pushes out the air in the anode flow channels also creating a<br>
hydrogen/air front that travels through the anode flow channels. The<br>
hydrogen/air front causes a catalytic reaction along the length of the membrane<br>
in each fuel cell as the front moves that, in combination with the reaction across<br>
the membrane, creates a high electric voltage potential. This combined electric<br>
voltage potential is high enough to severely degrade the catalyst and the carbon<br>
particles on which the catalyst is formed, reducing the life of the MEAs in the fuel<br>
cell stack. Particularly, the reaction created by the hydrogen/air front in<br>
combination with the normal fuel cell reaction is orders of magnitude greater than<br>
only the fuel cell reaction across the membrane. For example, it has been shown<br>
that without addressing the degradation effects of the hydrogen-air front at<br>
system start-up, it only takes about 100 shut-down and start-up cycles to destroy<br>
the fuel cell stack in this manner.<br>
[0009]	It has been proposed in the art to reduce the degradation<br>
effect of the hydrogen/air front at system start-up by forcing hydrogen through the<br>
anode flow channels as quickly as possible so as to reduce the time that the<br>
degradation occurs. It has also been suggested to introduce hydrogen into the<br>
anode flow channels at a slow rate to provide active mixing of the air and<br>
 <br>
hydrogen to eliminate the hydrogen/air front. It has also been proposed in the art<br>
to cool the fuel cell before removing the hydrogen from the anode flow channels.<br>
However, all of these solutions have not reduced the hydrogen/air degradation<br>
enough to provide a desired lifetime of the fuel cell stack. Particularly, moving<br>
the hydrogen/air front quickly does not completely eliminate the degradation of<br>
the catalyst, and requires over-sized piping and other components to rapidly<br>
purge the air from the anode flow channels. Introducing the hydrogen slowly at<br>
start-up has the disadvantage of requiring a recirculation pump that takes several<br>
minutes to completely remove the air from the anode flow channels. Further,<br>
requiring precise control of the amount of hydrogen into the anode flow channels<br>
is difficult to implement.<br>
[0010]	it has also been proposed in the art to provide a load across<br>
the fuel cell stack, such as a resistor, to reduce the electric potential generated<br>
by the hydrogen/air front. However, an extremely low resistance load will require<br>
electrical components with a high power rating. Also, flow balancing between<br>
cells in a fuel cell stack can result in corrosion to the cell anodes. Furthermore,<br>
in most embodiments, a resistor is typically not sufficient on Its own to minimize<br>
carbon corrosion.<br>
[0011]	Based on the discussion above, it is apparent that it is<br>
desirable to know the gas constituents in the anode and cathode side of a fuel<br>
cell stack at system start-up for a more efficient and safe start-up sequence.<br>
Simulations can be run to show what the gas constituents are in the fuel celt<br>
stack based on the time since the last system shut-down. Therefore, it is<br>
desirable to know how long a fuel cell stack has been shut-down.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]	In accordance with the teachings of the present invention,<br>
a method is disclosed for providing an accurate time that a fuel cell system has<br>
been shut-down so that the gas constituents in the anode and cathode side of<br>
the fuel cell stack can be known for an efficient next system start-up sequence.<br>
The method uses two timers, a stand-by timer that provides a time count for how<br>
long the fuel cell system has been off, but the vehicle ignition is still on, and a<br>
 <br>
shut-off timer that provides a time count of how long the vehicle ignition has been<br>
off. The two time counts are added to give a complete time count of how long<br>
the fuel cell stack has been shut-down.<br>

apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017] The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention<br>
directed to a method for determining how long a fuel cell system has been shut-<br>
down is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the<br>
invention or its applications or uses.<br>
[0018] Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a fuel cell system 10<br>
including a first split fuel cell stack 12 and a second split fuel cell stack 14. A<br>
compressor 16 provides cathode input air on cathode input line 18 to the split<br>
stacks 12 and 14 through a normally closed cathode input valve 20. Cathode<br>
exhaust gas is output from the split stack on line 24 and cathode exhaust gas is<br>
output from the split stack 14 on line 26 where the cathode exhaust gas is<br>
combined into a single cathode output line 28. A normally closed cathode back<br>
pressure valve 30 controls the flow of the cathode exhaust gas through the line<br>
28. A cathode by-pass line 32 between the input line 18 and the output line 28<br>
allows the cathode input air to by-pass the stacks 12 and 14. A normally closed<br>
by-pass valve 34 controls whether the cathode air by-passes the stacks 12 and<br>
 <br>
14. If the valves 20 and 30 are closed and the valve 34 is open, then air from the<br>
compressor 16 will by-pass the stacks 12 and 14. Typically, a cathode<br>
humidification unit (not shown) will be provided at a suitable location in the<br>
cathode input line 18.<br>
[0019] In this non-limiting embodiment, the split stacks 12 and 14<br>
employ anode flow-shifting where the anode reactant gas flows back and forth<br>
through the split stacks 12 and 14 at a predetermined cycle in a manner that is<br>
well understood to those skilled in the art. An injector 38 injects hydrogen gas<br>
from a hydrogen gas source 40 through anode line 42 to the split stack 12 and an<br>
injector 44 injects hydrogen gas from a hydrogen source 46 through anode line<br>
48 to the split stack 14 in an alternating sequence. Normally closed anode flow<br>
shifting valves 50 and 52 are used to provide the anode flow-shifting. When the<br>
valve 50 is closed and the valve 52 is opened, hydrogen gas from the source 40<br>
flows into the stack 12 on the line 42, through a connector line 54 between the<br>
split stacks 12 and 14, into the split stack 14 and out the anode line 46 through<br>
the valve 52 to be mixed with the cathode exhaust gas in the cathode exhaust<br>
gas output line 28, Likewise, when the valve 52 is closed and the valve 50 is<br>
opened, hydrogen gas from the hydrogen source 46 flows into the split stack 14<br>
on the line 46, through the connector line 54, into the split stack 12 and through<br>
the valve 50 to be mixed with the cathode exhaust gas in the line 28.<br>
[0020] A water separator 60 is coupled to the connector line 54 and<br>
collects water in the anode gas flow between the split stacks 12 and 14. A<br>
normally closed drain valve 62 is periodically opened to vent the water to the<br>
cathode exhaust gas line 28 on line 64. Further, an anode exhaust gas purge<br>
valve 66 is coupled to the connector line 54 and the line 64 for reasons that will<br>
become apparent from the discussion below.<br>
[0021] The fuel cell stacks 12 and 14 generate current During<br>
normal stack operation, the current generated by the stacks 12 and 14 is used to<br>
drive system loads, such as an electrical traction system (ETS) 70 on a vehicle.<br>
During a shut-down sequence, the current generated by the stacks 12 and 14<br>
may be used to charge a battery 72, or be dissipated by other system<br>
components, and then be dissipated by a resistor 74.<br>
 <br>
[0022] For one system shut-down sequence, the compressor 16 is<br>
stopped and the valves 20 and 30 are closed to seal the cathode side of the<br>
stacks 12 and 14. The flow of hydrogen is continued so that any remaining<br>
oxygen in the stacks 12 and 14 is consumed. When the stack power drops to a<br>
predetermined level, the current generated by the stacks 12 and 14 is switched<br>
from the ETS 70 to the battery 72. When the stack power decreases to another<br>
predetermined level, the stack load is switched to the resistor 74. Particularly,<br>
once the voltage has degraded to a fixed cutoff voltage, the stack load is<br>
switched to the resistor 74. The cutoff voltage coufd be the lower limit of a<br>
DC/DC converter (not shown), or the lower limit of a power device. The objective<br>
of the battery load is to consume and/or store any energy that otherwise would<br>
have been wasted. It also reduces the energy consumption requirements of the<br>
resistor load.<br>
[0023] Once the oxygen has been consumed from the stacks 12 and<br>
14, the hydrogen flow is turned off and the valves 50, 52,62 and 66 are closed to<br>
seal the anode side of the stacks 12 and 14. When the system 10 is shut-down<br>
in this manner, the stacks 12 and 14 include an N2/H2 mixture in both the<br>
cathode side and the anode side. Over time, air will leak into the stacks 12 and<br>
14, and the hydrogen in the stack 12 and 14 will initially consume the oxygen.<br>
Additionally, the hydrogen will slowly leak out of the stacks 12 and 14. As a<br>
result, the composition of the gases within the stacks 12 and 14 will vary over<br>
time between a hydrogen rich mixture in nitrogen and water to an air mixture.<br>
[0024] According to the invention, a method is used to determine<br>
how long the fuel cell system 10 has been shut-down or a quick step has<br>
occurred so that an estimate of the gas concentration and constituency in the<br>
split stacks 12 and 14 can be obtained for a proper start-up sequence. The<br>
approximate gas concentration in the cathode side and anode side can be<br>
predicted overtime based on gas kinetics and assumptions about the system 10.<br>
By knowing the gas concentrations in the system during the time that the system<br>
10 is in stand by or is keyed off, certain methods can be employed to ensure that<br>
an optimized next start-up sequence takes place. There are certain<br>
 <br>
requirements that pertain to safety, emissions, reliability and durability that can<br>
be achieved by manipulating the states that defines the start-up sequence.<br>
[0025]	To accomplish this, the present invention proposes a stand-<br>
by timer that counts the time that the system 10 is off but the key is still in the<br>
vehicle ignition and is in the ON or accessory (ACC) position, and a shut-off timer<br>
that counts the time that the ignition is off. Therefore, both desired stops and<br>
quick stops of the system 10 can be covered to determine how much time has<br>
gone by since the last stack shut-down. When the system 10 is off, but the key is<br>
still in the ignition, the stand-by timer accumulates the time from when the system<br>
was shut-down. When the key is removed from the ignition, the stand-by time<br>
value is stored, and the shut-off timer is started. When the key is returned to the<br>
ignition and the system 10 is started, the stand-by time and the shut-off time are<br>
added to provide a complete off-time value for determining the gas concentration<br>
in the anode and cathode sides of the split stacks 12 and 14.<br>
[0026] If the off-time value is less than 500 seconds, the hydrogen<br>
concentration is high on the anode side and is being consumed. The anode<br>
pressure will be decreasing rapidly due to a high oxygen consumption rate. If the<br>
off-time value is between 500 and 1000 seconds, the hydrogen concentration in<br>
the anode side has declined due to continued oxygen consumption. The anode<br>
pressure provides a large vacuum due to reduced hydrogen concentration. If the<br>
off-time value is between 1000 and 10,000 seconds, the hydrogen in the anode<br>
side has continued to decline as oxygen in the cathode diffuses back into the<br>
anode side. The cathode concentration starts to decline after it peaks. The<br>
anode pressure recovers as nitrogen in the air enters the anode side to offset the<br>
partial pressure difference. If the off-time value is great than 10,000 seconds, the<br>
hydrogen concentration in the anode side is low, but continues to diffuse from the<br>
anode side to the cathode side. The anode pressure achieves ambient pressure<br>
as air enters the anode side.<br>
[0027] Figure 2 is a flow chart diagram showing a fuel cell system<br>
start-up process that employs the stand-by and shut-off time values. While the<br>
fuel cell system is in the off state at box 82, the shut-off timer is counting at box<br>
84. The fuel cell system 10 receives a start request at box 86, and the system<br>
 <br>
holds the shut-off time value at box 88. The compressor 16 is ramped up to<br>
provide dilution air at the stack output for the anode hydrogen gas from the<br>
anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14 at box 90. The system 10 determines<br>
whether a failed start, an aborted start, or a quick stop has occurred at decision<br>
diamond 92. If so, the shut-off timer resumes the count that has been held at<br>
box 94. If a failed start, aborted start or quick stop has not occurred at the<br>
decision diamond 92, the system 10 determines whether the anode pressure is<br>
greater than a predetermined value, such as 150 kPa, at decision diamond 96. If<br>
the anode pressure is greater than the predetermined value at the decision<br>
diamond 96, the system 10 proceeds to the next step in the start-up sequence<br>
that provides a cathode air fill to the cathode side of the split stacks 12 and 14<br>
and provides a differential anode side pressure set-point at box 98. The system<br>
10 then provides hydrogen gas flow to the anode side of the split stacks 12 and<br>
14 in parallel at box 100, and provides a normal run operation at box 102.<br>
[0028] If the anode side pressure is less than the predetermined<br>
value at the decision diamond 96, then the system start-up sequence provides a<br>
header purge for the anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14 at box 104. Once<br>
the anode pressure reaches a predetermined value, such as 107 kPa, at box<br>
106, the system 10 provides normal anode flow-shifting at box 108 and a stack-<br>
fill at box 110. The system operation then returns to the box 98 for a normal<br>
system operation.<br>
[0029] Figure 3 is a flow chart diagram 120 showing an operation for<br>
providing the stand-by time count and the shut-off-timer count discussed above<br>
during system shut-down. When the system 10 is running at box 122, the<br>
algorithm periodically determines whether there is a system shut-down at<br>
decision diamond 124. If there is a system shut-down at the decision diamond<br>
124, the algorithm determines whether a next start-up sequence has reached a<br>
certain state where cathode dilution air is being provided at decision diamond<br>
126. If the start-up sequence has not reached this state, then the stand-by timer<br>
continues counting from a previous stand-by count at box 132. If the start-up<br>
sequence has reached the cathode dilution state at the decision diamond 126,<br>
 <br>
then the algorithm sets the stand-by time to zero at box 128. The algorithm then<br>
starts incrementing the stand-by timer at box 130.<br>
[0030] The algorithm then determines if the ignition has been turned<br>
off at decision diamond 134. If the ignition has been turned off at the decision<br>
diamond 134, then the algorithm stops incrementing the stand-by time timer at<br>
box 136. The stand-by timer that provides the system off count while the ignition<br>
is on is stored. The shut-off timer now increments the time that the fuel cell<br>
system 10 has been shut-down.<br>
[0031] The algorithm then determines if the ignition has been turned<br>
on at decision diamond 138 after the previous shut-down of the fuel cell system<br>
10. If the ignition has not been turned on, then the shut-off timer continues to<br>
increment at the box 136. If the ignition has been turned on at the decision<br>
diamond 138, the algorithm determines if the shut-off time count is set to zero at<br>
decision diamond 140 to determine if there is a loss of battery power during the<br>
time the fuel cell system 10 was shut-down. If the shut-off time is not zero at the<br>
decision diamond 140, meaning that the timer had suitable power during the<br>
shut-down time, the algorithm adds the stored stand-by time to the stored shut-<br>
off time at box 142 to give the total off time that the split stacks 12 and 14 have<br>
been shut-down and sealed so that the algorithm can then determine the proper<br>
start-up sequence for the hydrogen flow to the anode side of the split stacks 12<br>
and 14. The off-time algorithm then returns to the decision diamond 134 to<br>
determine whether the ignition had been turned off. If the shut-off time is zero at<br>
the decision diamond 140, then the algorithm knows that battery power has been<br>
lost, and sets the shut-off time to zero at box 144.<br>
[0032] If there is not an ignition off event at the decision diamond<br>
134, the algorithm continually determines whether the system 10 has been<br>
started at decision diamond 146 and, if so, returns to the system running box 122<br>
to wait for the next system shut-down at the decision diamond 124. If the ignition<br>
is not off at the decision diamond 134, and there has not been a start-up event at<br>
the decision diamond 146, then the algorithm determines whether battery power<br>
has been lost at decision diamond 148 and, if not, increments the stand-by timer<br>
at the box 130. Thus, if the ignition has not been shut-off, there has not been a<br>
 <br>
start-up event and there has not a battery loss of power, the fuel cell controller is<br>
running, but the system 10 has not been is started. Thus, the stand-by time<br>
continues to increment. If there is a loss of battery power at the decision<br>
diamond 148, then the algorithm sets the shut-off timer to zero at box 150, and<br>
returns to the decision diamond 146 to wait for a start-up event.<br>

cell stack can be known for an efficient next system start-up sequence. The<br>
method uses two timers, a stand-by timer that provides a time count for how long<br>
the fuel cell system has been off, but the vehicle ignition is still on, and a shut-off<br>
timer that provides a time count of how long the vehicle ignition has been off.<br>
The two time counts are added to give a complete time count of how long the fuel<br>
cell stack has been shut-down.</td>
