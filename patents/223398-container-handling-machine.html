				<td>The invention refers to container treatment machines which are<br>
fitted with pick-up bins.<br>
The container treatment machines fitted with pick up bins<br>
introduced in the frame work of this application are planned in<br>
the first place for the treatment of containers made out of<br>
plastic as for example PET, like for example bottles which have<br>
a, so called neck ring. Further, the application of introduced<br>
pick up bins is of course also planned for all further suitable<br>
container types and likewise for further ancillary and / or<br>
supplementary packages like as for example in-and outlet stars,<br>
allocated to container treatment machines.<br>
Container treatment machines are as for example filling machines,<br>
sealing machines, rinser and the equivalent. In higher capacity,<br>
they are designed in rotating components, in doing so the<br>
treatment locations picking the container are assembled at the<br>
circumference of a so called rotary and while circulating carry<br>
along the containers during the treatment.<br>
The plastic containers provided with a neck ring, when they are<br>
empty or are located within the treatment machine , are then as<br>
rule handled and / or transported through so called neck<br>
handling.<br>
The supply of containers to the treatment machines takes place as<br>
a rule through known devices for air transport of such type<br>
containers. Inside the treatment machines the transport takes<br>
place with the help of transfer or transport stars, which are<br>
specially developed for the handling of containers provided with<br>
a neck ring.<br>
The transfer of containers from the air transport, in which the<br>
containers are transported in disordely condition without fixed<br>
division, to the transfer- or transport stars, which transport<br>
the containers in orderly condition and with fixed division,<br>
takes place under the use of known entry - or division worms,<br>
which isolate the containers standing in batch supported by the<br>
air transport, bring on division and followingly supply to an<br>
entry or transport star.<br>
The next step represents the transfer of containers from an inlet<br>
star to the rotary of a treatment machine.<br>
The required constructive designs for the solution of this<br>
assignment are determined in strong measure through the type of<br>
arresting of the container during the circulation with the rotary<br>
of the treatment machine.<br>
In case the containers as for example are arrested through grab<br>
which grip at the mouth area of these containers or rather at the<br>
neck ring, then as a rule the transfer- or entry stars show also<br>
corresponding grab, in doing so the transfer of containers from<br>
the inlet star to the rotary takes place mainly in the apparent<br>
contact points of both the pitch circles. Therein the release<br>
through the inlet star and the arresting through the rotary, are<br>
so tuned to each other from time and space point of view that the<br>
transfer takes place certainly quickly and flawlessly.<br>
In case the containers are arrested through grab which grip at<br>
the body of the containers, then the inlet stars do not show<br>
usual way any grab items but the so called star bins which first<br>
guide the containers safely with the assistance of external<br>
guidances and followingly transfer to the grab. In the first<br>
place the large number of necessary components and the high<br>
manufacture and maintenance costs connected with it are<br>
disadvantageous to the above introduced devices.<br>
In particular in the cold aseptic filling up, gaining always<br>
larger marked share, there results for such type devices a<br>
further main disadvantage, which exists therein that a greater<br>
expense must be incurred in order to hold such devices sterile in<br>
the running operation.<br>
For solution of the problem further patent right applications as<br>
for example DE 10340365.5 and DE 1036618.6 have been made<br>
available by the applicant, which in the first place deal with<br>
cold asceptic container treatment machines, and therein specially<br>
with the reduction of the number of components and reduction of<br>
necessary clean spaces.<br>
A further problem of such type, cold aseptic container treatment<br>
machines exists in the sterile air consumption and the cost<br>
connected with it.<br>
Among others also the above mentioned patent right applications<br>
of the applicant deal with the solution of this problem. In the<br>
frame work of this and further applications already many problems<br>
were solved. Mainly the sterile air loss remained till now non<br>
dealt which arise...........................................<br>
in known designs at the separating location between the circulating rotary of the container<br>
treatment machine or the allocated stars and the stationary inhousing.<br>
Known designs follow mainly the state of the art represented in the Figure 1. Therein at the<br>
in-and outlet stars, as well as in the rotary of the container treatment machines pick up bins<br>
are planned, which pick up the containers in doing so the containers are picked up at the<br>
piece of their neck, which is located below the neck ring.<br>
In known designs the pick up bins as a rule are designed in such a way that they can cover<br>
or pick up the container neck only upto its maximum diameter, in rare individual cases also<br>
few millimetre over and above that. Since this type of pick up does not guarantee a secure<br>
guiding of the containers, in such cases external guidances are compellingly necessary.<br>
These are developed and assembled on ground of available constructive circumstances in<br>
such a way that they touch the container neck at the side lying opposite to the pick up bins<br>
and consequently press the containers in the pick up bins or rather arrest them there.<br>
Through this procedure there results between in-or outlet stars, rotaries and external guidances<br>
allocated to these components - which can also be developed as in housing or as com-<br>
ponents - a gap whose breadth corresponds to nearly the half of container neck diameter.<br>
In usual containers the relevant neck diameter amounts to as for example 29 or 32 mm, so<br>
that the breadth of the gap lies in the order of magnitude of 14 or even 16 mm, which has<br>
the result, that such type container treatment machines have a high sterile air consumption.<br>
It is the assignment and the target of the present invention to demonstrate a device which<br>
certainly avoids the above mentioned disadvantages. For this the present invention intro-<br>
duces a container treatment machine in-or outlet stars and transfer stars which are fitted<br>
with special pick up bins, in doing so the introduced devices are applicable specially for<br>
container treatment machines corresponding to the above mentioned applications but not<br>
exclusively for such type container treatment machines.<br>
Through the special design of the pick up bins, it is made possible to realise a gap width<br>
near zero. Likewise an overall advantageous reduction of the pitch circle diameter of the<br>
treatment location is achieved.<br>
Such type of devices has not become known so far as per the status of knowledge of the<br>
applicant.<br>
In the following the invention is explained closer with the help of execution examples rep-<br>
resented in the diagram.<br>
Individually shows the<br>
Figure 1 in two highly simplified general layout diagrams first a rotary of a container<br>
treatment machine with a circle belonging to the state of the art, an external<br>
guidance for the container built as inhousing, an inlet star and a second<br>
external guidance allocated to this inlet star, in doing so the width of the<br>
gap is clear. Further a like wise pick-up bin belonging to the state of the<br>
art is represented and the<br>
Figure 2 in a simplified plan view an inlet star and a container treatment machine,<br>
in doing so both are fitted with pick up bins designed as per the invention<br>
and the<br>
Figure 3 in a simplified representation a device as per invention, in doing so a<br>
design is shown in which the container neck is not fully picked up by the<br>
pick up bin 5.<br>
Further developments advantages and application possibilities of the invention result from<br>
the following description of execution examples and the diagram. Therein all described<br>
and/or diagrammatically represented features form itself or in any combination the object<br>
of the invention, independent of their summary in the claims or their reflection. At the same<br>
time the content of the claims is made a constituent of the description.<br>
The Figure 2 shows first a circle segment of the rotary 2 of a container treatment machine<br>
1, in doing so it can deal with as for example a rinser or rather also with a sealer. In the<br>
represented execution example it deals with a filling machine of circulating design. The<br>
circulating part of the filling machine, the so called rotary 2 is executed ratable around the<br>
machine rotation axis 3.<br>
Through the inlet star 4 which is fitted with so called pick up bins 5, the containers 6 are<br>
supplied to the container treatment machine 1 in doing so an external guidance 7 supports<br>
or rather takes over the guidance of the containers 6 at least for a definite stretch section.<br>
It is planned to assemble an external guidance 7 likewise in the areas of rotary 2, where<br>
such one is necessary and/or useful.<br>
The present invention extends also on the design of the pick up bins 5 from rotary 2 and<br>
from transfer - and outlet stars. For the purpose of simplification, with regard to the pick<br>
up bins 5 from stars, followingly inlet stars 4 or stars are handle, in doing so they stand<br>
obviously on behalf of all relevant types of stars. Through it, that the pick up bins 5 are<br>
designed in specially advantageous way, it enables the present invention to reduce the gap<br>
dimension of gap 9 forming between external guidance 7 and rotary 2 or rather inlet star<br>
4 to a minor variable amounting to only few millimetre or even only fraction of millimetre.<br>
The substantial reduction of the gap dimension is clear in particular in a comparison<br>
between the Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The design of the pick up bins 5 follows in such away, that the container neck of the<br>
container 6 to be transported or picked up through star or rotary is fully or at least rather<br>
almost fully is picked up by the pick bins 5.<br>
Through this procedure it is achieved that the outer most point of the container neck forms<br>
a point of the planned circumferential circle of inlet star 4 or rotary 2 or projects out 1/10<br>
millimetre or rather also a few Vz millimeter over this planned circumferential circle.<br>
The position of the container neck determines decisively the breadth of the gap 9, in doing<br>
so it is attempted for the reduction of sterile air consumption, to achieve a smallest<br>
possible width of the gap 9. The smallest dimension to be realised results in the fully<br>
picked up container neck through the unavoidably appearing production - and container<br>
tolerances which must be considered in particular between circulating and non-moving<br>
machine components.<br>
The transition of the containers 6 from inlet star 4 to the rotary 2 takes place under assist-<br>
ance of carry over device 8.<br>
The transition happens first through it, that the containers 6 are pressed by the continuously<br>
rotating inlet star 3 against the carry over device 8. Since the carry over device 8 is<br>
designed stationary and non-moving, the container 6 with progressing rotation of the rotary<br>
2 and inlet star 4 is pushed out from the pick up bin 5 of theinlet star 4 and pushed inside<br>
the corresponding pick up bin 5 of the rotary 2.<br>
Through the extremely advantageous constructive design of the present invention the treat-<br>
ment stations located at the rotary 2, as for example rinsing heads, filling heads or even<br>
also the sealing heads - as usual till now - do not lie on the pitch circle diameter which<br>
goes through the (planned) contact point of inlet star 4 and rotary 2, but on an internal pitch<br>
circle diameter, which is clearly smaller.<br>
The realisable reduction of the pitch circle diameter of the treatment places amounts to<br>
about 2,1/2 container neck diameter.<br>
Through it, as for example the inhousings necessary in cold aseptic container treatment<br>
machines as a rule, otherwise mainly in unchanged dimension are additionally reduced,<br>
through which the sterile air requirement and the costs connected with the sterile mainte-<br>
nance during the running operation of such type installation can be reduced further.<br>
In a further design it is planned, to execute the pick up bins 5 in such way that the outer<br>
most point of the neck ring 10 of the container 6 picked up by rotary 2 or stars forms a<br>
point of the planned circumference circle by stars or rotary 2 or projects out a few 1/10<br>
millimeter or rather also a few Vz millimeter over this planned circumference circle.<br>
The advantage of a such design lies in a further possible reduction of the pitch circle<br>
diameter of the treatment locations, in doing so indeed on ground of changed geometrical<br>
circumstances there arises an increased but yet always less sterile air consumption in<br>
comparison to the state of the art.<br>
