Held of tliejiivcntion The invention relates to compositions and methods for controlling immune responds.<br>
Jiackgiound of the Invention<br>
The control of unwanted immune responses i$ \ critical issue in the treatment cf divi^35d.:3 such as autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, allergic diseases, and some ca-'K'.^-ij, The activity of overly aggressive T cells can be controlled by ur.mi'.nosuppression or by die induction of immunological tolerance, Tolerance is dot™*:, as a state where the immune system is made unresponsive to an antigen, whereas immunosuppression, which decreases the immune response :o antigens, usuji.l!.y requires the continued use of medication In organ transplantation, T cells play ar. e1 Sfrmtial role in the immune response to alloaatigsns. Current immunosuppressive r^hres commonly involve the use of cot ticosteroid, cyclosporin or rapamycin, which bloi.k \hz transcription of IL-2, a key gro'.vdi factor for T cells, or inhibit IL-2 dependent proliferation. H:&gt;wever» a number of monoclonal antibodies which either act asi T cell-depleting agents (e.g. C.D3, CD4, CDS)., or as inhibitors of'the cytokine aigrtiil ing or the c\&gt;stimu]a1:oj:y pathways of T calls (e.g. CD25, B7-1, B7-2, CD152, CT'L/k.4) have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the incidence of rejection with limitsd tide effects or toxicity. Some of these agents nave been shown to have some decree of success in treating autoimmune disease and in prolonging graft survival.<br>
Apoptosis is widely believed to he of vital importance for maintaining the proper function of the immune system and a major mechanism to remove unwanted cdis (Kabelite ei al Immunol. Today 14:338-340 (1993); Raff, Natu«:356:397-399 C! 99?.)). Various signals originating from either inside or outside a ceU influence the iifij. a;ad death of tiie ceil. Antibodies against'! :-ell surface molecules such as Fas (or<br><br>
CDW, MW = 43 kD), TNJFR2 (MW = 75 KD), CD2 (MW - 45 KD) and CTLA-4 (MW sa 3: kD) tc induce the apoptosis of T cells (Gsbonie, Cut:. Opin. Immunol, 8:245-248 (lPJift); Lin et a}. J. Immunol. 158:598-603 (1997); Zhang et al. Naturfc:377:348-35Q (ltttf); Lai &amp; al. Eur. J. Immunol 25:3243-3248 (199:1); Mollereau at al. J. Immunol. 156;:?i:?4-3190 (1996); Gribixm et al. Proe. Natl. Acad. Sri. USA 92:&amp;il-815 (1995)). Attempts to use Fas and TNFR2 molecules to control unwantedT cells have been hampeied by the fact chat these two molecules are expressed not only on immune cells, bin: al:;i! on several other important organ systems like liver. This expression pattern pot-; r:i;;illy limits the therapeutic application of these two antibodies (Ogasawara et ah N3.1i're 364:306-809 (1993); Pfeffer et al. Cell:73:457-467 (1993); Engelmann et al. J. Bi:-I ogfcal Chemistry 265:14497-14504 (1990)),<br>

Detailed Description The invention is directed to methods of modulating T cell activity by me:! ilAdnjg the function of PSGL-1 molecules residing on the surface of a T cell. Engagement of PSGL-1 with compositions described herein can cause the depletion of T cfil'M and'or induce T ceils *:o undergo apoptosis. These compositions arc ihercfoie useful as therapeutic agents for controlling immune-related conditions such as autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, allergic diseases, and/or T cell-derived ca'osarc. The compositions arcs also useful in causing the depletion of T cells from acy biological sample where the presence ox activity of T cells is not desired.<br>
PSGL-1 is ? cell surface adhesion moleculs ".hat is expressed on neutrophils, T ?.) id B-lymphcsiytes, NE crils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and primitive human Ct&gt;34 hematopoietic progenitor cells. Through its ability to jmeract with seleatins, PSGL-1 mediates the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium and the extravasation of lev.kocyifi5 into raff.amed tissues  PSGL-l-rnediated binding of T cells to E- and P-sek-cva, or migration, is differentially regulated. For instance, the. appearance of CLA (cupreous .lymphocyte ant gen) epitope is thought to be induced on T cells undergoing naive to memory transition. Only activated helper 1 but not helper' 2 T cells express functional PSGL-1 and it capable of migration into die inflamed area of the skin.<br>
PSGL-1 is a sialomucin that must he specifically sialylated, fucosylated, and <svt fated to bind p-selectin. the psgl-1 molecule exists in isoftwrns characterized by di t degree of glycosylation and sulfation at their n-tcnnirj resting m ipltergj. blood b cells lymphoid cell lines vtiro activated peripheral hk-od ceils express sixniiar level pgsl-l yet only display a ivnctional form psol-i raid avidly p such activavion-dependent></svt><br>
binding activity appears to be s. result cf differential past-transialionai modification, as suggiustsd by elevated levels of alpha (1,3) fucosylii&amp;nsferases activities in activated T celk- P'SGLrl isofonns also show differential affinity to L-setectin and E-selectin. For msun:.cw, human T cells exhibiting the CLA-positive isoforai can tether and roll on both B- iind. P-selectin, while T eel la expressing PSGL-I \vi:hout the CLA epitope only bind to .P-i-eJsotiri. Furthermore, binding of PSGL-1 tc P-selectin is contingent upon the piesence of the terminal decapeptide that contains threa tyrosine residues for sulfadon ana OIK: threonine residue for glycosylation,<br>
A PSGL-1 protein can be prepared by recombinant methods and/or by isolating a TiFt.i-ve PSGL-1 protein from biological material A recombinant PSGL-1 protein can be ]i::c:iuced in prokaryodc or eukaryotic tells, either in vitro or in vivo* Nucleic acids ens:: ding PSGL-1 can be used for recombinant production of the protein (see, e.g., GmUankO Accession NMJ303006 for an example of a nucleic acid deeding a PSGL-1 polypeptide). Antibodies directed to PSGL-1 are also well known and can be used for purification of the antigen (see, e.g., Herron et aL (2000) Science Juo 2;i:" 3(;:i47l); 1653-56; WO 0Q'25B0S) and/or used in Methods described herein. PSGL-1 if' /uither described in references including but nor limited to Sako et al, (1993) Cell 75:117?; Vachino et ah (1995) J. Biol. Chan. 270:21966; and Vekkn ;n ec d, (1993) J.<br>
B.::i.:::rieml 270:16470.<br>
For recombinant production of PSGL-1, the siamltsaeous expression of both P': CL-1 and its modifying alpha- (1,3) fucosylb-aMerase, Fuc-TVU, umy be required t\v ih» functional expression of FSGL-1. In addition or alternatively, recombinant pr:.c.cMion of PSGL-1 may be accompanied by co-traasfection with a nucleic acid encoding PACE for removing the propeptide and/or or a nucleic acid encoding tyrosine sulfoUansferase.<br>
An anti-PSGL-1 antibody can be used to isolate and purify a PSGL-1 antigen flora ecological na'cerial. A.:ay cell type expressing a PSGL-1 protein, e.g., X cells dc.iiv-ir-ii from an individual or a T cell line, can be used as a source of the protein. Once p.died, the protein can be used m a variety of methods as described herein. For e&gt;':urrple, the purified PSGL-]. protein cars be used in an in vitro screen of moaulatots of PSCL-l function 0"?. T cells or as an iiamunogen to prepare antibodies directed against<br><br>
In addition aPSGL-1 antigen can be purified using a selectin-Fc fusion, e.g., a P-s e!::et:n-Fc fusion.<br>
Ask. PSGL JLA mibodies.<br>
PSGL-1 polypeptides (or immunogenic tfragatsnts or analogs thereof) can be use:;, io generate antibodies useful in the methods of the invention. As described above, PSGL-1 polypeptides or peptide fragments thereof cin bss produced by recombinant teeluixj;.es or synthesized using solid phase synthesis methods. The recombinant PS0L4 polypeptides or a peptide-; fragrant thereof can be used. a3 an iirmunogen to prod.xc: anti-PSGL-1 antibodies. In addition, an anti-PSGLrl antibody, such as the TAH1 monoclonal antibody, can be used to purify a PSGL-1 polypeptide, e.g., a PSGL-1 pvlypsiptide in its natural conformation, which een then be used as an immunogen to prtfdi:-c* additional anti-PSGLrl antibodies.<br>
An antibody of the invention can be a monoclonal polyclonal, o:: engineered anybody that specifically binds to a PSGL-1 polypeptide. An antibody that !'spE.dfi::aily binds;1' to a particular antigen, e.g., a PSGL-1 polypeptide, will not subii;;i;v:ially recognize or bind to other molecules in a sample. Thus, the inventior also fei;l;.i:cj: methods tor identifying a test compound (e.g., an antibody) thst binds to a polyjiq-tide of the invention by contacting Che polypeptide with a tesr compound and de;n::T:inmg whether the polypeptide bind* to che test compound (e.g., by direct deca, fion of the binding, detection of a competitor molecule- which disrupts binding of the i-si compound to tlie polypeptide, and/or detection of binding using an assay for apoptcsiis-indudns activity).<br>
In general, PSGL-1 polypeptides can be coupled to a carrier protein, su'ch as KL.r*. rixed with ar. adjuvant, and injected into a host mrarmal. Antibodies produced in ■■Jv.d: minimal can then be purified by peptide antigen affinity chromatography.<br>
In particular, various host animals can be immunized by inject on with a PSGL-1 f ):ypeptide or an antigenic fragment thereof. Commonly employed host animals inca-ii i&amp;bbits, mice, guinea pigs, and rat1?.. Various adjuvants tha ca;i be used to inert £3;:i the immunological ■response depend on the best species and include Freund's adju /:?nt (complete and incomplete}, roineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active irobstances sush as lysolecithin, phrenic poiyols, polyar/ions, peptides, oil eir.x *ions&gt; keyhole limpet htsanocyanin, and dirut:ophenol. Potentially useful human<br><br>
adjuvants include BCG (bacijle Caknctte-Ouerin) and Coiynebacteriuin pawum. Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules that are coririn.sd in the sera of the- immunized animals,<br>
Antibodies within the invention therefore include polyclonal antibodies and, in a<kltionf raonocloiial antibodies humanized or chimeric single chain ami bodies fab fragments f and molecules produced using a exprr-asion library></kltionf>
Monoclonal antibodies, which are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a patii..;uiar antigen, can be prepared using thePSGL»l f olypeptides described above and st&amp;r.'L&amp;rd hybridoma technology (see, for example, Kohler ex al, Nature 256:495 U^'ST.

The antibodies can be used, for example, as part of a therapeutic regime (e.g., ic rfiduoe o: eliminate an undesirable immune response, such as a T cell mediated inuauns jx'spcmse, associated with conditions such 34 autoimmune- diseases, transplant rejection,<br><br>
allergic diseases, and T cell-derived cancers). Antibodies also can be used in a screwing assay to measure the. ability of a candidate compound to biud to PSGL-1.<br>
Li addition, technique;; developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies" (Monison et ai: Proe Natl Acad Sci USA 81:6851 [1984]; Neuberger et ai,, Nature 312:604 [1984]; Takeda et al., Nature 314:452 [19845) by splicing the genes from a moiiS'ii antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a hum an antibody molecule of appropriate biologies! activity can be used. A chimeric antibody ia a molecule in wh::ch different portions are deiived from different animal .spe-d'-ss, such as those having a variable region derived from a rnurine raonoclonal antibody and a human inmuttoglobulin constant region.<br>
Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (US. Put. Nos. 4,94-5,778,4,946,778, and 4,704,692) can be adapted to oroduce single chs-ir antibodies against a PSGL-1 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via a. a amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain -polypeptide.<br>
Antibody fragments that recognize and bind 4;o specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include but are not Hnu'ici-. to F(ab')2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody tno"i':!Cule, and Fab fragments, tha1; can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of F(;ib )2 fragment*;.

The principle of the assays used to identify compounds that bind to PSGL-l invr-ivca preparing a reaction irtixture of PSGL-1 (or a domain thereof) and the test compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to intec -id fjici bind, thus forming a complex which can b« removed and/or detected in the rem;uou mixture. The PSGL-1 species used cat) vary depending upon ths goal of the scTCif-sning assay. In some situations it is preferable to employ a peptide corresponding to a domain of PSGL-1 fused to a heterologous protein or polypeptide that affords adwvn.tiigeE; in the assay system (e.g., labeling, isolation of die resulting complex, etc.) C*\J ':&gt;■:&gt; utilized.<br>
Ths screening assays can be conducted in a variety of ways. For example, one rri-t 101 to conduct such an assay involves anchoring PSGL-1 protein, polypeptide, p.r:)' Lb or fusion protein or ths test substance onto a solid pha.se and detecting PSGL-1 /t;j r, compound complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction- In on: embodiment of such a method, the PSGL-1 reacuim may be anchored onto a solid s^d'p.C':?, and the us; compound, which is not anchored, may be labeled, either directly or i Erectly,<br>
"In practice, microtitsr plates may conveniently be utilized as the solid phase. Tlr anchored component may be immobilized by non-covalsnt or covalent &amp;.::i:ich:coents. Non-covalent attachment may be accomplished by simply coating the s;:!!(! iiurfaoewith a solution of the piotein and drying, Alternatively, an immobdized ;m' Lbody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, specific for the protein to be immobilized r:ii:.) :;ie used to anchor the protein to the solid surface. The surfaces may be prepared in jjd /;;.ji.ce and stored.<br>
In order to conduct the assay, the nomminobilized component is added to the ■;:c :r:t:d surface containing the anchored component. After ths reaction is complete, ursveacted cornporente are removed (e.g., by washing) under conditions such that any<br><br>
c:or minxes formed will remain immobilized on ;he solid surface. The aer.eetion of conpb:<es anehorad on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. whs i previously non-immobilized component is pre-labeled detection label immobilized indicates that complexes wexe formed wh non-immobilised not an indirect used to detect anchored e.g. using labeled antibody specific for turn may directly or indirectly with anti-ig></es>
Alternatively, a reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase, the reaction produce separated from unrsactsd components, and complexes detected; e.g., using an imrr:civilized antibody specific for PSGL-1 proton, polypeptide, peptide: or fusion prot'Mr. or the test compound t3 anchor any complexes formed in solution, and a labeled anybody specific for the other component of the possible complex to ietect anchored co['ftp&gt;!xe&amp;.<br>
Alternatively, cell-biased assays can be used to identify compounds that interact with PSGL-i. To this end, cell lines that express PS&amp;L-l, or cell lines that have been genetically engineered to express PSGL-1 can be used, Cell based assays are pa:lioUarly useful for evaluating the functional effect of a compound identified by a sccean described hssrein, Fo:; oxample, once a compound is identified based upon its al: ilJt;y to bind to a PSGL-1 protein, the compound can then be tested fov it? ability to, c. ;!'... induce T ceil upoptosh; in vitro or in vivo or deplete T ceils in vtro or in vivo.<br>

Bxairi;c.[;::.3_: Usa_oj an Anu-TAJP Antibody to Prevent Transplant Rejection<br>
.Vlice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory) at 8 to 12 weeks of a^e were taetfthotiized with Acepromazin indite (Fennenta Animal Health Co., Kansas City, MO'. Frio; to skin grafting, Ticn-ihymectomized recipisnt C57BL/6 mica (H-2b) were injected intraperitoneal^ with :500 ug of TAB4 or isotype control antibodies seven days 'uef 00 skin transplant smgery. Severn days later, a lateral flank of skin from fully aIk)j:*-iMi.«:dc mismatched Balb/cj rales (H-2d) was graftsd. on the lateral flank of the antibody pre-tieated C57BL/6 mice. Seven days post transplantation, the mice were agtb. fc;,ected with 500 ug of TAB4 or isotype control antibody. The mice were tnc: ji'ored every day after graft transplantation. The grafts "were considered rejected \vheri 50% donor skin was necrotic. The percent of graft survival is shown in Fig. 7 (n-sS;. The data show that TAB4 antibody treatments prolonged the survival of the alk;}i:A!'3ic skin graft-3.<br>
£xtr::i.ple 9' Identification of TA1P as PSGL-I<br>
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), also named CD 162, is the main P-siE].:3i:;:;in ligand expressed o:n leukocytes, including T cells (Sako et al. (1993) Cell 751 H9; Vachino et ah (1995) J. Biol. Cfcem. 270:21966; Veldrnan ei al. (1995) 1 Bio'. Chem. 270:16470). Biochemical characteristics of TAIP, such as its molecular wa.jj it and its tendency for dirnerization suggested the possibility that TAB4 may be analogous 1:0 PSGL-1. To investigate the relationship between these two antigens, the foLo iving were tested; 3) whether the antigen precipitated by TAB4 can be recognized by ii: ■jo;runercial'Iy-a.vailable and-PSGL1 antibody; and 2) wheiher an anti-PSGLl anciboc.y can deplete TAB4 from the cell lysate.<br>
RL^i T cells ware lysed at a density of 1.0 x 10s cells/ml in lysis buffer (1% Tritr:-iX-1Q0, 20 raM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,160 roM Nad, 1 mM CaCI*) containing compete protease inhibitor cocktail for i hour, and insoluble material was pelleted at I0.0u0 x g for 10 minutes. These and all subsequent steps were perfomied ai 4°C. The lysate corresponding to 5.0 x 101 cells was incubated with 20 ul of protein G-Sepliarose prc:!cfg.c!ed with 10 ug of anti-PSGL-1 mAb (clone 2PE1, PharMSngeti- San Diego, CA),<br><br>
anti-TAlP mAb, TAB4, or IgG from normal hamster serum. After incubation for 4 hcu:cs at 4'3C, the beads were washed five times with washing buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 50 HUM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5,400 mM NaCl, 1 JDM CaCl2( 1 xog/ml ovalbumin), and twice v/:ith a similar washing buffer, containing 250 rotoiinstead of 400 n-M NaCl , Bound proteins were eluted with 40 ul of IxSDS sample buffer. Ehted proteins were separated by 6 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose ineaabrfriG. The mercibrsnes were hninunoblotted with anti-PSGL-1. mAb, and revealed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H-fL) followed by chenulununcscence (Renaissance, NEN).<br>
Surface biotinylated flLtf 1 T cells were lyaed at a density of 1.0 x 10B cells/ml ;tn lyei'fi buffer. The cell extract was incubated with 20 ug of antibody bound to 40 ul of profit G-Sephaiose at 4°C overnight. Depletions were done with anti-PSGL-1 raAb (2PK I) or control ra: IgG, with TAS4 or control normal hamster sensm&gt; Depleted lysa'^s were further .subjected to do inrmunoprecipitation with TAB4 cr anti-PSGL-1 icA.b, respectively. Iniinunotirscipfcates were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel ma detected by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 6, anti-PSGL-1 antibody can deplete TAIP protein from T cell lysites.  In addition, protein* immunoprecipitated with anti-TA:P antibody (TAB4) can be recognized by anti-PSGL-1 antibody by western amrJysiii.<br>
£y -iiDLe .10: Induction of Apfiptosis in Human T Crihby an anti-gStJL-1 Antibody<br>
To determine the role, played by PSGL-1 in the apoptosis of human T cells, tin:.ii course experiments we;:e earned out to investigate when activated riutnan T cells acq'jur* sensitivity toward PSGL-I*mediated apoptotic signals, Human T cells' were stimulated with pbytohenjagglutinin (PHA) niirogen and further expanded in IL-2-contakring medium. Activated T cells were harvested and then challenged with anti-PSGL-1 in the presence of IL-2 and cross-linking antibodies.<br>
Human peripheral blood was taken from healthy adults, heprini2.ed, and etr'.uhcd for peripheral blood a^ononuclear cells (PEMO) based on differential density usiivg Ficoll-PaqL'.e Plus (Pharmacia Biotech). The PBMC were activate with 1% PHA (Lih Technologies, GibcoBRL) for 48 hour.* and subsequently maintained in 3$wn;binani him:ari IL-2 (5 ng/ml) through the assay period. To assess the apoptosis -inducing ability an anti-human PSGL-1 antibody, the activated cells were treated with;<br><br>
(1) I -tig /ml of the aatMPSGL-1 antibody clone KPL-1 (BD PharMingea) plus cross-licitec rabbit anti-mouse Ig (0.5 ug /ml) (Jackson taj&amp;unoResearchLaboratories); (2) isotype control purified mouse Ig plus cross-linker rabbit aiiti-mouse Ig; or (3) cross-linka: rabbit anti-mouse Ig done. After six hours of treatment, the percentage of early apopmtic cells was determined by FACS, staining with anti-Aimexin V (BD Plmt'Ivliagen) and PI (Sigma).<br>
A,5 shown in Fig. 8, signaling triggered by FSGL-1 using an anti-PSGL-1 antbc; dy plus the crosslinks triggered significant level of apoptosis m PHA-activatec frjman PBMC (nifcinly T cells). The percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 8.5'H c:' days 3 to 24% on day 8 in sati-PSGLl treated cultures. Neither isotopio-matched central, nor the cross-linking antibodies alone, had any effect on these cells.<br>
fr;c-;irrrpte. 11: Use of antirP;iGL-l Agonist Antibody .o Treat Autoimmune Disease<br>
Non-obe=se diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-accepted autoimmune diabetes animal, we::u bred under standard conditions. Spontaneous diabetes developed in the NOD i:.ri as at the age of about 20 weeks. In the experimental group, the mice received three d:)W!; of anti-PSGL-1 antibody (TAB4) intraperitoneally at 300 |xg per mouse at age of ] 1, 13 and 17 weeks. Two additional injections with the same dose were given at the .;..!£ :*;. of 24 and 26 weeks. The control group was given liatnster Ig at the same doss, M'.ci were monitored for glucose aria by Mali-Test Glucose strips (Macherey-Nagel, Q^xt iany) twice every weak after the aae of 15 weeks. Non-fasting urine glucose lovels over 300 rog/d] for two consecutive measurements were considered diabetic.<br>
As shown in Fig, 9, TAB4 (anti-PSGL-1) antibody treatment yielded significant jimtccticvri as compared with control antibody treatment. Thus an anti-PSGL-1 i?.r...tibody treatment can dampen the activity of autoimmune T cells and delay the onset ■:i'i;y;?ej!-diabei:es.<br>
