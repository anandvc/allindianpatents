The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
	This invention relates generally to portable communications devices, and more particularly to portable phones, such as cordless phones and cellular phones. <br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Portable phones are widely used for communicating and transmitting information between users. Portable phones include cordless phones which receive signals from a base station controlled by a user over a relatively short range, typically on a frequency of 900MHz, 2.4Ghz or 5.8GHz.  Portable phones also include cellular phones for a greater range, which typically receive signals from a telecommunications network using various platforms, such as ANALOG, CDMA, TDMA and GSM.  Portable phones also include satellite phones, where the portable phone is in direct transmission to and from a communications satellite orbiting the earth, such as the “GLOBAL STAR” system and the “IRIDIUM” system.  <br>
Some portable phones employ a handset configured for holding in one hand and placement against the user’s head.  A conventional handset for a portable phone includes a speaker configured for placement proximate to the ear, and a microphone configured for placement proximate to the mouth.  <br>
The handset can also include a face having a key pad, and a direct view display configured to display a visual image of data in an alphanumeric or video format.  Some types of data that can be visually displayed on the direct view display are “caller waiting ID” data.  Moreover, the data can be displayed, even when the user is conducting a two way conversation with the handset held against the head.  For example, during a two way conversation, the data can include the originating phone number of an incoming call.<br>
One limitation of a conventional handset is that the direct view display cannot be seen by the user with the handset held against the head. During a two way conversation, in order to view the data, the user must hold the handset away from the ear, and place the direct view display at least several inches in front of the eyes. This requires interrupting a two way conversation to read data from a third party during the conversation, such as caller waiting ID data.  Although this problem can be avoided by speaker phones, this approach has limitations, in that confidentiality and sound fidelity are reduced, and the transmission of environmental noises is increased.  <br>
The present invention is directed to a portable phone having a data projection system configured to generate and project a visual image of data onto a viewing surface which is in close proximity to the user, and easily viewable by the user.  This permits the visual image to be ergonomically viewed by the user even with the handset held against the head. Two way phone conversations can thus be carried out without interruption, and without the limitations of speaker phones. <br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
	In accordance with the present invention a portable phone, and a method for displaying data in a portable phone, are provided.<br>
	The portable phone includes a handset configured for holding in a user’s hand, and placement against the head during a two way conversation.  The handset includes a speaker, a microphone, a keypad, and a direct view visual display on a front surface thereof.  In addition, the handset includes a battery, and a pair of charging contacts for the battery on a bottom end surface thereof.  Further, the handset includes conventional phone circuitry configured to generate and display a first visual image of data on the direct view visual display.<br>
The handset also includes an image projection system configured to form a second visual image on a viewing surface, such as a body part of the user, which is easily viewable during the phone conversation with the handset held against the head.  In addition, the image projection system can be operated by manipulation of the handset, and by selection and manipulation of the viewing surface, such that the second visual image can be focused, enlarged, compressed, moved or moved to another viewing surface. <br>
The image projection system includes an electro optic system configured to generate a pattern corresponding to the second visual image.  The image projection system also includes an optics system configured to process the pattern into a mirror image and to project the mirror image onto the viewing surface, which is then reflected to the user to form the second visual image. The image projection system is an integral fixed element of the handset, which eliminates the need for additional mechanical elements, and allows the second visual image to be easily located using subtle and intuitive user manipulation of the hands or other body parts.  In this regard, the image projection system is optically configured to project along a vector that is controlled by manipulation of the handset about the user’s head, such that the second visual image can be projected into the user’s field of view with the speaker in proximity to the ear, and the microphone in proximity to the mouth.  Stated differently, the handset, and the viewing surface as well, can be manipulated to provide a focused and readable second visual image in close proximity to the user.  However, the handset can also be manipulated to provide privacy, or an unreadable second visual image if required, or to make the second visual image viewable by persons other than the user.      <br>
In a first embodiment, the electro optic system includes a light source in light communication with a first set of optics and a light valve, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), configured to generate the pattern.  In a second embodiment the electro optic system includes an emissive display, such as an addressable patterned LED display, an electroluminescent display, a cathode ray tube, or a field emission display, configured to generate the pattern.  The optics system includes a second set of optics, which can include a single optical element (e.g., positive convex lens, positive Fresnel lens), or multiple optical elements configured to process the pattern from the electro optic system into the mirror image of the second image and to project the mirror image onto the viewing surface. <br>
The image projection system can also be configured to orient the second visual image such that it can be read by the user from left to right, regardless of whether the handset is held against the left ear or the right ear.  As such, the image projection system can include a sensing device configured to sense an orientation of the handset, and to orient the second visual image as a function of the orientation of the handset.  For example, with the handset held in the user’s left hand against the left ear (i.e., left hand orientation), the second visual image can be oriented for left to right reading on the user’s right hand, wrist or forearm.  Similarly, with the handset held in the user’s right hand against the right ear (i.e., right hand orientation), the second visual image can be oriented for left to right reading on the user’s left hand, wrist or forearm.<br>
The image projection system can also include a pulsing circuit configured to pulse the second visual image from a bright image to a low image, or to a no image.  The pulsing circuit reduces power consumption and heat generation by the image projection system.  However, because of the way the human eye perceives and processes light, the high to low pulsing sensation results in the user perceiving a higher brightness, than the actual brightness averaged over the pulses.     <br>
The method for displaying data includes the steps of: providing the handset having the image projection system,  holding the handset against the head of the user, conducting a two way conversation using the handset with the handset held against the head, transmitting data to the image projection system during the two way conversation, forming a pattern representative of the data using the image projection system, processing the pattern into a mirror image of the second visual image using the image projection system, and then projecting the mirror image from the handset onto the viewing surface using the image projection system.  <br>
The method can also include the step of moving the handset about the head during the conversation to locate the second visual image on the viewing surface, or another selected viewing surface.  In addition, the method can also include the steps of: providing the handset with a sensing system, sensing an orientation of the handset using the sensing system, and then projecting the second visual image onto the viewing surface with an orientation dependent on the sensed orientation of the handset.  As an alternative to the sensing system, a user may manually select a left hand or a right hand orientation for the second visual image.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
     	Referring to Figures 1A-1C, Figures 2A-2C and Figures 3A-3F, a portable phone 10 constructed in accordance with the invention is illustrated.  In the description to follow, drawing figures for reference numerals are sometimes indicated in parenthesis following the reference numerals.  However, each reference numeral appears several times throughout the drawings, and are illustrated in more than just the parenthesized figures.  <br>
The portable phone 10 (Figure 1A) can be in the form of a cordless phone or a cellular phone.  In the illustrative embodiment, the portable phone 10 comprises a Uniden, model EXI-976 900mhz cordless phone manufactured by Uniden Corporation of Tokyo, Japan, which has been modified to include an image projection system 44 (Figure 1B).  However, the present invention is not limited to a Uniden cordless phone, as the concepts herein can be adapted to the construction of any type of cordless or cellular phone.  Also in the illustrative embodiment, the portable phone 10 has a unitary construction.  However, the concepts of the invention are applicable to portable phones having a hinged or articulated construction.    <br>
	The portable phone 10 (Figure 1A) includes a handset 12 (Figure 1A) formed of a rigid material such as molded plastic.  The handset 12 comprises a hollow support structure adapted to contain various components of the portable phone 10 (Figure 1A), and has a size and shape suitable for holding by a user 14 (Figure 4A).  In addition, the handset 12 includes a front surface 16 (Figure 1A), a back surface 18 (Figure 1B), a bottom end surface 20 (Figure 1C) and a longitudinal axis 54 (Figure 4B).  The handset 12 also includes an internal compartment 22 (Figure 1B) having a removable cover 24 (Figure 1B).  The internal compartment 22 is proximate to the bottom end surface 20 (Figure 1C) of the handset 12, and the cover 24 (Figure 1B) forms a portion of the back surface 18 (Figure 1B) of the handset 12.  The handset 12 (Figure 1C) can comprise a unitary assembly substantially as shown, or alternately can include one or more separable, hinged or articulated pieces.<br>
	The portable phone 10 also includes a speaker 26 (Figure 1A), and a microphone 28 (Figure 1A) having access openings on the front surface 16 (Figure 1A) of the handset 12.  Further, the portable phone 10 includes an antenna 30 (Figure 1A) configured to send and receive signals.  In addition, the portable phone 10 includes a key pad 32 (Figure 1A) on the front surface 16 (Figure 1A) of the handset 12 (Figure 1A) configured for manipulation by the user 14 (Figure 4A) for inputting data and performing various functions of the portable phone 10.  <br>
The portable phone 10 also includes phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B) in the handset 12 configured to generate data, such as caller waiting ID data, and a direct view display 34 (Figure 1A) on a front surface 16 of the handset 12 configured to display a first visual image 35 (Figure 1A) of the data.  The phone circuitry 38 can comprise conventional cordless or cellular phone circuitry constructed and operated using protocols that are known in the art.  By way of example, US Patents Nos. 6,418,209, 6,125,277 and 5,987,330 which are incorporated herein by reference disclose representative phone circuitry. <br>
The portable phone 10 also includes a battery 42 (Figure 1B) in signal communication with the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B) configured to provide power for various components of the portable phone 10.  A pair of external contacts 36 (Figure 1C) on the bottom end surface 20 (Figure 1C) of the handset 12 are configured for mating electrical engagement with a handset receptacle (not shown) for charging the battery 42 (Figure 1B).  The battery 42 (Figure 1B) can comprise a conventional rechargeable power source, such as a NiCad battery, a nickel metal hydride battery, a lithium-ion battery, or a fuel cell, configured to provide a selected amount of power for a selected time period.  In the illustrative embodiment, the battery 42 (Figure 1B) is configured to provide from 3.4 to 4.0 volts, and 600-900 mAh.<br>
The portable phone 10 also includes the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) in the internal compartment 22 (Figure 1B), and an on/off button 40 (Figure 1A) configured to turn the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) on and off.  The image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) is configured to generate and project a second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) representative of data, such as caller waiting ID data, onto a viewing surface 48 (Figure 3B).  In the illustrative embodiment, the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) is configured to project the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) along an optical axis 52 (Figure 3A) projecting from the bottom end surface 20 (Figure 2B) of the handset 12.  Although other arrangements can be used, the illustrative arrangement facilitates moving and focusing of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) when the portable phone 10 is held against a head 80 (Figure 4A) of the user 14 (Figure 4A).  In use, the portable phone 10 can be rotated about an ear 92 (Figure 4A) or 94 (Figure 5A) of the user 14 (Figure 4A), such that the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) can be conveniently located and focused in front of one or both eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4A) of the user 14 (Figure 4A).<br>
As shown in Figure 3D, in the illustrative embodiment, the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) is configured to project a mirror image 46’ of the second visual image 46 with an orientation leaving the handset 10 that is generally perpendicular, or orthogonal, to the front surface 16 and the back surface 18 of the handset 12.  In this case, the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) also includes an orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 3E) configured to sense the orientation of the handset 10 (i.e., left hand or right hand), and to orient the mirror image 46’ of the second visual image 46 with either orientation A (Figure 3D) or orientation B (Figure 3D), such that the second visual image 46 reads in both cases from left to right on the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3B).  <br>
As shown in Figure 1B, the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) includes a base 56 (Figure 1B) configured to mount various components of the system within the internal compartment 22 (Figure 1B) of the handset 12.  The base 56 (Figure 1B) can comprise an electrically insulating material, such as plastic, having a required size and shape.  In addition, a plurality of fasteners 62 (Figure 1B), such as threaded screws, plastic weld points, snaps or pins, can be used to attach the base 56 (Figure 1B) to the handset 12.<br>
As also shown in Figure 1B, the image projection system includes an electro optic system 45 configured to generate a pattern 46” (Figure 3F) representative of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) responsive to signals from the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B).  The electro optic system 45 (Figure 1B) includes a light source 58 (Figure 1B), which may be a polychromatic or monochromatic source of light having a wavelength of from 400 to 800 nanometer.  <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the light source 58 (Figure 1B) comprises a light emitting diode (LED) protruding from a sealed enclosure 78 (Figure 2B) mounted to the base 56 (Figure 2B).  As shown in Figure 3F, the light source 58 also includes a substrate 136, an LED chip 138 surrounded by a soft gel 140, a lens 142 which directs light forward for further processing and usage in the image projection system 44, and a lens mounting block 144 for mounting the lens 142.  The substrate 136 is configured to provide an assembly platform for the light source 58 and electrical feeds to the LED chip 138.  In addition, the substrate 136 provides a heat sink for the LED chip 138 directly from the LED chip 138, and from the LED chip 138 through the gel 140 to the substrate 136 as well.  <br>
The gel 140 conducts heat emitted by the LED chip 138 to the mounting block 144 and to the substrate 136, where it is dissipated.  In addition, the gel 140 provides a cushion against CTE mismatch cracking of the LED chip 138, and an optical index matching medium for efficiently coupling the light output of the LED chip 138 to the optical train.  In use, the gel 140, the mounting block 144 and the substrate 136 improve the performance of the light source 58.  This allows the image projection system 44 to form the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) in a dim or a bright setting, and with the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3B) having irregular contours and low reflectivity.  With regards to the improved performance, the substrate 136 has a direct physical/thermal contact with the back of the LED chip 138, and includes a metal layer (not shown) on a back surface thereof, which functions as a heat sink for the LED chip 138.  <br>
The mounting block 144 is made of solid copper treated with a reflective coating.  As with the substrate 136, the mounting block 144 also functions as a heat sink for the LED chip 138.  In addition to functioning as a heat sink and a structure for mounting the lens 142, the mounting block 144 also provides a cavity for the gel 140, and a reflection mechanism for transmitting light which is on a trajectory away from the lens 142 back to the gel 140.  Also in the illustrative embodiment, a flexible heat conductive matting (not shown) is placed against the light source 58 to further enhance cooling.  Suitable heat conductive matting are products “WSF 16” and “WSF 32” manufactured by Fisher Electronik GmBH, having sales representation in the United States through ICS International Circus Sales, Inc. of Phoenix, AZ. <br>
One suitable light source 58 comprises a high brightness, gel enhanced LED light source.  In the illustrative embodiment, the light source 58 includes multiple heat sinks (substrate 136 and mounting block 144) with substrate 136 in intimate contact with LED chip 138, and mounting block 144 in thermal communication with LED chip 138 through translucent gel 140.  In addition, the LED chip 138 is in intimate contact with the translucent gel 140 placed between the LED chip 138 and the first set of optics 60.  By way of example, the light source 58 must produce at least about 4 Lumens of light, with about 6 or more Lumens being preferred, and with about 10 or more Lumens with an FSTN LCD light valve.  In addition, the light source 58 should have a density of light of at least 18 Lumens per square mm of surface area of the LED chip 138.  <br>
One suitable light source 58 comprises an Xlamp, part number XL 7090-L100-RED, Bin #R2H, manufactured by Cree, Inc., Durham, SC.  However, it is to be understood that this manufacturer and part designation, as well as others to follow, are merely exemplary, and other equivalent components can be substituted.  With this light source 58, the LED chip 138 comprises an InGaAlP based LED die configured to produce red light and having dimensions of 1mm x 1mm x 0.16 mm.<br>
In addition to the above requirements, the light source 58 preferably has a light production efficiency of greater than about 24 Lumens per watt.  The above noted XL 7090-L100-RED, Bin #R2H light source 58 produces a light output having a Lambertion Spatial Pattern and an approximately 100 degree angle cone of light emission, and produces approximately 20.8 +/-2.7 Lumens of light while operating in a 25 °C environment, and drawing approximately 330 milliamps of electrical current.  In the illustrative embodiment, the light source 58 has been driven with as high as about 500 milli-Amps of electrical current. <br>
There are several options for driving the light source 58 (Figure 1B).  A first option is to use a resistor in series with the light source 58 (Figure 1B) to limit current to an acceptable level.  In this case the light source 58 (Figure 1B) will have a 100% duty cycle during the time the light source 58 (Figure 1B) is on.<br>
A second option is to pulse the light source 58 (Figure 1B) with a limited duty cycle.  In a pulsed mode, the human eye perceives the brightness being produced, as more than the average value being produced.  This can result in a perceived improvement in image quality, at a reduced power consumption and reduced heat generation, relative to operating at a constant current.  In this case, the light source 58 (Figure 1B) can be pulsed at a higher current for short periods of time in order to make the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) appear brighter to the user 14 (Figure 4A).  In addition, the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) appears to be brighter than with an arrangement where the light source 58 is operated at a current which is lower than the peak current of a pulse, but higher than the low point of a pulse for a continuous period.  As will be further explained, Figure 17 illustrates an exemplary pulsing circuit 108 for implementing the second option. <br>
A third option is to use a drive chip for the light source 58 (Figure 1B).  in addition, the mechanism for driving the light source 58 (Figure 1B) can comprise a user controlled adjustment for varying the brightness of the second visual image 46, and the power consumption of the light source 58.  Further, the mechanism for driving the light source 58, can contain a preset time from the manufacturer, or an adjustable time set by the user 14, which determines how long the light source 58 remains on when a call waiting signal is activated.  For example, an exemplary time period can be about 15 seconds. <br>
As shown in Figure 3A, the light source 58 (Figure 3A) is in signal communication with a control circuit 76 (Figure 3A) contained on an interface board 74 (Figure 3A).  In addition, the control circuit 76 (Figure 3A) is in signal communication with the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 3A).  As will be further explained, the control circuit 76 (Figure 3A) is configured to control elements of the image projection system 44 responsive to signals from the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 3A).<br>
The electro optic system 45 (Figure 1B) also includes a first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) configured to collect and process light from the light source 58 (Figure 1B)  in order to improve the brightness, contrast or image quality of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B).  In addition, the first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) can be configured to process light from the light source 58 (Figure 1B) to improve the degree of collimation of the light, and can be configured to manipulate the light in size, shape or form factor.  The first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) can comprise a single optic element or multiple optic elements, and can include elements integrated into the light source 58 (Figure 1B).  The optic elements of the first set of optics 60 can comprise refractive optic elements, reflective optic elements, diffractive optic elements, light piping elements, or combinations thereof.  An exemplary spacing between the light source 58 (Figure 1B) and the first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) can be about 8 mm.  The light source 58 (Figure 1B) can also be processed through light piping, light channeling, refractive, reflective, or diffractive elements.  In some cases, these elements can provide superior results relative to a light source at a distance having a physically blocking frame.   <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) comprises a refractive optic element in the form of a Fresnel lens contained on a frame 61 (Figure 2B) mounted to the base 56.  One suitable Fresnel lens is available from Edmund Optics Inc. of Barrington, NJ, as part number Y43-022, having a 0.5 inch lens diameter, a 0.4 inch focal length, a 0.06 inch overall lens thickness, and a Fresnel pattern formed by 250 grooves per inch.  The lens is a molded acrylic lens having an index of refraction of 1.49.  This lens is placed with its smooth face side facing the light source 58, and the contoured, infinite conjugate side facing the light valve 64. <br>
 The electro optic system 45 (Figure 1B) also includes a light valve 64 (Figure 1B), such as an LCD (liquid crystal display) or other display with transparent or translucent pixels.  The light valve 64 (Figure 1B) is configured to receive light from the light source 58 (Figure 1B) and the first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B), and to generate a pattern 46” (Figure 3F) enabling the formation of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) responsive to electronic signals.  In the illustrative embodiment the pattern 46” varies as a function of the electronic signals.  However, the light  valve 64 (Figure 1B) can also be configured to generate a fixed pattern or a pattern having both variable and fixed elements.  As shown in Figure 3A, the light valve 64 (Figure 3A) is in signal communication with the control circuit 76 (Figure 3A) contained on the interface board 74 (Figure 3A). In addition, a representative spacing between the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) and the first set of optics 60 (Figure 1B) can be about 5.5 mm.  When the light exiting the first set of optics 60 has a high degree of collimation, the spacing distance between the light valve 64 and the first set of optics 60 can vary significantly without producing a significant effect on the second visual image 46.  In addition, assembly misalignments can be more easily overcome with highly collimated light. <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) comprises a chip on glass (COG) negative image, film compensated supertwisted nematic (FSTN) liquid crystal display (LCD) configured for generation of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) as alpha numeric characters with a desired size, spacing and shape.  Alternately rather than alpha numeric characters, the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) can be configured to generate the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) as pictures, characters, drawings, symbols, photographs, or video information.  Further, the second visual image 46 can be representative of any type of data including but not limited to music, stocks, sports, weather, traffic, news and head line data.  In addition, the data can be presented in viewable segments that are scrolled into position using a button on the keypad 32 (Figure 1A), or automatic streaming in the manner of a ticker tape machine.<br>
Referring to Figures 6A-6C, the light valve 64 is shown separately.  In the illustrative embodiment, the light valve 64 comprises a chip on glass liquid crystal display (LCD).  The light valve 64 includes a transparent substrate 120 (Figure 6A) having terminal leads 122 (Figure 6A) in electrical communication with traces (not shown) on the substrate 120 (Figure 6A).  The terminal leads 122 (Figure 6A) electrically connect the light valve 64 to the control circuit 76 (Figure 8) for the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B).  The light valve 64 also includes a driver chip 124 (Figure 6A) in electrical communication with the terminal leads 122 (Figure 6A).  One suitable driver chip 124 (Figure 6A) comprises a Novatek NT7605 chip configured to include suitable drive circuitry.  Alternately in place of the driver chip 124 (Figure 6A), the drive circuitry could include circuits fabricated from amorphous silicon or polysilicon thin film transistors, or single crystal transistors integrated into the substrate 120 (Figure 6A).   <br>
The light valve 64 also includes an active area 126 (Figure 6A) comprising an array of character blocks 128 (Figure 6A).  The active area 126 can have a selected width and length (e.g., 2.07 millimeter x 6.87 millimeter). In addition, polarizers 132, 134 (Figure 6B) are located on opposing sides of the active area 126. <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the active area 126 (Figure 6A) comprises two rows of twelve character blocks 128 (Figure 6A), with each block made up of an array of 5 X 7 rectangular pixel dots 130 (Figure 6C).  With this arrangement, the active area 126 has about 840 pixels.  In order to represent a phone number twelve digits are required, including a space or dash between area code, prefix and number, and the actual ten numbers.  In the illustrative embodiment, the character blocks 128 comprise pixel dots, or pixel segments, that are used to generate either numbers or letters.  The number or letter capability is required because the top row of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) with a left hand orientation (Figures 5A-5C) of the phone 10 will become the bottom row with a right hand orientation (Figure 4A-4C).  Even if a lesser esthetic option of a sixteen segment character block were used, the two row, twelve character display would consist of at least 384 pixels.  Small light valves, such as the one used in the illustrative embodiment, with this number of addressable pixels require circuits integrated into the light valve substrate via direct patterning or chip on glass (COG) technology.<br>
One suitable light valve 64 is an LCD, part number C10695 Rev 1, which was custom manufactured by Pacific Display Devices of Diamond Bar, CA for the phone 10.  The custom LCD comprises a negative image COG FSTN LCD with a 2.07 millimeter x 6.87 millimeter active area and an overall substrate 120 (Figure 6A) size of 13 mm x 15 mm.  The rectangular pixels within the active area of the C10695 LCD are 0.09 mm wide and 0.13 mm high, having a spacing between pixels within a character block of 0.01 mm.  The character blocks within the active area of the C10695 LCD have a vertical spacing between character blocks of 0.15 mm, and a horizontal spacing between character blocks within a row of 0.09 mm. <br>
As shown in Figure 2C, an alternate embodiment emissive electro optic system 44A includes an addressable emissive display 64A, such as an addressable patterned LED display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED), an electroluminescent display, a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a field emission display (FED) or other display having light producing pixels.  In this case, the light source 58 (Figure 2B) and the first set of optics 60 (Figure 2B) can be eliminated.<br>
As another alternative, the addressable emissive display 64A can be replaced by a reflective display such as a reflective liquid crystal display, a digital mirror display (DMD), a reflective LCOS display, a reflective electrochromic display or other display with reflective pixels, such that the amount or direction of the  pixels reflection is variable.  In an embodiment employing a reflective display, the light source 58 (Figure 2A) and the first set of optics 60 (Figure 2A) would be positioned such that light would be imparted onto the same side of the reflective display as the exiting light.<br>
The image projection system 44 (Figure 2A) also includes an optics system in the form of a second set of optics 66 (Figure 2A) configured to receive the pattern 46” (Figure 3F) which has been formed by the light valve 64 (Figure 2A), to process the pattern 46” (Figure 3F) into the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B), and to project the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) toward the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3B).  The mirror image 46’ is then reflected from the viewing surface 48 to the user 14 (Figure 4B) as the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B).  <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the second set of optics 66 (Figure 2B) is contained in a stepped tube 68 (Figure 2B) having a mounting flange 70 (Figure 2B) that attaches to the light valve 64 (Figure 2B), and a mounting flange 72 (Figure 2B) that attaches to the base 56 (Figure 2B).  In addition, the bottom end surface 20 (Figure 2B) of the handset 12 (Figure 2B) includes an opening 114 (Figure 2B) for the second optics system 66 (Figure 2B).  Further, as shown in Figure 2B, the second set of optics 66 can be recessed in the handset 12, such that the opening 114 in the bottom end surface 20 has a rim 69 which protects the second set of optics 66.  The second set of optics 66 is thus less likely to be scratched or damaged by movement of the handset 12 during use and storage. <br>
The second set of optics 66 (Figure 2A) can include a single optical element, such as a positive convex lens, or multiple optical elements configured to project the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) toward the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3B).  The optical elements for the second set of optics 66 can comprise refractive optical elements, reflective optical elements, diffractive optical elements, light piping elements or combinations thereof.  In addition, the second set of optics 66 (Figure 2A) can include a focusing mechanism (not shown) configured for manually focusing the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) such that it is in readable focus for at least one of the user’s eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4B), when the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3A) is at a distance D (Figure 3A) from the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3A).  This allows the user 14 to set an offset which accommodates their particular vision and tastes.  Furthermore, the second set of optics 66 can include a lens with an electrically tunable focus length such as a PAM-1000 tunable lens produced by Varioptic of Lyon, France. <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3A) comprises a positive optical lens.  One suitable lens for constructing the second set of optics 66 is an achromatic lens available from Edmund Industrial Optics, of Barrington, NJ, as part number Y45-092, having a diameter of 9 mm, an effective focal length of 27 mm and a back focal length of 24.22 mm.  This lens is configured and positioned in the image projection system 44 to project along an optical axis 52 (Figure 3A) at a distance D (Figure 3A) to the viewing surface of about 8-16 inches.  <br>
A representative height H1 (Figure 3B) of the individual characters on the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) can be 3.5 mm to 21.5 mm, with 9 mm being typical.  A representative width W (Figure 3B) of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) can be from 25 mm to 152 mm depending on the distance D, the size of the active area 126 (Figure 6A), and the configuration of the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3A), with 64 mm being typical.  A representative height H2 of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) can be from 7.6 mm to 46.2 mm, with 19.3 mm being typical.  A representative width to height ratio can be greater than 1.5:1, with the illustrative embodiment being 3.3:1.  <br>
Figure 3C illustrates an alternate embodiment second visual image 46A which is formed along curved lines.  This arrangement compresses the second visual image 46A so that a width W2 of the second visual image 46A is less than the width W of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B).  <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) reads from left to right.  In addition, the portable phone 10 can include the orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 3E) configured to sense the orientation of the portable phone 10 as “left hand” or “right hand” relative to the user 14 (Figure 4A), and to orient the second visual image 46 with a left to right reading format, regardless of whether the left hand orientation or the right hand orientation of the portable phone 10 is used.  For example, the portable phone 10 can be held in the left hand 82 (left hand orientation) as shown in Figures 4A-4C, or in the right hand 84 (left hand orientation) as shown in Figures 5A-5C.  In either case, the orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 3E) orients the second visual image 46 for left to right viewing by the user 14.  Stated differently, the orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 3E) is configured to rotate the second visual image 46 in the left hand orientation (Figures 4A-4C) 180° relative to the second visual image 46 in the right hand orientation (Figure 5A-5C).<br>
As shown in Figure 1B, the orientation sensing device 106 is contained on a circuit board 112 mounted within the handset 12 (Figure 1B).  In addition, the orientation sensing device 106 is in electrical communication with a microcontroller U2 (Figure 8) of the control circuit 76 (Figure 8) for the image projection system 44.  As shown in Figure 3E, the orientation sensing device 106 includes output pins P1 and P2.  The output from output pins P1 and P2 changes as a function of the orientation of the sensing device 106. In Figure 3E the orientation sensing device 106 is shown in five different positions relative to a longitudinal axis 54 of the handset 12, and the corresponding output from output pins P1 and P2 is illustrated.   <br>
As illustrated in Figure 3E, the output of pins PT1/PT2 will be high or low depending on the orientation of the orientation sensing device 106.  Based on input from the pins PT1/PT2, the microcontroller U2 (Figure 8) of the control circuit 76 (Figure 8) controls the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) to orient the mirror image 46’ of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3D) in position A (Figure 3D) or position B (Figure 3D).  One suitable orientation sensing device 106 is available from Sharp Electronics of the Americas of Camas, WA, and is designated a photointerrupter for detecting  tilt direction, part number GP1S36.  Alternately, a manual switch, a voice command switch, a soft key, or a keyed in sequence can be used to change the orientation of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B).<br>
Referring to Figure 3F, the operation of the image projection system 44 is illustrated.  The image projection system 44 includes the electro optic system 45 which comprises the light source 58, the first set of optics 60 and the light valve 64 configured to generate the pattern 46” responsive to control signals from the control circuit 76 (Figure 8).  In addition, the image projection system 44 includes the second set of optics 66 configured to process the pattern 46” into the mirror image 46’ of the second visual image 46 and to project the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) onto the viewing surface 48. <br>
In Figure 3F, there are break lines 146 between the second set of optics 66 and the second visual image 46 on the viewing surface 48.  The break lines 146 are required to show relative proportions without having to show the actual length of distance D, which is the distance between the second set of optics 66 and the viewing surface 48.  In addition, the second visual image 46 is depicted as it would appear in an edge view, and is illustrated as an arrow because it’s size can change depending on the distance D.  The pattern 46” generated by the light valve 64 is also depicted as an arrow.  The arrows provide an orientation comparison of the pattern 46” generated by the light valve 64 relative to the second visual image 46.  In addition, the arrows show that the size of the second visual image 46 is larger than the pattern 46” produced by the light valve 64.  In accordance with the invention, the handset 12 and the viewing surface 48 can be manipulated by the user 14 (Figure 4A) to vary the distance D to provide ergonomic and readable viewing of the second visual image 46. <br>
As shown in Figure 3F, the light source 58 generates an emission cone of light rays 148 having a relatively large angle. In Figure 3F, the light rays 148 emitted by the light source are shown as solid lines with arrow heads at their point of entry with the light valve 64.  The dashed optical tracing lines 152 (Figure 3F) and 154 (Figure 3F), are shown converging from the ends of pattern 46” toward the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F), where the lines cross, and are then shown as diverging from the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) toward the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3F)<br>
Some of the light rays 148 from the light source 58 disperse as indicated, the light rays 148, which are collected, collimated and directed by the first set of optics 60 towards the active area 126 of the light valve 64, are used to produce the pattern 46”.  The light rays 148 which will become collimated, narrow angle light rays after passing through the first set of optics 60, will pass through the light valve 64 more effectively than wide angle light from the light source 58, resulting in the second visual image 46 having improved brightness, contrast or image quality, particularly when the light valve 64 comprises an LCD.  Furthermore, collimating the light rays 148 and reducing the spread of light, wastes less light.  This is because more light will fall on the active area 126 of the light valve 64 (Figure 3F), and less light will fall outside the active area 126.  The more nearly the cross section of the beam of collimated light rays 148 traveling from the first set of optics 66 to the light valve 64, matches the size and shape of the active area 126, the brighter the second visual image 46 will be.  <br>
As previously explained, the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3F) of the second visual image 46 may be reflected to the eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4A) of the user 14 from the viewing surface 48 which can be a body part (e.g., hands 82, 84), or other convenient or ergonomically beneficial surface.  This arrangement, although effective, has trade offs in optical performance, because of the relatively low reflectivity, and surface contours of body parts, which are not flat, smooth and planar.  Because of the optical performance trade offs resulting from the viewing surface 48 being less than ideal, the first set of optics 60 serves a critical function in increasing the brightness of the second visual image 46.  The control circuit 76 (Figure 8) can also include circuit elements and external controls on the handset 12 configured to increase or decrease the brightness of the light source 58 and the second visual image 46.  The control circuit 76 (Figure 8) can also include circuit elements and external sensors configured to sense ambient brightness, and then increase or decrease the brightness of the light source 58 and the second visual image 46 as a function of the ambient brightness.   <br>
In the case where the active area 126 (Figure 3F) of the light valve 64 (Figure 3F) has a width greater than its height, the first set of optics 60 (Figure 3F) may be configured to process the light rays 148 (Figure 3F) from the light source 58 (Figure 3F) asymmetrically, expanding the beam in one dimension more than another, or alternatively shrinking it in one dimension more than another.  Any number of approaches using refractive, diffractive, reflective and light piping optical elements may be employed.  One such approach would be to employ refractive optic elements or refractive optic surfaces in the first set of optics 60, which have different focal lengths along the width axis and height axis of the light valve 64.  Another such approach would be to employ a round-to-rectangle tapered fiber optic bundle in the first set of optics 60.  Exemplary round-to-rectangle tapered fiber optic bundles are available through Schott North America Inc., of Southbridge, MA, and are referred to as fused fiber optic tapers.  Further examples are available from Fiber Optics Technology Inc., of Pomfret, CT.<br>
The light valve 64 (Figure 3F) using control signals from the control circuit 76 (Figure 8) transforms the light rays 148 into the pattern 46” (Figure 3F), which after being processed by the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) becomes the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) of the second visual image 46.  The mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) is projected by the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) onto the viewing surface 48, and is reflected off the viewing surface 48 to become the second visual image 46.  As previously stated, the distance D between the viewing surface 48 and the second set of optics 66 can be selected to provide an ergonomically viewable second image 46 for the user 14.  <br>
Shortening the distance between the light valve 64 (Figure 3F) and the last element of the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) can be used to provide more available space inside the handset 12 for other components and systems of the portable phone 10.  This can be particularly beneficial in cellular phones, which are typically the smallest portable phones.  The optical elements of the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) can be configured to achieve a shorter distance between the light valve 64 (Figure 3F) and the final optic element of the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F), relative to that of a single positive lens.  In addition, the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3F) can be configured to maintain a same size for the second visual image 46 at substantially the same distance D.  Although such an approach may add cost and complexity to the second set of optics 66, overall benefits in space savings may be achieved.  <br>
One such approach is to project a converging image away from the second set of optics 66, as opposed to the diverging image shown in 3F.  The converging image reaches a crossing point between the second set of optics 66 and the viewing surface 48 where the image inverts and begins expanding.  Another approach for reducing the distance from the light valve 64 to the second set of optics 66 is to employ a single refractive positive lens with a shorter focal length, and a light valve 64 with a smaller active area.  When the pattern 46” formed by the light valve 64 is wider than its height, and a single positive lens is used for the second set of optics 66, a rectangular or elliptical shaped outer perimeter of the lens can be utilized, resulting in a reduction in size, relative to a lens having a fixed diameter, and without substantially compromising the quality of the second visual image 46.<br>
Referring to Figures 4A-4C, the portable phone 10 is illustrated in use by the user 14 during a phone conversation with a left hand orientation.  In Figures 4A-4C, the orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 4A) senses the left hand orientation of the handset 12, and orients the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) of the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) projecting from the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3D) with the orientation A (Figure 3D).  In this case, the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) projects from the second set of optics 66 (Figure 3D) oriented approximately 90° to the surfaces 16, 18 (Figure 3D), and with the alpha numeric characters reading in a direction extending from the back surface 18 (Figure 3D) towards the front surface 16 (Figure 3D) of the handset 12 (Figure 3D).<br>
Also in Figures 4A-4C, the user 14 holds the handset 12 in the left hand 82 with the speaker 26 held against or proximate to the left ear 92.  In addition, the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) is projected onto the viewing surface 48 (Figure 4C) which comprises the open palm 86 (Figure 4C) of the right hand 84 (Figure 4C).  The mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) is projected orthogonally relative to the front surface 16 (Figure 3D) of the handset 12, along a vector 156 (Figures 4A and 4B) which extends in a direction from the speaker 26 (Figure 1A) towards the microphone 28 (Figure 1A) of the handset 12.  Stated differently, the vector 156 has a direction traveling away from the bottom of the handset 12.  The direction of the vector 156 is controlled by the user 14 moving the handset 12 about the head 80 and the ear 94.  At the same time, the user 14 can move the viewing surface 48 such that the projection of the mirror image 46” (Figure 3D) intersects the viewing surface 48.  The unique configuration of the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B) in the handset 12 allows great flexibility in controlling the location, size and focus of the second visual image 46.  This is because the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B), being fixedly attached to the handset 12, has a fixed orientation in the handset 12, which eliminates the need for additional mechanical devices to control the direction of the vector 156.  The image projection system 44 is in effect part of the handset 12, and is controlled by movement of the handset 12. <br>
The user 14 can control the location, the size and the focus of the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) by manipulating the handset 12 (Figure 4B), such as by rotating the handset 12 (Figure 4B) about the left ear 92 (Figure 4B), and by slanting a longitudinal axis 54 (Figure 4B) of the handset 12 (Figure 4B) relative to the head 80 (Figure 4B).  The handset 12 (Figure 4B) can also be moved by small amounts in the X, Y and Z directions, and rotated slightly about the longitudinal axis 54 (Figure 4B) as well.  In addition, the right hand 84 (Figure 4C) of the user 14 can be moved in X, Y and Z directions and rotated as well, such that the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) is located and focused at a position in front of the eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4B), and at a distance D (Figure 4A) from the second optics system 66 (Figure 4A) that permits clear viewing of the second visual image 46 (Figure 4A). The handset 12, and the configuration of the image projection system 44 in the handset 12, provide a mechanism for pointing and projecting the mirror image 46” (Figure 3D) at the viewing surface 48.    <br>
By way of example, an optical axis 52 (Figure 4B) of the image projection system 44 (Figure 3A) can be constructed with an angle X (Figure 4B) of from 0° to 45° relative to a longitudinal axis 54 (Figure 4B) of the handset 12 (Figure 4B), with approximately 0° being preferred.  In addition, the image projection system 44 (Figure 3A) can be constructed, such that an angle Y (Figure 4A) of the second visual image 46 can be from 5° to 75°, with 11° to 28°, being preferred. <br>
Alternately, the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) can be projected onto another body part, such as the wrist 88 (Figure 4C) or the forearm 90 (Figure 4C).  Rather than a body part, the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) can be projected upon another surface, such as clothing, or furniture, such as the back of an airplane seat, or a hinged dining table attached to the seat.  In this regard, the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3A) can comprise any surface in close proximity to the user’s eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4B) and the handset 12 (Figure 4B), while the portable phone 10 is in use during a phone conversation.  In addition, the viewing surface 48 (Figure 3A) is preferably in a direct line of sight with the user’s eyes 102, 104 (Figure 4B) while the speaker 26 (Figure 1A) is proximate to the user’s ear 92 (Figure 4B).<br>
Further, the handset 12 (Figure 4B) and the image protection system 44 (Figure 3A) can be used while the user 14 (Figure 4B) is sitting, standing, laying down or moving.  In addition to providing ergonomic viewing by the user 14 (Figure 4B) during a phone conversation, the viewing surface 48 (Figure 4C) can be located such that that background light and glare can be reduced or substantially eliminated.  Also, the handset 12 (Figure 4B) is under hand control, and can be quickly moved and manipulated by the user 14 (Figure 4B) to make the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) focused and readable.  The handset 12 (Figure 4B) becomes another appendage of the user 14 due to the placement and function of the image projection system 44 (Figure 3A) within the handset 12. <br>
Still further, the viewing surface 48 (Figure 4C) can be located such that the user 14 (Figure 4B) can easily view the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C), while other persons cannot see the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C).  This provides some measure of privacy, particularly over systems such as voice boxes.  In addition, privacy can be achieved because the user 14 (Figure 4B) can control the viewing surface 48 (Figure 4C), and the focus of the second visual image 46 (Figure 4C) as well.  Accordingly, if the user 14 (Figure 4B) wishes another person to view the visual image 46 (Figure 46), the viewing surface 48 can be moved or another viewing surface 48 can be selected, such that the data can be shared, but without interruption of a phone conversation.  <br>
Referring to Figures 5A-5C, the portable phone 10 is illustrated in use by the user 14 during a phone conversation with a right hand orientation.  With the right hand orientation, the user 14 holds the handset 12 (Figure 5B) in the right hand 84 (Figure 5B) with the speaker 26 (Figure 1A) held against or proximate to the right ear 94 (Figure 5B).  In addition, the user 14 moves the left hand 82 (Figure 5B) to locate and focus the image 46 (Figure 5C) in the direction of vector 156, substantially as previously described.  As with the left hand orientation (Figures 4A-4C), the second visual image 46 reads from left to right.  This requires that the orientation sensing device 106 (Figure 5A) rotate the mirror image 46’ (Figure 3D) by 180° from orientation A (Figure 3D) to orientation B (Figure 3D).  In addition, the mirror image 46’ of the second visual image 46 (Figure 3D) projects from the second optics system 66 (Figure 3D) oriented approximately 90° to the surfaces 16, 18 (Figure 3D), and with a row of alpha numeric characters reading in a direction extending from the front surface 16 (Figure 3D) towards the back surface 18 (Figure 3D) of the handset 12 (Figure 3D).<br>
Referring to Figure 7A, a block diagram illustrates the interface of the control circuit 76 with the conventional phone circuitry 38.  In the illustrative embodiment, the conventional phone circuitry 38 included a direct view LCD and a microcontroller configured to generate visual data for the phone direct view display 34 (Figure 1A).  <br>
The control circuit 76 is contained on the interface board 74 which is mounted within the portable phone 10.  In addition, as will be further explained, the control circuit 76 includes a programmable microcontroller U2 (Figure 8). The control circuit 76 is in electrical communication with the conventional phone circuitry 38, and converts the same signals used to generate the visual data for the direct view display 34 (Figure 1A) to a format suitable for driving the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) of the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B).     <br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the control circuit 76 is required because the signals from the conventional phone circuitry 38 cannot directly drive the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) of the image projection system 44 (Figure 3A). In the illustrative embodiment, the conventional phone circuitry 38 of the previously identified Uniden cordless phone uses a four wire serial configuration, which was converted by the control circuit 76 to a four bit parallel interface suitable for driving the light valve 64 (Figure 1B).  However, the control circuit 76 can be constructed to convert signals from any conventional phone circuitry including 2, 3 or 4 wire serial configurations.<br>
Referring to Figure 7B, a block diagram illustrates an alternate interface in which signals from the conventional phone circuitry 38 are used to directly drive the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) of the image projection system 44 (Figure 1B).  In this case, the direct view display 34 (Figure 1A) and the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) use the same interface.  As another alternative, if the direct view display 34 (Figure 1A) uses a different interface than the light valve 64 (Figure 1B), then the programmable microcontroller U2 can be programmed to convert the signals required to drive the light valve 64 (Figure 1B).<br>
Referring to Figure 8, the interface board 74 and the control circuit 76 are illustrated.  The control circuit 76 performs several functions during operation of the image projection system 44.  A first function of the control circuit 76 is to initialize the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) and load a correct register setting at startup.  In this regard, the driver chip 124 (Figure 6A) of the light valve 64 (Figure 6A) has different options for displaying the second image 46 (Figure 3B) and the control circuit 76 is used to select and load these options at start up. <br>
A second function of the control circuit 76 is to take serial data from the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B) and convert this data to a serial format required by the light valve 64 (Figure 1B).  <br>
A third function of the control circuit 76 is to control the activation of the light source 58 (Figure 1B). If desired, the light source 58 (Figure 1B) can be activated after a set time period (e.g., several seconds or more) following the initial reception of the caller waiting ID signals.<br>
The control circuit 76 includes a field programmable gate array (FPGA) microcontroller U2 and supporting components.  EPROM U1 comprises a reprogrammable configuration PROM for the microcontroller U2.  Software is loaded into the EPROM U1 and is loaded into the microcontroller U2 during start up.  Oscillator X1 is an oscillator which provides a continuous clock signal and a system clock for the microcontroller U2.  A clock signal from the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B) could alternately be used, but the oscillator X1 provides a known clock signal.<br>
The control circuit 76 also include a 2.5 volt linear regulator U4 which provides power to the microcontroller U2. In the illustrative embodiment component U3 is not used.  There are also six pins on the interface board 74 which are connected to the EPROM U1.  These pins allow new software to be downloaded through a cable (not shown) connected to a computer (not shown) which allows for updates to the software.  The interface board 74 also includes input pads in electrical communication with the phone circuitry 38 (Figure 1B).  The interface board 74 also includes output pads in electrical communication with the light valve 64 (Figure 1B) and the light source 58 (Figure 1B).  <br>
The following Table I identifies the components on the interface board 74.  In addition, dotted circuit traces in Figure 8 illustrate the interconnection of the components on the interface board 74.  In Table I the supplier “Digi-Key” is the Digi-Key Corporation, of Thief River Falls, MN. <br><br>

 	In Figure 9, the microcontroller U2 is illustrated separately. In the illustrative embodiment, the microcontroller U2 comprises a Xilinx Spartan II manufactured by Xilinx Corporation of San Jose, CA.

Referring to Figure 17, a pulsing circuit 108 for pulsing the light source 58 is illustrated.  The pulsing circuit 108 is configured to pulse a driving current to the light source 58 such that a high current is followed by a low current or no current.  This pulses the second visual image 46 (Figure 3B) from a first intensity (i.e., bright) to a second intensity (i.e., dim).  This reduces power consumption and heat generation relative to a constant current.  The pulsing circuit 108 includes a transistor Q1 configured to cycle current to the light source 58 responsive to control signals.  In the illustrative embodiment, transistor Q1 comprises an N-channel MOSFET for LED control, available from Digi-Key as part number IRLL-2705CT-ND. <br>
