				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a cutter plate which is particularly suitable for finishing<br>
cutters, in particular crankshaft finishing cutters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is necessary in the course of processing crankshafts to perform further<br>
processing steps for example finish-milling steps, on a crankshaft blank or on a<br>
crankshaft which was pre-processed by means of rough milling. In the course of<br>
this processing it can become necessary, for example, to work the cylinder faces<br>
of cylindrical pins and simultaneously the flat surfaces adjoining the pin. Fcr<br>
example, this relates to the crank pin, as well as the surfaces adjoining the crank<br>
pin, the so-called oil collars. A so-called relief groove is often provided between<br>
the first surfaces and the cylinder face of the pin, which is also intended to be<br>
produced by, means of a milling process.<br>
As a rule, further processing steps follow the milling process, which can be<br>
include, for example grinding operations on the cylindrical pins and roller-<br>
burnishing processes on the relief groove. It is attempted here to perform the<br><br>
milling operation with such a quality that the subsequent processing operations<br>
can be reduced to a necessary minimum.<br>
A disk milling cutter and a reversible plate suitable for this are provided by DE<br>
197 39 366 Al, wherein the reversible plates are maintained in a radial direction<br>
against the tool body as so-called radial plates. The radial cutter plates are<br>
rectangular plates which have protrusions on two radially oppositely located<br>
corners, which are used for forming the relief groove at the crankshaft.<br>
With this milling tool the same number of active cutters results for forming the<br>
relief grooves as for the other surfaces to be worked. However, an increased<br>
chip removal volume results in the area of the relief grooves, compared with the<br>
area of the cylinders face, for example. Moreover, the number of active cutter<br>
edges in the area of the circumferential surface is increased when it is intended<br>
to process particularly slim crank pins, so that succeeding reversing cutter plates<br>
overlap each other to a greater extent.<br>
As a result the lengths of the cutting areas are then larger in the area of the<br>
relief groove than in the area of the crank pin, which can result in an increased<br>
outlay for finishing work at the relief groove.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object on which the invention is based is derived from this, namely to create<br>
a cutter plate for a milling tool, as well as a suitable milling tool, which makes it<br>
possible to mill the oil collar, the relief groove and the crank pin of a crankshaft<br>
with the same tool in one operation, after which a finish-milling process, for<br>
example, finishing-grinding, of only the crank pin should be required.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The cutter plates are so-called tangential plates, i.e. they are designed for being<br>
mounted in plate seats the normal surface line of the bearing surface of which<br>
approximately points in the radial direction or the axial direction. In this case a<br>
surface of the plate seat is considered to be the bearing surface, against which<br>
the cutter plate is braced by means of a fastening device, for example a<br>
clamping screw. The tangential plate concept makes possible an increase in the<br>
number of teeth in the area of the relief grooves, even in connection with very<br>
slim crank pins, provided the cutter plates in accordance with the invention are<br>
employed. These have at least one protrusion on their cover surface for forming<br>
the relief groove, and at least one other protrusion on a lateral surface. It is<br>
possible in this way to assign a cutter plate seated on a bearing surface with an<br><br>
axial normal surface line to each cutter plate seated on a bearing surface with a<br>
radial normal surface line. This arrangement results in two cutting edges for the<br>
relief groove and one cutting edger for the cylinder face. The cutting edge for<br>
the cylinder face is constituted by a straight main cutting edge section. This<br>
arrangement results in particularly short cutting arc lengths in the relief groove.<br>
Remaining processing traces can be removed in a simple roller-burnishing<br>
process. If the processing accuracy following the finishing-milling process is<br>
sufficient, the roller-burnishing process can be omitted.<br>
More over, the result of roller-burnishing substantially depends on the quantity of<br>
pre-processing. A very smooth surface (short lengths of the cutting arc) is<br>
already achieved prior to roller-burnishing by means of the finishing cutter of the<br>
invention and the cutter plate of the invention, so that again a very good roller-<br>
burnishing result can be achieved. Extension tensions occur in the area of the<br>
relief groove during the subsequent operation of the crankshaft. Here the surface<br>
quality in the relief groove determines the tendency for the formation of cracks,<br>
and therefore the load-bearing ability of the crankshaft.<br>
The first protrusion formed on the cutter plate can extend over the entire length<br>
of the cover surface of the cutter plate and can therefore extend from the lateral<br>
surface, which leads during use, to the lateral surface, which trails during use. In<br>
this case the protrusion is embodied as a rib oriented in the direction of<br>
movement. This constitutes a solution which can be easily produced and is<br>
rugged. However, if needed, this protrusion can also be interrupted in its center,<br>
so that it is for example divided into two protrusions arranged on the cover<br>
surface. The same applies correspondingly to the second protrusion arranged on<br><br>
a lateral surface of the cutter plate. In a view of the lateral surface which leads<br>
during its employment, or the lateral surface which trails during employment<br>
which, for example, can be designed to be approximately trapezoidal, it can be<br>
seen that the protrusions are arranged on corners which are located diagonally<br>
across from each other, but on surface of the cutter plate which have a common<br>
edge, i.e. which adjoin each other. The installed positions of the cutter plate,<br>
wherein the first protrusion and wherein the second protrusion are active, differ<br>
correspondingly by a turn of approximately 90°. This corresponds to the different<br>
radial, or axial, orientation of eth plate seats.<br>
The protrusions have matching contours, i.e. matching cutting edges. This is in<br>
the sense that the main cutting edge of the first protrusion can be brought to<br>
overlap the main cutting edge of the second protrusion, once the cutter plates<br>
have been properly positioned. Because of this, both protrusions can be<br>
employed for forming the exact same relief groove and can remove chips of<br>
approximately the same thickness.<br>
For example, the protrusions can be embodied as ribs which are arranged<br>
substantially parallel in respect to each other, thus in both installed positioned<br>
each of the ribs points in the circumferential direction of the milling tool.<br>
The cutter plate preferably has a cover surface which is divided into two surface<br>
areas, between which there is a recess. The surface areas can be narrow strip-<br>
shaped areas, for example, which are located on a common plane and each of<br>
which is adjoined by main cutting edges. The same as the lateral surfaces and<br>
the base surface of the cutter plate, these surface areas are preferably ground in<br><br>
order to obtain a precise work result at the crankshaft. While the other surface<br>
are embodied to be flat or convex, the cover surface has a concavely arched<br>
section. The latter is located at the base of the protrusion. The division of the<br>
cover surface into narrow, for example strip-shaped surfaces areas, between<br>
which the cover surface is located slightly lower, allows the grinding treatment of<br>
the cover surface with a grinding tool having only one grinding edge, in that the<br>
volume of material to be removed during the grinding process is minimized. The<br>
section between the two surface areas can remain rough. In this case the two<br>
ground cover surface areas constitute a precisely worked surface, which can be<br>
used as a bearing surface when the second protrusion is active (axially oriented<br>
plate seat in relation to the normal surface line of the bearing surface, also called<br>
'lateral plate seating*). The position of the main cutting edge is furthermore<br>
precisely fixed by the grinding process (radially oriented plate seat in relation to<br>
the normal surface line of the bearing surface, aiso called 'tangential plate<br>
seating').<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Two milling tools 1,2, which are identically designed, are illustrated in Fig. 1, and<br>
are designed as disk milling cutters and are used for the finish-milling processing<br>
of crank pins 3 of crankshafts, or other pins, for example bearing journals 4 of a<br>
crankshaft 5. In this case the milling tools 1, 2 are attached to appropriate<br>
machine spindles, not represented and are rotatingly driven, as indicated by the<br>
arrows 6,7. The crankshaft 5 is held in appropriate chunks 8, 9.<br>
The crankshaft 5 is again illustrated in Fig. 2. The contour to be produced is<br>
represented in heavy solid lines. Initially the crank pin 3 of the crankshaft, as<br>
well as the bearing journal 4, are oversized or have excessive size, i.e. there is<br>
material 11, 12 which must be removed, which is indicated by dash-dotted lines<br>
in Fig. 2. Following the removal thereof, the crank pin 3 of the crankshaft should<br>
have a cylinder surface face 14, which is adjoined on both sides by relief grooves<br>
15, 16. end faces 17, 18 (so-called oil collars) are then formed on both sides of<br>
the relief grooves. To form these surfaces in the course of a finish-milling<br>
process, the disk milling cutters 1,2 are equipped with uniform cutter plates 19,<br>
illustrated in Figs. 3 to 5. the cutter plates 19 are embodied as tangential plates.<br>
The cutter plates 19 have a base surface 21, a cover surface 22, preferably<br>
parallel in respect to the latter, as well as lateral surfaces 24, 25, 26, 27. a first<br>
protrusion 28 is formed on the lateral edge of the cover surface 22 adjoining the<br>
lateral surface 25. As can be seen in Fig. 4, it extends from the lateral surface 24<br><br>
as far as the lateral surface 26. It makes a level (without a concave curvature)<br>
transition into the lateral surface 25. A second protrusion 29 is provided on the<br>
lateral surface 27, which makes a level, i.e. without a concave curvature,<br>
transition into the lateral surface 27. The protrusions 27, 29 point in different<br>
directions A, b which are fixed by the direction of their feed movements. As<br>
represented in Fig. 3, the directions A, B can be fixed to extend vertically in<br>
respect to each other.<br>
With the lateral surface 24, the protrusion 29 encloses a main cutting edge 31,<br>
curved in an arc shape, whose shape corresponds to the contour of the grooves<br>
15, 16 to be produced. Emerging from the curvature of the main cutting edge<br>
31, the lateral surface 27 adjoining this curvature tangentially. In this way the<br>
inclination of the lateral surface 27 in relation to the base surface 21 is fixed at<br>
an angle which is determined by the tangent lines T1, 72 applied to the ends of<br>
the cutting edge 31. In the course of this a bevel, which is inclined at an obtuse<br>
angle in relation to the remaining base surface 21, can be provided in the base<br>
surface 21 adjoining the cutting edge 31, i.e. the tangent line Tl can be inclined<br>
at an acute angle in respect to the base surface 21.<br>
Together with the base surface 21, the lateral surface 24 borders a substantially<br>
straight edge 32 with, depending on the installed positioned of the cutter plate<br>
19, is inactive or is used as auxiliary cutting edge. In the case illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
the edge 32 forms an auxiliary cutting edge 32a adjoining the main cutting edge<br>
31, and is adjoined by a base surface edge 32b at an obtuse angle. Normally the<br>
base surface edge 32b is not used as a cutting edge.<br><br>
The protrusion 28 and the cover surface 22 adjoin the lateral surface 24 and<br>
define, together with the latter, a further main cutting edge 33, which has a<br>
straight section 34 and an arc - shaped section 32. The arc-shaped, or curved,<br>
section 35 has a convexly curved section 35a and a concavely curved section<br>
35b, by means of which it makes a transition into the straight section 34. The<br>
contour of the section 35a matches the main cutting edge 31. This can be seen<br>
in Fig. 6 in particular, which illustrates two cooperating cutter plates 19a, 19b.<br>
The main cutting edge 31 (dashed reference line) and the cutting edge section<br>
35a determine in a matching manner the concave contour of the relief groove<br>
16. In contrast thereto, the cutting edge section 35b of the cutting edge 19a by<br>
itself provides the transition from the relief groove 169 to the crank pin 3, and<br>
thus to the straight section 34 of the main cutting edge 33. In this way no<br>
concave curvature at all is required on the lateral surface s27 of the cutting edge<br>
19b, and it can therefore be produced by means of a simple surface grinding<br>
process. This is correspondingly true for the lateral surface 25.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, such as illustrated in Fig. 5, et cover surface<br>
21 of the cutter plate 19 is divided into surface areas 37, 38, which are located<br>
on a common plane.<br>
Each of the surface areas 37, 38 directly adjoins the neighbouring main cutting<br>
edge 33a, 33b, which represent the transition to the respective lateral surface<br>
24, 26. a surface area 39, which lies lower than the surface areas 37, 38, is<br>
arranged between the strip-shaped bearing surfaces 37, 38, which make a<br>
transition into the protrusion 28 by means of a concave curvature. While the<br><br>
surface areas 37, 38 are precision-ground, the surface area 39 can remain<br>
rough, i.e. can have the respective tolerances which occur in the course of<br>
sintering the cutter plate, which is preferably made of tungsten carbide or a hard<br>
metal (or ceramic material). However, a precise position of the main cutting<br>
edges 33a, 33b is achieved by means of the grinding processing of the surface<br>
areas 37, 38, as well as a precise positioning of the cutter plate 19 when the<br>
surface areas 37, 38 are used as bearing surfaces (second installed position).<br>
This design of the cutter plate has substantial advantages in respect to its<br>
production, as illustrated in Fig. 7. While the base surface 21 and the lateral<br>
surfaces 24 to 27 are end faces, which are merely adjoined by means of convex<br>
sections , such as the protrusion 29 or the respective edges, for example, these<br>
end faces and the convex surface areascan be produced by means of cost-<br>
efficient surface grinding processes, for example by means of a cup wheel 41.<br>
But this does not apply to the cover surfaces 22. There, a surface grinding<br>
process is impermissible because of the concave portion of the cover surface 22,<br>
which is adjoined by the cutting edge 35b. The level portion of the former can<br>
also not be worked by means of a surface grinding process, because then a<br>
shoulder toward the curved cutting edge 35 would result. However, because of<br>
the limitation of the cover surface 22 which must be ground off to only those<br>
areas which directly adjoin the cutting edge 33a, 33b, a very small volume of<br>
material to be removed results, so that a grinding tool 43 provided with a<br>
grinding edge 42 can be employed without the productivity of the manufacturing<br>
process being too greatly hindered. Thus, the interruption of the cover surface<br>
22 by the surface area 39 has considerable advantages in respect to the<br>
production of the cutter plate 19.<br><br>
The arrangement of four cutter plates in the milling tool 1 or 2 in accordance<br>
with Fig. 1 is schematically represented in a circumferential projection in Fig. 10.<br>
A first cutter plate 19-1 is mounted on a plate seat, whose bearing surface has a<br>
normal axial surface. In fig. 10 the axial direction is shown by an arrow A. In this<br>
case the cutter plate 19-1 is oriented in such a way that its protrusion 29-1 is<br>
maintained in an active cutting position. The auxiliary cutting edge 31-1 is also<br>
active.<br>
The associated cutter plate is a cutter is a plate 19-2, which is mounted on a<br>
tangentially oriented plate seat, whose bearing surface has a normal axial<br>
surface pointing in the radial direction R. The cutter plate 19-2 is seated and<br>
maintained in such a way that its protrusion 28-1 is aligned with the protrusion<br>
29-1 in the circumferential direction of the cutting tool 1 or 2. Thus the main<br>
cutting edge 33-2 adjoins the protrusion 28-2 smoothly.<br>
The left cutting edges of the disk milling cutter are designed in a corresponding<br>
laterally reversed configuration. The cutter plates 19-3 and 19-4 are provided for<br>
this. The main cutting edge 33-3 of the cutter plate 19-3 adjoins the cutting<br>
edge 33-2 of the cutter plate 19-2 in a directly overlapping manner. The<br>
protrusions 28-3 and 29-4 of the cutter plates 19-3, or 19-4 again overlap. In<br>
this configuration, two main cutting edges are provided for each relief groove 15,<br>
16 (see Fig. 2) namely the main cutting edges of the protrusions 28-2 and 29-1<br>
for the relief groove 16, and the main cutting edges of the protrusions 29-4, as<br>
well as 28-3 for relief groove 15. A complete cutting edge formed by the cutting<br>
edges 19-2 and 19-3 is provided for the cylinder surface of the crankcase pin 3,<br><br>
or a possible crankcase journal 4. In addition, respective cutting edges 32-4, or<br>
32-1 are provided as auxiliary cutting edges for both end faces 17,18.<br>
In the course of performing the milling work, the milling cutter 1 or 2 illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1 rotates in the direction of the arrow 6 or 7. The crankshaft 5 is<br>
simultaneously rotated, while the milling tools 1,2 can perform a corresponding<br>
oscillating compensating movement. With an increase in feeding, which is<br>
achieved by reducing the distance between the crank pin 3 and the milling tool 2<br>
(or 1), the protrusions 28, 29 of the cutter plates of the milling tool first remove<br>
the material areas 11, 12 illustrates in Fig. 2. Only when the straight sections of<br>
the main cutting edges 33 reach the excess material of the crank pin 3 of the<br>
bearing journal 4, they come into cutting contact with the crankshaft 5 and start<br>
to remove material. In this state the number of cutting edges of the protrusions<br>
28, 29 producing the relief grooves 15, 16 is twice as large as the number of<br>
cutting edges for producing the cylindrical areas of the crankshaft pin 3 or of the<br>
bearing journal 4. In this way a particularly short cutting arc length, and<br>
therefore a particularly great surface quality is achieved in the area of the relief<br>
grooves 15,16, which enhances the quality of the crankshaft.<br>
Fig. 11 shows another application option of the cutter plate 19 of the invention.<br>
The arrangement in accordance with Fig. 11 is based on the arrangement in<br>
accordance with Fig. 10, wherein an additional cutter plate 19-5 has been<br>
inserted between the cutter plates 19-2 and 19-3. Here, the base surface edge<br>
32b - 5 of the latter is used as the main cutting edge. By means of this<br>
configuration it is possible to produce crankshaft pins of any arbitrary width by<br>
means of the uniform cutter plate 19.<br><br>
Cutter plates 19 with an approximately cube-shaped base body have been<br>
created, in particular for finish - milling of a crankshaft 5. At the edge of its<br>
cover surface, the base body is provided with a hump or protrusion, which can<br>
be embodied rib - or strip-shaped, has a cutting edge on its front and back and<br>
adjoins the neighbouring lateral surface. This cutting edge is a component of the<br>
main cutting edge 33 adjoining the cover surface. A corresponding protrusion 29<br>
is provided on the lower end of the lateral surface 27 and adjoins the end of the<br>
cover surface 22 remote from the protrusion 28. In this case the lateral surface<br>
27 is preferably inclined in such a way that it terminates flush with the protrusion<br>
29 without forming a concave surface area with it. A corresponding milling tool<br>
can be completely and exclusively equipped with such cutter plates and can<br>
process in one work step the cylinder surface 14 of a crank pin, corresponding<br>
relief grooves 15,16 toward both edges of the cylinder surface 14, and adjoining<br>
end faces 17, 18. In the course of this a higher number of cutting edges is<br>
provided in the area of the relief grooves 15,16 than for the cylinder surface 14.<br>
Thus a particularly high degree of processing quality is achieved in the area of<br>
