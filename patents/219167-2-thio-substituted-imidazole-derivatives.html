Pharmacologically active imidazole compounds with anti-inflammatory activity are already known. Thus, inter alia, compounds having 4.5-di(hetero)arylimidazole moieties have been examined more closely, and various pharmaceutical actions thereof have been described. Also known are compounds which are substituted in the 2-position. US patent 4.585.771 discloses 4.5-dlphenylimidazole derivatives which are substituted in the 2-position by a pyrrolyl, indolyl. imidazoiyi or thiazolyl radical and which have anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity. US patents 4.528.298 and 4.402.960 describe 4.5-di(hetero)arylimidazole derivatives which are substituted in the 2-position via a thio, sulfinyl or sulfonyl group by a phenyl, pyhdyl, N-oxypyridyl, pyrimidyl, thiazolyl orthienyl radical and which have anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity. US patents 4.461,770, 4.528,298 and 4.584.310 (EP 004 648 A) describe 4-{5-aryl)-5-{4-heteroaryl)imidazole derivatives which are substituted in the 2-posltion via a thio, sulfinyl or sulfonyl group by a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon and which, inter alia, have anti-inflammatory action. Imidazole compounds having immunomoduiating and cytokine-release-inhibiting action are described in WO 02/066458, WO 02/076951 and DE 102 22 103. Further imidazole compounds having anti-inflammatory action are described in WO 96/03387, EP 005 545 (US 4.440,776; 4.355.039; 4,269.847), EP 236 628 (US 4.686,231), DE 35 04 678, US 4,190,666, US 4,402.960 and US 4.585.771. EP 372 445 (US 5.318,984; US 5.166,214) and US 5.364,875 describe imidazole compounds having antihypercholesterolemic activity,<br>
WO 00/17192 (DE 198 42 833) relates to 4-heteroaryl-5-phenylimidazole derivatives which are substituted in the 2-positiGn by a phenylalkylthio group. These compounds act as anti-inflammatories and inhibitors of cytokine release, WO 99/03837 and WO 93/14081 describe 2-substituted imidazoles which inhibit the synthesis of a number of inflammatory cytokines. The compounds descnbed in WO 93/14081 have in the 2-<br>

position, attached via a sulfur atom, a phosphorus-containing substituent or an aryl or heteroan/l substituent. WO 91/10662 and WO 91/13876 describe imidazole derivatives which inhibit the acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol-0-acyl transferase and binding of thromboxane TxAa. WO 95/00501 describes imidazole derivatives which can be used as cyclooxygenase inhibitors.<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 3927-37 describes compounds having 5-tipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-inhibiting action, 2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl-5-(pyrid-4-yl)imidazole also having cytokine-inhibiting action.<br>
Further 2-thio-substituted imidazole derivatives are described in JP 01-040 467, SU 1 415 725, Acta Chim. 1969,61,69-77, J. prakt. Chem, 1972, 314, 785-792 and DE 101 14 775, Indian J, Chem,. Sect.

In spite of the fact that numerous compounds are known, there is therefore still a need for compounds having anti-inflammatory action which inhibit cytokine release.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide such compounds.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain 2-substituted imidazole derivatives have high immunomodulating and/or cytokine-release inhibiting activity.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can be prepared in a corresponding manner according to the processes described in the state of the art mentioned at the outset, in particular WO 00/17192. The preparation according to the following two-step process has been found to be particularly expedient. In the first step, a substituted imidazole-2-thione of the formula II is initially prepared. In the second step, this is then reacted such that the 2-thlo-substituted imidazole derivatives of the formula 1 are obtained with introduction of the desired substituent R^.<br><br>
1)       Preparation of the imida2Qle-2-thione<br>
lmidazole-2-thiones where R^ = H, halogen {Br, CI, F), 0-alkyl or S-alkyl are prepared according to process A or B. By way of example, process A is illustrated for compounds in which R^ is 4-fiuorophenyl and R^ is H, process B is illustrated for compounds in which R^ is 4-f]uorophenyl and R^ is CI, (25a), F (25b) or 0-alkyl (25c, 25d) (the numbers in brackets refer to the numbers of the examples). 2-Thio-substituted imidazole derivatives where R^ = NR*R^° are not prepared from the corresponding imidazole-2-thiones where R^ = NR*R^° but in a different manner according to process C. 2-Thio-substituted imidazole derivatives where R^ = 0-alkyl or S-alkyI can be prepared both according to process C and according to process B.<br>
M/43166-PCT<br><br>
Process A<br>
The synthesis of the substituted imidazole-2"thiones where R^ = H is carried out according to (he course of the reaction of scheme 1, using ethyl isonicotinate and 4-fluorophenylacetonlthle as starting materials.<br>
The starting materials are converted in a condensation reaction with the aid of metallic sodium In an alcohol, for example ethanol, into 2-cyano-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-{4-pyrldyl)ethanone (Ilia). The cyano group Is then removed by hydrolysis, for example with hydrobromic acid, and decarboxylation, giving 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(4-pyridyl)ethanone (IVa). in the next step, IVa is converted by treatment with ammonium chloride/sodium acetate in an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol, Into the oxime (Va). By reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride In pyridine, the latter Is converted Into the tosylate (Via). From the tosylate, the thione compound (lla) Is obtained by treatment with sodium ethoxide and reaction of the azirene intermediate formed with potassium thiocyanate.<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
Synthesis of the thiones according to the Invention according to process A<br>
vl/43166-PCT<br><br><br>
Process B:<br>
The preparation of the compounds according to the invention in which the pyridine radical has a halogen, 0-a(kyl or S-alkyI substituent is carried out according to scheme 2 via corresponding 2-halopyridyl-substituted imidazolthiones (process B). The preparation of these imidazolthiones Is illustrated using the 2-fluoro-substituted pyridinine compound (R^ = 2-F} where R"" = p-fluorophenyl as an example. Imidazolthiones carrying, in position 4, alkyl and cycloalkyl radicals (R^ = Ci-C4-alkyl, Ca-Cz-cycloalkyI) are obtained in an analogous manner starting with the appropriately substituted 2-fluoro-Y-picollne ketones.<br>
Scheme 2: M/43i66-PCT<br><br><br>
Y-Picoline (R^ = H) and the halogen- (R^ = F, CI, Br, 1), melhoxy- (R^ = OCH3) and methylthio- (24, R^ = SCH3) substituted y-picolines are lithiated in the Y"fi^ethyl group with exclusion of moisture, in solvents suitable for this purpose, such as hydrocarbons, ethers and mixtures thereof {for example hexane, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene glycol, dimethyl ether), using lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and then condensed with suitable carboxylic acid derivatives (R"-COOR, R"-C0NR2, R^-CN). Here, the amides of the N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine (R^-CONCHgiOCHa), 20) have been found to be particularly suitable. Using nitrites and bases, for example amyl nitrite /sodium methoxide, or using alkali metal nitrite and acid, the y-picolyl ketones (IVb) formed are nitrosated in the y-picoiyl position. The reaction of the y-picolyl ketone, dissolved in glacial acetic acid, with aqueous sodium nitrite solution has been found to be particularly advantageous. During this reaction, the nitrosoketones are converted completely into the tautomeric oxime ketones (Vllb).<br>
The oxime ketones are reduced in alcoholic solution in the presence of hydrogen and mineral acids, for example HCI, using pailadium-on-carbon, to give the ammonium salts of the amine ketones (Vfllb) (23b). M/43166-PCT<br><br>
Alternatively, other oxime ketones can be reduced in alcoholic solution in the presence of mineral acids, for example H2SO4, using zinc dust, to give the corresponding ammonium ketones {23f).<br>
These ammonium ketone compounds afford, after action of alkali metal Ihiocyanates, for example potassium thiocyaaate in dry dimethyifoTmamide (OMF) with heal.mg under reflux, the imidazolethlones of the formula lib where R^ = F, CI, Br, 0-alkyI or S-alkyI, as yellow solids (24b).<br>
The preparation of the compounds according to the invention in which the pyridine radical has an ether (R^ = 0R"°), thioether (R^ = SR^°) or amino substituent {R^ = NR""R^°) is carried out according to scheme 4 or scheme 5, via corresponding 2-halopyridyl-substituted imidazolethiones (process G, see below).<br>
2)       Preparation of the 2-thioimidazole compound<br>
The imidazolettiione compounds of the formula II obtained according to process A or B are, by substitution of the sulfur atom in the 2-position, converted into the compounds of the formula t according to the invention. The substitutions, as shown in an exemplary manner for some compounds in scheme 3, are carried out in a known manner using a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Here, the compound lla or lib is reacted with R^-X in an inert polar solvent, such as an alcohol. X is an easily exchangeable group, such as Hal, in particular CI, Br, I, methylsulfonyl, tosyl, etc. Suitable processes are known to the person skilled in the art and described, for example, in WO 00/17192, EP 0 372 445 and US 4.440,776. The compounds R^-X are known or can be prepared by known processes as described, for example, in WO 00/17192.<br>
Scheme 3:<br>
3. Substitution of the sulfur by alkyi halides and arylalkyi halides or alcohol sulfonates.<br>
3.1.<br>
M/43166-PCT<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The reaction is expediently carried out in the amine in question, which is preferably employed in an amount of from 5 to 20 mole equivalents per mole equivalent of the compound (lb). The reaction temperature is generally in the range from 100 to 200°C, If desired, it is also possible to use an inert solvent, such as dioxane, dimethylformamide, diethylacetamide, tetraethylurea, methylpyrrolidone, etc., and appropriate additives, such as alkali metal carbonates or monovalent copper halides (to neutralize acid equivalents released or to catalyze the elimination of halogen).<br>
The compounds according to the invention in which R^ is an alkoxy substituent or alkylthio substituent (R^ = 0-Ci-Cs-alkyl, S-Ci-Cs-alkyI) can not only be prepared by process B (starting with appropriately substituted picolines) but also by process C. starting with the 4(5}"(2-ha(opyridin-4-yl)-substituted 2-thioimidazoIes.<br>
Process D:<br>
The compounds according to the invention in which R^ is an alkoxy substituent (R^ = O-Ci-Ce-alkyI) can not only be prepared by process B or C, but also by process D, starting with the 4(5)-(2-halopyridin-4-yl)-substituted 2-thjoimidazoles. The process is illustrated in scheme 5, using the 2-isopropyloxypyridinine compounds (R^ = OCH(CH3)2) where R^ = p-fluorophenyl as an example.<br>
The starting materials (lb) can be prepared by the processes described above. Scheme 5:<br><br><br>
The reaction is expediently carried out in the alcohol, which is preferably used in an amount of from 5 to 20 mole equivalents per mole equivalent of the compound (lb), in the case of lower alcohols also up to one hundred mole equivalents, in the presence of a strong acid, such as HCI or trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, etc. The reaction temperature is generally within the boiling range of the lower alcohols, in the case of higher alcohols in the range from 100 to 200°C. It has been found to be favorable, for example, to saturate the alcohol with gaseous HCI, or to re-saturate during the reaction.<br>
Alternatively, the exchange of fluorine for alkoxy in the 2-position of the pyridyl substituent can be carried out at an earlier stage in the synthesis, for example at the stage of the oxime ketones or the amine ketones. In these cases, the reactions proceed under conditions comparable to those just described for intermediate lb (22c).<br>
Processes E, F and G:<br>
The compounds according to the invention in which R^ is an amido substituent (R^ = NR^C0R"°) are, firstly, prepared from the 4(5)-(2-halopyndin-4-yl)-substituted 2-thioimidazoles. The process (process E) is illustrated in scheme 6.1 using the 2-benzoylamido (R^ = NH-COPh) where R^ = p-fluorophenyl as an example. Secondly, after the hydrolysis of the amides to the amine-substituted (R^ = NR^H, NHR^°) 2-thioimidazoles and their re-acylation or derivatization to amides, ureas and urethanes, furttier amido substituents may be obtained (process F). This is illustrated in scheme 6.2. Thirdly, 2-aminopyridine precursor compounds may be obtained from 4(5)-(2-halopyhdin-4-yl) compounds via the 4(5)-(2-azidopyridin-4-yl) compounds (process G). In this variant, the halogen is substituted nucleophilically by an alkali metal azide, and the azide group is then converted by reduction methods into the amino group, see scheme 6.3,<br>
Process H:<br>
M/43166-PCT<br><br>
This interesting variant also allows access to alkylated amines from aldehyde and ketone precursors. If the conversion of the azide group into the amino group is carried out under hydrogenation conditions using a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of these aldehydes and ketones, alkylated amines where R^ = NHCH2-B or NHCH(alkyl)-B are obtained (process H, scheme 6.4). The same result is obtained when the azide is cleaved with a phosphine to give the phosphimide, and these imides obtained after an aza-Wittig reaction with an aldehyde {or ketone) are reduced to the amines using complex hydrides {process H, scheme 6.5).<br>
The starting materials (lb) can be prepared by the processes described above. Scheme 6:<br><br>
The reaction is expediently carried out in the amide in question, which is preferably employed in an amount of from 5 to 20 mole equivalents per mole equivalent of the compound (lb). The reaction temperature is generally in the range from 100 to 200""C. If desired, it is also possible to use an inert solvent, such as dioxane, dimethylformamide, diethylacetamide, tetraethylurea, methylpyrrolidone, etc., and appropriate additives, such as alkali metal carbonates or monovalent copper halides (to neutralize acid equivalents released or to catalyze the elimination of halogen).<br>
The 2-aminopyridine compounds can be obtained from 2-amidoacylpyridines by hydrolysis   (6.2)   or else  by  azide  substitution   of the  2-fluoro  compounds  and<br>
M/43166-PCT<br><br>
subsequent reduction of the 2-azidopyndines (6.3), for example by hydragenation on palladium-on-carbon in alcoholic solvents.<br><br>
M/43166-PCT<br><br><br>
Further conversions of the amines obtained {Ik, id) by derivatization are possible (process F). What is used are reactions of the amines Id and Ik both with acid anhydrides and acid chlorides to give further amides, and also reactions with chloroformic esters to give urethanes, with isocyanates to give ureas and with acyl isocyanates to give acylureas. These formations of derivatives are illustrated in scheme 7.<br>
