				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an improved inflation, operation and protection (IOP) process for all types of Tube Type Tyre' those comprising of Tyre Air Seal' (TAS),' Tubeless Inflation Valve' and 'Soluble Fibres composition' also 'Air / Inflation Pressure' as in conventional modes and more specifically for all those tyres those are to be mount with 'Conventional Rim unit' particularly known as Cylindrical Bead Seat Rim use with spokes, Divided Type Rim, One Piece Rim, Two Pieces and Three Pieces (Semi Drop Centre only) Rim and also Four Pieces Rim in which Tube Type Pneumatic Tyre' allow removal of 'Inner Rubber Tube' and introducing new improved process for inflating them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modern pneumatic tyres for vehicles are of two types as shown in Figure 1. The first of these is so called Tube Types Tyre' as shown in Figure 1A which is designed to be mounted directly upon 'Conventional Rim unit' by means of a separate 'Inner Rubber Tube' having an integral inflation device which projects through the wheel rim valve hole. Conventional Tube Type Tyres may be 'Bias (Diagonal / Cross / Nylon) Ply' or 'Radial Ply'. The second type of these is so called Tubeless Tyre' as shown in Figure 1B which has an inner lining of rubber having a low permeability to air and which is designed to be mounted directly on to the Tubeless Rim' to make the wheel of vehicle and inflated by means of an separate inflation device which is so called as Tubeless Inflation Valve' inserted on to the wheel rim valve hole.<br><br><br>
It is well known that tyre life and vehicle safety depend largely on tyres being maintained at the recommended inflation pressure, which varies with the vehicle-tyre combination, tyre location on the vehicle and also operating and weather conditions.<br>
The tube type tyres those inflate with the help of inner rubber tube suffer the problems of rubber porosity, generation of high heat, uneven distribution of weight of assembly and sudden deflation in case of puncture. Also the tubeless tyres those inflate only upon Tubeless rim (single piece or mono block) with the help of extra rubber lining on bead of tyre and hump lock whether flat or round which is provided on taper seat of rim suffer the problem of repairs of even smaller puncture area with sharp object, irregular air pressure, porosity leaks, bead leaks and also not capable to inflate on conventional rims like divided type rim, cylindrical bead seat rim, two and three pieces rim.<br>
The prior art of tyre inflation process suffer certain disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages is ride characteristics do not match the comfort ability because tyre works on the basis of tread area because of inner rubber tube and also suffers the problem of weather.<br>
Furthermore, while 'Conventional Tube Type Tyres' explode in case of puncture or Cross cuts, the so-called "Tubeless" too, get flabby at zero level quite soon, also explode in case of particular stress and for what concerns lowered the life of tyres, also irregularity in air pressure so damage the rim when it hits certain obstacles or runs onto terrains.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a system and method for converting tube-tyre system into tube-less tyre and/or slowing vehicle tyre deflation.<br>
The method of the present invention comprises the steps of providing a tyre air seal made of rubber having a hole to adapt a tubeless inflation valve; mounting the tyre air seal over a conventional rim; fitting the tubeless inflation valve on the rim for inflating the tyre; mounting the tyre over the tyre air seal; injecting soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition through the inflation valve; and inflating the tyre with air through the inflation valve; wherein the tyre air seal in combination with tyre and rim forms a compartment for air capable to hold and retain air pressure within chamber with the help of hydro dynamical properties i.e. moisture, drops or layer of substance of fibres, filler and rubber within inner periphery of tyre; and wherein the soluble substance maintains moisture within the compartment maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber thereby actuating transfer of force on sidewalls of the tyre instead of tread area and minimizing friction, force and stress between the rim and the tyre.<br>
The system of the present invention comprises a conventional rim; a tyre air seal made of rubber for rim and having a hole to adapt a inflation valve; a tubeless inflation valve; a soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition to be injected between the tyre and the rim for maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber; wherein the tyre air seal in combination with tyre and rim forms a compartment for air and the soluble substance maintains moisture within the compartment maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber<br><br><br>
thereby actuating transfer of force on sidewalls of the tyre instead of tread area and minimizing friction, force and stress between the rim and the tyre.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This new model comprises of an improved process by which 'Conventional Tyre' to fit out with 'Conventional rim unit' without the use of inner rubber tube so the air pressure troubles reduced with this invention also in exercise allow maintenance of ambient inflation pressure and identical temperature within tyre at optimum level, more safety and possibility of using very soft mix.<br>
The process of 'Fibre Touch Tyre Inflation System' has been designed and formulated to stimulate and improve the drive and ride characteristics of conventional tyres. By application of new improved process tyres possess several advantages particularly slower deflation characteristics and high gripping properties on road upon sudden application of brakes, high cushioning capabilities because tyre works on the basis of sidewalls instead of tread area as<br><br>
well as safety too. Also the proposed invention successfully solves the other problems, because it provides us a low cost technique as well as trouble free operation at optimum level.<br>
Finally, Figure 2 shows a system for converting tube-tyre system into tube-less tyre and/or<br>
slowing vehicle tyre deflation comprising the conventional tyre on a conventional rim inflated<br>
with the help of improved tubeless inflation valve, tyre air seal (TAS) and a soluble liquid<br>
substance of fibres, fillers and rubbers instead of inner rubber tube by a method comprising<br>
steps of providing a tyre air seal made of rubber having a hole to adapt a tubeless inflation<br>
valve; mounting the tyre air seal over a conventional rim; fitting the tubeless inflation valve on<br>
the rim for inflating the tyre; mounting the tyre over the tyre air seal; injecting soluble substance<br>
of fibre, fillers or rubber composition through the inflation valve; and inflating the tyre with air<br>
through the inflation valve; wherein the tyre air seal in combination with tyre and rim forms a<br>
compartment for air capable to hold and retain air pressure within chamber with the help of<br>
hydro dynamical properties i.e. moisture, drops or layer of substance of fibres, filler and rubber<br>
within inner periphery of tyre; and wherein the soluble substance maintains moisture within the<br>
compartment maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber thereby actuating<br>
transfer of force on sidewalls of the tyre instead of tread area and minimizing friction, force and<br>
stress between the rim and the tyre. The present system and method able in both on and off the<br>
road operational mode whether smooth, terrain and sandy surface and have ability to flex, resist<br>
heat, prevent rust, perform and saves environment, fuel, rubber, money, labour and handling<br>
time and also requirement of minimum number of repairs, reduction in buffing or curing time<br>
because of minimize retreads also repair unit selection is simplified except insertion of 'soluble<br>
fibers' in case of deficiency and air pressure also repairs the tyres on the wheel in few minutes<br><br><br>
or seconds as shown in Figures 3-9. The application strongly recommended for the structure of four ply rating and above including 'off the road tyres' and Radial ply. It offers high mileage, greater strength, superior construction of well and the capabilities of softer ride, silent running, terrain adaptable, higher or lower load and speed, whether proof, to seal up the porosity of rubber in tyre and also have been prove safe and dependable on the road miles. The process is also allow for easy installation and designed for care of tyre through compact and even fit, enable excellent grip, braking, cornering and handling ability on both wet and dry roads, also retention of ambient air pressure and identical temperature with maneuverability within well which highly reduce or resistance of shoulder cuts and bigger size cross cuts. This process is not a miracle but a technique of science in which every process is designed not only to protect but to avoid dangerous situation in Domestic, Commercial and Industrial including 'Off the Road' vehicles in both ON and OFF road operational mode without operator intervention.<br>
The basic principle as shown in Fig. 10 of the improved process of inflation, operation and<br>
protection is to be define and describe as 'To seal up' the 'Bead of Tyre' with 'Taper seat of Rim'<br>
with the help of new technique / skills, newly invented basic and essential tools or apparatus<br>
and substances of fibres, fillers and rubbers in which the centrifugal forces of inflation pressure<br>
acts upon substance likely it distribute itself throughout the tyre aligning the centre of gravity<br>
with geometric centre of the wheel and on the same new invented 'tyre air seal' and IOP<br>
process helps for acceptance and maintenance of air pressure by and within the tyre. This<br>
design is applicable for all type of 'Conventional Tyres with Conventional Rim unit' subject to an<br>
essential criterion is that the 'Bead of Tyre' and Taper Seat of Rim' shall not be in damaged and<br>
deformed manner respectively.<br><br>
The softy and soluble composition are flow able within the vehicle tyre, which moves and foams flexible seal within the tyre as it rotates and acts, and also to reduce the size of any puncture and avoid cross cuts in tyre during operation, whereby to prevent sudden loss of air there from. In the event of a small conventional puncture onto the tyre due to a nail or a thorn, the process is enough capable 'to auto seal up' the rubber porosity, multiple conventional puncture area within second thereby maintaining the air pressure inside the tyre. The process is not enough capable in case of bigger size cross cuts or caused punctures in sidewalls.<br>
It is well known that tyre and tube have a nearby relation with repairs of it to obtain the air tightness with rim and also it is well known that the contact between the tyre and rim is a very important factor with respect to the air tightness there between. By this improved process, inflation pressure is maintained there by reducing sudden deflation characteristics of the tyre and chance of sudden zero pressure is minimized. This improved process of inflation, operation and protection also provides us even distribution characteristics of weight of wheel assembly of vehicle and tyre due to its hydro dynamical properties in operation. As a result it minimizes repairs, retreads and re-grooves those are needed frequently, thus increasing the life and cushioning level of a conventional tyre. Also in case of need the tyres are enough capable to repairs the tyre 'on the wheel' in said invention.<br>
Finally, according to present invention when tyres of vehicles fitted with the help of 'Fibre touch tyre inflation system for converting tube-tyre system into tube-less tyre and/or slowing vehicle tyre deflation', the tyre acts as an extra shock absorber to the vehicle as the tyre operates and works on the basis of 'Sidewalls' instead of 'Tread area'. Therefore, minimum use of the tread<br><br>
area is accomplished and the side walls of the tyre is used at a optimum level, thus providing a high level of cushioning and even higher gripping properties on road in sudden application of brakes. The advantages of this process according to the invention are obvious, this process gives rise to an improved adhesion, eliminates detrimental skidding of the wheel of a vehicle onto the road miles in the occasion of braking, easy bends at high speed and in case of sharp starts of rear drive vehicles. The sharp braking constitute one of the most important aspect in an emergency situation, with a sharp braking even the tyre in a certain deflection, the wheels stick to a point, and the skidding on the road miles does not happens or occurs also the possibility to steer efficiently in case of need.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for converting tube-tyre system into tube-less tyre and/or slowing vehicle tyre<br>
deflation, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a tyre air seal made of rubber having a hole to adapt a tubeless inflation<br>
valve;<br>
mounting the tyre air seal over a conventional rim;<br>
fitting the tubeless inflation valve on the rim for inflating the tyre;<br>
mounting the tyre over the tyre air seal;<br>
injecting soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition through the inflation valve; and<br>
inflating the tyre with air through the inflation valve; wherein the tyre air seal in combination with tyre and rim forms a compartment for air capable to hold and retain air pressure within chamber with the help of hydro dynamical properties i.e. moisture, drops or layer of substance of fibres, filler and rubber within inner periphery of tyre; and<br>
wherein the soluble substance maintains moisture within the compartment maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber thereby actuating transfer of force on sidewalls of the tyre instead of tread area and minimizing friction, force and stress between the rim and the tyre.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition can be known puncture sealant.<br>
3.	A system for converting tube-tyre system into tube-less tyre and/or slowing vehicle tyre<br><br><br>
deflation, the system comprising;<br>
a conventional rim;<br>
a tyre air seal made of rubber for rim and having a hole to adapt a inflation valve;<br>
a tubeless inflation valve;<br>
a soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition to be injected between the tyre<br>
and the rim for maintaining the pressure and temperature within the chamber;<br>
wherein the tyre air seal in combination with tyre and rim forms a compartment for air<br>
and the soluble substance maintains moisture within the compartment maintaining the<br>
pressure and temperature within the chamber thereby actuating transfer of force on<br>
sidewalls of the tyre instead of tread area and minimizing friction, force and stress<br>
between the rim and the tyre.<br>
4.	The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the rim can be a 'One Piece Rim', 'Cylindrical Bead Seat Rim use with Spokes', 'Divided Type Rim' , 'Two and Three pieces (Semi Drop Centre) Rim' and 'Four Pieces Rim'.<br>
5.	The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the soluble substance of fibre, fillers or rubber composition can be known puncture sealant.<br>
6.	The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein each piece of rim has separate tyre air seal.</td>
