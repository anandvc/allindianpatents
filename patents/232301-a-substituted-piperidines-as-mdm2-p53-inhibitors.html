Substituted piperidines as novel MDM2-p53 inhibitors<br>
The present invention provides a novel series of piperidines with ris-3,4-dialkoxy substitutions represented by formula (I):<br><br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; wherein<br>
n       is an integer independently selected from 1 or 2;<br>
X      is halogen;<br>
R1     is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, carbon)7!, sulfonyl, lower alkyl, and lower alkyl substituted by carbonyl, sulfonyl, or hydroxy,<br>
R12    is selected from the group consisting of alkyl or alkenyl having from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms, and <br>
wherein R to R   are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, -CN, -N02, CF3, -OCH3, -COOCH3, and -C6H5.;<br><br>
R2 to R6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, . lower alkyl, -C(CH3)3, CF3, -OCH3, -N02, and -CN;<br>
and in case R12 is alkyl or alkenyl having from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms, R2 to R6 are hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of formula I are small molecule inhibitors of MDM2-p53 interaction. These compounds are useful in the treatment or control of cancer.<br>
p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a central role in protection against the development of cancer. p53 guards cellular integrity and prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones of cells by the induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. At the molecular level, p53 is a transcription factor that can activate a panel of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 is a potent cell cycle inhibitor, which is tightly regulated by MDM2 at the cellular level. MDM2 and p53 form a feedback control loop. MDM2 can bind p53 and inhibit its ability to transactivate p53-regulated genes. In addition, MDM2 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. p53 can activate the expression of the MDM2 gene, thus raising the cellular level of MDM2 protein. This feedback control loop insures that both MDM2 and p53 are kept at a low level in normal proliferating cells. MDM2 is also a cofactor for E2F, which plays a central role in cell cycle regulation.<br>
The ratio of MDM2 to p53 (E2F) is deregulated in many cancers. Frequently occurring molecular defects in the pl6INK4/pl9ARF locus, for instance, have been shown to affect MDM2 protein degradation. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in tumor cells with wild-type p53 should lead to accumulation of p53, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. MDM2 antagonists, therefore, can offer a novel approach to cancer therapy as single agents or in combination with a broad spectrum of other antitumor therapies. The feasibility of this strategy has been shown by the use of different macromolecular tools for inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (e.g. antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, peptides). MDM2 also binds E2F through a conserved binding region as p53 and activates E2F-dependent transcription of cyclin A, suggesting that MDM2 antagonists might have effects in p53 mutant cells.<br>

Furthermore, the invention provides the use of a compound represented by formula (II) or (III) for the preparation of medicaments for treating cancer.<br>
The present invention provides a novel series of small molecule inhibitors of MDM2-p53 interaction, piperidines with a5-3,4-dialkoxy substitutions, which have been tested in ELISA assays. The most potent compounds in this series have been shown to inhibit interaction of MDM2 protein with a p53-like peptide with a potency that is approximately the same as a p53-derived peptide. Binding of these compounds to the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 protein has been confirmed by NMR studies of selected compounds in this series as well as fragments of these compounds. These compounds have been shown to bind the same binding pockets as ris-imidazolines, which have demonstrated clear mechanistic activity in cell-based assays as well as antiproliferative activity against wild-type-p53 containing tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore these compounds are useful as anticancer agents.<br>

Schemes 1-3 outline a general method for preparing compounds of the invention having formula (II) and (III) using a novel solid phase synthesis. Scheme 4 outlines a general method for preparing the compounds in solution phase. Scheme 5 illustrates various methods for modifying the Rj group using a novel polymer supported reagent<br>
In Scheme 1, the protection of a secondary amine of a commercially available 4-aryl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine is outlined. The preferred protecting group is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl, which can be synthesized from known procedures (Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M, 2nd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N. Y. 1991). For liquid phase synthesis, the resulting tert-butyi ester can be treated with OsCVNMO to form the dihydroxy intermediate A. Selective o-alkylation of intermediate A at C3 can be carried out using NaH and 4-methoxybenzyl chloride. The resulting intermediate can be benzylated according to known methods. Deprotection of both 4-methoxylbenzyl and tert-butyloxycarbonyl groups using 50% TFA/CH2CI2 yields 4-aryl-4-benzyloxy-3-hydroxypiperidine B. For solid phase synthesis, the resulting piperidine B can be coupled to a suitable linker, such as a chloromethyl derivative ArgoPore-Cl linker (Argonaut). Alkylation on solid phase can be accomplished using f-BuOK to generate the anion followed by coupling with various alkyl halides (RX). The final reaction product can be cleaved from the N-benzyl linked tertiary amine linker using a/p/za-chloroethyl chloroformat (ACE-Cl)/MeOH to give the piperidine compounds of the invention (Leysen, D. et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997,2915-2918).<br><br><br><br>
coupling of the resulting 4-aryl-3,4-dihydro:^iperidine with a ArgoPore-Cl linker. Dialkylation using f-BuOK and alkyl halides (RX) followed by cleavage of the polymer support according to the described conditions affords the piperidine compounds of the invention.<br><br>
In Scheme 4, a general synthetic method is outlined for preparing compounds of formula (II) and (IE) in solution phase. Sequential alkylation of intermediate A using NaH and alkyl halides followed by acidic deprotection of tert-butyloxycarbonyl provides the piperidine compounds of the invention.<br><br>
In Scheme 5, a general method is outlined for the post-modification of intermediate C. The secondary amine of intermediate C can be treated with a variety of agents such as acyl chlorides, alkyl halides, and sulfonyl chlorides to form the corresponding amide, tert-amine, or sulfonamide. The intermediate C can also be allylated using polymer support BEMP and allyl iodide to form the N-allyl substituted intermediate, which can be further treated with OSO4/NMO to form 3-propane-1,2-diol-substituted piperidines of the invention.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the examples below. The examples are presented for purposes of demonstrating, but not limiting, the preparation of the compounds and compositions of this invention.<br>

After the addition was complete, the mixture was stirred with ice cooling for 15 minutes. Then 3,4-dichloroben2yl chloride (Aldrich, 239 mg, 1.14 mmol) was added, and the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 20 hours. The mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (30 mL), and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 X15 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2 X 20 mL), saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (1X 20 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give a viscous oil (500 mg), which was purified by flash silica gel chromatography (Merck silica gel 60,230 to 400 mesh) to afford ris-[rac]-4~(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyta^ butyl ester (310 mg, 61%) as a colorless oil.<br><br>

After stirring with ice cooling for ten minutes, benzyl bromide (86 mg, 0.51 mmol) was added followed by N,N-dimethylformamide (0.5 mL). The cooling bath was removed, and the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. Several drops of methanol were added, and the mixture was stirred and room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was'partitioned between ethyl acetate (30 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (15 mL).

In Vitro Activity Assay<br>
The ability of the substituted piperidine compounds of the invention to inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 proteins was measured by an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay) in which recombinant GST-tagged MDM2 binds to a peptide that resembles the MDM2-interacting region of p53 (Bottger et al., J. Mol. Bio. 1997, Vol. 269, pgs. 744-756). This peptide is immobilized to the surface of a 96 well plate via N-terminal biotin, which binds to streptavidin-coated wells. MDM2 is added to each well in the presence of anti-MDM2 mouse monoclonal antibody (SMP-14, Santa Cruz Biotech). After removal of the unbound MDM2 protein, a peroxydase-linked secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the amount of peptide-bound MDM2 is determined colorimetrically by the addition of a peroxydase substrate (MTB Microwell Peroxydase Substrate System, Kirkegaard 8c Perry Labs).<br><br>
Test plates were prepared by coating with streptavidin (5 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 hours followed by a PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) wash and overnight blocking with 150 |jl of blocking buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS at 4°C. Biotinylated peptide (1 \M) is added to each well in 50 \xl of blocking buffer and washed extensively after a 1-hour incubation. Test compounds were diluted in a separate 96 well plate and added in triplicate to a compound incubation plate containing a mix of the MDM2 protein and anti-MDM2 antibody. After 20 minutes incubation, the content of the plate is transferred to the test plate and incubated for an additional 1 hour. The secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody is added to the test plate preceded and followed by a triple wash with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Finally, peroxydase substrate is added to each well and the absorption was read using a plate reader (MR7000, Dynatech) at 450nm. The inhibitory activity of the test compounds was measured as a percentage of the bound MDM2 in treated vs. untreated wells and IC5o was calculated.<br>
The inhibitory activity (IC50) of the compounds prepared in the examples above, and represented by formula (I) or (II), is in the range of 3 joM to 100 pM,<br>
