The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
DRILLING APPARATUS OF PRINTING PRESS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
The entire "disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-084091 filed on March 23, 2004, including specification, claims, drawings, and abstract, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a drilling apparatus of a printing press, which drills (or pierces) holes by a C02 laser in a sheet during a process of transport from a printing unit to a delivery unit.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Publications, such as Japanese Officially<br>
Published Patent Gazette No. 2000-501036 and Japanese Officially Published Patent Gazette No. 2001-503687, disclose counterfeit deterrence technologies by which laser marks are put on, or small holes are drilled in, securities such as checks and stock certificates, or bank notes to form patterns or characters.<br>
Japanese Officially Published Patent Gazette No. 2000-501036 discloses a technology by which a bank<br>
1<br><br>
note, for example, is irradiated with several laser beams from a laser light source at predetermined pulses to form a laser mark on the bank note.  Japanese Officially Published Patent Gazette No. 2001-503687 discloses a technology for forming a predetermined drilled hole pattern in a document by controlling not only the intensity and focal length of laser light generated by computer-controlled laser light generation means, but also the direction of irradiation with laser light.<br>
These laser marks or drilled hole patterns, if viewed in a reflected state, are not visible to an observer without the assistance of optical supplementary means. However, they can be seen with a naked eye, namely, without the help of a technical equipment, if bank notes or documents bearing them are held exposed to light.<br>
By the way, printed patterns, etc. with different motifs, in addition to laser marks or drilled hole patterns, are applied to securities such as checks and stock certificates, or bank notes.<br>
However, laser marks or drilled hole patterns have been formed by dedicated machines (apparatuses) other than printing presses which apply printed patterns, etc. Thus, securities or banknotes, to which printed patterns, etc. have been applied by printing presses, have to be moved to the dedicated machines<br>
2 <br>
(apparatuses) to provide laser marks or drilled hole patterns whenever the laser marks or drilled hole patterns are required. This has posed problems that manufacturing man-hours are longer, a burden on the operator is heavy, and an installation space for such machines is increased, thereby increasing cost and decreasing productivity.<br>
The above-mentioned problems are resolved if laser marks or drilled hole patterns can be formed on the printing press. However, the following problems still remain unsolved: Unstable motions of paper transported at a high speed cause concern about the stability of drilling accuracy of the holes. Moreover, a laser light, which has drilled holes in a part of the paper, maybe reflected and drills holes in undesired parts of the paper.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a drilling apparatus of a printing press, which can form a laser mark or a drilled hole pattern on a printing press with high accuracy.<br>
A drilling apparatus of a printing press includes:  transport means for transporting a sheet, which has been printed in a printing unit, from the printing unit to a sheet delivery unit while holding<br>
3<br><br>
a front end portion of the sheet; a vacuum table for sucking the sheet being transported by the transport means; and a C02 laser, opposing the vacuum table, for directing a laser light at the sheet sucked by the vacuum table to drill holes in the sheet.<br>
The vacuum table may be an acrylic plate having many air suction holes.<br>
A sheet guide member may be provided on a downstream side of the vacuum table with respect to a sheet transport direction, and the sheet guide member may have suction holes communicating with the air suction holes of the vacuum table.<br>
The sheet guide member may have an inclined surface inclined in a direct ion in which the sheet sucked by the vacuum table is peeled off, the inclined surface being inclined from an upstream side in the sheet transport direction toward a downstream side in the sheet transport direction.<br>
The sheet guide member may be formed in a strip shape, and a plurality of the sheet guide members may be disposed with a predetermined spacing in a direction perpendicular to the sheet transport direction in such a manner as to evade the running path of gripper devices of the transport means.<br>
Air blowers for blowing the sheet against a guide surface portion of the vacuum table may be provided on the opposite side of the transport means from the<br>
4<br><br>
vacuum table.<br>
According to the present invention with the above-described features, a laser mark or a drilled hole pattern can be formed on the printing press . Thus, manufacturing man-hours and the burden on the operator can be reduced, and the installation space for the machine can be decreased, so that cost reduction and productivity increases can be achieved. Furthermore, the sheet being sucked by the vacuum table is drilled by the laser light from the C02 laser. Hence, holes can be formed with high accuracy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A drilling apparatus of a printing press according to the present invention will now be described in detail by embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, which in no way limit the invention. Embodiment 1<br>
FIG. 1 shows a schematic confirmation of a sheet-fed printing press according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of a drilling apparatus portion. FIG. 3 is an explanation drawing of a drilling example. FIG. 4 is an explanation drawing of a vacuum table.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a sheet-fed (intaglio) printing press has a feeder 1, a printing unit 2, and a delivery unit (sheet delivery unit) 3.  A drilling apparatus (laser marking system) 4 is provided between the printing unit 2 and the delivery unit 3.<br>
In the feeder 1, stacked sheets W are transferred, one by one, to transfer cylinders 7 and 8 via a feeder board 5 and a swing arm shaft pregripper 6.  The sheet<br>
6<br><br>
W is to be transferred from the transfer cylinder 8 to an impression cylinder 9, which is a triple-size cylinder, of the printing unit 2.<br>
In the printing unit 2, an intaglio cylinder 10, which is a triple-size cylinder, is in contact with a side of the impression cylinder 9 provided downstream of the transfer cylinder 8 in the direction of rotation. Three pattern rollers 11 are in contact with a side of the intaglio cylinder 10 provided downstream of the impression cylinder 9 in the direction of rotation while being located with predetermined spacing in the circumferential direction of the intaglio cylinder 10. Ink fountain devices 12 a re in con tact with these pattern rollers 11.<br>
A prewiping device 13 is installed opposite a side of the intaglio cylinder 10 downstream of the pattern rollers 11 in the direction of rotation. A wiping roller 14 is in contact withasideoftheintaglio cylinder 10 provided downstream of the prewiping device<br>
13	in the direction of rotation.  The wiping roller<br>
14	has a lower-half portion immersed in a wiping tank<br>
15	filled with a wiping solution.<br>
A delivery cylinder 16 is in contact with a side of the impression cylinder 9 downstream of the intaglio cylinder 10 in the direction of rotation. A transport chain (transport means) 17, to which a plurality of gripper devices 17a (see FIG. 2) for receiving the sheet<br>
7<br><br>
W from the impression cylinder 9 are attached with a predetermined spacing, is passed over the delivery cylinder 16. The transport chain 17 runs, while being guided by a chain guide (not shown), to transport the sheet W received from the impression cylinder 9 onto a pile board 19 of the delivery unit 3 after having the sheet W dried by an air blower 18 or the like.<br>
The drilling apparatus 4, as shown in FIG. 2, is equipped with a C02 laser (carbon dioxide gas laser) 21, which is disposed below the transport chain 17 for directing a plurality of beams of laser light 20 at the sheet W being transported by the transport chain 17 to drill holes in the sheet W, and a vacuum table 25 which is disposed above the transport chain 17 opposing the CO2 laser 21 for sucking the sheet W being transported by the transport chain 17.<br>
The CO2 laser (apparatus) 21, as shown in FIG. 3, drills a plurality of holes 22, which are small enough to be minimally discernible by a naked eye, in a printed part of the sheet W printed with a bank note or the like, thereby forming a drilled hole pattern such as a design, a character, or a figure.<br>
The vacuum table 25 has a thin-box shape, and is provided with a guide surface portion 26 including an acrylic plate on its side facing the transport chain 17. Taper pieces (sheet guide members) 28 are annexed to a downstream side of the guide surface portion 26<br>
8<br><br>
in the direction of sheet transport (sheet transport direction) . In the illustrated example, the interior of the vacuum table 25 is partitioned into four chambers, which are each in communication with a vacuum source (not shown) via a vacuum hose 24.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, many air suction holes 27 are formed in the guide surface portion 26 of the vacuum table 25. Moreover, each taper piece 28 is provided with an inclined surface 28a inclined in a direction in which the sheet W sucked by the vacuum table 25 is gradually peeled off from an upstream side in the sheet transport direction toward a downstream side in the sheet transport direction.<br>
The taper piece 28 has a strip shape, and a plurality of the taper pieces 28 are disposed with a predetermined spacing in a sheet width direction in such a manner as to evade the running path of the gripper devices 17a (strictly, grippers) so as not to interfere with the gripper devices 17a. Each of the taper pieces 28 is bolted to the vacuum table 25. That is, the taper pieces 28 are configured such that a groove 29 is formed between the adjacent taper pieces 28. Furthermore, suction holes 28b communicating with the air suction holes 27 are formed in a guide surface portion including the inclined surface 28a of the taper piece 28, but the suction holes 28b may be omitted.<br>
Because of the foregoing features, when the<br>
9<br><br>
sheet W is fed from the feeder 1 onto the feeder board 5, the sheet W is transferred from the swing arm shaft pregripper 6 to the transfer cylinder 7, and then to the impression cylinder 9 via the transfer cylinder 8.<br>
When ink is supplied from the ink fountain device 12 to the intaglio cylinder 10 via the pattern roller 11, a surplus of this ink is removed by the prewiping device 13 and the wiping roller 14, whereafter the remaining ink is transferred to the sheet W held by the impression cylinder 9.  During this process, inks from the three pattern rollers 11 are directly transferred to the intaglio cylinder 10.  Thus, a so-called three-color intaglio direct printing is performed, and a print (3-color) with a thick ink film can be made.<br>
The so printed sheet W is transferred from the impression cylinder 9 to the gripper devices 17a of the transport chain 17 at the delivery cylinder 16. Then, the sheet W is transported to the drilling apparatus 4 by the transport chain 17 running along the chain guide. After a predetermined drilled hole pattern is formed in the sheet W by the drilling apparatus 4, the sheet W is delivered in a stacked state on the pile board 19.<br>
The ordinary sheet W is a light, easily deformable material, and its shape tends to be<br>
10<br><br>
influenced by the flow of air.  Thus, while the sheet W gripped by the gripper devices 17a is being transported at a high speed, the sheet W cannot maintain a flat posture, but is deformed, with the result that a continuous instable motion of the sheet W occurs.<br>
In the present embodiment, on the other hand, air is blown from the air blower 18 onto the unstably behaving sheet W, whereby the sheet W is blown against the guide surface portion 26 of the vacuum table 25 without sagging. Then, air is sucked by the many air suction holes 27 formed in the guide surface portion 26, whereby the sheet W is attracted to the guide surface portion 26. The attracted sheet W is transported by the gripper devices 17a while being attracted to the guide surface portion 26.<br>
With the sheet W being thus blown against and attracted to the guide surface portion, namely, its unstable behavior being suppressed, the sheet W is irradiated with the laser light 20 by the C02 laser (apparatus) 21 to form a predetermined drilled hole pattern. The sheet W after formation of the pattern is peeled off laboriously by the inclined surface 28a of the taper piece 28. That is, the instability of the trailing edge of the sheet due to a rapid release from the suction force at the trailing edge of the sheet is prevented, and thus the sheet is smoothly transported.<br>
11<br><br>
In the present embodiment, as described above, a predetermined drilled hole pattern can be formed on the printing press . Thus, manufacturing man-hours and the burden on the operator can be reduced, and the installation space for the machine can be decreased, so that cost reduction and productivity increases can be achieved.<br>
Furthermore, the sheet W being sucked by the vacuum table 25 is irradiated with the laser light 20, and drilled thereby. Thus, a hole drilling error by the laser light 20 is reduced, and only the hole drilling can be performed with high accuracy by the laser light 20 from the CO2 laser 21, with the surroundings of the holes in the sheet W not being burned.  Besides, the guide surface portion 26 is formed from the acrylic plate which is a material that highly absorbs the light .• Thus, injury due to reflection of the laser light 20, and damage to the vacuum table 25 can be prevented. Embodiment 2<br>
FIG. 5 shows a schematic confirmation of a sheet-fed printing press according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention.<br>
This is an example having the following features:  A collecting cylinder 30 is in contact with the intaglio cylinder 10 in Embodiment 1.  Inks from ink fountain devices 12 are transferred to the collecting cylinder 30 via three pattern rollers 31.<br>
12<br><br>
A pattern roller 32 is in contact with the intaglio cylinder 10 located downstream of the collecting cylinder 30 in the direction of rotation. Ink from an ink fountain device 12 is transferred to the pattern roller 32 via suitable transfer rollers. The other features are the same as those in FIG. 1. Thus, the same members as in FIG. 1 will be assigned the same numerals as in FIG. 1, and duplicate explanations will be omitted.<br>
According to this embodiment, inks from the three pattern rollers 31 are transferred to the intaglio cylinder 10 via the collecting cylinder 30, and ink from the one pattern roller 32 is directly transferred to the intaglio cylinder 10. This has an advantage that a so-called three-color intaglio indirect printing, and a one-color intaglio direct printing are performed, whereby a print (3-color) with a thin ink film and a print (1-color) with a thick ink film can be made. Other actions and effects are the same as those in Embodiment 1.<br>
While the present invention has been described by the above embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereby, but may be varied or modified in many other ways . For example, the laser light 20 is directed upward in each of the embodiments. However, the C02 laser 21 and the vacuum table 25 may be placed reversely with respect to the delivery chain<br>
13<br><br>
17, or their placements may be rotated, whereby the laser light 20 may be directed downward or sideways. Moreover, it goes without saying that an unprinted part of the sheet W may be drilled by the CO2 laser 21. Such variations or modifications are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such variations and modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
