SADDLE FOR BICYCLES<br>
The invention concerns a saddle for bicycles, particularly suitable to be used<br>
on sports and racing bicycles.<br>
It is known that saddles for bicycles include a column coupled to the bicycle<br>
frame and supporting the supporting element of a seat on which the cyclist sits.<br>
In particular the seat has a modelled shape which is generally tapered in the<br>
front part which is housed in correspondence with the cyclist's groin.<br>
The saddles for bicycles of the known described type are realized with different<br>
shapes according to whether the bicycle to which they are applied is a tourism<br>
bicycle or a sports bicycle or racing one.<br>
AH the saddles of the known type have, however, some known drawbacks.<br>
A first drawback is that the seat is fixed in its position and during the pedal<br>
stroke the cyclist's body, especially the thigh and the groin internal areas, carry<br>
out a rubbing against the seat surface. This contributes to make the sitting<br>
comfort worse, especially when the pedal stroke is particularly strong, for<br>
example during a climb cycling.<br>
Another drawback is that the seat comfort degree is rather low because, since<br>
the support area in correspondence with the groin is limited, the specific<br>
pressure is enough to generate a discomfort and sometimes a pain too. This<br>
happens especially during sports competitions in which the sitting on the<br>
saddle is protracted for several hours and the pedal stroke is particularly<br>
powerful<br>
A further drawback is that the structural pattern of the seats does not help the<br>
ventilation in the area in contact with the cyclist's body. This causes an<br>
abundant sweating, especially in correspondence with the groin, bringing<br>
about tumefactions even serious and such that they can prevent the cyclist<br>
from using the bicycle even for a long time.<br>
It is known that there are saddles for bicycles trying to overcome such known<br>
drawbacks,    described   in    the    European    Patents    No.    0.467.541/A1,<br>
0.043.278/A2, 0.091.016/A2.<br>
According to the above-mentioned patents teaching, the seat of the bicycle is<br>
divided in two independent parts, each one being connected to a horizontal<br>
rotating gudgeon coupled to a fixed supporting element connected to the<br>
bicycle frame.<br>
The division of the seat saddle in two independent parts helps the ventilation<br><br>
WO 99/42353	PCT/EP99/01069<br>
and reduces the friction in correspondence with the groin, improving therefore<br>
tangibly the comfort with respect to the saddles of the known type.<br>
Nevertheless it has been found that the seat revolving around an horizontal<br>
axis, whether it is realized in a single part or in two or several independent<br>
parts, does not gives to the cyclist a fixed reaction surface and reduces the<br>
power that the fatter can transmit to the pedals, especially during a climb<br>
cycling.<br>
it has also been found that using saddles with revolving seats following the<br>
buttocks moves, sometimes can cause troubles as traumata or back sprains,<br>
caused by the continuous lifting and lowering of the backbone.<br>
That is why the use of saddles of the type described in the mentioned patents<br>
and generally of saddles having revolving seats is usually not recommended,<br>
particulariy for those people suffering from backbone and back troubles.<br>
Trying to overcome also these drawbacks, the US patent N. 4.512.608<br>
furnishes a saddle in which the seat is divided in two independent parts which<br>
are nevertheless fixed with respect to a supporting element connected to the<br>
bicycle frame and along which they can be adjusted in their position. The two<br>
parts in which the seat is divided are separate by a central element, connected<br>
as well to the same supporting element of the seat.<br>
The saddles of the described type have a fixed seat and therefore do not<br>
cause any articular trouble to the cyclist's back and backbone. But the<br>
presence of the central element in the seat reduces the air circulation in<br>
correspondence with the groin and turns out to be an obstacle for a correct<br>
pedal stroke, especially a sports one.<br>
The European Patent EP 0818214/A2 is also known, describing a saddle In<br>
which the seat has a back part fixed and connected to the frame, from which<br>
two protuberances project forward, parallel and pivoted on the seat fixed part.<br>
Each projecting part supports the lower part of the cyclist's thigh and follows it<br>
during the pedal stroke.<br>
The fixed part of the seat is an effective opposing element for the cyclist's<br>
buttocks and therefore the legs thrust can be totally transmitted to the pedals<br>
while the cyclist's thigh is supported during the move by the swinging of the<br>
forward projecting parts.<br>
The mentioned patent has also a different embodiment in which the seat is<br>
divided in two independent parts, both revolvingly coupled to an horizontal axis<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
and each one consisting in several parts reciprocally hinged, such that they<br>
can follow the cyclisf's leg movement during the pedal stroke.<br>
But both the embodiments described in the mentioned patent have as well<br>
some drawbacks.<br>
In particular the first mentioned embodiment has the drawback that, since the<br>
back part of the seat is  realized in a single  piece,  the ventilation  in<br>
correspondence of the buttocks is limited while the embodiment having, the<br>
seat divided in two independent and revolving parts, presents the same<br>
problems previously mentioned concerning the saddles having revolving seats.<br>
All the saddles without the central element and in which the seat is divided in<br>
two independent parts have also the drawback of furnishing a weak anchorage<br>
to the cyclist's buttocks. The cyclist tends therefore, especially during the thrust<br>
on the pedals, to slide forward. So the efficacy of the pedal stroke and the<br>
stability of the driving position are compromised.<br>
The present invention intends to overcome all the mentioned drawbacks and<br>
limitations.<br>
A first aim is that the saddle of the invention has an anatomically-designed<br>
outline that fitting the cyclist's buttocks outline, it allows the reduction of the<br>
specific pressure.<br>
Another aim of the invention is that of realizing a saddle granting a safer<br>
support to the cyclisfs buttocks during the pedal stroke, with respect to the<br>
saddle of the known type.<br>
A further and not the last aim of the invention is that the saddle of the<br>
invention, during the pedal stroke, does not bring any stress to the cyclist's<br>
backbone.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a saddle for bicycles comprising two separate seats supported by a supporting unit fixed to the bicycle frame and placed substantially symmetrically laterally to the advancement direction of the bicycle, each one of said seats, comprising atleast a first part fixed with respect to said supporting unit and at least a second part, movable with respect to said first part, said second part being revolvingly connected to a gudgeon defining an axis substantially horizontal placed substantially orthogonally to the advancement direction of the bicycle, said first and said second part being covered with a first and second cushions made in soft material, each first cushion having a depression realized in correspondence with the area in which insertion point of the head of the femur of the cyclist's leg is projected in the pelvis, characterized in that each one of said first cushions has a front projection (24) extending with respect to the edge of each first part of the saddle to which said first cushions belong and which is housed in a back projection present in each one of said second cushions.<br><br>
WO 99/42353	PCT/EP99/01069<br>
-  4   -<br>
consists in a column coupled to the bicycle frame, supporting a slide (or the adjustment of the seats position.<br>
The rotation of each movable part around the respective spin axis and with respect to the respective fixed part, is made elastic by the interposition of springs.<br>
Advantageously both the seats have a soft covering with an anatomically-designed shape improving the support and reducing the specific pressure in correspondence with the points of contact.<br>
In particular the anatomically-designed concave shape of the fixed parts covering of the saddle defines a depression in the covering just in correspondence with the area corresponding, on the vertical direction, to the point in which the head of the femur fits in the pelvis. An engagement is therefore obtained, preventing the sliding forward of the cyclist's pelvis, especially during the thrust on the pedals. This helps the transmission to the pedals of all the thrust carried out by the cyclist during the pedal stroke and is therefore particularly useful especially during a climb cycling. Still advantageously the presence of the open area in correspondence with the groin reduces the rubbing and helps a better ventilation. The said aims and advantages will be better underlined during the description of a preferred embodiment of the invention referring to the enclosed drawings where:<br>
- fig. 1 shows the saddle of the invention in a top front perspective view;<br>
- fig. 2 shows the saddle of the invention in a rear perspective view from below;<br>
- figg. 3. 4 and 5 show respectively the front, top and outline view of the saddle<br>
of the invention shown in fig. 1;<br>
- fig. 6 shows the cross section of the respective position of the cyclist's body<br>
with respect to the saddle at the beginning of the strain on the pedals;<br>
- fig. 7 shows the cross section of the respective position of the saddle and of<br>
the cyclist's leg at the end of the strain on the pedals.<br>
As it can be observed in the figg. 1 to 5 the saddle of the invention, marked with 1 as a whole, includes a couple of seats 2, 3 on which the cyclist sits, which are supported by a supporting unit, marked with 4 as a whole connected to the bicycle frame.<br>
The supporting unit 4 includes a slide 5 defining a longitudinal axis 6 coinciding with the advancement direction of the bicycle. Said slide is supported by an<br><br>
WO 99/42353	PCT/EP99/01069<br>
- 5 -<br>
underlying counter-slide 7. the latter being supported by a column 8 connected to the bicycle frame.<br>
The slide 5 is adjusted in its position with respect to the underlying counter-slide 7 making it slide along the longitudinal axis 6 according to the cyclist's needs and locking it in the wanted position through fixing means, for example screws or gudgeons 9.<br>
According to the invention each one of said seats 2, 3 includes at feast a first part 2', 3', fixed with respect to said supporting unit 4, and at least a second part 2", 3", movable with respect to said first part 2", 3", said second part 2", 3" being revolvingly connected to a gudgeon 10, 11 defining an axis 10a, 11a substantially horizontal placed substantially orthogonally to the advancement direction 6 of the bicycle.<br>
In particular each gudgeon 10, 11 is fixed to the slide 5 and supports the first part 2' 3' of each seat 2,3. Said first part is on its turn fixed to the gudgeon. Moreover, as it can be observed in fig. 2, each second part 2", 3" of each seat has revolving supports 12, 13 connecting it in a revolving way to the gudgeon 10, 11 in such a way that said each second part 2", 3" can rotate with respect to the respective first part 2', 3' and around the longitudinal axis 10a, 11a defined by each gudgeon 10,11, according to both the directions shown by the arrows 14,15.<br>
The rotation of the second part 2", 3" of each seat is made elastic through the interposition of elastic means, not represented.<br>
The area 16 separating the seats 2, 3 in correspondence with the slide 6, helps the ventilation and reduces the sweating.<br>
It can be observed in the fig. that each first part 2', 3' and each second part 2", 3" of the saddle are covered respectively by a first cushion 18', 19' and a second cushion 18", 19" realized in soft material, suitable to make the sitting softer and therefore more comfortable.<br>
in particular the first cushion 18', 19', covering each first fixed part 2", 3", has a depression 20, 21 particularly visible in figg. 6 and 7, suitable to house the cyclist's buttocks G,<br>
 The depression 20, 21 is realized just in correspondence of the area in which,  on the saddle, the insertion point of the head of the femur F of the cyclist's leg L Is projected in the pelvis 8. in such a way an engagement is obtained, preventing the sliding forward of the<br><br>
WO 99/42353	PCT/EP99/01069<br>
- 6 -<br>
cyclist's pelvis during the pedal stroke.<br>
Each first cushion 18', 19', as it can be observed in fig. 6, has a front projection<br>
24 extending beyond the front edge 25 of the respective first part 2', 3' of the<br>
saddle supporting it. The front projection 24,  moreover,  is housed  in a<br>
corresponding back recess 26 present in the second cushion 18", 19" covering<br>
each second part 2", 3" of the saddle.<br>
When the cyclist's leg L is in the position that can be observed in fig. 7 during<br>
the phase of the thrust application on the pedals, it carries out on the<br>
projecting part 24 of each first cushion 18', 19' a thrust according to the<br>
direction shown by the arrow 22. Said thrust draws back the projecting part 24<br>
according to the same direction of the arrow 22. Since the first cushion 18', 19'<br>
is fixed to the first part 2', 3' of the saddle preferably through an adhesive and<br>
therefore it cannot be removed, the projecting part 24 draws back and at the<br>
same time lifts causing the swelling 23 widening the initial concavity of the,<br>
depression 20, 21, changing it in the deeper depression 20', 21'.<br>
The cyclist's buttocks G are therefore more embedded in the saddle and the<br>
swelling 23 acts as an obstacle such that it prevents the shifting forward of the<br>
cyclist's body during the application of the highest strain on the pedals.<br>
It is important to underline that the second part 2", 3" of the saddle is not an..<br>
obstacle for the cyclist's leg L during the application of the highest strain on the<br>
pedals. In fact said second part 2", 3", as it can be observed in fig. 7, draws<br>
back during the rotation it, as it can be observed in fig. 7, as far as reaching the<br>
position shown through a hatching, in such a position the second cushion 18",<br>
19" covering the said second part 2", 3" is completely re-entered under the<br>
first part 2', 3' of the saddle.<br>
According to what has been said it can be understood that the saddle of the<br>
invention achieves all the pre-set aims.<br>
In the executive phase the saddle and all the parts forming it can take different<br>
shapes than the shown and described one and the used materials can be of<br>
various types according to the user's needs and according to the features that<br>
the builder wants for the saddle.<br>
Even if the invention has been described referring to the figures shown in the<br>
enclosed drawings, it is clear that it will undergo several modifications and<br>
embodiments, all being a part of the inventive idea expressed in the enclosed<br>
claims.<br><br>
