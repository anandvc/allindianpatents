				<td>INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of<br>
(S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazoliclinone.	(S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-<br>
Qxazolidinone prepared by the process of the present Invention has the formula I given  below and is useful     for the preparation of zolmitriptan.<br><br>
Zolmitriptan is an important drug for the treatment of migraine.<br>
The process involves preparation of the above said compound of the formula I<br>
using novel intermediate of the formula II<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In the literature only two processes are available to prepare (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of the formula (I). In the first route disclosed in WO 9118897 (corresponding to US patent No 5466699), the process for the preparation of compound of formula (I) comprises<br><br><br>
esterification of (S)-4-nitro-phenylalanme to give (S)-methyl-4-nitro  phenyl alanate of the formula (III).<br>
(2)	Reducing the compound of the formula (III)   with   sodiumborohydride to<br>
give (S)-4-nitrophenylalanilol of the formula (IV).<br><br>
(3)	Cydising the  compound of the formula (IV)   using phosgene to give (S)-<br>
4-(4-nitrobenzyl)l,3-oxazolidinone of the formula (V).<br><br>
(4)	Hydrogenating   the compound of the formula (V)   with 5% Pd-C to give<br>
(S)-4- (Aminobenzyl)-l,3-oxazolidinone of the formula (I).<br>
The main draw backs of the process are :<br>
1.	Yield reported in the step No.3 is only 41%.<br>
2.	Process involves use of phosgene which is dangerous and not preferable for using the process on a commercial scale.<br>
3.	Overall yield from step (1) to step (4) is only 17%.<br>
The second route disclosed in [WO 97/06162, WO 97/06163]   which comprises of following steps:<br><br>
a)	Forming a carbamate from methyl-4-nitro-(L)-phenYlatanate HCI<br>
represented by the formula (III) by the reaction of sodium carbonate (or)<br>
sodium hydrogen carbonate and n-butylchloroformate to give methyl (S)-<br>
N-butoxycarbonyl-4-nitrophenyl alanate of the formula (VI).<br><br>
b)	Reduction of the nitro group in the compound of the formula (VI) to give<br>
methyl (S)-N-butoxycarbonyl-4-aminophenylalanate of the formula(VII).<br><br>
c)	Reduction of the methyl ester group (- CO2CH3) in the compound of the<br>
formula (VII) to give (S)-N-butoxycarbonyl-4-aminophenylalaninol of the<br>
formula (VIII).<br><br>
d)	Ring closure of the compound of the formula (VIII) with 30% sodium<br>
methoxide in methanol to give (S)-4-(Aminobenzyl)-l,3-oxazolidinone of<br>
the formula (I).<br>
This process involves relatively more expensive reagent butyl chloro formate in step (a) and step (d) needs extremely dry conditions and involves use of anhydrous sodium methoxide. These critical process parameters are very difficult to maintain  consistently in a process plant, more so while taking scale<br><br>
up on commercial batches. Yields are not mentioned in the patent for any of the stages mentioned. However, we have found that experimentally only 20-25% overall yields are realized.<br>
Considering the importance gained by Zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine for which the compound of the formula I is an important intermediate there is a great need for developing a simple inexpensive and safe method for the commercial scale preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of the formula I<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone (I) which is inexpensive, scalable on a commercial scale , high yielding (40% overall yield) and safe.<br>
According to another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of oxazolidinone of formula (I) by replacing the highly toxic phosgene with simple non-toxic reagents like dialkyi carbonates in the cydization step thereby making the process safe and user friendly .<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of the formula (I)    starting from (S)-4-Nitrophenyl-alaninol of the formula (IV).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of oxazolidinone of the formula (I) by carrying out the aromatic nitro group reduction in the early part of the synthesis there by producing a novel intermediate .<br><br>
Another objective   of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of   the oxazolidinone of the   formula (I) by avoiding an additional step involving formation of a carbamate in the synthesis thereby , reducing the number of steps and improving the overall yields.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the processes disclosed in the above mentioned prior art patents, we aimed our research work to develop a simple and convenient process for the preparation of the oxazolidinone of the formula (I) which can be utilized for the preparation of zolmitriptan of the formula (A).<br><br>
In our sustained research to develop a simple process for the preparation of the oxazolidinone of the formula (I), we observed that a promising approach for developing such a process would be to.<br>
a)	Avoid the usage of phosgene in the ring formation step.<br>
b)	Reduce the nitro group present in   the compound of the formula (IV) with appropriate reducing aaent before the cydisation step.<br><br>
c) Use of dialkylcarbonates like dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate in ring formation step.<br>
Accordingly we focused our research on the above mentioned directions. Following the above directions we are successful to develop an improved process for the preparation of oxazolidinone of the formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, we observed that the ring formation step can be carried out in the presence of an amino group present on benzene ring of compound of the formula (II).<br><br>
We also found further that dialkyi carbonates used in the ring formation step gave better yields than the phosgene method (30-35% higher overall yield).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of the formula (I)<br>
which comprises: <br>
(i)   Preparing   the   4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol   of      the   formula    (IV)    by<br>
conventional    methods, (ii)  Reducing the nitro compound of formula (IV) by hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst in alcoholic solvents under pressure at a temperature in the range of 25-80Â°C, to produce a novel intermediate of<br><br>
the formula (II). (iii) Isolating the reduced product of the formula (II) by filtration of catalyst<br>
and    followed by distillation   of the solvent, (iv) Reacting the compound of formula (II)  obtained with dialkyi carbonate<br>
at    a temperature in the range of 80-200 Â°C. (v)  Isolating the oxazolidinone of the formula (I) by distilling off  the unused<br><br>
dialkyi   carbonate at a temperature below its boiling point and (vi) Recrystallizing  the oxazolidinone of formula (I) from an alcoholic solvent<br><br>
We have described and claimed the novel intermediate of the formula II in a separate application which is being filed simultaneously with this application<br>
The 4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol of formula (IV) in the step (i) may be prepared by following the method described in the US patent No. 5466699. For example 4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol of formula (IV) may be prepared as follows:<br>
Esterification of (S)- 4-nitro phenylalanine with methanol, and thionyl chloride at -10Â°C yields (S)- methyl-4-nitro phenylalanate hydrochloride of the formula (III).<br><br>
Compound of the formula (III) on reduction with sodium borohydride in aqueous ethanol medium yields compound of the formula (IV).<br><br>
The metal catalyst used in step (ii) may be Raney nickel, Palladium/carbon, Platinum/carbon, preferably Raney nickel or 5% palladium on carbon. The amount of catalyst employed may range from 5% to 20% by weight. The reduction step may also be carried out by using metal/acid eg. SnCb/HCI, Fe/HCI and the like.<br>
The alchoholic solvent used may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like.<br>
The solvent used in step (ii) may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc., preferably methanol. The hydrogen pressure used in case of catalytic hydrogenation may be in the range of 20-80 psi preferably in the range of 40-60 psi. The temperature of the hydrogenation may be preferably in the range of 30-40Â°C.<br>
The dialkyi carbonates used in step (iv) may be selected from dimethyl carbonate, diethylcarbonate, diisopropyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, preferably dimethyl or diethylcarbonate. The temperature of the reaction in cydization step of (iv) may be preferably in the range of 90-130Â°C.<br>
