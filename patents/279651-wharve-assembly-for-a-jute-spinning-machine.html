PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a wharve assembly for a jute spinning machine BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A jute spinning machine includes a plurality of wharve assemblies for supporting and driving the flyers disposed over the bobbins of the machine. The wharve assemblies are in turn supported on a flyer rail at the top thereof and aj-e driven by the wharve drive of the machine comprising belts engaged around the wharve assemblies. The bobbins are supported on a spindle rail and are disposed to describe a. reciprocating motion within the flyers. Jute yarn is wound on the bobbins at the desired twist by the flyers rotating around the bobbins. The bobbins reciprocate in the flyers so as to facilitate winding of the yarn along the length thereof. Besides winding the yarn on the bobbins, rotation of the flyers over the bobbins provides the required tension to the yarn. British Patent 490995 describes suspended wharve-driven flyer spindles for machines like jute spinning machines. The flyer spindle is supported for rotation in two rolling element bearings located in a stationary bearing housing. A wharve is formed integrally with the spindle and around the lower part of the bearing housing so as to form a receptacle for oil for the direct lubrication of the lower bearing. Means are provided for feeding oil upwards to the upper bearing as a consequence of rotation of a part rotating with the spindle. US Patent 4796419 describes a bearing assembly for a spinning or twisting spindle. A spindle is disposed for rotation in a pair of bearings located in a bearing housing extending almost along the entire length of the spindle. A port shaped driving wharve is fitted at the lower end of the spindle and it extends over the lower part of the bearing housing in a sleeve shaped way. A separating sleeve and a spacing sleeve are provided over the spindle between the bearings to form flow passages for the lubricant for lubrication of the bearings.   US Patent 4997291 describes a bearing for spindles of spinning or twisting<br>
2<br>
 <br>
machines. A spindle is rotatably held in a bearing housing which contains a collar bearing and a step bearing with a pivot bearing. The spindle is equipped with a driving wharve reaching over the collar bearing. It includes a centering sleeve that accommodates the step bearing. The centering sleeve is surrounded by a damping spiral located in an oil bath. The configurations of the above patents in general require the bearings to be lubricated. This is inconvenient and cumbersome to carry out and increases the maintenance cost. The configurations of the above patents in general also comprise a large number of components and are complicated in construction. They are bulky and heavy and their material cost is high. In the case of the wharve-driven flyer spindle of British Patent 490995 there is a physical contact between the bearing housing and wharve as is seen in Figs 1 and 4 thereof. This will develop frictional forces during rotation of the wharve around the bearing housing. As a result of all this, power consumption by the configurations of the above patents is high and their overall cost is high. Operation of the wharve assembly is also noisy.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a wharve assembly for a jute spinning machine, which assembly is compact and light weight and which assembly is simple in construction and is cost effective.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a wharve assembly for a jute spinning machine which assembly reduces power consumption and noise and does not require re-lubrication.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a wharve assembly for a jute spinning machine, the assembly comprising a spindle the upper part of which is rotatably held in a pair of vertically spaced bearings located in a bearing housing adapted to be fitted on a flyer rail, the upper end of the spindle protruding out of the bearing housing and adapted to be fitted with a cap, the lower part of the spindle protruding down from the bearing housing and formed with a pair of spaced flanges adapted to receive therebetween a belt connected to the wharve drive of the machine, the upper flange abutting against the inner race of the lower bearing mounted on the spindle, the lower end of the spindle being adapted to mount a flyer, the bearings being one time lubricated and sealed bearings.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the lower flange comprises a plurality of fins projecting laterally from the outer surface thereof to form a fan.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with respect to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Figs 1, 2 and 3 are elevation, crossection and exploded view of a wharve assembly according to an embodiment of the invention, respectively; and<br>
Figs 4, 5 and 6 are elevation, crossection and exploded view of a wharve assembly according to another embodiment of the invention, respectively.<br>
The wharve assembly 1 of a jute spinning machine (not shown) as illustrated in Figs 1 to 3 of the accompanying drawings comprises a spindle 2, the upper part 2a of which is rotatably held in a pair of vertically spaced bearings 3a and 3b located in a bearing<br>
4<br>
 <br>
housing 4 comprising an upwardly directed cup portion 4a at the upper end thereof and a downwardly directed cup portion 4b at the lower end thereof. The upper bearing 3a is located in the upwardly directed cup portion 4a and the lower bearing 3b is located in the downwardly located cup portion 4b. The upper end of the spindle protrudes out of the bearing housing and is externally threaded (threading marked 2b). An internally threaded cap (not shown) is tightened at the externally threaded upper end of the spindle to provide a grip for the spindle. The lower part 2c of the spindle protrudes down from the bearing housing and comprises a pair of spaced flanges 6 and 7 adapted to engage therebetween a belt (not shown) connected to the wharve drive (not shown) of the spinning machine. The lower end of the spindle is externally threaded (threading marked 2d) so as to mount a flyer (not shown) in thread engagement therewith. The upper flange 6 abuts against the inner race (not marked) of the lower bearing 3b fitted on the spindle. As the inner races of the bearings are mounted on the spindle the spindle and inner races rotate in unison. The upwardly directed cup portion is externally threaded (threading marked 4c) and is provided with a nut 8 in thread engagement therewith. The wharve assembly is mounted on the flyer rail (not shown) of the spinning machine by engaging the flyer rail in the gap 8a between the bottom of the downwardly directed cup portion and the nut and tightening the nut against the flyer rail. The wharve assembly 9 as illustrated in Figs 4 to 6 of the accompanying drawings comprises a lower flange 7 having a plurality of fins 10 projecting laterally from the outer surface thereof so as to form a fan. During the rotation of the spindle, the finned lower flange also acts as a fan so as to cool the bearings without any motive power.<br>
According to the invention the wharve assembly for driving the spindle comprises a pair of flanges for engaging the drive belt integrally formed with the spindle.   The bearings<br>
5<br>
 <br>
are one time lubricated and sealed bearings and do not require lubrication during use. The wharve assembly comprises fewer number of components and is compact and light weight. The material cost of the wharve assembly is considerably reduced and the entire construction of the wharve assembly is simplified. There is no friction between the bearing housing and rotating spindle. Therefore, development of frictional forces during the rotation of the spindle is eliminated and the noise level is reduced. Power consumption is reduced and the wharve assembly is economical. Further the bearings are kept cooled during rotation of the spindle without any motive power.<br>
Comparative studies were carried out using a typical conventional wharve assembly of British Patent 490995 and typical wharve assembly of the invention in a jute spinning machine comprising 120 wharve assemblies in each spinning frame. The test results were as follows:<br>
