				<td>HEAT RESISTANT SUPER ALLOY AND ITS USE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present irvention relates to a heat resistant super alloy,<br>
particularly on a nickel basis. Such alloys are used in<br>
turbines for s variety of components, but also for other<br>
parts, for example for components of furnaces or appliances<br>
to be installed in furnaces and kilns. The invention relates<br>
also to a special use of this super alloy.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
As mentioned above, a variety of alloys is known for similar<br>
purposes, as nay be seen from U.S. Patent Nos. 3,4 66,171;<br>
4,236,921 or 5,439,640. The alloy MAR 247 LC on the market is<br>
also known and is particularly used in turbine wheels for<br>
achieving higher vibration strength. It consists of eleven<br>
elements, among them a large amount of cobalt, but also relative<br>
large proportions of tantalum and hafnium. This renders<br>
this alloy relative unfavorable as to costs.<br>
In the field of use mentioned above, it will generally be a<br>
high corrosion resistance with respect to hot gases, a high<br>
service life (long-time rupture strength, but also the creep<br>
rupture strength which play an important role for the service<br>
value. In the case of turbine wheels, and particularly in the<br>
case of high-speed turbines of turbochargers, the vibration<br>
strength will add, because the wheels are subjected to high<br>
vibration stress at varying temperatures.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an alloy having<br>
improved vibration stress properties and, if possible, can be<br>
made at reduced costs.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that<br>
the alloy suffices the following conditions:<br>
- carbon 0.01 - 0.2 percent in weight<br>
- chromium 8 - 10 percent in weight<br>
- aluminum 4-6 percent in weight<br>
- titanium 2 - 4 percent in weight<br>
- molybdenum . 1.5 - 2.8 percent in weight<br>
- tungsten 10 - 13.5 percent in weight<br>
- niobium 1.5 - 2.5 percent in weight<br>
- boron 0 
 zircon 0 <zr percent in weight></zr>
- the contents of hafnium and lanthanum together amounts<br>
to 0 
- optionally traces of tantalum,<br>
- the remainder being nickel.<br>
Thus, this alloy does not present any cobalt at all and has<br>
only small proportions of tantalum and hafnium so that it is<br>
more cost saving than up to now. The alloy permits direction<br>
oriented solidification, is resistant against breaking open<br>
the particle size grading during casting, is adapted for a<br>
thin wall thickness and shows, as compared with the prior<br>
art, an improved microstructure of carbide, an improved stability<br>
of carbide and a relative high ductility which is also<br>
particularly important. The traces of tantalum should, in any<br>
case, be below 2 percent in weight, preferably below 1.5 percent<br>
in weight, and more particularly below 1 percent in<br>
weight.<br>
Apart of this, it has an increased modulus of elasticity due<br>
to the relative high proportion of tungsten and molybdenum<br>
which have strong bonding properties with respect to nickel.<br>
Furthermore, the y' solution temperature is increased and,<br>
not at last, it provides also an optimized service life ae to<br>
vibration strength. These proportions of tungsten and molyb-<br>
denum together amount preferably to &gt; 14 percent in weight.<br>
In this alloy, forming of a y' phase Ni3 is due to the proportions<br>
of aluminum and titanium which preferably amount together<br>
to a proportion of &gt; 7 percent in weight. The proportion<br>
of aluminum serves a double purpose, i.e. for forming<br>
the y' phase of nickel, on the one hand, and for obtaining<br>
long-time corrosion protection, because it forms a protective<br>
layer of Al2O3 at the surface that is especially effective at<br>
high temperatures, particularly of the waste gas driving the<br>
turbine of a turbocharger. The elements Ti, Nb and Al are responsible<br>
for precipitation-hardening and intermetallic bonding,<br>
the latter being particularly dense in the alloy according<br>
to the invention. These three elements together, therefore,<br>
should preferably have a greater proportion than 9.5<br>
percent in weight. Thus, precipitation-hardening attains a<br>
higher level of nominal strength so that the matrix of material<br>
has to stand less plastic than elastic thermodynamic vibration<br>
amplitudes, thus achieving higher vibration strength.<br>
It should be emphasized that the general micro-structural effect<br>
of the small Ti-contents provided according to the invention<br>
reduces the formation of eutectic needles (dendrites)<br>
of the y/y' phases as well as the volume proportion in the<br>
eutectic. This., in turn, is significant for the reduction of<br>
intercrystalline failures.<br>
Apart from the protective layer of Al2O3, the combined effect<br>
of the basic elements of the matrix with the element lanthanum<br>
contributes also to corrosion resistance. Of course, intercrystalline<br>
refining is of importance for the desired improved<br>
ductility. To this, the elements B, C, Zr, Hf and La<br>
will contribute. Just hafnium and lanthanum (which, in this<br>
case, has a multiple and synergetic function) attain micro-<br>
alloys which result in an absolute increase of ductility and<br>
the cohesion/adhesion ratio at the grain boundaries of the<br>
matrix. Therefore, is it preferred if the contents of hafnium<br>
and lanthanum together amounts to 0.7 percent in weight in<br>
maximum. Thus, in a particular case, the contents of lanthanum<br>
will amount to at least 0,0035 percent in weight, and<br>
will suitably not exceed 0.015 percent in weight, preferably<br>
0.01 percent in weight in maximum. On the other hand, the<br>
contents of hafnium should amount at least to 0.3 percent in<br>
weight, and advantageously 0.7 percent in weight, preferably<br>
0.6 percent ir weight in maximum. These proportions will<br>
counteract to the tendency of dislocation within the matrix<br>
of material which results in a positive time delay for low-<br>
cycle fatigue and, thus, leads to a significant improvement<br>
of service life.<br>
There are, however, still further (multiple and synergetic)<br>
mechanisms of function in the super alloy according to the<br>
invention. For example, the element hafnium is incorporated<br>
into the y' phase of nickel in the alloy and increases,<br>
therefore, its strength. At the same time, the hot-crackiness<br>
when casting the alloy is reduced by the hafnium proportion,<br>
especially with materials having columnar dendrites (columnar<br>
grain).<br>
The elements B and Zr improve creep resistance, long-time<br>
rupture strength and ductility (to which, thus, several elements<br>
of this alloy will contribute) by intercryetalline cohesion.<br>
Both elements prevent the formation of carbide films<br>
on the grain boundaries. These elements should, however, incorporated<br>
only in traces just enough to saturate the grain<br>
boundaries. Therefore, it is preferred, if the contents of<br>
boron is between 0.01 and 0.035 percent in weight and/or if<br>
the contents of zircon is between 0.02 and 0.06 percent in<br>
weight.<br>
Finally, it should be pointed out that the element niobium<br>
substitutes aluminum in the y' phase, thus increasing the y'<br>
proportion in a desired manner. However, low-cycle fatigue is<br>
strongly influenced by fineness of the y' phase, and it is<br>
the element niobium which counteracts very effectively to<br>
coarsening of the y' phase. In addition, this element, in the<br>
matrix according to the invention, plays also the role of a<br>
mixed crystal former.<br>
In total, it has been found that the alloy according to the<br>
invention, in an environment of up to 900° C, is free of any<br>
formation of a sigma phase. This fact, in conjunction with<br>
the improved low-cycle fatigue, makes the alloy according to<br>
the invention especially adapted for the use fcr turbine<br>
wheels, particularly in turbochargere.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further details of the invention shall be discussed with reference<br>
to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a micro-section of an alloy according to the inventicn<br>
of which<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a detail at an enlarged scale for clarifying<br>
the grain boundaries.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
In Fig. 1, a micro-section of an alloy according to example<br>
1, discussed later in detail, may be seen. The surface of the<br>
alloy, which comprises the layer of Al2O3 protecting against<br>
corrosion, is not visible in this figure. However, it shows<br>
clearly the y' phase of dense, approximately elongated hexagonal<br>
crystallites with a surprising low extend of dislocation<br>
and with a direction oriented solidification which provides<br>
for extremely high strength ana low-cycle fatigue.<br>
Thus, it is stable against breaking open the grain boundaries<br>
when casting, and it is adapted for producing a thin wall<br>
thickness, as is required particularly for the rotor blades<br>
of turbine rotors, particularly of a turbine, that is subjected<br>
to high temperatures, such as in a turbocharger.<br>
Eutectic needles (dendrites) of the y/y' phase cannon be observed<br>
in this figure.<br>
The grain boundaries show margins, which can better be seen<br>
in Fig. 2 (10-fold magnification) , of a layer just of predominantly<br>
titanium, tantalum, hafnium and lanthanum, that<br>
the grain surface is just covered, as may be seen. This has<br>
two important advantages, because on the one hand, the proportion<br>
of the last-named, expensive elements may be very<br>
small, while on the other hand, as has already been mentioned,<br>
the elements hafnium and lanthanum cause an absolute<br>
increase in ductility and of the cohesion/adhesion ratio at<br>
the grain bourdaries of the matrix, where they, optionally<br>
together with the proportion of molybdenum, act like a "lubricant"<br>
of the grain boundaries which permits good ductility,<br>
but in the end contributes also to less fatigue. Thus,<br>
Fig. 2 clarifies why the above-mentioned elerr elements are present<br>
in so small amounts.<br>
The invention will be better understood with reference to the<br>
following examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
An alloy of the following composition (in percent in weight)<br>
has been used, the remainder being nickel:<br>
Thus, this resulted in a nickel proportion of 65.22 percent<br>
in weight. It should be pointed out that this alloy had,<br>
therefore, a total contents of tungsten and molybdenum of 15<br>
percent in weight, and a total concents of aluminum and titanium<br>
of 8 percent in weight, the sum of the contents of titanium,<br>
niobium and aluminum totaling 10 percent in weight. The<br>
contents of hafnium and lanthanum totaled accordingly 0.41<br>
percent in weight, thus being far below the maximum contents<br>
and even below the preferred maximum value of 0.7 percent in<br>
weight.<br>
The thus formed alloy was subsequently subjected to high-<br>
temperature isostatic' pressing at 1200°C and a pressure of<br>
1400 bar durirg four hours. Then, samples were made and<br>
tested in acccrdance with ASTM, Standard E 13 9. During this<br>
test, the samples were subjected to a vibration strength test<br>
at 500°C, at 750°C and at 900°C, and at a frequency of l.s-1<br>
and 5.s-1, i.e. it was a series of 6 tests in total. In all<br>
tests, the improved longer service life hoped for up to<br>
breaking of the sample was attained, the performance in the<br>
domain of fatigue strength being defines as follows:<br>
- Temperature: 500°C, number of vibrations 103 x 103; minimum<br>
oscillation amplitude tension 305 N/mm2;<br>
- Temperature: 750°C, number of vibrations 103 x 103; minimum<br>
oscillation amplitude tension 360 N/mm2<br>
- Temperature: 900°C, number of vibrations 103 x 103; minimum<br>
oscillation amplitude tension 380 N/mm2 .<br>
Corrosion resistance was tested in a hot gas test, and this<br>
showed a micrograph under the scanning electron microscope<br>
having a clear aluminum layer at the surface, which oxidized<br>
to AI2O3, thus providing a corrosion protective layer. This<br>
micrograph inciicated clearly also the saturation of the grain<br>
boundaries by boron and zircon. Neither dendrites had been<br>
formed that are worth mentioning, .nor were there columnar<br>
crystals, and there was a rather uniform grain, as may be de-_<br>
sired (see Fief, l) .<br>
A part of the sample was used to s,aow that an excellent duc-<br>
tility and elasticity was obtained, as is particularly impor-<br>
tant with turbine blades.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A second alloy of the following composition (in percent in<br>
weight) has been used, the remainder being nickel:<br>
This resulted, thus, in a proportion of nickel of 65.1 percent<br>
in weight. It should be pointed out that this alloy had,<br>
therefore, a total contents of hafnium and lanthanum of 0.455<br>
percent in weight, a total contents of tungsten and molybdenum<br>
of 15 percent in weight, and a total contents of aluminum<br>
and titanium of 8 percent in weighs, the sum of the contents<br>
of titanium, niobium and aluminum totaling 9.75 percent in<br>
weight. Thus, no tantalum had been used in this example.<br>
Subsequently, the alloy thus formed was subjected to the same<br>
tests as in example 1 wherein the elasticity was slightly improved<br>
as compared with example 1.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A third alloy of the following composition (in percent in<br>
weight) has been used, the remainder being nickel:<br>
This resulted, thus, in a proportion of nickel of 65.586 percent<br>
in weight. It should be pointed out that this alloy had,<br>
therefore, a total contents of hafnium and lanthanum of 0.604<br>
percent in weight, a total contents of tungsten and molybdenum<br>
of 15 percent in weight, and a total contents of aluminum<br>
and titanium of 8 percent in weight, the sum of the contents<br>
of titanium, niobium and aluminum totaling 10 percent in<br>
weight.<br>
The tests carried as in example 1 showed, slightly increased<br>
ductility. When, however, a long-time test in a corrosive atmosphere<br>
(combustion gas of a gasoline engine at about 900°C)<br>
was carried out, a slightly reduced corrosion resistance was<br>
found as compared to a similar test of the samples of examples<br>
1 and 2.<br>
Example 4:<br>
This example, after the previous good results with alloys of<br>
the examples 2 to 3, served mainly the purpose to be able td<br>
assess the terdency resulting from somewhat more extreme proportions<br>
of the elements. Therefore, an alloy of the following<br>
composition (in percent in weight) was used, the remainder<br>
being nickel:<br>
This resulted, thus, in a proportion of nickel of 67.45 percent<br>
in weight . It should be pointed out that this alloy had,<br>
therefore, a total contents of hafnium and lanthanum of 0.82<br>
percent in weight, a total contents of tungsten and molybdenum<br>
of 12 percent in weight, and a total contents of aluminum<br>
and titanium of 8 percent in weighs, the sum of the contents<br>
of titanium, niobium and aluminum totaling 9.5 percent in<br>
weight. In this example too, one had abstained from using<br>
tantalum.<br>
It should be stated that the samples produced from this alloy<br>
did not lead to any additional improvement as compared with<br>
the results of examples 1 to 3. In spite of the somewhat<br>
higher proportion of hafnium and lanthanum, the ductility was<br>
rather lower which may, possibly, be a consequence of the<br>
higher proportion of C and Cr, but possibly also due to the<br>
lack of tantalum.<br>
Still further examples and tests were carried out to determine<br>
the limiting proportion of the elements of the alloy,<br>
wherein the values were determined which form the subject<br>
matter of the claims and are discussed above.<br>
From the alloys of the above examples, turbine rotors for a<br>
turbocharger vere produced which were then subjected to solution<br>
annealing at 1200°C for 8 hours, and then to precipitation<br>
hardening at 860°C for 16 hours, each time with subsequent<br>
air cooling. All sample rotors were subjected to a<br>
long-time test and stood the tests beyond expectance.<br>
