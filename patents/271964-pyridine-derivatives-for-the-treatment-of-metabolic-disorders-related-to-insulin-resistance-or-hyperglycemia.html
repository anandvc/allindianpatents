CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is related to PCT application no. PCT/IB2007/053817 entitled: METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING COMPOUNDS THAT ACT AS INSULIN-SENSITIZERS filed on September 20, 2007.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful in treating metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Excessive weight, and in extreme cases obesity, is a widespread medical problem. This may be due in part to sedentary life styles and poor diet (high in fats and carbohydrates), as well as to a genetic predisposition in many cases. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macro vascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone that regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid<br>
2<br>
<br>
metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance. Both obesity and Type 2 diabetes are characterized by peripheral tissue insulin resistance.<br>
The prevalence of insulin resistance in glucose intolerant subjects has long been recognized. Reaven et al (American Journal of Medicine, 60, 80, 1976) used a continuous infusion of glucose and insulin (insulin/glucose clamp technique) and oral glucose tolerance tests to demonstrate that insulin resistance existed in a diverse group of nonobese, nonketotic subjects. These subjects ranged from borderline glucose tolerant to overt, fasting hyperglycemia. The diabetic groups in these studies included both insulin dependent (Type 1) and noninsulin dependent (Type 2) subjects.<br>
Coincident with sustained insulin resistance is the more easily determined hyperinsulinemia, which can be measured by accurate determination of circulating plasma insulin concentration in the plasma of subjects. Hyperinsulinemia can be present as a result of insulin resistance, such as is in obese and/or diabetic (Type 2) subjects and/or glucose intolerant subjects, or in Type 1 subjects, as a consequence of overdose of injected insulin compared with normal physiological release of the hormone by the endocrine pancreas.<br>
The independent risk factors such as obesity and hypertension for atherosclerotic diseases are also associated with insulin resistance. Using a combination of insulin/glucose clamps, tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (principally muscle) and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension (Diabetes Care, 14, 173, 1991). In hypertension of the obese, insulin resistance generates hyperinsulinemia, which is recruited as a mechanism to limit further weight gain via thermogenesis, but insulin also increases renal sodium reabsorption and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system in kidneys, heart, and vasculature, creating hypertension.<br>
It is now appreciated that insulin resistance is usually the result of a defect in the insulin receptor signaling system, at a site post binding of insulin to the receptor. Accumulated scientific evidence demonstrating insulin resistance in the major tissues which respond to insulin  (muscle,   liver,  adipose),  strongly  suggests  that  a  defect  in  insulin  signal<br>
3<br>
transduction resides at an early step in this cascade, specifically at tne insulin receptor kinase activity, which appears to be diminished (Diabetaf°gia&gt; 34 (12)&gt; 848-861, 1991). In the recent past, a new class of drugs, which act by reducing peripheral insulin resistance has been developed. These drugs are ligands for the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma isoform (PPAR gdmma), expressed primarily in the adipose tissue. These drugs act as insulin sensitizer's in reducing blood sugar and hyperinsulinemia. The most common side effects of these PPAR gamma activators are weight gain, edema, increased risk of stroke and heart attack<br>
Obesity is a disorder characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the body. Increased incidence of obesity leads to complicationsuch as  hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis and certain forms of cancer. Obesity is commonly identified by increased body weight and body mass index (BMI). People with excess body weight are characterized by peripheral tissue insulin resistance. The term 'insulin resistance' refers to decreased biological response to insulin. In obese individual, insulin resistance is often compensated by an increased secretion of insulin from the pancreas. Obese subjects exhibit hyperinsulinemia, an indirect evidence of peripheral insulin resistance. However, the body can increase insulin secretion only to a certain level. Hence if the insulin resistance continued to worsen in an obese person, eventually the body will no longer be able to compensate by stimulating insulin secretion any further. At this time, the plasma insulin levels tend XO fall which in turn leads to rise in glucose levels thus precipitating Type 2 diabetes. Clearly, this gradual decline in insulin secretion caused by insulin resistance, initiated by excess ^at accumulation, is undesirable for an individual.<br>
Hence, drugs that prevent excess fat accumulation and obesity are desirable. Thus methods and procedures to identify compounds that halt the development of insulin resistance are useful in treating obese individuals. These individuals by virtue of having pharmacological control on insulin resistance will benefit from such treatments in having fewer incidences of heart disease such as elevated blood pressure, abnormal lipid profiles and atherosclerosis.<br>

The term "alkyl," means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated, having from one to eight carbon atoms. Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the like.

8<br>
 <br>
and the substituent, as well as results in a stable compound, which does not readily<br>
undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is meant to include salts of the active<br>
compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the<br>
particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the<br>
present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be<br>
obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the<br>
desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic<br>
amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention<br>
contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting<br>
the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either<br>
neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition<br>
salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric,<br>
carbonic,	monohydrogencarbonic,	phosphoric,	monohydrogenphosphoric,<br>
dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydroiodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, oxalic, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galacturonic acid and the like. Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.<br>
The neutral form of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound can differ from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms and the unsolvated forms are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds, which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that stereocentres exist in compounds of formula (I). Accordingly, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and geometric isomers of formula (I) and includes not only racemic compounds but also the optically active isomers as well. When a compound of formula (I) is desired as a single enantiomer, it may be obtained either by resolution of the final product or by stereospeciflc synthesis from either isomerically pure starting material or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate or a starting material may be effected by conventional techniques. Additionally, in situations wherein tautomers of the compounds of formula (I) are possible, the present invention is intended to include all tautomeric forms of the compounds.<br>

Culture medium containing 0.5 nM l-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX), 0.25 uM dexamethasone, 5 jj.g/ ml insulin (bovine/human), 10 mM HEPES buffer and fetal bovine serum (FBS) 10 % by volume in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was used for differentiation.<br>
3T3 LI fibroblasts were seeded in 24- or 6- well plates at a density of 0.5-2xl04 cells/well and were allowed to reach maximal confluency.<br>
The confluent fibroblasts were exposed to culture medium for 2 days. After this period, fresh culture medium (DMEM) containing only insulin was used, 10 % FBS was added and cultured for 4 days with change of medium every 2 days. After 7 days the cultures received DMEM containing 10 % FBS with no exposure to insulin. By the end of 8-10 days, more than 95 % of the cells have become differentiated into adipocytes. The mature adipocytes were exposed to dexamethasone, 100 nM added in ethanol, in culture medium and incubated for 2 days. On the third day, solution of test compound was added along with 100 nM dexamethasone containing medium for 4 days with a change in medium after every 2 days. Vehicle control contained 1 % v/v of DMSO. Rosiglitazone was used as a standard and was added at a concentration of 0.1 pM in DMSO, along with 100 nM dexamethasone containing medium for 4 days with a change in medium after every 2 days. After a total period of 6 days, the cells were processed for glucose uptake as follows.<br>
The insulin resistant adipocytes were exposed to serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 % bovine serum albumin for 3-4 hours at 37 °C in CO2 atmosphere. The test compound was also present during this period. After 3-4 hours, the medium was aspirated and replaced with Kreb's Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer at pH 7.4 and with human/ porcine insulin, 200 nM. The cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C.

the protocol.<br>
The screening of compounds was based on their ability to reduce the plasma glucose<br>
levels in genetically diabetic db/db BL/6J mice.<br>
Male db/db mice (obtained from the Animal House of Nicholas Piramal Research Centre,<br>
Goregaon, Mumbai, India) were used for this study (body weight in the range of 30-40 g<br>
and age is 6-8 weeks) and were kept eight per cage in individually ventilated cages at<br>
controlled temperature (22 ±1 °C) and humidity (45 ± 5 %). Food and water were<br>
provided ad libitum during their laboratory stay, except for four hours fasting prior to<br>
blood sample collection. 12 hours light and dark cycle was followed during the whole<br>
study period.<br>
After 4 hours fasting blood samples were collected from mice. Mice showing plasma<br>
glucose levels between 300 to 500 mg/dl were divided in groups (8-10 per group) such<br>
that the mean plasma glucose levels and variation within the group, for each group, is<br>
nearly the same. After grouping, mice in respective groups received treatment with 0.5%<br>

CMC vehicle, standard compound or test compounds for 10 days. Rosiglitazone was used as a standard.<br>
After 4 hours fasting, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane (inhalation anesthetic), and blood samples were collected through the retro orbital plexus. Collected blood samples were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C; Separated plasma was used for estimation of plasma glucose using diagnostic kits (Diasys, Germany). Plasma glucose levels of treated groups were normalized with control group using the following formula, which accounted for the changes in control group. Formula used for normalization was<br>
* : {1- (Ratio of mean plasma glucose levels of control group on day 10 to day 0) / (Ratio of plasma glucose levels of treated group on day 10 to day 0)}xl00. The results are summarized in Table 4.<br>
