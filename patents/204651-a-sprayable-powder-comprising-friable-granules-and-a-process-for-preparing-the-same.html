A SPRAYABLE POWDER COMPRISING FRIABLE GRANULES AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
E.I.DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of<br>
1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of<br>
America,	<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a sprayable powder, a sprayable powder of melt processible fluoropolymer and a process for preparing a sprayable powder.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to non-fibrillatable fluoropolymers and more particularly, to sprayable powders thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fluoropolymer resin having properties such as good chemical<br>
] j)     resistance, excellent release, good heat resistance and electrical insulation are desirable in a number of applications. Fluoropolymer powders which are melt-flowable have been found useful in coating cookware articles such as fry pans, sauce pans, rice cookers, grills, and bakeware as well as numerous industrial applications such as fuser rolls or belts for copiers and printers, and chemical processing reactors. One of the advantages for applying powder coatings in lieu of liquid coatings is the absence of volatile organic solvents that present environmental concerns and necessitate expensive remediation procedures.<br>
Canadian patent 1,248,292 (Buckmaster et at.) discloses a conventional process for preparation of the dry powder, in which the aqueous<br>
2{)     polymerization dispersion of the fluoropolymer is chemically treated with a gelling agent while being agitated and then treated with a water immiscible organic liquid (usually a halocarbon). This treatment causes the primary fluoropolymer particles,.generally of average particle size of 0.1 to 0.5 micrometers, to coagulate (agglomerate) into granules generally having an<br>
2(5     average particle size of 200 to 3000 micrometers over a lengthy period of<br>
agitation. This process is generally known as "solvent-aided coagulation". To render the granules essentially non-friable, they are heat-hardened at temperatures close to the melting temperature of the fluoropolymer.<br>
While the resultant granules are valuable for use in such processes as<br>
3|o     rotocasting and rotolining, they are less useful for coating applications. The granules are too large to make uniform coatings. To be useful, the granules are comminuted to smaller particle sizes, which increases cost and tends to fibrillate the heat hardened granules and thereby cause plugging of spraying equipment used for applying the coating. Comminution of non-heat hardened granules produces excessive fines (particles less than 1 micrometer) which have poor handling and coating characteristics.<br>
Another method for producing fluoropolymer powder is disclosed in U.S. patent 3,953,412 (Saito).  This reference discloses that an aqueous<br><br><br>

TT U UW JA389<br><br>
pcriiisflMma<br><br>
dispersion of tetrafluoroethylene polymer is atomized into a gas at a temperature above the melting point of tetrafluoroethylene polymer, whereby the dispersed solids are coalesced and sintered to produce sintered micro-powder with an average particle size of 100 microns or less. Sintered spherical particles of the i     Saito invention are described as useful as lubricants and for molding applications. These nearly spherical particles are suited for processing by rotomolding or casting. But because these particles have been sintered (that is heat hardened at temperatures close to the melting point of the polymer) it is difficult to further tailor the particle size, such as by grinding, to produce particles for certain<br>
1)     spraying applications, as the particles are essentially non-friable.<br>
Attempts have been made to produce blended fiuoropolymer powder coatings with multiple components, such as fiuoropolymer blended with polymer binder discussed in U.S. Patent 5,093,403 (Rau et al). In '403, the particle dimensions of the formulation components are determined by grinding or milling<br>
I       capabilities and limit the composition uniformity of coatings fabricated from the blend. Such blends also exhibit segregation in shipping, processing and recovery of used powder. When using a powder mixture for electrostatic spraying, the components of the mixture tend to segregate. The segregation can produce a variable powder coating composition when the powder is sprayed on a substrate.<br>

There remains a need for a uniform composition of sprayable<br>

components that can be produced, in the absence of a processing step involving halocarbon solvents and/or without the necessity of sintering the particles.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sprayable powder of this invention is prepared by spray drying a liquid dispersion of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer and, optionally, at least one other component, optionally followed by densifying the resultant granules of agglomerated primary particles to obtain friable granules of the fluoropolymer which have a bulk density of at least 20g/100cc and an average particle size of 5<br>
to 100 micrometers.	<br>
By "friable" is meant that the granules can be reduced to a smaller particle size (comminuted) without causing appreciable particle deformation such<br>
l|&gt;     as the formation of fibrils extending from the ground particles. The friable granules of this invention have an irregular particle shape.<br>
For simplicity, the granules are sometimes referred to herein as powder. The granules are friable because the temperature used in the spray drying step is less than the melting temperature of the fluoropolymer, preferably at least 25 degrees C below the melting temperature. If the temperature were above the fluoropolymer melting temperature, the granules would be fused or sintered (that is heat hardened at temperatures close to the melting point of the polymer) and thereby difficult to further tailor the particle size, such as by grinding, to produce particles for certain spraying applications. Therefore, the powders of the present<br>
2^     invention may be characterized as non-sintered powders. The sintering or fusing used in prior art processes produces particles having a spherical shape, whereas the powder granules of the present invention have irregular shapes.<br>
The densifying step carried out sequentially after the spray drying step enhances the ability of the granules to be useful as sprayable powder for some<br>
2$     applications, such as in a light bulb coating application in which only a thin fused fluoropolymer coating, e.g. less than 50 micrometers, is desired. By "densifying" is meant the increase in bulk density of the spray dried powders. For some applications, such as coating light bulbs, densifying is desirable in order to provide a fused thin, bubble-free, continuous coating. In particular, the exterior of<br>
3$     light bulbs are coated with a thin film of melt-flowable fluoropolymer to protect the surroundings from shards of glass should the bulb break, such as can occur in the use of heat lamps to keep cooked food hot in food serving facilities. A fluoropolymer powder is sprayed onto the exterior surface of a bulb, followed by heating the resultant powder coating to fuse it into a continuous, thin, transparent<br>
3$     fluoropolymer coating. In other applications, such as when sprayable powders are used as primer coats or used for coating very small containers or parts, further densifying after spray drying may be not be needed.<br><br><br>

Thus, the present invention provides an advantageous short-cut to sprayable powder of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer, without the need for solvent-aided coagulation as described in Canadian patent 1,248,292, and without heat hardening at temperatures near the melting point of the polymer and subsequent comminution of the heat hardened granules. By eliminating solvent-aided coagulation, there is no need to employ gelling agents and water immiscible liquids including halocarbon, and thus there is also no need for expensive halocarbon recovery schemes to protect the environment. Some comminution of the powder obtained by the present invention, however, may be desirable, e.g. to i
1	articles such as a light bulb and its illumination/heating function. The sprayable<br>
powders of this invention also surprisingly provide the ability to form thicker<br>
coatings with higher builds than conventional sprayable powders.<br>
The product of the present invention can be described as sprayable powder comprising friable granules of agglomerated primary particles of non-fibrillatable 2i i     fluoropolymer and, optionally, at least one other component, the powder having an average particle size of 5jo 100 micrometers, preferably 10 to 80 micrometers, and a bulk density of at least 20g/l00cc, preferably at least 35g/100cc, more preferably at least 55g/100cc and most preferably at least 75g/100cc. In another embodiment, the invention provides for a sprayable powder comprising friable<br>
2	;     granules of agglomerated primary particles of a first non-fibrillatable<br>
fluoropolymer and at least one other non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer component. The sprayable powder of this invention is preferably free of water immiscible liquids, including being free of halocarbon and it is also free of gelling agents. The powder may also be uncomminuted if controlled by the spray 31     drying/densification process to achieve the particle size desired.<br>
By using this invention, sprayable powder of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer having friable granules of agglomerated primary particles of fluoropolymer combined with other components are easily produced. Sprayable powders having multiple components are prepared by adding components such as 35     fillers, pigments and other additives to the liquid dispersion of fluoropolymer and spray drying, with optional steps of densification, heat treatment and comminution as described above. Sprayable powders of this invention formed with multiple components produce more uniformly blended products which components tend<br><br><br>
•We-W/S8389<br>
not to segregate upon application as compared to products formed from dry blending processes or conventional coagulation of multicomponent dispersions (e.g., mechanical coagulation and solvent-aided coagulation). The components of the sprayable powder are intimately enmeshed and the tendency of the components not to separate upon application as a coating is referred to as non-segregatable. The uniformly blended sprayable powder of this invention also tends not to segregate in shipping, processing and recovery of scrap powder and provides a more uniform coating upon electrostatic spraying.<br>
Likewise the sprayable powder may be composed of friable granules<br>
l{&gt;     of a plurality of fluoropolymers wherein additional fluoropolymers are added to the liquid fluoropolymer dispersion or multiple dispersions of different fluoropolymers are mixed prior to spraying. Alternately, multiple feeds of a plurality of fluoropolymer dispersions may be pumped to the drying chamber and spray dried such that friable granules of a plurality of fluoropolymers are formed as the particles agglomerate in the drying chamber. Blends of polymers and components formed by using this invention are more uniform than those formed by conventional mechanical methods of blending powders of individual components after powder formation.<br>
One especially useful blend that may be prepared by using the<br>
2J)     teachings of this invention is a uniform blend of fluoropolymer and high<br>
temperature resistant polymer binder. The sprayable powder formed from this combination of components is useful as a primer layer on metal substrates, priming the surface for the application of additional layers of fluoropolymer coatings.<br>
2f	The present invention also facilitates the step of fusing the powder-<br>
sprayed coating onto the substrate, such as a light bulb, by enabling the melt flow characteristic needed for particular substrates to be customized. For example, commercially available low melt-flow, medium melt-flow and high-melt flow fluoropolymers can be combined as liquid dispersions with application of the<br>
3|&gt;     spray drying/densifying operation of this invention to provide sprayable powder of a plurality of melt-flowable fluoropolymers providing the melt flow desired. In this case, thejgranules of agglomerated primary particles are a mixture of primary particles of different melt-flowable fluoropolymers. The difference between the plurality of fluoropolymers making up the powder can be simply a difference in<br>
3$     melt flow and/or a difference in chemical identity, i.e. different monomers are used to make one of the fluoropolymers.<br>
Sprayable powder of this invention has a characteristic specific surface area (SSA) of from 1 - 6 mVg. As polymerized, raw dispersion particles<br>
-6--7-<br><br>
WDOn/SSIBO	.pCTAJSQg/08361<br>
have an SSA of from 10-12 m2/g. As the particles coalesce, the SSA decreases. The SSA of the sprayable powder of this invention is an indication that upon further processing, such as grinding, the particles will neither melt nor produce undesirable fines. The SSA of conventional heat hardened or sintered particles (those heat hardened at temperatures near the melting point of the polymer), such as those produced according to U.S. patent 3,953,412, is less than 1 m2/g and such particles tend to fibrillate and cause plugging of spraying equipment.<br>
Friability of the inventive granules is best illustrated by Figures 4a and 4b that are scanning electron micrographs showing sprayable powders of the<br>
l|) present invention. The particles appear more porous than conventional heat hardened particles and are more easily densified without producing fibrils or excessive fines. Powders of this invention have less than 10% fines.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, there is schematically shown a system for producing sprayable powders of this invention from liquid dispersion. The liquid dispersion has a total solids content of at least 5 weight %, preferably from 5-70 weight %, more preferably from 10 -50 weight % and most preferably from 15 -45 weight %. Spray drying is accomplished by atomizing liquid feed into a drying chamber breaking the liquid into a multiplicity of droplets by centrifugal effect and subjecting the droplets to stream of heated gas to produce powder<br>
21i     particles. Specifically, in this first embodiment, an aqueous dispersion of primary particles of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer dispersion and, optionally, at least one other component is pumped by a low shear feed pump 1 from feed tank 2 through pipe 3 to rotating centrifugal atomizer 4 (cooled by cooling fan 13) located at the top of the spray dryer chamber 5. Air is supplied to chamber 5 by transporting air through pipe 6 with the aid of supply fan 7 and heating the air by direct fired gas burner 8. The heated air serves as a drying gas creating a hot air envelope 9 in a top fraction (approximately the upper tenth) of chamber 5. The temperature of the heated air introduced into the chamber is in the range of from 840°F (449°C) to 860CF (460°C) and the hot air envelope has an average temperature of 850°F (454<br>
3(j     °C). The aqueous dispersion passes through centrifugal atomizer 4 into the hot air envelope 9 where the water is rapidly vaporized and the primary particles begin to agglomerate ii.to a larger particle size. As the particles descend downwardly through chamber 5, they grow and are exposed to decreasing temperatures moving with a gas stream of evaporating water and air until powder particles exit the chamber where the temperature is in the range of from 220°F (104°C) to 300°F (149°C).  During this process, the particles are not exposed to the high inlet temperature for a period of time sufficient to cause sintering of the polymers. Likewise, the temperatures in the lower portions of the spray-drying apparatus are<br><br><br>
WO 00/5030<br>
insufficient to cause sintering of the polymers in the particles. Powder particles are separated from the gas stream in baghouse 10 and collected in powder container 11. The gas stream of air and water vapor passes through baghouse 10, and is vented to the atmosphere through stack pipe 12 with the aid of exhaust fan 14. Because the sprayable powder of this invention is produced without solvent-aided coagulation of the primary particles as described in Canadian patent 1,248,292 (Buckmaster et a1), the powder particles are free of halocarbon liquid and free of gelling agent.<br>
Alternately, the dispersion of primary particles of non-fibrillatable<br>
l{&gt;     fluoropolymer fed to the drying chamber may include a water miscible organic solvent as the liquid component instead of or in addition to water. Suitable organic solvents include N-methyl pyrrolidone and methyl isobutyl ketone among others.  The organic solvent is not a halocarbon liquid. If an organic solvent is used as the liquid, hot nitrogen gas in the range of 900 to 1000 kg/hr at a feed rate<br>
if     ratio of nitrogen to organic solvent dispersion of about 15-35:1 is introduced into the chamber as a drying gas to create a hot gas envelope having a temperature of from 554°F (290°C) to 572°F (300°C). However, the exposure time of the particles to the high drying gas temperatures is insufficient to cause sintering of the polymers. Powder particles are separated from the gas stream in a baghouse<br>
2j)     as described above. However, the nitrogen gas and the organic solvent are passed through a condenser (not shown) where the solvent is recovered and processed separately and the solvent free nitrogen gas is recovered and recycled in the spray drying system in a closed loop system.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of this invention, powder particles are<br>
2f     further densified after spray drying. Such further densification is desirable if powder particles exiting the spray dryer have a density that is lower than desired for a particular application. One means to accomplish densification is schematically shown in Figure 2. Powder particles that have been formed by the spray drying process described above are placed in feed hopper 20 and are fed by<br>
3[)     horizontal feed screw 21 to a mechanical compaction process. Powder particles pass from horizontal feed screw 21 to vertical feed screw 22 which, with the aid of a vacuum deaeration system, feeds the powder between compaction rollers 23, 24. The deaeration system is illustrated by vacuum pump 25 and suction hose 26 having two receiving sections 27,27a from vertical screw 22. The compaction<br>
3^     rolls are equipped with interlocking grooves or fingers (not shown) which subject the powder to mechanical pressure in the ranges of 650 - 1500 psig (4.5-10.3 MPa), preferably from 1000 - 1100 psig (6.9 - 7.6 MPa) causing the powder to pelletize. Polymer pellets exiting the compaction rolls are subjected to a rotary<br><br><br>
WO 00/3838»	_	VrTf[]rMIQm\  r<br>
cutter blade 28 and passed through sizing mill screen 29 to mechanically separate sprayable powder of non-fibrillatable polymer of friable granules of agglomerated primary particles of a desired size. Depending on the selection of cutter blade and mill screen, the polymer particles may require an additional grinding step to achieve a particle size suitable for particular applications as will be described below.<br>
In another embodiment, the spray drying step and the densifying step are carried out in corresponding zones in gravity communication with one another, wherein the spray dried particles fall into the densifying zone for<br>
1$     densification in a continuous operation as the spray drying is being carried out. A means for accomplishing densification in a continuous operation is illustrated in Fig. 3. Analogous to the system illustrated in Figure 1 with like components designated as primes, non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer dispersion and, optionally, at least one other component, preferably aqueous dispersion, is introduced into<br>
I f     spray dry chamber 5', but prior to exiting the chamber, powder particles are<br>
densified on an integrated internal fluidized bed 30. Densification is carried out by contacting the granules with heated gas to agitate the granules. In this illustration, air which has been heated by air heater 31 is supplied with the aid of supply fan 32 to the fluidized bed 30 through pipe 33. The temperature of the air supplied to the fluidized bed is in the range of from 428°F (220°C) to 563°F (295° C), depending on the melt viscosity of the fluoropolymer and particularly below the melting point of the fluoropolymer so as not to cause sintering of the particles. The heated gas acts to form a fluidized bed of the granules, in which the collision interaction between particles causes the densification and produces friable<br>
2J5     particles of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer and, optionally, at least one other component having a density of at least 50g/100cc for this embodiment. Alternately the fluidized bed may be located external to the spray dry chamber and accomplish densification.<br>
To achieve desired particle size and/or density for a particular<br>
3|o     application, two additional optional steps may be applied to the powder particles. After spray drying and/or densification, the step of heat treatment or the step of comminution or both may be used. Heat treatment is actually a means of further densification.   Conventional tray drying methods using either a forced convection oven or combining forced convection with a hot plate (conduction) dryer are suitable as well as the use of heated gas to form fluidized beds as discussed above. Depending on the particular fluoropolymer, heat treatment is conducted for approximately 5 hours at temperatures of from 300 - 500°F (149 - 260°C), but in any event at times and/or temperatures insufficient to sinter the particles. The<br><br><br>
particles remain friable. Comminution is a means of reducing the particle size if desired and conventional methods of grinding are suitable.<br>
Sprayable powders of this invention may be applied to substrates by conventional electrostatic spraying techniques such as triboelectric spraying or 5     corona spraying.  Surprisingly, the powders of this invention have improved fluidity and are capable of achieving higher film builds on substrates using these standard techniques. Multicomponent powders of this invention do not segregate during electrostatic application thereby providing more uniform coatings on substrates. By this it is meant that the coating produced by spraying the powder of<br>
1)	this invention contains substantially equivalent concentrations of fluoropolymer<br>
component and other components, as compared to the bulk sprayable powder.<br>
The difference in component concentrations between a coating produced by<br>
spraying the powder and the bulk sprayable powder is less than 20 %, relative to<br>
the component concentrations of the sprayable powder, and preferably less than<br>
15     10%. Further, the multicomponent products of this invention which do not adhere to a target substrate during electrostatic application, e.g., the overspray, are also directly recyclable because the components do not segregate during the spraying application.<br>
Sprayable powders of this invention may be used as a single coating, or in<br>
2)	a multilayer fluoropolymer coating system.   Such coatings have application to<br>
cookware articles such as fry pans, sauce pans, rice cookers, grills, and bakeware<br>
as well as to numerous industrial applications such as fuser rolls or belts for<br>
copiers and printers, light bulbs or heating lamps, chemical processing reactors<br>
including, tanks, impellers, pipes, valves and chutes. Sprayable powders of this<br>
2	5     invention also have application in medical devices such as metered dose drug<br>
inhalers.<br>
Fluoropolvmers<br>
Non-fibrillatable fluoropolymers used to make sprayable powders of the present invention include those fluoropolymers which have melt viscosities<br>
3)	within the range of 1 x 102 Pa-s to 1 x 10* Pas determined at temperatures which<br>
are standard for the polymer. By non-fibrillatable is meant that the polymer does<br>
not tend to develop fibrils nor agglomerate when it is subjected to shear forces and<br>
that the polymer cannot be successfully extruded because the green strength is too<br>
low. Melt viscosities are determined by the measurement of melt flow rate in<br>
3	5     accordance with the procedure of ASTM D-1238 modified as set forth in<br>
Canadian patent 1,248,292 and converting the resultant melt flow rate to melt viscosity by the calculation given. The fluoropolymers include those which are melt-processible, as defined in the '292 patent and those which have melt flow but<br><br><br>
WO 00/SSi*9<br>
are not melt processible. An example of melt-flowable but not melt processible fluoropolymer is polytetrafluoroethylene which has the low melt viscosity described above, such low melt viscosity indicating low molecular weight, whereby, melt formed articles of such resin have no strength, i.e. will break upon handling.<br>
Generally, melt-processible fluoropolymer resins useful in this invention have melt viscosity (MV) in the range of 0.5-50 x 103 Pas though viscosities outside this range can be used! More commonly, MV is in the range of 1-40 x 103 Pas. Such fluoropolymers include copolymers of TFE with one or 111     more copolymerizable monomers chosen from perfluoroolefms having 3-8 carbon atoms and perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ethers) (PAVE) in which the linear or branched alkyl group contains 1-5 carbon atoms, with comonomer present in sufficient amount to reduce the melting point substantially below that of PTFE, e.g., to a melting point no greater than 315°C. Preferred perfluoropolymers include<br>
1	'
Preferred comonomers include PAVE in which the alkyl group contains 1-3 carbon atoms, especially 2-3 carbon atoms, i.e. perfluoro(ethyl vinyl ether) (PEVE) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (PPVE). Additional fluoropolymers that can be used include copolymers (ETFE) of ethylene with TFE, optionally<br>
2)	including minor amounts of one or more modifying comonomer such as<br>
perfluorobutyl ethylene (PFBE). Other hydrogen-containing fluoropolymers that<br>
can be used include copolymers (ECTFE) of ethylene and CTFE, and vinylidene<br>
fluoride homopolymers and copolymers.<br>
Useful fluoropolymers also include those commonly known to<br>
2	&gt;     produce micropowders. These fluoropolymers also generally have a melt<br>
viscosity lx 102 Pas to 1 x 10* Pas at 372°C. Melt viscosities are determined by the measurement of melt flow rate in accordance with the procedure of ASTM D-1238 modified as set forth in Canadian patent 1,248,292 and converting the resultant melt flow rate to melt viscosity by the calculation given below.   Such<br>
3)	polymers include but are not limited to those based on the group of polymers<br>
known as tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) polymers. The polymers may be directly<br>
polymerized or based on degradation of higher molecular weight PTFE resins.<br>
TFE polymers include homopolymers of TFE (PTFE) and copolymers of TFE<br>
with such small concentrations of copolymerizable modifying comonomers (
3p     mole percent) that the resins remain non-melt-processible (modified PTFE). The modifying monomer can be, for example, hexafluoropropyiene (HFP), perfluoro(propyl vinyl) ether (PPVE), perfluorobutyl ethylene,<br><br><br>
U&amp;04W3S389<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene, or other monomer that introduces side groups into the molecule.<br>
The PTFE resins of this invention include both those derived from suspension polymerization and from emulsion polymerization. High molecular weight PTFE as used for micropowder is usually subjected to ionizing radiation to reduce molecular weight. This facilitates grinding and enhances friability if the PTFE is produced by the suspension polymerization process, or suppresses fibrillation and enhances deagglomeration if the PTFE is produced by the emulsion polymerization process. It is also possible to polymerize TFE directly to PTFE of suitable viscosity by appropriate control of molecular weight in the emulsion polymerization process such as by the method described in U.S. patent 3,956,000 (Kuhls et al).<br>
Specific examples of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymers that may be used in this invention include perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), low molecular weight polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE), and ethylene/ chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) copolymer.<br>
The fluoropolymer component is generally commercially available as a dispersion of the polymer in water, which is the preferred form for the composition of the invention for ease of application and environmental acceptability. By "dispersion" is meant that the fluoropolymer particles are stably dispersed in the aqueous medium, so that settling of the particles does not occur within the time when the dispersion will be used; this is achieved by the small size of the fluoropolymer particles (also referred to as primary particles), typically on the order of 0.2 micrometers, and the use of surfactant in the aqueous dispersion by the dispersion manufacturer. Such dispersions can be obtained directly by the process known as dispersion polymerization, optionally followed by concentration and/or further addition of surfactant.<br>
Alternatively, the fluoropolymer component may be a fluoropolymer powder such as PTFE micropowder. In which case, typically an organic liquid is used in order to achieve an intimate mixture of fluoropolymer and if desired, high temperature resistant polymer binder. The organic liquid is not a halocarbon liquid. The organic liquid may be chosen because a desired binder dissolves in that particular liquid. If the binder is not dissolved within the liquid, then the binder can be finely divided and be dispersed with the fluoropolymer in the liquid. The resultant composition can comprise fluoropolymer dispersed in organic liquid and polymer binder, either dispersed in the liquid or dissolved in order to achieve the intimate mixture desired. The characteristics of the organic liquid will depend<br><br><br>
We-OOMJIW	PGT7TJSDD7D8351<br>
upon the identity of the polymer binder and whether a solution or dispersion thereof is desired. Examples of such liquids include N-methylpyrrolidone, butyrolactone, high boiling aromatic solvents, alcohols, mixtures thereof, among others. The amount of the organic liquid will depend on the flow characteristics desired for the particular coating operation. Other Components<br>
Sprayable powder of the present invention may contain in addition to fluoropolymer, a high temperature resistant polymer binder. The binder component comprises a polymer that is film-forming upon heating to fusion, is<br>
1 j)     thermally stable, and has a sustained temperature use of at least about 140°C. A binder is well known for use in nonstick finishes for adhering fluoropolymer to substrates and for film-forming. The binder is generally non-fluorine containing and yet adheres to fluoropolymer. Examples of such polymers include one or more: (1) polysulfones, which are amorphous thermoplastic polymers with a<br>
l \     glass transition temperature of about 185°C and a sustained service temperature of about 140°C to 160°C, (2) polyethersulfones (PES), which are amorphous thermoplastic polymers with a glass transition temperature of about 230°C and a sustained temperature service of about 170°C to 190°C, (3) polyphenylene sulfides (PPS), which are partially crystalline polymers with a melting<br>
2|)     temperature of about 280°C and a sustained temperature service of about 200°C to 240°C, (4) polyimides, polyamide imides (PAI), and/or polyamic acid salt which converts to polyamide imide, which imides crosslink upon heating of the coating to fuse it and which have a sustained service temperature in excess of 250°C, among others. All of these polymers are thermally stable and dimensionally<br>
2J5     stable at temperatures within their sustained service range and below, and they are wear resistant. These polymers also adhere well to clean metal surfaces.<br>
In addition to the fluoropolymer, component sprayable powders may contain inorganic fillers, film hardeners, pigments, stabilizers and other additives. Such additives may be added directly to the fluoropolymer dispersion<br>
3J0     prior to spray drying. Or a liquid dispersion of the additive can be mixed with the fluoropolymer dispersion or pumped to the drying chamber as a separate dispersion. Examples of suitable fillers include inorganic oxides, nitrides, borides and carbides of zirconium, tantalum, titanium, tungsten, boron, and aluminum as well as glass flake, glass bead, glass fiber, aluminum or zirconium silicate, mica, metal flake, metal fiber, fine ceramic powders, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, talc, carbon black, etc. and synthetic fibers of polyamides, polyesters, and polyimides.<br><br><br>

Examples 1-8 Preparation of Sprayable Powder from Aqueous Dispersion<br>
Sprayable powder is prepared by feeding, in accordance with the eight<br>
2)	different compositions enumerated in Table 1, aqueous dispersion of<br>
fluoropolymer and as designated additional components to a spray dryer, which is<br>
shown in Fig. 1. For Examples 1-7, the spray dryer used is model 69, available<br>
from APV Americas, Inc., Tonawanda, NY. For Example 8, the spray dryer is a<br>
laboratory model, type PSD-52 also available from APV. The aqueous dispersion<br>
2	5     passes through the centrifugal atomizer at the top of chamber into a hot air<br>
envelope where the dispersion is rapidly vaporized into primary particles that begin to agglomerate and dry during their descent through the chamber. Specific process conditions are listed in Table 1 including air temperature at the inlet to the chamber and at the outlet of the chamber, rotating speed of the atomizer and air<br>
3	0     flow through the chamber. Powder particles having bulk densities in the range of<br>
from 21 -28 g/100cc are separated from a gas stream of water vapor and air in a baghouse and collected for further processing. Characteristics of the spray dried powder for each of the eight compositions are listed in Table 1.<br>
Powder particles for Examples 1-7 from the spray dryer are further 35     densified by mechanical compaction. The particles are fed to a roll compactor, model IR 520 Chilsonator®, supplied by The Fitzpatrick Company, Elmhurst IL as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.  The roll compactor is equipped with a rotary cutter blade which acts to reduce the size of polymer pellets exiting the<br>

Densified powder particles of Examples 1-7 are further reduced in size by grinding in a Air Classifier Mill (ACM 30 or AGM 10 or ACM 2 as noted), available from Hosokawa Micron Powder Systems, Summit, NJ.

3)     mechanically blended polymers. Commercial PFA powder made according to the solvent aided coagulation process of Canadian patent 1,248,292 using PFA-1 dispersion and without the fluorination step is mechanically mixed providing four samples, one sample having 2.5 wt % TiO2,one sample having 8 wt % SiC, one sample having 8 wt % graphite, and one sample having 1 wt % tin. The<br>
35     mechanically blended products are made using large mechanical mixers/tumblers to physically mix the PFA and the added component with the aid of 0.4 wt% fumed silica (added only with TiO2 formulation).<br><br><br>
Powders made according to Example 5-8, as well as the four samples made by mechanically blending are each poured into a 100 ml graduated cylinder up to the 50 ml level. Each sample is then poured  into separate sample jars where 100 ml of water is added to each one. Each sample jar is sealed and each jar is :     shaken vigorously until all the particle clumps are dispersed. Each sample is then poured into separate 250 ml graduated cylinders and allowed to stand. After 10 minutes, the following parameters are observed: (1) the level of separated components and (2) the clearness or cloudiness of the aqueous phase. From this test it is observed that components from the samples prepared from commercial<br>
1)     powders separate into distinct layers. In contrast, the sprayable powders of<br>
Example 5-8 are non-segregatable, i.e., there is little or no separation of the added component (e.g., pigment, filler or stabilizer) from the fluoropolymer component. The pigment, filler, and stabilizer are each respectively encapsulated in (or intimately enmeshed with) the fluoropolymer particles and do not tend to separate.<br>

Examples 9 and 10 - Uniform Spravable Fluoropolvmer Blends<br>
Uniform blends of sprayable fluoropolymer are made and subjected to analysis to quantify the non-segregatable nature of these blends. Example 9 is prepared using procedures similar to those described in Examples 1-7, i.e., spray dried, mechanically compacted and comminuted. Example 9 is a blend is a sprayable fluoropolymer powder of PFA-3 having about 7 wt % A12O3 Example 10 is prepared according to the procedure described for Example 8, i.e., spray dried without further densification and comminution. Example 10 is a sprayable fluoropolymer powder of PFA-3 intimately combined with 5 wt % Al2O3 and 3 wt % mica (also having 1% amino silane based on the weight of the mica). Compositions and specific process conditions for Examples 9 and 10 are listed in Tables 4-6.<br>

The non-segregation of the components of the sprayable fluoropolymer blends produced in Examples 9 and 10 is demonstrated by comparing them to standard mechanically blended polymers. Commercial PFA powder made according to the solvent aided coagulation process of Canadian patent 1,248,292 using PFA- 3 dispersion and without the fluorination step was mechanically mixed providing two samples: one sample having 10 wt % Al2O3 and one sample having 3 wt % A12O3 and 5 wt % mica (also having 1% amino silane based on the weight of the mica).  The mechanically blended products are<br>
lif     made using large mechanical mixers/tumblers to physically mix the PFA and the added components.<br>
Powders made according to Example 9 and 10, as well as the two samples made by mechanically blending are applied to aluminum panels by use of a corona spray gun, model Versa-Spray II, available from Nordson Corp., Amherst, OH, with a spray gun voltage of 40 kV and a powder feed pressure of 15 psig. Powders are applied to smooth clean surfaces at a distance of 12-14 inches (30 -36 cm).<br>
Bulk powder, powder from the panel and overspray powder from the floor are collected and subjected to Compositional Analysis by Thermogravimetry<br>
2(J     (TGA) according to ASTM El 131-98 to determine the inorganic content (amount of filler/pigment) in each sample. All of the fluoropolymer in the powder samples is volatized and only inorganic materials remain. The results are reported in Table 7. The coating on the panel produced by the sprayable powders from Example 9 contains substantially equivalent component concentrations of the fluoropolymer and the added components as the bulk sprayable powder. In this example, the difference in the minor component concentrations between a coating produced by spraying and the bulk sprayable powder for Example 9 is 4 % relative to the minor component concentrations of the sprayable bulk powder. The powder made by the process described in Example 9 is a uniform blend that can be uniformly applied to a target panel. This is in direct contrast to the mechanically blended powders wherein the minor component concentration difference for the dry blended sample is approximately 80 %. Eighty percent of the aluminum oxide present in the dry blended sprayable powder separates from the fluoropolymer and never hits the target panel.<br>
Further, it is observed that the difference in component concentrations between the overspray (as represented by the floor samples) for Example 9 is 7 % relative to the minor component concentrations of the sprayable bulk powder. The overspray powder made by the process described in Example 9 can be directly recycled because the components have not segregated during the<br><br>

WO 00/58389<br>
electrostatic spraying application. This is in direct contrast to the mechanically blended powders wherein the minor component concentration difference between the overspray and the sprayable bulk powder for the dry blended sample is approximately 50 %, and which cannot be directly recycled due to the necessity of reformulating the sprayable powders to their original concentration.<br>
The TGA analysis of Example 10 does not return the fully expected 8 weight %. Approximately 2 weight % of the inorganic is apparently volatized consistently with all samples. This not uncommon. Fluoropolymers decompose to very reactive species such as hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride can react with<br>
H i     inorganic materials, sometimes forming volatile fluorine-containing inorganics. The coating on the panel produced by the sprayable powders from Examples 10 (discounting the consistent 2% loss) contains substantially equivalent component concentrations of the fluoropolymer and the added components as the bulk sprayable powder. In this example, there is essentially no<br>
I:      difference in the minor component concentrations between a coating produced by spraying and the bulk sprayable powder for Example 10 relative to the minor component concentrations of the sprayable bulk powder. The powder made by the process described in Example 10 is a uniform blend that can be uniformly applied to a target panel. This is in direct contrast to the mechanically blended<br>
2i &gt;     powders wherein the minor component concentration difference for the dry<br>
blended sample is approximately 33%. One third of the inorganic oxide in the dry blended sprayable powder separates from the fluoropolymer and never hits the target panel.<br>
Further, it is observed that there is essentially no difference in<br>
2:      component concentrations between the overspray (as represented by the floor sample) for Example 10 relative to the minor component concentrations of the sprayable bulk powder. The overspray powder made by the process described in Example 10 can be directly recycled because the components have not segregated during the electrostatic spraying application. This is in direct contrast to the<br>
3i i     mechanically blended powders wherein the samples undergo a separation related to the charging process, with much of the inorganic components separated. The minor component concentration difference between the overspray and the sprayable bulk powder for the dry blended sample is approximately 66 %. Powders made by dry blending cannot be directly recycled due to the necessity of<br>
35     reformulating the sprayable powders to their original concentration.<br>
The samples are also subjected to the water separation test described for Examples 5 -8. Examples 9 and 10 show little or no separation where the mechanically blended samples separate into distinct layers.<br><br><br>

Example 11 - Powder Application<br>
Sprayable powder of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer made substantially according to the procedure described for Example 2 and having a bulk density of 75g/100cc and an average particle size of 34 micrometers is prepared. The prepared powder is sprayed onto the exterior surface of a series of heat lamps by use of a corona spray gun, model Versa-Spray II, available from Nordson Corp., Amherst, OH, with a spray gun voltage of 62 kV and a powder feed pressure of 15 psig. The lamps are sprayed until electrical repulsion is experienced (i.e., additional coating does pot adhere) and then baked. In some cases lamps were sprayed, baked and subsequently resprayed and baked. Lamps with coating thicknesses ranging from 4.0 -7.5 mils (102-191 micrometers) are produced. Baking is at a temperature of 800°F (425 °C) for from 5.0 to 6.5 minutes to fuse the powder into a continuous, thin, transparent fluoropolymer coating. The coated lamps are then dropped from a height of 5 feet (1.5 meters) to test the coherence of the coating upon lamp shattering. Lamps prepared according to this invention produce a coherent coating that contains shards of broken glass within the coating casing.<br>
When comparing the heat lamp coated with powder of this invention to a lamp coated with commercially prepared fluoropolymer, as described in Canadian patent 1,248,292, the coating of this invention is found to be surprisingly more transparent and thereby more effective in transmitting heat to items such as prepared hot food awaiting serving to/consumption by customers, for example in a restaurant, while still providing a protective coating in case of<br>
—27--26-<br><br>
breakage. Further in application, the powders of this invention have improved fluidity and are capable of achieving higher film builds.<br>
Example 12.13 - Effect of Heat Treatment<br>
Two products of sprayable powder of non-fibrillatable fluoropolymer are prepared, with properties and processing conditions as outlined in Table 8. In Example 12, a fluoropolymer dispersion is spray dried, densified by mechanical compaction and ground substantially as described in Example 2. In Example 13, the same procedure is followed with however, the additional step of heat treating the granular material after the densification step but before grinding. Heat treatment is carried out by placing powder on an oven tray and heating at temperatures of approximately 500°F (260°C) (well below the melting point of the fluoropolymer) for approximately 5 hours. Characteristics for the non-heat treated powder of Example 12 and the heat treated powder of Example 13 are listed in Table 8. Heat treatment provides a means for increasing the density of sprayable powders if so desired for certain applications and for obtaining powders that can be better controlled in the grinding operation to obtain a desired average particle size. The heat treatment however is conducted at temperatures more than 2\&gt;     25 degrees C below the melting temperature so as not to produce particles that are sintered or heat hardened and which would be undesirable in certain spraying operations.<br><br><br>

Examples 14.15 - Preparation of Sprayable Powder from Solvent Dispersion<br>
Sprayable powder is prepared by feeding, in accordance with the two different compositions enumerated in Table 9, a dispersion of fluoropolymer, water miscible organic solvent (including water in Example 15) and, as designated, additional components to a spray dryer, a schematic of which is<br>
ill     shown in Fig. 1, with the exception that hot nitrogen gas is used in place of hot air and that a closed loop system for recycling nitrogen and recovering solvent/water vapor is employed. The solvent dispersion passes through the centrifugal atomizer at the top of chamber into a hot nitrogen gas envelope where the dispersion is rapidly vaporized into primary particles that begin to agglomerate<br>
If     and dry during their descent through the chamber. Specific process conditions are listed in Table 9 including nitrogen gas temperature at the inlet to the chamber and at the outlet of the chamber, rotating speed of the atomizer and nitrogen flow through the chamber. Powder particles having bulk densities in the range of 38 -40g/100cc are separated from a gas stream of solvent vapor and gas in a baghouse<br>
2|)     and collected for further processing. Characteristics of the spray dried powder for each of the two compositions are listed in Table 9. The friable powder particles from the spray dryer do not require further densification, heat treatment nor comminution to be useful as a primer composition for a metal substrate. Example 14 illustrates sprayable fluoropolymer powder that is a uniform blend of<br><br><br>
\y&amp;A0£S389<br>
fluoropolymer component and binder (polyethersulfone). Example 15 illustrates the production of sprayable blue fluoropolymer powder that is a uniform blend of fluoropolymer, blue pigment and binder (polyamide imide).<br>
The sprayable powder of Example 15 is electrostatically applied to 5]     cleaned and grit-blasted carbon steel substrate as a primer layer. A standard fluoropolymer topcoat is applied and the coated substrate is subjected to standard adhesion tests for cookware such as post boiling water adhesion, nail adhesion and cross-hatch tape adhesion. The coated substrate exhibits acceptable adhesion.<br>
