				<td>The present invention relates to novel fungicidal compositions comprising a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative and a sulfamide derivative. The present invention also relates to a method of combating phytopathogenic fungi by applying at a locus infested or liable to be infested such a composition.<br>
European patent application EP-A-1056723 generically discloses the possibility of combining pyridylmethybenzamide derivatives with known fungicidal products to develop a fungicidal activity.<br>
International patent application WO 02/069713 discloses fungicidal mixtures comprising a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative and phosphorous acid or one of its derivatives.<br>
Some of the above mentioned mixtures have shown a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, it is'always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal mixtures showing a synergistic effect in order to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients or to the mixtures of known active ingredients used by the farmer while minimising the doses of chemical products spread in the environment and reducing the cost of the treatment.<br>
We have now found some novel fungicidal compositions which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a composition comprising : a) a pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which:<br>
- R1  may be a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group or an optionally substituted acyl group;<br>
-R2 may be a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group;<br><br>
in which:<br>
- R,1 may be a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group or an<br>
optionally substituted acyl group;<br>
- R2 may be a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group;<br>
- R3 and R4 may be chosen independently from each other as being a halogen<br>
atom, a hydroxyl group, a cyano group, a nitro group,.-SF5, a trialkylsilyl group, an<br>
optionally substituted amino group, an acyl group, or a group E, OE or SE, in which<br>
E may be an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or a heterocyclyl<br>
group each of which may optionally be substituted;<br>
- p represents 0,1, 2, 3 or 4;<br>
- q represents 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4;<br>
and its agriculturally acceptable optical and/or geometric isomers, tautomers and<br>
addition salts with an acid or a base;<br>
and<br>
N-dichlorofluoromethylthio-N'jN'-dimethyl-N-p-tolylsulfamide;<br>
in a (a) / (b) weight ratio of from 0.01 to 10.<br>
N-dichlorofluoromethylthio-N'jN'-dimethyl-N-p-tolylsulfamide is a sulfamide<br>
derivative fungicide also known as tolylfluanid.<br>
In the context of the present invention :<br>
- the term halogen means bromine, chlorine, iodine or fluorine;<br>
- the term alkyl means a linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon group containing<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
- the term alkenyl means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group containing from 2<br>
to 6 carbon atoms and an unsaturation in theÂ¥orm of double bond;<br>
- the term alkynyl means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group containing from 2<br>
to 6 carbon atoms and an unsaturation hi the form of a triple bond;<br>
- the term alkoxy means a linear or branched alkyloxy group containing from to 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms;<br>
- the term acyl means a formyl group or linear or branched alkoxycarbonyl group<br>
containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
- the term cycloalkyl means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing from 3<br>
to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
- the term aryl means a phenyl or naphthyl group;<br>
- the term heterocyclyl means saturated, partially saturated, unsaturated or aromatic<br>
cyclic group containing from 3 to 8 atoms, which may be a carbon atom, a nitrogen<br>
atom, a sulphur atom or an oxygen atom. Examples of such hetercoyclyl may be<br>
pyridyl, pyridinyl, quinolyl, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolinyl;<br>
- the term "optionally substituted " means that the group thus termed may be<br>
substituted with one or more groups which may be halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxyl,<br>
nitro, amin, cyano or acyl.<br>
The composition according to the present invention provides a synergistic<br>
effect. This synergistic effect allows a reduction of the chemical substances spread<br>
into the environment and a reduction of the cost of the fungal treatment.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" is defined<br>
by Colby according to the article entitled "Calculation of the synergistic and<br>
antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations" Weeds, (1967), 15, pages 20-22.<br>
The latter article mentions the formula:<br>
100<br>
in which E represents the expected percentage of inhibition of the disease for the<br>
combination of the two fungicides at defined doses (for example equal to x and y<br>
respectively), x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the disease by the<br>
compound (I) at a defined dose (equal to x), y is the percentage of inhibition<br>
observed for the disease by the compound (II) at a defined dose (equal to y). When<br>
the percentage of inhibition observed for the combination is greater than E, there is a<br>
synergistic effect.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "synergistic effect" also<br>
means the effect defined by application of the Tammes method, "Isoboles, a graphic<br>
representation of synergism in pesticides", Netherlands Journal of Plant Pathology,<br>
70(1964), pages 73-80.<br>
The composition according to the present invention comprises a<br>
pyridylmethylbenzamide derivative of general formula (I).<br>
Preferably, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a<br>

pyridinyl]methyl}-2-methyl-6-nitrobenzamide;<br>
and its agriculturally acceptable possible tautomers and addition salts with an<br>
acid or a base.<br>
The composition according to the present invention comprises at least a<br>

1 :4.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may further comprise an<br>
other additional component such as an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or<br>
filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic,<br>
organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it<br>
easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert<br>
and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid.<br>
Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica,<br>
resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents,<br>
mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be<br>
used.<br>
The composition may also comprise other additional components. In<br>
particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be<br>
an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a<br>
mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid<br>
salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts,<br>
polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty<br>
amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of<br>
sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates),<br>
phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of<br>
polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and<br>
phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential<br>
when the active material and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the<br>
vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be<br>
comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids,<br>
adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering<br>
agents. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid<br>
additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05<br>
to 99% (by weight) of active material, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention can be used in various forms<br>
such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable<br>
powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil,<br>
encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas<br>
(under pressure), gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate,<br>
macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable<br>
concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment,<br>

treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ulv)<br>
liquid, ultra low volume (ulv) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water<br>
dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water<br>
soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be<br>
applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a<br>
spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which<br>
must be diluted before they are applied to the crop.<br>
The fungicidal compositions of the present invention can be used to curatively<br>
or preventively control the phytopathogenic fungi of crops. Thus, according to a further<br>
aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventively or<br>
curatively controlling phytopathogenic fungi of crops characterised in that a fungicidal<br>
composition as hereinbefore defined is applied to the seed, the plant and/or to the fruit<br>
of the plant or to the soil in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.<br>
The composition as used against phytopathogenic fungi of crops comprises an<br>
effective and non-phytotoxic amount of an active material of general formula (I).<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of<br>
composition according to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the<br>
fungi present or liable to appear on the crops, and which does not entail any appreciable<br>
symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide<br>
range depending on the fungus to be combated, the type of crop, the climatic conditions<br>
and the compounds included in the fungicidal composition according to the invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the<br>
capabilities of a person skilled in the art.<br>
The method of treatment according to the present invention is useful to treat<br>
propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or<br>
seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment<br>
can also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the present<br>
invention can also be useful to treat the overground parts of the plant such as trunks,<br>
stems or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits of the concerned plant.<br>

"heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest" essentially means genes which<br>
give the transformed plant new agronomic properties, or genes for improving the<br>
agronomic quality of the transformed plant.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may also be used fore<br>
the preparation of composition useful to curatively or preventively treat human and<br>
animal fungal -diseases such as, for example, mycoses, dermatoses, trichophyton<br>
diseases and candidiases or diseases caused by Aspefgillus spp., for example<br>
Aspergillusfumigatus.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by way of the following<br>
examples.<br>
Example : treatment of vine with a composition according to the invention<br>
This example demonstrates a syriergy for a mixture of 2,6-dichloro-N-{[3-<br>
chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]methyl}benzaniide (compound la) and<br>
tolylfluanid on Vine downy mildew (Plasmopara Viticold) in 72h preventive<br>
application on tomato.<br>
Vine plants (Cabernet -Sauvignon variety) were grown in a sandy soil in<br>
plastic pots with a single plant per pot. At the age of 2 months (6 to 7 leaves<br>
developed), these plants were sprayed with the two fungicides either alone or in a<br>
mixture. Fungicide compounds applied in mixtures were also applied singly at the<br>
same doses as those used in the combinations. The fungicide compounds, either<br>
alone or in mixtures, were applied at a volume rate of 2501 water per ha.<br>
Three weight ratios of the mixture of compound la / tolylfluanid have been<br>
studied : 1/5,1/6.67 and 1/10.<br>
Starting with compound la in the form of suspension concentrate (SC) at<br>
480g/l and tolylfluanid in the form of Water Dispersible Granules (WG) 500g/kg<br>
(Euparene), plant protection mixtures for application corresponding to a volume of<br>
2501 of liquid per ha are prepared.<br>
The dose range of compound la corresponds to 1.56 mg/1, 12.5 mg/1,25 mg/1,<br>
50 mg/1 and 75 mg/1.<br>
Three days after treatment, each plant was inoculated by spraying an aqueous<br>
suspension of sporangia ofPlasmopara viticola obtained from contaminated leaves.<br>
The concentration of sporangia was about 100,000 units per ml.<br>
After contamination the plants were incubated for two days at 18Â°C in a<br>
saturated atmosphere and then for 5 days at about 20Â°C with 90-100% relative<br>
humidity. - ,<br>
Seven days after contamination, symptoms were evaluated in terms of the<br>
extent of the lower surface of the leaves infected, in comparison with untreated but<br>
contaminated plants.<br>
The efficacy of the treatment was calculated using the Abbott formula:<br>
Efficacy = (Untreated - Treated / Untreated ) x 100<br>
The concentrations of the fungicide compounds alone or in a mixture giving<br>
50%, 70% and 90% efficacy for each component were determined based on the<br>
sigmoid curve dose / response model with their confidence intervals.<br>
The analyses of the results were carried out using the TAMMES model<br>
(Isoboles, a graphic representation of synergism in pesticides, Neth.J. Plant Path. 70<br>
(1964): 73-80) or Colby model.<br>
The results obtained are presented in the form of point values, corresponding<br>
to 50%, 70% or 90% control of the pathogen and placed in a Tamnies isobole<br>
diagram which comprises on the x-axis the doses of Compound la expressed in mg/1<br>
and on the y-axis the doses of tolylfluanid also in mg/1.<br>
The calculated results corresponding to ED50, ED70 and ED90 (effective<br>
doses providing 50%, 70% and 90% of disease control) for the various ratios of the<br>
mixtures that have been evaluated are presented in the following Table 1, 2 and 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These results have been calculated on the basis of 3 repeats per factor<br>
according to the Tammes method taking into account the product efficacy for a range<br>
of ratios and for method for 50%, 70% and 90% of disease control on tomato.<br>
This preventive test on tomato late blight shows the synergism of the<br>
fungicide compositions containing compounds A and B at ratios equal to 1/5 ,1/6.67<br>
and 1/10. It has been demonstrated that less amount of both compounds are<br>
necessary to control 50%, 70% and 90% of the disease compared to the theoretical<br>
doses of each compounds expected in the mixture with just additional effect.<br>
A synergy of the above mixture is also demonstrated when data are analysed<br>
according to Colby method. Following Table 4 presents the results obtained based on<br>
using the Colby method for evaluating the synergy of the mixture of compound la<br>
with tolylfluanid according to the invention. Practical efficacy is superior to<br>
theoretical efficacy showing the synergism of the fungicide compositions containing<br>
compounds la and tolylfluanid at ratios equal to 1/5 , 1/6.67 and 1/10.<br>
