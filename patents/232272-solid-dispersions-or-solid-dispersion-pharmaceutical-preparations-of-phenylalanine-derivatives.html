Incidentally, compounds of the formula (l), which are a subject of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are the compounds which have an a 4 integrin inhibiting activity and are useful as agents for treating inflammatory bowel diseases and the hke. Though they can be produced in accordance with the description of Patent Literature 1 and the pubHcation discloses tablets, capsules, and the hke wherein the compound of the formula (l) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are dispensed, there is no disclosure on sohd dispersions or sohd dispersion pharmaceutical preparations therein.   There is no disclosure on solubHized<br><br>
pharmaceutical preparations, either. The compounds of the formula (l) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are poorly-soluble drugs and their solubility or absorbability needs to be improved.<br>
