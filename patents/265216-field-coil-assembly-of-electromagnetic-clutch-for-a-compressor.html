The present invent;ien relates to a field coil assembly of  an  electromagnetic  clutch  tor  a  compressor,  more particularly,   to   a   field   coil   assembly   of   an electromagnetic  clutch  for  a  compressor,  in  which  a terminal electrically connected with a field coil portion, and an electric wire are assembled to each other by means of upper and lower holders, and then finally engaged with together by means of an insert molding, thereby simplifying a manufacturing process to reduce manufacturing expense, removing a need for a separate member for protecting an electric wire,  and easily adjusting the length of the electric wire. [Background Art]<br>
In general, a field coil assembly of an electromagnetic clutch for a compressor is an electric device that transmits a driving force of a pulley rotated by an engine to a disk 4a of a hub 4 engaged with a driving shaft 2 of a compressor 1, by producing a magnetic field by means of electromagnetic induction of an electromagnetic coil at the time of the supply of the electric power, and<br><br><br>
Instantly, it functions cc control the operation of the cooling system of an air conditioning device by regulating the power supplied to the compressor according to the application of the electric power to the electromagnetic coil.<br>
As shown in FXGs. 1 to 4, the field coil assembly of an electromagnetic clutch for a compressor comprises a field coil portion 10a and a sleeve 21, and the field coil portion 10a includes an electromagnetic coil body 11 formed of electromagnetic coils wound into a ring shape, a bobbin 12 formed with a projection 12a to expose a pair of coil lines 11a withdrawn from the electromagnetic coil body 11 and instantly receiving the electromagnetic coil body 11, a core ring 15 for accommodating the bobbin 12 receiving the electromagnetic coil body 11 and inserted into the pulley 3, thereby being secured to the compressor 1, and a cover 13 for tightly closing an open surface of the core ring 15 so that the electromagnetic coil body 11 and the bobbin 12 are not separated from the core ring 15.<br>
Also, a flange 16 is engaged wi th one side of the core ring 15, and the flange 16 is formed with locking portions<br><br><br>
21a is mounted at the inside â– ."if the sleeve 11 in such a manner as to be electrically connected at one end thereof to an end of electric wire 2 0 and connected at the other end thereof to the coil lines Ha so as to cause an external power source to be connected to the electromagnetic coil body 11.<br>
Herein, the sleeve 21 is disposed at one end of the electric wire 20, and a connector 22 is disposed at the other end of the electric wire so that it can be connected to a separate connector 5 for supplying the external electric power therethrough.<br>
In other words, the sleeve 21 and the connector 22 are formed at both ends of the electric wire 20 by molding both ends of the electric wire 20 with resin after injecting the electric wire 2 0 into an injection mold. In this instance, the sleeve 21 is formed by performing the insert-molding of the terminal 21a into one end of the electric wire 20 after it is previously secured.<br>
Thus, the sleeve 21, which is performed of the insert-molding into one end of the electric wire 20, is engaged with the locking portions 16a of the field coil portion 10a. In this instance,  a product is manufactured by finally<br><br><br>
Accordingly, it is possible to produce a magnetic field at the electromagnetic con 1 body 11 by connecting the connector 22 of the electri c wire 2 0 to the separate connector 5 connected to the external power source.<br>
Meanwhile, in the field coil assembly 10 of the electromagnetic clutch, when the supply of the electric power to the electromagnetic coil body 11 is interrupted, surge voltage and reverse electromotive force are generated at the electromagnetic coil body 11, thereby causing bad affects such as occurrence of shortening, and the like to the surrounding other electric and electronic products.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to maintain the voltage at normal state by preventing the generation of the surge voltage and the reverse electromotive force by disposing a diode (not shown) or a register (not shown) at the inside of the sleeve 21 or the connector 22 or at the electric wire 20.<br>
However, conventionally, the electric wire 20 was injected into the injection mold to form the sleeve 21 at one end of the electric wire 20. In this instance, there occurred problems that the electric wire 20 was sometimes<br><br><br>
ratio due to the injection lizr rrler, ai:ci r.he li^e.<br>
Moreover, there cccurreci a problem that raanufacuuring expense such as material expense, or labor expense, and rhe like was increased, because a separate member such as contraction tube, and the like should be additionally assembled to an outer shell of the electric wire 20 to protect the electric wire 20.<br>
Furthermore, since both ends of the electric wire 20 should be performed of the injection-molding instantly with the sleeve 21 and the connector 22, it was difficult to adjust the length of the electric wire 20. In other words, conventionally, there also occurred a problem that a separate accommodating structure should be formed in the injection molding according to the length of the electric wire 20 to adjust the length of the electric wire 20.<br>

electromagnetic coil b,:cly 11, a coa"c ring 15 f ol~ accommodating the bobbin 12 receiving the electromagnetic coil body 11 and inserted inre the pulley 3, thereby being secured to the compressor 1, and a cover 13 for tightly closing an open surface of the core ring 15 so that the electromagnetic coil body 11 and the bobbin 12 are not separated from the core ring 15.<br>
Also, the core ring 15 is provided with a flange 16 at one side for engagement with the compressor 1, and the flange 16 is formed with locking portions 16a at both sides of a pair of coil lines 11a so that they protrude.<br>
In addition, the sleeve 110 is engaged with the locking portions 16a and a terminal 141 is mounted at the inside of the sleeve 110 in such a manner as to be connected at one end thereof to an end of electric wire 140 and connected at the other end thereof to the coil lines 11a so as to cause an external power source to be connected to the e 1 ectrornagnetic coil body 11.<br>
Herein, the electric wire 140 is formed at the other end thereof with a connector 142 connected to the separate connector 5 for supplying the external electric power.<br><br><br>
electrically connect the terminal 141 nc: the coil lines 11a, and the connector 142 which is provided at che other end of the electric wire 140 is electrically connected to the separate connector 5 connected to the external power source, so that the electric power is supplied to the electromagnetic coil body 11 to produce a magnetic field . Thus, it is possible to control the operation of the cooling system of the air conditioning device by regulating the power supplied to the compressor 1 according to the application of the electri c power to the electromagnetic coil body 11.<br>
Hereinafter, the sleeve 110, which is the characteristic of the present invention, will be described in detail.<br>
The sleeve 110 is engaged with the locking portions 16a by means of a first engagement means 121, and comprises a lower holder 120 provided with the terminal 141 connected to one end of the electric wire 140 at an upper side, and an upper holder 13 0 engaged at the upper side of the lower holder 120 by means of a second engagement means 124 for securing one end of the terminal 141 and the electric wire<br><br><br>
sleeve 110 is designed as an assembly type by being constructed of the lower holder 120 and the upper holder 130, which can be assembled to each other.<br>
As described above, each first engagement means 121 is formed with an engagement portion 122 extending outwardly from one side of the lower holder 120, at which time, first engagement means is formed with a retaining step 123 at the distal end thereof, so that the retaining step can be securely caught by the locking portion 16a while the retaining step is inserted below the locking portion 16a.<br>
Here, the pair of engagement portions 122 are separated from each other by a predetermined interval, and it is preferable that the separated distance is longer than the length of a projection 12a formed at the bobbin 12.<br>
Accordingly, when the engagement portions 122 of the lower holder 120 are inserted below the locking portions 16a disposed at both sides of the coil lines 11a, the retaining steps 123 formed at the distal ends of the engagement portions 122 are firmly caught by the locking portions 16a so that the lower holder 12 0 is securely<br>
11:<br><br><br>
that both sides of the uppei helper 13 C :au be securely caught by the- pair of hecks.<br>
In addition, the lower holder 120 is formed with a projecting guide 126 to prevent the movement at the time of assembling the lower holder 120 with the upper holder 130, and the upper holder 130 is formed with an insertion groove 131 so that the guide 126 can be inserted into it.<br>
Accordingly, when the upper holder 130 is assembled to the lower holder 120, as it is assembled with the insertion of the guide 126 into the insertion groove 131, they can be easily assembled as they cannot be moved, and the upper holder 130 cannot be separated from the lower holder 120 because it is caught by the hook 125 formed at the lower holder 120 after the completion of the assembly. Moreover, when the assembly is completed due to the caught of the upper holder 13 0 by the hook 125 of the lower holder 120, one side of the upper holder 130 presses and secures the upper side of the terminal 141, and the other side of the upper holder presses and secures the upper side of the end of the electric wire 140.<br>
In this  instance,  it  is preferable  that  the upper holder 130 is formed with a space portion 132 at the center<br><br><br>
connection portion I41a cponou in che direct! --v. :.f the ;;â– ; il lines 1 la at one end there; f so chat io is connected to a pair of coil lines 11a, and is formed wi t.h a U-shaped connection portion 141b opened in the upward direction at the other end thereof so that it can be connected to an end of the electric wire 140.<br>
Also, the terminal 141 is engaged by insertion into a projection 127 formed at the lower holder 120 so that it is not moved when it is disposed at the upper side of the lower holder 120.<br>
Then, after the assembly of the terminal 141 and the electric wire 140 by means of the upper and lower holders 130, 120, the sleeve 110 is engaged with the locking portions 16a of the field coil portion 10a, and then the upper side of the sleeve 110 is finally insert-molded with resin 150.<br>
Thus, since the sleeve 110 is molded with the sleeve engaged with the locking portions 16a, an outer appearance of the sleeve 110 becomes graceful and the ends of the coil lines 11a, the terminal 141 and the electric wire 140 which are electrically interconnected are not exposed to zhe<br><br><br>
register (net shown) at the inside of the sleeve 110 or the connector 142, or at the electric wire 140 to prevent the surge voltage and the reverse electromotive force, thereby maintaining the voltage at normal state. Herein, as the technology of disposing the diode and the register has been well known, detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
As described above, the field coil assembly 100 of the electromagnetic clutch for the compressor according to the present invention is constructed that the terminal 141 and the electric wire 140 are disposed on the upper side of the lower holder 120 at the connection state. As a result, the terminal 141 is inserted into the projection 127 formed at the lower holder 120 so that it is prevented from moving at this time.<br>
Then, the upper holder 13 0 is assembled to the lower holder 120. In this instance, both sides of the upper holder 130 are caught by the hook 125 formed at the lower holder 12 0, so that the upper holder is secured to the lower holder.<br>
Thus,  the sleeve 110,  which is constructed of the<br><br>
4<br><br>
port.ion 10a. In other v;ords, the engagement portions 12 2 of the lower holder 120 =tre inseitcd helov the 1c eking portions 16a so that the retaining steps 123 of the engagement portions 122 is caught by the locking portions 16a, thereby securely engaging the sleeve 110 with the locking portions 16a.<br>
Then, a product is manufactured by finally being insert-molded of the upper side of the sleeve 110 in the injection mold with resin after the sleeve 110 is engaged with the locking portions 16a.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, manufacturing can be  facilitated and the manufacturing expense can be reduced by constructing the sleeve 110 provided at  one  end of  the electric wire  140  to be assembled by means of the upper and lower holders 130, 120, instead of making it by means of the conventional insert-molding. Also, it is possible to adjust the length of the electric wire 140 according to its requirement,  as the sleeve 110 is assembled to one end of the electric wire 140. [industrial Applicability]<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, as the sleeve is constructed by assembling the terminal and<br><br><br>
melding,  it  is  possible  to  simplify  the manufacturing process and reduce che manufacturing expense.<br>
Also. as the sleeve is cons r. rue ted tc be assembled by means of the upper and lower holders instead of performing the insert-molding at the inside of the injection mold, it is easy to manufacture the sleeve, a separate member is not required to protect the electric wire, and it becomes easy to adjust the length of the electric wire.<br><br><br>
