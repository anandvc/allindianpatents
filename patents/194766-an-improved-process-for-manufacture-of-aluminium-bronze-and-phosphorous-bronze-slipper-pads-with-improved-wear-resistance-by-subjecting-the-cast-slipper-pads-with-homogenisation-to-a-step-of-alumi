				<td>The present invention relates to the process for manufacture of wear-resistant Aluminium-Bronze/Phosphorous-Bronze slipper pads with improved wear resistance and in particular to manufacture of aluminium ennched Aluminium-Bronze/Phosphorous-Bronze slipper pads through diffusion annealing and heat treatment<br>
It is presently known to have Aluminium-Bronze (containing 9-11% Al, 1.5-4% Fe and 0 35 Mn and balance Cu) and Phosphorous-Bronze (containing Sn 12%, P 0 50% and balance Cu) slipper pads used extensively in the slabbing mills and hot strip mills of various steel plants<br>
It is found that the average life of the above mentioned slipper pads in roughing stands is usually 2-4 months and for finishing stands only about 3-4 weeks Since, the average wear life of these slipper pads is low, it results in increase in the mill downtime which adversely affected the productivity of the mill<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for an improved process of manufacture of Aluminium-Bronze/Phosphorous Bronze, slipper pads which would improve hardness and wear-resistance as well as achieve smoother lubrication<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for an improved process of manufacture of aluminium ennched aluminium-bronze/phosphorous-bronze slipper pads which would have extensive and extended life as compared to the conventional slipper pads presently available<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to the improvement in manufacture of aluminium-bronze/phosphorous-bronze slipper pads treatment cycle, involving optimum heat to improve the hardness and hence the wear resistance of such aluminium-bronze/phosphorous bronze alloys.<br>
Yet further object is directed to the provision of aluminium-bronze/phosphorous-bronze slipper pads by way of a simple and cost effective process of manufacture<br><br>
2<br>
which would provide for increasing the productivity and economise the operation<br>
of mills	 <br><br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided an improved process <br><br>
for manufacture of aluminium-bronze and phosphorous-bronze slipper pads with <br><br>
improved wear-resistance comprising the steps of diffusion metallisation of homogenised aluminium-bronze/phosphorous-bronze slipper pads with aluminium to obtain aluminium enriched aluminium-bronze and/or phosphorous bronze slipper pads, heat treatment of the aluminium enriched aluminium-bronze and/or phosphorous-bronze slipper pads at a temperature in the range of 820 to 840°C for a period of 0 5 to 1 hr and tempering the slipper pads in the temperature of range of 250 to 350°C for a period of 2 to 3 hrs to thereby obtain the aluminium bronze and/or phosphorous bronze slipper pads with improved wear resistance<br>
In accordance with embodiment preferably prior to said step of aluminium enrichment and heat treatment the cast slippers are subjected to a step of homogenisation comprising subjecting the cast slipper pads to heating at a temperature of 730° to 750°C and soaking for a period of 0 5 to 1 5 hrs<br>
In particular in the above process said step of treatment for enrichment by<br>
diffusion of aluminium comprise<br>
providing an Al-containing pulverulent mixture in a box/container,<br>
providing said cast slipper pads in said box and covering with said pulverulent<br>
mixture ,<br>
heating the said slipper pads covered with said pulverulent mixture in said boxes<br>
by soaking at temperature of 820°C to 840°C for a period of 5 to 7 hrs<br>
The aluminium-bronze slipper pads used preferably comprise 9-11% Al, 1 44% Fe, 0 35 Mn and rest Cu while the phosphorous-bronze slipper pads comprise Sn 12%, P 0 50% and balance Cu<br><br>
3<br>
The said containers/boxes used are preferably fabricated to accommodate at [east two slipper pads at a time kept vertically<br>
The pulverised mixture comprise a selective mix of Al powder 100-150 kq, AI2O3<br>
powder 60-80 kg and NH4CI powder 2-5 kg	<br><br><br>
4<br>
In the above process the above pulverulent mixture are first thoroughly intermixed and slipper pads kept in said box/container are covered by this mixture and maintained soaked for a period of 5 to 7 hrs. at a temperature of 820 to 840°C in the furnace After the step of soaking of the slipper pads, the same is taken out of the furnace and subjected to air cooling.<br>
Preferably after the said step of diffusion metalization of the bronzes, the aluminium enriched bronzes are hardened by heat treatment to further increase the hardness of the slipper pads. The said step of hardening comprises heating in the temperature of 820 to 840°C preferably for a period of 0 5 to 1.5 hrs After said step of hardening the slipper pads are water quenched Subsequent to said hardening treatment, the thus hardened slipper pads are subjected to tempering and for the purpose are heated in a temperature in the range of 250 to 350°C for a period of 2 00 to 3 00 hours and finally, air cooled<br>
The details of the invention, is objects and advantages are explained hereunder<br>
in greater detail in relation to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment and accompanying drawings biscussed <br>
hereunder <br>
EXAMPLES<br>
I	Homogenisation<br>
Al-bronze slipper pads containing 9 to 11% Al, 1 5 to 4% Fe, 0 35% Mn and rest Cu were homogenised first by heating to 740°C, soaking them for 1 hr at that temperature, followed by air cooling It resulted in the increase of the hardness from 54-91 BHN (in the cast pads) to 80-103 BHN (in the case of the homogenised slipper pads).<br>
II	Diffusion Metallising<br>
For the purpose the following were carned out A Fabrication of box<br>
A box of appropriate dimensions was made so as to accommodate two<br>
slipper pads at a time, kept vertically as shown in Figs 1 &amp; 2<br><br>
B Aluminising mixtures<br>
An adequate composition of the mixture required for aluminising slipper pads was evolved after a lot of laboratory scale experiments The same is given below<br>
• Al powder 100-150 kg<br>
• AI2O3 powder 60-80 kg<br>
• NH4CI powder 2-5 kg<br>
Temperature and soaking time<br>
The above pulverulent mixture ingredients were thoroughly intermixed and the two slipper pads were covered all around by this mixture in the packing boxes which were soaked for 6 hours at a temperature of 830°C in the furnace<br>
III Heat Treatment of Al Bronze<br>
A detailed investigation revealed that if the slipper pads are next heat-treated adequately, the hardness and wear resistance is improved significantly The detailed of heat treatment are given below I) Hardening<br>
The slipper pads were hardened to 830°C, soaked for 1 hour and<br>
then water quenched II) Tempering<br>
The hardened slipper pads were heated to 300°C, kept at this<br>
temperature for 2 5 hours and then air cooled<br>
The reaction scheme in the above discussed process of Al enrichment of the slipper pad is as detailed hereunder.<br>
a On heating of the pulverised mix the aluminium chloride decomposes into<br>
ammonia and hydrogen chloride ,<br>
NH4CI	NH3 + HCI<br><br>
b. The evolved gas displaces the air from the container and in reacting with<br>
aluminium, the hydrogen chloride forms aluminium chloride, AI2CI3 in a<br>
gaseous state,<br>
6HCI + 2AI	2AICI3 + 3H2<br>
c At the surface layer of bronzes, an exchange reaction of following type takes<br>
place,<br>
3Cu + 2AICI3	3CuCI2 + 2AI<br>
Thus aluminium precipitated on the surface enters the Al or P bronzes and diffuses inwardly As the time of soaking ts increased, the amount of Al, entering the surface is increased.<br>
The base AI2O3 is needed to prevent the aluminium powder from fusing into a liquid mass. Only separate particles of molten aluminium surround the particles of base AI2O3 and thus the porosity of the mixture remains unchanged or preserved<br>
The values of range of hardness of as cast slipper pads, after homogenisation, metalisation and heat treatment are given in Fig 3 It is observed that the hardness of cast slipper pads (54-91) increases to 130-132 after aluminising ft further increases to 176-195 BHN after heat treatment which has been described in earlier Section<br>
Fig 4 illustrates the microstructure of hardened (830°C) water quenched and tempered (300°C) Al-bronze slipper pads, a (white) and (3 (black) constituents can be observed<br>
In Fig 5 starting of the aluminising process can be observed at the surface of the sample after soaking for one hour at 830°C The core matrix is a + ß with diffusion of Al has started The microstructure of Al-bronze after metalisation at 830°C for 3 hours is shown in Fig 6 This shows the increase in depth of ennchment of aluminium at the surface<br><br>
7<br>
After 830°C and 6 hrs soaking the diffusion of aluminium in the bronze sample was adequate and can be seen in Fig. 7 Thus it may be said that a soaking temperature of 830°C of a duration of 6 hrs was found to be optimum<br>
The thus obtained Al enriched slipper pads followed by heat treatment (hardening 830°C/tempenng 300°C) were fitted in finishing stands of Hot Strip Mill, along with conventional slipper pads and industrially tried in identical conditions It was found that wear in new experimental slipper pads was 2 to 3 times less than that in conventional ones<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to have<br>
I) a new pulverulent mixture for aluminising Al &amp; P bronze slipper pads ;<br>
II) an improved process for development of ennchment of aluminium process,<br>
which increased the hardness of as cast phosphorous-bronze slipper pads<br>
from 54-91 to 130-132 BHN. Hardness of aluminium-bronze slipper pads<br>
after heat treatment increased to 178-195 BHN , III) increasing the percentage of aluminium to about 30% in the surface of<br>
slipper pads to thereby improve hardness; iv) evolution of an optimum heat treatment cycle, after a series of laboratory<br>
tnals to improve the hardness &amp; hence the wear resistance<br>
The invention thus clearly provides a process technology to increase the hardness and hence improved wear-resistance of aluminium-bronze and phosphorous-bronze slipper pads thereby improving upon the utilities and cost effectiveness in the use of such slipper pads,<br><br>
