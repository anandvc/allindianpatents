COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FUNCTIONAL WATER<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office <br>
at  Hindustan  Lever  House,     165/166,  Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   1   -<br>
FUNCTIONAL WATER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
5<br>
The present invention is directed to functional water. More particularly, the invention is directed to functional water comprising less than about 200 ppm total dissolved solids. The functional water of the present invention, when used to make a<br>
10  	tea-based beverage, unexpectedly results in a beverage having superior flavor and appearance characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
Tea-based beverages are some of the most popular beverages with consumers. In fact, many studies indicate that tea-based beverages promote good health. For example, studies indicate that both green and black tea, which are derived from Camellia<br>
20  sinensis,   comprise cancer fighting antioxidants.<br>
Other studies indicate that people who drink one or more cups of tea per day may have half the heart attack risk than people who drink no tea. <br>
25<br>
Notwithstanding the advantages of drinking a tea-based beverage, it is not always routine to generate a consistent beverage. Particularly, the water used to make a desired tea-based beverage can have a significant impact on, among other <br>
30   things, the taste and appearance of the beverage.<br>
When levels of certain ions within the Water used to generate the tea-based beverage are too high or too low, the<br>
resulting beverage often tastes and looks inferior. For example,<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   2   -<br>
tea-based beverages made with reverse osmosis water can be bitter, sour, flat and metallic tasting. Moreover, such tea-based beverages made with conventional tap water can be weak tasting, lacking in astringency, cloudy and have hazy<br>
5  	precipitates suspended therein.<br>
It is of increasing interest to develop a means for generating a consistent tea-based beverage. This invention, therefore, is directed to functional water whereby the water<br>
10  comprises less than 200 ppm total dissolved solids.  The<br>
functional water of the present invention unexpectedly can be used to make a consistent tea-based beverage with superior flavor and appearance characteristics.  Particularly, the tea-based beverage made with the functional water of the present invention,<br>
15  surprisingly, has characteristics similar to that of beverages made with spring water which typically can have at least 35% by weight less dissolved solids than the functional water of this invention.<br>
20<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to 10  	functional water comprising:<br>
	(a)  less than about 200 ppm of total dissolved solids<br>
  and more total dissolved solids than reverse<br>
  osmosis water; and<br>
15	(b)  less than about 50 ppm bicarbonate<br>
wherein the functional water has a pH from about 7.0 to less than about 8.5.<br>
20      In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for making a tea-based beverage comprising the functional water of the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention is directed to a <br>
25  	tea-based beverage comprising the functional water of the first aspect of this invention.<br>
Tea based beverage, as use herein, is defined to mean any beverage that comprises a component derived from Camellia <br>
30 	sinensis.     Total dissolved solids means the total amount of<br>
solids that can be recovered in dry form when water is evaporated off of the functional water of this invention.  Ions are defined to mean electrically charged (e.g., monovalent or divalent) atoms<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   4   -<br>
or radicals generated from the total dissolved solids in the functional water of this invention and selected from the group consisting of magnesium, calcium, sulfate, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, fluoride and chloride ions. Reverse osmosis water<br>
5  	means pure H20 and comprising no ions.  Superior flavor, as used herein, means a taste grade of at least good as determined by a trained flavor panel. Superior appearance characteristics means having a Hunter Haze Value from about 15 to about 50 as<br>
determined with a Hunterlab DP-9000 Spectrophotometer at about <br>
10  	ambient temperature in a 5 cm cell.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The only limitation with respect to the method of<br>
15   generating the functional water of the present invention is that the method employed results in water having less than about 200 ppm total dissolved solids, more dissolved solids than reverse osmosis water and less than about 50 ppm bicarbonate. Such a method can be one where dry solids are added to precursor tap<br>
20   water, spring water or reverse osmosis water to generate the functional water of the present invention. Other methods can include filtration systems that have a non-functional (e.g., tap) water input and may be designed to deliver or output the functional water described. Often, the functional water of the<br>
25   present invention comprises from about 0 to about 95 ppm ions<br>
which are divalent and from about 50 to less than about 200 ppm ions which are monovalent, and preferably, from about 5 to about 80 ppm ions which are divalent and from about 50 to about 175 ppm ions which are monovalent, and most preferably, from about 10 to<br>
30   about 65 ppm ions which are divalent and from about 50 to about<br>
155 ppm ions which are monovalent, including all ranges subsumed therein.  In another preferred embodiment, the functional water of the present invention comprises from about 0 to less than<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   5   -<br>
about 50 ppm bicarbonate, and most preferably, from about 0.001 to about 10 ppm bicarbonate, including all ranges subsumed<br>
therein.<br>
5      Regarding the tea-based beverage made with the functional water of this invention, such a beverage may be made from tea leaves, tea powders, tea concentrates or a combination thereof, and preferably, the tea leaves, powders and concentrates made commercially available by Unilever Best foods under the Lipton<br>
10  	Brand. When tea leaves are employed, the tea-based beverage, for example, is made by pouring, dripping or spraying the functional water of this invention over the tea leaves in a sachet (e.g., bag) or over the tea leaves loose within filter paper. The process for making the tea-based beverage from tea leaves can be<br>
15  on a cup-by-cup basis or via a large batch basis which employs a conventional tea brewing apparatus. A preferred apparatus suitable to utilize the functional water of this invention to brew a superior tea-based beverage from leaf tea has been designed by Unilever Best foods under the Lipton Brand. An<br>
20 	example of such an apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,927,170, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When the functional water of the present invention is <br>
25  	combined with or added to tea powder (i.e., instant tea) to make a superior tea-based beverage, the tea powder is usually prepared by extracting raw tea leaves to produce a concentrated tea extract.  The concentrated tea extract usually contains from about 2 to about 70% by weight solids and it is subsequently <br>
30  	subjected to an evaporation process to remove water, resulting in the desired tea powder.  Illustrative examples of the types of tea powders which may be used in this invention are disclosed in<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   6   -<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,222,182, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the functional water of the <br>
5  	present invention is used with a shelf stable tea concentrate. Such a shelf stable tea concentrate is made by continuous or batch extractions with tea leaves to produce an extract which is centrifuged and concentrated. The resulting concentrate may be pasteurized, aseptically packed and suitable to produce ready-to-<br>
10  	drink (RTD) tea even after being stored for three months.  In an especially preferred embodiment, the shelf stable tea concentrate employed with the functional water of this invention has mixed with it a carbohydrate such as sucrose and/or corn syrup, especially high fructose corn syrup, in order to enhance<br>
15  	concentrate stability.<br>
When making a superior tea-based beverage with the functional water of this invention and shelf stable tea concentrate, typically from about 25 to about 40% by weight of<br>
20  	tea concentrate, (based on total weight of the shelf stable tea concentrate) having about 5 to about 65% by weight tea solids (based on total weight of tea concentrate) is combined with select carbohydrates in a ratio of about 1.5 parts or more of carbohydrate to one part of tea solids. Tea aroma and tea flavor<br>
25  	may be added (collectively between about 5 to about 15% by weight based on total weight of shelf stable tea concentrate). Preservatives (e.g., potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate), acidulants (e.g., citric acid), food grade colorants and water may also be added to the shelf stable tea concentrate and such<br>
30  	additives, collectively, make up from about 5 to about 12% by weight of the total weight of the shelf stable tea concentrate. Carbohydrate, in a preferred embodiment, makes up from about 10<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   7   -<br>
to about 75%, and preferably, from about 40 to about 50% by weight of the shelf stable tea concentrate.<br>
The tea concentrate used to make the preferred stabilized <br>
 5  	tea concentrate suitable for use with the functional water of this invention is derived from conventional processes that use water, and enzyme systems that hydrolyze tea leaf cell walls to yield a tea extract slurry. Leaf is separated from the slurry which is then hot extracted. The resulting tea extract is <br>
10  	pasteurized, concentrated (at least once) and clarified to produce the tea concentrate used to make the preferred shelf stable tea concentrate.<br>
The preferred shelf stable tea concentrates suitable for <br>
15  	use with the functional water of this invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,274,187 and 6,413,570, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When making the superior tea-based beverage with the 20  	functional water of this invention and shelf stable tea<br>
concentrate, any commercially available RTD dispensing apparatus may be used. Such an apparatus is usually equipped with a reservoir for the shelf stable tea concentrate and at least one conduit for delivering the water. In a preferred embodiment, <br>
25  	shelf stable tea concentrate is pumped from the reservoir within the RTD dispensing apparatus and into a mixing chamber. A portion of the functional water of this invention is delivered to the RTD dispensing apparatus and heated within the same to a temperature from about 75 to about 90°C. The resulting heated<br>
30  	functional water is then combined (or simultaneously delivered) with the shelf stable extract within the mixing chamber, yielding a diluted concentrate. The diluted concentrate is then pumped to or combined with additional functional water, preferably at<br><br>
WO 2004/105501	PCT/EP2004/005129<br>
-   8   -<br>
ambient temperature, to produce a superior tea-based beverage. In a preferred embodiment, no more than 10% of the total amount of functional water employed to make the tea-based beverage is heated, and most preferably, from about 0.5% to about 5.0% by <br>
5  	weight of the total amount of functional water is heated.  The preferred apparatus suitable for use with the functional water of this invention is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/027,848, entitled, Beverage Brewing System and Method for Brewing a Beverage and filed December 20, 2001, the disclosure of<br>
10  which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the functional water of this invention has a pH from about 7.0 to about 8.5, and preferably, from about 7.0 to about 7.7.<br>
15<br>
The resulting tea-based beverage obtained, regardless of tea leaf, powder or concentrate is used, typically has enough functional water to yield beverage comprising from about 0.05 to about 6.0%, and preferably, from about 0.1 to about 3.0%, and<br>
20 	most preferably, from about 0.2 to about 0.6% by weight tea solids, based on total weight of the tea-based beverage and including all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
      The superior tea-based beverage prepared from the <br>
25  	functional water of the present invention unexpectedly has superior taste/flavor characteristics, is free of precipitates, and has excellent appearance characteristics.  In an especially preferred embodiment, darkness (L) and redness (a) of the superior tea-based beverage, as determined with a Hunterlab DP<br>
30  9000 Spectrophotometer at about ambient temperature in a 5 cm cell, are each, independently, from about 25 to about 35.<br><br>
