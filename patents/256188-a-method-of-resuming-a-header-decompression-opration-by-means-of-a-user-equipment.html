1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system capable<br>
of providing a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS). More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a method for resuming header<br>
decompression in packet data with compressed headers.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service) is typically based<br>
on GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) and GPRS (General Packet<br>
Radio Services) standards. In contrast to the GMS which uses TDMA (Time<br>
Division Multiple Access), the UMTS employs a wideband CDMA technology<br>
and provides packet-based text, digital voice or video signals, and multimedia<br>
data at a high speed, above 2Mbps regardless of location. The UMTS employs a<br>
switched virtual connection, called a "packet switching system" using a packet<br>
protocol, such as an Internet Protocol (IP). It is possible to access the UMTS<br>
from any end location in a network.<br>
In general, since radio transmission resources are limited, it is inefficient<br>
to transmit data at high speeds to various user equipment. For instance, to<br>
provide one user equipment with a video streaming service of 64kbps, radio<br>
transmission resources capable of transmitting data of 64kbps is needed after<br>
forming a dedicated channel for the user equipment. If there are n user<br>
equipments, the amount of radio transmission resources needed increases by n<br>
times.<br>
Alternatively, service can be provided to plural user equipments through a common channel. In this case, the same service can be provided to the user<br><br>
equipments through the common channel by using the same radio resources<br>
regardless of n if the user equipments are located in the same cell, so radio<br>
resources can be used effectively. The MBMS has been developed based on this<br>
point of view. That is, the MBMS has been developed in order to effectively<br>
transmit the same data to a plurality of user equipments in the UMTS. The<br>
MBMS is efficient and effective when transmitting multimedia data which<br>
requires a great amount of radio transmission resources.<br>
To provide a packet-based multimedia service, a real time transport<br>
protocol (RTP), a user datagram protocol (UDP) and an Internet protocol (IP) are<br>
typically used. When using a combination of the above protocols, a header size<br>
of one packet may exceed 60 bytes, so it is necessary to compress the header to<br>
reduce consumption of the radio transmission resources. In the MBMS, a robust<br>
header compression (ROHC) scheme is used for compressing the header.<br>
Compression and decompression of the header is managed by a packet data<br>
control protocol (PDCP) entity, which manages the protocol of a PDCP layer. In<br>
a particular system, the PDCP entity is provided in a radio network controller<br>
(RNC), which manages a plurality of cells.<br>
As mentioned above, in the case of the MBMS, user equipment<br>
requesting the same MBMS can be located in a plurality of cells, requiring<br>
MBMS data to be transmitted to all the cells. The system may have a PDCP<br>
entity for each cell or a common PDCP entity for several cells. If the PDCP entity<br>
is changed because the user equipment moves between cells with mutually<br>
different PDCP entities, the user equipment reestablishes its connection with<br>
the new PDCP entity.<br>
Reestablishing the PDCP entity connection usually requires a new header<br>
decompressor and header decompression context. To do so, header information<br>
required for header decompression is obtained. However, it is very inefficient if<br>
the user equipment waits for the header information. Thus, it is desirable to<br>
provide a technique allowing the user equipment to rapidly resume header decompression without performing an initialization. When the PDCP entity<br><br>
connection needs to be reestablished from movement between cells.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-<br>
mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, so the present invention provides a<br>
method of reusing a context of an old PDCP entity when it is necessary to<br>
reestablish a header decompressor of a PDCP entity due to the movement of a<br>
user equipment between cells in an MBMS system.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of reusing a context of an<br>
old PDCP entity when it is necessary to reestablish a header decompressor of a<br>
PDCP entity because a user equipment switches a channel type an MBMS system.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of rapidly resuming header<br>
decompression without performing an initializing process by reestablishing a<br>
PDCP entity through reusing predetermined parts of a context of an old PDCP<br>
entity before a new cell and a new radio bearer have been established in an<br>
MBMS system.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of forming the<br>
substantially same header compressor in a plurality of cells by using pre-<br>
configuration information in order to minimize operation of a user equipment<br>
required for reestablishing a PDCP entity in an MBMS system.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of minimizing operation of<br>
a user equipment required for reestablishing a PDCP entity in an MBMS system<br>
by assigning context identifiers to header compression contexts according to a<br>
predetermined rule.<br>
The present invention also provides a method capable of effectively<br>
using radio resources and ensuring continuous reception of services in a user<br>
equipment by effectively initializing a header decompressor when the user<br>
equipment receiving an MBMS resets a radio bearer.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br><br>
method of resuming a header decompression operation by means of a user<br>
equipment (UE) in a communication system capable of providing a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), the method including: moving the UE<br>
receiving the MBMS into a new cell from an old cell; copying and storing old<br>
header decompression context information used in the old cell; initializing a<br>
dynamic part to decompress headers of packet data for the MBMS and waiting<br>
for an IR-DYN (Initialization and Refresh Dynamic) packet until the IR-DYN<br>
packet has been received in the UE, in order to update the old header<br>
decompression information; creating a new header decompression context<br>
through updating the old header decompression information by using the IR-<br>
DYN packet when the IR-DYN packet has been received in the UE; and<br>
decompressing the headers of the packet data for the MBMS transmitted from the<br>
new cell by using the new header decompression context.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of resuming a header decompression operation by means of a user<br>
equipment (UE) in a communication system capable of providing a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), the method including: preparing a plurality<br>
of header compressors and a plurality of header compression contexts, which are<br>
substantially identical to each other, in a plurality of cells according to pre-<br>
configuration information used for the MBMS; moving the UE receiving the<br>
MBMS into a new cell from an old cell; establishing a new header decompressor<br>
for decompressing packet data having compressed headers transmitted from the<br>
new cell; copying and storing old header decompression context information,<br>
which is used in the old cell and includes a context ID, a static part, a dynamic<br>
part and operating parameters; setting values of the operating parameters of the<br>
old header decompression context information with predetermined values;<br>
initializing the dynamic part to decompress headers of packet data for the MBMS<br>
and waiting for an IR-DYN packet until the IR-DYN packet has been received in<br>
the UE, in order to update the old header decompression information; creating a<br>
new header decompression context through updating the old header<br><br>
decompression information by using the IR-DYN packet when the IR-DYN<br>
packet has been received in the UE; and decompressing the headers of the packet<br>
data for the MBMS transmitted from the new cell by using the new header<br>
decompression context.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the<br>
present invention rather unclear. In addition, terms used in the following detailed<br>
description are defined by taking functions of elements used in the present<br>
invention into consideration, and the terms may vary depending on users,<br>
intentions of operators or practices thereof. Thus, definitions of the terms used in<br>
the following description may be determined based on the context of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention suggests a method of rapidly resuming header<br>
decompression in a new cell of a mobile communication system with MBMS, in<br>
which a header decompressor and a header decompression context are<br>
reestablished for the new cell by means of a user equipment moving between<br>
cells. The cells have mutually different header decompressors and header<br>
decompression contexts, and the reestablished header decompression context is<br>
updated by using an old header decompression context, thereby rapidly resuming<br>
header decompression.<br>
First, the MBMS used for the present invention will be described.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view illustrating a schematic structure of a mobile<br>
communication system capable of providing the MBMS. Herein, the MBMS is<br>
applied to a 3GPP (3rd Generation Project Partnership) system, which is the<br>
standard for a 3rd asynchronous mobile communication scheme.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 1, user equipments (UEs) 161, 162, 163, 171 and 172<br>
represent terminals or subscribers for receiving the MBMS, and first and second<br>
cells 160 and 170 represent base stations capable of transmitting data related to<br>
MBMS to the UEs. As shown in FIG. 1, only one radio channel is formed<br>
between the first cell 160 and the UEs 161, 162 and 163 to provide the MBMS.<br>
An RNC 140 is a radio network controller for controlling a plurality of cells.<br>
The RNC 140 controls radio channels used for selectively transmitting<br>
multimedia data to a specific cell and for providing the MBMS to the UEs.<br>
A serving GPRS supporting node (SGSN) 130 controls services of<br>
subscribers related to the MBMS. For instance, the SGSN 130 may manage data<br>
related to the service charge of each subscriber and selectively transmit<br>
multimedia data to a specific RNC. A transit network 120 provides a<br>
communication path between a broadcast/multicast service center (BM-SC) 110<br>
and the SGSN 130 and includes a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) and an<br>
external network. The BM-SC 110 is a source for MBMS data and manages<br>
scheduling of data for each service.<br>
An MBMS data stream is transferred to the UEs 161, 162, 163, 171<br>
andl72 through the transit network 120, the SGSN 130, the RNC 140 and cells<br>
160 and 170. Although they are not shown, a plurality of RNCs can be provided<br>
for plural SGSNs or for each SGSN and MBMS service. The SGSN selectively<br>
transmits data to the RNC and the RNC selectively transmits data to the cells. To<br>
this end, the SGSN and the RNC store lists for transmitting the data stream.<br>
That is, the SGSN stores the list of the RNCs and the RNC stores the list of the<br>
cells therein in order to selectively transmit MBMS data to the RNCs and the<br>
cells.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view illustrating a layered structure of a user interface for<br>
transmitting data and signaling messages between the user equipment and the<br>
RNC. Herein, the layered structure of the user interface is divided into a control<br>
plane (C-plane) used for switching a control signal between the UE and the RNC<br>
 and a user plane (U-plane) used for transmitting data.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a C-plane signaling 200 is processed through a radio<br>
resource control ("RRC") entity 204, a radio link control ("RLC") entity 210, a<br>
media access control ("MAC") entity 212, and a physical ("PHY") entity 214. In<br>
addition, U-plane information 202 is processed through a packet data control<br>
protocol ("PDCP") entity 206, a broadcast/multicast control ("BMC") entity 208,<br>
the RLC entity 210, the MAC entity 212 and the PHY entity 214. In general, the<br>
PHY entity 214 is located in each cell, and remaining entities from the MAC<br>
entity 212 to the RRC entity 204 are located in the RNC.<br>
The PHY entity 214 provides an information transmit service by using a<br>
radio transfer technique. The PHY entity 214 is a first layer of an open systems<br>
interconnection model (OSI). The PHY entity 214 is connected to the MAC<br>
entity 212 through transport channels aligned therebetween. The transport<br>
channel is defined based on a processing scheme for specific data at a physical<br>
layer.<br>
The MAC entity 212 is connected to the RLC entity 210 through logical<br>
channels. The MAC entity 212 transfers data from the RLC entity 210, through<br>
the logical channel, to the physical layer through a predetermined transport<br>
channel, and transfers data from the PHY entity 214, through the transport<br>
channel, to the RLC entity 210 through a predetermined logical channel. In<br>
addition, the MAC entity 212 inserts additional information to data transmitted<br>
through the logical or transport channel, performs a proper action by analyzing<br>
the additional information, and controls random access operation.<br>
The RLC entity 210 sets or releases the logical channels. The RLC entity<br>
210 can be operated in an acknowledged mode (AM), an unacknowledged mode<br>
(UM) and a transparent mode (TM). providing different functions in each mode.<br>
In general, the RLC entity 210 may divide the service data unit (SDU) of an<br>
upper layer into several units having predetermined sizes, or combine the divided<br>
units. In addition, the RLC entity 210 may correct errors through an automatic<br>
repeat request (ARQ).<br>
The PDCP entity 206 is located on a layer in the U-plane that is higher<br><br>
than the RLC entity 210. The PDCP entity 206 compresses or decompresses IP<br>
packet data headers or transfers data without loss when the RNC is switched<br>
movement of the UE. For general service, the PDCP entity 206 has a lossless<br>
SRNS (serving RNS) relocation support function and a header compression<br>
function. However, with MBMS, it is not necessary to provide the lossless SRNS<br>
relocation support function because of the characteristics of the<br>
broadcast/multicasting.<br>
Herein, the SRNS relocation refers to UE movement into a cell<br>
controlled by an RNC other than the SRNC and, resets the new RNC as the<br>
new SRNC.<br>
The BMC entity 208 is located in a class above the RLC entity 210 to<br>
support a broadcasting service of the same data to a plurality of UEs from a<br>
specific cell.<br>
When calls for a specific service are set, the RNC establishes entities for<br>
processing protocols of PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY layers. Herein, a set of protocol<br>
entities used for providing the specific service is called a "radio bearer (RB)".<br>
The entities can be formed by a hardware device, a software-executing block, or<br>
a combination of hardware and software. Forming the protocol entities indicates<br>
that operating parameters have been provided to the hardware device or<br>
software block forming the entitites. An access position between the protocol<br>
entities is called a "service access point (SAP)". For instance, a contact point<br>
between the PDCP entity and the RLC entity is called an "RLC SAP". Primitives,<br>
such as RLC-DATA-REQ, which is user data transmitted to the RLC entity from<br>
the PDCP entity, are transferred through the RLC SAP.<br>
The RRC entity 204 controls allocation or release of radio resources<br>
between an UTRAN and the UE. The RRC entity 204 manages radio resources<br>
allocated to the UEs and their mobility. In addition, when there are core network<br>
signals to be transferred to the UEs, the RRC entity 204 transfers the core<br>
network signals to corresponding UEs.<br>
To provide UEs with service, the context, which is a set of information<br><br>
for providing the services, is created between UEs and network nodes (RNC,<br>
SGSN, etc). The context includes a UE context and a mobility management<br>
(MM) context. For example, if the UEs want to receive the MBMS, the MBMS<br>
context is provided for the network nodes. The MBMS may allow a plurality of<br>
UEs to receive the same information simultaneously, so the MBMS service<br>
context is not created for each UE, but created for each MBMS or each session in<br>
the service. The same header compression/decompression contexts are provided<br>
between the RNC and the UE for the PDCP entity performing compression and<br>
decompression of the header. The header compression/decompression contexts<br>
include all non-compressed header information of packet data related to the<br>
corresponding MBMS and are updated whenever packet data is transmitted or<br>
received.<br>
Hereinafter, a header compression operation by means of the PDCP<br>
entity, in particular, a robust header compression (ROHC) operation used for the<br>
MBMS will be briefly described.<br>
The MBMS data is provided in the form of RTP/UDP/IP packets. The<br>
RTP/UDP/IP header includes various information fields, such as protocol version,<br>
header length, service type, whole length, packet ID, time to live (TTL), protocol<br>
ID, header checksum for a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), IP addresses of a<br>
source and a destination, and a UDP port number. The RTP/UDP/IP header has a<br>
size of about 60 bytes, which is too large to be transmitted through the radio<br>
channel.<br>
The RTP/UDP/IP header has a predetermined tendency making it is<br>
possible to reduce the size of the RTP/UDP/IP header by a technique called<br>
"header compression".<br>
For example, in the RTP/UDP/IP header, the IP address and the UDP port<br>
number are unchanged while the MBMS is provided. The IP address and the<br>
UDP port number are transmitted several times only at the start of MBMS<br>
transmissions. Such header fields are called "static header fields". The static<br>
header fields are stored in a static part of the context related to the MBMS. In<br><br>
addition, some fields, such as a serial number (SN) field of the RTP, may vary in<br>
each packet. For example, the SN field of the RTP may be increased by 1 in each<br>
packet. Such header fields are called "dynamic fields". The dynamic fields are<br>
transferred to a receiver whenever the dynamic fields are changed and the<br>
changed values of the dynamic fields are stored in the dynamic part of the<br>
context.<br>
The header compressor of the PDCP entity of the RNC compresses the<br>
headers received from the core network based on the header compression context<br>
and updates the header decompression context in each packet stream. The packet<br>
stream is defined as a set of packets having the same static header fields. For<br>
instance, one media component of one MBMS is defined as one packet stream.<br>
One header compressor can compresses a plurality of packet streams. In this case,<br>
a plurality of contexts are used. At this time, the contexts are identified by means<br>
of context identification (CID). In short, the header compression/decompression<br>
context includes the CID, the static part, and the dynamic part.<br>
The context further includes operating parameters for header<br>
compression/decompression. The operating parameters include additional<br>
information, utilized when the header compression/decompression operations are<br>
performed on a specific packet stream. The operating parameters will be<br>
described later in detail.<br>
Upon receiving the first packet data of a packet stream in the MBMS, the<br>
header compressor initializes the static part and the dynamic part of the MBMS<br>
context by using the header fields of the packet data. In addition, the header<br>
compressor determines the CID used for the packet stream and repeatedly<br>
transmits an initialization and refresh packet (IR packet) with all the information<br>
related to the CID, the static part, and the dynamic part to the header<br>
decompressor of the PDCP entity for the UE. The header decompressor receives<br>
the IR packets and initializes the context of the header decompressor for header<br>
decompression. That is, the header decompressor overlaps information from the<br>
static part and the dynamic part in the IR packets on the context.<br><br>
After the header decompressor transmits a predetermined amount of IR<br>
packets sufficient for initializing the context, the header compressor transmits the<br>
packet data with compressed headers. At this time, if the ROHC scheme is<br>
employed, the packet data with the compressed headers are called "ROHC<br>
packets". When compressing the header, the dynamic header fields are<br>
transmitted only when values of the dynamic header fields are changed without<br>
transmitting the static header fields. The header decompressor adds static header<br>
fields, which are read from the static part of the context, to the received packet,<br>
decompresses values of the dynamic header fields, and updates the contexts by<br>
using the decompressed header field values. That is, the header compressor and<br>
the header decompressor operate based on the contexts. So, the contexts are<br>
updated in the same way so that the updated contexts in the header compressor<br>
and decompressor match.<br>
If there is any context inconsistency between the header compressor and<br>
the header decompressor, the header decompressor may erroneously decompress<br>
the header, corrupting data. Context inconsistencies mainly occur in the dynamic<br>
part. To prevent an inconsistency, the ROHC may periodically transmit the IR<br>
packets with all information related to the static part and the dynamic part and<br>
with initialization and refresh dynamic (IR-DYN) packets including only<br>
 information of the dynamic part. Although the period of the IR/IR-DYN packets<br>
is not defined in the ROHC standard disclosed in the RFC (request for<br>
communication) 3095, the periodic transmission period of the IR-DYN packet is<br>
generally shorter than the periodic transmission period of the IR packet.<br>
When context synchronization is achieved between the header<br>
 compressor and the header decompressor by the IR/IR-DYN packets, the header<br>
compressor transmits the packets with compressed headers (for example, ROHC<br>
packets) according to the context. The header decompressor then decompresses<br>
the compressed header by using the same context used for header compression<br>
As described above, the dynamic and static parts of the contexts are periodically<br>
 synchronized by the IR/RI-DYN packet.<br><br>
When the UE moves into a new cell, if the new cell uses a different<br>
PDCP entity, the UE reestablishes the PDCP entity of the new cell. In addition, if<br>
the UE wants to switch channel type during communication, the UE can<br>
reestablish the PDCP entity. In this case, the initialization procedure allows the<br>
reestablished PDCP entity to continuously perform the MBMS.<br>
The initialization procedure is a procedure performed by the header<br>
decompressor to receive the IR packet transmitted from the header compressor.<br>
However, since the transmission period of the IR packet is significantly larger<br>
than the transmission period of the IR-DYN packet, the UE, after moving into the<br>
new cell, may not receive the IR packet until after waiting a long time. As a<br>
result, header decompression is suspended until the IR packet is received.<br>
As mentioned above, information in the context includes the CID, the<br>
static part and the dynamic part. Since the static part has the same value for the<br>
same packet stream, the static part of the context for the old cell can be used for<br>
the new cell. Therefore, according to the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the IR-DYN packet is used instead of the IR packet to update the<br>
dynamic part of the context for the new cell. Since the IR-DYN packet is more<br>
frequently transmitted than the IR packet, the UE can stably establish the context<br>
for the new cell within a relatively short period of time using the IR-DYN packet,<br>
instead of the IR packet.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view illustrating a shift of the UE receiving the MBMS<br>
between cells in an MBMS communication system according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Herein, a first RNC 310-1 includes a first<br>
cell 335-2 and a third cell 335-1, a second RNC 310-2 includes a second cell<br>
335-3 and a fourth cell 335-4, and a UE 340 receiving the MBMS in the first cell<br>
335-2 is moved into the second cell 335-3 while continuously receiving the<br>
MBMS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a network providing the MBMS includes a core<br>
network (CN) 305, RNC entities 310-1 and 310-2, and plural cells 335-1, 335-2,<br>
335-3, and 335-4. The RNC entities 310-1 and 310-2 convert data transmitted<br><br>
from the CN 305 to adapt the date for the radio channel and transmit the<br>
converted data to each cell. To this end, each of the RNC entities 310-1 and 310-<br>
2 includes PDCP entities 315-1 and 315-2, RLC entities 320-1 and 320-2, and<br>
MAC entities 325-1, 325-2, 325-3 and 325-4.<br>
The RNC entities 310-1 and 310-2 divide the data of the upper layer into<br>
a predetermined size so such that the data can be transmitted through the radio<br>
channel, and inserts sequence numbers into the data. The RLC entities 320-1 and<br>
320-2 shared by plural cells, or may be individually formed in each cell.<br>
According to the present invention, the RLC entities 320-1 and 320-2 are shared<br>
by plural cells. The MAC entities 325-1, 325-2, 325-3 and 325-4 insert IDs into<br>
the MAC layer headers of each packet to identify a particular service in one<br>
radio channel. Each of the MAC entities 325-1, 325-2, 325-3 and 325-4 is<br>
formed in each cell.<br>
The PDCP entities 315-1 and 315-2 compress the packet data of the core<br>
network 305 according to a predetermined compression scheme and transfer<br>
the compressed packet data to the RLC entities 320-1 and 320-2. To this end, the<br>
PDCP entities 315-1 and 315-2 include header compressors 345 and 350, and<br>
header compression contexts 345-1, 345-2, 350-1 and 350-2 for storing<br>
information required for header compression , respectively.<br>
The header compressors 345 and 350 transfer packets having compressed<br>
headers corresponding to each MBMS service, and header decompressors 355<br>
and 360 decompress the compressed headers by using header decompression<br>
contexts 355-1, 355-2, 365-1 and 365-2. The dynamic parts and static parts of the<br>
above contexts 345-1, 345-2, 350-1, 350-2, 355-1, 355-2, 365-1 and 365-2 are<br>
periodically synchronized by means of the IR/IR-DYN packets.<br>
The contexts for the packet streams processed in each header compressor<br>
345 or 350 are distinguished from each other by C1D. In FIG. 3, the CIDs<br>
assigned to the header compression contexts 345-1, 345-2, 350-1 and 350-2 are<br>
illustrated as n, n+1, m and m+1, respectively.<br>
The first and third cells 335-2 and 335-1 located at a lower layer of the<br><br>
first RNC 310-1 share the same PDCP entity 315-1. In addition, the second and<br>
fourth cells 335-3 and 335-4 located at a lower layer of the second RNC 310-2<br>
share the same PDCP entity 315-2. Hereinafter, the description will be made for<br>
an operation of the UE 340 to resume the MBMS when moving from the first cell<br>
335-2 to the second cell 335-3.<br>
To receive the MBMS in the first cell 335-2, the UE 340 uses the<br>
PHY entity, the MAC entity, the RLC entity and the PDCP entity. In the first cell<br>
335-2, the header decompressor 360 of the UE 340 decompresses compressed<br>
header, by using the header decompression contexts 360-1 and 360-2. The header<br>
decompression contexts 360-1 and 360-2 are synchronized with the header<br>
compression contexts 345-1 and 345-2 of the header compressor 345.<br>
If the UE 340 is moved into the second cell 335-3, the UE 340<br>
reestablishes PHY/MAC/RLC/PDCP entities for processing the MBMS data<br>
transmitted from the second cell 335-3 because the second cell 335-3 has a<br>
different PDCP entity than that of the first cell 335-2. Thus, the UE 340 obtains<br>
system information, which is periodically broadcasted in the second cell 335-3,<br>
to establish the above entities. More specificfally, to decompress the packet data<br>
with the compressed header the UE 340 establishes the header decompressor 355<br>
and the header decompression contexts 355-1 and 355-2, and then receives the<br>
MBMS by using the header decompressor 355 and the header decompression<br>
contexts 355-1 and 355-2.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of resuming an MBMS for<br>
the UE moving between cells according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a UE may reestablish a PDCP entity by first<br>
determining if reestablishment of header compression is necessary (step 405).<br>
Herein, the UE can determine the reestablishment of header compression based<br>
on various factors. For instance, when the UE detects a different PDCP entity, or<br>
when the UE detects a switch in the channel type of the MBMS A channel type<br>
switch is described below.Forward transmission output may be used excessively<br><br>
to provide the MBMS. In particular, MBMS service is provided to the UEs<br>
through the common channel, even if only a few UEs want to receive the MBMS,<br>
thereby wasting radio transmission resources. For this reason, when providing<br>
MBMS in the 3GPP. the number of UEs in the same cell receiving MBMS is<br>
considered.<br>
In furtherdetail, if the number of UEs receiving MBMS in a cell is less<br>
than a predetermined reference number, the MBMS service is provided to the<br>
UEs through dedicated channels for the UEs. If the number of the UEs receiving<br>
MBMS in acell is more than the predetermined reference number of the UEs, the<br>
MBMS service is provided to the UEs through the common channel. Therefore,<br>
channel type can be switched from the common channel to the dedicated channel<br>
or vice versa according to the number of UEs receiving the MBMS in the same<br>
cell. The channel type of the UE can also be switched if the UE is moved into a<br>
different cell providing using a different channel type.<br>
When the channel type is switched, all of protocol entities forming the<br>
radio bearer, such as PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY entities, are reestablished.<br>
In step 410, the UE takes a snapshot of the context used in the header<br>
decompressor of the old PDCP entity. The old PDCP entity is discarded when a<br>
header decompressor and context of a new PDCP are established.<br>
In step 415, the UE reestablishes the PDCP entity and feeds the old<br>
context information to the new PDCP entity. In step 420, the UE sets the<br>
operating parameters with proper values. Step 420 will be described later in<br>
detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
In step 425, the UE receives the packet data of the new PDCP entity of<br>
the new cell through the RCL layer. Since the above packet data is processed by<br>
the PDCP entity, the above packet data are called "packet datagram units"<br>
including a PDCP header and a PDCP payload. In step 430, the UE checks<br>
whether the received packet data are IR-DYN packets with the CID and the<br>
dynamic part required for head compression. If the received packet data are the IR-DYN packets, step 440 is performed. Otherwise, step 435 is performed.<br><br>
In step 435, since the header decompression context with the new cell<br>
has not been yet established, the UE determines that header decompression<br>
cannot resume. Thus, the UE stores the received packet data to decompress<br>
later and returns to step 425. The UE can discard the received packet data if<br>
itdetermincs that the data is not necessary. The receiving and storing (or<br>
discarding) operations are repeated until the IR-DYN packets are received.<br>
That is, the header decompression operation of the UE issuspended in step 430<br>
until the IR-DYN packet has been received in the UE from the new cell.<br>
In step 440, the UE corrects the CID of the old context information by<br>
using the IR-DYN packetbecause the CID of the old cell may be different from<br>
the CID of the new cell for the same MBMS. CID correction will be described<br>
later in detail with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
In step 445, the UE updates the dynamic part of the old context<br>
information by using the IR-DYN packet to establish the new context. In step<br>
450, the UE begins header decompression by using the new PDCP entity and<br>
the new context. At this time, if the UE includes stored packet data with<br>
headerthat have not yet been decompressed, the UE may decompress the stored<br>
packet data headers by using the new context.<br>
Hereinafter, the method for creating the new context by updating the old<br>
context information will be described in detail.<br>
As described above, the MBMS includes a plurality of media, each of<br>
which consists of at least one packet stream. Such a multimedia service can be<br>
provided through a radio network according to the following three schemes.<br>
In the first scheme, a plurality of PDCP entities are established fora<br>
plurality of media streams in such a manner that each PDCP entity can<br>
simultaneously process the RTP stream and the RTCP (real-time transport control<br>
protocol) stream. Herein, the RTP is a protocol for transmitting actual media,<br>
such as voice or videos, and the RTCP is an auxiliary protocol used for each RTP<br>
stream.<br>
	According to a second scheme, one PDCP entity is established for a<br><br>
plurality of media streams in such a manner that the PDCP entity can<br>
simultaneously process the RTP streams and the RTCP streams.<br>
And in the third scheme, a plurality of PDCP entities are established for a<br>
plurality of media streams in such a manner that each PDCP entity processes only<br>
the RTP stream.<br>
For example, if the MBMS includes voice and video media,<br>
according to the first scheme, the RNC establishes the PDCP entities of P1 and<br>
P2 forthe voice and video media in such a manner that the RTCP stream related<br>
to the voice media stream is provided through P1 and the RTCP stream related to<br>
the video media stream is provided through P2.<br>
According to the second scheme, the RNC establishes one PDCP entity<br>
in such a manner that the voice media stream, the RTCP stream related to the<br>
voice media stream, the video media stream, and the RTCP stream related to the<br>
video media stream is provided through the PDCP entity.<br>
According to the third scheme, the RNC establishes the PDCP entities of P1 <br>
and P2 forthe voice and video media in such a manner that the voice media<br>
stream is provided through P1 and the video media stream is provided through P2.<br>
Since header compression and decompression is done for each stream,<br>
the above three schemes may relate to the number of contexts existing in one<br>
PDCP entity. That is, in the first scheme, one PDCP entity requires two contexts<br>
for the RTP stream and the RTCP stream. In the second scheme, one PDCP entity<br>
requires four contexts for two RTP streams and two RTCP streams. In the third<br>
scheme, one PDCP entity requires one context for one RTC stream.<br>
If the PDCP entity includes only one context, as in the third scheme,<br>
CID correction can be achieved easily. In this case, the new PDCP entity simply<br>
replaces the CID of the old context information with the CID of the IR-DYN<br>
packet from the radio bearer of the new cell. However, if the PDCP entity<br>
includes at least two contexts, as in the first and second schemes, the CID<br>
correction may be more complex.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure of CID correction when<br><br>
one PDCP entity processes the RTP media and the RTCP stream. FIG. 5 shows<br>
steps 430 and 440 shown in FIG. 4 in detail.<br>
In this embodiment, the new PDCP entity is established to compress the<br>
media ml of a specific MBMS x, and includes a contexts for decompressing the<br>
RTP and RTCP streams. Accordingly, the new PDCP entity receives information<br>
about two contexts of the old PDCP and divides the received contexts into an<br>
RTP stream context and an RTCP stream context.<br>
Referring to FIG 5, the UE receives the IR-DYN packet from the new<br>
cell (step 505). The IR-DYN packet includes a CID, a profile and a dynamic part.<br>
The profile represents the header compression scheme applied to the context,<br>
which is identified by the CID. For instance, a profile 0 represents that header<br>
compression is not applied to the context, a profile 1 represents the RTP/UDP/IP<br>
header compression, and a profile 2 represents the UDP/IP header compression.<br>
The UE inspects whether the IR-DYN packet relates to the RTP or the<br>
RTCP by the profile value. Since the RTP stream is compressed with profile 1,<br>
the content of the IR-DYN packet with profile 1 are applied to the context for the<br>
RTP. In addition, since the RTCP packet is not compressed or is compressed with<br>
the UDP/IP compression scheme, the content of the IR-DYN packet having the<br>
profile 0 or the profile 2 is applied to the context for the RTCP.<br>
In step 510, the UE inspects the profile of the IR-DYN packet. If the<br>
profile value is 0 or 2, it is determined that the IR-DYN packet relates to the<br>
RTCP stream so that step 520 is performed. If the profile value is 1, it is<br>
determined that the IR-DYN packet relates to the RTP stream and step 515<br>
isperformed. In step 515, the UE replaces the CID<br>
(Decompression_CID_old_x_ml_RTP) of the RTP context with the CID<br>
(CIDreceived) of the IR-DYN packet. In addition, as described above with<br>
reference to FIG 4, the UE updates the dynamic part of the RTP context<br>
according to the IR-DYN packet. In step 520, the UE replaces the CID<br>
(Decompression_CID_old_x_ml_RTCP) of the RTCP context with the CID<br>
(CID_received) of the IR-DYN packet. In addition, as described above with<br><br>
reference to FIG. 4, the UE updates the dynamic part of the RTCP context<br>
according to the IR-DYN packet.<br>
Hereinafter, the procedure shown in FIG. 5 will be described in detail.<br>
A cell yl provides the MBMS service x consisting of two media ml<br>
and m2, and RTCP packets for the two media are intermittently generated. The<br>
ml header consisting of the RTP media stream and the RTCP media stream is<br>
compressed through the PDCP entity P1, the CID of the first header compression<br>
context for the RTP media stream is set to 1, and the CID of the second header<br>
compression context for the RTCP media stream is set to 2. Profile 1 is applied to<br>
the first header compression context and the profile 2 is applied to the second<br>
header compression context.<br>
The UE located in the cell yl includes the PDCP entity of P1' for<br>
receiving the MBMS service x. The PDCP entity P1' includes first and second<br>
header decompression contexts in order to decompress the RTP media stream and<br>
the RTPC media stream with profile values of 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
As the UE movs into the new cell yl, the UE establishes the new PDCP<br>
entity P2'. Accordingly, the UE transfers the first and second header<br>
decompression contexts used in the PDCP entity P1' to the new PDCP entity P2'.<br>
The new PDCP entity P2' recognizes the first header decompression context as<br>
the context for the RTP media stream and recognizes the second header<br>
decompression context as the context for the RTCP media stream.<br>
For example, if the new PDCP entity P2' receives the IR-DYN packet [5]<br>
having the CID of 5, the UE inspects the profile of the IR-DYN packet. If the<br>
profile of the IR-DYN packet [5] is 1, the CID of the first header decompression<br>
context is corrected as 5, and the dynamic part of the first header decompression<br>
context is updated based on the IR-DYN packet [5].<br>
In the cell y2, the first header decompression context is used for<br>
decompressing the headers of packets having the CID of 5. Forexample, if the<br>
UE receives the IR-DYN packet [10] having the CID of 10 and the profile of the<br>
IR-DYN packet [10] is 2, the UE sets the CID of the second header<br><br>
decompression context as 10 and updates the dynamic part of the second header<br>
decompression context based on the IR-DYN packet [10]. In the cell y2, the<br>
second header decompression context is used for decompressing the headers of<br>
packets having the CID of 10.<br>
The above description has been made in relation to the first scheme, in<br>
which one PDCP entity processes one media stream. However, if one PDCP<br>
entity processes a plurality of media, each of which includes a plurality of media<br>
streams, as described above with reference to the second scheme, it is too<br>
difficult to discriminate the streams by using the profile information only.<br>
For instance, the UE may include the RTP context (CID = x) for media<br>
ml, the RTP context (CID = y) for media m2, the RTCP context (CID = w) for<br>
media ml, and the RTCP context (CID = z) for media m2 in relation to the PDCP<br>
entity P1'. In this case, after establishing the new PDCP entity P2', the UE<br>
provides the contexts to the PDCP entity P2' and waits for the IR-DYN packet to<br>
update the CIDs of the contexts.<br>
If the UE receives the IR-DYN packet [CID = a, profile = 0 or 2], the IR-<br>
DYN packet [CID = b, profile = 0 or 2], the IR-DYN packet [CID = c, profile =<br>
1 ] or the IR-DYN packet [CID = d, profile = 1], the UE recognizes that the c and<br>
d are CIDs for RTP contexts and a and b are CIDs for RTCP contexts. However,<br>
the UE does not recognize the relationship between the CIDs c and d and the<br>
media ml and m2 for the RTP contexts. In addition, the UE does not recognize<br>
the relationship between the CIDs a and b and the media ml and m2 for the<br>
RTCP contexts.<br>
The IR-DYN packets have payload type (PT) fields representing the code<br>
used for coding the RTP payload. For example, PT 3 represents a GSM voice<br>
coding, PT 12 represents a Q-CELP (Qualcomm Code Excited Linear<br>
Predication) voice coding, and PT 34 represents H.263 video coding. Since the<br>
contexts used for decompressing headers of RTP protocol have PT values, the UE<br>
compares the PT value of the IR-DYN packet with the PT values of the contexts,<br>
thereby checking whether the contexts correspond to the IR-DYN packet.<br><br>
For instance, if the PR value included in the RTP context of the media<br>
ml is "e" and the PR value included in the RTP context of the media ml is "f',<br>
the CID of the IR-DYN packet with the PT value of V becomes the CID of the<br>
RTP context and the CID of the IR-DYN packet having the PT value of "f'<br>
becomes the CID of the RTCP context.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure of CID correction by the<br>
PDCP entity when one PDCP entity processes two media and two RTCP streams<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Herein, the UE includes contexts for the RTP media streams and contexts<br>
for the RTCP streams for the new PDCP entity. The new PDCP entity processes<br>
the media ml and ml, and contexts for the RTP and RTCP streams may exist for<br>
each of the media ml and ml. Thus, the new PDCP entity receives information<br>
related to four contexts of the old PDCP entity. The new PDCP entity stores the<br>
RTP context of the media ml as RTRTPml and the RTP context of the media<br>
ml as RT_RTP_m2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the UE receives the IR-DYN packet with a<br>
predetermined CID (step 605). The IR-DYN packet includes a CID, a profile and<br>
a dynamic part. If the IR-DYN packet relates to the RTP, the dynamic part<br>
includes the PT value.<br>
In step 610, the UE inspects the profile of the IR-DYN packet. If the<br>
profile value is 0 or 2, the IR-DYN packet relates to the RTCP media stream and<br>
step 630 is performed. If the profile value is 1, the IR-DYN packet relates to the<br>
RTP stream andthat step 615 isperformed.<br>
In step 615, the UE inspects the PT (PTreceived) of the IR-DYN packet.<br>
If the PT (PTreceived) of the IR-DYN packet is identical to the PT<br>
(PT_RTP_ml) of the RTP context of the media ml, step 625 isperformed.<br>
Otherwise, step 620 is performed. In step 620, the UE replaces the CID<br>
(CID_RTP_m2) of the RTP context of the media ml with the CID<br>
(CID_received) of the IR-DYN packet. After that, the UE updates the dynamic<br>
part of the RTP context of the media ml by using the dynamic part of the IR-<br><br>
DYN packet and resumes header decompression the updated context.<br>
In step 625, the UE replaces the CID (CID_RTP_ml) of the RTP context<br>
of the media ml with the CID (CID_received) of the IR-DYN packet. After that,<br>
the UE updates the dynamic part of the RTP context of the media ml by using the<br>
dynamic part of the IR-DYN packet and resumes header decompression with the<br>
updated context.<br>
In step 630, the PCDP entity matches the CID (CIDreceived) of the IR-<br>
DYN packet with a proper context. Since the IR-DYN packet for the RTCP<br>
stream does not include the PT, it becomes very complicated to match the RTCP<br>
streams with proper media streams.<br>
The UE checks whether the profile of the IR-DYN packet is 0 or 2. If the<br>
profile of the IR-DYN packet is 0, it means that the header compression is not<br>
employed. Thus, the UE determines the RTCP stream which matches with the<br>
ID-DYN packet by using the UDP port number.<br>
If the profile of the IR-DYN packet is 2, it means that header<br>
compression was used in the UDP/ID header, so the RTCP stream cannot be<br>
matched with the CID by using the IR-DYN packet only. So the UE defers CID<br>
correction for the RTCP stream until the IR packet is received. When the IR<br>
packet is received, the UE performs CID correction based on the UDP port<br>
number in the IR packet by searching the context for the RTCP stream with a<br>
matching UDP port number, and sets the CID of the context of the RTCP<br>
stream as the CID of the IR packet.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of setting operating<br>
parameters according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the UE provides the new PDCP entity with the<br>
operating parameters of the old context information from the old PDCP entity<br>
(step 705). The operating parameters include D_MODE, DSTATE, DTRANS,<br>
and parameters required for decompressing the RTP time stamp. DJVIODE<br>
represents the present mode of the header decompressor, DSTATE represents<br>
the present state of the context, and DTRANS represents whether the header<br><br>
decompressor mode is being switched. Since the parameters required for<br>
decompressing the RTP time stamp have static values, the parameter values used<br>
in the old PDCP entity are reused.<br>
In step 710, if the DMODE of the old context is not "U", the UE sets<br>
the D_MODE of the old context information as "U". As mentioned above,<br>
DMODE represents the present mode of the header decompressor and may<br>
includes "U" signifying a unidirectional mode, "O" signifying an optimistic<br>
mode, and "R" signifying a reliable mode of transmission.<br>
In step 715, the UE sets the DSTATE of the old context information to<br>
"STATIC CONTEXT". D_STATE represents the present state of the context<br>
and includes "NO CONTEXT", "STATIC CONTEXT" and "FULL CONTEXT".<br>
"NO CONTEXT" indicates that context does not exist, so the header<br>
decompression operation cannot be executed until the UE receives the IR<br>
packet. "STATIC CONTEXT" indicates that only static part of the context may<br>
exist, so the header decompression can be executed by updating the dynamic part<br>
by receiving the IR-DYN packet, etc. In addition, "FULL CONTEXT"<br>
indicates that all the context information may exist, so that header<br>
decompression can be executed instantly. According to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the header decompressor resumes header<br>
decompression after receiving the IR-DYN packet, so DSTATE is set to<br>
STATIC CONTEXT.<br>
In step 720, the UE sets DTRANS of the old context information to<br>
DONE. DTRANS is a parameter representing whether the header<br>
decompressor mode is being switched. If the header decompressor mode is being<br>
switched, DTRANS is set as "PENDING". Otherwise, DTRANS is set to<br>
DONE. Since the new PDP entity may operate in the unidirectional mode,<br>
DMODE of the new PDCP entity is set to DOEN.<br>
The above description applies to a method for establishing the new<br>
PDCP entity by using old PDCP entity context. According to alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the new PDCP entity for the MBMS can be<br><br>
established by pre-configuration information to simplify establishing a<br>
connection with a new PDCP entity. To do so, a plurality of RNCs establish the<br>
PDCP entity and the header compressor by using the same pre-configuration<br>
information. Thus, the RNCs may use substantially the same PDCP entity so that<br>
cells providing the MBMS transmit data that was generated based on the same<br>
PDCP entity.<br>
In accordance with this alternative embodiment, the RNCs establish the<br>
PDCP entities for the MBMS by using the same pre-configuration information.<br>
Thus, the RNCs have substantially the same PDCP entities, header compressors<br>
and header compression contexts. If the MBMS includes a plurality of media<br>
streams, the header compression contexts of the RNCs may each have the same<br>
CID or the media streams.<br>
FIG. 8 is a view illustrating configuration information of a predetermined<br>
PDCP according to an embodiment of the present invention for establishing the<br>
PDCP entities in the RNCs for the UEs to establish the corresponding PDCP<br>
entities.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a "PDCP PDU header" 802 represents existence or<br>
absence of the PDCP header. Since the PDCP header is not an essential part in<br>
the header compression operation, it can be omitted. Header compression<br>
information 804 includes a CID inclusion info 806, a maximum CID<br>
(MAX_CID) 808, and a reverse decompression depth 810. The CID inclusion<br>
info 806 indicates whether the CID value is included in the ROHC packet or the<br>
PDCP header. In FIG. 8, the CID is included in the ROHC packet. The maximum<br>
CID (MAXCID) 808 represents the maximum CID value for the header<br>
compressor/decompressor. Herein, the maximum value of the CID is 15. The<br>
reverse decompression depth 810 is a parameter indicating storage capacity of<br>
the packets that fail to decompress the headers. In FIG. 8, the reverse<br>
decompression depth 810 is assumed to be "0", which means that packets<br>
failing to decompress the headers; may be instantly discarded. To discriminate<br>
the same header compression contexts having a plurality of RNCs, the RNCs<br><br>
allocate the CIDs to the header compression contexts according to the following<br>
predetermined order. Herein, one header compressor/decompressor may perform<br>
the header compression/decompression operation for n media.<br>
-	CID 0 is allocated to a stream of the RTP media using the lowest UDP<br>
port number.<br>
-	CID 1 is allocated to the RTCP stream of the RTP media having CID 0.<br>
-	CID 2 is allocated to a stream of the RTP media using the second<br>
lowest UDP port number.<br>
-	CID 3 is allocated to the RTCP stream of the RTP media having CID 2.<br>
-	CID (x-1) * 2 is allocated to a stream of the RTP media using the xth<br>
lowest UDP port number.<br>
-	CID (x-1) * 2-1 is allocated to a RTCP stream of the RTP media having<br>
the CID (x-1)* 2.<br>
Such a system may determine the CIDs in advance for the media streams<br>
that are compressed/decompressed by the specific PDCP entity and the RTCP<br>
streams of the corresponding media. Therefore, the UE can resume the header<br>
decompression by using the old CID without correcting the old CID even when<br>
the new PDCP entity is established.<br>
In other words, the configuration of the PDCP entity and the header<br>
compressor/decompressor is determined in advance, simplifying the operation of<br>
the UE in reestablishing the PDCP entity and header decompressor when the UE<br>
moves between cells and the channel type is switched.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of resuming the MBMS for<br>
the UE moving between cells according to an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the UE determines if reestablishment is necessary<br>
(step 905). Herein, the UE can determine the reestablishment of header<br>
compression based on various factors as follows. For instance, when the UE<br>
detects a new cell with a different PDCP entity or when the channel type of the<br><br>
MBMS is switched. In step 910, the UE stores the old context information used<br>
in the header decompressor of the old PDCP entity. Later on, the old PDCP and<br>
the old header decompressor are discarded.<br>
In step 915, the UE establishes the new PDCP entity and feeds the old<br>
context information (decompression_context_x_old) to the new PDCP entity and<br>
header decompressor. In step 920, as descried above with reference to FIG 7, the<br>
UE sets the operating parameters of the old context information<br>
(decompression_context_x_old) with proper values.<br>
In step 925, the UE receives packet data from the new PDCP entity<br>
through the RLC layer. The packet data are PDCP PDU transferred to the PDCP<br>
layer of the UE from the RLC layer of the UE. In step 930, the UE checks<br>
whether the PDCP PDU is the IR-DYN packet. If the PDCP PDU is the IR-DYN<br>
packet, step 945 is performed. Otherwise, step 935 is performedand the UE stores<br>
the PDCP PDU and returns to step 925. That is, the PDCP PDUs received while<br>
waiting for the IR-DYN packet, are stored in the UE for the decompression. At<br>
this time, the UE can discard the PDCP PDUs, if they are not necessary.<br>
In step 945, the UE updates the dynamic part of the old context<br>
information (decompression_context_x_old) by using the IR-DYN packet,<br>
thereby forming the new context (decompression_context_x_new). At this time,<br>
the CID of the old context information does not have to be corrected. This is<br>
because the CID of the old compression context used in the old cell is identical to<br>
the CID of the compression context used in the new cell. Accordingly, in step 950,<br>
the UE resumes header decompression with the new PDCP entity and the new<br>
context (decompression_context_x_new). At this time, if the UE has PDCP<br>
PDUs stored for decompression, the PDCP PDUs are decompressed according to<br>
the new context (decompression context x new).<br>
As described above, if the pre-configuration information for the PDCP<br>
entity and the header compressor/decompressor is used, the old PDCP entity can<br>
be reused without reestablishing the PDCP entity even if the UE moves between<br>
 cells or the channel type is switched. FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating a<br><br>
procedure of reusing the old PDCP entity in the UE according to a further<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, in step 1005, the UE determines if reestablishment<br>
of header compression is necessary when the UE moves into a new cell or the<br>
channel type is switched. In step 1020, as descried above with reference to FIG. 7,<br>
the UE sets the operating parameters of the old context used in the old PDCP<br>
entity with proper values. That is, D_MODE is set to U, DSTATE is set to<br>
STATIC CONTEXT, and DTRANS is set to DONE.<br>
In step 1025, the UE receives the PDCP PDU from the new cell through<br>
the lower layer. In step 1030, the UE checks whether the PDCP PDU is the IR-<br>
DYN packet. If the PDCP PDU is the IR-DYN packet, step 1045 is carried out.<br>
Otherwise, step 1035 is performed and the UE stores or discards the PDCP PDU<br>
and returns to step 1025.<br>
In step 1045, the PDCP entity updates the dynamic part of the above<br>
context by using the IR-DYN packet. When the operating parameters have been<br>
reestablished and the dynamic part has been updated, the UE resumes the header<br>
decompression with the updated context (step 1050).<br>
The present invention having the above construction and operation has<br>
the following representative advantages.<br>
The UE establishes a new PDCP entity while reestablishing the radio<br>
bearer so as to transfer the old context information to the new PDCP entity. Since<br>
the new PDCP entity utilizes the old context information through the operating<br>
parameter establishment/CID correction/dynamic part update, an initializing<br>
procedure is not necessary. Thus, the present invention can rapidly resume header<br>
decompression when establishing a new PDCP entity.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
