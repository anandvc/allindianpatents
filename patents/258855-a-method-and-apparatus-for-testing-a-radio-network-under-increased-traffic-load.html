FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a system for testing cellular radio communication<br>
networks, and in particular, the performance of such networks under increased load.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
The rapid, world-wide expansion of cellular networks and the introduction of<br>
new wireless services combined with competition among network operators has meant an<br>
ever-increasing need for continuous improvement as to quality, capacity, and accessibility.<br>
From the network operator perspective, higher quality, increased capacity, and better<br>
accessibility must be provided while also keeping the cost of calls and other services as low<br>
as possible. Moreover, to allow for future traffic growth and the introduction of new<br>
services, major investments in network equipment and functionality are typically necessary.<br>
This new equipment and functionality must be verified in realistic circumstances before being<br>
deployed commercially. Even with equipment and functionality already in place, it is<br>
important that operators can obtain a "proof of performance" with the possibility to identify<br>
and remedy problem areas before the higher loads and/or new services exist in commercial<br>
operation.<br>
Consequently, operators are particularly interested in obtaining information<br>
regarding the likely performance of a particular network under increased load conditions in<br>
which a greater percentage of the available radio resources is being used. For example, a<br>
network operator may want proof or demonstration regarding whether and how well an<br>
existing site configuration can provide additional service(s). But accurately providing this<br>
kind of information is difficult, particularly if there are insufficient users available to load<br>
those sites to the increased level desired and/or there is insufficient hardware currently<br>
installed at the sites to support the higher traffic load.<br>
To test the capacity of a particular network or site configuration that includes a<br>
plurality of sites and/or sectors, the traffic could be increased by simply increasing the<br>
number of people making calls in the test area, assuming that there is sufficient installed<br>
equipment to handle the higher load. But this kind of manual loading process is time-<br>
consuming and expensive and requires that a large number of people be employed and sent<br>
out to load up the network with calls. Another problem with the manual loading approach is<br><br>
that it is difficult to ensure that these newly-added test users mimic the behavior of real traffic<br>
loading since they are being asked to make "artificial" test calls. Their mobility patterns and<br>
cellular phone usage may significantly differ from those of real users, thereby raising doubts<br>
about the accuracy of the system performance results so obtained.<br>
An alternative approach to increase the effective load on the network test area<br>
would be to increase the radio resource burden of each existing user, for example, by<br>
disabling power control and/or discontinuous transmission (DTX). Since features such as<br>
power control and DTX reduce the power transmitted by each user, disabling them is<br>
equivalent to adding more users manually in terms of the traffic load level in the network.<br>
An advantage with this method over the manual loading technique is that the drawbacks<br>
regarding time, cost, organization, and accuracy of results outlined above are avoided. A<br>
disadvantage, however, is that the gain from features like power control and DTX is typically<br>
difficult to quantify in practical situations, and therefore, the effective load on the network<br>
achieved by disabling these features is uncertain.<br>
A better loading approach to increase the effective load on the network test<br>
area is to reduce the number of available radio resources. Traffic load is typically distributed<br>
onto a limited amount or number of radio resources. For example, in the context of a radio<br>
communications network that employs time division multiple access (TDMA) technology,<br>
the radio resources include time slots and frequencies. If the same number of users may only<br>
utilize a reduced quantity of radio resources, then the load on these radio resources is<br>
increased. If the radio resources in the system, e.g., time slots and frequencies in a TDMA<br>
system, are equivalent and independent, then the performance results obtained using the<br>
reduced, sub-set of radio resources can be extrapolated to give network performance<br>
measures for the full network resource situation at higher loads.<br>
A difficulty with reducing the amount or number of available radio resources<br>
in order to increase the effective load is that not all radio resources are equivalent and<br>
independent, which makes extrapolation of the test results uncertain. For example, frequency<br>
bandwidth is typically an important radio resource. But because multi-path fading is<br>
frequency-dependent, reducing the frequency bandwidth influences the ability of users to<br>
combat multi-path fading, which adversely affects performance. Hence, obtaining test results<br>
with a reduced frequency bandwidth suffers from the same uncertainties in extrapolation to<br>
overall network performance as those discussed above in the context of increasing the radio<br>
resource burden of each user, for example, by disabling power control and/or DTX.<br><br>
In the GSM TDMA system, users typically utilize frequency bandwidth by<br>
frequency hopping over multiple frequencies, each having 200kHz bandwidth. In a system<br>
that implements frequency hopping, like GSM, reducing the number of available radio<br>
resources might correspond to reducing the number of hopping frequencies. The result is that<br>
existing calls must be handled using the reduced number of frequencies, which increases the<br>
load on those remaining frequencies. A drawback with reducing the number of frequencies,<br>
particularly in a frequency hopping context, is that it adversely affects the ability to combat<br>
multi-path fading by reducing the frequency bandwidth used by a connection, as explained<br>
above. It also reduces the variation of radio quality within a radio block, which reduces<br>
decoding performance when significant channel coding is present, as is the case with GSM<br>
speech. Further, it reduces the interference averaging effect that allows the gains of some<br>
users, e.g. due to DTX, to benefit all users. Hence, increasing the effective load in a GSM<br>
network for test purposes by reducing the number of hopping frequencies has significant<br>
disadvantages because the radio environment experienced by the users is fundamentally<br>
altered in the process.<br>
In a frequency hopping GSM system, the effective load on the radio resources<br>
can be measured by the frequency load, which is defined as the served traffic (the number of<br>
users and their bandwidth requirements), divided by the number of hopping frequencies times<br>
the number of time slots. Since increasing the traffic via artificially adding more "test" users,<br>
via increasing the radio resource burden of the existing users, or via reducing the number of<br>
hopping frequencies all have disadvantages, a better way of increasing the load in a GSM<br>
system is to reduce the number of time slots in each frequency or frequency hopping channel<br>
group, for example, by blocking a predetermined number of time slots to traffic. Individual<br>
time slots are independent of the other time slots, and the radio environment experienced by<br>
the users is unaffected since the correct number of hopping frequencies is still used. By<br>
carefully selecting the number of time slots to be used, the frequency load can be increased<br>
without resulting in congestion to existing users. This is achieved by either ensuring that<br>
sufficient equipment is in place to prevent congestion in the frequency hopping channel<br>
group with the reduced number of time slots, or by creating an extra frequency or frequency<br>
hopping channel group with a full set of time slots that can serve users that would otherwise<br>
be denied access to the network. In GSM, such an extra frequency channel group may<br>
typically contain a non-frequency hopping, broadcast control channel (BCCH) frequency.<br><br>
This approach to increasing the effective load may be used in cellular<br>
networks that do not employ TDMA and/or frequency hopping. For example, the invention<br>
can be applied to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and related access<br>
techniques by limiting the time of use for one or more sub-channel frequencies, as well as to<br>
spread spectrum, code division multiple access (CDMA) based systems. In all radio resource<br>
access techniques, time is a common radio resource. If desired, the approach can also be<br>
combined with other mechanisms/techniques for increasing effective system load, such as<br>
(but not limited to) those outlined above.<br>
The reduced time slot approach may be used in a radio communication system<br>
that includes multiple service areas. Each service area is associated with a predetermined<br>
number or amount of radio communication resources. Each radio communication resource<br>
can be used for a prescribed period of time which can be set by one or more time units. An<br>
operator or other entity identifies a set of service areas to be tested at an increased effective<br>
load. A desired test level (e.g., increased traffic load) is determined, and a corresponding<br>
number of radio resource time units is determined to achieve the desired test level conditions.<br>
Use of radio communication resources in the determined one or more time units is blocked<br>
for a test period. Performance in each service area during the test period is determined, and<br>
thereafter, aggregated into overall test network statistics as deemed appropriate.<br>
The performance may be determined based on measures such as: dropped call<br>
rate, received signal strength, signal quality, interference, handover success rate, and bit and<br>
block error rates. Each time unit may correspond to a time slot or a time frame, and each<br>
radio resource may be associated with a frequency, a frequency range, or a frequency<br>
hopping group. Alternatively, if the radio communication system uses code division multiple<br>
access (CDMA), each radio resource may be associated with the code, and each time unit<br>
may correspond to a transmission time interval (TTI). In that case, the radio transmitters in<br>
the set of service areas transmit at an increased power level during unblocked TTIs and at a<br>
decreased power level during blocked TTIs.<br>
In an example embodiment, synchronous time units in all of the service areas<br>
being tested are blocked. Synchronous time units or time slots are preferentially chosen<br>
because interference from one service area typically affects performance in other service<br>
areas. If the effect of the increased effective load is to be registered equally across the<br>
network test area in the form of increased interference, the load must be concentrated to the<br>
same time unit(s) in all service areas.<br><br>
In practice, the blocking of exactly synchronous time units or time slots may<br>
not be possible. This could be the case, for example, if different service areas obtain their<br>
timing reference from different and independent transmission links. In asynchronous<br>
systems, time units or time slots as close to synchronous as possible should be blocked in the<br>
different service areas. Any non-alignment can then be corrected for in the effective load<br>
calculation. Such a correction is desirable since non-alignment reduces the interference<br>
experienced by the traffic in the network, and therefore, the actual effective load achieved<br>
during the test.<br>
In one non-limiting, example embodiment applied to a control node, a<br>
controller in that node controls plural radio base station units. The radio base station units<br>
may correspond to base station sites or to base station sectors. Once a set of service areas is<br>
specified for testing, one or more times in each service area is determined when one or more<br>
radio resources associated with each such service area will not be used. A performance<br>
measure is determined under those conditions. Another non-limiting, example embodiment<br>
is a computer program product that includes computer code operable to control a computer.<br>
That code may include first logic operable to determine a test set of service areas for testing,<br>
second logic operable to determine one or more times in each service area when one or more<br>
radio resources for each service area will not be used, and third logic operable to determine<br>
each service area's performance under those conditions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following description sets forth specific details, such as particular<br>
embodiments, procedures, techniques, etc., for purposes of explanation and not limitation.<br>
But it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be employed<br>
apart from these specific details. For example, although the following description makes<br>
reference to GSM-type radio resources, including time slots and frequency hopping, the<br>
invention may be employed in virtually any type of radio communication system in which<br>
time is a factor in allocating and using radio resources. In some instances, detailed<br>
descriptions of well-known methods, interfaces, circuits, etc., are omitted so as not to obscure<br>
the description with unnecessary detail. Moreover, individual blocks are shown in some of<br>
the figures. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks may be<br>
implemented using individual hardware circuits, using software program products in<br>
conjunction with a suitably-programmed microprocessor or other computer, using application<br>
specific circuitry (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a radio communication system comprised of multiple<br>
service areas, referred to here generically as "sites", including sites S1 through S12. The term<br>
"site" encompasses a cell, a radio base station, or a radio base station sector. An effective<br>
load/traffic capacity test is desired to be performed on a certain set of service areas. In the<br>
example in Figure 1, sites S1 through S12 are preferably all put under test conditions to<br>
determine the performance of sites S1-S3. That is why sites S1-S3 are referred to as first-tier<br>
sites, and sites S4-S12 are referred to as second-tier sites. The second-tier sites are tested to<br>
include their effects, e.g., interference, etc., on the first-tier sites. For purposes of this<br>
example only, the radio communication system is assumed to be a TDMA type system that<br>
supports frequency hopping between a number of hopping frequencies, with each frequency<br>
being divided into repeating frames of eight time slots TS0-TS7.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a time slot frame for each of sites S1-S3. In this case, the<br>
time slots are synchronized in time so that each time slot on each frequency starts and ends at<br>
the same time. In order to increase the frequency load to a predetermined value,<br>
communication using time slots TSO, TS1, and TS7 is blocked during a test period for each<br>
site S1-S1 2. The number of blocked time slots depends on the load level to be tested, and<br>
preferably, also takes into account the actual load currently being generated by subscribers.<br>
The load should be increased so that those subscribers do not detect congestion. Maintaining<br>
congestion at acceptable levels can be assured by installing sufficient equipment in the<br><br>
frequency hopping channel group with the reduced number of time slots, or by creating an<br>
extra frequency or frequency hopping channel group with enough time slots that can serve<br>
users that would otherwise be denied access to the network. As a result of blocking time slots<br>
TSO, TS1, and TS7, all of the traffic must be carried using only time slots TS2-TS6. This<br>
effectively increases the traffic load at each site S1-S12 and permits performance testing at<br>
sites S1-S3 under this increased load condition.<br>
Performance may be determined or measured in any suitable manner including<br>
(but not limited to) measuring a number of dropped calls, a dropped call rate, signal quality,<br>
signal strength, interference, bit or block error rates, delay, etc. Such performance indicators<br>
from each site are then aggregated into an overall network performance measure(s) as<br>
deemed appropriate by the operator. For example, a dropped call rate for sites S1-S3 and an<br>
average frequency load for sites S1-S12 may be calculated and compared to the operator-<br>
defined targets for traffic load and dropped call rate in the network. Furthermore, individual<br>
site data can be used to identify problem areas that require particular attention with respect to<br>
continued network optimization, site additions, equipment upgrades, and so on, in order for<br>
the operator to meet network capacity and performance targets.<br>
Conducting a similar performance test in an unsynchronized system is more<br>
complicated. Figure 3 shows such an unsynchronized system with the time slots for each of<br>
the sites S1-S3 being offset from each other. Time slots most closely aligned in each site are<br>
the best candidates for blocking. Exemplary time slots for blocking in this case are time slots<br>
TS5-TS7 for site S1, time slots TSO, TS1, and TS7 for site S2, and time slots TSO, TS6, and<br>
TS7 for site S3, as shown. In this way, the traffic load may be concentrated in five time slots<br>
in each of the sites that are as close to synchronous as possible, although they have different<br>
time slot numbers in the repeating frame structure of each site. The corresponding time slots<br>
in the second tier sites S4-S12 that are closely aligned to the blocked time slots in the first tier<br>
sites S1-S3 are also blocked. As with the synchronized case, the number of time slots<br>
blocked may be balanced with other factors such as avoiding congestion for active<br>
subscribers in the network and maintaining reasonable quality of service, in addition to the<br>
primary aim of reaching a target effective load for network testing.<br>
In order to ascertain the relative timing offsets of sites in an unsynchronized<br>
system, timing measurements must be performed, typically by using a test mobile station to<br>
register timing synchronization information broadcast by each site. This timing information<br>
for each site can be compared to determine offsets between the time slots at each of the sites,<br><br>
and thereby, which time slot numbers should be blocked in each site to achieve close to<br>
synchronous time slot blocking across the test area as desired.<br>
The frequency load of sites S1-S12 determined in an unsynchronized setting is<br>
preferably corrected for the lack of synchronization between time slots in the different sites.<br>
Such a correction is desirable since unaligned time slots reduce the interference experienced<br>
by traffic in the unblocked time slots, and therefore, the actual effective load achieved during<br>
a test period.<br>
One non-limiting, example way in which the measurements in an<br>
unsynchronized application may be corrected is now described. The maximum offset<br>
between corresponding blocked time slots in an arbitrary site and the chosen reference site is<br>
plus or minus one-half a time slot, if the time slots to block have been chosen to minimize<br>
their non-alignment. Hence, the maximum offset between any arbitrary site pair in the set is<br>
one time slot. A correction can be applied to the calculated frequency load based on a fixed,<br>
average timing offset in the site set. For example, it can be shown that the average timing<br>
offset between an arbitrary site pair with independent random offsets from the reference site<br>
in the range of-0.5 time slots to +0.5 time slots is 0.333 (one-third) time slots. Assume now<br>
as an example that two time slots in each site should be blocked in order to achieve the<br>
desired frequency load for the network test. The frequency load carried by sites with six<br>
unblocked time slots may then be reduced by a factor 0.333/6 when calculating the effective<br>
frequency load. This factor corresponds to the relative amount of traffic in the site that, on<br>
average, does not contribute to interference in the other sites.<br>
In some cases, in both synchronized and unsynchronized systems, it may be<br>
necessary to block fewer than the desired number of time slots in certain sites, for example, in<br>
order to prevent congestion if sufficient equipment to cater for the higher effective load has<br>
not been able to be installed. No correction is necessary for sites with fewer than the<br>
maximum number of blocked time slots. This is because the additional unblocked time<br>
slot(s) can always be chosen so as to cover the offset to other sites that is at most one full<br>
time slot, as explained above. As a result, there is no interference reduction to the core set of<br>
unblocked time slots, i.e., those common to all sites, whose performance is to be evaluated.<br>
By way of illustration, consider the following, non-limiting, frequency-load<br>
formulas for a scenario where two time slots have been blocked. In sites with eight<br>
unblocked time slots:<br>
frequency load (FL) = Erlang/ (6 * 8).<br><br>
In sites with seven unblocked time slots:<br>
FL = Erlang/ (6 * 7)<br>
In sites with six unblocked time slots:<br>
FL = (1 -0.333/6)* Erlang/ (6 * 6)<br>
The total frequency load in the set of test sites is as follows:<br>
FL (total) = (Σ FL in all sites in the set)/(number of sites in the set).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example, non-limiting set of procedures for<br>
implementing site testing under increased effective load. A set of multiple service areas<br>
(MSAs) is determined for testing (step S1). In the example above, that testing is conducted in<br>
the context of increased frequency load. Again, a service area may be a site, a sector, a cell,<br>
or any other type of area. Based on the desired test load and the current load in the service<br>
areas, the number of time slots in each service area to be blocked during the test period is<br>
determined, preferably also ensuring that congestion can be avoided (step S2).<br>
If the service areas are not synchronized, the timing signals broadcast from<br>
each service area are measured, for example, by using a roaming mobile "test" receiver. That<br>
timing and time slot number information is conveyed to a control node for later use in<br>
identifying the time slots to be blocked in the service areas and in correcting the effective<br>
load for any time slot non-alignment. If the service areas are synchronized, the control node<br>
typically already knows the timing and time slot number information. Otherwise, it can<br>
obtain the information directly from the radio base station associated with that service area<br>
(step S3).<br>
Based on the timing and time slot number information and the number of time<br>
slots to be blocked from step S2, a determination can be made as to which time slots are<br>
synchronous and should be blocked in all of the mobile service areas, or in an<br>
unsynchronized context, which time slots are the most closely-aligned and should be blocked,<br>
using the timing information from an arbitrary service area as a reference (step S4). Those<br>
time slots identified in step S4 are blocked (step S5). Performance is then measured or<br>
otherwise determined under the increased load condition with certain time slots blocked. For<br>
unsynchronized systems, the effective load is corrected to compensate for unaligned time<br>
slots (step S6).<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a controller node 10 that includes a CPU 12 and a memory<br>
14 with a program that stores logic code to implement the steps illustrated, for example, in<br>
Figure 4. Of course, other steps and procedures may be coded to implement the claimed<br><br>
invention. The controller 10 in Figure 5 is coupled to each of the sites S1-S12, consistent<br>
with the sites shown in the two tier structure of Figure 1, where sites S1-S3 are first-tier sites<br>
and sites S4-S12 are second-tier sites. Although each radio resource may also be associated<br>
with a frequency, frequency range, or frequency hopping group, such as illustrated in Figures<br>
2 and 3 in the context of a TDMA-type system, the radio resource may also correspond, for<br>
example, to a spreading code like those used in a code division multiple access system. In a<br>
CDMA system, each time unit then corresponds to a transmission time interval (TTI).<br>
Reference is made to Figures 6A and 6B which illustrate the transmission<br>
power in a particular site in Figure 6. Figure 6A is a graph that shows a normal transmission<br>
situation in which the power level (normalized to "1") is consistent over consecutive TTIs.<br>
However, to test the capacity of the system, signals may be transmitted in a "compressed<br>
mode," an example of which is illustrated in Figure 6B. The transmitters in each site being<br>
tested transmit at twice the power during a first transmission time interval, but at zero power<br>
in the following second TTI. This pattern effectively doubles the load in the service area<br>
during alternating TTIs, and the performance of the system can be measured during those<br>
increased transmit power TTIs. Of course, the power may be increased by something other<br>
than twice (either more or less), during the first TTI, and the power during the second TTI<br>
may be something more than zero. Also, both the higher and lower power periods may<br>
extend for more than one TTI, and they need not extend for an equal number of TTIs. As<br>
these figures illustrate, an important radio resource in a CDMA system is transmission power,<br>
which is allocated with spreading codes. Here, the time unit being blocked corresponds to<br>
alternating TTIs which results in increased traffic load during the other TTIs.<br>
There may be situations in which it is desirable to use the time unit/slot<br>
blocking approach in addition to one or more other load increasing strategies. Such other<br>
strategies might include (but are not limited to) decreasing a number of frequencies for use,<br>
increasing a number of mobile users, turning off discontinuous transmission (DTX), turning<br>
off power control, etc. A combination of loading methods may be desirable when the target<br>
effective load for testing is far greater than the current load in the test area. Many time slots<br>
must then be blocked to achieve the requisite load, which makes congestion harder to avoid<br>
in practice since significant additional equipment beyond that required for the current<br>
network load must be in place to do so. A combination of loading techniques may then<br>
become a more feasible alternative.<br><br>
The time unit blocking approach to increasing the effective load may be used<br>
with other cellular network technologies than those based on TDMA and CDMA, because<br>
time is always an important resource. For example, in orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing (OFDM) and related access techniques, the time of use for one or more sub-<br>
channel frequencies, so-called tones, can be limited in order to increase the effective system<br>
load. With the primary radio resources being frequency and time, OFDM systems bear<br>
strong similarities in this context to the TDMA based systems like GSM discussed in detail<br>
above.<br>
The time unit blocking approach achieves numerous advantages over other<br>
techniques. First, the operator can test the network under increased effective load conditions<br>
without having to manually add extra users to the network, which saves time and money and<br>
gives truly representative performance results. Second, the operator can maintain the true<br>
radio resource burden of the users without having to disable features like power control and<br>
DTX in order to achieve an increased effective load whose magnitude is then difficult to<br>
quantify. Third, the operator can increase the effective system load without changing the<br>
radio environment for the users, which would be the case if the frequency bandwidth and/or<br>
the number of hopping frequencies were reduced, thereby ensuring representative<br>
performance results. Fourth, congestion can be avoided by ensuring that sufficient equipment<br>
is installed, by creating an extra channel group containing a full set of time units to support<br>
users that would otherwise be denied access to the network, by blocking fewer than the<br>
maximum number of time units in certain sites where congestion is otherwise deemed likely,<br>
or by some combination of the above. Fifth, the time unit blocking approach can be<br>
combined with other techniques for increasing the effective system load if desired. Sixth, the<br>
time unit blocking approach works in principle for all cellular network technologies because<br>
time is always a key resource. Seventh, the time unit blocking approach is applicable in both<br>
synchronous and asynchronous cellular systems. Eighth, the time unit blocking approach is<br>
easily implemented and operated in a control node in which the test preparations, the test<br>
itself, and the subsequent results analysis, both on a network and local site level, can be<br>
performed with minimal impact to normal network operations.<br>
While practical and preferred implementations of example embodiments have<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING A RADIO NETWORK UNDER<br>
INCREASED TRAFFIC LOAD<br>
In a radio communication system that includes multiple service areas (SAs), each<br>
service area (SA) is associated with a predetermined number or amount of radio<br>
communication resources. Each radio communication resource can be used for a prescribed<br>
period of time corresponding to one or more time units. An operator or other entity<br>
identifies (S1) a set of service areas to be tested at an increased effective load. A desired<br>
test level (e.g., increased traffic load) is determined (S2), and a corresponding number of<br>
radio resource time units is determined to achieve the desired test level conditions (S3 and<br>
S4). Use of radio communication resources in the determined one or more time units is<br>
blocked (S5) for a test period. Performance by each service area during the test period is<br>
determined (S6).</td>
