				<td>The present invention relates to a motorcycle in which an engine is suspended on a vehicle body frame assembly including a main frame extending in a rearward declined manner from a head pipe and is disposed below the main frame; an air cleaner and a carburetor are disposed above the engine; and a fuel cock of a negative pressure operated type operated by an exhaust negative pressure in the engine is incorporated in an intermediate portion ?f a fuel supply line which connects a fuel tank disposed below i riding seat supported at a rear portion of the vehicle body frame assembly and the carburetor to each other, and particularly, the present invention relates an improvement in a fuel cock-mounting structure. (ACKGROUND ART<br>
Such a motorcycle is conventionally known, for example, from Japanese Patent Publication No.7-106711. In this lotorcycle, a fuel cock of a negative pressure operated type, hich is mounted between a fuel tank disposed below a riding eat and a carburetor disposed in front of and below the fuel ank, is disposed below the fuel tank and mounted to the fuel ank.<br>
In the conventional known motorcycle, however, the fuel ock is disposed at a location spaced apart from the carburetor<br><br>
and hence, a negative pressure take-off line for taking off a negative pressure from an intake device including the carburetor and conducting it to the fuel cock is prolonged, and moreover, the length of a line section of the fuel supply line, which connects the carburetor and the fuel cock to each other, is also increased. Therefore, when air enters the fuel supply line with the stoppage of the supplying of fuel from the fuel tank, a lot of time is taken to exchange the air and the fuel in the fuel supply line during subsequent supplying of the fuel, and a relief valve or the like for withdrawal of the air is required.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished with such sircumstanceslnview, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel cock-mounting structure in a motorcycle, therein the negative pressure take-off line between the intake levice and the fuel cock can be shortened and moreover, an sxclusive part for withdrawing the air from the fuel supply line .s not required to enable a reduction in number of parts. 1ISCL0SURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the above object, according to a first aspect tnd feature of the present invention, there is provided a fuel :ock-mountlng structure In a motorcycle, the motorcycle lomprising an engine suspended on a vehicle body frame assembly ncluding a main frame extending in a rearward declined manner rom a head pipe, the engine being disposed below the main frame; n air cleaner and a carburetor disposed above the engine; and fuel cock of a negative pressure operated type operated by<br><br>
an intake negative pressure in the engine, the fuel cock being incorporated in an intermediate portion of a fuel supply line which connects a fuel tank disposed below a riding seat supported at a rear portion of the vehicle body frame assembly and the carburetor to each other, the fuel cock-mounting structure feeing characterized in that the fuel cock incorporated in an Intermediate portion of the fuel supply line extending in a forward declined manner from the fuel tank and connected to the carburetor is mounted to an intake pipe which connects the carburetor and the engine to each other.<br>
With such arrangement of the first feature, the fuel cock can be mounted in proximity to the carburetor and hence, the negative pressure take-off line for conducting the negative pressure from the Intake device to the fuel cock can be shortened, and a line section of the fuel supply line which connects the carburetor and the fuel cock to each other can be shortened. Moreover, the fuel supply line connecting the fuel tank and the carburetor to each other is arranged in the forward inclined manner. Therefore, even if air enters the line section with the stoppage of the supplying of fuel from the fuel tank, the fuel can be filled quickly in the entire fuel supply line during subsequent supplying of the fuel, even if an air-withdrawing operation is omitted. Thus, it is possible to quickly supply the fuel to the carburetor, while eliminating the need for a part such as a relief valve for withdrawing the air to enable a reduction in number of parts.<br><br>
According to a second aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to the arrangement of the first feature, the fuel cock is mounted to a mounting stay integrally provided on the intake pipe. With such arrangement, the fuel cock is mounted to the intake pipe of the intake device and hence, the degree of freedom for disposition of the fuel cock can be increased, as compared with a case where a fuel cock is mounted to a fuel tank.<br>
According to a third aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to the arrangement of the first feature, the fuel cock is disposed on a side opposite from the carburetor with respect to the main frame. With such arrangement, it is possible to easily arrange the fuel supply line and the negative pressure take-off line. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

In other words, the fuel cock 90 is mounted to the intake pipe 39. In a state in which the fuel cock 90 has been mounted to the intake pipe 39 in this manner, the fuel cock 90 is disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 below the main frame 13 and on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the main frame 13.<br>
A bleed air supply line 105 for conducting bleed air to the carburetor 38 is mounted between the air cleaner 37 and the carburetor 38, and a bleed air cleaner 106 is mounted in an Intermediate portion of the bleed air supply line 105, so that it is disposed above the secondary air cleaner 79.<br>
The operation of the present embodiment will be described below. The secondary air control valve 48 for controlling the supplying of the exhaust secondary air to the exhaust port 44 in the engine E disposed below the main frame 13 with the cylinder axis CI inclined forwards is disposed the carburetor 38 of the intake device 40 disposed above the engine E and the cell motor 50 mounted to the upper portion of the engine E and between the engine E and the main frame 13.<br>
Therefore, the secondary air control valve 48 can be disposed effectively in a space created between the engine E<br><br>
having the cylinder axis CI Inclined forwards and the main frame 13 and between the carburetor 38 and the cell motor 50, respectively. Moreover, the secondary air control valve 48 is disposed in the vicinity of the engine E and hence, the secondary air supply line 86 connecting the secondary air control valve 48 and the exhaust port 44 in the engine E to each other can be shortened.<br>
The secondary air cleaner 79 connected to the secondary air control valve 48 at a location upstream of the secondary air control valve 48 is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the centerline C2 passing through the wldthwlse center of the main frame 13, and the carburetor 38 and the secondary air cleaner 79 can be disposed effectively in the narrow space between the engine E and the main frame 13, so that they are disposed at locations displaced in a widthwise direction of the vehicle body frame assembly F.<br>
Further, since most of the secondary air supply line 86 is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the centerline C2 passing through the widthwise center of the main frame 13, the carburetor 38 and the secondary air supply line 86 can be disposed compactly at locations closer to the main frame 13.<br>
Yet further, the fuel cock 90 of the negative pressure operated type incorporated in an intermediate portion of the fuel supply line 88 for supplying fuel to the carburetor 48 is disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 below<br><br>
the main frame 13 and disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 disposed between the carburetor 38 and the cell motor 50. Therefore, the fuel cock 90 can be disposed In proximity to the carburetor 38, and the negative pressure take-off line 100 for conducting the negative pressure from the intake device 40 to the fuel cock 90 can be shortened.<br>
Since the fuel cock 90 Is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the main frame 13, it is possible to facilitate the arrangement of the fuel supply line 88 and the negative pressure take-off line 100.<br>
Moreover, since the fuel cock 90 is incorporated in an intermediate portion of the fuel supply line 88 extending forwards and downwards from the fuel tank 25 and connected to the carburetor 38, even if the air enters the line section 88b of the fuel supply line 88 connecting the carburetor 38 and the fuel cock 90 to each other with the stoppage of the supplying of the fuel from the fuel tank 25, the fuel can be filled quickly into the line section 88b during subsequent supplying of the fuel, even if an operation for withdrawing the air from the line section 88b is omitted. Thus, it is possible to quickly supply the fuel to the carburetor 38, while eliminating the need for a part such as a relief valve for withdrawing the air to enable a reduction in number of parts.<br>
Further, since the fuel cock 90 is mounted to the intake pipe 39 of the intake device 40, the degree of freedom for the disposition of the fuel cock 90 can be increased, as compared<br><br>
with a system in which a fuel cock 90 is mounted to a fuel tank 25.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications in design may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined In claims.<br>
