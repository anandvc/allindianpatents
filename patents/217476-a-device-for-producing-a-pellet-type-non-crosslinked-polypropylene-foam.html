Polypropylene foam having a melting point of 125 °C to 140 °C, a process for producing said foam, a device for realizing said process and an article molded from said foam<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Due to its excellent mechanical strength and cushioning properties, a polypropylene resin foam is widely used as a packaging material, a building material, a heat shield material and the like. However, since polypropylene has a high crystallinity and a low melt viscosity and is difficult to cross-link, it has hereto been quite difficult to obtain a highly expanded product from the polypropylene.<br>
US patent No. 5,527,573 (issued June 18, 1996) discloses extruded closed-cell polypropylene resin foam and several methods for producing said foam. The foam of the US patent is in a plank form and has a minimal cross-sectional area of about 5 x 2.54 square centimeters, a minimal thickness of 12.7 millimeters and a density of about 5 pounds per a cubic foot. The form and properties make it difficult to mold the foam into desired shaped articles. US patent No. 6,051.617 (issued April 19, 2000) discloses a foamed polypropylene resin particle useful for molding a foamed, molded article and a method of preparing the same. However, the foamed polypropylene resin particle is prepared by grafting a vinyl comonomer to polypropylene resin particles to form the modified copolymer resin particles and foaming the modified copolymer resin particles<br>
US patent No 6,077,875 (issued June 20, 2000) discloses foamed and expanded beads of a polypropylene resin for molding prepared from a non-cross linked propylene-ethylene random copolymer The foamed beads of the US patent has an open cell content of at most 40%, most preferably 25% and has a melting point of at least 141 ..<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
A non-crosslinked polypropylene resin is advantageous as it can be recycled and the pellet-type foam produced from the resin can be easily molded. However, the pellet-type foam obtained through extrusion of the non-crosslinked polypropylene resin contains open cells to no small extent and thus is useless.

Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a pellet-type polypropylene resin foam with a melting point of 1401) or less which is produced from a non-crosslinked polypropylene resin to ensure a recyclability, has a high content of closed cells to provide a satisfactory mechanical strength and can be molded into various shaped packaging materials, and a method for producing the same The inventors have successfully produced 'pellet-type foams of non-crosslinked polypropylene with a melting point of 125 to 140'C, which comprises about at least 40% of closed cells by providing a tandem   extruder  with  a  plurality  of temperature  zones  having  specifically  varied<br>
temperatures, making the non-crosslinked propylene resin melt having a melting point ol 118 to 140°C flow through the temperature zones, mechanically homogenizing the polypropylene resin melt passed through such zones at a lower temperature of 120 to 130V, expanding the homogenized melt through a plurality of holes formed in the dies under pressure, and cutting expanded foams discharged from the holes of the dies<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to the present invention, it has been impossible to prepare pellet-type foams having a melting point of 140 °C or less. Pure polypropylene whose melting point is 138°C could not be processed at a temperature of 138"C or less, since it would be cured<br>
rapidly at its melting point or less Thus, it has been also considered as being impossible to prepare pellet-type foams having a melting point of 140 °C  or less<br>
However, the inventors have developed the pellet-type non-crosslinked polypropylene foams which have a melting point of 140 °C or less and an open cell content of about 20% or less Such pellet-type foams have been developed by combination and application of a number of discoveries For example, the inventors have found that the content of open cells in foams can be remarkably decreased by using a tandem extruding method as a basis, setting specific temperature conditions for the first and second extruding process, and homogenizing the melt resulting from the extruder at a lower temperature of 125 to 130°C Also, the inventors have found that only when the temperature during the extrusion and expansion of the non-crosslinked polypropylene resin having a melting point of 138 to 140 °C is kept within a specific temperature range, closed cells of 80% or more can be formed. Further, the inventor have found that a melting point of the foams prepared from the non-crosslinked polypropylene resin having a melting point of 138 to 140°C can be lowered to 138°C or less by the specific working conditions according to the present invention.<br>
Now, the method for preparing the pellet type foams of non-crosslinked polypropylene according to the present invention will be described in detail. The manufacturing method of the present invention comprises extruding, pumping, homogenizing, expanding and pelletizing steps.<br>
(1) Extruding<br>
An extruding process according to the present invention can be performed by using a tandem extruder that is commonly used and well known in the art for preparing foams as a basis or its variation.   Materials used for preparing the pellet type foams of<br><br>
non-crosslinked polypropylene according to the present invention comprises a non-crosslinked polypropylene random copolymer having a melting point of 138 to 140°C a nucleating agent, a foaming agent and an additive, if necessary<br>
The basic resin of the present invention is the non-crosslinked propylene random copolymer having a melting point of 138 to 140'C Examples of other comonomer copolymerizable with propylene include ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentent and 1-hexene The propylene random copolymer can be bipolymers such as propylene-ethylene random copolymer or propylene-butene random copolymer or terpolymers such as propylene-ethylene-butene copolymer. The ratio of pther comonomer component other than propylene in the copolymer is preferably 0.05 to 10 % by weight.<br>
The nucleating agent functions to disperse a foaming agent and adjust the cell size of the foams. Examples of the nucleating agent which can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is preferred. The more amount of the used nucleating agent is, the smaller the cell size of the foams is. On contrary, the less amount of the used nucleating agent is, the larger the cell size of the foams is. In the present invention, the nucleating agent of 0.1 to 0.4% based on the weight of a resin is used. When the amount of the used nucleating agent exceeds 0.4%, insufficient dispersion or agglomeration can occur, and as a result, the cell grows larger than a predetermined size. On the contrary, when the amount of the used nucleating agent is 0.1% or less, the nucleation activity is excessively weak, whereby the cell diameter can not be reduced.<br>
As a usable foaming agent in the present invention, there are organic foaming agents and inorganic foaming agents. Examples of the organic foaming agent are aliphatic   hydrocarbons   such   as   propane,   butane,   hexane   and   heptane,   alicychc<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclobutane and cyclopentane, and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorofluorometnae, trifluorometane, 1,1-difluoroetnae, 1,2,2,2-tetrafiuoroetane, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride and methylene chloride Also, usable organic foaming agents include dichlorotetrafluoroethane, trichlorotnfluoroethane, trichloromonofluoromethane, dichlorodifiuoromethane, dichloromonofluorornethane and dibromotetrafluoroethane Considering forming workability, nontoxicity and flame retardancy, these fluoro-chlonnated hydroncarbon are preferable These organic foaming agents can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof Examples of the inorganic foaming agent include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon and air These inorganic foaming agents can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. Also, any mixtures of randomly selected two or more of the organic foaming agents and the inorganic foaming argents can be used The most preferred foaming argent is an inorganic foaming agent since they do not destroy an ozonosphere and are inexpensive. The used amount of the foaming agents depends upon the expansion ratio of the foam pellet to be obtained and the type of the used resin and foaming agent. The amount of the foaming agent used in the present invention is about 20% to 30% by weight, based on the weight of the resin<br>
In addition, various kinds of additives can be used. Examples of such additives include an antioxidant, UV absorber, flame retardant, coloring agent, dye, metal deactivator and the like. These additives can be used in an amount of 0 1 to 0 3% by-weight, based on the weight of the copolymer resin. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, paraffin wax is used. This helps the copolymer resin to flow and acts as an antistatic agent to remove static electricity of the copolymer resm. The used amount of paraffin wax is about 0.1% by weight<br>
The above materials used in the present invention are extruded by the tandem extruder in which a specific physical condition is set according to the present invention and<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclobutane and cyclopentane, and halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorofiuorometnae. trifluorometane, 1,1-aifluoloetnae. 1,2,2.2-tetrafluoroetane. methyl chloride, ethyl chloride and methylene chloride Also, usable organic foaming agents include dichlorotetrafluoroethane. trichlorotnfluoroethane, trichloromonofluoromethane. di-hlorodifluoromethane, dichloromonofluoromethane and dibromotetrafluoroethane Considering forming workability, nontoxicity and flame retardancy, these fluorc-chlorinated hydroncarbon are preferable. These organic foaming agents can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof Examples of the inorganic foaming agent include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon and air. These inorganic foaming agents can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. Also, any mixtures of randomly selected two or more of the organic foaming agents and the inorganic foaming argents can be used. The most preferred foaming argent is an inorganic foaming agent since they do not destroy an ozonosphere and are inexpensive. The used amount of the foaming agents depends upon the expansion ratio of the foam pellet to be obtained and the type of the used resin and foaming agent. The amount of the foaming agent used m the present invention is about 0.1% to 0.4% by weight, based on the weight of the resin.<br>
In addition, various kinds of additives can be used. Examples of such additives include an antioxidant, UV absorber, flame retardant, coloring agent, dye, metal deactivator and the like. These additives can be used in an amount of 0.1 to 0 3% by weight, based on the weight of the copolymer resin. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, paraffin wax is used. This helps the copolymer resin to flow and acts as an antistatic agent to remove static electricity of the copolymer resin. The used amount of paraffin wax is about 0.l % by weight.<br>
the above materials used in the present invention are extruded by the tandem extruder in which a specific physical condition is set according to the present invention and<br>
the process will be described as follows The tandem extrudei is consisted of ft first extruder, a second extruder and a guide connecting the first and second extruders A screw compression ratio is generally 3 1 Usually, the inner diameter of a cylinder of the first extruder is about 60 to 70mm. The inner diameter of a cylinder of the second extruder is normally about 90 to 95mm.<br>
The first extruder is divided into six zones according to their temperatures, each zone corresponds to 300 to 400LD. The six zones are a first temperature zone of 148 to 153°C, a second temperature zone of 167 to 172°C, a third temperature zone of 167 to 172°C, a fourth temperature zone of 218 to 223 °C, a fifth temperature zone of 197 to 203 °C, and a sixth temperature zone of 188 to 193 °C.<br>
The non-crosslinked polypropylene random copolymer resin and the nucleating agent are supplied at a constant speed through a hopper and then melted in the first temperature zone in which a temperature of 148 to 153 °C is set. The flowing speed can be adjusted by a rotating speed of the screw and is normally about 20 to 30 rpm. Such rotating speed of the screw determines an inflow speed of row material and a flow speed of melt. In this case, an inflow speed of the resin is about 25 km/hour. Though the copolymer resin and the nucleating agent can be supplied through one hopper at the same time, it is preferable that they are supplied independently via individual hoppers. The second and third temperature zones are maintained at a temperature of 167 to 172°C, other additives such as paraffin wax are introduced to an starting point of the third temperature zone. The paraffin wax is pumped to be introduced after it is melted. Also, the temperature of the fourth temperature zone is set to 218 to 223 V and a foaming agent is supplied to an starting point of the fourth temperature zone by pumping operation. The melt from the fourth temperature zone is passed through the fifth temperature zone in which a temperature of 218 to 223 "C is set and then introduced to the sixth temperature<br>
7one in which a temperature of 188 to 193 °C  is set<br>
The melt from the sixth temperature zone of the first extruder is introduced to the second extruder through the guide connecting the first and second extruders Here, the temperature of the guide is set to 248 to 255 °C  and LD of the guide is 300 to 400mm<br>
The second extruder is also divided into six zones according to a temperature, each zone corresponds to 470 to 520mm The six zones are a first temperature zone of 168 to 173 °C, a second temperature zone of 147 to 152 °C, a third temperature zone of 143 to 147°C, a fourth temperature zone of 137 to 142°C, a fifth temperature zone of 137 to 142°C, and a sixth temperature zone of 132 to 137°C A screw speed of the second extruder is normally 8 to 12 rpm.<br>
Each zone in the first and second extruders can be maintained at a specifically set temperature by means of any one of water-cooled type, oil-cooled type and air-cooled type method. Among them, the water-cooled method that adjusts a temperature using water pressure is preferable. For example, a water cooled type device can be used, which has a cooling water body which is formed in a hollow shape, so that it can be mounted around the cylinder of the extruder and the cylinder is inserted therein, and is provided with a cooling water passage formed integrally with the body, so that cooling water is contacted directly with the surface of the cylinder.<br>
(2) Pumping<br>
The sixth temperature zone of the second extruder can correspond to a flange for connecting a means for crushing the melt according to a method of the present invention. Since the temperature-of this flange is maintained peculiarly at 132 to 137 "C by the present invention and this temperature is lower than the melting point of 138 °C of the polypropylene resin, an flowing speed of the melt can be remarkably lowered.   Thus,<br>
there is need for forcibly flowing the melt so that it can move smoothly Such compulsory flow can be achieved by means of a pump. At this time, the temperature is maintained at 125 to 138 °C by the water-cooled type device.<br>
(3)	Homogenizing<br>
According to the present invention, the melt transferred from the extruder by pumping at a temperature of 125 to 140°C is homogenized at a temperature of 120 to 130 °C. Here, to homogenize means that the melt is cut and ground at the same time in a manner of grinding stones. Also, through homogenization, the melt becomes to have a uniform temperature in the inner portion and outer portion.

C. Pumping part 300<br>
The polypropylene melt at a temperature of 135 °C discharged from the second extruder 200 is supplied to the pumping part 300. Since the melting point of the polypropylene is 138 °C, the polypropylene melt discharged from the second extruder 200 has been considerably reduced in its flowing speed. In the present invention, the pumping part 300 is used for moving compulsorily such polypropylene melt to a subsequent process<br>
FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing the inner structure of the pumping part 300 and homogenizing part 400 shown in FIG. 1. The left side shows the inner structure of the pumping part 300 and the right side shows an inner structure of the homogenizing part 400, respectively.<br>
The pumping part 300 to which the polypropylene melt discharged from the cylinder 201 of the second extruder 200 is supplied comprises a casing 301 having an inner space, a pair of gears 302A and 302B engaged with each other and installed rotatably in the inner space of the casing 301, and a driving means 303 for rotating the gears 302A and<br>

Therefore, the pumping part 300 serves lo compulsorily transfer the polypropylene melt to the next process.<br>
D. Homogenizing part 400<br>
The homogenizing part 400 connected to the exit portion of the casing 301 of the pumping part 300 is divided into a rotating part 400A and a crushing part 400B. The rotating part 400A is composed of a first housing 401 of a hollow cylindrical shape, a driven sprocket 402 fixed to the outer surface of the first housing 401 and a driving means 404 to which a driving sprocket 403 is fixed.<br>

The drive sprocket 403 of the driving means 404 is geared with the driven sprocket 402 fixed to the outer surface of the first housing 401, whereby the first housing 401 is rotated in response to the operation of the driving means 404. An end of the first housing 401 corresponds to the exit portion of the casing 301 of the pumping part 300 and thus, the polypropylene melt discharged from the pumping part 300 flows' in the first housing 401. In the first housing 401, the temperature of the polypropylene melt are varied according to the location (that is, a central portion and outer portion of the inner space of the first housing).    However, since the polypropylene<br>
melt is mixed by the rotation movement of the first housing 401, the whole polypropylene melt is maintained constantly at a temperature. Here, since new polypropylene mell is supplied compulsorily and continuously by the pumping part 400, the polypropylene melt is rotated and moved at the same time<br>
The crushing part 400B is composed of a screw 410 connected to the exit portion of the first housing 401, a second housing 411 located on the outer circumference of the screw 410 and a frame 412 mounted on the outer circumference of the second housing 411 for forming an airtight space between the second housing 411 and the frame 412 The screw 410 is a cylindrical member having a spiral with a certain depth formed on the outer circumference surface thereof and a spiral-shaped space is formed between the screw 410 and the second housing 411 and extended to the entire length of the screw 410 Therefore, the polypropylene melt discharged from the first housing 401 of the rotating part 400A under a high pressure, is moved along the spiral-shaped space between the screw 410 and the second housing 411 and discharged out of the crushing part 400B<br>
Meanwhile, a heat transfer oil flows in the space formed between the second<br>
housing 411 and the frame 412.    That is, an inlet port 412A through which the heat<br>
transfer oil is supplied is formed at a side of the frame 412, an outlet 412B through which<br>
the heat transfer oil is discharged is formed at the otner side of the frame 412    The heat<br>
transfer oil that introduced to the space between the second housing 411 and the frame 412<br>
via the inlet port 412A contacts directly with the surface of the second housing 411 to<br>
adjust the temperature of the polypropylene melt that flows in the second housing 411<br>
The heat transfer oil that flows in the space between the second housirig 411 and the frame<br>
412 to adjust the temperature of the polypropylene melt is discharged via the outlet port<br>
412B.   Processes for inflow, adjustment of temperature and discharge are proceeded<br>
continuously, whereby the temperature of the polypropylene melt which flows in the<br>
spiral-shaped space between the second housing 411 and the screw 410 is adjusted to &amp; predetermined temperature.<br>
At the rear end of the homogenizing part 400, that is, the exit part of the second housing 411, a homogenizing means 450 is disposed for crushing and homogenizing a mixture of the discharged polypropylene melt and a nucleating agent<br>
FIG 6A and FIG. 6B are front views of a rotating plate 451 and a fixing plate 452 constituting the homogenizing means 450, respectively. The rotating plate 451 and the fixing plate 452 have same shape and are mounted in a state that they are contacted with each other, provided that the rotating plate 451 is mounted rotatablv<br>
A plurality of openings 451A are formed radially on the rotating plate 451, each opening 451A is slanted toward a center of the rotating plate 451 Also, a plurality of circular holes 452A are formed on the fixing plate 452.<br>
The polypropylene melt discharged from the second cylinder 411 arrives at the rotating plate 451 which is rotating and passes through each opening 451A formed on the rotating plate 451. At this point, the polypropylene melt is cut by an edge of each opening 451A, whereby all polypropylene melts are crushed homogeneously The crushed polypropylene melt is ground by the rotating plate 451 which rotates in the space between the rotating plate 451 and the fixing plate 452 and discharged through the holes 452A of the fixing plate 452.<br>
E. Dies part 500<br>
The temperature-controlled polypropylene melts discharged from the homogenizing part 400-is supplied to the dies part 500 to produce pellet-type foams.<br>
FIG. 7 is a plan view showing a structure of the dies part shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. X is a sectional view taken along the line B-B in FIG. 7, and FIG  9 is a sectional view<br>
taken along the line C-C in FIG 8     The dies part 500 is divided into a discharging part 500A a cutting part 500B and a driving means 500C.<br>
The discharging part 500A is composed of a hollow cylinder-shaped guide bar 501 and a cylinder 502 located outside the guide bar 501 On the outer circumference of the guide bar 501, a plurality of cavities 501A are formed in a longitudinal direction of the guide bar 501 The polypropylene melt discharged from the homogenizing part 400 flows in each cavity 501A The plurality of through holes 502A are formed at portions of the cylinder 502 corresponding to the respective cavities 501 A.<br>
The cutting part 500B is composed of a supporting plate 506 located at the rear side of the discharging part 500A and a cutting member 503 fixed to the supporting plate 506. The cutting member 503 is located movably on the outside of the cylinder 502 and has a plurality of through holes 503A formed at positions corresponding to the plurality of tlirough holes 502A of the cylinder 502, as shown in FIG. 9. As shown in figures, a diameter of the through holes 502A formed on the cylinder 502 is less than that of the through holes 503A formed on the cutting member 503. At an initial position, each through hole 502A of the cylinder 502 is located on a central portion of the corresponding through hole 503 A of the cutting member 503.<br>
Meanwhile, a plurality of grooves 502B are formed on the outer circumference of the cylinder 502 in a longitudinal direction and reciprocating rods 505 are located in the grooves 502B, respectively. The cutting member 503 is fixed to reciprocating rods 505 by fixing means such as a bolt, whereby the cutting member 503 is reciprocated on the outer circumference of the cylinder 502 by the reciprocating rod 505 which is. reciprocated along the groove 502B Of the cylinder 502.<br>
The driving means 500C of the dies part 500 is composed of an eccentric cam 511 which is rotated by a motor 510, a crank 512 that is connected to the eccentric cam 511 and<br>
rotated in response to the rotation of the cam 511 and a power converting and transmitting means 513 connected to the crank 512 for converting rotation movement of the crank 512 to linear movement and transmitting the linear movement to the supporting plate 506<br>
Once the eccentric cam 511 is rotated by the operation of the motor 510, the rotation movement of the crank 512 is converted to the linear movement by the power converting and transmitting means 513, and then transmitted to the supporting plate 506 to which ends of reciprocating rods 505 are fixed. Therefore, the cutting member 503 is reciprocated along the outer circumference of the cylinder 502<br>
Meanwhile, the polypropylene melt discharged from the homogenizing part 400 is injected under pressure to the plurality of cavities 501A formed on the guide bar 501 and then expanded through the through holes 502A of the cylinder 502. At this time, when each through hole 502A of the cylinder 502 corresponds to each through hole 503A of the cutting member 503 by the reciprocation of the cutting member 503 by the operation of the driving means 510, the polypropylene melt passes through the through holes 502A and 503A and then is expanded to the outside of the cutting member 503 with a certain length. Then, when through holes 502A of the cylinder 502 are released from the corresponding state with the through holes 503A of the cutting member 503 by the movement of the cutting member 503, the expanded polypropylene melt is cut by edges of the through holes 503A of the cutting member 503. Here, a dimension (length) of the cut foams is determined by a moving speed of the cutting members 503.<br>
Thus, after the polypropylene melt is expanding through the through holes 502A of the cylinder 502 and cut by the cutting member 503, the pellet-type foams are formed. A diameter of each through hole 502A of the cylinder 502 is 0.7mm and the expansion rate is about 5 times of a diameter of the through hole. Also, the cutting member 503 is reciprocated at a speed of 600 revolutions per minute.<br>
The polypropylene melt transferred from the crushing part 400B are subjected under a pressure of 120kgf/cm2 in the dies part If the polypropylene melt in the dies is exposed directly to the atmosphere, most of the foams are open cells. In order to prevent production of open cells, in the present invention, a decompression means is installed at the outside of the dies part.<br>
In FIG. 7, an example of the decompression means installed at the dies part is shown The decompression means 600 is a casing 601 for isolating the discharging part 500A and the cutting part 500B of the dies part 500 from the outside (the atmosphere). It is to be understood that a shape of the casing 601 is not limited. An entrance port 602 through which air is introduced is formed at an side of the casing 601, an exit port 603 through which air is exhausted is formed at the other side of the casing 601.<br>
A temperature of the air which is supplied to the casing 601 is room temperature or less and can be maintained by a cooling means (not shown). Also, it goes without saying that, in order to maintain properly a pressure in the casing 601 (for example, 0.8Kgf/cm2), an amount of the air supplied to the casing 601 can be controlled by a pump (not shown). Meanwhile, the exit port 603 can be connected to a storage means for storing the prepared pellet-type foams along with discharged air.<br>
A temperature in the cylinder 502 constituting the dies part 500 is very high and therefore, the temperature of the cylinder 502 should be properly maintained. For this, the present invention uses a cooling device 700 using the heat transfer oil, which is mounted on the dies part.<br>
FIG. 10A is a side view showing a cylinder of the dies parfeto which a cooling device is mounted and-FIG. 10B is the front view of FIG. 10A. The casing 601 of the decompression means 600 illustrated in FIG. 7 is not shown for conveniences' sake.<br>
The cooling device 700 used in the present invention comprises a ring-type<br>
