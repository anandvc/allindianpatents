				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a magnetically-<br>
actuated orthopedic implant for use in promoting the healing<br>
of bone fractures and in manipulating bone length. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an<br>
intramedullary device capable of changing its length in a<br>
cyclic manner under the influence of an electromagnetic field,<br>
said device being particularly suitable for the treatment of<br>
cases in which there is non-union of the fractured bone ends,<br>
as well" as for the primary treatment of long bone fractures.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of implant devices in the management of many<br>
orthopedic conditions is well known in the art. In some cases,<br>
the use of such internally-fitted devices may be the only<br>
effective way of stabilizing fractured bones. However, this<br>
approach suffers from the drawback that, once in place, the<br>
length and/or position of the implant cannot be physically<br>
manipulated without further surgical intervention. This is a<br>
particular drawback when implants are used in order to achieve<br>
one or both of the following clinical goals:<br>
a) increase or decrease in bone length, and<br>
b) accelerated healing of bone fractures.<br>
It is known in orthopedic surgery to sever a bone, such as a<br>
tibia or femur, in order to increase its overall length and<br>
thereby correct a skeletal or other defect. One common<br>
procedure for this purpose makes use of a special nail that is<br>
implanted in an intramedullary fashion into the bone to be<br>
lengthened. A longitudinally-adjustable frame external to the<br>
appendage containing the bone to be lengthened is secured at<br>
one end of the bone and it is attached at its other end to the<br>
nail as well as to the other end of the bone.<br>
The bone is then osteotomized by the surgeon and the<br>
adjustable frame is periodically lengthened, thereby causing<br>
the bone, while the break therein is knitting, to assume a<br>
desired overall length. The implant is then embedded in the<br>
lengthened bone.<br>
As pointed out in U.S. Patent 5,704,938 to Staehlin et al.<br>
(1998) the external frame fixation system used in this known<br>
bone lengthening procedure is difficult to securely locate on<br>
the patient and not only gives rise to discomfort, but it also<br>
presents an unattractive appearance. Moreover, pins anchored<br>
in the bone and protruding through the skin to join the frame<br>
increases the risk of infection and nerve injury, either<br>
immediate or delayed, during the lengthening procedure.<br>
To overcome these drawbacks, Staehlin provides a bone-<br>
lengthening device which is wholly implantable, except for a<br>
tube extending from the device and passing through the skin to<br>
supply a hydraulic fluid to the implant which is hydraulically<br>
adjustable in length.<br>
Staehlin"s two-part implant is mechanically complicated, for<br>
it includes a drive bolt located in one part that extends into<br>
the other part, which bolt, when rotated by a drive mechanism<br>
is activated by a hydraulically-operated plunger making it<br>
necessary to supply through a tube leading into the implant a<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid.<br>
In their least complicated forms, bone fractures may be<br>
treated by simple immobilization of the relevant body part.<br>
In many case, particularly when the fracture occurs in a long<br>
bone, this type of management may be sufficient to permit the<br>
body"s natural processes to completely close the fracture and<br>
to lead to complete healing of the affected bone. In other<br>
cases, the distance between the mating surfaces of a fractured<br>
bone may be so great as to result in non-union of the<br>
fracture. Clinically, non-union of fractures is often defined<br>
as failure of the fracture fragments to unite after 8 months.<br>
Typically, such a situation can arise from excessive movement<br>
at the fracture site, soft tissue interposition, infection, or<br>
trauma. In such cases, the normal process of calcification<br>
fails to take place and the fracture gap remains occupied by<br>
fibrocartilage and/or fibrous tissue. Ingrowth of new blood<br>
vessels cannot take place, and normal healing will be<br>
prevented.<br>
It has been found that application of cyclic compressive<br>
forces to the fracture (in imitation of the normal weight<br>
bearing forces) accelerates this process by up to one third of<br>
the normal healing time. This effect will be discussed in more<br>
detail hereinbelow.<br>
Currently, long bone fractures are preferably treated by the<br>
use of intramedullary nails or rods. The stability of these<br>
implant devices, and the reduced soft tissue damage caused<br>
thereby, render this approach preferable over open reduction<br>
techniques. However, although these implants permit weight<br>
bearing forces to be exerted thereon, they often isolate the<br>
fracture from compression forces due to the presence of<br>
locking screws, whose primary purpose is to prevent rotation.<br>
Also, as a result of the fixed distance between the fracture<br>
ends imposed on the fracture by virtue of their rigid<br>
structure, intramedullary nails can actually cause cases of<br>
fracture of non-union. Various studies have estimated that<br>
the incidence of non-unions that result directly from the use<br>
of intramedullary nails may reach up to 5% of all fracture<br>
cases treated with these devices.<br>
Various other techniques for managing non-union fractures have<br>
been used and reported in the art. For example, different<br>
forms of electrical stimulation have been investigated. These<br>
basic studies have in turn led to a number of proposals for<br>
promoting the healing of bone fractures, including invasive<br>
treatments involving the use of implanted electrodes as well<br>
as non-invasive techniques utilizing electrostatic and<br>
electromagnetic fields.<br>
U.S. 3,745,995, for example, describes metal splints that are<br>
affixed to fractured bone by means of screws. The device<br>
further comprises pickup coils having terminals connected both<br>
to said splints and to electrodes invasively inserted into the<br>
bone. A coil surrounding the limb having the fracture induces<br>
in the pickup coils an alternating current signal. In this<br>
way, the electrical signals are transmitted to the fracture<br>
ends.<br>
In another approach, the use of mechanical stimuli to promote<br>
healing of non-union fractures has been described. For<br>
example, in one study [J. Kenwright &amp; A.E. Goodship, Clin.<br>
Ortho. &amp; Rel. Res. (1989) 241: 36-47] the effects of<br>
mechanical stimulation on midshaft tibial breaks were<br>
investigated in experimental animals. The applied stimulation<br>
had frequencies approximating that of the walking frequency of<br>
the animal used. Cyclic loading of the fracture region for 17<br>
minutes per day was used. Although useful results were<br>
obtained in these experimental studies, it was found that it<br>
was critical to accurately control the displacements of the<br>
fractured bones, as high displacements were noted to lead to<br>
mechanical failure of the wound healing process.<br>
US 6,022,349 describes a method and system for treating bone<br>
fractures and osteoporosis that is based on the mechanical<br>
stimulation described in the aforementioned study by Kenwright<br>
and Goodship. However, it would appear that the apparatus<br>
described therein is not capable of producing the controlled,<br>
axially-directed oscillatory movements that imitate normal<br>
force-loading on the affected limb (e.g. the cyclic<br>
compression that occurs during walking), that have been shown<br>
to be useful in accelerating fracture healing.<br>
US 6,032,677 discloses a method and apparatus for stimulating<br>
the healing of medical implants, particularly those used in<br>
dental surgery. The apparatus described therein uses an<br>
internally-placed permanent magnet and externally applied<br>
electromagnetic field to cause oscillation of the implant<br>
within a tooth socket or medullary cavity of a fractured bone.<br>
It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a reliable<br>
implant device and method for the alteration of bone length.<br>
It is another purpose of the present invention to provide the<br>
aforementioned implant device in a form suitable for the<br>
management of bone fractures, particularly long bone<br>
fractures, and more particularly, cases of non-union of said<br>
long bone fractures.<br><br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a<br>
device for managing bone fractures that will act to prevent<br>
the occurrence of fracture non-union, by permitting movement<br>
of the fractured bone ends towards each other.<br>
Yet a further purpose of the invention is to provide a device<br>
and method for managing fractures that will reduce the time<br>
required for complete healing.<br>
It is another purpose of the invention to provide a device and<br>
method that may be applied during the initial stages of the<br>
treatment of bone fractures.<br>
It is a further purpose of the invention to provide a method<br>
for managing non-union fractures or for elongating or<br>
shortening bones that does not require the complete<br>
immobilization of the patient, or the use of uncomfortable and<br>
unaesthetic externally-placed devices such as external<br>
fixation frames.<br>
It is yet another purpose of the present invention to provide<br>
a device for the management of non-union fractures that<br>
overcomes the problems and disadvantages of prior art devices.<br>
It is yet another purpose of the present invention to provide<br>
a device for elongating or shortening bones that overcomes the<br>
problems and disadvantages of prior art devices.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent as the description proceeds.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is primarily directed to a two-part<br>
telescopic intramedullary orthopedic device capable of<br>
connecting two adjacent fractured or severed bone ends,<br>
characterized in that said device comprises<br>
a first section inserted into the medullary cavity of one<br>
of the fractured or severed bone ends, and secured thereto,<br>
and<br>
a second section inserted into the medullary cavity of<br>
the other fractured or severed bone end and secured thereto,<br>
wherein said second section comprises an internal space<br>
communicating with an external opening, and wherein said first<br>
section is more or less telescoped within said internal space<br>
of said second section, and<br>
wherein one of said sections comprises a ferromagnetic<br>
material and the other section is either constructed entirely<br>
of a non-magnetic material or comprises a ferromagnetic<br>
material, wherein the ferromagnetic section(s) are actuable by<br>
an external magnetic field, such that one section may be<br>
caused to move axially in relation to the other section, and<br>
wherein said axial movement may be either bidirectional or<br>
essentially unidirectional.<br>
The "move axially" and "axial movement" as used herein refer<br>
to movement of the ferromagnetic section or sections of the<br>
device in a direction parallel to the long axis thereof. Said<br>
axial movement may occur either bidirectionally (that is, in<br>
an oscillatory manner) or essentially unidirectionally, as<br>
will be described in the following sections.<br>
It has now been unexpectedly found that the above-defined two-<br>
part telescopic device may be used both to promote the<br>
accelerated healing of bone fractures, as well as to change<br><br>
bone length. It is to be emphasized that the accelerated<br>
healing effect may be obtained either in conjunction with<br>
bone-length alteration, or as a separate effect, in the<br>
absence of changes in bone length. It was further found that<br>
the accelerated healing effect occurs when the axial movement<br>
of the telescopic device is bidirectional (that is,<br>
oscillatory) , while bone lengthening or shortening is obtained<br>
when said axial movement is unidirectional. It has further<br>
been found that by alternating the mode of axial movement<br>
between unidirectional and bidirectional, it is possible to<br>
promote healing of the severed bone fragments in addition to<br>
inducing changes in the final length of the severed bone.<br>
The term "severed" bone ends, as used hereinabove and<br>
throughout this application is used to indicate the situation<br>
where the bone to be treated was intentionally severed into<br>
two portions by a surgeon as part of a procedure for changing<br>
the length of said bone. The term "fractured" bone ends,<br>
however, is used to indicate the more common situation,<br>
wherein a patient presents with a bone fracture that was<br>
caused by means other than planned surgical intervention.<br>
Thus in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a<br>
device as disclosed hereinabove, wherein the axial movement of<br>
one section of said device in relation to the other section is<br>
essentially unidirectional such that the first section of said<br>
device may be caused to shift progressively in one direction<br>
with respect to the second section, thereby changing the<br>
separation between the fractured or severed bone sections.<br>
It is to be noted that the term "essentially unidirectional",<br>
as used hereinabove, is employed to indicate that although the<br>
main mode of axial movement is in one direction only, the<br>
device of the invention will also permit low-amplitude<br>
bidirectional, oscillatory, movement for the purposes of<br>
promoting accelerated bone healing.<br>
In one embodiment of the device, the direction of the<br>
essentially unidirectional axial movement is such that the<br>
relative movement of the two sections of said device causes an<br>
increase in the length of the bone.<br>
In another embodiment of the device of the invention, the<br>
direction of the essentially unidirectional axial movement is<br>
such that the relative movement of the two sections of said<br>
device causes a decrease in the length of the bone.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
ferromagnetic material used in the construction of the<br>
section(s) comprising such material is a hard ferromagnetic<br>
material. Although any suitable hard ferromagnetic material<br>
may be used, this is preferably either Alnico or ferrite.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the device of the invention,<br>
the non-magnetic section (if used) is a synthetic plastic<br>
material. In another preferred embodiment, the non-magnetic<br>
material is titanium.<br>
In one preferred arrangement of the device, the first section<br>
of said device is formed by a core of ferromagnetic material,<br>
and the second implant section is formed by a tubular socket<br>
into which the first section is telescoped.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the device of the<br>
invention, the first section has a non-circular cross section<br>
and the internal space of the second section has a<br><br>
corresponding cross section whereby said first section cannot<br>
be rotated within said second section.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the device, telescopic<br>
advancement of the first section within the second section by<br>
incremental steps is achieved by a series of annular grooves<br>
formed along the first section, said grooves defining ratchet<br>
teeth that are detented by a pawl mounted on the second<br>
section. Preferably, said pawl is a flat spring having a<br>
tongue extending into a groove in the series thereof. In<br>
another embodiment, a pair of pawls is mounted on opposite<br>
sides of the second section. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the aforementioned grooves have a triangular cross<br>
section and a groove height with permits the first section<br>
ratcheted by the pawl to vibrate.<br>
The device of the present invention may also be constructed<br>
such the second implant section includes a reservoir loaded<br>
with a flowable healing agent and provided with an orifice<br>
from which is emitted a charge of the agent each time the<br>
first implant section is advanced an incremental step. This<br>
embodiment of the device may further comprise means to subject<br>
the agent in the reservoir to a pressure pulse each time the<br>
first implant section is advanced to force the agent out of<br>
the orifice. Many different healing agents may be used in<br>
conjunction with the device, including but not limited to,<br>
growth factors which promotes the bone healing process and<br>
antibiotics.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the first section of the<br>
device of the invention has a square cross section and the<br>
second section which is channel-shaped includes parallel<br>
sidewalls banking a cross section area matching the cross<br><br>
section of the first section whereby the first section can be<br>
telescopically received in the second section. In an even<br>
more preferred embodiment of the device, the first section has<br>
a top wall that is notched to define ratchet teeth that are<br>
detented by a pawl mounted on the second section whereby the<br>
first section can be incrementally advanced beyond the second<br>
section.<br>
The present invention is also directed to an orthopedic<br>
implant assembly adapted to manipulate the length of a<br>
skeletal bone to attain a predetermined length in a procedure<br>
in which a canal may be reamed through the bone to accommodate<br>
an implant and the bone severed to define complementary bone<br>
sections each having a cavity therein to receive a respective<br>
section of the implant, said assembly comprising:<br>
A. a two-part telescopic device, as disclosed<br>
hereinabove, and<br>
B. means external to said device to apply magnetic<br>
forces thereto to cause the one or more ferromagnetic sections<br>
of said device to shift progressively in one direction with<br>
respect to the other section of said device to change the<br>
separation therebetween until the severed bone attains said<br>
predetermined length.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the aforementioned assembly,<br>
the magnetic forces are constituted by successive impulses<br>
each of which causes the first section to advance an<br>
incremental step. In a more preferred embodiment of this<br>
aspect of the invention, the impulses of magnetic force are<br>
produced by applying direct current power pulses to a magnetic<br>
field coil adjacent to the bone whose length is to be changed.<br><br>
In one preferred arrangement of the aforementioned assembly,<br>
the bone to be manipulated is embedded in a body appendage and<br>
the field coil surrounds the appendage.<br>
The present invention also provides an assembly as disclosed<br>
hereinabove that further comprises means for applying an<br>
alternating magnetic force to the device after the first<br>
section of said device has been incrementally advanced to<br>
cause said first section to vibrate to promote the healing<br>
process. In one preferred embodiment, the alternating<br>
magnetic force is produced by a field coil adjacent to the<br>
device to which an alternating voltage is applied. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment said alternating voltage is<br>
generated by an oscillator whose frequency is such as to<br>
promote the healing process.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method of lengthening or shortening a skeletal bone to attain<br>
a predetermined length comprising the steps of:<br>
A. reaming the marrow of the bone to be lengthened or<br>
shortened to create a canal to accommodate a two-part<br>
telescopic intramedullary orthopedic device having a first<br>
section more or less telescoped within a second section,<br>
wherein one of said sections comprises a ferromagnetic<br>
material and the other section is either constructed of a non-<br>
magnetic material or comprises a ferromagnetic material;<br>
B. severing the bone to define complementary bone<br>
sections, each having a cavity therein;<br>
C. inserting the first section of the device into the<br>
cavity in one section of the bone and securing it thereto;<br>
D. inserting the second section of the device into the<br>
cavity of the other bone section and securing it thereto,<br>
whereby the degree to which the bone sections are separated<br><br>
and the severed bone is lengthened or shortened depends on the<br>
extent to which the first section projects beyond the second<br>
section; and<br>
E. applying successive magnetic force impulses to the<br>
first section to cause it to advance an incremental step per<br>
impulse until the severed bone has attained said predetermined<br>
length.<br>
In addition to the use of the aforementioned magnetic force<br>
impulses, the method also provides the use of ratchet and/or<br>
spring components within the telescopic device to cause the<br>
first section of the device to advance an incremental step.<br>
In one embodiment of the above-disclosed method, successive<br>
incremental steps in the advance of the first section are<br>
separated by time intervals of sufficient duration to permit<br>
effective healing of the severed bone. Preferably, the<br>
duration of each of said time intervals is at least one full<br>
day.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the method further comprises<br>
the step of monitoring the change of length of the implant by<br>
use of an imaging technique. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
imaging technique is ultrasonic imaging. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the imaging technique is based on the use of a<br>
magnetic sensor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the<br>
parameters of the magnetic force lie in the range of 100 to<br>
1000 newtons. In another preferred embodiment of the method,<br>
the implant is extended in increments of 0.1 to 1 mm per day.<br>
Preferably, 1-6 incremental steps per day are used in order to<br>
achieve the desired change in length. More preferably, 4<br><br>
incremental steps are used each day, each step representing a<br>
change in length of 0.1 mm.<br>
The present invention also encompasses a two-part telescopic<br>
device, as disclosed hereinabove, wherein the axial movement<br>
of one section of the device in relation to the other section<br>
is essentially bidirectional such that the ferromagnetic<br>
section(s) may be caused to oscillate axially, thereby causing<br>
axial oscillatory motion of the fractured or severed bone<br>
section(s) to which the device is attached, wherein the axial<br>
movement in one direction is caused by the magnetic forces<br>
induced by an external magnetic field on the ferromagnetic<br>
section(s), and wherein the axial movement in the opposite<br>
direction is caused either by magnetic forces having a<br>
reversed polarity or by mechanical means.<br>
This aspect of the invention is thus directed to a two-part<br>
telescopic device for promoting the healing of bone fractures,<br>
comprising<br>
a first section inserted into the medullary cavity of one<br>
of the fractured bone ends and secured thereto, and<br>
a second section inserted into the medullary cavity of<br>
the other fractured bone end and secured thereto,<br>
wherein said second section comprises an internal space<br>
communicating with an external opening, and wherein said first<br>
section is more or less telescoped within said internal space<br>
of said second section, and<br>
wherein at least one of said sections comprises a<br>
ferromagnetic material that is actuable by an external<br>
magnetic field, such that the ferromagnetic section(s) may be<br>
caused to oscillate axially,<br>
wherein the axial movement in one direction is caused by<br>
the magnetic forces induced by said magnetic field acting on<br><br>
said ferromagnetic section(s), and wherein the axial movement<br>
in the opposite direction is caused either by magnetic forces<br>
having a reversed polarity or by mechanical means.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the device of the invention,<br>
the magnetic forces are alternating magnetic forces having<br>
forward and reverse directional components, each of the two<br>

In another preferred embodiment of the device of the<br>
invention, the magnetic forces are unidirectional magnetic<br>
forces, and said device further comprises mechanical means for<br>
causing axial movement in a direction opposite to that of said<br>
magnetic forces.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mechanical means comprise a<br>

embodiment of the device of the invention, the section<br>
comprising the ferromagnetic material is constructed such that<br>
the ferromagnetic material itself is in the form of a "core"<br>
that is completely enclosed by a biocompatible material such<br><br>
as titanium or biocompatible stainless steel alloy such as L-<br>
316. This preferred two-layer structure obviates the health<br>
hazards associated with direct contact of certain<br>
ferromagnetic materials with living tissue.<br>
In the event that one of the two sections of the<br>
aforementioned device is entirely non-magnetic, said non-<br>
magnetic section may be made of any non-magnetic material<br>
possessing the required physical and mechanical properties.<br>
These properties include sufficient mechanical strength and<br>
rigidity to withstand the cyclical mechanical forces acting on<br>
the device, as well as sufficient toughness in order to reduce<br>
frictional wear. In addition, the materials need to be<br>
biocompatible. In one preferred embodiment, the non-magnetic<br>
section is formed of a synthetic plastic material. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the non-magnetic section is formed of<br>
titanium.<br>
In another aspect, the apparatus disclosed hereinabove further<br>
comprises means for causing the local release of biologically-<br>
active agents at the fracture site. Thus, in one preferred<br>
embodiment, the second section of the two-part device includes<br>
a reservoir loaded with a flowable healing agent and is<br>
provided with an orifice from which said agent is emitted. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the apparatus further comprises<br>
means for subjecting the agent in the reservoir to a pressure<br>

hereinbelow refers to magnetic forces that are cyclic nature<br>
such that the direction in which said forces are exerted is<br>
reversed in a periodic manner.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the magnetic field coil of<br>
the therapeutic system generates direct magnetic forces by<br>
means of the application of a direct voltage to said magnetic<br>
field coil.<br>
Although the therapeutic system disclosed hereinabove may be<br>
used to treat fractures in any part of the body, according to<br>
a preferred embodiment the fracture to be treated is located<br>
in a limb bone, and the magnetic field coil surrounds said<br>

internal space of the second section of said device provides a<br>
counter force to said unidirectional magnetic forces.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the method further comprises<br>
the step of monitoring the position of the device of the<br>
invention by use of an imaging technique. In one preferred<br>

preferred embodiment, the long-bone fracture is a non-union<br>
fracture.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention also encompasses<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The device, as disclosed hereinabove, consists essentially of<br>
two sections: a core-like first section, and a socket-like<br>
second section, said first section being capable of sliding in<br>
and out of said second section in an essentially telescopic<br>
manner. (For ease of description, the "first section" and<br>
"second section" of the device, as disclosed hereinabove and<br>
claimed hereinbelow, are referred to in the following<br>
description of preferred embodiments as "core section" and<br>
"socket section" (or readily-identifiable variants thereof)<br>
respectively.) It will also be recalled that at least one of<br>
these two sections comprises a ferromagnetic material. It is<br>
to be noted that the ferromagnetic section (s) may be the core<br>
section, the socket section or both sections. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, however, both sections of the device are<br>
ferromagnetic.<br>
The term "ferromagnetic material" as used herein, refers to<br>
magnetic materials having a magnetic constant Km that varies<br>
with an applied electric field, but that is typically much<br>
larger than unity. Such materials (which generally are based<br>
on one of the five elements: Fe, Co, Ni, Gd or Dy) are<br>
characterized by strong interactions between adjacent atomic<br>
dipoles, such that even in the absence of an applied magnetic<br>
field, there may be spontaneous dipole alignment. (In cases<br>
wherein spontaneous dipole alignment occurs, or wherein some<br>
ordered dipole alignment remains after removing an external<br>
field, the material may be considered to be "magnetic" as well<br>
as "ferromagnetic".) In any event, on application of an<br>
external field, the ordering or alignment of the dipoles is<br>
greatly enhanced, thus generating a large magnetic field.<br>
As disclosed hereinabove, the telescopic device of the<br>
invention is intended to be used in conjunction with an<br>
externally applied magnetic field, the purpose of said<br>
magnetic field being to induce axial movement of one or more<br>
of the sections of said device. The magnetic field is<br>
preferably generated by means of a solenoid or field coil<br>
consisting of a copper winding enclosed within a plastic<br>
cover. The internal diameter of the solenoid is designed to<br>
appropriately match the external dimensions of the body part<br>
to be treated, and is generally in the range of 20 to 30 cm.<br>
The length of the solenoid is typically about 10% to 30%<br>
greater than that of the telescopic device. The number of<br>
turns in the winding, per centimeter length along the<br>
solenoid, is adjusted such that an AT (ampere-turn) value in<br>
the range of 20,000 to 40,000 may be reached upon using<br>
suitable power supplies.<br>
Preferably, the solenoid is provided in a modular form, to<br>
allow an easy insertion thereof over the treated body part.<br>
Optionally, the solenoid is coupled with means for removing<br>
the heat produced thereby during operation. The heat removal<br>
may be accomplished by a water-containing spiral like<br>
structure, said spiral being in contact with the solenoid, or<br>
by causing air to flow between the turns of the solenoid.<br><br>
The solenoid may be constructed of any suitable ferromagnetic<br>
metals, but is preferably constructed of one of one or more of<br>
the following materials: iron, stainless 430, PH174.<br>
The device of the invention may be used in the following two<br>
essentially different ways, in accordance with the desired<br>
clinical effect:<br>
a) Essentially unidirectional movement of the ferromagnetic<br>
section(s), for use in situations where the desired clinical<br>
effect is an increase or decrease in bone length.<br>
b) Bidirectional movement of the ferromagnetic section(s), for<br>
use in situations where the clinician wishes to promote and<br>
assist the healing of bone fractures.<br>
A. UNIDIRECTIONAL MODE<br>
The Basic Implant Structure: A telescopic orthopedic device in<br>
accordance with the invention, as shown schematically in Fig.<br>
1, is adapted to lengthen a skeletal bone such as a leg or arm<br>
bone. To prepare the bone for lengthening, it is necessary<br>
for an orthopedic surgeon to perform an osteotomy in which the<br>
bone is severed to create complementary sections 10 and 11.<br>
The degree to which these bone sections are forced to separate<br>
by an implant anchored in the sections ultimately determines<br>
the extent to which the bone has been lengthened.<br>
And to prepare the bone for installation of the implant, it is<br>
possible for the surgeon before or after severing the bone to<br>
ream a canal through the marrow of the bone so that bone<br>
section 10 is then provided with an intramedullary cavity 10c<br>
and bone section 11 with an intramedullary cavity 11c.<br>
The implant includes a ferromagnetic magnet section 12 in the<br>
form of a core telescoped within a tubular non-magnetic<br>
section 13. Magnetic section 12 of the implant is received<br>
within cavity 11c of bone section 11 of the severed bone and<br>
is secured thereto by a screw 14 or other fastener means. The<br>
non-magnetic section 13 is received in cavity 10c of bone<br>
section 10 and is secured thereto by a screw 15. Hence the<br>
respective implant sections are anchored in the complementary<br>
bone sections.<br>
In practice, the core section 12 of the implant, instead of<br>
being cylindrical may have an elliptical cross section so that<br>
it cannot be rotated within socket section 13 which has a like<br>
cross section. But the core can be axially displaced so that<br>
it can be advanced axially to lengthen the implant.<br>
Alternatively, the cross section could be a circle having a<br>
flat segment, again for the purpose of preventing rotation but<br>
not axial movement. One is able for the same purpose to<br>
provide other core and socket section shapes.<br>
Core section 12 is preferably fabricated by a "hard"<br>
ferromagnetic material which is polarized to form a permanent<br>
magnet having a North Pole at one end and a South Pole at the<br>
opposite end. A suitable metallic material for core 12 is<br>
Alnico or other alloy having a high coercive force so that<br>
even though the core is small it acts as a powerful permanent<br>
magnet. Alternatively, a non-metallic "hard" ferromagnetic<br>
material such as a ceramic ferrite may be used for the core.<br>
The advantage of using a ferrite to fabricate core section 12<br>
rather than a metal which must be machined to assume the<br>
corrugated formation of the core, is that a ferrite can easily<br>
be molded to assume the desired configuration.<br><br>
It is not essential to the invention that the magnetic core<br>
section 12 of the implant be composed entirely of "hard"<br>
permanent magnet material, but only that it include a<br>
sufficient amount of such material as to be able to react to<br>
an impulse of magnetic force to effect a positive stepping<br>
action.<br>
Thus core section 12 may be constituted by a hollow cylinder<br>
of "hard" ferromagnetic material filled with a non-magnetic<br>
synthetic plastic composition. Or core section 12 may be<br>
formed by a solid plug of non-magnetic material having a head<br>
or cap of hard magnetic material functioning as a permanent<br>
magnet.<br>
The socket section 13 of the implant may, in one embodiment,<br>
be made entirely of non-magnetic plastic or metal material. A<br>
preferred material for this purpose is one commonly employed<br>
in prosthetic implants, such as titanium or a steel alloy. Or<br>
socket 13 may be molded of high-strength synthetic plastic<br>
material such as polypropylene or polyethylene. It is<br>
essential that the material from which the implant is composed<br>
be biologically compatible with the tissue in which it is<br>
embedded. In another embodiment, socket section 13 may<br>
comprise a ferromagnetic material, such as one of the<br>
ferromagnetic materials listed hereinabove.<br>
When the implant is installed so that its socket section is<br>
held within cavity 10c of bone section 10 and its core section<br>
is held within cavity 11c of bone section 11, the implant then<br>
bridges the separated complementary bone section.<br>
The implant can be pre-constructed so that both components are<br>
integrated and placed in either a retrograde or antegrade<br>
fashion into the medullary canal under fluoroscopic guidance.<br>
In the course of a stepwise bone lengthening procedure, the<br>
length of the bridge is incrementally increased until the<br>
overall length of the severed bone attains a predetermined<br>
value. Typically, the incremental length may be from 2 to 20<br>
centimeters.<br>
To allow adequate time for the severed bone sections to knit<br>
together and heal and to permit the soft tissues surrounding<br>
the bone to adjust thereto in the course of the incremental<br>
bone-lengthening procedure there should be a time interval<br>
between successive lengthening steps of sufficient duration<br>
for this purpose, such as at least one day per step.<br>
It is necessary that the implant, in the course of a<br>
lengthening procedure, maintain the bone sections bridged<br>
thereby in a proper alignment so that when the severed bone is<br>
healed, it is properly formed and not crooked. Because the<br>
implant is formed by a core telescoped in a socket and is<br>
coaxial therewith, the linearity of the implant is maintained<br>
as it is being lengthened.<br>
The circumferential surface of core section 12 of the implant,<br>
as shown in Fig. 2 is corrugated to form a series of equi-<br>
spaced annular grooves G1, G2, G3 etc. which define ratchet<br>
teeth. These teeth are detented by a pair of pawls 16A and<br>
16B mounted at diametrically opposed positions on the upper<br>
end of socket section 13, the pawls falling into successive<br>
grooves when the core is being pulled out of the socket in<br>
which it is telescoped. The pawls are preferably in the form<br>
of flat metal springs having tongues that fit into the<br>
grooves, the: spring flexing when the core is advanced so that<br>
the pawls can then snap into the next groove.<br><br>
The grooves G1 etc. along core 12 have a triangular cross<br>
section which as best seen in Fig. 3 is defined by a<br>
horizontal upper wall and an angled lower wall inclined<br>
downwardly with respect to the upper wall. Hence when the<br>
tongue of the flat spring is within a groove and one then<br>
seeks to displace the core downwardly, this movement is<br>
arrested by the horizontal wall of the groove which then abuts<br>
the tongue. But when one seeks to displace the core upwardly,<br>
the tongue then slides down the inclined wall of the groove to<br>
permit this advance.<br>
Hence the pawl and ratchet teeth mechanism associated with the<br>
core and socket make it possible to jack up the implant<br>
bridging the bone sections of the bone to be lengthened<br>
incrementally in a stepwise manner to progressively increase<br>
the length of the bridge until the overall length of the<br>
severed bone attains its predetermined desired value.<br>
In the implant shown in Fig. 2, the means which prevents the<br>
core from advancing backwards into the socket and thereby<br>
reducing the length of the bridge are the detents which engage<br>
the ratchet teeth. To resist retrograde movement in the<br>
implant arrangement shown in Fig. 2, one may to this end place<br>
underlying the core section 12 a helical spring 31 which urges<br>
the core upwardly and therefore resists downward movement of<br>
the core into the socket. The spring therefore acts to<br>
maintain the core at its advanced position.<br>
Other known means may be included in the implant to permit the<br>
required axial movement in one direction and to prevent<br>
retrograde movement.<br>
Second Embodiment:<br>
The invention does not require cylindrical or tubular implant<br>
sections but only that the first section telescope into the<br>
second section regardless of their cross sectional geometry.<br>
What is essential to the invention is that the first section<br>
functions as a permanent magnet and that the second section be<br>
non-magnetic so that when the implant installed in the<br>
complementary sections of the severed bone is subjected to an<br>
impulse of magnetic force, this will induce the first section<br>
to incrementally lengthen the implant and thereby lengthen by<br>
one step the severed bone.<br>
Thus the implant shown in Fig. 4 includes a non-magnetic<br>
section 17 which is channel-shaped and therefore has a<br>
rectangular cross section. Formed in the parallel sidewalls<br>
of this section are longitudinally extending grooves 17A and<br>
17B.<br>
Telescopically received in section 17 is a magnetic core<br>
section 18 having a square cross section that matches the<br>
cross sectional area between the sidewalls of section 17.<br>
Ribs 18A and 18B formed on opposing sides of section 18 slide<br>
into grooves 17A and 17B of the walls.<br>
Thus the magnetic cross section 18 can more or less telescope<br>
within the non-magnetic section 17. The top wall of section<br>
18 is provided with a row of transverse grooves defining<br>
ratcheted teeth 19 which cooperate with a pawl or detent (not<br>
shown) to limit the advance of this section to one step per<br>
impulse, as in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Advance of the Implant:<br><br>
An implant, in accordance with the invention, must be capable<br>
of being advanced incrementally. But it may also be made<br>
capable, when at any one ratcheted step, of causing the core<br>
of the implant to vibrate in order to promote the bone-healing<br>
process.<br>
The core ratchet can be designed so that its operation is<br>
limited to incremental advances or so that it can also vibrate<br>
at each step. A core whose operation is to be limited to<br>
incremental steps, may be provided with annular grooves G1,<br>
G2, G3 etc. as shown in Fig. 2 having an optimal height in the<br>
range of 0.1 to 1.5 millimeters. A core which can also<br>
vibrate at each step without causing it to advance to the next<br>
step is then provided with grooves of greater height in the<br>
range of 0.15 to 0.4 mm, thereby giving the pawl more freedom.<br>
Incremental advance of the permanent magnet core section 12 is<br>
effected by means external to leg L which as shown in Fig. 5<br>
has the implant 12-13 installed between the complementary bone<br>
sections of the severed bone to be lengthened and healed.<br>
These external means are constituted by a magnetic field coil<br>
20 surrounding leg L adjacent to the region of the implant<br>
therein and a DC power source 21 connected to the coil through<br>
a control switch 27. Source 21 is provided with a voltage<br>
control potentiometer 23 so that the strength of the field may<br>
be raised or lowered to a required degree.<br>
Each time switch 27 is momentarily closed, as surge of current<br>
flows unidirectionally through coil 20 to produce an<br>
electromagnetic field whose lines of flux penetrate the leg<br>
and are intercepted by magnet core section 12 of the implant.<br>
The direction of current flow in the coil is such as to<br><br>
produce a magnetic field whose polarity repels the polarized<br>
core and hence acts as an impulse of magnetic force to advance<br>
the core of one step.<br>
The implant, which functions dynamically, behaves like a<br>
dynamic loudspeaker. In a speaker of this type, a field coil<br>
mounted on a cone is displaced axially with respect to a fixed<br>
permanent magnet, the displacement of the coil being in<br>
accordance with variations in current flowing through the<br>
coil. In a dynamic implant in accordance with the invention,<br>
the coil is at a fixed position whereas the permanent magnet<br>
core anchored in a bone section is movable and is displaced to<br>
an extent and in a direction in accordance with variations in<br>
current flowing through the coil.<br>
When one wishes to vibrate the core at each step before the<br>
core is advanced to the next step, then coil 20 is connected<br>
to an A-C generator 24 through a switch 25. When switch 25 is<br>
closed, the resultant A-C electromagnetic field causes the<br>
core to oscillate. The frequency of oscillation is such as to<br>
promote the healing process.<br>
Ideally, coil 20 comprises helical windings that encircle the<br>
appendage enclosing the bone to be lengthened such the when<br>
the coil is energized momentarily, the resultant surge or<br>
impulse of magnetic force is applied in the axial direction to<br>
maximize the pull exerted by the impulse on the magnetic<br>
section of the implant. And instead of a helical coil, a<br>
ring-shaped toroidal coil may be designed so as to slip over<br>
the appendage.<br>
When the location of the bone to be lengthened is such that it<br>
cannot be surrounded by a magnetic field coil, then use may be<br>
made of a pair of planar or pancake coils which flan opposing<br>
sides of the bone location and are connected in series to a<br>
power source to produce combined magnetic fields which exert<br>
an axial force on the implant.<br>
As a practical matter, it is difficult in each bone<br>
lengthening procedure to predetermine the magnitude of the<br>
magnetic force impulse necessary to cause the implant to<br>
advance a single step per implant and no more. Clearly an<br>
excessive force may cause the core section of the implant to<br>
jump several steps, whereas a weak force may be insufficient<br>
to cause this section to advance even one step.<br>
The magnitude of the magnetic force impulse appropriate to a<br>
given implant installation is best determined empirically by<br>
means of a voltage supply for the field coil having a control<br>
potentiometer. The potentiometer is operated to slowly raise<br>
the voltage applied to the coil until a point is reached where<br>
a stepping action takes place, as indicated by the clicking<br>
sound of the ratchet mechanism. This clicking sound can best<br>
be heard by means of a stethoscope. Having determined the<br>
magnitude of voltage that brings about a stepping action, the<br>
same magnitude is applied in successive steps.<br>
Healing:<br>
The healing process by which the bone sections knit together<br>
in the course of a bone-lengthening procedure can be promoted<br>
by discharging into the gap region between the bone section in<br>
which healing transpires a growth factor, such as a bone<br>
morphogenetic protein or a decalcified bone matrix in granular<br>
or paste form. Other growth factors are useable, such as<br>
transforming growth factor beta or osteogenic growth peptide<br>
or OP-1.<br>
To this end, in the embodiment of the implant shown in accompany Fig. 6<br>
socket 13 includes at its base a well or reservoir filled with<br>
a growth factor borne by a carrier to create a gel 27, the<br>
well being confined by a disc 28. At the bottom of this well<br>
and slideable thereon is a piston 29 operated by a piston rod<br>
30 attached to core section 12 telescoped in socket 13. Hence<br>
each time the core section is advanced, the piston is then<br>
raised thereby to apply a pressure pulse to the growth factor<br>
gel, causing it to extrude into the gap region between the<br>
bone sections through orifices 31 in the wall of socket<br>
section 13 of the implant.<br>
Instead of a growth factor, the gel or cream may be an<br>
antibiotic such as penicillin or cephalosporin, or any other<br>
suitable antibiotic to reduce the risk of infection in the<br>
course of the healing process, or to treat bone infected in<br>
the course of being lengthened.<br>
Also useful for healing is a sub-dermal reservoir adapted to<br>
cause infusion into the bone lengthening area of mesenchymal<br>
cells. This is of particular value when treating the limbs of<br>
a cancer patient who has been exposed to irradiation giving<br>
rise to a lack of mesenchymal cells.<br>
Imaging:<br>
When in a bone lengthening procedure an external adjustable<br>
frame is used which is mechanically coupled to an internal<br>
implant, then one observing the frame can determine, by means<br>
of a scale on the frame, the extent to which the bone has been<br>
lengthened.<br>
But in a bone lengthening procedure in accordance with the<br>
invention in which there is no mechanical linkage between an<br>
internal implant and an external frame, one is unable to tell<br>
the extent to which the bone has been lengthened, if indeed it<br>
has been lengthened at all. Thus while one knows the degree<br>
to which the implant is lengthened, per step, one cannot be<br>
sure that with each application of a magnetic force, the core<br>
has actually stepped, particularly since the resistance<br>
offered by the leg to each step in a bone lengthening<br>
procedure often varies from step to step.<br>
Should one depend on hearing a clicking sound to determine how<br>
many steps the implant has advanced incrementally, one must be<br>
careful to correctly count the clicks. Yet one cannot be sure<br>
that with each click, there has been an actual stepwise<br>
advance.<br>
In order therefore to be able to actually see the operation of<br>
the implant and the extent to which it is lengthening the<br>
bone, use may be made of an ultrasound imaging system, as<br>
shown in Fig. 7. The piezoelectric transducer 32 of this<br>
system generates periodic ultrasonic pulses that are<br>
propagated through the leg tissue and are reflected by the<br>
bone. This transducer is placed on leg L at a position<br>
overlying the implant therein. Coil 20 surrounding the leg is<br>
configured to create an opening therein to accommodate the<br>
transducer, so that the transducer operates in the region of<br>
the magnetic field emanating from the coil.<br>
One therefore sees on the monitor screen 22 of the ultrasound<br>
imaging system, a full scale image of the implant (12-13)<br>
interposed between the bone sections (10-11) . And one can<br>
measure on the screen the adjusted distance between the<br>
severed sections of the bone. As an alternative to the use of<br>
an ultrasound imaging technique, the present invention also<br>
makes provision for imaging techniques based on the use of<br>
magnetic sensors.<br>
In a procedure in accordance with the invention the proximity<br>
of coil 20 to the implant depends on the dimensions of the<br>
appendage and the locations of the implant therein. Hence the<br>
power required to produce a magnetic force sufficiently strong<br>
to step the core depends on how close the coil is to the core<br>
and the strength of the magnet. But with imaging, one can see<br>
whether the magnetic force acting on the core does in fact<br>
step the core, and if it does not, one can then increase the<br>
power applied to the coil to bring about the desired action.<br>
This imaging system is a useful adjunct to the implant<br>
procedure but not a prerequisite thereto. Other systems such<br>
as an oscilloscope connected to a microphone can be used to<br>
detect the click sound generated by advancement of the ratchet<br>
mechanism. Also X-ray imaging can be used to visualize<br>
lengthening of the implant. However, this entails multiple<br>
exposures to ionizing radiation and may have adverse side<br>
effects.<br>
The implant functions not only to lengthen (or shorten) the<br>
bone, but also when the bone is lengthened (or shortened) and<br>
healed, to reinforce the bone. The dimensions of the implant<br>
must be appropriate to those of the bone in which it is<br>
implanted. Hence a bone which has a large cross sectional<br>
area and when severed offers a relatively high resistance to<br>
being lengthened, demands an implant whose dimensions are<br>
appropriate to the bone. The same implant may be unsuitable<br>
for a bone having a smaller cross sectional area.<br>
A preferred material for forming the non-magnetic section of<br>
the implant is titanium. The reason for the use of titanium<br>
rather than any other material is that it is known from the<br>
use of titanium in a dental implant in which a titanium post<br>
is screwed into a hole drilled in a jaw bone, that the bone<br>
then literally proceeds to fuse with the titanium. Such<br>
fusion does not take place with other materials.<br>
Third Embodiment:<br>
Instead of using the implant to lengthen a bone, it can be<br>
adapted to shorten a bone to a desired extent. To this end, a<br>
short piece of bone to be shortened is excised to provide a<br>
relatively large gap between the ends of the complementary<br>
bone sections. The ferromagnetic core section of the implant<br>
is then lodged in one of these bone sections and the non-<br>
magnetic socket section in which the core is telescoped is<br>
lodged in the other bone section.<br>
Then by applying an external magnetic force thereto, the core<br>
section of the implant is caused to advance an incremental<br>
step further into the socket section, thereby reducing the gap<br>
between the bone sections. This action is repeated until the<br>
shortened distance between the ends of the bone section<br>
provides a bone of the desired shortened length.<br>
When the implant is adapted to shorten a bone, the detenting<br>
of the core section must be such as to permit its stepwise<br>
advance into the socket section and prevent retrograde<br>
movement.<br>
Fourth Embodiment:<br>
An orthopedic implant adapted to transport a bone fragment<br>
requires a ferromagnetic core the opposite ends of which are<br>
telescoped within respective non-magnetic sockets. These<br>
sockets are lodged in the complementary ends of the severed<br>
bone sections.<br>
When a magnetic force is applied to the implant, the core is<br>
then advanced to step further into one socket and at the same<br>
time to step further out of the other socket without changing<br>
the length of the bone, for the distance between the ends of<br>
the complementary bone section remains unchanged.<br>
In this way, a bone fragment may be transported from one bone<br>
section to the other in a direction that depends on the<br>
polarity of the magnetic force applied to the core.<br>
While there have been disclosed preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, it is to be understood that many changes may be<br>
made therein without departing from the spirit of the<br>
invention. Thus the implant may be used not to lengthen a<br>
bone but as a splint to maintain a fractured bone in proper<br>
alignment as the bone undergoes a natural healing process. In<br>
this situation, a canal is reamed through the marrow of the<br>
fractured bone to receive the implant. One section of the<br>
implant is anchored in a section of the bone on one side of<br>
the fractured region, and the other section is anchored in the<br>
bone section on the opposite side of this region. In this<br>
case the implant is not magnetically actuated unless in order<br>
to straighten out the fractured bone it is necessary to<br>
lengthen the implant.<br>
B. BIDIRECTIONAL (OSCILLATORY) MODE<br>
In the case of a long-bone fracture, the core section is<br>
preferably attached to the distal section of the fractured<br>
bone, the socket section being fixed into the cavity of the<br>
proximal part of the fracture. The present invention,<br>
however, also encompassed the possibility of the reverse<br>
situation, that is, wherein the core section is fixed to the<br>
proximal bone segment, while the socket section is attached to<br>
the distal segment.<br>
In many cases, it will be highly advantageous to install the<br>
device of the invention such that the core section is inserted<br>
deep inside the socket section. In such cases, one end of<br>
each of the two sections of the device will be fixed into the<br>
medullary cavity of one of the bone segments, while the other,<br>
free, extremity of each section will extend into the medullary<br>
cavity of the other segment (without being attached thereto).<br>
The free end of the core section, in such cases, will not be<br>
in direct contact with living tissue within the medullary<br>
cavity, but rather enclosed within the inner space of the<br>
socket section.<br>
In other cases, rather less overlap between the two sections<br>
will be required, with only one of the sections (either the<br>
socket section or the core section) having both of its<br>
extremities situated within the bounds of the medullary<br>
cavities of both of the fractured bone segments. In still<br>
other cases, the overlap will be minimal, the region of<br>
insertion of the core section into the socket section being<br>
confined to the space between the fractured bone segments.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a two-part telescopic device for use<br>
in promoting the healing of bone fractures in accordance with<br>
the present invention is shown schematically in Fig. 1. In<br>
this figure, the two sections of a fractured long bone are<br>
represented by numerals 10 and 11. By way of preparation<br>
before installing the device of the invention, the surgeon may<br>
ream a canal through the bone marrow of each of the fractured<br>
bone ends to from intramedullary cavities 10C and 11C.<br>
The embodiment of the two-part device depicted in Fig. 1<br>
includes a ferromagnetic section 12 in the form of a core<br>
telescoped within a tubular non-magnetic section 13. Said<br>
ferromagnetic section 12 of the device is received within<br>
cavity 11C of bone section 11 of the fractured bone, and is<br>
secured thereto by means of one or more locking screws 14 or<br>
by the use of any other suitable bio-compatible fastener<br>
means. Non-magnetic section 13 is inserted into cavity 10C of<br>
bone section 10 and is secured thereto by means of one or more<br>
locking screws 15. In one embodiment of the invention, said<br>
locking screws 14 and 15 are each inserted into, and anchored<br>
within, the bone cortex on one side of the medullary cavity.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, said locking screws are<br>
inserted into, and anchored within, the bone cortex on both<br>
sides of the medullary cavity. It may thus be seen that the<br>
two sections of the device of the invention are anchored in<br>
the medullary cavities of the two fractured bone ends.<br>
Core section 12 is preferably fabricated of a "hard"<br>
ferromagnetic magnetic material which is polarized to form a<br>
permanent magnet having a North Pole at one end and a South<br>
Pole at the opposite end. A suitable metallic material for<br>
core 12 is Alnico or any other alloy having a high coercive<br>
force so that even though the core is small, it acts as a<br>
powerful permanent magnet. Alternatively, a non-metallic<br>
"hard" ferromagnetic material such as a ceramic ferrite may be<br>
used for the core. The advantage of using a ferrite to<br>
fabricate core section 12 rather than a metal which must be<br>
machined to assume the corrugate formation of the core is that<br>
a ferrite can easily be molded to assume the desired<br>
configuration.<br>
It is not essential to the invention that the magnetic core<br>
section 12 of the device be composed entirely of a "hard"<br>
permanent material, but only that it include a sufficient<br>
amount of such a material as to be able to react to an impulse<br>
of magnetic force to effect the desired electromechanical<br>
oscillation of the device.<br>
The non-magnetic socket section 13 of the device may be made<br>
entirely of a non-magnetic plastic or metal material. A<br>
preferred material for this purpose is one commonly employed<br>
in prosthetic implants, such as titanium or a steel alloy.<br>
The reason for the preferred use of titanium is that it is<br>
known from the use of this material in dental implants in<br>
which a titanium post is screwed into a hole drilled into a<br>
jaw bone, that the bone then literally proceeds to fuse with<br>
the titanium. Such fusion does not appear to take place with<br>
other materials.<br>
Preferably, the magnetic core section 12 is fitted with a<br>
small projection (not shown in the figures) on its external<br>
surface, in close proximity to its free end. This projection<br>
engages a longitudinal slot in a corresponding portion of the<br>
socket section 13, the end of said slot that is closest to the<br>
free end of said socket section forming a stop, beyond which<br>
the projection on core section 12 cannot travel. The purpose<br>
of this arrcingement is to prevent said magnetic core section<br>
12 from moving outwards from socket section 13 further than a<br>
preset value, or from completely separating therefrom. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the abovementioned projection has a<br>
triangular, fin-like, outline shape.<br>
When the device is installed such that its magnetic section is<br>
held within cavity 10C of fractured bone section 10 and its<br>
non-magnetic section is held within cavity 11C of bone section<br>
11, these two sections of said device then bridge the<br>
fractured and separated bone sections. Thus, in addition to<br>
the use of the device (in conjunction with the externally-<br>
placed magnetic field as disclosed hereinabove and described<br>
hereinbelow) , the two-part device of the invention may be used<br>
as a static stabilizing device for use in the very first<br>
stages of the management of fractured bones. A further<br>
advantage of the device of the invention is that its use from<br>
the earliest stage of hospital management through to complete<br>
healing ensures that the fractured sections are maintained in<br>
their correct alignment, in view of the co-axial, rigid nature<br>
of said device. Yet another advantage offered by the device<br>
of the invention is that it may be used in place of an<br>
earlier-inserted intramedullary nail, without the need for<br>
further preparation of the fractured bone segments.<br>
In order for the apparatus of the invention to function<br>
optimally, both as an oscillatory two-part device and as a<br>
static bridging device, it is necessary to construct said<br>
apparatus such that its dimensions are appropriate to those of<br>
the bone in which it will be installed. Thus, a bone which<br>
has a large cross-sectional area requires a device having<br>
dimensions appropriate for said bone. The same device,<br>
however, may be unsuitable for a bone having a smaller cross-<br>
sectional area.<br>
The device of the invention may be pre-joined so that the<br>
integrated device is placed in either a retrograde or<br>
antegrade manner into the medullary canal under fluoroscopic<br>
guidance.<br>
Although the device of the invention may be constructed with a<br>
circular cross-sectional shape, as shown in Fig. 8, any other<br>
cross-sectional form that permits the magnetic and non-<br>
magnetic sections to oscillate freely in relation to each<br>
other may be used. Such cross-sectional forms include but are<br>
not limited to square, rectangular, square or rectangular with<br>
rounded corners or elliptical or ellipsoid.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the core section<br>
12 and the socket section 13 are caused to oscillate in<br>
relation to each other by the application of an external<br>
magnetic field. The range of movement of one of said sections<br>
in relation to said other section is 10 µm to 2 mm, with a<br>
periodicity of oscillation of 0.1-1000 Hz. Thus, in the case<br>
of the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1, said external<br>
magnetic field is an alternating field, such that alternating<br>
magnetic forces are applied to ferromagnetic core section 12.<br>
Said core section then moves in and out of socket section 13<br>
in a way essentially similar to the motion of a piston within<br>
a cylinder of an internal combustion engine. The use of the<br>
device of the invention together with an external magnetic<br>
coil is depicted in Fig. 5. The external means for applying<br>
the magnetic field shown in this figure comprise a magnetic<br>
field coil 20 surrounding the affected limb L in the region<br>
adjacent to the location of the installed device, said coil<br>
being placed such that its entire structure is placed distal<br>
to the distal extremity of the magnetic core section 12. In<br>
the case of the embodiment presently described, an alternating<br>
magnetic field is applied by connecting coil 20 to an<br>
alternating current (AC) generator 24 through a switch 25.<br>
When switch 25 is closed, the resultant AC electromagnetic<br>
field causes the ferromagnetic core section 12 to oscillate<br>
within socket section 13, as described hereinabove.<br>
Preferably the AC voltage used to generate the AC<br>
electromagnetic field is between 1 and 1000 V, with a<br>
frequency of between 0.1 and 1000 Hz.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the device, as shown in<br>
Fig. 8, a helical spring 31 may be fitted beneath the core<br>
section 12 in the internal space of socket section 13. Said<br>
helical spring may be attached to either the end of core<br>
section 12, the base of the internal space of socket section<br>
13, to both of these structures. The purpose of spring 31 is<br>
to provide counter force to a unidirectional magnetic force<br>
which, in Fig. 8, is applied in a direction such that<br>
ferromagnetic core 12 moves further inside socket section 13.<br>
It should be noted that although the embodiment depicted in<br>
Fig. 8 shows the use of a helical spring, any other suitable<br>
type of spring device may be used in its place. In this<br>
embodiment of the invention, the unidirectional magnetic force<br>
is effected by means of a direct current (DC) power source, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5. Said DC power source is fitted with a<br>
voltage control potentiometer 23 so that the strength of the<br>
field may be raised or lowered to the required value.<br>
Preferably, the DC voltage is in the range of 1-1000 V. Each<br>
time switch 27 is closed, a surge of current flows<br>
unidirectionally through coil 20 to produce an electromagnetic<br>
field whose lines of flux penetrate the leg and intercepted by<br>
magnet core section 12 of the device. The direction of<br>
current flow in the coil is such as to produce a magnetic<br>
field whose polarity is such that said core section is<br>
impelled towards the base of the internal space of core<br>
section 13. As a consequence of this reduction of space<br>
within the internal cavity of socket section 13, helical<br>
spring 31 (Fig. 8) is compressed. When the potential energy<br>
of said spring reaches a critical value (corresponding to the<br>
point wherein the kinetic energy of the spring is at its<br>
lowest value, and its potential energy at its highest value),<br>
said spring is able to overcome the path of travel of core 12<br>
and pushes said core in the opposite direction, and in so<br>
doing, allows the spring 31 to relax, until said core reaches<br>
a stop position that is defined by the furthest point of<br>
travel of the above-described projection on the surface of<br>
said core within the slot present in socket section 13. This<br>
process then proceeds in a cyclical manner, thus causing core<br>
12 to oscillate within socket section 13.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, the spring and the<br>
magnetic coil are arranged such that the unidirectional<br>
magnetic forces cause the ferromagnetic core section 12 to<br>
travel outwards, away from the base of socket section 13, thus<br>
extending the total effective length of the device. In this<br>
case, the helical spring reaches its maximal extended state,<br>
wherein the potential energy stored therein reaches a maximal<br>
value, said potential energy serving to counter the<br>
unidirectional magnetic forces and to drive the core section<br>
12 back towards the base of socket section 13.<br>
It is to be noted that although the field coil 20 depicted in<br>
Fig. 5 is a helical coil, other suitable coils, such as ring-<br>
shaped toroidal coils that may be readily slipped over the<br>
appendage to be treated, may also be used. When the location<br>
of the fracture to be treated is such that it cannot be<br>
surrounded by a magnetic field coil, use may be made of a pair<br>
of planar or pancake coils which flank opposite sides of the<br>
bone location, and which are connected in series to a power<br>
source to produce combined magnetic fields which exert an<br>
axial force on the device of the invention.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that<br>
it is the oscillation of the two fractured bone sections into<br>
which the oscillating two-part device is attached, which is<br>
responsible for the promotion of the healing process.<br>
The device of the invention may be used to assist healing of<br>
bone fractures by application of the electromagnetic field as<br>
described above, thus causing the ferromagnetic section to<br>
oscillate within the other, non-magnetic section. Preferably,<br>
the device is caused to oscillate for periods of between one<br>
minute and 120 minutes, up to three times per day.<br>
Alternatively, the device may be used in a continuous<br>
treatment regime.<br>
The healing process by which fractured bone sections knit<br>
together can be accelerated and assisted by use of the<br>
apparatus and method of the present invention as described<br>
hereinabove. This healing process may be further assisted by<br>
discharging into the gap region between the fractured bone<br>
ends a healing factor, such as a growth factor with healing<br>
properties such as bone morphogenetic protein or a decalcified<br>
bone matrix in granular or paste form. Other growth factors<br>
may also be used, including (but not limited to) transforming<br>
growth factor beta and osteogenic growth peptide (OP-1).<br>
Although these growth factors have been in clinical use for<br>
many years, the device of the present invention permits their<br>
controlled, local, high-concentration release into the region<br>
of the healing fracture.<br>
To this end, the device of the invention may incorporate a<br>
well or reservoir filled with a growth factor within the base<br>
of socket section 13. Said growth factor may be borne by a<br>
carrier to create a gel, the well being confined by a disc.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a piston arrangement (not<br>
illustrated) attached to core section 12 is used to apply a<br>
pressure pulse to the growth factor preparation within its<br>
well. Hence, each time the core section is advanced, the<br>
piston is raised thereby applying a pressure pulse to the<br>
growth factor gel, causing it to extrude into the gap region<br>
between the bone sections through orifices in the wall of<br>
socket section 13 of the device.<br>
Instead of a growth factor, the gel or cream may comprise an<br>
antibiotic such as penicillin or cephalosporin, or any other<br>
suitable antibiotic to reduce the risk of infection in the<br>
course of the healing process. An additional benefit of the<br>
use of a locally-released antibiotic in conjunction with the<br>
device of the present invention is that it will permit the<br>
wider use of said device, particularly in cases of fracture<br>
associated with more severe soft tissue damage (such as<br>
Gustilo classes IIIA and IIIB), might be more successfully<br>
treated by intramedullary devices.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the antibiotic may be contained<br>
within a well or reservoir and delivered by use of a<br>
mechanical piston system that is linked to ferromagnetic core<br>
section 12 (as described hereinabove). Alternatively,<br>
according to another preferred embodiment, the external<br>
surfaces of the core section 12 and the socket section 13 may<br>
be coated with antibiotic-containing granules. Such a coating<br>
will serve as a slow-release system, allowing delivery of the<br>
antibiotic both to the region of the fracture (thus speeding<br>
the healing process) and to the inside of the device of the<br>
invention (thus preventing problems of bacterial contamination<br>
thereof) .<br>
Also useful for healing is a sub-dermal reservoir adapted to<br>
cause infusion of mesenchymal cells into the healing bone<br>
region.<br>
The abovementioned healing factors, growth factors and<br>
antibiotics may be released from the device of the invention<br>
in various amounts, in either a continuous or controlled<br>
manner. In the case of continuous release, the device of the<br>
invention may be loaded with between 1 and 10 g of the<br>
aforementioned healing factors, growth factors and<br>
antibiotics. In the case of controlled release, the device<br>
may be loaded with up to 1 mg of these substances. These doses<br>
are given for the purpose of exemplification only, and are not<br>
intended to limit the amounts of such substances that may be<br>
used in combination with device of the present invention.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been<br>
described for the purpose of illustration, it will be<br>
understood that the invention may be carried out in practice<br>
by skilled persons with many modifications, variations and<br>
adaptations, without departing from its spirit or exceeding<br>
the scope of the claims.<br>
