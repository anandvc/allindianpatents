WASHING MACHINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a construction of a washing machine that cleanses, rinses and dehydrates clothes.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
   A structure of a conventional washing machine is described with reference to Fig. 11 and Fig. 12.<br>
Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view of the conventional washing machine, and Fig. 12 is a cross sectional view of an essential part of the same machine. In Fig. 11, body 101 of a washing machine has water tub 103 supported by suspension 102. In water tub 103, cleansing basket 104 doubling as a spin dryer (hereinafter referred to as basket 104) is installed rotatably. Basket 104 has a top opening, through which articles to be cleansed are loaded. On a bottom section of basket 104, agitator 105 (pulsator) is equipped rotatably. Basket 104 has numerous small holes on a sidewall.<br>
In Fig. 12, basket 104 is fixed to dryer shaft 107 journaled by bearing 106 disposed at a lower part of water tub 103. Agitator 105 is fixed at a first end of washing shaft 109 journaled by bearing 108 within hollow-dryer-shaft 107. A second end of washing shaft 109 is coupled to a first end of input shaft 111 of a speed reduction mechanism via speed reduction mechanism 110. Pulley 112 is mounted to a second end of input shaft 111 of the speed reduction mechanism.<br>
The second end of input shaft 111 shows a circle in its cross sectional view, and is sided by shaving to form a quadrilateral so that a mounting hole<br><br>
2<br>
of pulley 112 can mate with the shaved second end, and pulley 112 is fixed to shaft 111. Pulley 112 is coupled to motor 114 shown in Fig. 11 via belt 113. Motor 114 drives shaft 111 via pulley 112. Shaft 111 has clutch 115 for switching the transmission of the driving force of motor 114 either to washing shaft 109 or to dryer shaft 107.<br>
Clutch 115 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch boss 116 having a hole mating with the shaved second end<br>
of shaft 111;<br>
(b)	clutch spring 117; and<br>
(c)	sleeve 118 for transmitting the force of a clutch driver for driving<br>
the clutch.    A first end of spring 117 winds around clutch boss 116 and a<br>
second thereof winds around dryer shaft 107.<br>
Clutch driver 119 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch claw 120;<br>
(b)	clutch lever 121;<br>
(c)	clutch switcher (not shown) including, e.g. a geared motor for<br>
rotating clutch lever 121; and<br>
(d)	clutch lever spring 122.<br>
An operation of the conventional washing machine constructed above is hereinafter described.<br>
First, load laundry to basket 104, then supply a given quantity of water from a water tap (not shown). Start washing when the given quantity of water is filled. At this moment, spring 122 urges clutch claw 120 of clutch driver 119 to be engaged with sleeve 118 and loosen spring 117. This produces slipping between spring 117 and clutch boss 116.<br>
The rotating force of motor 114 not only drives pulley 112 via belt 113, but also drives shaft 111 of the speed reduction mechanism.   Shaft 111 then<br><br>
3<br>
drives washing shaft 109 via speed reduction mechanism 110, and further drives agitator 105 fixed to washing shaft 109. Motor 114 is switched its driving direction at given time intervals, which also switches the rotating direction of agitator 105.   The laundry thus starts being cleansed.<br>
Second, discharge the water from basket 104 when the cleansing step is finished, then move on spin-drying. At this moment, clutch switcher rotates clutch lever 121, thereby claw 120 comes off from sleeve 118, and spring 117 winds around boss 116.<br>
Under this condition, the driving force of motor 114 travels to pulley 112 via belt 113 and drives shaft 111, further it drives dryer shaft 107 via clutch boss 116 and spring 117. Basket 104 fixed to dryer shaft 107 is then spun, which dehydrates the laundry. The dehydrated water is discharged through the numerous small holes punched on the side-wall of the basket 104.<br>
As such, clutch 115 controls the driving of agitator 105 or basket 104 so that the respective steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating can be performed.<br>
In this conventional construction, however, motor 114 is coupled to the driving mechanism via belt 113, which requires a lot of components and increases the cost. Further, motor 114 is placed off the rotational center line of basket 104, and the rotating force is transferred via belt 113 so that water tub 103 is hard to be balanced. <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the problems discussed above and aims to provide a washing machine comprising the following elements:<br>
(a) a dryer shaft for spinning the basket doubling as a washing basket and a spin-drying basket;<br><br>
4<br>
(b)	a washing shaft for spinning an agitator disposed in the basket,<br>
and disposed on the same axial line of the dryer shaft;<br>
(c)	a motor for driving the dryer shaft and the washing shaft;<br>
(d)	a speed reduction mechanism for reducing a driving speed of the<br>
motor and then rotating the washing shaft;<br>
(e)	a clutch for switching the transmission of the motor driving force<br>
either to the dryer shaft or to the washing shaft.<br>
The speed reduction mechanism is aligned with the motor on the same axial line, and the clutch is disposed within a motor bracket, one of elements of the motor. A clutch driver for driving the clutch is driven from outside the motor bracket.<br>
The construction discussed above of the washing machine of the present invention requires less numbers of components and restrains unbalance of the water tub at dehydration step. Further, if the water in water tub somehow would overflow the tub, the water is prevented from invading into the motor. If a user places his/her hand by mistake around the clutch, the fingers are prevented from entering into the motor. The safety of the washing machine is thus improved.<br>

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiments Exemplary   embodiments   of  the   present   invention   are   described<br>
hereinafter with reference to the accompanied drawings.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross section of an essential part of a washing machine in<br>
accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross section of the same washing machine.<br>
In Fig. 2, body 23 of the washing machine includes therein water tub 25<br>
supported by suspension 24 to prevent vibration at a dehydrating step.    In<br>
tub 25, basket 26 doubling as a washing basket and a spin-drying basket is<br>
rotatably disposed.    On the inner bottom of basket 26, agitator 27 for<br><br>
6<br>
agitating laundry is disposed rotatably.<br>
Basket 26 is fixed to an upper end of dryer shaft 29 journaled by bearing 28 disposed at a bottom section of water tub 25, as shown in Fig. 1. In hollow-dryer-shaft 29, washing shaft 31 journaled by bearing 30 disposed also in hollow-dryer-shaft 29 is placed on the same axis of shaft 29. Agitator 27 is mounted to an upper end of washing shaft 31.<br>
A lower end of washing shaft 31 is coupled to an output side of speed reduction mechanism 32, and input shaft 35 of the speed reduction mechanism is disposed at the input side thereof.<br>
Motor bracket 33 shapes as a cup, and its opening faces downwardly. Speed reduction mechanism 32 is mounted to an upper section of motor bracket 33. Stator 90 providing rotor 80 with rotational magnetic field is press-fitted into an inner wall of bracket 33. Motor 34 comprises stator 90 and rotor 80 facing each other via an annular space in-between. Input shaft 35 of the speed reduction mechanism is mounted to rotor 80, and speed reduction mechanism 32 is aligned with motor 34 on the same axial line. This relative location of speed reduction mechanism 32 and motor 34 is one of advantages of the present invention.<br>
Clutch 36 transmits the motor rotation to either dryer shaft 29 or washing shaft 31 by switching.    Clutch 36 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch boss 37;<br>
(b)	clutch spring 38; and<br>
(c)	sleeve 40 for transmitting the force of a clutch driver 39 to clutch spring<br>
38 for driving the clutch 36.   A tip section of input shaft 35 shows a circle in<br>
its cross sectional view, and is sided by shaving to form a quadrilateral so that<br>
clutch boss 37 having a hole mating with the shaved section is fixed to shaft<br>
35.   A first end of clutch spring 38 winds around clutch boss 37 and a second<br><br>
7<br>
end thereof winds around dryer shaft 29.   Clutch 36 is disposed within motor bracket 33.<br>
Clutch driver 39 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch claw 41;<br>
(b)	clutch lever 42;<br>
(c)	clutch switcher (not shown) including, e.g. a geared motor for<br>
rotating clutch lever 42; and<br>
(d)	clutch lever spring 43.<br>
Clutch driver 39 operates as follows: Provide motor bracket 33 with hole 44, and insert clutch lever 42 into hole 44. Drive clutch driver 39 by the clutch switcher from outside so that clutch lever 42 can rotate.<br>
The washing machine including the construction discussed above in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment works as follows:<br>
In the cleansing and rinsing steps, clutch driver 39 releases spring 38 so that rotational force does not travel to dryer shaft 29. In other words, clutch lever spring 43 urges claw 41 to be engaged with sleeve 40 and to loosen clutch spring 38. As a result, slipping occurs between spring 38 and boss 37. The rotating force of motor 34 thus travels only to agitator 27 via washing shaft 31, which provides the laundry with mechanical force. The laundry in basket 26 thus undergoes the cleansing and rinsing steps.<br>
After the cleansing and rinsing steps, spin-drying is taken place. In the spin-drying step, the clutch switcher rotates clutch lever 42 so that claw 41 comes off from sleeve 40, and spring 38 winds around boss 37. Then shaft 35 is coupled with dryer shaft 29 so that the rotating force of motor 34 travels to dryer shaft 29.   Basket 26 mounted to dryer shaft 29 is then rotated.<br>
Water dehydrated from the laundry is discharged through numerous small holes punched on a side-wall of basket 26 into water tub 25 due to<br><br>
8<br>
centrifugal force generated by spinning of basket 26. The laundry is thus automatically dehydrated. As such, the laundry loaded into basket 26 automatically undergoes respective steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating.<br>
The specific structures utilized in this embodiment produce the following advantages: Washing shaft 31 and dryer shaft 29 are concentrically placed because of the hollow structure of dryer shaft 29. Speed reduction mechanism 32 and motor 34 are placed in this order from agitator 27. They are aligned on the same axial line so that motor 34 and speed reduction mechanism 32 are integrated and the center of gravity of these two elements is located on the center line of water tub 25. Therefore, although the conventional structure have suffered unbalance of the water tub because the motor was not on the center line of the water tub, water tub 25 does not suffer unbalance anymore, and vibration at dehydrating step can be restrained.<br>
This structure can save a belt, and the rotating force of motor 34 is directly transmitted to washing shaft 31 and dryer shaft 29, therefore, a number of components can be reduced.<br>
Since motor 34 is disposed within motor bracket 33, if the water somehow overflows the tub 25, this structure blocks the water from advancing into the motor 34. Further, if users touch around clutch lever 42 by mistake, this structure can block the fingers from coming into motor 34. The safety of the washing machine is thus improved.<br>
Clutch driver 39 is inserted through hole 44 punched on motor bracket 33, so that only clutch lever 42 extends through hole 44 after the insertion, which increases the reliability of clutch 36, and forms a compact size driving mechanism assembled in the axial direction.<br><br>
