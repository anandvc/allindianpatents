METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONNECTING AN ELECTRICAL<br>
CONDUCTOR TO A METAL BAR. AND TOOL FOR FASTENING A<br>
BUSHING IN A HOLE IN A METAL BAR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and a device for connecting an electrical conductor to a<br>
metal bar, e.g. a railway track rail, by bolted connection. The invention also<br>
relates to a tool for fastening a bushing in a hole in the metal bar. The<br>
bushing forms part of the bolted connection.<br>
Within the railway field there is a need to connect electric cables to<br>
railway track rails. The resulting electrically conducting connection may form<br>
part of, for example, a signalling system for indicating the presence of traffic,<br>
earthing of rails or feeding back of high operating currents.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
Existing methods for effecting desired connections include the welding<br>
of steel cables or steel cable lugs and the soldering of cables or cable lugs.<br>
There are also various forms of keyed connection, bolted connection and<br>
combinations of these.<br>
Connections are assembled outdoors in unprotected environments<br>
under time pressure. It is not unusual that constituent parts are subject to<br>
damage, oxidation or contamination during transport or assembly.<br>
Connections are also subject to severe vibration due to passing trains and to<br>
mechanical effects caused by, for example, brushing, snow clearance or<br>
other track maintenance work. There may additionally be environmental<br>
influences which have adverse effects on electrical and mechanical<br>
characteristics, e.g. water penetrating via moisture gaps and possibly leading<br>
to corrosion or destructive ice expansion, the effects of cyclic temperature<br>
patterns (day/night, summer/winter), pollution of air, ground and water, etc.<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
2<br>
The bolted connections most commonly used comprise a bushing<br>
which is pressed firmly into a hole in the rail, and a bolted connection which<br>
connects a cable to the bushing via a cable lug. Assembly is usually effected<br>
by means of a hand-operated hydraulic tool.<br>
A bolted connection of this type is referred to and described in<br>
EP0945919. Here the bushing is provided with a collar at one end, and the<br>
opposite end, which is pushed through a hole in the rail, is accommodated at<br>
the other side of the rail by a cover ring. An expansion tool is drawn through<br>
the bushing from the collared end. The material of the bushing flows out<br>
powerfully and fills a space in the cover ring. The space extends radially<br>
outside the hole in the rail, thereby anchoring the bushing in the hoie. A<br>
disadvantage of the bolted connection according to EP0945919 is that the<br>
collar and the cover ring are deformed by the operation of drawing the<br>
expansion tool through. The result is that a cable lug or the like will not have<br>
good abutment against the collar. The bolted connection is intended for the<br>
fitting of a cable lug on each side of the rail.<br>
A similar bolted connection is described in EP0328946. However, this<br>
bolted connection is intended for the fitting of a cable lug on only one side.<br>
The bushing used in EP0328946 has a cylindrical portion somewhat longer<br>
than the length of the hole formed in the rail, and a terminating collar at one<br>
end. An expansion tool drawn through the bushing from the collared end<br>
causes material of the bushing to flow so that radial widening is caused at the<br>
opposite end of the bushing. The bolted connection is locked by a cup<br>
washer or the like. This connection likewise involves deformation of the<br>
collar. With a view to avoiding problems caused by the deformation,1 the<br>
collar of the bushing is provided from the outset with a thicker central portion<br>
and a hole which is countersunk at the aperture.<br>
EP0891007 refers to and describes a bolted connection for fitting<br>
cable lugs on both sides. Two bushings with collars are disposed coaxially<br>
inside one another in a hole in the rail. An expansion tool is drawn through<br>
the bushings, presses them together and presses them radially outwards in<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
3<br>
the hole. A disadvantage of this version is that one of the cable lugs is<br>
provided with a further contact surface in the electrical conductor path<br>
against the rail.<br>
The object of a bolted connection with a bushing is to create between<br>
a cable lug and a rail a mechanically durable connection with a low electrical<br>
transition resistance which does not increase over time. The electrical<br>
transition resistance occurs where two electrical conductors meet. The<br>
transition resistance of the bolted connection usually occurs at two<br>
transitions, one of them between the cabie lug and the bushing, the other<br>
between the bushing and ihe rail.<br>
Factors affecting the transition resistance comprise not only materials<br>
and surface evenness but also such aspects as surface cleanliness, size of<br>
contact surface and contact pressure. It is also important that the connection<br>
be capable of maintaining sufficient contact pressure between the constituent<br>
electrically conducting parts for a service life of perhaps 20 years.<br>
The bolted connections hitherto used in this context generally exhibit a<br>
number of deficiencies. Inter alia, the locking of the bolted connection is<br>
imperfect and there is risk of loosening as a result of the vibrations to which<br>
the connection is subject. Differences in material characteristics of rails,<br>
bushings and bolts also cause problems in that the electrical connection is<br>
impaired after temperature changes.  There is also risk of the bushing used<br>
in bolted connections of this kind losing engagement with the rail, thereby<br>
jeopardising the electrical function.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to eliminate the deficiencies and.<br>
problems indicated above. This object is achieved by a bushing being, as a<br>
first step, expanded radially to very good abutment against the shell surface<br>
of a hole formed in a metal bar, and by the bushing thereafter being face-<br>
ground at a collared first end and being widened radially at a second end.<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
4<br>
The grinding of the collar will result in very good electrical contact with the<br>
abutting cable lug or similar device on a cable.<br>
When a bolt pushed through the bushing is tightened, its axial<br>
movement will cause the bolt to engage in a clamp ring inserted in the<br>
bushing and achieve good electrical connection with the metal bar via the<br>
bushing. The bolt is tightened by a nut which abuts against the collar of the<br>
bushing via a washer and a cable lug which is disposed between the washer<br>
and the collar of the bushing. The bolt is tightened at relatively high torque<br>
and to a high prestress so that the washer rotates and grinds away<br>
contamination and unevennesses on the cabie iug. The cable lug is<br>
deformed and thereby comes to abut tightly against the whole surface of the<br>
washer.<br>
One embodiment of the connection device according to the invention<br>
is intended for fitting a cable lug on one side, and another embodiment of the<br>
device is intended for fitting two cabie lugs, i.e. one cable lug on each side of<br>
the metal bar. Either case involves a bolt which in a bolted connection holds<br>
together the connection device.<br>
In one embodiment, the bolt is made of a material which allows such a<br>
high assembly force as to result in plastic deformation of the cable lug or lugs<br>
against a washer and a flange. The cable lug thus abuts fully against the<br>
washer and the flange, with no spring-back. Cases where cable lugs are<br>
fitted on both sides involve using a flanged clamp ring, which then replaces<br>
the clamp ring described above which is used in cases where a cable lug is<br>
fitted on only one side.<br>

THE INVENTION<br>
The embodiment of the invention depicted in Fig. 1 is intended for<br>
cases where a cable lug is fitted on only one side. A bushing 10 is fitted in a<br>
hole in a metal bar 11 in a manner described below. With advantage, the<br>
edges of the hole are somewhat chamfered. The metal bar may take the<br>
form of a rail, in which case the hole is formed in the web of the rail. The<br>
bushing 10 takes the form of a cylindrical hollow body with a collar or flange<br>
12 at a first end (see also Fig. 8) and a straight termination at a second end.<br>
In this situation, the bushing 10 already abuts tightly against the wall of the<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
5<br>
hole or the shell surface of the metal bar and has good electrical connection<br>
with the latter.<br>
A tapered clamp ring 13 has a first end provided with an outside<br>
diameter substantially corresponding to the inside diameter of the bushing 10<br>
at the end with the straight termination when the bushing is fitted in position.<br>
The opposite second end of the clamp ring 13 has a larger outside diameter<br>
and cannot be pressed into the bushing 10 without considerable force. The<br>
length of the clamp ring 13 is less than the length of the bushing. With<br>
advantage, the length of the damp ring is less than half or approximately<br>
one-third of the iength of the bushing. A bolt 14 with a head 15 at one end<br>
and a threaded second end has its threaded end inserted through the clamp<br>
ring 13 and the bushing 10.<br>
A cable lug 16 which has running through it an aperture whose<br>
diameter allows the bolt to pass through abuts against the flange 12. The<br>
cable lug 16 may take a variety of forms but will have a first flat surface for<br>
abutment against the flange 12. The cable lug 16 has running from it an<br>
electrical conductor or cable 17 which is intended to form part of an electric<br>
circuit in a manner not depicted in more detail.<br>
The cable lug 16 is also provided with a second flat surface on the<br>
opposite side from the first flat surface. The second flat surface has abutting<br>
against it a washer 18 which accommodates, in a hole running through it, the<br>
bolt 14. Finally, a nut 19 is screwed in a conventional manner on the<br>
threaded end of the bolt 14. Tightening the nut 19 causes the head 15 of the<br>
bolt to press the tapered clamp ring 13 into the bushing 10. The clamp ring<br>
will then partly fill the space between the bushing and the bolt and will also<br>
exert a permanently high outward pressure between the bushing and the<br>
shell surface of the hole, and between the bolt and the clamp ring. The<br>
clamp ring will be deformed both against the bolt and against the bushing,<br>
thereby creating good electrical connection between them.<br>
The sections of the bushing and the clamp ring situated outside the<br>
hole constitute a bulge which further secures the bushing in the axial<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
7<br>
direction. Tightening the nut also causes the washer to rotate, with the result<br>
that the contact surfaces between the washer and the cable lug are ground<br>
clean and assume a common profile. The washer may also be firmly<br>
connected to, or form an integral part of, the nut.<br>
Like the bushing, the tapered clamp ring 13 is made of copper or other<br>
material with similar strength and good electrical conductivity. When the bolt<br>
14 is tightened, its head 15 will be pressed into the clamp ring 13 and the<br>
bushing 10 so that the bolt 14 is locked against rotation (see also Fig. 6).<br>
The bushing 10 is provided with an outside diameter corresponding to<br>
the inside diameter of the hole in the metal bar and can be pressed through<br>
the hole without any special tool. The means used for pressing the bushing<br>
10 outwards radially and ensuring good electrical and mechanical contact<br>
with the metal bar 11 is an assembly too! depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.<br>
The assembly tool comprises a fitting nut 20 with a countersunk<br>
threaded portion 21. The threaded portion is situated at an internal waist of<br>
the fitting nut. On either side of the waist there are clearance holes larger in<br>
diameter than the waist. A first end surface 31 of the fitting nut 20 is flat and<br>
intended to abut against the flange 12 of the bushing during the assembly<br>
operation. The opposite end of the fitting nut 20 is provided with a head 22<br>
which in the embodiment depicted is hexagonal for cooperation with a<br>
conventional tool.<br>
The assembly tool also comprises an elongate expansion device 23.<br>
The expansion device 23 is provided with a threaded portion 26 at a first end<br>
and a wrench spigot 24 at a second end. Between the ends, the expansion<br>
device 23 is provided with an expansion collar 25 which is linked to the<br>
threaded portion 26 by a conical transition. An elongate shank runs between<br>
the expansion collar 25 and the wrench spigot 24. The outside diameter of<br>
the threaded portion 26 is smaller than the inside diameter of the clearance<br>
holes formed in the fitting nut 20. This means that the expansion device 23<br>
can move freely through the fitting nut when the latter is rotated during the<br>
process of expanding the bushing (see also Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
8<br>
Assembling the bolted connection may be effected in the following<br>
manner with reference to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. A hole of suitable diameter is<br>
formed in a metal bar 11, e.g. a rail web. The edges of the hole are<br>
chamfered to prevent local stress concentrations. A so-called gauge<br>
comprising a rod made in two portions with circular cross-sections of different<br>
sizes is used for checking the hole diameter. A first portion has a diameter<br>
corresponding to the smallest permissible diameter for the hole formed in the<br>
metal bar, and a second portion has a diameter corresponding to the largest<br>
permissible hole diameter. The bushing 10 is drawn over the expansion<br>
device 23 so that its end with the straight termination abuts against the<br>
expansion collar 25, and the threaded portion 26 of the expansion device 23<br>
is screwed together with the fitting nut 20. In this situation, the flange 12 of<br>
the bushing 10 abuts against the flat end surface of the fitting nut 20.<br>
The fitting nut 20 screwed together with the expansion device 23 is<br>
inserted through the hole in the metal bar 11 so that the end of the bushing<br>
with the straight termination protrudes somewhat from one side of the metal<br>
bar and the flange of the bushing abuts against an opposite side of the metal<br>
bar. Using the bolted connection according to the invention on railway track<br>
rails entails the fitting nut and the expansion device with the bushing being<br>
pushed through the rail from the outside, which means that the wrench spigot<br>
24	of the expansion device 23 will be between the bars of the rail. This<br>
means that the safest possible way of working on the bolted connection will<br>
be that the person fitting the bolted connection can be outside the rail during<br>
the whole course of the operation.<br>
Initially holding a tool about the wrench spigot and turning the fitting<br>
nut 20 by means of a tool applied to the head 22 causes the expansion<br>
device 23 to be drawn through the bushing 10. When the expansion collar<br>
25	passes through the bushing 10, the result is radial widening and plastic<br>
deformation of the bushing and very good abutment against the shell surface<br>
of the hole. When the expansion collar has passed through, the section of<br>
the bushing which protrudes outside the metal bar will have been widened<br>
radially and shortened axially so as to form a bulge or small flange 27 which<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
9<br>
reliably prevents the bushing from sliding out of the hole. The small flange<br>
27 also has an advantageous function in connection with screwing up the bolt<br>
14, since the bolthead 15 will sink somewhat in it and thereby be prevented<br>
from rotating.<br>
During the rotation of the fitting nut 20, the flange 12 of the bushing 10<br>
will be polished to a completely clean and flat surface so that a cable lug<br>
fitted to the flange will have very good abutment against, and hence very<br>
good electrical connection with, the flange 12. A similar effect is achieved<br>
when the bolt 14 is screwed up and the-washer 18 rotates against the upper<br>
side of the cable lug.<br>
 In the situation depicted in Fig. 5, the expansion device 23 has been<br>
drawn so far that the expansion collar 25 has passed through the hole of the<br>
bushing 10 and is in a clearance hole of the fitting nut In this situation the<br>
fitting nut with the expansion device screwed in it is easy to remove from the<br>
bushing 10. The plastic deformation of the bushing results in a radial force<br>
acting between the bushing and the shell surface of the hole. In addition, the<br>
bushing 10 is fixed securely in position in the metal bar by the flange 12 and<br>
a small flange formed on the opposite side.<br>
Thereafter the tapered clamp ring 13 is fitted to the bolt 14 so that the<br>
wider portion of the clamp ring 13 abuts against the bolthead 15, and the bolt<br>
14 is inserted through the bushing 10. The narrower portion of the clamp ring<br>
13 has an outside diameter which corresponds to, or is slightly smaller than,<br>
the inside diameter of the bushing after the expansion device 23 has passed<br>
through. The thicker portion of the clamp ring has an outside diameter which<br>
is larger than the inside diameter of the bushing after the expansion device<br>
has passed through. This means that a certain force has to be exerted in<br>
order to press the clamp ring into the bushing.<br>
The length of the bolt 14 is such that it protrudes at the opposite side<br>
of the metal bar sufficiently to enable a cable lug 16, a washer 18 and a nut<br>
19 to be fitted to it, as depicted in Fig. 6. In the embodiment depicted (see<br>
also Fig. 1), the cable lug 16 is provided in a conventional manner with two<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
10<br>
mutually opposite flat sides. A first fiat side abuts against the poiished<br>
portion of the flange 12 of the bushing 10, and a second fiat side has a<br>
washer 18 placed against it in a conventional manner. Thereafter a nut 19 is<br>
screwed on the bolt 14 in a conventional manner.<br>
When the bolt 14 and the nut 19 are tightened, the washer 18 wiil<br>
rotate and thereby grind and polish the cable lug. The bolthead 15 will be<br>
drawn into and become countersunk in the small flange 27 formed on the<br>
bushing by the expansion operation, thereby preventing rotation of the bott.<br>
The bolt may be made of high-strength material, thereby making it possible<br>
for very great prestress force to be applied and ensuring very good electrical<br>
and mechanicai connection. The great prestress force also makes desired<br>
plastic deformation of the cable lug possible.<br>
The shapes of, and the collaboration between, the bolt and the clamp<br>
ring increase considerably the total transition surface of the connection which<br>
is avaiiable for electric current as compared with previously known bolted<br>
connections. The bushing and the clamp ring also ensure that no narrow<br>
gaps occur between the connection and the metal bar. The risk of capillary<br>
moisture and other remaining moisture which might cause problems is thus<br>
also prevented.<br>
Fig. 7 depicts a suitable embodiment of the clamp ring 13. The clamp<br>
ring is conical in the longitudinal direction and circular in cross-section.  It is<br>
made of copper or similar material with good electrical conductivity and<br>
softness enabling rHo flow out in the manner described above.<br>
An example of an embodiment of the bushing 10 is depicted in Fig. 8.<br>
The bushing 10 is cylindrical and is provided at one end with a flange 12.<br>
The bushing has running through it a hole which at the flanged end is<br>
provided with a recess 28 with a larger diameter. The portion 28 with larger<br>
diameter corresponds in length to the length of the flange, with the result that<br>
the expansion collar 25 of the expansion device 23 does not cause any radial<br>
expansion of the bushing outside the region which is enclosed by the metal<br>
bar. The shape of the portion 28 also ensures a completely flat outer flange<br><br>
WO 2006/057592	PCT/SE2005/001678<br>
11<br>
surface even after the expansion device 23 has passed through. Any outflow<br>
of material caused by the expansion device can be accommodated in that<br>
portion. Another advantage achieved is that the work involved in using the<br>
expansion device is not increased unnecessarily, since only the section of<br>
the bushing which is within the metal bar is subjected to the radial widening.<br>
The bushing 10 is also made of copper or similar material with good electrical<br>
conductivity and softness enabling it to flow out in the manner described<br>
above.<br>
According to the invention, the threaded connection may also be<br>
designed for fitting cabie iugs on both sides. Such an embodiment involves<br>
using a modified damp ring 29 depicted in Fig. 9. Like the clamp ring 13, the<br>
clamp ring 29 has a conical portion, but the conical portion leads to a straight<br>
cylindrical portion terminated by a clamp ring flange 30.<br>
All the contact surfaces (i.e. all the abutting surfaces between the<br>
metai bar, the boit and the cable lug 16 respectively) of the bushing 10, the<br>
clamp ring 13 and the flanged clamp ring are silver-plated, thereby ensuring<br>
very good electrical conductivity.<br>
The bolt plays an active part in the electrical contact between the<br>
cable lug and the metal bar, since it has good electrical connection not only<br>
with the upper side of the cabie jug via ihe nut and the washer but also with<br>
the metal bar via the clamp ring and the bushing. As the bolt plays an active<br>
part in the eiectricai contact, both sides of the cable lug can be used for<br>
eiectricai conduction, thereby reducing the total transition resistance. The<br>
two sides of the cable lug are mutually opposite, which means that, with the<br>
same prestress force, a larger surface can be used as transition surface for<br>
electric current without the outward pressure decreasing. "I his effect may be<br>
further enhanced by using a bolt made of high-strength material.<br><br>
