FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to new .pyrrole, derivatives that inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and to the use of the compounds and compositions, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents. The compounds and compositions provided by the present invention have utility in the treatment of disorders mediated by GSK3 activity, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, essential hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, syndrome X, ischemia, especially cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, bipolar disorder, immunodeficiency and cancer.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/threomne kinase for which two isoforms, a and p, have been identified. Woodgett, Trends Biochem. Sci., 16:177-81 (1991). Both GSK3 isoforms are constitutively active in resting cells. GSK3 was originally identified as a kinase that inhibits glycogen synthase by direct phosphorylation. Upon insulin activation, GSK3 is inactivated, thereby allowing the activation of glycogen synthase and possibly other insulin-dependent events, such glucose transport. Subsequently, it has been shown that GSK3 activity is also inactivated by other growth factors that, like insulin, signal through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Examples of such signaling molecules include IGF-1 and EGF. Saito et al., Biochem. J., 303:27-31 (1994); Welsh ct al., Biochem. J. 294:625-29 (1993); and Cross et al., Biochem. /., 303:21-26(1994).<br>
Agents that inhibit GSK3 activity are useful in the treatment of disorders that are mediated by GSK3 activity. In addition, inhibition of GSK3 mimics the activation of growth factor signaling pathways and consequently GSK3 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of diseases in which such pathways are insufficiently active. Examples of diseases that can be treated with GSK3 inhibitors are described below. ^DIABETES<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disease that is defined by the presence of chronically elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglyccmia). This state of<br>
-1-<br><br>
hyperglycemia is the result of a relative or absolute lack of activity of the peptide hormone, insulin. Insulin is produced and secreted by the 8 cells of the pancreas. Insulin is reported to promote glucose utilization, protein synthesis, and the formation and storage of carbohydrate energy as glycogen. Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen, a form of polyjnerized .glucose, which may be converted back into glucose to meet metabolism requirements. Under normal conditions, insulin is secreted at both a basal rate and at enhanced rates following glucose stimulation, all to maintain metabolic homeostasis by the conversion of glucose into glycogen.<br>
The term diabetes mellitus encompasses several different hyperglycemic states. These states include Type 1 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or IDDM) and Type 2 (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM) diabetes. The hyperglycemia present in individuals with Type 1 diabetes is associated with deficient, reduced, or nonexistent levels of insulin that are insufficient to maintain blood glucose levels within the physiological range. Conventionally, Type 1 diabetes is treated by administration of replacement doses of insulin, generally by a parental route. Since GSK3 inhibition stimulates insulin-dependent processes, it is consequently useful in the treatment of type 1 diabetes.<br>
Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent disease of aging. It is initially characterized by decreased sensitivity to insulin and a compensatory elevation in circulating insulin concentrations, the latter of which is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Increased insulin levels are caused by increased secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, and the resulting hyperinsulinemia is associated with cardiovascular complications of diabetes. As insulin resistance worsens, the demand on the pancreatic beta cells steadily increases until the pancreas can no longer provide adequate levels of insulin, resulting in elevated levels of glucose in the blood. Ultimately, overt hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia occur, leading to the devastating long-term complications associated with diabetes, including cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. The exact mechanism(s) causing type 2 diabetes are unknown, but result in impaired glucose transport into skeletal muscle and increased hepatic glucose production, in addition to inadequate insulin response. Dietary modifications are often ineffective, therefore the majority of patients ultimately require pharmaceutical intervention in an effort to prevent and/or slow the progression of the complications of the disease. Many patients can be treated with one or more of the many oral anti-diabetic<br>
-2-<br><br>
agents available, including sulfonylureas, to increase insulin secretion. Examples of sulfonylurea drugs include metformin for suppression of hepatic glucose production, and troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing medication. Despite the utility of these agents, 30-40% of diabetics are not adequately controlled using these medications and require subcutaneous insulin injections. Additionally, each of these therapies has associated side effects. 'For example, sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia and troglitazone can cause severe hepatoxicity. Presently, there is a need for new and improved drugs for the treatment of prediabetic and diabetic patients.<br>
As described above, GSK3 inhibition stimulates insulin-dependent processes and is consequently useful in the treatment of1 type 2 diabetes. Recent data obtained using lithium salts provides evidence for this notion. The lithium ion has recently been reported to inhibit GSK3 activity. Klein et al., PNAS 93:8455-9 (1996). Since 1924, lithium has been reported to have antidiabetic effects including the ability to reduce plasma glucose levels, increase glycogen uptake, potentiate insulin, up-regulate glucose synthase activity and to stimulate glycogen synthesis in skin, muscle and fat cells. However, lithium has not been widely accepted for use in the inhibition of GSK3 activity, possibly because of its documented effects on molecular targets other than GSK3. The purine analog 5-iodotubercidin, also a GSK3 inhibitor, likewise stimulates glycogen synthesis and antagonizes inactivation of glycogen synthase by glucagon and vasopressin in rat liver cells. Fluckiger-Isler et al., Biochem .7292:85-91 (1993); and Massillon et al., Biochem 7299:123-8 (1994). However, this compound has also been shown to inhibit other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Massillon et al., Biochem J 299:123-8 (1994).<br>
One of the main goals in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus is to achieve blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. In general, obtaining normal postprandial blood glucose levels is more difficult than normalizing fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, some epidemiological studies suggest that postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) or hyperinsulinemia are independent risk factors for the development of macro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Recently, several drugs with differing pharmacodynamic profiles have been developed which target PPHG. These include insulin lispro, amylin analogues, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and meglitinide analogues. Insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of action and shorter duration of efficacy compared with regular human insulin. In clinical trials, the use of<br>
-3-<br><br>
insulin lispro has been associated with improved control of PPHG and a reduced incidence of hypoglycemic episodes. Repaglinide, a meglitinide analogue, is a short-acting insulinotropic agent which, when given before meals, stimulates endogenous insulin secretions and lowers postprandial hyperglycemic excursions. Both insulin lispro and repaglinide are associated with postprandial hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, amylin analogues reduce PPHG by slowing gastric emptying and delivery of nutrients to the absorbing surface of the gut. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose, miglitol and voglibose also reduce PPHG primarily by interfering with the carbohydrate-digesting enzymes and delaying glucose absorption. Yamasaki et al., Tohoku J Exp Med 1997 Nov; 183(3):173-83. The GSK inhibitors of the present invention are also useful, alone or in combination with the agents set forth above, in the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia as well as in the treatment of fasting hyperglycemia. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE<br>
GSK3 is also involved in biological pathways relating to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The characteristic pathological features of AD are extracellular plaques oFan abnormally processed form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), so called 6-amyloid peptide (8-AP) and the development of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing paired helical filaments (PHF) that consist largely of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. GSK3 is one of a number of kinases that have been found to phosphorylate tau protein in vitro on the abnormal sites characteristic of PHF tau, and is the only kinase also demonstrated to do this in living cells and in animals. Lovestone et at., Current Biology 4:1077-86 (1994); and Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8: 3251-3255 (1997). Furthermore, the GSK3 kinase inhibitor, LiCl, blocks tau hyperphosphorylation in cells. Stambolic et al., Current Biology 6:1664-8 (1996). Thus GSK3 activity may contribute to the generation of neurofibrillary tangles and consequently to disease progression. Recently it has been shown that GSK38 associates with another key protein in AD pathogenesis, presenillinl (PS1). Takashima et al., WAS 95:9637-9641 (1998). Mutations in the PS 1 gene lead to increased production of B-AP, but the authors also demonstrate that the mutant PS1 proteins bind more tightly to GSK3B and potentiate the phosphorylation of tau, which is bound to the same region of PS 1.<br>
Interestingly it has also been shown that another GSK3 substrate, B-catenin, binds to PS1. Zhong et al., Nature 395:698-702 (1998). Cytosolic 6-catenin is targeted for degradation upon phosphorylation by GSK3 and reduced J3-catenin activity is associated<br>
-4-<br><br>
with increased sensitivity of neuronal cells to B-AP induced neuronal apoptosis. Consequently, increased association of GSK# with mutant PS1 may account for the reduced levels of ß -catenin that have been observed in the brains of PS 1-mutant AD patients and to the disease related increase in neuronal cell-death. Consistent with these observations, it has been shown that injection of GSK3 antisense but not sense, blocks the pathological effects of #-AP on neurons in vitro, resulting in a 24 hr delay in the onset of cell dealt. Takashima et al., PNAS 90:7789-93, {1993). In these latter studies, the effects on cell-death are preceded (within 3-6 hours of B-AP administration) by a doubling of intracellular GSK3 activity, suggesting that in addition to genetic mechanisms may increase GSK3 activity. Further evidence for a role for GSK3 in AD is provided by the observation that the protein expression level (but, in this case, not specific activity) of GSK3 is increased by 50% in postsynaptosomal supematants of AD vs. normal brain tissue. Pei et al, JNeuropathol Exp 56:70-78 (1997).<br>
Even more recently, it has been shown that therapeutic concentrations of lithium, a known GSK3 inhibitor, bock the production of B-AP by interfering with, amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Phiel et al., Nature 423(22): 435-438 (2003). Since GSK3 also phosphorylates tau protein, the principal component of neuroflbrillary tangles, inhibition of GSK3 provides both a reduction in amyloid plaques and neurofibnllary tangles, and is useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. OTHER CNS DISORDERS<br>
In addition to the effects of lithium described above, there is a long history of the use of lithium to treat bipolar disorder (manic depressive syndrome). Thus clinical response to lithium may reflect an involvement of GSK3 activity in the etiology of bipolar disorder, in which case GSK3 inhibitors could be relevant to that indication. In support of this notion it was recently shown tibat valproate, another drug commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, is also a GSK3 inhibitor. Chen et al., J. Neurochemistry 72:1327-1330 (1999). One mechanism by which lithium and other GSK3 inhibitors may act to treat bipolar disorder is to increase the survival of neurons subjected to aberrantly high levels of excitation induced by the neurotransmirter, glutamate. Nonaka et al., PNAS 95; 2642-2647 (1998) Glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxieity is also believed to be a major cause of neorodegeneratio associated with acute damage, such, as in cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and bacterial infection. Furthermore it is believed that excessive glutamate signaling is a factor in the chronic<br>
-5-<br><br>
associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thomas, J. Am. Geriatr: Soc. 43: 1279-89 (1995). Consequently GSK3 inhibitors are believed to be a useful treatment in these and other neurodegenerative disorders. IMMUNE POTENTIATION<br>
GSK3 phosphorylates transcription factor NF-AT and promotes its export from the nucleus, in opposition to the effect of calcineurin. Beals et al., Science 275:1930-33 (1997). Thus, GSK3 blocks early immune response gene activation via NF-AT, and GSK3 inhibitors may tend to permit or prolong activation of immune responses. Thus GSK3 inhibitors are believed to prolong and potentiate the immunostimulatory effects of certain cytokines, and such an effect may enhance the potential of those cytokines for tumor immunotherapy or indeed for immunotherapy in general. OTHER DISORDERS<br>
Lithium also has other biological effects. It is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis, both in vitro and in vivo. Hammond et al., Blood 55: 26-28 (1980). In dogs, lithium carbonate eliminated recurrent neutropenia and normalized other blood cell counts. Doukas et al. Exp Hematol 14: 215-221 (1986). If these effects of lithium are mediated through the inhibition of GSK3, GSK3 inhibitors may have even broader applications.<br>
Since inhibitors of GSK3 are useful in thejjreatment of _ rnanydiseases, the identification of new inhibitors of GSK3 would be highly desirable.<br>

for optimal alignment with the other polypeptide or nucleic acid). The amino acid<br>
residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are<br>
then compared. "When a position in one sequence is occupied by the same amino acid<br>
residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the other sequence, then the<br>
molecules are homologous at that position (i.e., as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid<br>
"homology" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid "identity"). The percent<br>
homology between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions<br>
shared by the sequences (i.e., % homology ~ # of identical positions/total # of positions x<br>
100) GSK3 was originally identified by its phosphorylation of glycogen synthase as<br>
described in Woodgett et al., Trends Biochem. Set, 16:177-81 (1991), incorporated<br>
herein by reference. By inhibiting GSK3 kinase activity, activities downstream of GSK3<br>
activity may be inhibited, or, alternatively, stimulated. For example, when GSK3 activity<br>
is inhibited, glycogen synthase may be activated, resulting in increased glycogen<br>
production. GSK3 is also known to act as a kinase in a variety of other contexts,<br>
including, for example, phosphorylation of c-jun, p-catenin, and tau protein. It is<br>
understood that inhibition of GSK3 kinase activity can lead to a variety of effects in a<br>
variety of biological contexts. The invention, however, is not limited by any theories of<br>
mechanism as to how the invention works.<br>

Compounds of the present invention can be readily synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are well known in the art.

Tet.Let 1984, 25, 2183; Have, R.; Leusink, F.R.; van Leusen, A.M. Synthesis 1996, 871-876; Mark Trudell, JOC, 1997, 62, 2649-2651; and Worrall, D.E.

GSK3 inhibitor compounds of the present invention can be purified using known methods, such as, for example, chrornatography, crystallization, and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit inhibitory activity that is relatively substantially selective with respect to GSK3, as compared to at least one other type of kinase. As used herein, the term "selective" refers to a relatively greater potency for inhibition against GSK3, as compared to at least one other type of kinase. Preferably, GSK3 inhibitors of the present invention are selective with respect to GSK3, as compared to at least two other types of kinases. Kinase activity assays for kinases other than GSK3 are generally known. See e.g., Havlicek et al., J. Med. Chem., 40:408-12 (1997), incorporated herein by reference. GSK3 selectivity can be quantitated according to the following: GSK3 selectivity = IC50 (other kmase) - IC50 (Gsio), where a GSK3 inhibitor is selective for GSK3 when IC50 (other kwase) - IC50 (CSK3)- Thus, an inhibitor that is selective for GSK3 exhibits a GSK3 selectivity of greater than 1 -fold with respect to inhibition of a kinase other than GSK3 As used herein, the term "other kinase" refers to a kinase other than GSK3. Such selectivities are generally measured in the cell-free assay described in Example 265.<br>
-31-<br><br>
Typically, GSK3 inhibitors of the present invention exhibit a selectivity of at least about 2-fold (i.e., IC50 (other kmase) - IC50 (GSK3)) for GSK3, as compared to another kinase and more typically they exhibit a selectivity of at least about 5-fold. Usually, GSK3 inhibitors of the present invention exhibit a selectivity for GSK3, as compared to at least one other kinase, of at least about i 0-fold, desirably at least about 100-fold, and more preferably, at least about 1000-fold.<br>
GSK3 inhibitory activity can be readily detected using the assays described herein, as well as assays generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary methods for identifying specific inhibitors of GSK3 include both cell-free and cell-based GSK3 kinase assays. A cell-free GSK3 kinase assay detects inhibitors that act by direct interaction with the polypeptide GSK3, while a cell-based GSK3 kinase assay may identify inhibitors that function by direct interaction with GSK3 itself, or by other mechanisms, including, for example, interference with GSK3 expression or with post-translational processing required to produce mature active GSK3 or alteration of the intracellular localization of GSK3.<br>
In general, a cell-free GSK3 kinase assay can be readily carried out by: (1) incubating GSK3 with a peptide substrate, radiolabeled ATP (such as, for example, y33P- or y32P-ATP, both available from Amersham, Arlington Heights, Illinois), magnesium ions, and optionally, one or more candidate inhibitors; (2) incubating the mixture for a period of time to allow incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into the peptide substrate by GSK3 activity; (3) transferring all or a portion of the enzyme reaction mix to a separate vessel, typically a microtiter well that contains a uniform amount of a capture ligand that is capable of binding to an anchor ligand on the peptide substrate; (4) washing to remove unreacted radiolabeled ATP; then (5) quantifying the amount of 33P or 32P remaining in each well. This amount represents the amount of radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into the peptide substrate. Inhibition is observed as a reduction in the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into the peptide substrate.<br>
Suitable peptide substrates for use in the cell free assay may be any peptide, polypeptide or synthetic peptide derivative that can be phosphorylated by GSK3 in the presence of an appropriate amount of ATP. Suitable peptide substrates may be based on portions of the sequences of various natural protein substrates of5GSK3, and may also contain N-terminal or C-terrninal modifications or extensions including spacer sequences<br>
-32-<br><br>
and anchor ligands. Thus, the peptide substrate may reside within a larger polypeptide, or may be an isolated peptide designed for phosphorylation by GSK3.<br>
For example, a peptide substrate can be designed based on a subsequence of the DNA binding protein CREB, such as the SGSG-linked CREB peptide sequence within the CREB DNA binding protein described in Wang et al., Anal. Biochem , 220:397-402 (1994), incorporated herein by reference. In the assay reported by Wang et a!., the C-terminal serine in the SXXXS motif of the CREB peptide is enzymatically prephosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a step which is required to render the N-terminal serine in the motif phosphorylatable by GSK3. As an alternative, a modified CREB peptide substrate can be employed which has the same SXXXS motif and which also contains an N-terminal anchor ligand, but which is synthesized with its C-terminal serine prephosphorylated (such a substrate is available commercially from Chiron Technologies PTY Ltd., Clayton, Australia). Phosphorylation of the second serine in the SXXXS motif during peptide synthesis eliminates the need to enzymatically phosphorylate that residue with PKA as a separate step, and incorporation of an anchor ligand facilitates capture of the peptide substrate after its reaction with GSK3.<br>
Generally, a peptide substrate used for a kinase activity assay may contain one or more sites that are phosphorylatable by GSK3, and one or more other sites that are phosphorylatable by other kinases, but not by GSK3. Thus, these other sites can be prephosphorylated in order to create a motif that is phosphorylatable by GSK3. The term "prephosphorylated" refers herein to the phosphorylation of a substrate peptide with non-radiolabeled phosphate prior to conducting a kinase assay using that substrate peptide. Such prephosphorylation can conveniently be performed during synthesis of the peptide substrate.<br>
The SGSG-linked CREB peptide can be linked to an anchor ligand, such as biotin, where the serine near the C terminus between P and Y is prephosphorylated. As used herein, the term "anchor ligand" refers to a ligand that can be attached to a peptide substrate to facilitate capture of the peptide substrate on a capture ligand, and which functions to hold the peptide substrate in place during wash steps, yet allows removal of unreacted radiolabeled ATP. An exemplary anchor ligand is biotin. The term "capture ligand" refers herein to a molecule'which can bind an anchor ligand with high affinity, and which is attached to a solid structure. Examples of bound capture ligands include, for example, avidin- or streptavidin-coated microtiter wells or agarose beads. Beads bearing<br>
-33-<br><br>
capture ligands can be further combined with a scintillant to provide a means for detecting captured radiolabeled substrate peptide, or scintillant can be added to the captured peptide in a later step.<br>
The captured radiolabeled peptide substrate can be quantitated in a scintillation counter using known methods. The signal detected in the scintillation counter will be proportional to GSK3 activity if the enzyme reaction has been run under conditions where only a limited portion (e.g., less than 20%) of the peptide substrate is phosphorylated. If an inhibitor is present during the reaction, GSK3 activity will be reduced, and a smaller quantity of radiolabeled phosphate will thus be incorporated into the peptide substrate. Hence, a lower scintillation signal will be detected. Consequently, GSK3 inhibitory activity will be detected as a reduction in scintillation signal, as compared to that observed in a negative control where no inhibitor is present during the reaction. This assay is described in more detail in Example 265 hereinbelow.<br>
A cell-based GSK3 kinase activity assay typically utilizes a cell that can express both GSK3 and a GSK3 substrate, such as, for example, a cell transformed with genes encoding GSK3 and its substrate, including regulatory control sequences for the expression of the genes. In carrying out the cell-based assay, the cell capable of expressing the genes is incubated in the presence of a compound of the present invention. The cell is lysed, and the proportion of the substrate in the phosphorylated form is determined, e.g., by observing its mobility relative to the unphosphorylated form on SDS PAGE or by determining the amount of substrate that is recognized by an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of the substrate. The amount of phosphorylation of the substrate is an indication of the inhibitory activity of the compound, i.e., inhibition is detected as a decrease in phosphorylation as compared to the assay conducted with no inhibitor present. GSK3 inhibitory activity detected in a cell-based assay may be due, for example, to inhibition of the expression of GSK3 or by inhibition of the kinase activity of GSK3.<br>
Thus, cell-based assays can also be used to specifically assay for activities that are implicated by GSK3 inhibition, such as, for example, inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation, potentiation of insulin signaling, and the like. For example, to assess the capacity of a GSK3 inhibitor to inhibit Alzheimer's-like phosphorylation of microrubule-associated protein tau, cells may be co-transfected with human GSK3p and human tau protein, then incubated with one or more candidate inhibitors. Various<br>
-34-<br><br>
mammalian cell lines and expression vectors can be used for this type of assay. For instance, COS cells may be transfected with both a human GSK3p expression plasmid according to the protocol described in Stambolic et al., 1996, CuiTent Biology 6:1664-68, which is incorporated herein by reference, and an expression plasmid such as pSG5 that contains human tau protein coding sequence under an early SV40 promoter. See also Goedert et al., EMBO J.t 8:393-399 (1989), which is incorporated herein by reference. Alzheimer's-like phosphorylation of tau can be readily detected with a specific antibody such as, for example, AT8, which is available from Polymedco Inc. (Cortlandt Manor, New York) after lysing the cells. This assay is described in greater detail in the examples, hereinbelow.<br>
Likewise, the ability of GSK3 inhibitor compounds to potentiate insulin signaling by activating glycogen synthase can be readily ascertained using a cell-based glycogen synthase activity assay. This assay employs cells that respond to insulin stimulation by increasing glycogen synthase activity, such as the CHO-HIRC cell line, which overexpresses wild-type insulin receptor (-100,000 binding sites/cell). The CHO-HIRC cell line can be generated as described in Moller et al., J. Biol Chem., 265:14979-14985 (1990) and Moller et al., Mol. Endocrinol, 4:1183-1191 (1990), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The assay can be carried out by incubating serum-starved CHO-HIRC cells in the presence of various concentrations of compounds of the present invention in the medium, followed by cell lysis at the end of the incubation period. Glycogen synthase activity can be detected in the lysate as described in Thomas et al., Anal. Biochem., 25:486-499 (1968). Glycogen synthase activity is computed for each sample as a percentage of maximal glycogen synthase activity, as described in Thomas et al., supra, and is plotted as a function of candidate GSK3 inhibitor concentration. The concentration of candidate GSK3 inhibitor that increased glycogen synthase activity to half of its maximal level (i.e., the EC50) can be calculated by fitting a four parameter sigmoidal curve using routine curve fitting methods that are well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. This is described in more detail in Example 266, hereinbelow.<br>
GSK3 inhibitors can be readily screened for in vivo activity such as, for example, using methods that are well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For example, candidate compounds having potential therapeutic activity in the treatment of type 2 diabetes can be readily identified by detecting a capacity to improve glucose tolerance in<br>
-35-<br><br>
animal models of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, the candidate compound can be dosed using any of several routes prior to administration of a glucose bolus in either diabetic mice (e.g. KK, db/db, ob/ob) or diabetic rats (e.g. Zucker Fa/Fa or GK). Following administration of the candidate compound and glucose, blood samples are removed at preselected time intervals and evaluated for serum glucose and insulin levels. Improved disposal of glucose in the absence of elevated secretion levels of endogenous insulin can be considered as insulin sensitization and can be indicative of compound efficacy. A detailed description of this assay is provided in the examples, hereinbelow.<br>

In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols that are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering.agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
-38-<br><br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, cyclodextrins, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
In accordance with yet other embodiments, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting GSK3 activity in a human or animal subject, said method comprising administering to a subject an amount of a GSK3 inhibitor compound having the structure (I), (II) or (HI) (or tautomers thereof or compositions comprising such compound) effective to inhibit GSK3 activity in the subject. Other embodiments provided methods for treating a cell or a GSK3-mediated disorder in a human or animal subject, comprising administering to the cell or to the human or animal subject an amount of a compound or composition of the invention effective to inhibit GSK3 activity in the cell or subject. Preferably, the subject will be a human or non-human animal subject. Inhibition of GSK3 activity includes detectable suppression of GSK3 activity either as compared to a control or as compared to expected GSK3 activity.<br>
Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any amount sufficient to detectably inhibit GSK3 activity by any of the assays described herein, by other GSK3 kinase activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art or by detecting an alleviation of symptoms in a subject afflicted with a GSK3-mediated disorder.<br>
GSK3-mediated disorders that may be treated in accordance with the invention include any biological or medical disorder in which GSK3 activity is implicated or in which the inhibition of GSK3 potentiates signaling through a pathway that is characteristically defective in the disease to be treated. The condition or disorder may either be caused or characterized by abnormal GSK3 activity. Representative GSK3-mediated disorders include, for example, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, essential hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, syndrome X, ischemia, especially cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, bipolar disorder, immunodeficiency, cancer and the like.<br>
Successful treatment of a subject in accordance with the invention may result in the inducement of a reduction or alleviation of symptoms in a subject afflicted with a medical or biological disorder to, for example, halt the further progression of the disorder,<br>
-39-<br><br>
or the prevention of the disorder. Thus, for example, treatment of diabetes can result in a reduction in glucose or HbAlc levels in the patient Likewise, treatment of Alzheimer's disease can result in a reduction in rate of disease progression, detected, for example, by measuring a reduction in the rate of increase of dementia.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeuticaUy effective amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, a therapeuticaUy effective dose will generally be from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 1 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and most preferably from about 2 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day of a GSK3 inhibitor compound of the present invention, which may be administered in one or multiple doses.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of hposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multilamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming Hposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.W., p. 33 et seq (1976).<br>
While the compounds of the mvention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more other agents used in the treatment of disorders. Representative agents useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of type 2 diabetes include, for example,<br>
-40-<br><br>
insulin, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, metformin, sulfonylurea, acarbose, and the like. Representative agents useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease include, for example, donepezil, tacrine and the like. Representative agents useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of bipolar disease include, for example, lithium salts, valproate, carbamazepine and the like. A representative agent useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of stroke is, for example, tissue plasminogen activator.<br>
"When additional active agents are used in combination with the compounds of the present invention, the additional active agents may generally be employed in therapeutic amounts as indicated in the PHYSICIANS1 DESK REFERENCE (PDR) 53rd Edition (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference, or such therapeutically useful amounts as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention and the other therapeutically active agents can be administered at the recommended maximum clinical dosage or at lower doses. Dosage levels of the active compounds in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain a desired therapeutic response depending on the route of administration, severity of the disease and the response of the patient. The combination can be administered as separate compositions or as a single dosage form containing both agents. When administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions that are given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic agents can be given as a single composition.<br>
The foregoing and other aspects of the invention may be better understood in connection with the following representative examples.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
SYNTHESIS OF PYRROLE<br><br><br>
Preparation of tert-buty\ (2E)-3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)prop-2-enoate (2).<br>
Neat DIC (1.4 eq) was added to a well stirred solution of cinnamate (1 eq), t-butyl alcohol (4 eq), DMAP (1 4 eq) and CH2CI2 under argon at it. (Note - The cinnamate must be completely in solution which may require gentle warming Allow the solution to<br>
-42-<br><br>
cool to room temperature before adding the DIC. To avoid an exotherm on larger scales, it may be prudent to dilute the DIC with CH2CI2 before the addition and have an ice bath ready.) After stirring for 8 hours, the reaction develops a white precipitate. The reaction may be monitored by TLC eluting with 25% EtOAc/Hexane (Rf of product was 0.9). The entire reaction was loaded into a separatory funnel (washing with CH2CI2). The organic mixture was washed with citrate, sat. aq. NaHCOs, water, and brine. The organic layer was dried (Na2SC&gt;4), filtered, and concentrated to dryness to give the crude product as an oil. The crude oil was mixed with hexane and stirred for 30 min. The precipitate which forms was filtered over celite and the filtrate was evaporated. The hexane mixture was loaded onto a filter plug of silica and eluted with EtOAc/hexane (97:2 v/v). The first eluted UV active fractions are collected and evaporated to give &gt;99% pure 2 (75-80% yields).<br><br>
Preparation of tert-butyl 4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)pyrrole-3-carboxylate (3).<br>
Dry ether was added to NaH (1.5 eq as the oil dispersion) under argon. After decanting off the ether via syringe, the NaH was suspended again with fresh ether under argon. A solution of TOSMIC (1.1 eq) and 2 (1 eq) dissolved in a mixture of ether and DMSO was added dropwise to the stirred suspension of NaH at 0 °C over 20-30 mm. The addition was mildly exothermic and evolved gas. After the addition, the reaction was allowed to warm to ambient rt. The progress of the reaction was followed by TLC (25% EtOAc/Hexane, the UV active product was at Rf = 0.4) and LCMS until done (-2-3 h). Upon completion, the reaction was carefully quenched with sat. aq. NH4C1 (added slowly to avoid strong gas evolution and exotherm) and diluted with ether. The layers were separated and the organic phase was washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3, water, and brine. The crude dark solid can be purified by recrystallization. Best results were achieved either through recrystallization directly from a mixture of hot EtOAc/hexane (1:3 v/v) or by dissolving the crude product in minimal hot EtOAc followed by addition of hexane (-2<br>
-43-<br><br>
volumes of hexane based on the volume of EtOAc). The hot solutions were allowed to cool to room temperature and age over night. The crystals were first filtered and then washed with hexane giving 99% pure product in 60-70 % yield.<br><br>
Preparation	of	tert-bntyl	4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-l-[3-(l,3-<br>
dioxobenzo[c]azolin-2-yI)propyl]pyrrole-3-carboxylate (4).<br>
Solid NaH (1.5 eq as the oil dispersion) was added in small portions to a solution of pyrrole 3 (1 eq) and 3-bromopropyl phthalimide (1.2 eq) dissolved in DMF stirred at room temperature and flushed with argon. NOTE - Some gas evolves, but the temperature does not seem to rise above 40-50 °C. The reaction was stirred for 1.5 h at room temperature under argon. The reaction was followed by TLC (Ct^Cla/acetonitrile (95:5 v/v), the UV active product was at Rf - 0.5) and LCMS. Upon completion, the reaction was quenched with sat. aq. NH4CI (add slowly to avoid strong gas evolution and exotherm). Sat. aq. NaHCO3 was then added to avoid an emulsion, and the basic organic mixture was extracted with ether. The combined ether layers were washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3, water, brine, dried Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to dryness to give the crude product. The crude product was purified by eluting through silica with EtOAc/Hexane (1:4 v/v). The purified product contained some residual 3-bromopropyl phthalimide, which did not interfere with subsequent synthetic steps. The material was taken on and used without further purification. Assume a quantitative yield.<br><br>
Preparation of (erf-butyl l-(3-aminopropyl)-4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)pyrrole-3-carboxylate (5).<br>
-44-<br><br>
The Pthalimido Pyrrole 4 (1 eq) was dissolved in ethanol and hydrazine (3 eq) at room temperature under nitrogen. Upon heating to reflux, the reaction generated a white precipitate. Stir at reflux until complete (-2 h) by TLC (CH2Cl2/acetonitrile (95:5 v/v), the UV active product was at Rf — 0.2) and LCMS. Upon reaching completion, the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate was vacuum-filtered off using a medium to fine cintered-glass filter. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a gummy solid. The crude material was taken up in ethanol/EtOAc (1:1 v/v), stirred and the precipitate was filtered off in the same fashion as before. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and than dried in vacuo for 10-15 min. This process of adding ethanol/EtOAc, filtering and concentrating was done one more time or as needed to remove the majority of the white precipitate and residual hydrazine. The product was then dried in vacuo overnight. The material was used without further purification. Once dried, the reaction yielded the product as a glass (-87% yield over 2 steps).<br><br>
Preparation of tert-butyl l-{3-[(6-amino-5-nitro(2-pyridyI))amino]propyl}-4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)pyrro!e-3-carboxylate (7).<br>
To the premixed dry reagents, pyrrole 5 (1 eq) and powdered 6-chloro-3-nitro-2-pyndylamine (6) (1.1 eq), was added the DMA followed by Hunig's base (2 eq) sequentially with stirring at rt. The reaction was then heated to 80 °C overnight. The reaction was followed by TLC (EtOAc/hexane (1:1 v/v), the UV active yellow product was at Rf = 0.25), HPLC and LCMS. Upon completion as judged by HPLC, the reaction was allowed to cool to 70 °C. Ethylene diamine (anhydrous) was then added to the reaction to destroy any remaining unreacted chloropyndine 6. After 15 min stirring at 70 °C, the reaction was cooled and quenched with the addition of sat. aq. NaHCO3. The aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organic layers were washed with sat. aq. NaHCCh, water, brine, dried, filtered, and concentrated to dryness to<br>

Preparation of 4-ethyl trans-beta-nitrostyrene (2).<br>
An aq. 6M NaOH solution (1.05 eq) was added to a methonolic solution of 4-ethylbenzaldehyde (1 eq) and nitromethane (1 eq) stirred at 0 °C. During the slow addition of base, maintain the temperature between 10-15 °C. The reaction generates a thick white precipitate. To allow smooth stirring, an additional amount of MeOH was added. After stirring for an additional 15 min., the ice bath was removed. Upon reaching RT, water was added to the reaction, which subsequently turned clear. The clear solution was added to a flask containing a stirred 6M aq. HC1 solution. A yellow crystalline precipitate formed. After 10 min., the crystalline product was filtered, washed thoroughly with water, suction dried and recrystallized from abs. EtOH. 4-ethyl trans-beta-nitrostyrene (2) was afforded as a yellow crystalline product in 52% yield and &gt;99% purity (LC/MS m/z 178.2 MH.<br>
Preparation of 4-(2j4-dichlorophenyI)-3-nitropyrrole (3)<br>
A solution of TOSMIC (1 eq) hi THF was added dropwise to a stirred solution of potassium tert-butoxide (2.4 eq) at -78°C under argon. After 10 nun., trans-beta-nitrostyrene (2) (1.05 eq) dissolved in THF was added dropwise After stirring for 15 min. at -78°C, the reaction was allowed to warm to -40 °C. The progress of the reaction was followed by TLC (25% EtOAc/Hexane, the UV active product was at Rf = 0.8). The reaction was then quenched with water, and the product was extracted with ether. The ether layer was subsequently washed with brine and dried over MgSC&gt;4, filtered, and concentrated to dryness to give a dark gum. The crude product was dissolved in refluxing EtOAc and left to cool. After 12 hours, the product had completely crystallized out of<br>

GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE ASSAY<br>
CHO-HIRC cells are maintained in 10 cm tissue culture plates in Ham's F12 medium/10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells from a confluent 10 cm plate are harvested and divided into the 6 wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate to a final volume of 2 ml of medium. The cells are left to grow at 37°C for 24 hours. The cells are then washed three times in Ham's F12 medium containing no fetal bovine serum, and finally the cells are left for a further 24 hours at 37°C in 2 ml of the serum-free medium.<br>
At the end of this time, 20 # of compound dissolved in DMSO is added to each well and incubated at 37°C. After 20 minutes the medium is removed and the cells are washed once in PBS at room temperature and then rapidly frozen in the plates in liquid nitrogen. Cells are then thawed on ice in the presence of 140 yl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.8; 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 25 jig/ml leupeptin, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) per well. Cells are scraped from the plates and frozen in Eppendorf tubes on dry ice. Lysates are then thawed and refrozen on dry ice.<br>
After rethawing, lysates are spun at 14,000 g for 15 minutes. The supernatants are then removed and stored on ice. Each supernatant (45 ul) is added to 45 ul of reaction buffer (65 mM Tris pH 7.8; 26 mM EDTA, 32.5 mM KF, 9.3 mM UDP-glucose; 11 mg/ml glycogen; 500 nCi/ml 14C-UDP-glucose) and a further 45 ul is added to 45 ul reaction buffer/20 mM glucose-6-phosphate. Reactions are incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes and then spotted onto a 2 cm square 31ET chromatograph paper (Whatman). Filter papers are washed twice for 20 minutes in 66% ethanol, rinsed briefly in acetone and dried for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
Filters are added to 5 ml of liquid scintillant and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The percentage of the total glycogen synthase that is active in any lysate is expressed as 100X (cpm minus glucose-6-phosphate)/(cpm plus glucose-6-phosphate). Such values are determined in duplicate for 5 different concentrations of compound and for DMSO alone, and the values are then plotted against the logarithm of the concentration. The concentration of compound which stimulates glycogen synthase activity to 50% of the maximal level is determined by fitting a sigmoidal curve to the plotted data. The maximal level is defined as that level to which glycogen synthase activity tends asymtotically as the concentration of test compound increases substantially<br>

18 hours following the start of transfection, and the cells are left to grow at 37 °C for another 48 hours.<br>
B.	TAU PHOSPHORYLATION INHIBITION ASSAY<br>
Two hours before harvesting, 2 jil of test compound (GSK3 inhibitor) dissolved in DMSO is added to each well and incubated at 37°C. After 2 hours the medium is removed and the cells are rapidly frozen on the plates on dry ice and stored at -70°C. Cells are thawed on ice in the presence of 200 ul of lysing buffer (1% Triton® X-100, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 15% glycerol, 25 ug/ml leupeptin, 1 \\g ml pepstatin-A, 1 uM PMSF, 21 ug/ml aprotinin, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM p-glycerophosphate, 15 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The contents of each well are centrifuged at 14,000 g, 4°C for 5 minutes and the supernatants transferred to clean tubes. At this point the lysates may be stored at -20°C.<br>
C.	ELISA TO DETECT PHOSPHORYLATED TAU IN CELL LYSATES<br>
Immulon 4 strips (Dynatech) are coated with monoclonal anti-phosphorylated tau<br>
(AT8, Polymedco, Inc.) at 5 fig/ml in PBS containing Ca++ and Mg++, 100 ^I/well. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the strips are washed twice with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween® 20) and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA, 5% normal mouse serum and 0 05% Tween® 20 at room temperature for 1 hour. The strips are washed 5 times with washing buffer. Lysate (100 ul) diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3 is added into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing, 100 ul of 0.5 u-g/ml biotinylated monoclonal anti-(non-phosphorylated) tau (HT7, Polymedco, Inc.) in PBS-BSA is added into each well. Strips are washed 5 times and HRP-conjugated streptavidin is added, incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and washed extensively with washing buffer. TMB substrate (Pierce) is used for color development and the reaction is stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.8 M sulfuric acid. Strips are Tead on an ELISA plate reader using a 450 mn filter. The concentration of compound that inhibits tau phosphorylation to 50% of the maximal level (i.e., IC5o) is determined by fitting a sigmoidal curve to the plotted data.<br>
EXAMPLE 365<br>
TESTING THE POTENTIAL OF GSK3 INHIBITORS TO PROTECT PRIMARY HIPPOCAMPAL CELLS FROM GLUTAMATE EXCITOTOXICITY<br>
Hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 18-19 rats. The tissue was collected in Hibernate TM media (Gibco BRL) and minced into approximately lmm<br>
-85-<br><br>
pieces. Tissue was dissociated using the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Following isolation the cells were resuspended in serum-free media composed of Neurobasal TM (Gibco BRL), 2% B27 supplement (GibcoBRX), L-glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were plated in 35mm tissue culture dishes coated with poly-L-lysine at a concentration of 7.5x104 cells per dish. Following 10-14 days at 37°C in 5% CO2 cells were rinsed and fed with fresh media. The next day representative compounds of the invention were added to the culture media to a final concentration of between lnM and IOO^IM. Four to eight hours following compound addition the conditioned media was removed from cells and stored at 37°C. Cultures were rinsed twice with HEPES-buffered balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing lOuM glycine. Grabb and Choi, J. Newoscience 19:1657-62 (1999). Cultures were then exposed for 5min at room temperature to 200uM glutamic acid in the same HBSS. Following exposure, cultures were rinsed three times with the buffer and then returned to their original conditioned media containing the compounds. Twenty to twenty-four hours following glutamic acid exposure, cultures were rinsed in HBSS and exposed for 10 min to Trypan Blue. This dye is taken up by dead cells. The cultures were rinsed and then fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde . The number of live and dead (blue nuclei) large neurons are counted (at least 200 cells from each culture) by phase contrast microscopy and photographed. Using this method, compounds of this invention have been shown to be capable of significantly reducing the potential of glutamate to induce neuronal cell death.<br>
EXAMPLE 366 EVALUATION OF EFFICACY IN DIABETIC RODENTS<br>
(THE GLUCOSE'TOLERANCE TEST) COMPOUND FORMULATION FOR ORAL DOSING:<br>
Test compounds were typically formulated for oral gavage as solutions in water or suspensions in 1% carboxymethylcellulose/0.1% tween-80 (both from Sigma Chem, MO) the day poor to administration. Some early compounds were formulated as solutions in 15% Captisol (a modified cyclodexytrin by CyDex Co., IL) following procedures common to those below. For water solutions, dry and lyophihzed test compound powder is solubihzed in distilled water and mixed well by vortexmg and sonicating. If necessary, test solution is pH adjusted with 1 N NaOH or 1 N HC1 and is finally sterile filtered through a syringe appended with a 0.2 micron cellulose acetate<br>
-86-<br><br>
membrane (Millipore Co., MA). For oral suspensions, the test compound powder is mixed with a fresh suspension of 1% carboxymethylcellulose/0.1% tween-SO and extensively sonicated, pH adjusted if necessary as described above, and vortexed until particle size is homogeneous and 
Obese db/db (female C57BlKs/J) mice were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME) at 8 weeks of age and used for efficacy testing 1-2 weeks later. On the morning of a test, food was removed early in the morning (7-8hrs prior to the glucose bolus). Local anesthetic (EMLA creme, Astra Pharm., MA) was applied to the end of the tail and 50-100ul blood samples were obtained from snips of the tail tip and collected into eppendorf tubes containing 5ul 500U/mI sodium heparin (Elkins-Sinn, NJ) with subsequent isolation of plasma. Samples were obtained at various intervals throughout the day for a total of 6-8 time points. Mice were randomized into treatment groups and administered the first oral dose of test compound (0.2 ml volume) 4.5 hr prior to the glucose and again 0.5 hr prior to administration of 0.2 ml 50% dextrose (Abbott Lab., IL) via oral gavage (oGTT) or intraperitoneal injection. After the final blood sample about 2 hr following the glucose administration, food was returned to the animals. REGULATION OF BASAL GLYCEMIA AND INSULINEM1A:<br>
Test compounds were typically orally administered to db/db mice (see above) or ZDF rats (Genetic Models, Inc.; Indianapolis, IN) in the context of a multi-day, multi-dose regimen or as a single bolus. The ZpF rats were received at 8 weeks of age and used for efficacy testing 1-2 weeks later. Food was removed about 30min prior to dosing and a single bolus of test compound (dosing volume ranging from 1 - 8 mg/ml) was administered. Blood was sampled as described above at 1-6 time points over the next 2-3 hr. Food was returned to the animal cages following the blood sampling. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS:<br>
Glucose and insulin levels are measured from plasma and/or blood samples. Glucose levels are measured from whole blood by the One-Touch glucometer (Lifescan Co., CA) and from plasma by Beckman glucose analyzer. Glucose results typically reflect blood values for mouse and plasma values for rat studies Measurement of insulin ¦ levels has been via ELISA (Crystal Chem. Co., IL) following the supplier's protocol. "<br>
-87-<br><br>
RESULTS QUANTITATION:<br>
Efficacy may be expressed as mg/dL glucose or ng/ml insulin or represented as area under the curve (AUC) for plasma glucose (taken,above the normoglycemic baseline of 100 mg/dL) and insulin (taken above the normoinsulinemic baseline of 1 ng/mL). Typically, when expressed as AUC, the results are actually represented as reduced AUC ([(vehicle control AUC - test group AUC)/vehicle control AUCX100]). Such expression provides a single quantitative expression of the magnitude of improved glucose disposal and/or reduced basal hyperglycemia or insulin conservation relative to the placebo control group. RESULTS:<br>
Representative compounds of the invention exhibited good in vitro potency, and when formulated in captisol and administered s.c. to mice (30 mg/kg), exhibited high bioavailability and tissue penetrance in viyo. A significant reduction in basal hyperglycemia just prior to the glucose tolerance test, and significantly improved glucose disposal following glucose challenge were observed. A 45-50% reduction in the AUC relative to the control group was observed if the glucose response is quantitated by determining the area under the blood glucose curve (AUC) from -60 min to +120 min. This is comparable to the efficacy obtained with Troglitazone (when dosed orally for at least several days at either 60 or 100 mg/kg/day). Also of significance was the observation that insulin levels in treated animals remained lower than in control mice.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
