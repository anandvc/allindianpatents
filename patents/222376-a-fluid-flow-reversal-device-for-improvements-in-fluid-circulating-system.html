				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the improvements in fluid circulating systems, in particular, although not exclusively to a fluid valve for a textile processing machine.<br>
Yam for textile manufacture is commonly wound on a perforated tubular or fluted bobbin, to form a permeable package through which dye liquor can be circulated during a dyeing process.<br>
During the dyeing process, the permeable packages are mounted on a perforated spindle in a package carrier, which package carrier is submerged in dye liquor during the dyeing process. In practice, eight or rune packages are commonly stacked on each of a plurality of spindles. A sealing disc in then placed on top of each column of packages and locked onto the spindle to render the top of the column water tight.<br>
The package dyeing process involves passing dye or other treatment liquor through the permeable packages, hi order to achieve even colouring throughout the 15 thickness of the yarn package, it is common to pass the dye liquor through the packages hi two opposing directions; namely, inside-out flow and outside-in flow. Inside-out flow means the liquor flows from the 'perforated core of the package, through the yarn, to exterior of the package. Whereas, outside-in flow means the liquor flows from the exterior of the package, through the yarn to the perforated core of the package.<br>
Package dyeing machines generally comprise a pump and a reverse valve hi order to facilitate the reversible flow of treatment liquor. The pump often comprises a centrifugal pump, because such a pump provides the high pressure and high flow rate flow required to overcome the high resistance to the flow of the dye liquor exhibited by the yarn packages. However, a centrifugal pump can generally only operate hi one direction. Therefore, a valve is used to facilitate reversal of the flow direction.<br>
Typical flow reversal valves require an excessive amount of external piping hi order to facilitate the reversal of fluid flow. Such valve designs are disadvantageous<br><br>
because they require a larger amount of treatment liquor to fill the extra piping. Also, die material costs of making the valve are high.<br>

The fluid flow reversal device according to the present invention may be a yam processing machine fluid flow reversal device.<br>
In use of fluid flow reversal device according to the present invention, with a yam processing machine, such as a yam dyeing machine, the fluid flow reversal device is connected to the fluid vessel of the yam processing machine, and to an impeller, provided, for example, by a centrifugal pump.<br>
Fluid is metered into the system and is circulated around by means of the impeller. The direction of flow of the fluid is controlled by the valve in the fluid flow reversal device. Suitably, the suction flow direction of the impeller is substantially parallel to the discharge flow direction thereof.<br>
When the valve is in the first position, the fluid is sucked through the first end of the first arm of the first conduit by means of the impeller. The fluid is discharged from the impeller to flow into heat exchange pipes in a heat exchanger and then into the annular passageway provided between the exterior of the first arm of the first conduit and the interior of the second conduit The fluid flows along the passage to a chamber provided between the second end of the first arm of the first conduit and the wall of the housing. In the chamber between the second end of the first conduit and the<br><br>
housing wall, the fluid turns and enters the second end of the first arm of the first conduit<br>
With the valve in the first position, the fluid is directed into the first pipe section of the second arm of the first conduit. The fluid flows up through the first pipe section and out of the housing into a package carrier of the yarn processing machine to which the fluid flow reversal device is connected.<br>
The fluid then flows through the perforated cores of the yarn packages housed hi the package carrier and out through the yam. The fluid then flows into a collection vessel surrounding the package carrier.<br>

With the valve in the second position, fluid is again sucked from the first arm of the first conduit by means of the impeller and discharged from the impeller into heat exchange pipes in a heat exchanger and then into the annular passage provided between the first conduit and the second conduit. The fluid flows along the passage into the chamber between the second end of the first arm of the first conduit and the housing wall. In this chamber the fluid turns and enters the second end of the first arm of the first conduit.<br>
The valve then deflects the fluid into the second pipe section of the second arm of the first conduit and out into the ulterior of the housing. The fluid flows through the housing to exits therefrom through the perforations in the first end thereof.<br>
The fluid flows from the perforations into the fluid collection vessel of the yarn processing machine and into the packages through the yam towards the perforated core. On passing through the perforated core of the packages, the fluid flows into the package carrier and back into the first conduit via the first pipe section of the second<br><br>
arm thereof. The impeller sucks the fluid back along the first arm of the first conduit for re-circulation.<br>
A fluid flow reversal device in accordance with the present invention advantageously comprises a reduced amount of external piping between the centrifugal pump and the valve, which reduces cost of manufacture and the amount of treatment fluid required.<br>
Moreover, in embodiments of the present invention, the rotatable closure member of the valve may be the only moving part within the fluid flow reversal device thereby reducing the maintenance requirements of the device.<br>
Furthermore, a fluid flow reversal device in accordance with the present invention advantageously comprises a heat exchanger connected between the centrifugal pump and the annular passage to heat up or cool down the fluid, for example the dye liquor. The present of the heat exchanger can improve the liquor ratio.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, only the axle for supporting the rotatable closure member of the valve pierces the housing. Therefore, less material is required for reinforcement of the high pressure vessel around the openings in the walls thereof,<br>
The annular flow discharge arrangement of the fluid flow reversal device creates reduced flow resistance therefore requiring less power to drive the fluid flow.<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the following drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic, cross-sectional side view of a fluid flow reversal device arranged for use;<br>
Figure 2a shows the apparatus of figure 1 in use with a package carrier of a yam treatment machine, with the valve located in the first position, and Figure 2b shows the apparatus of figure 1 in use with a package carrier of a yam treatment machine, with the valve located in the second position.<br><br>
Figures 1,2a and 2b show a fluid flow reversal device 100 comprising a cross pipe 1, a rotatable closure member 2, mounted on an axle 3, an outer pipe 6 and a housing 7.<br>
The cross pipe 1 comprises a first pipe 30, and first and second pipe sections 32, 34 extending substantially perpendicular from the first pipe 30. The first and second pipe sections 32,34 extend from opposite sides of the first pipe 30 and are axially aligned. A first opening 36 and its second opening 38 in the side wall of the first pipe 30 ensures that the first pipe section 32 and the second pipe section 34, respectively is in fluid flow communication with the first pipe 30. The cross pipe 1 has four ports 11, 12,16 and 17.<br>
Port 16 of the first pipe 30 extends into the interior of the outer pipe 6, such that the cross pipe 1 is in fluid flow communication with the outer pipe 6 via the port 16.<br>
Port 12 of the cross pipe 1 is connected to the fluid inlet of a centrifugal pump 5. The centrifugal pump 5 houses an impeller 4. The centrifugal pump 5 is driven by an external motor 10.<br>
The outer pipe 6 has an ulterior diameter mat is greater man the exterior diameter of the first pipe 30. The outer pipe 6 is arranged concentrically with the first pipe 30 of the cross pipe 1. A first end 46 of the outer pipe 6 is connected to one end of heat exchange pipes 51 in a heat exchanger 50. The other end of the heat exchanger pipes 51 is connected to the fluid outlet of the centrifugal pump 5. A second end 48 of the outer pipe 6 is welded to the housing 7. The wall of the housing 7 has a curved profile 23 in the region at which the outer pipe 6 is welded thereto.<br>
The distal ends of the first pipe section 32 and the second pipe section 34 each extend through opposing sides of the outer pipe 6.<br>
The housing 7 has a generally cylindrical shape. One end of the housing 7 is closed and provides a base 44. The other end of the housing 7 is provided with a plurality of perforations 18 to allow fluid flow between the exterior and the interior of the housing 7, when in use. The first pipe section 32 of the cross pipe 1 extends through the full height of the housing 7 to the pierce the perforated end of the housing 7, thus allowing<br>
for fluid flow between the interior of the first pipe section 32 and the exterior of the housing?.<br>
The axle 3 of the closure member 2 is controlled by a motor (not shown), which motor is located externally of the housing. The closure member 2 can rotate between first position (shown in Figure 1) and a second position (as illustrated in dashed lines in Figure 1).<br>
Figure 2a and 2b illustrates the fluid flow reversal device 100 in use connected to a dyeing vessel 19 of a yarn dyeing machine (not shown). The arrows indicate the direction of flow of the fluid.<br>
When the closure member 2 is in the first position, as illustrated in figure 2a, fluid flows from the inside to the outside of the yarn packages 22 in the dye vessel 19. The centrifugal pump 5 creates a suction force to draw fluid through the first pipe 30 of the cross-pipe 1 and through port 12. The fluid is discharged from the centrifugal pump 5 through the heat exchange pipes 51 in the heat exchanger 50 and then into the annular passage 14 provided between the first pipe 30 and the outer pipe 6. As can be seen from the figures 2a and 2b, the suction flow direction is substantially parallel to the discharge flow direction.<br>
The fluid enters the turning chamber 15 provided between the housing, wall and the port 16 of the first pipe 30. The curved shape 23 of the housing wall at this location smooths the flow of fluid from the annular passage 14 into the port 16.<br>
The fluid is deflected by the closure member 2 to flow upwards through port 17 of the cross pipe 1 and out of the housing 7 into the package carrier 20 of the yam dyeing machine. The fluid flows into the perforated core 21 of each package 22, our through die yarn wound on the core 22 and into the dyeing vessel 19.<br>
The fluid then passes through the perforations 18 in the housing 7 to flow towards the base 44 of the housing 7 and up into the cross pipe 1 via port 11, to return to port 12 thereof.<br>
When the closure member 2 in the second position, as illustrated in figure 2b, fluid flows from the outside to the inside of the yarn packages 22. The centrifugal pump 5 sucks fluid from the cross pipe 1 via port 12 and then discharges the fluid into the annular passage 14.<br>
The fluid then enters the turning chamber 15 and enters the cross pipe 1 via port 16. The closure member 2 deflects the fluid to exit the cross pipe 1 via port 11. The fluid thus passes from the cross pipe 1 into the ulterior of the housing 7.<br>
The fluid flows upwards through the housing to exit therefrom via perforations 18 into the dye vessel 19. The fluid then passes through the yam on the packages 22 into the perforated cores 21 thereof. The fluid passes therefrom into the package carrier 20 and back into the cross pipe 1 via port 17 to return to the centrifugal pump 5 via port 12.<br><br><br><br>
