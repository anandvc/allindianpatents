Detereent Composition Preparation<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in liquid, paste or granular form Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means The forgoing description of uses for the dye maintenance polymers defined herein are intended to be exemplary and other uses will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention<br>
Granular compositions, for example, are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g , surfactants, builders, water, etc , as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%) The remaining dry ingredients, e g , granules of the essential dye maintenance polymers, can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules m a rotary mixing drum The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the essential dye maintenance polymers, enzymes, binders and perfumes, can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/1. In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents Addition of the dye maintenance polymers to liquid detergent or other aqueous compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid solutions the desired dye maintenance polymers.<br>
Fabric Laundering Method<br>
The present invention also provides a method for laundering fabrics in a manner which imparts fabric appearance benefits provided by the dye maintenance polymers used herein Such a method employs contacting these fabrics with an aqueous washing solution formed from an effective amount of the detergent compositions hereinbefore described or formed from the<br>
individual components of such compositions    Contacting of fabrics with washing solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation although the compositions of the present invention may also be used to form aqueous unagitated soaking solutions for fabric cleaning and treatment As discussed above, it is preferred that the washing solution have a pH of less than about 10 0, preferably it has a pH of about 9 5 and most preferably it has a pH of about 7 5<br>
Agitation is preferably provided in a washing machine for good 'cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabric in a conventional clothes dryer.

Fabric Conditioning and Softening<br>
The dye maintenance polymers hereinbefore described as components of the laundry detergent compositions herein may also be used to treat and condition fabrics and textiles in the absence of the detersive surfactant and builder components of the detergent composition embodiments of this invention. Thus, for example, a fabric conditioning composition comprising a fabric softener and the dye maintenance polymer or a fabric treatment composition comprising only the dye maintenance polymers themselves, or comprising an aqueous solution of the dye maintenance polymers, may be added during the nnse cycle of a conventional home laundering operation in order to impart the desired fabric appearance and integrity benefits hereinbefore described.<br>
The fabric softener compositions of the present invention comprise at least about 1%, preferably from about 8%, more preferably from about 20% to about 80%, more preferably to about 60%, most preferably to about 45% by weight, of the composition of one or more fabric softener actives.<br>
The preferred fabric softening actives according to the present invention are amines having the formula.<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
quaternary ammonium compounds having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein each R is independently C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl, and mixtures thereof; R1 is preferably C11-C22 linear alkyl, C11-C22 branched alkyl, C11-C22 linear alkenyl, C11-C22 branched alkenyl, and mixtures thereof, Q is a carbonyl moiety independently selected from the units having the formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R.2 IS hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, preferably hydrogen; R3 is C1-C4 alkyl, preferably hydrogen or methyl; preferably Q has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
X is a softener compatible anion, preferably the anion of a strong acid, for example, chloride, bromide, methylsulfate, ethylsulfate, sulfate, nitrate and mixtures thereof, more preferably chloride and methyl sulfate. The anion can also, but less preferably, carry a double charge, in which case        represents half a group. The index m has a value of from 1 to 3, die index n has a value of from 1 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, more preferably 2<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides for amines and quatemized amines having two or more different values for the index n per molecule, for example, a softener active prepared from the starting amine methyl(3-aminopropyl)(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
More preferred softener actives according to the present invention have the formula<br>
wherein the unit having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
is a fatty acyl moiety. Suitable fatty acyl moieties for use in the softener actives of the present invention are derived from sources of triglycerides including tallow, vegetable oils and/or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils including inter aha canola oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, com oil, soybean oil, tall oil, rice bran oil. Yet more preferred are the Diester Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (DEQA's) wherein the index m is equal to 2<br>
The formulator, depending upon the desired physical and performance properties of the final fabric softener active, can choose any of the above mentioned sources of fatty acyl moieties, or alternatively, the formulator can mix sources of triglyceride to form a "customized blend" However, those skilled in the art of fats and oils recognize that the fatty acyl composition may vary, as in the case of vegetable oil, from crop to crop, or from variety of vegetable oil source to variety of vegetable oil source. DEQA's which are prepared using fatty acids derived from natural sources are preferred.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides softener actives comprising R' units which have at least about 3%, preferably at least about 5%, more preferably at least about 10%, most preferably at least about 15% C11-C22 alkenyl, including polyalkenyl (polyunsaturated) units inter alia oleic, hnoleic, linolemc.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "mixed chain fatty acyl units" is defined as "a mixture of fatty acyl units comprising alkyl and alkenyl chains having from 10 carbons to 22 carbon atoms including the carbonyl carbon atom, and in the case of alkenyl chains, from one to three double bonds, preferably all double bonds in the cis configuration". With regard to the R.I units of the present invention, it is preferred that at least a substantial percentage of the fatty acyl groups are unsaturated, e.g., from about 25%, preferably from about 50% to about 70%, preferably to about 65%. The total level of fabric softening active containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups can be from about 3%, preferably from about 5%, more preferably from about 10% to about 30%, preferably to about 25%, more preferably to about 18%. As stated herein above cis and trans isomers can be used, preferably with a as/trans ratio is of from l-i, prefeiably at least 3:1, and more preferably from about 4:1 to about 501, more preferably about 20 1, however, the minimum being 1 1<br>
The level of unsaturation contained within the tallow, canola, or other fatty acyl unit chain can be measured by the Iodine Value (IV) of the corresponding fatty acid, which in the present case should preferably be in the range of from 5 to 100 with two categories of compounds being distinguished, having a IV below or above 25<br>
Indeed, for compounds having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
derived from tallow fatty acids, when the Iodine Value is from 5 to 25, preferably 15 to 20, it has been found that a cis/trans isomer weight ratio greater than about 30/70, preferably greater than about 50/50 and more preferably greater than about 70/30 provides optimal concentrabihty<br>
For compounds of this type made from tallow fatty acids having a Iodine Value of above 25, the ratio of cis to trans isomers has been found to be less critical unless very high concentrations are needed   A further preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises DEQA's wherein the average Iodine Value for R1 is approximately 45.<br>
The R.1 units suitable for use in the isotropic liquids present invention can be further characterized in that the Iodine Value (IV) of the parent fatty acid, said IV is preferably from about 10, more preferably from about 50, most preferably from about 70, to a value of about 140, preferably to about 130, more preferably to about 115. However, formulators, depending upon which embodiment of the present invention they choose to execute, may wish to add an amount of fatty acyl units which have Iodine Values outside the range listed herein above. For example, "hardened stock" (IV less than or equal to about 10) may be combined with the source of fatty acid admixture to adjust the properties of the final softener active.<br>
A prefered source of fatty acyl units, especially fatty acyl units having branching, for example, "Guerbet branching", methyl, ethyl, etc. units substituted along the primary alkyl chain, synthetic sources of fatty acyl units are also suitable. For example, the formulator may with to add one or more fatty acyl units having a methyl branch at a "non-naturally occunng" position, for example, at the third carbon of a C17 chain   What is meant herein by the term "non-naturally occunng" is "acyl units whihc are not found m significant (greater than about 0.1%) quantities is common fats and oils which serve as feedstocks for the source of triglycerides described herein " If the desired branched chain fatty acyl unit is unavailable from readily available natural feedstocks, therefore, synthetic fatty acid can be suitably admixed with othei synthetic materials or with other natural triglyceride derived sources of acyl units<br>
The following are examples of preferred softener actives according to the present invention.<br>

EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate the compositions and methods of the present invention, but are not necessarily meant to limit or otherwise define the scope of the invention<br>
EXAMPLE I Dye Maintenance Parameter 1 est To evaluate a dye maintenance polymer, prepare a 10 ppm solution of the dye maintenance polymer in water   Add 800ml of this solution to a l000mL beaker Introduce 8 gm+/-50mg of CI 10 fabric (CI 10 is a poplin fabric dyed with Direct Black 112 and supplied by Empirical Manufacturing Company of Cincinnati, OH) swatch in the solution such that it is completely immersed m the liquid   Agitate the solution gently with a magnetic stirrer for 120 minutes   A portion of the dye from the fabric will slowly bleed into the water   After 120 minutes, withdraw an aliquot of the liquor, place it in a 5 cm path length cell and measure its absorbance at wavelength of 600nm with a Hewlett Packard Model 8453 uv-vis spectrophotomer following the general instructions provided by the manufacturer for the use of this instrument This absorbance is called AbsPolymer.<br>
Using the procedure outlined above, repeat the procedure with distilled water alone with no added dye maintenance polymer to obtain AbsWtler<br>
The Dye Maintenance Parameter ("DMP") is defined as (AbSw„„ - AbsPolymtr)<br>
EXAMPLE II Calculation of the Average Charge Per Molecule<br>
While there are many ways to calculate the charge density of a polymeric matenal known to those skilled m the analytical arts, one such method is as follows. Specifically, the charge density for molecules with a known chemical structure, is determined by a standard acid-base titration or a potentiometnc titration to give charge to mass ratio Charge density can then be converted to an average charge per molecule by determining the average molecular weight of the matenal and simply dividing the charge density by the average molecular weight to determine the average number of positive charges per molecule<br>
For low molecular weight matenals, molecular weight is determined standard techniques such as mass spectrosocpy   For polymenc matenals, molecular weight is determined by gel permeation chromatography. These methods are descnbed in analytical text books such as "Instrumental Methods of Analysis" by Willard, Memtt, Dean, and Settle<br>
