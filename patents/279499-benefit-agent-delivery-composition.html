DELIVERY PARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present application relates to agglomerates/particles comprising encapsulated benefit agents, compositions comprising such agglomerates/particles, and processes for making and using such agglomerates/particles and compositions comprising such agglomerates/particles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benefit agents, such as perfumes, silicones, waxes, flavors, vitamins and fabric softening agents, are expensive and generally less effective when employed at high levels in personal care compositions, cleaning compositions, and fabric care compositions. As a result, there is a desire to maximize the effectiveness of such benefit agents. One method of achieving this objective is to improve the delivery efficiencies of such benefit agents. Unfortunately, it is difficult to improve the delivery efficiencies of benefit agents as such agents may be lost do to die agents' physical or chemical characteristics, or such agents may be incompatible with other compositional components or the situs diat is treated.<br>
In an effort to improve the delivery efficiencies of benefit agents, the industry, in many cases, encapsulates such benefit agents. Unfortunately, in some cases, benefit agents, for example, perfume raw materials and flavors, may degrade over time. This results in decreased efficacy and/or the need for additional amounts of such materials to compensate for the loss.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a process and a benefit delivery agent that minimizes or eliminates one or more problems associated widi the use of encapsulates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present application relates to benefit agent delivery compositions comprising a material selected from the group consisting of: an agglomerate, particulate and/or extrudate comprising chelant and an encapsulated benefit agent having a core and a shell encapsulating said core; an agglomerate, particulate and/or extrudate comprising chelant and an encapsulated benefit agent having a core and a shell encapsulating said core, such encapsulated benefit agent<br>

Benefit Agent Delivery Composition - Agglomerate/Particle/Extrudate<br>
Applicants have recognized that particular materials used as benefit agents—in particularly those materials that comprise aldehyde moieties, for example, certain perfumes and flavors —^when encapsulated, degrade at unexpectedly higher rates. Without being bound by theory. Applicants believe that such material degradation may be the result of oxidation by oxygen in the presence of catalytic materials. For example. Applicants believe that perfume raw material degradation may be the result of oxidation by oxygen in the presence of metal catalysts such as Fe. Specifically, Applicants believe that Fe203—which can be a common impurity in silica used to prepare encapsulates such as those described herein—may result in Fe catalysis of the oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid by oxygen, resulting in the degradation of encapsulated aldehyde-containing materials. Applicants have recognized that, by addition of a chelant, such degradation may be significantly reduced.<br>

Process of Making Encapsulated Benefit Agents<br>
The encapsulated benefit agents employed herein may be made via the teachings of USPN 6,592,990 B2 and/or 6,544,926 Bl and the examples disclosed herein.<br>
Anionic emulsifiers are typically used during the encapsulation process to emulsify the benefit agent prior to microcapsule formation. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the anionic materials adversely interact with the cationic surfactant actives that are often found in compositions such as fabric care compositions - this may yield an aesthetically unpleasing aggregation of particles that are employed in said composition. In addition to the unacceptable aesthetics, such aggregates may result in rapid phase separation of the particles from the bulk phase. Applicants discovered that such aggregates can be prevented by the addition of certain aggregate inhibiting materials including materials selected from the group consisting of salts, polymers and mixtures thereof. Useful aggregate inhibiting materials include, divalent salts such as magnesium salts, for example, magnesium chloride, magnesium acetate, magnesium phosphate, magnesium formate, magnesium boride, magnesium titanate, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate; calcium salts, for example, calcium chloride, calcium formate, calcium acetate, calcium bromide; trivalent salts, such as aluminum salts, for example, aluminum sulfate, aluminum phosphate, aluminum chloride n-hydrate and polymers that have the ability to suspend anionic particles such as soil suspension polymers, for example, (polyethylene imines, aUcoxylated polyethylene imines, polyquatemium-6 and polyquatemium-7.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, encapsulated benefit agents are manufactured and are subsequently coated with a material to reduce the rate of leakage of the benefit agent fi-om the particles when the particles are subjected to a bulk environment containing, for example, surfactants, polymers, and solvents. Non-limiting examples of coating materials that can serve as barrier materials include materials selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone<br>

Method of Use<br>
Compositions containing the encapsulated benefit agent disclosed herein can be used to clean or treat a situs inter alia a stuface or fabric. Typically at least a portion of the situs is contacted with an embodiment of Applicants' composition, in neat form or diluted in a liquor, for example, a wash liquor and then the situs may be optionally washed and/or rinsed. In one aspect, a situs may be optionally washed and/or rinsed, contacted with a one or more of the benefit agent delivery compositions of the present invention or a consumer product comprising one or more of the benefit agent delivery compositions of the present invention and then optionally washed and/or rinsed. For purposes of the present invention, washing includes but is not limited to, scrubbing, and mechanical agitation. The fabric may comprise most any fabric capable of being laundered or treated in normal consumer use conditions. Liquors that may comprise the disclosed compositions may have a pH of from about 3 to about 11.5. Such compositions are typically employed at concentrations of from about 500 ppm to about 15,000 ppm in solution. When the wash solvent is water, the water temperature typically ranges from about 5 °C to about 90 °C and, when the situs comprises a fabric, the water to fabric ratio is typically from about 1:1 to about 30:1.<br>
TEST METHODS<br>
It is understood that the test methods that are disclosed in the Test Methods Section of the present application should be used to determine the respective values of the parameters of Applicants' invention as such invention is described and claimed herein.<br>
Method to Determine the Characteristic Dimension (Agglomerates and Particulates)<br>
The particle size distribution of the benefit agent delivery composition is determined using the ASTM test method E726-01 "Particle Size Distribution of Granular Carriers and Granular<br>
 <br>
39<br>
Pesticides". Specifically the method should be carried out using a Tyler RoTap sieve shaker supplied with cast iron sieve stack lid with centrally mounted cork (W.S. Tyler Company, Cleveland, Ohio). At least 5 sieve sizes should be selected to cover the full particle size range of the material being analysed (step 7.1). If after sieving, more than 40wt% of the sample is found on a single sieve then the sieve selection should be modified and the sample retested until 
The following parameters for operation of the RoTap should be applied to step 7.4 of the method:<br>
1)	152 taps/minute<br>
2)	285 ipm elliptical motion<br>
3)	Cork on lid to protrude 5 mm from top of holding cup.<br>
4)	A hammer drop of 33 mm from the peak height of the hammer to the top of the cork.<br>
5)	Sieve time 5 minutes.<br>
The data are plotted on a semi-log plot with the micron size opening of each sieve plotted against the logarithmic abscissa and the cumulative mass percent (Q3) plotted against the linear ordinate. An example of the above data representation is given in ISO 9276-1:1998, "Representation of results of particle size analysis - Part 1: Graphical Representation", Figure A.4. The seed material median particle size (D50), for the purpose of this invention, is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative mass percent is equal to 50 percent, and is calculated by a straight line interpolation between the data points directly above (a50) and below (bSO) the 50% value using the following equation:<br>
D50 = 10'^[Log(Da50) - (Log(Da50) - Log(Db50))*(Qa50 - 50%)/(Qa50 - Qb50)] where Qa50 and Qb50 are the cumulative mass percentile values of the data inmiediately above and below the 50th percentile, respectively; and Da50 and Db50 are the micron sieve size values corresponding to these data. The median particle size on a mass basis is considered, for purposes of the present application, to be the characteristic dimension.<br>
Method to Determine the Characteristic Dimension (Extrudates)<br>
The diameter of an extrudate is obtained by measurement using a micrometer while the material is at 20°C.  In order to determine the mean, five representative extrudates are taken from the<br>
 <br>
40<br>
sample to be tested and are measured taking care to not defonn the extrudates during the measuring process and the arithmetic mean of such measurements is then calculated. Such arithmetic mean is considered, for purposes of the present appUcation, to be the characteristic dimension of the extrudates.<br>

It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Melamine based Polyurea capsule (80% Core/20wt% Wall)<br>
A first mixture is prepared by combining 208 grams of water and 5 grams of alkyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer (Polysciences, Inc. of Warrington, Pennsylvania, USA). This first mixture is adjusted to pH 5.0 using acetic acid. 125 grams of the capsule core material comprising a fragrance oil is added to the first mixture at a temperature of 45 °C to form an emulsion. The capsule wall is formed as follows: 9 grams of a corresponding capsule wall material copolymer pre-polymer (butylacrylate-acrylic acid copolymer) and 90 grams of water are combined and adjusted to pH 5.0. 28 grams of a partially methylated methylol melamine resin solution ("Cymel 385", 80% solids, Cytec) is added. This mixture is added to the above described firagrance oil-in-water emulsion with stirring at a temperature of 45 °C. High speed blending is used to achieve a volume-mean particle size of 15 micron. The tempo-ature of the mixture is gradually raised to 65 °C, and is maintained at this temperature overnight with continuous stirring to initiate and complete encapsulation. To form the acrylic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymer capsule wall, the alkyl group can be selected from ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, or other alkyl groups having from one to about sixteen carbons, preferably one to eight carbons.<br>
