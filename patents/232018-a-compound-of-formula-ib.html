Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionised, partially ionised, or non-ionised. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).<br>
Although the stereochemistry on the pyrrolidine ring of formula (I) is fixed, certain of the compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.<br>
Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
Stereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art - see, for example, "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds" by E L Eliel (Wiley, New York, 1994).<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion into compounds of the invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36CI, respectively.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred in view of their ease of preparation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopicaiiy-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are amino acids. Since amino acids are amphoteric, pharmacologically compatible salts can be salts of appropriate non-toxic inorganic or organic acids or bases. Suitable acid addition salts are the hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, fumarate, aspartate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, camsylate, D and L-lactate, D and L-tartrate, edisylate, mesylate, malonate, orotate, gluceptate, methylsulphate, stearate, glucuronate, 2-napsylate, tosylate, hibenzate, nicotinate, isethionate, malate, maleate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, esylate, trifluoroacetate and pamoate salts.<br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the sodium, potassium, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, choline, diolamine, olamine, arginine, glycine, tromethamine, benzathine, lysine, meglumine and diethylamine salts. The,,compounds of the invention may also be formed as a zwitterion.<br>
A suitable salt for amino acid compounds of the present invention is the hydrochloride salt. For a review on suitable salts see Stahl and Wermuth, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany (2002).<br>
Salts with quaternary ammonium ions can also be prepared with, for example, the tetramethyl-ammonium ion. Research has shown that the oral absorption of certain drugs may be increased by the preparation of "soft" quaternary salts. The quaternary salt is termed a "soft" quaternary salt since, unlike normal quaternary salts, e.g.,<br>
R-N+(CH3)3, it can release the active drug on hydrolysis. "Soft" quaternary salts have<br>
useful physical properties compared with the basic drug or its salts. Water solubility may be increased compared with other salts, such as the hydrochloride, but more important there may be an increased absorption of the drug from the intestine. Increased absorption is probably due to the fact that the "soft" quaternary salt has surfactant properties and is capable of forming micelles and unionized ion pairs with bile acids, etc., which are able to penetrate the intestinal epithelium more effectively. The pro-drug, after absorption, is rapidly hydrolyzed with release of the active parent drug.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) may be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the compound of formula (I) and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include references to salts, solvates and complexes thereof and to solvates and complexes of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, polymorphs, pro-drugs, and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).<br>
As stated, the invention includes all polymorphs of the compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are so-called 'pro-drugs' of the compounds of formula (I). Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when* administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative metabolism. Such derivatives are referred to as 'pro-drugs'. Further information on the use of pro-drugs may be found in 'Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design', Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Pro-drugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described in "Design of ester pro-drugs to enhance oral absorption of poorly permeable compounds" by K. Beaumont et al, Current Drug Metabolism, 2003 and "Design of Pro-drugs" by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier) 1985. Further, certain compounds of the invention may act as pro-drugs of other compounds of the invention. All protected derivatives, and pro-drugs, of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.<br>
Some examples of pro-drugs in accordance with the invention include:<br>
(i) an ester of the carboxylic acid functionality (-COOH) of the compound of formula (I), for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C6)alkyl, or a carboxamide thereof, for example, replacement of the hydroxyl with an amino functionality (-NH2 , -NHR or NRR' where R and R' are each independently (Cr C6)alkyl):<br>
(ii) an amide of the secondary amino functionality (NHR where R ^ H) of the compound of formula (I), for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C6) alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other pro-drug types may be found in the aforementioned references, which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Aminoacyl-glycolic and -lactic esters are known as pro-drugs of amino acids (Wermuth C.G., Chemistry and Industry, 1980:433-435). The carbonyl group of the amino acids can be esterified by known means. Pro-drugs and soft drugs are known in the art (Palomino E., Drugs of the Future, 1990;15(4):361-368).<br>
The invention also relates to therapeutic use of the present compounds as agents for treating or relieving the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. Such neurodegenerative disorders include, for example, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The present invention also covers treating neurodegenerative disorders termed acute brain injury. These include but are not limited to: stroke, head trauma, and asphyxia. Stroke refers to a cerebral vascular disease and may also be referred to as a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and includes acute thromboembolic stroke. Stroke includes both focal and global ischemia. Also, included are transient cerebral ischemic attacks and other cerebral vascular problems accompanied by cerebral ischemia. These vascular disorders may occur in a patient undergoing carotid endarterectomy specifically or other cerebrovascular or vascular surgical procedures in general, or diagnostic vascular procedures including cerebral angiography and the like. Other incidents are head trauma, spinal cord traurna, or injury from general anoxia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypotension as well as similar injuries seen during procedures from embole, hyperfusion, and hypoxia. The instant invention would be useful in a range of incidents, for example, during cardiac bypass surgery, in incidents of intracranial hemorrhage, in perinatal asphyxia, in cardiac arrest, and status epilepticus.<br>
A skilled physician will be able to determine the appropriate situation in which subjects are susceptible to or at risk of, for example, stroke as well as suffering from stroke for administration by methods of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful for the general treatment of pain, particularly neuropathic pain. Physiological pain is an important protective mechanism designed to warn of danger from potentially injurious stimuli from the external environment. The system operates through a specific set of primary sensory neurones and is exclusively activated by noxious stimuli via peripheral transducing mechanisms (Millan 1999 Prog. Neurobio. 57: 1-164 for an integrative Review). These sensory fibres are known as nociceptors and are characterised by small diameter axons with slow conduction velocities. Nociceptors encode the intensity, duration and quality of noxious stimulus and by virtue of their topographically organised projection to the spinal cord, the location of the stimulus. The nociceptors are found on nociceptive nerve fibres of which there are two main types, A-delta fibres (myelinated) and C fibres (non-myelinated). The activity generated by nociceptor input is transferred after complex processing in the dorsal horn, either directly or via brain stem relay nuclei to the ventrobasal thalamus and then on to the cortex, where the sensation of pain is generated.<br>
Intense acute pain and chronic pain may involve the same pathways driven by pathophysiological processes and as such cease to provide a protective mechanism and instead contribute to debilitating symptoms associated with a wide range of disease states. Pain is a feature of many trauma and disease states. When a substantial injury, via disease or trauma, to body tissue occurs the characteristips of nociceptor activation are altered. There is sensitisation in the periphery, locally around the injury and centrally where the nociceptors terminate. This leads to hypersensitivity at the site of damage and in nearby normal tissue. In acute pain these mechanisms can be useful and allow for the repair processes to take place and the hypersensitivity returns to normal once the injury has healed. However, in many chronic pain states, the hypersensitivity far outlasts the healing process and is normally due to nervous system injury. This injury often leads to maladaptation of the afferent fibres (Woolf &amp; Salter 2000 Science 288: 1765-1768). Clinical pain is present when discomfort and abnormal sensitivity feature among the patient's symptoms. Patients tend to be quite<br>
heterogeneous and may present with various pain symptoms. There are a number of typical pain subtypes: 1) spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning, or stabbing; 2) pain responses to noxious stimuli are exaggerated (hyperalgesia); 3) pain is produced by normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia) (Meyer et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 13-44). Although patients with back pain, arthritis pain, CNS trauma, or neuropathic pain may have similar symptoms, the underlying mechanisms are different and, therefore, may require different treatment strategies. Therefore pain can be divided into a number of different areas because of differing pathophysiology, these include nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic pain etc. It should be noted that some types of pain have multiple aetiologies and thus can be classified in more than one area, e.g. Back pain, Cancer pain have both nociceptive and neuropathic components.<br>
Nociceptive pain is induced by tissue injury or by intense stimuli with the potential to cause injury. Pain afferents are activated by transduction of stimuli by nociceptors at the site of injury and sensitise the spinal cord at the level of their termination. This is then relayed up the spinal tracts to the brain where pain is perceived (Meyer et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 13-44). The activation of nociceptors activates two types of afferent nerve fibres. Myelinated A-delta fibres transmitted rapidly and are responsible for the sharp and stabbing pain sensations, whilst unmyelinated C fibres transmit at a slower rate and convey the dull or aching pain. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of, but is not limited to pain from strains/sprains, post-operative pain (pain following any type of surgical procedure), posttraumatic pain, burns, myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, and renal colic. Also cancer related acute pain syndromes commonly due to therapeutic interactions such as chemotherapy toxicity, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiotherapy. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of, but is not limited to, cancer pain which may be tumour related pain, (e.g. bone pain, headache and facial pain, visceral pain) or associated with cancer therapy (e.g. postchemotherapy syndromes, chronic postsurgical pain syndromes, post radiation syndromes), back pain which may be due to herniated or ruptured intervertabral discs or abnormalities of the lumber facet joints, sacroiliac joints, paraspinal muscles or the posterior longitudinal ligament<br>
Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system (IASP definition). Nerve damage can be caused by trauma and disease and thus the term 'neuropathic pain' encompasses many disorders with diverse aetiologies. These include but are not limited to, Diabetic neuropathy, Post herpetic neuralgia, Back pain, Cancer neuropathy, HIV neuropathy, Phantom limb pain, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, chronic alcoholism, hypothyroidism, trigeminal neuralgia, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Neuropathic pain is pathological as it has no protective role. It is often present well after the original cause has dissipated, commonly lasting for years, significantly decreasing a patients quality of life (Woolf and Mannion 1999 Lancet 353: 1959-1964). The symptoms of neuropathic pain are difficult to treat, as they are often heterogeneous even between patients with the same disease (Woolf &amp; Decosterd 1999 Pain Supp. 6: S141-S147; Woolf and Mannion 1999 Lancet 353: 1959-1964). They include spontaneous pain, which can be continuous, or paroxysmal and abnormal evoked pain, such as hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to a noxious stimulus) and allodynia (sensitivity to a normally innocuous stimulus).<br>
The inflammatory process is a complex series of biochemical and cellular events activated in response to tissue injury or the presence of foreign substances, which result in swelling and pain (Levine and Taiwo 1994: Textbook of Pain 45-56). Arthritic pain makes up the majority of the inflammatory pain population. Rheumatoid disease is one of the commonest chronic inflammatory conditions in developed countries and rheumatoid arthritis is a common cause of disability. The exact aetiology of RA is unknown, but current hypotheses suggest that both genetic and microbiological factors may be important (Grennan &amp; Jayson 1994 Textbook of Pain 397-407). It has been estimated that almost 16 million Americans have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease, most of whom are over 60 years of age, and this is expected to increase to 40 million as the age of the population increases, making this a public health problem of enormous magnitude (Houge &amp; Mersfelder 2002 Ann Pharmacother. 36: 679-686; McCarthy et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 387-395). Most patients with OA seek medical attention because of pain. Arthritis has a significant impact on<br>
psychosocial and physical function and is known to be the leading cause of disability in later life. Other types of inflammatory pain include but are not limited to inflammatory bowehdiseases (IBD),<br>
Other types of pain include but are not limited to;<br>
-	Musculo-skeletal disorders including but not limited to myalgia, fibromyalgia,<br>
spondylitis, sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism,<br>
dystrophinopathy, Glycogenolysis, polymyositis, pyomyositis.<br>
Central pain or 'thalamic pain' as defined by pain caused by lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system including but not limited to central post-stroke pain, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.<br>
-	Heart and vascular pain including  but not limited to angina,  myocardial<br>
infarction, mitral stenosis, pericarditis, Raynaud's phenomenon, scleredoma, skeletal<br>
muscle ischemia.<br>
-	Visceral pain, and gastrointestinal disorders. The viscera encompasses the<br>
organs of the abdominal cavity. These organs include the sex organs, spleen and part<br>
of the digestive system.  Pain associated with the viscera can be divided into digestive<br>
visceral pain and non-digestive visceral pain. Commonly encountered gastrointestinal<br>
(Gl) disorders include the functional bowel disorders (FBD) and the inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases (IBD). These Gl disorders include a wide range of disease states that are<br>
currently only moderately controlled, including - for FBD, gastro-esophageal reflux,<br>
dyspepsia, the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain syndrome<br>
(FAPS), and - for IBD, Crohn's disease, ileitis, and ulcerative colitis, which all regularly<br>
produce visceral pain. Other types of visceral pain include the pain associated with<br>
dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, cystitis and pancreatitis.<br>
-	Head pain including but not limited to migraine, migraine with aura, migraine<br>
without aura cluster headache, tension-type headache.<br>
-	Orofacial pain including but not limited to dental pain, temporomandibular<br>
myofascial pain.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of depression. Depression can be the result of organic disease, secondary to stress associated with personal loss, or idiopathic in origin. There is a strong tendency for familial occurrence of some forms of depression suggesting a mechanistic cause for at least some forms of depression. The diagnosis of depression is made primarily by quantification of alterations in patients' mood. These evaluations of mood are generally performed by a physician or quantified by a neuropsychologist using validated rating scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Numerous other scales have been developed to quantify and measure the degree of mood alterations in patients with depression, such as insomnia, difficulty with concentration, lack of energy, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt. The standards for diagnosis of depression as well as all psychiatric diagnoses are collected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) referred to as the DSM-IV-R manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, 1994.<br>
As a yet further aspect, there is provided a method lor treating a disease selected from epilepsy, faintness attacks, hypokinesia, cranial disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, depression, anxiety, panic, pain, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathological disorders, visceral pain, functional bowel disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, pain associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, cystitis and pancreatitis comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) to a mammal in need of said treatment.<br>

Combinations of the compounds of the present invention and other therapeutic agents may be administered separately, sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.<br>
Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another.

Compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). The term "excipient" is used herein to describe any ingredient<br>
other than the compound of the invention. The choice of excipientwill to a large extent depend on the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosing form. If appropriate, auxiliaries can be added. Auxiliaries are preservatives, anti-oxidants, flavours or colourants.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in 'Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences', 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, multi-and nano-particulates, gels, films (incl. muco-adhesive), powder, ovules, elixirs, lozenges (incl. liquid-filled), chews, solid solution, liposome, suspensions, sprays and liquid formulations.<br>
Liquid formulations, include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered as osmotic dosage form, or in the form of a high energy dispersion or as coated particles or fast-dissolving,<br>
fast -disintegrating dosage form as described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11(6), 981-986 by Liang and Chen (2001).<br>
For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 wt% to 80 wt% of the dosage form, more typically from 5 wt% to 60 wt% of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropy! cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 wt% to 25 wt%, preferably from 5 wt% to 20 wt% of the dosage form.<br>
Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.<br>
Tablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 wt% to 5 wt% of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 wt% to 1 wt% of the tablet.<br>
Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt% of the tablet.<br>
Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.<br>
Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 wt% to about 90 wt% binder, from about 0 wt% to about 85 wt% diluent, from about 2 wt% to about 10 wt% disintegrant, and from about 0.25 wt% to about 10 wt% lubricant.<br>
Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.<br>
The formulation of tablets is discussed in "Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1", by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., N.Y., 1980 (ISBN 0-8247-6918-X).<br>
Solid compositions for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release compositions include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Suitable modified release compositions for the purpose of the invention are described in US Patent No, 6.106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Verma et al., Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), ,1-14 (2001).<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in capsules such as gelatin, starch or HPMC capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. Liquid compositions may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules such as gelatin capsule. For aqueous and oily suspensions, solutions, syrups and/or elixirs, the compounds of the invention may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with<br>
diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, alginic acid or sodium alginate, glycerin, oils, hydrocolloid agents and combinations thereof. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds and excipients may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicles before use.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally, intraarterially, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially, intraspinally or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion, needle (including micro-needle) injectors, needle-free injectors or implant injection techniques. For such parenteral administration they are typically used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion (or system so that can include micelles) which may contain other substances known in the art, for example, enough salts or carbohydrates such as glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. For some forms of parenteral administration they may be used in the form of a sterile non-aqueous system such as fixed oils, including mono-or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions for example lyophilisation is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water) before use.<br>
The solubility of compound of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated in a more solid form for administration as an implanted depot providing long-term release of the active compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation. They are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example a dry blend with lactose, or a mixed component particle, for example with phospholipids) from a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist) or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark]) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide, a further perfluorinated hydrocarbon such as Perflubron (trade mark) or other suitable gas. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.<br>
In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compounds of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol (aqueous ethanol) or a suitable agent for dispersing, solubilising or extending release and a propellant(s) as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder formulation or suspension formulation for inhalation the compounds of the inv.ention will be micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically considered as less than 5 microns). Micronisation could be achieved by a range of methods, for example spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, use of supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation or by spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a<br>
performance modifier such as l-leucine, mannitol or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 ug to 20mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1ul to 100ul. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used in place of propylene glycol include glycerol or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.<br>
Compositions for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL)-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA). Modified release compositions include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formualtions for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. For such applications, the compounds of the invention can be suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid, water, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax,<br>
cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol, alcohols such as ethanol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated- see for example, J. Pharm. Sci., 88(10), 955-958 by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). The following may also be used; polymers, carbohydrates, proteins and phospolipids in the form of nanoparticles (such as niosomes or liposomes).<br>
Other means of topical administration include delivery by iontophoresis, electroporation, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and needle-free or microneedle injection (e.g. Powderjectâ¢, Biojectâ¢ etc.).<br>
Compositions for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release compositions include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be administered rectally, for example in the form of a suppository, pessary or enema. They may also be administered by vaginal route. For example, these compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritant excipient(s), such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquefy and/or dissolve in the cavity to release the drug.<br>
Compositions for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release compositions include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, bio-degradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) or non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and paniculate or vesicular systems such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer, such as crossed-linked polyacrylic<br>
acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer (e.g. hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, methyl cellulose), or a heteropolysaccharide polymer (e.g. gelan gum) may be incorporated together a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered using iontophoresis.<br>
Compositions for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release compositions include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be combined with soluble rnacromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. - As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
The term 'administered' includes delivery by viral or non-viral techniques. Viral delivery mechanisms include but are not limited to adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, herpes viral vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, and baculoviral vectors. Non-viral delivery mechanisms include lipid mediated transfection, lipsomes, immunoliposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial amphiphiles (CFAs) and combinations thereof. The routes for such delivery mechanisms include but are not limited to mucosal, nasal, oral, parenteral, gastrointestinal, topical or sublingual routes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph or pro-drug thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.<br>
The element of the pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsules, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1 g according to the particular application and the potency of the active components. In medical use the drug may be administered one to three times daily as, for example, capsules of 100 or 300 mg. In therapeutic use, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg is preferred.<br>
The dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compounds being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compounds. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.<br>
The. pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can, if desired, also contain one or more compatible therapeutic agents. In particular, the composition can be combined with any one or more compounds useful in the treatment of pain, such as those listed above. Thus, the present invention presents a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), one or more other pharmacologically active agents and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to 'treatment' include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.<br>
