Polyketones<br>
This invention relates to polyketones and particularly, although not exclusively, relates to the preparation of polyketones, for example polyetheretherketone, of high purity.<br>
The thermoplastic aromatic polyketone polyetheretherketone has been known for over twenty years. EP 0 001 879 (Imperial Chemical Industries) describes its preparation and use. For example, it may be prepared by reaction of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone and hydroquinone in diphenylsulphone and in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate, for example potassium carbonate and/or sodium carbonate. After the reaction, the diphenylsulphone and inorganic salts are removed by washing successively with acetone (twice) , water (twice), and acetone/methanol (twice).<br>
EP 0 292 211 (Imperial Chemical Industries) describes a washing process for removing inorganic salt from an aryl polyether or aryl polythioether phase containing the inorganic salt, wherein the aryl polyether or aryl polythioether phase is initially in the form of a "toffee" and is caused to assume a liquid form by melting and/or dissolution in a solvent, for example diphenyl sulphone. The liquid mixture is contacted with water to dissolve salt out of the mixture.<br>
Polyetheretherketone has been commercially available for many years, initially from Imperial Chemical Industries (the applicant for the abovementioned patent application)  and  subsequently  from Vict rex  Pic,  the<br><br>
assignee     of     Imperial     Chemical     Industries.	However,<br>
notwithstanding attempts to remove inorganic salts from polyetheretherketone in the processes described, commercially available grades of polyetheretherketone (e.g. Victrex standard grade PEEK™ 450P) tend to have greater than 2 50ppm of alkali metal cations, for example Na+,   in  them.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to address problems associated with the purity of polyketones, for example polyetheretherketone.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of purifying a polymeric material of a type which includes:<br>
(A)	phenyl moieties;<br>

The main peak of the melting endotherm (Tm) for said polymeric material (if crystalline) may be at least 300°C.<br>
In preferred embodiments, said polymeric material is selected from polyetheretherketone and polyetherketone. In an especially preferred embodiment, said polymeric material is polyetheretherketone.<br>

The solvent formulation may be under a pressure of at least 10 bar, suitably at least 50 bar, preferably at least 100 bar, more preferably at least 130 bar, especially at least 160 bar, when contacted with said polymeric material. In some cases, the pressure may be 190 bar or greater. The pressure may be less than 3 00 bar, preferably less than 26 0 bar, more preferably less than 230 bar, especially less than 210 bar.

Whilst it is preferred for the temperature and pressure of the solvent formulation to be at or near the temperature and pressure used to purify the polymeric material in the method prior to contact with said polymeric material, in some cases, the solvent formulation may be contacted with said polymeric material and the temperature and pressure of the said formulation may then be adjusted.<br>
In the method, said solvent formulation may be caused to flow substantially continuously through said second region during said method.<br>
In the method, agitation means may be operated to agitate (e.g. stir) the polymeric material and/or said solvent formulation.<br>
In the method, solvent formulation may be contacted with said polymeric material over a period of at least 5 minutes, preferably at least 15 minutes, more preferably<br><br>

The method may be used to reduce the level of impurities of inorganic salts in said polymeric material. This is surprising since water is generally regarded as becoming more organic in character at temperatures above 100°C and at greater than ambient pressures. The difference between the level of a selected inorganic salt in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm salt, preferably at least lOppm salt, more preferably at least 25ppm salt and, especially, at least 50ppm salt. The level of said selected inorganic salt after said method may be less than 50ppm, preferably less than 25ppm. The ratio of the amount of a selected inorganic salt before contact with said solvent formulation to the level after purification in said method may be at least 1.5, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 3.<br>
The method may be used to reduce the level of alkali metal cationic impurities in said polymeric material. The difference between the total level of alkali metal cationic impurities in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the<br><br>
level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm M+ (where M+ represents alkali metal cations), preferably at least lOppm M+, more preferably at least 25ppm M+ and, especially, at least 50ppm M+. The total level of M+ in said polymeric material after said method may be less than 25ppm M+, is suitably less than 20ppm, is preferably less than 15ppm, is more preferably less than lOppm and is especially less than 5ppm. In some cases, the level may be 4ppm or less, 3ppm or less or even 2ppm or less. However, there may be at least a trace (e.g. at least O.lppm) of M+ in said polymeric material. The ratio of the amount of alkali metal cationic impurities in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation to the level after purification in said method may be at least 1.5, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 3.<br>
The method may be especially useful for reducing the level of Na+ impurities in said polymeric material. The difference between the level of Na+ in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm Na+, preferably at least lOppm Na+, more preferably at least 25ppm Na+ and, especially, at least 50ppm Na+. The level of Na+ in said polymeric material after said method may be less than 25ppm Na+, is suitably less than 2 0ppm, is preferably less than 15ppm, is more preferably less than lOppm and is especially less than 5ppm. In some cases, the level may be 4ppm or less, 3ppm or less or even 2ppm or less. There may be at least a trace (e.g. at least 0.1 ppm) of Na+ in said polymeric material. The ratio of the amount of Na+ impurities in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent<br><br>
formulation to the level after purification in said method may be at least 1.5, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 3.<br>
If K+ impurities are present in said polymeric material, then the level of such impurities may be reduced in the method. Where said polymeric material includes K+ impurities, the difference between the level of K+ in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm K+, preferably at least lOppm K+, more preferably at least 15ppm K+, especially at least 25ppm K+. The level of K+ in said polymeric material after said method may be less than 25ppm K+, suitably less than 2 0ppm, preferably less than 15ppm, more preferably less than lOppm, especially less than 5ppm, more preferably less than lOppm, especially less than 5ppm. In some cases, the level may be 4ppm or less, 3ppm or less or 2ppm or less. If K+ impurities are present in said polymeric material before treatment a trace (e.g. at least 0. Ippm) of K+ may be present in said polymeric material after treatment.<br>
The level of Al3+ in said polymeric material after treatment is preferably less than 25ppm Al*3, suitably less than 20ppm, preferably less than 15ppm, more preferably less than lOppm, especially less than 5ppm. In especially preferred embodiments the level of Al3+ is less than 3ppm, less than Ippm and, preferably, the level is Oppm.<br>
If F" impurities are present in said polymeric material, then the level of such impurities may be reduced<br><br>
in the method. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, said polymeric material may include fluorine end groups and that such groups are not to be regarded as impurities in the context described. Where said polymeric material includes F" impurities, the difference between the level of F" in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm F", preferably at least lOppm, especially at least 15ppm. The level of F' in said polymeric material after said treatment may be less than 25ppm F", suitably less than 20ppm, preferably less than 15ppm, more preferably less than lOppm, especially less than 5ppm.<br>
Preferably, the molecular weight of the polymeric material is unchanged by purification thereof in the method. Preferably, in the method no covalent bonds within the polymeric material are broken. End atoms or groups of the polymeric material, for example fluorine end groups which may be produced in certain processes for preparing polyketones, may not be affected by the process. Thus, the levels of a selected end group (e.g. a fluorine end group) in the polymeric material before and after purification in the method are substantially identical.<br>
If Cl" impurities are present in said polymeric material, then the level of such impurities may be reduced in the method. Where said polymeric material includes Cl" impurities, the difference between the level of Cl" in said polymeric material before contact with said solvent formulation compared to the level after purification in said method may be at least 5ppm Cl", preferably at least lOppm, especially at least 15ppm.

The levels of ions and/or atoms described herein may be assessed using ICPAES (Inductive Coupling Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy).<br>
In the method, it is also suprising to note that the level of residual solvent in the polymeric material may be reduced. In this regard, in the polymerisation process for preparation of said polymeric material, a sulphur-<br><br>
based solvent e.g. a sulphone such as diphenylsulphone or a strong acid such as an alkane sulphonic acid may be used. Solvents used may have boiling points or sublimation temperatures of at least 150°C, suitably at least 190°C. The boiling/sublimation temperatures may be less than 500°C, preferably less than 400°C, Residual solvent can often be detected in the polymeric material. However, the method of the present invention may be used to reduce the level of residual solvent. The ratio of the level of a selected residual solvent before purification in the method to the level after purification in the method may be at least 5, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 25, especially at least 50. In some cases, said ratio may be at least 100.<br>
Said polymeric material is preferably in solid form when" contacted with said solvent formulation. Said polymeric material is preferably not in the form of "toffee" - that is, a material which is highly viscous at a temperature of 150*C.<br>
Suitably, less than 10wt%, preferably less than 5wt%, more preferably less than lwt%, especially less than 0.5wt% of polycondensation solvent, for example diphenyl sulphone, is associated with said polymeric material immediately prior to contact with said solvent formulation in the method.<br>
The method may also be used to reduce the level of any other residual reactants used in the preparation of the polymeric material. Such residual reactants may be for example monomers or may be other reactants such as end-cappers or chain terminators.  The residual reactants are<br><br>
suitably organic compounds. In some embodiment, they may be aromatic compounds and/or ethers such as optionally-alkylated benzene compounds, alkoxy benzenes or diphenylethers.<br>
The method may be carried out on solid polymeric material in any physical form, for example powder, pellets or granules. It may be particularly advantageously applied to a said polymeric material which is microporous. In some embodiments, the method may be used to purify a surface region of said polymeric material so that the bulk of the polymeric material includes a greater level of impurities compared to a surface region thereof.<br>
Said polymeric material may be in the form of a shaped article. For example, said polymeric material may be in the form of a moulded or extruded article, rather than in the form of a raw material (e.g. powder, pellets or granules) . Said shaped article may be for use in the electronics industry, for example it may be a wafer carrier; or it may be for use in the medical industry, for example by being a part of a medical device or other component arranged to contact body tissues or fluids of living persons or animals. By subjecting such a shaped article to said method, a shaped article of greater purity may be formed and such an article may be particularly advantageously used in the electronics or medical industries. In some cases, a shaped article may be subjected to the method to purify a surface region thereof as described above. It should be appreciated that removing impurities from the surface region may be extremely advantageous for certain applications.<br><br>
Advantageously, a single purification step may be used to purify said polymeric material. In this regard, the polymeric material may be arranged in a receptacle and subjected to said temperature greater than 100°C and said pressure above ambient pressure for a sufficient time to purify the polymeric material a desired amount. Thus, in said single step, the temperature may remain substantially constant (e.g. it may vary by +/-20°C or less) and the pressure may remain substantially constant (e.g. it may vary by +/-20 bar or less). However, in some embodiments, two purification steps may be used. In a first step, the temperature and pressure used may remain substantially constant (as described above) and, subsequently, there may be a second step which is similar to the first step except that a different temperature and/or pressure may be used. Suitably the different temperature/pressure is higher than those used in the first step.<br>

The preparations of some of the monomers described herein are described in P M Hergenrother, B J Jensen and S J Havens, Polymer 2^, 358 (1988) , H R Kricheldorf and U Delius, Macromolecules 22^, 517 (1989) and P A Staniland, Bull, Soc, Chem, Belg., ££ (9-10), 667 (1989).<br>

Specific embodiments of the invention will now te described, by way of example, with reference to figure 1 which is a schematic representation of a purification apparatus.<br>
The purification apparatus shown in figure 1 includes a pressure vessel 2 which has a heated and thermally insulated j acket 4. Upstream of the vessel is a water supply line 6 for delivering pressurised water into the vessel 2. Water enters the supply line 6 at inlet 8 and is pumped to the vessel 2 by a water pump/compressor 10. Downstream of the vessel 2 there is a water drain 12 for removing water to waste.<br>
In use, a sample of polyketone is placed in the vessel 2 and then liquid water at high pressure and temperature is caused to flow through the vessel whereby relatively pure polyketone can be prepared.<br>
Unless otherwise stated in the following examples, the levels of components in ppm were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICPAES). The technique is a multi-element analysis technique that uses an inductively coupled plasma source to dissociate the sample into its constituent atoms and ions, exciting them to a level where they emit light of a characteristic wavelength. .A detector measures the intensity of the emitted light, and calculates the concentration of that particular element in the sample.<br>
At the temperatures  involved  (10000°C)  even the most<br><br>
refractory elements are atomised with high efficiency. ICP -AES therefore has a detection limit which is typically 1-10 ppb. Thus, the technique measures the level of elements irrespective of the form (e.g. as ions or covalently bonded to other atoms). In the method, a sample to be assessed is split into two portions and placed in platinum crucibles. These platinum crucibles are placed in a muffle furnace at 575°C, along with two further empty platinum crucibles as blanks. The samples are ashed overnight and the residues dissolved in 70% nitric acid (doubly distilled, Aldrich Chemical Company, UK) . The samples are then analysed in duplicate in a Perkin Elmer Optima 43 0 0DV ICP-AES machine and the results adjusted to account for the blank samples.<br>
In a series of specific examples, 2-8g samples of polyetheretherketone powder (PEEK™ 45 OP obtained from Victrex Pic of Thornton Cleveleys, UK; melting point 343*C) having about 125ppm of Na* were placed in vessel 2 and were contacted with liquid water at 320 #C and 200 bar. The water was arranged to flow through the vessel at a flow rate of 1-3ml/minute and the total extraction time (ie. the time for which the powder is contacted with water) was 60 minutes. The polymer was dried at 14 0 "C under vacuum. It was found that the sodium content of the polyetheretherketone was reduced to 3ppm or lower.<br>
Example 2<br>
A sample of milled extruded rods of polyetheretherketone polymer (7.5g)-(melting point 343°C) having approximately 220,000ppm of Na+ was placed in vessel 2 and was contacted with liquid water at 320°C and<br><br>
200bar. The water was arranged to flow through the vessel at a flow rate of l-3ml/minute and the total extraction time (ie. the time for which the powder is contacted with water) was 120 minutes. The polymer was dried at 14 0°C under vacuum. It was found that the sodium content of the polyetheretherketone was reduced to 12ppm. The end groups of the extracted polymer were analysed by 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy which showed that the level of fluorine ended chains had not changed as a result of the extraction.<br>
Examples 3-6<br>
The procedure of Example 2 was repeated for Examples 3-6. The variations in conditions and the resultant analysis of the product are summarised in Table 1 below in addition to the level of elements present in the polyetheretherketone prior to extraction. The reference N/D in the table means "not determined".<br><br>
Table 1<br>
&gt; isxampj-e /<br>
A sample of powdered polyetheretherketone polymer (8 00g)(melting point 343°C) having approximately llOppm of Na+ was placed in vessel 2 and was contacted with liquid i water at 275°C and 60bar. The water was arranged to flow through the vessel at a flow rate of 6.251/hr and the total extraction time (ie. the time for which the powder is contacted with water) was 4 hours. The polymer was dried at 140°C under vacuum. It was found that the sodium content of the polyetheretherketone was reduced to 0.7ppm. This was accompanied by a reduction in the level of Al<br><br>
from 2.7ppm to 
Examples 8 and 9<br>
The procedure of Example 7 was repeated for Examples 8 and 9. The variations in conditions and the resultant analysis of the products are summarised in Table 2 below. The levels of elements present in the polyetheretherketone prior to treatment are stated in the table.<br><br><br>
Example 10<br>
A sample of purified polyetherethereketone polymer (7.5g) (melting point 343°C) having approximately 12ppm of Na+ was placed in vessel 2 and was contacted with liquid water (45ml) at 275°C and 60bar. The polymer was allowed to soak in the water for 4 hours and then cooled and washed once by immersion in ultra pure water (obtained using on Elga Purelab E5/E10 water purification system which employs both ion-exchange and reverse osmosis to produce water with 15-16 MQcm"1 resitivity) followed by draining with ultrapure water (45ml). The polymer was dried at 14 0°C under vacuum. The difference in the level of residual ionics before and after extraction is shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Example 11<br>
A sample of commercially available Gharda (GATONE) 53 00G polyetheretherketone was obtained and was found to contain 190ppm of sodium. A 5g portion of milled granules of the sample was washed with 6 litres of hot demineralised water by placing it in a glass teaching column with a glass sinter and passing 6 litres of demineralised water at 70-80°C though it. The sample was dried in an air oven overnight and when analysed was found to contain 165ppm of sodium.<br>
A further 5g of the milled granules were extracted using apparatus similar to that show in figure 1, using superheated water at 2 75°C and 60 bar for 4 hours at a flow rate of 5.75l/h. The sample was then analysed by ICP-AES and compared with the results from the original sample.  The details of the analysis are shown in Table 4<br><br><br>
From these results it would appear that whilst superheated water extraction of milled granules is not as effective as a similar extraction on a microporous powder, it does provide a significant reduction in the level of ionic impurities, both from the surface and from the bulk. In the example, sodium and phosphorous levels were reduced by &gt;50%. Thus, the process allows the removal of ionics from polymers to obtain levels of residual ionics which would not be possible by traditional washing techniques.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
Diphenyl sulphone (DPS) is a solvent used in the preparation of polyketones according to the method described in EP0001879 (Imperial Chemical Industries). The level of extractable DPS in polyetheretherketone powder prepared as described in EP0001879 was determined by extracting the powder with acetone at ambient temperature and assessing the level by Gas Chromatography. 0.053%wt DPS was detected in the polymer. The purified polyetheretherketone polymer of Example 6 was assessed in a similar manner but it was not possible to detect any DPS in the polymer. The purified polyetheretherketone polymer was also analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography gas spectrometry (TDGCMS) at 360°C and DPS was detected. However, it was noted that the level of residual DPS was at least two orders of magnitude lower than in the polyetheretherketone polymer before purification.<br>
