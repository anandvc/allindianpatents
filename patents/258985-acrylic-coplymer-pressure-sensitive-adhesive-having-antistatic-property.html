				<td>ACRYLIC PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVE HAVING ANTISTATIC PROPERTY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition having antistatic property, more precisely, an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive resin composition having excellent durability and antistatic property as well. Background Art<br>
Acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive compositions have been widely used in industry for the production of industrial sheet, optical pressure sensitive adhesive product, and pressure sensitive adhesive for electrical components, etc, and arc applied to other industrial fields with the same conception.<br>
Among many products, liquid crystal display (LCD) is taking the place ofCRT lo be used in various high-tech fields producing notebook computer, monitor, TV. etc, owing to its potential for weight reduction and slimness.<br>
In general, to produce LCD, liquid crystal cell and polarizer are basically required, and for the adhesion of the two, proper pressure sensitive adhesive layer should be applied. Polarizer includes multilayer such as a row of iodine compounds or dichroie polarizing material, protective film, such as triacctyl cellulose (TAG), to protect polarizing clement on both sides, pressure sensitive adhesive layer, and releasing film. etc.<br>
The production of LCD includes the process of adhering polarizer, during which static electricity is generated after peeling releasing film out of pressure sensitive adhesive layer. The generated static electricity affects orientation of liquid crystal in LCD. resulting in defectives.<br>
Generation of static electricity can be inhibited by forming antistatic layer outside polari/er, whose effect is, though, loo low to prevent the fundamental generation of static electricity. Therefore, in order to pi-event the generation of static electricity in the first place, it is important for a pressure sensitive adhesive to have an antistatic property.<br>
To solve the problem of static electricity, various attempts have been made such as adding metal powders having conductivity or conductive components such as carbon particles lo pressure sensitive adhesive, adding ionic substances like surfactants lo pressure sensitive adhesive, etc. However, in order for conductive components or carbon particles to prevent the generation of static electricity, a large amount of them has to be added, dropping the transparency. And the addition of surfactants lo pressure sensitive adhesive<br>
results in the decrease of the pressure sensitive adhesive property by transitivity to the surface of the pressure sensitive adhesive and the product vulnerable for humidity.<br>
An attempt has been made to prevent the generation of static electricity by making a pressure sensitive adhesive flexible by adding elhylene oxide denatured phlhalic acid dioctyl plasticizer to the pressure sensitive adhesive (Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-140519). However, the addition of such plasticizer only cannot prevent the fundamental generation of static electricity and not to eliminate static electricity remaining after the separation of releasing film, either.<br>
In Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-128539, it is described that static electricity is prevented by mixing polycthcr polyol compound and at least one of alkali metallic salt to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive. But, when polyether polyol compound is added to a pressure sensitive adhesive having isocvanate crosslinking agent, the crosslinking degree is affected greatly. To avoid of such affection on the crosslinking degree, the inventors of the above patent tried to make crosslinking first by using isocvanate crosslinking agent, and then dissolved the composition again to mix polyether polyol compound and added alkali metallic salt thereto. However, such processes are very difficult to be applied in real industry.<br>
Therefore, it is required to develop a pressure sensitive adhesive having excellent antistatic property without changing of compatibility and durability.<br>
Thus, the present inventors tried to solve the above mentioned problems, and found that the generation of static electricity can be satisfactorily inhibited when ester plasticizer having excellent compatibility and at least one of ether bonds in its molecule and alkali metallic salt are added together to a pressure sensitive adhesive. And, the present inventors completed this invention by producing an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition having antistatic property without damaging durability by adding the above ester plastici/er and alkali metallic salt together to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive. Disclosure of Invention Technical Solution<br>
The above objects of the present invention can be achieved by the preferred embodiments of the invention described hereinafter.<br>
The present invention relates to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition having antistatic property, more precisely, an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition containing ester plasticizer having at least one of ether bonds and alkali metallic salt.<br>
The present invention provides an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition comprising<br>
a)	100 weight part of acrylic copolymer;<br>
b)	0.01 - 20 weight part of ester plastici/.er having at least one of ether bonds,<br>
represented by formula 1:<br>
c)	0.001 - 7 weight part of alkali metallic salt; and<br>
d)	0.01 - 10 weight part of<br>
The ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds is represented by the following formula 1.<br>
ChemistryFigurc 1<br>
Wherein, Rl and R2 are independently C1-C20 alkyl or aryl, R3 is H or methyl, and n is an integer of 2-20.<br>
More precisely, the acrylic copolymer of a) is characteristically prepared by the copolymeri/ation of 90-99.9 weight part of (ineth)acrylic acid ester monomer having Cl -C 12 alkyl and 0.1-10 weight part of vinyl and/or acrylic monomer having a functional group capable ofcrosslinking.<br>
The present invention also provides a polarizer containing the above acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition as a pressure sensitive adhesive layer on one side or both sides of polari/ing film.<br>
The polarizer can additionally contain one or more layers selected from a group consisting of protective layer, reflecting layer, phase retardation Him, compensation film for wide view angle and brightness enhancing film.<br>
The present invention further provides a liquid crystal display containing liquid crystal panel in which above polarizer is adhered on one side or both sides of liquid crystal cell.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
The present invention endowed enhanced antistatic property to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive by adding ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds and alkali<br>
metallic salt together to the pressure sensitive adhesive. This attempt was made based on the theory that tonic conductivity is given to a pressure sensitive adhesive by forming complex with ether bonds among ester plasticizer molecules and cations of alkali metallic salt. In particular, ester plastici/er having ether bonds is a key factor to enhance compatibility, durability, and antistatic property of a pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
Each component of the above pressure sensitive adhesive is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer having C1-C12 alkyl is included by 90-99.9 weight part for 100 weight part of the acrylic copolymcr. When the content is lower than 90 weight part, the initial peel strength is decreased, and when the content is higher than 99.9 weight part, cohesion becomes dropped, resulting in the low durability.<br>
As a (mcth)acrylic acid ester monomer having Cl -C 12 alkyl. Cl -C 12 alkyl ester can be used. In particular. C2-C8 alkyl ester is preferred. When alkyl of the alkyl(meth)acrylate is in the form of long chain, cohesion of the pressure sensitive adhesive drops. Thus, to maintain the cohesion under high temperature, C1-C12 alkyl is preferably used, and C2-C8 alkyl is more preferred. The (melh)acrylic acid ester monomer having Cl -C 12 alkyl is exemplified by butyl(meth)acrylate. 2-eth\lhexyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, methvl(meth)acrylate, n- propyl(meth)acryiate. isopropyl(meth)acrylate, t-buty](mcth)acry)ate, pcntyl(meth)acrylate. n-octyl(mcth)acrylatc. isooctylCmettyacrylatc, or isononyl(meth)acrylate, etc, and these can be used independently or jointly.<br>
In the present invention, copolymer monomer can be additionally included in acrylic copolymerto regulate the glass transition temperature of a pressure sensitive adhesive or to endow other functional properties thereto. At this time, monomers such as acrylonitrille, (meth)acrylamide, styrene, methylstyrene, vinylloluene. glycidy!(meih)acrylale or vinylacetate are preferably used.<br>
Vinyl monomer and acrylic monomer of a) having a functional group capabJe of crosslinking endow cohesion or peel strength by chemical bond not to destroy cohesion of a pressure sensitive adhesive by high temperature or high humidity by reacting with other crosslinking agents.<br>
The preferable content of vinyl monomer and acrylic momoncr of a) or the mixture of them having a functional group capabJe of crosslinking. is 0.1-10 weight part. When the content of a monomer having a functional group capable of crosslinking is less than 0. i weight part, the cohesion is easily broken under high temperature or high humidity,<br>
The ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds is represented by the following formula 1.<br>
[Chemistry Figure 1]<br>
(Figure Remove)Wherein, Rl and R2 are independently C1-C20 alky! or aryl. R3 is H or methyl, and n is an integer of 2-20.<br>
The preferable content of the ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds, presented by formula I, is 0.01-20 weight part for !00 weight part of the acrylic copolymer of the above a). When the content of ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds is less than 0.01 weight part, it cannot properly form a complex with alkali metallic salt, resulting in the decrease of antistatic property. In the meantime, the content of the plasticizer is over 20 weight part, cohesion of a pressure sensitive adhesive is reduced, resulting in the decrease of durability.<br>
The ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds, represented by formula 1, is exemplified by dielhylene glycol di-2-elhylhexonate, letraelhylene glycot di- 2-cthylhexonate, polyethylene glyeol di-2-ethylhexonate. triethylcnc glycol di- eth\ Ibutylatc. polyethylene glycol diethylbutylate. polypropylene glycol di- ethylhexonate. triethylene glycol dibenxonale. polyethylene glycol diben/onate, polypropylene glycol diben/onate, polyethylene glycol-2-ethylhexonate benzonate, etc. and these plasticizers can be used independently or jointly.<br>
The alkali metallic salt of the above c) is also involved in antistatic property by forming a complex together with ether bonds of ester plasticizer of the above b). The addition of alkali metallic salt itself endows antistatic property to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive, and the co-treatment with ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds enhances ionic conductivity.<br>
It is preferred for the alkali metallic salt to be included by 0.001-7 weight part to 100 weight part of the acrylic copolymer of a). When the content of alkali metallic salt is less<br>
resulting in the lowering effect on peel strength. On the contrary, when the content of such monomer is more than 10 weight part, compatibility is remarkably decreased, causing surface migration, fluidity is reduced and cohesion is increased, losing stress relaxation.<br>
The monomer having a functional group capable of crosslinking is exemplified by-monomers containing hydroxy such as 2-hydroxycthyl(meth)acrylate. 2-hydtoxypropyl(meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybuty|(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyleneglycol(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyleneglycol(meth)acrylate, and monomers containing carboxylic acid such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid dimer, itaconic acid, maleic acid, and maleic anhydride, etc. but not always limited thereto. These monomers can be used independently or jointly.<br>
It is preferred to eliminate factors generating bubbles such as volatile components, reaction residues, etc, from a pressure sensitive adhesive, before using. When elastic modulus of a pressure sensitive adhesive is too low, resulted from low crosslinking density or molecular weight, bubbles generated between glass substrate and pressure sensitive adhesive layer at high temperature are growing to form a scalierer in inside of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer, fn the meantime, when a pressure sensitive adhesive with high elastic modulus is applied, edge lifting is observed at the end of pressure sensitive adhesive sheet, resulted from excessive crosslinking reaction.<br>
The viscoelastic property of a pressure sensitive adhesive depends on molecular weight of polymer chain, distribution of molecular weight, or abundant numbers of molecular structures, and in particular it might be determined by molecular weight. Thus, the preferable molecular weight of acrylic copolymer used in the present invention is 800,000-2,000,000 and the copolymer of the invention can be prepared by the conventional radical copolymerization.<br>
The method for the production of acrylic copolymer of the present invention is no( limited to a specific one but solution polymerization, photo-polymerization, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization, and emulsion polymerization are preferred and in particular solution polymerization is more preferred, ft is also preferred to set the temperature between 50-140°C, and to add an initiator after monomers are evenly mixed.<br>
In the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention, ester plaslici/er having one or more ether bonds, represented by formula 1, in the above b) forms a complex together with alkali metallic salt of the above c), resulting in ionic conductivity of the pressure sensitive adhesive. The ester plasticizcr is optically transparent and has excellent compatibility and no surface migration.<br>
than 0.001 weight part, it is difficult to form a complex together with ether bonds of ester piasticizer, resulting in the decrease of antistatic property. When the content of alkali metallic salt is over 7 weight part, crystallization is occurred, resulting in the decrease of transparency and durability of a pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
The alkali metallic salt is composed of cations and anions. Precisely, the alkali metallic salt is composed of a kind of ionic combination made from a cation selected from a group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, barium, and cesium and an anion selected from a group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, perclorate, trifluoromethanesulfoaate, hexafluorophosphate. tetraborate, and carbonate, and is used independently or jointly.<br>
!n the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention, the multifunctional crosslinking agent of the above d) increases cohesion of the pressure sensitive adhesive by reacting with carboxy] and hydroxy. The prefcrabte content of the crosslinking agent is 0.01-10 weight part for 100 weight part of acrylic copolymer of a).<br>
The multifunctional crosslinking agent can be selected among isocyanate, epoxy, aztridine, metal chelate crosslinking agents, etc. and in particular isocyanate crosslinking agent is preferred. Isocyanate cross!inking agent is exemplified by tolylene diisocyanate, xyiene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, isoform diisocyanate. tetramethyl xyiene diisocyanate, naphthalene diisocyanate, and their reactants with polyol like trimethylolpropane, etc.<br>
The epoxy crosslinking agent is exemplified by ethyleneglycol diglycidylether, triglycidylether, trimethylolpropane triglycidylether, N.M.N'IS'-tctraglycidylcthylencdiaminc, glycerine diglycidylether, etc.<br>
The aziridine crosslinking agent is exemplified by N,N'-loluene-2,4-bis(l-a/.iridinecarboxide),<br>
N,N' -diphenylmethane-4,4' -bis{ 1 -aziridinecarboxide), triethylenemelamine, bisiso-protaloyl-l-(2-methylaziridine). tri-1 -aziridinylphosphineo.xide, etc.<br>
As a metal chelate crosslinking agent, compounds prepared by coordination of multivalent metal such as Al. Fe, Zn, Sn. Ti. Sb, Mg, and V with acethvlacetone or ethyl acetoacetate can be used.<br>
A preparation method of the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention is not limited to a specific one but in general, it is produced by mixing an acrylic copolymer and a crosslinking agent.<br>
At this time, a crosslinking reaction of functional groups of a crosslinking agent must not be induced for even coating during the mixing process to form pressure sensitive adhesive layer. After coating, a crosslinking structure is formed through dryness and aging, resulting in a pressure sensitive adhesive layer having a strong elasticity and cohesion. By the strong cohesion, pressure sensitive adhesive property such as durability and cutting characteristic of a pressure sensitive adhesive product are enhanced.<br>
The proper crosslinking density of the acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention is 5-95%, for the optimum substantial balance. The crosslinking density is calculated by the conventional quantification method of gel content in acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive, which calculates the parts forming a crosslinking structure dissoluble in a solvent by weight%. When the crosslinking density of the pressure sensitive adhesive is under 5%, cohesion of the pressure sensitive adhesive is reduced, causing weakness of durability, to form bubbles or induce edge lifting. On the contrary, when the crosslinking density is over 95%, durability is remarkably reduced.<br>
The pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention can ad-1 ditionally include silane coupling agent, which is able to enhance thermal/moisture resistance by improving pressure sensitive adhesive stability on the glass substrate. Such silane coupling agent plays a role in the increase of peel strength when it is left for a long time under high temperature and high humidity. The preferable content of silane coupling agent is 0.005-5 weight part for 100 weight part of an acrylic copolymer.<br>
The silane coupling agent is exemplified by y-glycydoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, y-glycydoxypropyl melhyldiethoxysilane. y-glycydoxypropyl trielhoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane. vinyl trimethoxysilane, vinyl triethoxysilane, y-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane. y-methacryloxypropyl triethoxysilane, y-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, y-aminopropyl triethoxysilane, 3-isocyanatepropyl triethoxysilane. y-acetoacetatepropyl trimethoxysilane. etc. These silane coupling agents can be used independently or jointly.<br>
To regulate the pressure sensitive adhesive property, a pressure sensitive adhesive resin can be additionally added to the tackifier of the present invention, and the content thereof is determined in the range of 1-100 weight part for 100 weight part of an acrylic copolymer. At this time, when the tackificr is over-treated, compatibility and cohesion of a pressure sensitive adhesive decrease, so the content of the pressure sensitive adhesive resin has to be properly regulated.<br>
The tackifier is exemplified by (hydrogenated)hydrocarbon resin, (hydrogenated)rosin resin, (hydrogenated)rosinester resin, (hydrogenated)terpene resin, (hydrogenated)terpenetenol resin, polymerized rosin resin, and polymerized rosinester resin, etc, and these resins can be used singly or jointly.<br>
In addition, to achieve the objects of the present invention, acrylic low molecular weight substances, epoxy resins and hardners can be additionally included. UV stabilizers, aniioxidanls, coloring agents, reinforcing agents, fillers, ami foaming agents, surfactants, plasticizer, etc, can also be added.<br>
The present invention further provides a polarizer containing the acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive composition as a pressure sensitive adhesive layer of polarizing film.<br>
The polarizer of the present invention has a pressure sensitive adhesive layer formed from the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the invention on one side or both sides of the polarizing film. Polarizing film or polarizing device forming polarizer is not limited to a specific one.<br>
However, it is preferred to prepare the polari/ing film by elongation by adding a polarizing component such as iodine or dichroic dye onto poly vinyl alcohol resin film, and there is no limitation in thickness of polari/ing film, which means conventional thickness of film is accepted. As a polyvinyl alcohol resin, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl acetal and ethylene, saponified vinyl acetate copolymer, etc can be used.<br>
On both sides of the polarizing film, protective films arc laminated to form a multilayer film, and the protective films are cellulose film such as triacetyl cellulose, etc, polyester film such as polycarbonate film, polyethylene terephthalate, etc, polyether sulphone film, polyolcfin film including those having the structure of polyethylene, polypropylene, cyclo or norbornene. and ethylene propylene copolymer. The thickness of such protective films is not fixed and conventional film thickness is accepted.<br>
A method for forming pressure sensitive adhesive layer on polarizing film is not limited, either, but generally, a method comprising the steps of coating the pressure sensitive adhesive directly on the surface of the polarizing film with Bar Coatcr and then drying thereof, or a method comprising the steps of coating the pressure sensitive adhesive on the surface ofdissecting substrate, drying, transfer! ng of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer formed on the surface of the dissecting substrate onto the surface of polarizing film, and aging is applicable.<br>
The polarizer of the present invention can include one or more additional layers providing supplementary functions, which might be protective layer, reflecting layer, phase retardation film, compensation film for wide view angle and brightness enhancing film.<br>
The polari/er loaded with the pressure sensitive adhesive of the present invention can he applied to every LCD generally used, and liquid crystal panel is not limited. It is preferred in the present invention to construct LCD including liquid crystal panel prepared by conjugating the pressure sensitive adhesive polarizer lo one side or both sides of liquid crystal cell.<br>
The acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive resin composition of the present invention can be widely used without limitation, for example for industrial sheet in particular reflective sheet, structural pressure sensitive adhesive sheet, photographic pressure sensitive adhesive sheet, lane marking pressure sensitive adhesive sheet, optical pressure sensitive adhesive product, pressure sensitive adhesive for electronic components, etc. The pressure sensitive adhesive composition can also be applied to the equal operating field such as the production of multi-layer laminate products, for example general industrial pressure sensitive adhesive sheet products, medical patches, heat activated pressure sensitive pressure sensitive adhesives, etc.<br>
As explained hereinbefore, the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention has excellent long-term durability and improved antistatic property by containing ester plasticizer having one or more ether bonds and alkali metallic salt. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
