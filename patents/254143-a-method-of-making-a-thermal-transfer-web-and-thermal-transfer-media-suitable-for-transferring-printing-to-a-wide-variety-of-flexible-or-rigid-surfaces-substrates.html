Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to improved thermal transfer media and<br>
to improved methods of making and using thermal transfer media.<br>
The transfer media of the invention are useful for transferring<br>
printing to a wide variety of flexible or rigid surfaces or substrates<br>
such as fabric, painted surfaces, metal, wood, plastics, composite<br>
materials, and so on.<br>
It frequently happens that a product manufacturer will have a<br>
variety of products that need to be printed or marked with<br>
information, and that some of the information to be printed remains<br>
constant over many or all products in the product line while other<br>
information may vary from product-to-product within the product<br>
line.   The information that is the same from product-to-product in<br>
the product line can be termed "fixed information" and the<br>
information that varies from product-to-product can be termed<br>
"variable information."<br>
When the product manufacturer uses transfers to transfer<br>
printed information onto the products, without the present<br>
invention, the product manufacturer is required to use a different<br>
transfer containing both fixed and variable information for each<br>
different product within the product line.   This requires each<br>
product manufacturer to stock tens, hundreds, or thousands of<br>
different transfers, one transfer for each different product, although<br>
the products may vary by only a small amount of information, for<br>
example a serial number, a date code, country of origin, and/or size,<br>
and so on.   This can become an enormous burden and expense for<br><br>
both the transfer media manufacturer and the product<br>
manufacturers.   The transfer media manufacturer has the burden and<br>
expense of generating, identifying, tracking, handling and perhaps<br>
storing or inventorying possibly a tremendous number of different<br>
transfers for each product manufacturer and each product<br>
manufacturer in turn has the burden and expense of identifying,<br>
tracking, handling, and storing or inventorying a tremendous<br>
number of transfers.<br>
When using the transfers of the invention, the product<br>
manufacturer simply determines the fixed information and variable<br>
information and then again places an order for a transfer medium<br>
printed with only fixed information but which is capable of<br>
receiving any desired variable information.   The transfer media<br>
manufacturer then generates a large number of transfers containing<br>
only fixed information, and thereafter variable information can be<br>
added either by the transfer media manufacturer upon instruction<br>
from the product manufacturer, or the variable information can be<br>
printed by the product manufacturers.   In this way, the desired<br>
variable information is printed as needed.<br>
While the information is described in connection with the<br>
application of transfers to fabrics or garments, there is no intention<br>
to thereby limit the invention.   For example, a garment manufacturer<br>
may make many different garments in many different sizes.   The<br>
garment manufacturer may find it necessary or desirable to mark the<br>
garments with information, such as a logo, material content, country<br>
of origin, washing instructions, bleaching instructions, ironing<br>
instructions, drying instructions, various types of codes including<br><br>
code numbers, and size.   Frequently most or all this information<br>
except size is common to a large number of garments made by that<br>
garment manufacturer, however, it is possible for any or most of the<br>
normally fixed information to change.   For example, a product<br>
manufacturer may make products in different countries so that<br>
country of origin information can be variable information, and so<br>
on.<br>
A series of transfers or images disposed along the length of a<br>
transfer web can be partially printed or preprinted with the same<br>
information, namely, fixed information.   Later, as the need arises,<br>
the partially printed transfer medium such as a transfer web can be<br>
printed with various additional variable information.   For example,<br>
each printed image of fixed information on the transfer web can be<br>
supplemented with variable information, such as size information.<br>
A long web of transfer medium printed with fixed information<br>
produced in a long production run by a transfer media manufacturer<br>
can simply be wound into a large roll and subsequently printed with<br>
variable information or the long transfer medium with fixed<br>
information can be cut into shorter lengths and wound into two or<br>
more rolls which may be easier to handle and/or to distribute to<br>
different locations.   The transfer medium of the invention can be<br>
printed with fixed information on a high volume basis in one<br>
location, for example the transfer media can be printed at the<br>
transfer media manufacturer's location, and thereafter the variable<br>
information can be printed on an as-needed basis at the same<br>
location or at different locations by various parties such as a<br>
subcontractor or the garment manufacturers themselves.   It is not<br><br>
uncommon for a manufacturer such as a garment manufacturer to<br>
have different factories or locations where items requiring marking<br>
with both fixed and variable information are desired or required to<br>
be printed on a garment.   The roll(s) of transfer media can be sent to<br>
these different factories or locations and the variable information<br>
can be printed there.   The transfer medium of the invention is<br>
particularly suited to all these situations because previously<br>
prepared partially printed transfer medium containing only fixed<br>
information can be efficiently tailored to include variable<br>
information.  When a fully printed transfer medium is needed, the<br>
large toll, or the small roll, as the case may be, of partially printed<br>
transfer medium is passed through a relatively low-cost, small<br>
footprint, short-run printer that prints all the variable information.<br>
For example, partially printed transfer medium on either a large or a<br>
small roll can be threaded into a short-run printer.   The printer<br>
prints, for example, size information of one size, e.g., 2X/2XG, 50-52<br>
on some or all of the images in the variable-information zones on the<br>
transfer medium in that roll.   It may be that only part of the roll will<br>
need to be printed with variable information of the size indicated<br>
above, so some or all of the remainder of this transfer medium roll<br>
can be printed with information of a different size, e.g., size X/XL,<br>
46-48.   Thus, a length of transfer medium will have been printed<br>
with the same fixed information and differing variable information.<br>
This obviates the need for a large inventory of fully printed transfer<br>
media printed with both fixed and variable information.   It should<br>
be noted that while large, expensive, long-run equipment suitable<br>
for long production runs can produce long webs of transfer medium,<br><br>
it is not well suited to produce short runs because such long-run<br>
equipment needs to be repeatedly stopped/ changed over to print<br>
different variable information and restarted. This changeover results<br>
in some waste .of transfer medium, and the more frequently the<br>
equipment needs to be stopped, changed over and restarted, the less<br>
efficient the equipment is.   Also, such long-run equipment creates<br>
more waste than the above-described short-run printers.<br>
According to the invention, the improved thermal transfer<br>
medium and improved method of making such a transfer medium<br>
containing both fixed and variable information can be used to apply<br>
printed information to a fabric, and the printed label is capable of<br>
undergoing repeated laundering.   In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
fixed information is printed with a screen printing ink in a screen<br>
printing process, and the variable information is printed with a hot<br>
stamp ink in a hot stamp process.   While screen printing processes<br>
are frequently referred to as silk screen processes, the screen<br>
material used today comprises other materials such as synthetic<br>
polyester.   Therefore, the process is referred to as a screen process.<br>
Irrespective of the printing technology used, the inks should have<br>
the desired elasticity to perform well when applied to garments,<br>
which are inherently subject to stretching.   It is also preferred to<br>
provide a protective coating having sufficient elasticity, which<br>
protects the printed information during laundering.<br>
In particular in one embodiment, the improved thermal<br>
transfer medium is made by providing a carrier web, wherein one<br>
side of the carrier web has a release coating both in one or more<br>
fixed-information zone(s) capable of receiving fixed information and<br><br>
in one or more variable-information zone(s) capable of receiving<br>
variable information, optionally applying a protective coating over<br>
the release coating in the fixed information zone(s) and in the<br>
variable information zone(s), printing fixed information over any<br>
protective coating in the fixed-information zone(s), optionally<br>
applying a   contrasting-color coating over the printed fixed<br>
information in the fixed-information zone(s), applying an adhesive<br>
coating both to the fixed-information zone(s) including over the<br>
printed fixed information and the protective coating and to the<br>
variable-information zone(s) including over the protective coating,<br>
printing variable information over the adhesive in the variable-<br>
information zone(s), and optionally printing a contrasting color over<br>
the printed variable information.   If the color of the surface or<br>
substrate onto which the printing is to be transferred is light in<br>
color and assuming the ink is dark in color such as black, it may not<br>
be necessary or desirable to include a contrasting-color coating such<br>
as white in the transfer.   Likewise, if the color of the surface onto<br>
which the print is to be transferred is dark in color such as dark<br>
blue or black and assuming the printing ink is light in color such as<br>
white, it may not be necessary or desirable to include a contrasting-<br>
color coating such as black in the transfer.   However, if the product<br>
manufacturer desires the printing to be highlighted or if it is<br>
desired to print on a dark color substrate with a dark ink, then it<br>
may be desirable for the printing to have an underlying contrasting-<br>
color coating to provide an outline or a background for good<br>
readability of the printing.   In addition, in instances where the<br>
garment or other product is not subject to washing, abrasion or<br><br>
other rough handling, the protective coating may be omitted.   Also,<br>
if the printed information on a garment has sufficient color fastness<br>
without the protective coating or if a particular application does not<br>
require it, the protective coating can be omitted.<br>
The invention provides a thermal transfer medium in which<br>
adhesive is used to bond the printed information to the fabric or<br>
surface, wherein the printed fixed information is between an<br>
adhesive coating and a release coating, whereas the adhesive is<br>
between the printed variable information and the release coating.<br>
One specific embodiment of a thermal transfer medium for use<br>
in a hot stamp process includes a carrier web, a uniform release<br>
coating on the carrier web, a uniform adhesive coating on the<br>
release coating, and a uniform ink coating on the adhesive coating.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
With reference to Fig 1, there is shown a substrate such as a<br>
piece of flexible fabric 20 which may be part of a garment 54 (Fig.<br>
15) and a complete image comprised of printed information which<br>
has been transferred directly onto the fabric 20 from a thermal<br>
transfer medium in accordance with the invention.   As indicated<br><br>
above, the substrate can also be comprised of various other surfaces<br>
and materials.  The printed information shown in Fig. 1 includes<br>
information common to various products made by one manufacturer,<br>
in this case a particular garment manufacturer.   Thus, this<br>
information is termed "fixed information"which is shown in fixed-<br>
information zones 21 through 28.   This particular manufacturer uses<br>
the same fixed information in connection with various sizes of<br>
garments.   Therefore, the image also includes "variable information"<br>
in one or more variable-information zone(s) 29.   Although in this<br>
example only one variable-information zone is illustrated, another<br>
or other variable information zones can be provided.   As shown, the<br>
zone 21 bears the manufacturer's logo or other identification, the<br>
zone 22 contains the manufacturer's code, zone 23 contains the<br>
country of origin of the garment, zone 24 contains washing<br>
instructions, zone 25 contains bleaching instructions, zone 26<br>
contains drying instructions, zone 27 contains ironing instructions<br>
and zone 28 contains material content information.   Variable<br>
information zone 29 contains size information.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a thermal transfer web W partially printed with<br>
fixed information in fixed-information zones 21T through 28T and<br>
variable-information zone 29T is free of variable information.   The<br>
zones 21T through 29T correspond exactly to the zones 21 through 29<br>
of Fig. 1.   The web W is also printed with registration marks 30 at<br>
equally longitudinally spaced apart intervals corresponding to the<br>
images on the thermal transfer web W.   The images are repeated in<br>
the longitudinal direction along the web W.<br><br>
Fig. 3 is like to Fig. 2 except that Fig. 3 contains variable<br>
printed information in the variable-information zone 29T.<br>
With reference to Fig. 4, there is shown Station 1 which shows<br>
providing a flexible carrier preferably in the form of a carrier web C<br>
which had been wound into a roll.   The carrier web C can be plastic<br>
or cellulose-based.   Non-limiting examples of carrier web C include<br>
polyester or polypropylene films and papers.   In the case of silicone<br>
or wax-treated papers, the step of applying a release coating R can<br>
be omitted.   Station 2 shows that for each image a release coating R<br>
is applied onto or over the upper surface of the carrier web C.<br>
Release coating R can be any release coating known to persons<br>
skilled in the art.   A typical release coating R can comprise a waxy<br>
substance that softens or melts to facilitate release of the material to<br>
be transferred. The release coating R can be applied at a thickness<br>
of about  0.1 to about 1 thousandths of an inch, and preferably about<br>
0.2 to about 0.8 thousandths of an inch, after drying.   Station 3<br>
shows that a protective coating PC is applied onto or over the<br>
release coating R in each of zones 21T through 29T.   The pattern of<br>
the protective coating PC is better illustrated in Fig. 5, and as shown<br>
the pattern is printed in reverse.   As used herein, the term<br>
"protective coating" refers to a coating that protects the printed<br>
information and is sufficiently transparent such that the printed<br>
fixed and variable information can be read by example through the<br>
coating PC.   The protective coating can be clear or colorless, or it<br>
can be tinted or colored, so long as the desired printed fixed and<br>
variable information can be read for example by an individual.   It is<br>
preferred that the protective coating PC be composed of or include<br><br>
an ink which is preferably like ink used for printing the fixed<br>
information, but is free of pigment.   An important property of the<br>
protective coating is flexibility when the image is to be transferred<br>
to a flexible and/or stretchable substrate or surface such as a fabric<br>
garment.   After application to a garment, the resulting thermal<br>
transfer or image will undergo deformation, for example, when the<br>
garment is put on or taken of, or washed.   Therefore, in this<br>
application the protective coating is sufficiently flexible or elastic to<br>
deform.   For example, the protective coating should desirably be<br>
able to conform at least 25 percent, and up to about 400 percent, in<br>
any direction without forming cracks or other imperfections.   Also,<br>
the protective coating should have sufficient "memory" to return to<br>
the original size and shape after the deforming force is removed.<br>
Like the release coating R, the protective coating PC is preferably at<br>
a thickness of about 0.1 to about 1, and preferably about 0.2 to 0.8<br>
thousandths of an inch, after drying.   The chemical composition of<br>
the protective coating PC is not limited, as long as the coating has<br>
the above-described elasticity in connection with use on garments.<br>
In the event the transfer or image is applied to a solid or rigid<br>
surface which does not deform or stretch as indicated above, or the<br>
protective coating is not required to have all the above<br>
characteristics.<br>
Station 4 shows that a first color FC, e.g. black, is printed in<br>
zones 22T through 28T.   The printing which is done in reverse is<br>
shown in Fig. 6.   The printing in Fig. 6 in zones 21T through 28T<br>
falls just within the pattern shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, all the<br>
printing will always be entirely over the protective coating PC even<br><br>
though registration between the protective coating and the printing<br>
is not perfect but within reasonable tolerances.   The registration<br>
marks 30 are printed at the time the fixed information printing FC is<br>
done.  Station 5 illustrates printing in a second color SC, e.g. red, in<br>
the fixed-information zone 21T.   Further details of the printing in<br>
zone 21T is shown in Fig. 7.   Fig 6 shows a phantom outline P where<br>
the printing of Fig. 7 will occur at zone 21T.   In the event that all<br>
fixed information is in one color, e.g. black, then Station 5 is<br>
eliminated.   Alternatively, if there is printing in more than two<br>
colors, additional printing stations can be added.   In the event one<br>
or two contrasting-color coatings or printing CC are desired, they<br>
are applied at Station 6 aligned with but preferably slightly larger<br>
than any printing applied in Stations 4 and 5 so that the printing is<br>
more readily visible. When the article to which the transfer medium<br>
is to be applied is comprised of a fabric, the ink used is preferably<br>
wash resistant such that none of the printed information is<br>
destroyed, disturbed or otherwise affected after repeated washing of<br>
the garment.   The characteristics of the ink can vary according to the<br>
surface to which the transfer is to be applied, and/or to the type of<br>
printing technique which is used to print the information.   The ink<br>
should preferably have the same elasticity as the protective coating<br>
PC when the transfer is used to print onto fabric garments.<br>
Next a coating of adhesive A is applied in zones 21T through<br>
29T at Station 7.   Any suitable adhesive A can be used, and the<br>
characteristics may vary depending on the nature of the surface or<br>
substrate to which the transfer is to be applied.   For example, in the<br>
event the transfer is to be applied to a garment, the adhesive A is<br><br>
preferably about 1 to about 5, and most preferably about 1.5 to<br>
about 4 thousandths of an inch in thickness, after drying.   When the<br>
transfer is applied to a fabric, the adhesive A is not limited but it<br>
should have the elastic properties of the protective coating PC and<br>
the ink or inks which comprise the fixed and variable printing.   The<br>
profile of the area of adhesive A is slightly larger than the profile of<br>
the area of the protective coating in zones 21T through 29T.   The<br>
adhesive A is a heat-activated adhesive that is wet when applied but<br>
which dries so that it is dry to the touch.   In that the printed<br>
variable information 29 in the variable-information zone 29T is<br>
under the adhesive A after the printed variable information 29 has<br>
been transferred to the intended substrate, it is necessary that the<br>
adhesive A be clear enough so that the printed variable information<br>
29 in the variable information-zone 29T can be read through the<br>
adhesive A.   Therefore, the clearer the adhesive A the better.   This is<br>
in contrast to the printed fixed information 21 through 28 in the<br>
fixed-information zones 21T through 28T after the printed fixed<br>
information has been transferred to the intended substrate, because<br>
the adhesive A is under the printed fixed information 21 through 28.<br>
Therefore, in the fixed-information zones 21T through 28T, the<br>
clarity of the adhesive A does not affect the readability of the<br>
printed fixed information 21 through 28.   However, in the case of<br>
both the fixed information 21 through 28 and the variable<br>
information 29 it is not usually desirable to use an adhesive A that<br>
is highly visible because it provides an unnecessary background<br>
which may not be desired.   In one alternative embodiment, the<br>
amount of adhesive A is less per unit area in the variable-<br><br>
information zone 29T than in the fixed-information zones 21T<br>
through 28T so that the printed variable information, when<br>
transferred onto the substrate, is more highly visible through the<br>
adhesive A.   Ways of providing less adhesive A per unit area in the<br>
variable information zone 29T are to make the adhesive A in the<br>
variable-information zone 29T uniform but thinner than in the fixed-<br>
information zone 29T, or the adhesive A can be varigated.<br>
The relative overlapping between the release coating R, the<br>
protective coating PC, the printed first color FC, the printed second<br>
color SC, the contrasting-color coating CC, and the adhesive coating<br>
A is best illustrated in Fig. 10.   Fig. 10 shows that the release<br>
coating R has a larger profile or area than the profile of the<br>
protective coating PC, that the protective coating PC has a larger<br>
profile or area than the printing FC and SC, and that the profile or<br>
areas of the adhesive A are greater than that of the protective<br>
coating PC.   Following the application of the adhesive A, the<br>
partially printed web W is wound into a roll R1 as shown at Station<br>
8.   It is noted that the partially printed web W is flexible and<br>
dimensionally stable so that it can be rolled and unrolled as needed<br>
and the transfers or images it contains can be readily applied to<br>
contoured surfaces or to yieldable materials such as fabrics or<br>
garments.   The web W can also be used to transfer images onto<br>
fabric tape.<br>
With reference to FIG. 8, there is diagrammatically illustrated<br>
long-run equipment 31 with stations 32 through 35 for roll-to-roll<br>
printing and coating.   A carrier in the form of a carrier web C<br>
wound into a roll 36 passes successively to stations 32 through 35<br><br>
after which the carrier web C is wound into a roll 37.   The carrier<br>
web C is preferably flexible, protective and clear or sufficiently<br>
transparent film so that the location of the printed information, and<br>
preferably the printing itself, is visible through the carrier web or<br>
film from the carrier-web or film side.   This is useful when<br>
registering the transfer or image with the product to which transfer<br>
or image is to be applied.   The stations 32 through 35 in the<br>
illustrated embodiment are equipped to be printing and coating<br>
stations.   In this illustrated embodiment the printing and coating<br>
stations 32 through 35 are screen printing stations, although other<br>
printing techniques described herein can be used at these stations.<br>
There is a drier (not shown) after each station 32 through 35 so that<br>
the printing and/or coating applied at each station is dried before<br>
the web C reaches the next station and before the web C is wound<br>
into roll 37 or 39.   The station 32 applies the release coating R at<br>
each zone 21T through 29T for each image to be printed with<br>
information.   Alternatively, the entire upper face of the carrier C<br>
can be coated with a continuous uniform release coating R or the<br>
release coating may have been applied to the carrier web C before<br>
the carrier web C is loaded into the equipment 31.   As shown, the<br>
release coating R can be applied at station 32 in the pattern shown<br>
in Fig. 4 at equally spaced intervals.   In particular, the release<br>
coating R is shown to be generally a rectangle which covers all of<br>
zones 21T through 29T.   The station 33 in Fig. 8 applies a protective<br>
coating PC over the release coating R in the pattern as shown in Fig.<br>
4 and as shown in greater detail in Fig. 5.   The station 34 prints the<br>
fixed information shown in Fig. 6 is a first color FC over the fixed-<br><br>
information zones 21T through 28T for each image.   The station 35<br>
prints the fixed information shown in Fig. 7 in a second color SC in<br>
the fixed information zone 29T for each image.   After the carrier web<br>
C has been wound into the roll 37, the carrier web C is rewound to<br>
provide a roll 38 shown in Fig. 9.   For a further pass of the carrier<br>
web C, the stations 32 through 35, or some of them, are set up to add<br>
further desired coatings and/or printing.   As the carrier web C is<br>
unwound from the roll 38 it passes again to the print stations 32<br>
through 35 in succession.   At the station 32 (Fig. 9), a contrasting-<br>
color coating CC can optionally be applied.   If two contrasting-color<br>
coatings CC are to be applied, then the station 33 can be used to<br>
apply a second contrasting-color coating CC.   If only one<br>
contrasting-color coating CC is to be applied, then the station 33 can<br>
be used to apply an adhesive coating A at zones 21T through 29T.   If<br>
the station 33 was used to apply a second contrasting-color coating,<br>
then station 34 will be used to apply the adhesive coating A.   From<br>
there the partially printed thermal transfer web W is wound into a<br>
roll 39.   The coatings and printing that have been applied to the<br>
carrier web C are dry to the touch.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the various layers of coating and/or printing<br>
that have been applied to the partially printed transfer web W,<br>
however, only zones 21T, 24T, 25T, 26T, 27T and 29T are shown.   The<br>
first layer is the film of carrier web C.   The second illustrated layer<br>
is the release coating R.   All the zones 21T through 29T including<br>
illustrated zones 21T, 24T, 25T, 26T, 27T and 29T have layers<br>
comprised by the carrier web C, the release coating R and protective<br>
coating PC. In another layer, the illustrated zones 24T, 25T, 26T and<br><br>
27T as well as the other fixed information zones have printed fixed<br>
information in a first color FC typically black and the zone 21T also<br>
has printed fixed information in a second color SC , for example,<br>
red.   Over the printing FC and SC is at least one layer as shown and<br>
possibly two layers of contrasting-color printing CC in illustrated<br>
zones 21T, 24T, 25T, 26T and 27T as well as the other fixed<br>
information zones.   Over the contrasting-color layers CC in zones<br>
21T through 28T including illustrated zones 21T, 24T, 25T, 26T and<br>
27T and over the protective coating in zone 29T, is the adhesive<br>
coating A.   The thicknesses of the layers have been exaggerated for<br>
clarity.   In reality all of the coatings are thin.   It should be noted<br>
that the pattern of protective coating PC applied over the release<br>
coating R is wider than the printing FC and SC.   This assures that if<br>
the printing is slightly out of registration it will still be aligned<br>
with the protective coating PC.   Next, the profile or pattern of<br>
contrasting-color coating CC should be slightly larger than or<br>
overlap the printing FC and SC, but preferably smaller than the<br>
profile or pattern of the protective coating PC.   The profile or<br>
pattern of the adhesive A is at least slightly larger than the profile<br>
or pattern of the protective coating PC.<br>
The partially printed thermal transfer web W is now ready to<br>
be printed or overprinted with variable information.   With reference<br>
to Fig. 11, the user can use any suitable printer such as a known<br>
printer 42 to print the variable information.   The printer 42, Model<br>
5300ZT-Modified produced by Paxar Americas, Inc., can be provided<br>
with a web WSB and also a second web HSW of hot stamp medium<br>
each one of which is shown to comprise a carrier in the form of a<br><br>
flexible carrier web Cl, a uniform release coating Rl, and a uniform<br>
ink II in a color such as black or if a background color is also to be<br>
printed, a contrasting color such as white.   In instances where only<br>
printing without a contrasting-color background is required, only a<br>
hot stamp medium HSB in one color ink, such as black, is used.   In<br>
instances such as illustrated, a hot stamp medium HSW with ink in a<br>
light color, such as white, is also provided.   The partially printed<br>
web W from a roll 43, which has been rewound from the roll 39, is<br>
passed over a platen 44 of the machine 42, as shown.   A hot stamp<br>
ribbon HSB bearing a dark color ink, e.g., black, is positioned to<br>
advance transversely to the direction of travel of the web W, and<br>
likewise a hot stamp ribbon bearing a light color ink, e.g., white, is<br>
positioned transversely to the direction of travel of the web W.   Hot<br>
stamp print heads 46 and 47 are located opposite the platen 44.   The<br>
print heads 46 and 47 carry replaceable hot stamp plates 48 and 49<br>
or chases with printing type (not shown) which typically bear raised<br>
indicia 50 for printing or more particularly imprinting or hot<br>
stamping variable information onto the web W.   In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the indicia 50 on the plates 48 and 49 are similar<br>
except that the indicia on the plate 49 have a broader profile or<br>
footprint than the indicia 50 on the plate 48, so that the printing<br>
made by the plate 49 overlaps the printing made by the plate 48 to<br>
provide a contrasting-color background.   The web W is brought to<br>
rest while the movable print heads 48 and 49 stamp the variable<br>
information onto the partially printed web W.   Thereafter, the print<br>
heads 46 and 47 move away from the platen 44 to enable the hot<br>
stamp media HSB and HSW to be advanced in the direction of<br><br>
arrows 51.   The print heads 46 and 47 are spaced so that the<br>
variable-information zones 29T of image I and identical image I' are<br>
printed simultaneously.   The print heads 46 and 47 are registered<br>
with adjacent images I and I' and preferably move in unison.   The<br>
spacing of the printing plates 46 and 47 is also the same as the<br>
spacing of registration marks 30.   The variable information of image<br>
I is printed with, e.g. black ink, while the same variable information<br>
of image I' is printed with, e.g., white ink.   It is noted that the W is<br>
advanced stepwise in the direction of arrow 52 following printing.<br>
Image I" has no variable information in zone 29T.   The zones 29T of<br>
images I and I' are printed simultaneously by the print heads 46 and<br>
47 (Fig. 13).   As best shown in Fig. 14, the printed variable<br>
information or indicia 50' printed by the hot stamp medium HSB in<br>
zone 29T is applied over the adhesive A, and has a smaller profile<br>
than the adhesive A; and the contrasting-color 50"printed by hot<br>
stamp medium HSW in zone 29T can have a larger profile than the<br>
printing 50' but a smaller profile than the adhesive A or the<br>
protective coating PC.<br>
The fully printed web W produced by the printer 42 is wound<br>
into a roll 53.   The printed information is dry to the touch.   The web<br>
W can be used directly from the roll 53 to transfer the images one-<br>
by-one onto separate garments, e.g., the garment 54 shown in Fig.<br>
15, or the web W can first be rewound from the roll 53, depending<br>
upon the construction of the transfer machine.   A transfer machine<br>
55, shown diagramatically in slightly exploded form in Fig. 15, has a<br>
platen 56 with a platen surface 57 on which the garment 54 is placed<br>
and with which the garment 54 and the web W are registered.   The<br><br>
fully printed web W with the carrier-web or film side up is passed<br>
between the garment 54 and a heated anvil 58 having a surface 59.<br>
The heated anvil 58 can move toward and away from the platen<br>
surface 57 so that the printed image, which has been registered with<br>
the garment 54, is transferred by heat and pressure from the carrier<br>
web C to the garment 54.   The heat from the platen 58 softens or<br>
melts the release coating R so that the remainder of the coatings and<br>
printing such as PC, FC, SC, A and the printing 50' and 50" made<br>
from ribbons HSB and HSW are transferred onto the garment 54.   In<br>
so doing the adhesive A is activated and becomes tacky and holds or<br>
bonds the transferred coatings and printed information to the<br>
garment 54.   Once applied, the adhesive A is no longer tacky.<br>
Fig. 16 shows an alternative form of thermal transfer medium,<br>
particularly hot stamp medium 60, having a flexible carrier web C,<br>
a uniform release coating R1, a uniform adhesive coating A and a<br>
uniform ink coating 11 which can be used to print variable<br>
information on web W in the variable information zone 29T over the<br>
protective coating PC.   Ink 11 and adhesive A corresponding to the<br>
indicia 50 will be hot stamped over the provisionally applied<br>
protective coating PC.   The resulting layering in the variable-<br>
information zone 29T provides carrier web C, release coating R,<br>
protective coating PC, printing 50' and adhesive A as shown in Fig.<br>
18. Contrasting-color printing 50" also shown in Fig. 18 can be<br>
applied by a thermal transfer hot-stamp ribbon like the ribbon HSW.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 17 there is no coating of adhesive A<br>
on web W in the variable-information zone 29T.   As seen in Fig. 17,<br>
the zone 29T has a layer of a carrier web C, a layer of a release<br><br>
coating R and a layer of a protective coating PC.   When variable<br>
information is printed on the transfer medium web W in the Fig. 17<br>
embodiment by a printer such as in the printer 42, the hot stamp<br>
medium 60 shown in Fig. 16 is used.   Simultaneously adhesive A and<br>
ink II from the hot stamp medium 60 are transferred onto the<br>
protective coating PC in zone 29T by the heated printing plate 48.<br>
In particular, the printing 50' and the adhesive A as shown in Fig.<br>
18, applied simultaneously to the protective coating PC, will<br>
correspond to the indicia 50 on the printing plate or printing type<br>
on the plate 48.   The adhesive A and the printing 50' have the same<br>
profile.   Any printing 50 "has a larger profile than the adhesive A<br>
and printing 50' but a smaller profile than the protective coating PC,<br>
as shown in Fig. 18.   In other respects the completely printed web<br>
W is like the web W.<br>
Fig. 19 shows another alternative form of thermal transfer<br>
medium, particularly a hot stamp medium 60' which can be used to<br>
print variable information in the variable-information zone 29T<br>
directly onto an alternative form of a partially printed release<br>
coated web W" as shown in Fig. 20. In the embodiment of Fig. 20,<br>
there is no coating of adhesive A or protective coating PC in the<br>
variable information zone 29T on the web W".   When the variable<br>
information is printed by the printing plate 48 using the transfer<br>
medium 60', then the protective coating PC, the variable information<br>
printing 50' and the adhesive A are transferred simultaneously<br>
directly onto the release coating R in the configuration of the indicia<br>
50 as shown in Fig. 21.   The adhesive A, the printing 50' and the<br>
protective coating PC have the same profile.   Any printing 50" has a<br><br>
larger profile than the adhesive A, the printing 50' and protective<br>
coating PC as shown in Fig. 21.   In other respects the web W" is like<br>
the web W.<br>
It should be noted that the partially printed web W, W or W"<br>
can be printed with different information simply by inserting into<br>
the printer 42 one or both printing plates 48 and 49 with the desired<br>
indicia.   For example, the plate 48 shown in Fig. 12 can be replaced<br>
by a similar plate bearing indicia X/XL, 46-48 in reverse.   It should<br>
also be noted that when the webs W and W" have transferred<br>
images onto the substrate such as the garment 54, the adhesive A<br>
underlies the printing 50' and any printing 50" so there is no need<br>
for the adhesive A to be clear or transparent enough to enable the<br>
printing 50' to be read, however, if there is any contrasting-color<br>
printing 50" that contrasting-color printing 50" still needs to be seen<br>
so the adhesive A needs to be sufficiently transparent.<br>
It should be noted that the printing of fixed and variable<br>
information can be performed by various printing techniques,<br>
although the printing techniques of screen printing for printing the<br>
fixed information and hot stamp printing for printing the variable<br>
information are preferred.   Other usable techniques include, thermal<br>
transfer printing having a print head with a line of closely spaced<br>
heating elements used with a thermal transfer ribbon, ink jet<br>
printing, flexographic printing, laser printing, and so on.<br>
The ink I1 can have the same characteristics following printing<br>
as the ink in the printed information in zones 21T through 29T<br>
applied by the equipment 31 and likewise the adhesive A applied<br><br>
from ribbons 60, 60" HSB, and HSW can have the same<br>
characteristics as the adhesive A applied by the equipment 31.<br>
When a hot stamp process is used, the ink is embossed or is<br>
driven into the adhesive A to provide hot-stamped embossments in<br>
accordance with the raised indicia 50 on the printing plate 48 so<br>
even if the essentially transparent adhesive A would present a very<br>
slight diminution of visibility or readability of the printing, the hot<br>
stamp process makes the printing even more vibrant and visible than<br>
in the event certain other techniques for printing on the adhesive A<br>
are used.<br>
In the event it is desired to produce a transfer medium web W,<br>
W, or W" with information such as country of origin 23 or material<br>
content 28 in addition to size 29 being variable information, then<br>
zones 23T and/or 28T and 29T can be printed in the printer 42 after<br>
the partially printed transfer medium W, W or W" is produced, and<br>
in that event suitable printing plates tailored to print all such<br>
variable information will be used.<br>
Although coatings R, PC, A are referred to, these coatings can<br>
be and are applied by screen printing and therefore, they can be<br>
considered to be printed.<br>
Other embodiments and modifications of the invention will<br>
suggest themselves to those skilled in the art, and all such of these<br>
