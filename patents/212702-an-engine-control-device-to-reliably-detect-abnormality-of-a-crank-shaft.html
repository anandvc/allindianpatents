				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an engine control device for controlling an engine and, more specifically to an engine control device suitable for controlling an engine provided with a fuel injection device for injecting fuel.<br>
Background Art<br>
With the widespread of fuel injection devices called injector in recent years, control of fuel injection timing and fuel injection amount, namely, the air-fuel ratio has become easy, which makes it possible to improve engine output and fuel consumption and to clean exhaust gas. As to the fuel injection timing, it is common that the phase state of a camshaft, the state of an intake valve, to be exact, is detected, and, based on the detected result, fuel is injected. However, a cam sensor for detecting the phase state of a camshaft, which is expensive and increases the size of a cylinder head, is difficult to be employed in particularly motorcycles. To solve this problem, an engine control device adapted to detect the phase state of a crankshaft and an intake air pressure and, based on those, to detect the stroke state of a cylinder is proposed in JP-A-H10-227252. With this prior art, it is possible to detect the stroke state of a cylinder without detecting the phase of a camshaft, so that it is possible to control fuel injection timing based on the stroke state.<br>
For example, the phase of a crankshaft is detected as follows. The crankshaft or a member which is rotated in synchronization with the crankshaft has teeth formed on an outer periphery thereof at equal intervals with an irregular interval part and crank pulses are generated by crank pulse generating means such as a magnetic sensor along with the rotational movement of the teeth. A specific<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
rotational position of the crankshaft corresponding the irregular interval part of the teeth is detected based on the state of the crank pulses, and the rotational angle, namely the phrase, of the crankshaft can be detected based on, for example, the number of the crank pulses from the specific rotational position of the crankshaft. However, when the positional relation between the crank pulse generating means such as a magnetic sensor and the teeth is not appropriate, the crank pulses may not be properly generated. Crank pulses generated by crank pulse generating means such as a magnetic sensor are obtained by binarizing a current continuously varying as a sine curve into ON-OFF signals with a prescribed value. Thus, when the sensor is too close to the teeth, the pulses become long or no OFF—part is generated, ad when the sensor is too apart from the teeth, the pulses become shart or no ON-part is generated. In addition, there is conventionally no specific method for detecting an abnormal condition of the crank pulse generating means.<br>

The  present  invention  hat been made to solve  the  above problems and it is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an engine control device which can reliably detect  an abnormal condition of crank pulse generating means.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Description will be herein after made of the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of an engine<br>
-4-<br><br>
for a motorcycle or the like and a control device therefor. Designated as 1 is a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine. The engine 1 has a cylinder body 2, a crankshaft 3, a piston 4, a combustion chamber 5, an intake pipe 6, an intake valve 7, an exhaust pipe 8, an exhaust valve 9, a spark plug 10, and an ignition coil 11. In the intake pipe 6, a throttle valve 12 which is opened and closed in accordance with accelerator opening is provided and an injector 13 as a fuel injection device is disposed downstream of the throttle valve 12. The injector 13 is connected to a filter 18, a fuel pump 17 and a pressure control valve 16 which are housed in a fuel tank 19. The engine 1 employs an independent suction system, so that the injector 13 is provided in each intake pipe 6 of each cylinder.<br>
The operating condition of the engine 1 is controlled by an engine control unit 15. As means for performing control input into the engine control unit 15, namely means for detecting the operating condition of the engine 1, there are provided a crank angle sensor 20 as crank pulse generating means for generating crank pulses for use in detecting the rotational angle, namely phase, of the crankshaft 3, a cooling water temperature sensor 21 for detecting the temperature of the cylinder body 2 or cooling water, namely the temperature of the engine body, an exhaust air-fuel ratio sensor 22 for detecting the air-fuel ratio in the exhaust pipe 8, an intake air pressure sensor 24 for detecting the pressure of intake air in the intake pipe 6, and an intake air temperature sensor 25 for detecting the temperature in the intake pipe 6, namely the temperature of intake air. The engine control unit 15 receives detecting signals from the sensors and outputs control signals to the fuel pump 17, the pressure control valve 16, the injector 13 and the ignition coil 11.<br>
Here, the principle of crank angle signals which are outputted from the crank angle sensor 20 will be described. In this embodiment, a plurality of teeth 23 are formed on an outer periphery of the crankshaft 3 at generally equal intervals as shown in FIG. 2a. The crank angle sensor 20, such as a magnetic sensor, detects the approach of the teeth 23, and the resulting current is electrically processed,<br>
-5-<br><br>
namely binarized with a prescribed value, and outputted as pulse signals. The circumferential pitch between two adjacent teeth 23 is 30° in the phase (rotational angle) of the crankshaft 3, and the circumferential width of each of the teeth 23 is 10° in the phase (rotational angle) of the crankshaft 3. There is a part where two adjacent teeth are arranged not at the above pitch but at a pitch which is twice as large as the others. It is a special part where there is no tooth where there should be one as shown by double-dot-dash lines in FIG. 2a.  This part corresponds to the irregular interval part, namely the specific rotational position. This part may be hereinafter also referred to as "tooth missing part". Thus, when the crankshaft 3 is rotating at a constant speed, the train of pulse signals corresponding to the teeth 23 appears as shown in FIG. 2b.  FIG. 2a shows the state where the cylinder is at compression top dead center (the state is the same when the cylinder is at exhaust top dead center) . The pulse signal output immediately before the cylinder reaches compression top dead center is numbered as "0", and the following pulse signals are numbered as "1", "2", "3" and "4". The tooth missing part, which comes after the tooth 23 corresponding to the pulse signal "4", is counted as one tooth as if there were one there, and the pulse signal corresponding to the next tooth 23 is numbered as "6". When this process is continued, the tooth missing part comes again after a pulse signal "16". The tooth missing part is again counted as one tooth as above, and the pulse signal corresponding to the next tooth 23 is numbered as "18". When the crankshaft 3 rotates twice, the four strokes of one cycle complete, so that the pulse signal corresponding to the next tooth 23 which appears after the pulse signal "23" is numbered as "0" again. In principle, the cylinder reaches compression top dead center immediately after the pulse signals numbered as "0" appear. The thus detected pulse signal train or each pulse signal is defined as "crank pulse". When stroke detection is performed based on the crank pulse as described later, crank timing can be detected. The teeth 23 may be formed on an outer periphery of a member which is rotated in synchronization with the crankshaft 3.<br>

The engine control unit 15 is constituted of a microcomputer {not shown) and so on.      FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the engine control operation performed by the microcomputer in the engine control unit 15. The engine control operation is performed by an engine rotational speed calculating part 26 for calculating the engine rotational speed based on a crank angle signal, a crank timing detecting part 27 for detecting crank timing information, namely the stroke state, based on the crank angle signal and an intake air pressure signal, an intake air amount calculating part 28 for calculating the amount of intake air based on the crank timing information detected by the crank timing detecting part 27 together with an intake air temperature signal and the intake air pressure signal, a fuel injection amount setting part 29 for setting a target air-fuel ratio based on the engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 and the intake air amount calculated in the intake air amount calculating part 28 and detecting an accelerating state to calculate and set a fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing, an injection pulse output part 30 for outputting injection pulses corresponding to the fuel injection amount and the fuel injection timing set by the fuel injection amount setting part 29 to the injector 13 based on the crank timing information detected by the crank timing detecting part 27, an ignition timing setting part 31 for setting ignition timing based on the crank timing information detected by the crank timing detecting part 27 together with the engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 and the fuel injection amount set by the fuel injection amount setting part 29, and an ignition pulse output part 32 for outputting ignition pulses corresponding to the ignition timing set by the ignition timing setting part 31 to the ignition coil 11 based on the crank timing information detected by the crank timing information detecting part 27.<br>
The engine rotational speed calculating part 26 calculates the rotational speed of the crankshaft as an output shaft of the engine as the engine rotational speed based on the rate of change of the<br>
-7-<br><br>
crank angle signal with time. More specifically, the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 calculates an instantaneous value of the engine rotational speed by dividing the phase between two adjacent teeth 23 by time needed to detect corresponding crank pulses and an average engine rotational speed that is an average movement distance of the teeth 23.<br>
The crank timing detecting part 27, which has a constitution similar to the stroke judging device disclosed in JP-A-H10-227252, detects the stroke state of each cylinder as shown in FIG. 4, for example, and outputs it as crank timing information. Namely, in a four-cycle engine, the crankshaft and the camshaft are constantly rotated with a prescribed phase difference, so that when crank pulses are read as shown in FIG. 4, the fourth crank pulse after the tooth missing part, namely the crank pulse "9" or "21" represents either an exhaust stroke or a compression stroke. As is well known, during an exhaust stroke, the exhaust valve is opened and the intake valve is closed, so that the intake air pressure is high. However, in an early stage of a compression stroke, the intake air pressure is low because the intake valve is still open or because of the previous intake stroke even if the intake valve is closed. Thus, the crank pulse "21" output when the intake air pressure is low indicates that the cylinder is on a compression stroke, and the cylinder reaches compression top dead center immediately after the crank pulse "0" is obtained. When a stroke state can be detected as above, the present stroke state can be detected in further detail by interpolating the intervals between the pulses with the rotational speed of the crankshaft. Also, when the stroke state of one of the cylinders can be detected, the stroke state of the other cylinders can be judged since there are prescribed phase differences between the strokes of the cylinders.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the intake air amount calculating part 28 comprises an intake air pressure detecting part 281 for detecting an intake air pressure based on an intake air pressure signal and crank timing information, a mass flow rate map storing part 282 in which a map for use in detecting a mass flow rate of intake air based<br>
-8-<br><br>
on the intake air pressure is stored, a mass flow rate calculating part 283 for calculating a mass flow rate corresponding to the detected intake air pressure using the mass flow rate map, an intake air temperature detecting part 284 for detecting the intake air temperature of based on an intake air temperature signal, and a mass flow rate correction part 285 for correcting the mass flow rate of intake air based on the mass flow rate of intake air calculated in the mass flow rate calculating part 283 and the intake air temperature detected by the intake air temperature detecting part 284. Since the mass flow rate map is organized based on a mass flow rate at an intake air temperature of 20°C, the map is corrected with an actual intake air temperature (absolute temperature ratio) to calculate the intake air amount.<br>
In this embodiment, the intake air amount is calculated using an intake air pressure measured between the moment when the cylinder reaches compression bottom dead center and the moment when the intake valve is closed. When the intake valve is opened, the intake air pressure and the pressure in the cylinder become almost the same. Thus, the air mass in the cylinder can be obtained from the intake air pressure, the volume in the cylinder and the intake air temperature. However, since the intake valve is open for a while after a compression stroke started and air can travel between the cylinder and the intake pipe during that time, the intake air amount calculated from an intake air pressure measured before the cylinder reaches bottom dead center may differ from the air amount actually sucked into the cylinder. Thus the intake air amount is calculated using an intake air pressure measured while air cannot travel between the cylinder and the intake pipe although the intake valve is open in a compression stroke. For further accuracy, the effect of the partial pressure of combusted gas may be taken into consideration. Namely, since the partial pressure of combusted gas has close correlation with the engine rotational speed, the intake air amount may be subjected to correction obtained in an experiment based on the engine rotational speed.<br>
In this embodiment employing an independent suction system, a map,<br>
-9-<br><br>
in Which the mass flow rate has a relatively linear relation with the intake air pressure as shown in FIG. 6, is used as the mass flow rate map for use in calculating the intake air amount. This is because the air mass is obtained based on the Boyle-Charles law (PV = nRT). When the intake pipes of the cylinders are connected, a map shown by a broken line in FIG. 6 must be used since the premise "intake<br>
air pressure = pressure in the cylinder" does not hold because of the effect of the pressures in the other cylinders.<br>
The fuel injection amount setting part 29 has a steady state target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33 for calculating a target air-fuel ratio in a steady state based on an engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 and an intake air pressure signal, a steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34 for calculating a fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing in the steady state based on the steady state target air-fuel ratio calculated in the steady state target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33 and the intake air amount calculated in the intake air amount calculating part 28, a fuel behavior model 35 for use in calculating a fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing in a steady state in the steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34, accelerating state detecting means 41 for detecting an accelerating state based on a crank angle signal, an intake air pressure signal and crank timing information detected by the crank timing detecting part 27, and an accelerating time fuel injection amount calculating part 42 for calculating a fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing in an accelerating time based on the engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 in response to detection of an accelerating state by the accelerating state detecting means 41. The fuel behavior model 35 is substantially integrated with the steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34. Namely, without the fuel behavior model 35, it is impossible to calculate and set a fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing accurately in this embodiment, in which fuel is injected into the intake pipe. The fuel behavior model 35 requires an intake air temperature signal, an<br>
-10-<br><br>
engine rotational speed and a cooling water temperature signal.<br>
The steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34 and the fuel behavior model 35 are constituted as shown in a block diagram in FIG. 7. Letting MF-TNT be the amount of fuel injected from the injector 13 into the intake pipe 6 and X be the rate of the amount of fuel which adheres to the wall of the intake pipe 6 to the fuel injection amount MF-INJ, the amount of fuel injected directly into the cylinder out of the fuel injection amount MF-INJ is ((1 - X) x MF-INJ) and the amount of fuel which adheres to the intake pipe wall is (X x MF-INJ). Some of the fuel which adheres to the intake pipe wall flows along the intake pipe wall into the cylinder. Letting MF-BUF be the amount of fuel which remains on the intake pipe wall and the rate of the amount of fuel which is taken away by an air flow to the fuel remaining amount MF-BUF be ?, the amount of fuel which is taken away and flows into the cylinder is (t x MF-BUF).<br>
In the steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34, a cooling water correction coefficient KW is calculated from the cooling water temperature Tw using a cooling water temperature correction coefficient table. The intake air amount MA-MAN is subjected to a fuel cut routine for cutting fuel when the throttle opening is 0, then is corrected with a flow-in air temperature TA to obtain an air flow-in amount MA. The air flow-in amount MA is multiplied by the reciprocal of the target air-fuel ratio AFo, then the result is multiplied by the cooling water temperature correction coefficient KW to obtain a required fuel flow-in amount MF. Also, the fuel adhesion rate X is obtained from the engine rotational speed NE and the intake air pressure PA-MAN using a fuel adhesion rate map, and the taking-away rate t is obtained from the engine rotational speed NE and the intake air pressure PA-MAN using a taking-away rate map. Then, a fuel remaining amount MF-BUF obtained in the previous calculation is multiplied by the taking-away rate t to obtain a fuel taken-away amount MF-TA, and a fuel direct flow-in amount MF-DIR is calculated by subtracting the fuel taken-away amount MF-TA from the required fuel flow-in amount MF. As described before, since the fuel direct flow-in amount MF-DIR is (1 - X) times the fuel injection amount<br>
-11 -<br><br>
MF-INJ, the fuel direct flow-in amount MF-DIR is divided by (1 - X) to obtain a steady state fuel injection amount MF-INJ. Since ((1 -?) X MF-BUF) amount of the fuel left in the intake pipe up to the last time still remains this time, the fuel remaining amount MF-BUF of this time is obtained by adding the fuel adhesion amount (X x MF-INJ) thereto.<br>
Since the intake air amount calculated in the intake air amount calculating part 28 has been detected in the final stage of the intake stroke or the early stage of the following compression stroke of the previous cycle prior to the present cycle, in which an explosion (expansion) stroke is about to start, the steady state fuel injection amount and fuel injection timing calculated and set by the steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34 is based on the amount of intake air sucked during the previous cycle.<br>
The accelerating state detecting part 41 has an accelerating state threshold value table. The threshold value, which is for use in detecting an accelerating state by comparing the difference between the present intake air pressure and the intake air pressure at the same crank angle in the same stroke as present- more specifically an intake or exhaust stroke, in the previous cycle with a prescribed value, varies according to the crank angle. Thus, the detection of an accelerating state is performed by comparing the difference between the present and previous intake air pressures with a prescribed value which varies according to the crank angle. The detection of an accelerating state is performed after a prescribed number of cycles have been completed since the previous accelerating state is detected.<br>
The accelerating time fuel injection amount calculating part 42 calculates an accelerating time fuel injection amount MF-ACC from a three-dimensional map based on the difference between the present and previous intake air pressures and the engine rotational speed NE when the accelerating state detecting part 41 detects an accelerating state. In this embodiment, the accelerating fuel injection timing is when the accelerating state detecting part 41 detects an accelerating state. Namely, the accelerating time fuel<br>
-12-<br><br>
injection amount MF-ACC of fuel is injected immediately after an accelerating state was detected.<br>
The ignition timing setting part 31 comprises a basic ignition timing calculating part 36 for calculating basic ignition timing based on an engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 and a target air-fuel ratio calculated in the target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33, and an ignition timing correction part 38 for correcting the basic ignition timing calculated in the basic ignition timing calculating part 36 based on an accelerating time fuel injection amount calculated in the accelerating time fuel injection amount calculating part 42.<br>
The basic ignition timing calculating part 36 obtains the ignition timing when the maximum torque can be generated at the engine rotational speed and the target air-fuel ratio at present by retrieving a map as basic ignition timing. The basic ignition timing calculated in the basic ignition timing calculating part 36 is based on the result of the intake stroke of the previous cycle as in the case with the steady state fuel injection amount calculated in the steady state fuel injection amount calculating part 34. The ignition timing correction part 38 obtains the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder at the time when an accelerating time fuel injection amount calculated in the accelerating time fuel injection amount calculating part 42 will be added to the steady state fuel injection amount in response to the calculation of an accelerating time fuel injection amount in the accelerating time fuel injection amount calculating part 42. Then, when the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder largely differs from the target air-fuel ratio calculated in the steady state target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33, the ignition timing correction part 38 corrects ignition timing by setting new ignition timing using the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder, the engine rotational speed and the intake air pressure.<br>
As described above, the engine control device of the present invention can control the operating condition of the engine using<br>
-13-<br><br>
intake air pressures and crank pulses without a cam sensor and a throttle sensor. The crank angle sensor 20 as crank pulse generating means constituted of a magnetic sensor or the like detects the approach of the teeth 23 as variation in current. Thus, when the crank angle sensor 20 is close to the teeth 23, the current value becomes large, and when the crank angle sensor 20 is apart from the teeth 23, the current value becomes small. When the current value is binarized with a prescribed value, the crank pulses may be long or no OFF-part may be generated when the current value is large and the crank pulses may be short or no ON-part may be generated when the current value is small. Such a defect is caused by the orientation of the crank angle sensor and the accuracy of the teeth as well as the relative position of the crank angle sensor to the teeth.<br>
In this embodiment, an irregular interval part (which may be hereinafter referred to as "irregular pitch") corresponding to the tooth missing part and a regular interval part (which may be hereinafter referred to as "regular pitch") are detected as follows. As shown in FIG. 8, a crank pulse ratio I is calculated by dividing the width T2 of an OFF-part by the sum of the width T1 of a crank pulse before the OFF-part and the width T3 of a crank pulse after the OFF-part (the width T1 to T3 are represented by time). Then, When the crank pulse ratio I is smaller than a prescribed value a, the part is regarded as a regular pitch and when the crank pulse ratio I is larger than a prescribed value a, the part is regarded as an irregular pitch. The judging method can reliably detect an irregular pitch and a regular pitch even when the rotational speed of the crankshaft, namely the engine rotational speed varies but cannot when the crank pulses are loner or short as described before. Thus, the engine control unit 15 detects abnormality in crank pulses according to the operation shown in FIG. 9. The operation is performed as an interrupt process when each crank pulse falls after the input of the crank pulse, for example. Although there is provided no step for communication in this operation, information necessary for the operation is read as needed and the results of<br>
-14-<br><br>
the operation are stored as needed.<br>
At first in this operation, a crank pulse ratio I is calculated in the step S1.<br>
Then, the process goes to the step S2, where it is judged whether the crank pulse ratio I calculated in the step 1 is greater than a prescribed value or, namely whether the part is an irregular pitch. When it is the tooth missing part, the process goes to the step S3. Otherwise, the process goes to the step S4.<br>
In the step S3, it is judged whether a crank pulse counter T is not at a prescribed value To. If the crank pulse counter T is not at the prescribed value To, the process goes to the step S5. Otherwise, the process goes to the step S6.<br>
In the step S5, an interval abnormality counter CNT is incremented. Then, the process goes to the step S7.<br>
In the step S7, the crank pulse counter T is cleared to "0". Then, the process goes to the step S8.<br>
In the step S8, it is judged whether the interval abnormality counter CNT is at a value which is not smaller than a prescribed value CNTo. If the interval abnormality counter CNT is at a value which is not smaller than the prescribed value CNTo, the process goes to the step S9. Otherwise, the process returns to a main program.<br>
In step S6, the interval abnormality counter CNT is cleared to "0". Then, the process goes to the step S10.<br>
In the step S10, the crank pulse counter T is cleared to "0". Then, the process returns to the main program.<br>
In the step S4, the crank pulse counter T is incremented. Then, the process goes to the step S11.<br>
In the step S11, it is judged whether the crank pulse counter T is at a value which is not smaller than a count-up value TMAX. If the crank pulse counter T is at a value which is not smaller than the count-up value TMAX, the process goes to the step S9. Otherwise, the process goes to the step S12.<br>
In the step S12, it is judged whether a predetermined prescribed number or more of crank pulses cannot be detected within a predetermined prescribed period of time. If the prescribed number<br>
- 15-<br><br>
or more of crank pulses cannot be detected within the prescribed period of time, the process goes to the step S13. Otherwise the process goes to the step S14.<br>
In the step S13, a crank pulse undetectable counter K is incremented. Then, the process goes to the step S15.<br>
In the step S15, it is judged whether the crank pulse undetectable counter K is at a value which is not smaller than a count-up value KMAX. If the crank pulse undetectable counter K is at a value which is not smaller than the count-up value KMAX, the process goes to the step S9. Otherwise, the process returns to the main program.<br>
In the step S14, the crank pulse undetectable counter K is cleared to "0". Then, the process returns to the main program.<br>
In the step S9, it is determined that there is an abnormality in crank pulses and a prescribed fail safe process is performed. Then, the operation is ended. Examples of the fuel safe process include gradually lowering the engine torque by decreasing the frequency of ignition gradually in each cylinder, shifting the ignition in each cylinder to the lag side gradually, or closing the throttle quickly at first and then slowly and an indication of abnormality.<br>
According to the operation, when the situation in which the crank pulse counter T, which is incremented in response to regular pitch crank pulses, does not reach the prescribed value To before an irregular pitch, namely a specific rotational position of the crankshaft, is detected since a previous irregular pitch was detected repeatedly occurs at least a prescribed value CNTo times, it is determined that there is an abnormality in crank pulses and a fail safe process as described before is performed. When the crank pulse counter T, which is incremented in response to regular pitch crank pulses, reaches the count-up value TMAX or greater, in other words, an irregular pitch is not detected for a prescribed period of time for the counter to count up to TMAX, it is judged that there is an abnormality in crank pulses and a fail safe process as described before is performed. Also, when the situation in which a prescribed number or more of clank pulses are not detected for a prescribed period of time repeatedly occurs at least the count-up value KMAX<br>
-16-<br><br>
of times, it is judged that there is an abnormality in crank pulses and a fail safe process as described before is performed.<br>
In this embodiment, the correct number of crank pulses between irregular pitches is "11" as shown in FIG. 10a. However, there may occur a situation in which no irregular pitch can be detected as shown in FIG. 10b (the crank angle sensor is too close to the teeth) or a situation in which the number of crank pulses between irregular pitches are not "11" as shown in FIG. 10c (the crank angle sensor is too far from the teeth) . According to the operation shown in FIG. 9, both of the situations can be detected as an abnormality in crank pulses. In addition, when a prescribed number or more of crank pulses cannot be detected for a prescribed period of time although crank pulses can be detected such as when the engine is being started with a kick starter, or such a situation repeatedly occurs at least the count-up value KMAX of times, namely, when the engine does not start to rotate, a fail safe process can be performed (even if the cause is not derived from crank pulses).<br>
In the above embodiment, description has been made of an engine of the type in which fuel is injected into an intake pipe but the engine control device of the present invention is applicable to an in-cylinder injection engine, namely, direct injection engine. In a direct injection engine, however, adhesion of fuel to the intake pipe does not occur, so that it is not necessary to take it into consideration and a total amount of fuel to be injected can be used in calculation of an air-fuel ratio.<br>
Also in the above embodiment, description has been made of a multi-cylinder engine having four cylinders but the engine control device of the present invention is applicable to a single-cylinder engine.<br>
The engine control unit may be an operation circuit instead of the microcomputer.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As has been described above, according to the engine control device of Claim 1 of the present invention, it is determined that the crank<br>
- 17-<br><br>
pulse generating means is in an abnormal condition when at least one crank pulse has been detected and a specific rotational position of the crankshaft is not detected for a prescribed period of time or longer. Thus, an abnormal situation in which the crank pulse generating means constituted of a magnetic sensor or the like is too close to the teeth can be reliably detected.<br>
According to the engine control device of Claim 2 of the present invention, it is determined that the crank pulse generating means is in an abnormal condition when the number of crank pulses detected while a specific rotational position of the crankshaft is detected twice is not equal to a prescribed value. Thus, an abnormal situation in which the crank pulse generating means constituted of a magnetic sensor or the like is too apart from to the teeth can be reliably detected.<br>
As has been described above, according to the engine control device of Claim 3 of the present invention, it is determined that the crank pulse generating means is in an abnormal condition when at least one crank pulse is detected and a prescribed number or more of crank pulses are not detected for a prescribed period of time. Thus, an abnormal situation in which crank pulses are not properly generated when, for example, the engine is being started with a kick starter can be reliably detected.<br>
-18-<br><br>

19<br><br>
intake  air pressure detecting means for detecting  the<br>
intake air  pressure in an intake pipe of an engine,<br>
engine control means for controlling the operating condition of said engine based on the phase of the crankshaft judged by said crankshaft phase detecting means and the intake air pressure detected by said intake air pressure detecting means, and<br>
crank pulse abnormality detecting means for determining whether said crank pulse generating means is at an abnormal position when the irregular pitch is not detected for a prescribed period of time or for a period beyond said prescribed period of time inspite of being detected by said crankshaft phase detecting means.<br>
20<br><br>
2.     The engine control device  as claimed in claim 1,<br>
21<br>
wherein the crank pulse abnormality detecting means confirms an abnormal position  of the crank pulse generating means when the number of crank pulses detected in  two phases is not equal to a prescribed value  Inspite of the crankshaft phase detecting means  detecting the irregular pitch.<br>
The invention relates to an engine controller (13) in which abnormality of a crankshaft (3) due to the fixing accuracy of a crank angle sensor (20), can be detected surely. A decision is made that a crank pulse is abnormal when a state where a crank pulse container T at a normal pitch does not have a specified<br>
value To   during  an  interval of  detecting  an  unequal  pitch<br>
(interval  abnormality)  is repeated a specified  value  CNTo   or more,  or  the  time  during which an  unequal  pitch  cannot  be detected continues not shorter than the count up value TMAX  of the  crank pulse counter T, or a state where a crank pulse  of  a specified value or above cannot be detected within a speclied  time<br>
in repeated a count up value KMAX or more.</td>
