entitled "SPECULATIVE DISTRIBUTED CONFLICT RESOLUTION FOR A CACHE COHERENCY PROTOCOL"<br>
FIELD   The invention relates to cache memories. More particularly, the invention relates to distributed conflict resolution in a multi-cache multiprocessor system.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
   When an electronic system includes multiple cache memories, the validity of the data available for use must be maintained. This is typically accomplished by manipulating data according to a cache coherency protocol. As the number of caches and/or processors increases, the complexity of maintaining cache coherency also increases.<br>
    When multiple components (e.g., a cache memory, a processor) request the same block of data the conflict between the multiple components must be resolved in a, manner that maintains the validity of the data. Current cache coherency protocols typically have a single component that is responsible for conflict resolution. However, as the complexity of the system increases reliance on a single component for conflict resolution can decrease overall system performance.<br>
Figures la through le provide a conceptual illustration of a conflict condition in a mu^ti-node system. Nodes 110, 120 and 130 are peer nodes that can store a copy of the requested data (e.g., a cache line) in cache memory. Home node 140 is the Home (H) node for the requested data. In the example of Figures la through ! e, peer nodes 110 and 120 store an invalid copy, or no copy, of the requested data and peer node 130 stores a modified copy of the requested data that has not been written back to memory. The Home node stores the original copy of the data in memory or modified versions of the data when the modifications are written back to memory.<br>
[0005]        As illustrated in Figure la, peer node 120 transmits a Data Request message to request a copy of a block of data, for example, a cache line. The Data Request message is transmitted to peer node 110 and to peer node 130. However, the Data<br>
Request message to peer node 130 is delayed. The delay can be caused, for example, by<br>
lack of available bandwidth, buffering considerations, etc.<br>
[0006]        Peer node 110 responds to the Data Request message from peer node 120 with<br>
a No Valid Copy message, which indicates to peer node 120 that peer node 110 does not<br>
have a valid copy of the requested data. At some time after peer node 120 transmits Data<br>
Request messages, Peer node 110 transmits Data Request messages to peer nodes 120<br>
and 130, as illustrated in Figure 1c, requesting the same data as was requested by peer<br>
node 120.<br>
[0007]        Peer node 120 provides a No Valid Copy message to peer node 110 in<br>
response to the Data Request message. Peer node 130 provides the requested data to peer<br>
node 110. The copy of the data, if any, maintained by peer node 130 is marked invalid<br>
and the copy of the data stored by peer node 110 is marked Modified.<br>
[0008]       At some time after peer node 130 has responded to the Data Request from<br>
peer node 110 and invalidated the copy of the data, peer node 130 receives the delayed<br>
Data Request message from peer node 120, as illustrated in Figure lc. In response to the<br>
Data Request message, peer node 130 provides a No Valid Copy message to peer node<br>
120. Note that the state of the data stored by peer node 130 changed from the time of the<br>
original Data Request message to the time the peer node 130 responds to the Data<br>
Request message.<br>
[0009]        Because peer nodes 110 and 130 respond to the Data Request message from<br>
peer node 120 with No Valid Copy messages, peer node 120, finding no valid cached<br>
copy of the requested data, requests a copy of the data from home node 140. Thus, as<br>
illustrated in Figure Id, peer node transmits a Read message to home node 140. Home<br>
node 140 retrieves the requested data from memory and provides the data to peer node 120. Peer node 120 then stores the requested data in the Exclusive state. [0010]        As illustrated in Figure le, the sequence of messages illustrated in Figures la through le result in two incompatible copies of a data line. In the example provided peer node 110 stores a copy of the data in the Modified state and peer node 120 stores a copy of the data in the Exclusive state. However, the copy stored by peer node 120 is not exclusive to peer node 120. Thus, multi-node systems can result in incompatible copies of data under certain circumstances unless a mechanism is provided to resolve cache conflicts. <br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a system comprising: a plurality of peer nodes having cache memories to generate requests for data, the peer node having a valid, cached copy of the requested data to resolve the conflicting requests and to provide a copy of the requested data to one of the multiple requesting peer nodes; and a home node corresponding to the requested data coupled with the peer nodes, the home node to resolve the conflicting requests if no peer node stores a valid, cached copy of the requested data..<br>
The present invention also relates to a system, comprising: a memory to store original and written-back copies of data corresporfding to a predetermined range of addresses;<br>
a cache memory to store copies of requested blocks of data; and<br>
a control circuit coupled with the memory and with the cache memory to receive, from a peer node, a message having a request for a copy of a block of data stored in the memory and a list of nodes, if any, having issued conflicting request messages, the control circuit to provide a copy of the requested data to the requesting peer node, the control circuit further to receive a subsequent, conflicting request form a node from the list, and to send a message to the previous requesting node to send a copy of the requested data to the subsequently requesting node.<br>
The invention also relates to a system, comprising: means for receiving, from a peer node, a message having a request for a copy of a block of data stored in the memory and a list of nodes, if any, having issued conflicting request messages;<br>
means for providing a copy of the requested data to the requesting peer node; means for receiving a subsequent, conflicting request for a node from the list; and means for sending a message to the previous requesting node to send a copy of the requested data to the subsequently requesting node.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011]]       Techniques for piggybacking multiple cache protocol messages into a single message packet are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention.<br>
Request Messages<br>
{0012]        The following messages are requests for data/action from a requesting node.<br>
These messages are broadcast to all nodes of the system.<br>
Port Read Line (PRL): This is a request for a copy of a data segment such as, for example, a cache line. ,<br>
Port Read Invalidate Line (PRIL): This is a request for a copy of a data segment where the provider node's copy ot the data is invalidated. This message can also be referred to as a "request for ownership."<br>
Port Write Line (PVVL): This message causes data (e.g., a modified cache line) to be written to memory. This message can also referred to as a "dirty eviction."<br>
Port Invalidate Line (PIL): This message causes the state of designated data to change from Shared to Exclusive.<br>
Port Write Invalidate Line (PWIL)-: This message causes data to be written to memory and the target copy of the data to be invalidated.<br>
Response Messages<br>
[0013]       The following messages are messages from sent from Peer (i.e., Non-Home)<br>
nodes to the Requesting node in response to requests described above.<br>
Invalid State Acknowledgement (IACK): This message is a response to a request (PRL, PRIL, PIL, PVVIL) when the node sending the response has an invalid copy of the requested data or no copy of the requested data.<br>
Shared State Acknowledgement (SACK): This message is a response to a PRL request when the node sending the response has a copy of the requested data in the Shared state.<br>
Acknowledgement of Data Received (DACK): This message acknowledges the receipt of requested data. This node is sent by the home node when the home node receives a CNCL message. The target node for the DACK message is the forwarding node included in the CNCL message. A node receiving the transferred data or memory data from the home node does not respond to the sending node.<br>
Conflict: ..This message indicates that there is a copending request for the reouested cache line<br>
Data(Conflicts): This message is used to forward data and lists conflicts, if any. The conflict list is empty when data is forwarded or when the home node sends memory data to the first owner. When data is transferred, the sending node attaches a list of conflicts. The receiving node uses the list to send CNFL responses to matching requests stored in a buffer.<br>
Messages to Home Node<br>
[0014]       These messages are transmitted to the Home node by a Peer node.<br>
Read(Conflicts): This message requests data from the Home node and lists conflicts, if any. This message is sent after all responses are received by a peer node if none of the received messages were a DATA message.<br>
CNCL(Conflicts): This message is sent to the Home node in response to a hit in a Peer node and lists all conflicts, if any. This message cancels the Home node's prefetch operation.<br>
Messages From the Home Node<br>
[0015]        These messages are sent from the Home node to the Peer and/or Requesting<br>
nodes.<br>
Data: This message includes the requested data and can indicate the state of the data (M/E/F) to be used by the Requesting node.<br>
Acknowledge (ACK): This message indicates that the requested data has been sent to the Requesting node. When the home node sends an ACK message, the current epoch is terminated.<br>
Transfer (XFR): This message causes the receiving node to transfer data to the node indicated in the message. The home node sends this message to the current owner of requested data when the home node is informed of a conflict condition requiring that the current owner of the data transfer the data to the target node. A XFRI message is sent instead of a XFR message if the home node determines that an unresolved conflicting request is a PRIL or PWIL message, meaning that the current owner must invalidate the line when initiating the data<br>
transfer. In one embodiment, the first node in an epoch to send a CNCL message is the current owner. An epoch is the period between a first request for data and the resolution of all conflicting requests for the data. If the home node sends data to a node from memory, that node is the current owner. Sending a XFR/XFRI message causes the target node to become the current owner. In one embodiment, the target node is selected from a list of conflicts provided to the home node in a READ or a CNCL message. Target nodes are selected from nodes from which the home node has received a READ message. Thus, if the home node has A as the current owner of a cache line because A sent the home node a CNCL(B,C), the home node waits until a READ message comes from B or C to send a XFR/XFRI message to A to cause A to forward the data to the node (B or C) that sent the READ message. The home node then waits for the third node to sent a READ message before sending a XFR/XFRI message causing the data to be sent to the third node.<br>
Overview of the MESIF Protocol<br>
[0016]       There are two basic schemes for providing cache coherence, snooping (now<br>
often called Symmetric Multiprocessing SMP) and directories (often called Distributed<br>
Shared Memory DSM). The fundamental difference has to do with placement and access<br>
to the meta-information, that is, the information about where copies of a cache line are<br>
stored.<br>
[0017]        For snooping caches the information is distributed with the cached copies<br>
themselves, that is, each valid copy of a cache line is head by a unit that must recognize<br>
its responsibility whenever any node requests permission to access the cache line in a<br><br>
new way. Someplace—usually at a fixed location—is a repository where the data is stored when it is uncached. This location may contain a valid copy even when the line is cached. However, the location of this node is generally unknown to requesting nodes— the requesting nodes simply broadcast the address of a requested cache line, along with permissions needed, and all nodes that might have a copy must respond to assure that consistency is maintained, with the node containing the uncached copy responding if no other (peer) node responds.<br>
{0018|        For directory-based schemes, in addition to a fixed place where the uncached data is stored, there is a fixed location, the directory, indicating where cached copies reside. In order to access a cache line in a new way, a node must communicate with the node containing the directory, which is usually the same node containing the uncached data repository, thus allowing the responding node to provide the data when the main storage copy is valid. Such a node is referred to as the Home node. [0019]       The directory may be distributed in two ways. First, main storage data (the uncached repository) is often distributed among nodes, with the directory distributed in the same way. Secondly, the meta-information itself may be distributed, keeping at the Home node as little information as whether the line is cached, and if so, where a single copy resides.<br>
[0020]       Snooping schemes rely on broadcast, because there is no single place where the meta-information is held, so all nodes must be notified of each query, each node being responsible for doing its part to assure that coherence is maintained. This includes intervention messages, informing the Home node not to respond when another node is providing the data.<br>
[0021]        Snooping schemes have the advantage that responses can be direct and quick, but do not scale well because all nodes are required to observe all queries. Directory schemes are more scalable, but require more complex responses, often involving three nodes in point-to-point communications.<br>
(0022]       The basic MESIF protocol described herein provides a snooping-like protocol without the limitations of a single, serializing bus. Like a snooping cache protocol, MESIF relies on nodes with cached copies of data to maintain coherence. The use of point-to-point links rather than a synchronous, centralized broadcast introduces the problem of time-warp—the fact that events appear to occur in a different order from the viewpoint of different node. As described in greater detail below, the MESIF protocol handles time-warp, recognizing when potential errors could result and making sure that they are handled correctly. The notion of a Home node is used to determine where the uncached copy reside, but the Home node participates in every transaction—without being on the critical path—in order to resolve conflicts and time-warp issues. Because of the concurrent-broadcast nature of the scheme, MESIF achieves the low latency associated with snooping protocols, acquiring a cacheable copy of the data in most cases in the minimum possible latency: a single roundtrip request-response. (0023]       The basic MESIF protocol involves broadcasting an initial request to allpeer nodes as well as the Home node. If a copy is cached in state E, F, or M, it is included in the response. A second message is then sent to the Home node, informing it that the request has been satisfied.  If the requested line is uncached, or if only S-state copies exist, the second request sent to the Home node is used to confirm the previous request, which the Home node may have by now fetched from its memory. In either case, the<br>
Home node must respond to the second request (and to the first, though they can sometimes be combined) for purposes of synchronization and conflict resolution. Note that the Home node may have one or more caches, so it may respond to the initial request just like any other node.<br>
[0024]       Conflicts are handled in a distributed way. The timewarp problem makes it difficult to detect conflicts, because individual requests can be delayed for an arbitrarily long time. A conflict will be detected, however, if each node monitors for conflicts after making a request. Both nodes may or may not detect a conflict, but at least one will. Because all nodes must respond to a broadcast request either by supplying the data or indicating they do not have a copy (or, under some circumstances, are not supplying the copy they have), the response can include an indication of a conflict, so conflicting nodes will detect the conflict.<br>
[0025]       Complications arise from allowing a node to use the data as soon as the data arrives rather than waiting for all responses. Thus, a node receiving a copy of the data is allowed to use the data internally immediately upon receipt, but may not make the effects of using the data visible to the rest of the system until the node has received a confirmation from Home. The confirmation may also include instructions that the node must forward its copy to another node, and perhaps evict the node from its own cache. (0026J        Finally, when a node responds to a request from another node by supplying the cached data, the node must defer all other requests it receives for the same cache line until the node receives a response from the Home node acknowledging the fact that the node forwarded the data, thus assuring that all nodes observe the same order of transfer of the (possibly writable) cache line.<br>
[0027]        The Home node is the respository for the uncached data, but the home node also may have a processor generating requests and include one or more caches.  Like any other node, when the home nodes processor misses, the home node must broadcast requests to all other (peer) nodes, and the home node must handle the request internally as it would any other request arriving for the Home node. Note that this is a special case in that the home node does not explicitly send messages to itself (the Home node). In addition, when an external request arrives for data that is cached locally, the Home node must respond in a way to assure that a later response from the Home node is not ambiguous. That is, the home node may respond to the initial request by suppliying the data, but the home node must also respond to the second  request as the Home node. [0028]       Variants of the protocol allow the Home node to respond with the uncached copy of the data without knowing whether this data is valid, leaving it to the requesting node and the second response from the Home node to sort out the case where data was supplied inappropriately.<br>
[0029]       A more detailed, pseudo-code-based description of various embodiments of the MESIF protocol suitable for use as described herein are attached hereto as Appendix A.<br>
Overview of Non-Speculative Distributed Conflict Resolution<br>
[0030]        In general, a cache coherency protocol requires conflict resolution in order to provide orderly changes of state for the various cache lines or other blocks of data. A conflict resolution technique described herein provides sequential consistency, which means that only a single, modifiable copy of a cache line can be present at any time, and that no copy of a cache line can be modified while other copies are readable. Conflicting<br>
requests to modify a copy of a cache line must, therefore, be resolved in order to maintain<br>
sequential consistency.<br>
{0031]        In one embodiment, a conflict is resolved using the property of time. That is,<br>
regardless of delays, two nodes cannot both request a cache line before the other. Thus,<br>
conflicts can be detected by at least one of the conflicting requestors if each node<br>
monitors all requests after that node has made its own request.<br>
[0032]       In one embodiment, if a line is in the Exclusive (E), Modified (M) or forward<br>
(F) state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the<br>
conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which<br>
pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes<br>
eventually receive the requested data. In one embodiment, if a requested cache line is<br>
either uncached or present only in the Shared (S) state, the home node for the requested<br>
cache line provides a copy of the requested data and resolves conflicts.<br>
(0033]        In one embodiment, the distributed conflict resolution described herein is part<br>
of a cache protocol referred to as the MESIF protocol in which one of five states is<br>
associated with a cached copy of a cache line (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid,<br>
Forward). In one embodiment, a blackout period after all responses for a request until an<br>
acknowledgement message has been received from the home node allows all conflicting<br>
nodes to be aware of conflicts in which the nodes are involved. The blackout period does<br>
not limit use of the data in the cache, but does prevent the data from being propagated to<br>
other caches.<br>
[0034J        The discussion that follows is provided in terms of nodes within a multi-node<br>
system. In one embodiment, a node includes a processor having an internal cache<br>
memory, an external cache memory and/or an external memory. In an alternate embodiment, a node is an electronic system (e.g., computer system, mobile device) interconnected with other electronic systems. Other types of node configurations can also be used. In the examples that follow, dashed lines represent messages previously sent and solid lines represent messages being described. In order to keep the figures more clear, when a set of messages (e.g., PRIL and corresponding IACK) are resolved, the lines representing the messages are no longer included in the figures. {0035]        Figures 2a and 2b are conceptual illustrations of a request for a shared cached line. The numbering associated with the various messages of Figures 2a and 2b (e.g., 1. PRIL, 7. IACK) provide approximate ordering for purposes of explaining an example of a conflict. The exact timing relationships illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b, as well as the other examples provided (i.e., Figures 3a-3f) are not required.<br>
(0036]       As illustrated in Figure 2a, peer node 210 transmits a PRIL message to peer nodes 220 and 230 and to home node 240. Peer node 210 could also request the same block of data using a PRL message, in which case peer node 230 v/ould not invalidate its copy in response to the request message. Peer node 220 responds to the PRIL message with an IACK message indicating that peer node 220 cannot provide a valid copy of the requested data. Peer node 220 is illustrated as initially having a copy of the requested data in the S state, which is a valid copy of the data, but not a copy that can be provided in response to a request for a'copy of the data.<br>
[0037]        Because a PRIL message requests a copy of data and causes all other copies to invalidate remaining copies of the data, peer node 220 transitions the copy of the data in the S state to the I state. Because peer node 230 has a copy of the requested data in the F<br><br>
state (the only valid copy to be provided to a requestor), peer node 230 provides a copy of the requested data to peer node 210. Peer node 230 also transitions its copy of the requested data to the I state. Peer node 210 stores the requested data in the E state. Alternatively, peer node 210 stores the requested data in the F state. [0038J       As illustrated in Figure 2b, in response to receiving the requested data from peer node 230, peer node 210 sends a CNCL(230)() message to home node 240, which causes home node 240 to cancel retrieval of the requested data from memory (or to not transmit the data, if already retrieved). The CNCL(230)() message also indicates to home node 240 that a copy of the requested data was received from peer node 230 and that peer node 210 has not identified any conflicts with the PRJL message requesting the data. {00391       In response to the CNCL(230)() message from peer node 210, home node 240 transmits an ACK message to peer node 210 and a DACK message to peer node 230. The ACK message indicates to peer node 210 that home node 240 acknowledges receipt of the CNCL(230)() message. The DACK message from peer node 240 to peer node 230 acknowledges receipt of the data by peer node 210 and concludes the process for requesting data by peer node 210.<br>
[0040]       Figures 3a and 3b are conceptual illustrations of a request for a shared uncached line. As illustrated in Figure 3a, peer node 210 transmits a PRIL message to request a copy of a block of data^ Because peer nodes 220 and 230 do not store a valid copy of the requested data, nodes 220 and 230 respond with an I ACK message. {0041]        As illustrated in Figure 3b, because peer node 210 has received an IACK message from all peer nodes, peer node 210 sends a READQ message to home node 240, which requests a copy of the previously requested data that has been retrieved from<br>
memory by home node 240. The READ() message also indicates to home node 240 that peer node 210 has not identified any conflicts with the PRIL message. Home node 240 provides a copy of the requested data with a DataE message. In one embodiment, home node 240 also includes an ACIC message with the DataE message (i.e., in the same message packet). In an alternate embodiment, the DataE and ACK messages are transmitted separately.<br>
(0042]       Figures 4a through 4f are a conceptual illustration of three-way conflicting requests for a shared, cached line. As illustrated in Figure 4a, peer node 210 sends a PRL message to peer nodes 220 and 230 and to home node 240. The PRL message to home node 240 is delayed for some reason, for example, latency delays within system 200. In response to the PRL message, because neither peer node 220 nor peer node 230 can provide a valid copy of the requested data, peer node 220 and peer node 230 send IACK messages to peer node 210.<br>
{0043]       The PRL message from peer node 210 does not require any of the receiving peer nodes to invalidate copies, if any, stored by the receiving peer nodes. Peer node 210 can also use a PRIL message to request the data, which would require that all peer nodes storing the requested data, whether provided to the requesting node or not, to invalidate the copy of the requested data stored by the node. Conflicts can be caused by any combination^of messagesJhat would otherwise cause an inconsistent result. {0044]        As illustrated in Figure 4b, as some time after peer node 220 receives the PRL message from peer node 210 and before home node 240 receives the PRL message from peer node 210, peer node 220 transmits a PRIL message requesting the same block of data. Peer node 220 transmits the PRIL message to peer nodes 210 and 230 and to<br>
home node 240; however, the PRIL message to peer node 210 is delayed. Peer node 230<br>
and home node 240 respond to the PRIL message from peer node 220 with IACK<br>
messages.<br>
(0045)       As illustrated in Figure 4c, peer node 230 subsequently transmits a PRIL<br>
message to peer nodes 210 and 220 and to home node 240. Home node 240 responds to<br>
the PRIL message with an IACK message indicating that home node 240 does not store a<br>
valid copy of the requested data. Peer node 210 responds to the PRIL message from peer<br>
node 230 with a CNFL message indicating that peer node 210 has a conflict with the<br>
PRIL message received from peer node 230.<br>
(0046]       Peer node 220 responds to the PRIL message from peer node 230 with a<br>
CNFLI message indicating that peer node 220 has a conflict with the PRIL message<br>
received from peer node 230. The CNFLI message indicates that the conflicting message<br>
from peer node 220 is a PRIL message, which requires invalidation. The CNFL message<br>
from peer node 210 indicates that the conflicting message from peer node 210 is a PRL<br>
message, which does not require invalidation.<br>
(0047)       As illustrated in Figure 4d, when home node 240 receives the delayed PRL<br>
message from peer node 210, home node 240 responds with an IACK message indicating<br>
that home node 240 does not have a valid copy of the requested data.<br>
(0048]       In response to receiving the CNFL message from peer node 210 and the<br>
CNFLI message from peer node 220, peer node 230 transmits a READ(210, 220*)<br>
message to home node 240. The READ(210, 220*) message requests a copy of the data<br>
from memory controlled by home node 240. The READ(210, 220*) message also<br>
indicates that the request for data from peer node 230 conflicts with requests from peer<br>
nodes 210 and 220 and that the request from peer node 220 requires invalidation (as indicated by the asterisk). Because peer node 230 is the first node with a conflicting request to send a READ message to home node 240, peer node 230 is the first peer node to received a copy of the requested data and is the current owner of the requested data. [0049]        In response to the READ(210, 220*) message, home node provides the requested data to Peer node 230 with a DataE message. The DataE message causes peer node 230 to store the data in the E state. Alternatively, other data messages (e.g., DataF, DataS) could be used. Home node 240 retains the conflict list provided by peer node 230 to respond to subsequent READ/CNCL messages from peer nodes 210 and 220. [0050]       As illustrated in Figure 4e, in response to the IACK message from home node 240, peer node 210 transmits a READ(230*) message to home node 240. The READ message does not indicate the conflict with the PRIL message from peer node 220 because peer node 210 has not received the PRIL message yet. If peer node 210 had received the PRIL message from peer node 220, the READ message would indicate a conflict with peer node 220.<br>
[0051]        In response to the READ(230*) message, home node 240 sends a XFRI(210) message to peer node 230, which causes peer node 230 to send the requested data to peer node 210. The XFRI message also indicates to peer node 230 that a conflicting message from a peer node that has not yet received its data (peer node 220) requires invalidation of the data after the data is sent to peer node 210.<br>
[0052]        Peer node 230 sends the requested data to peer node 210 with a DataE(220) message, which causes peer node 210 to store the requested data in the E mode, and informs peer node 210 that the requesting message might conflict with a message from<br>
peer node 220. Peer node 230 had detected the conflict with the message from peer node 220. Before peer node 210 receives the requested data, the delayed PRJL message is received from peer node 220.<br>
[0053]       Because peer node 210 has already delivered its list of conflicts to home node 240 and has not received the requested data from peer node 230, peer node 210 stores the PRIL message received from peer node 220 in a buffer. In response to receiving the Data message from peer node 230 containing the conflict with peer node 220, peer node 210 responds with a CNFL message indicating that peer node 210 has a conflict with the PRJL message from peer node 220.<br>
(0054J	As illustrated in Figure 4f, in response to the CNFL message from peer<br>
node 210, peer node 230 sends a READ (210,230*) message to home node 240, which indicates a conflict with the PRL message from peer node 210 and the PRIL message from peer node 230. Home node 240 responds to the READ(210,230*) message with an ACK. message to peer node 220 and a XFRI(220) message to peer node 210. Peer node 210 sends the requested data to peer node 220 with a DataE(230) message. Peer node 220 previously detected the conflict with peer node 230. Delivery of the ACK message to peer node 220 indicates that no further conflicts exist with the PRIL message from peer node 220.<br>
(0055)       Figures 5a through 5g are conceptual illustrations of three-way conflicting requests for a uncached line.__As illustrated in Figure 5a, peer node 210 transmits a PRJL message to peer nodes 220 and 230 and to home node 240 to request a block of data. The PRJL message for home node 240 is delayed. Soon after peer node 210 transmits a PRIL<br>
message, peer node 220 transmits a PRIL message to peer nodes 210 and 230 and to<br>
home node 240 requesting a copy of the same block of data.<br>
[0056]       As illustrated in Figure 5b, peer node 230 responds to the PRIL message from<br>
peer node 210 with an IACK message. Peer node 230 indicates a delay in processing its<br>
response to the PRIL message from peer node 220. Peer node 210 responds to the PRIL<br>
message from peer node 220 with a CNFLI message. Similarly, peer node 220 responds<br>
to the PRIL message from peer node 210 with a CNFLI message.<br>
[0057]        As illustrated in Figure 5c, before nodes 210 and 220 receive a copy of the<br>
requested data, peer node 230 transmits a PRIL message to peer nodes 210 and 220 and<br>
to home node 240. Peer nodes 210 and 220 respond to the PRIL message from peer node<br>
230 with CNFLI messages. Due to its delay in processing the PRIL from peer node 220,<br>
peer node 230 sends a CNFLI message, instead of an IACK message, to peer node 220 to<br>
indicate a conflict with the newly generated request for the same block of data by peer<br>
node 230.<br>
[0058|        As illustrated in Figure 5d, after receiving responses from all peer nodes, peer<br>
node 230 sends a R£AD(210*,220*) message to home node 240. Home node 240<br>
responds with a DataE message to provide the requested data to peer node 230 because<br>
peer node 230 is the first peer node to send a READ message to home node 240. Peer<br>
node 230 is the current owner of the data.<br>
[0059J        As illustrated in Figure 5e, after receiving responses from all peer nodes, peer<br>
node 210 sends a READ(210*,230*) message to home node 240.  Home node 240 also<br>
receives the delayed PRIL message from peer node 210. Home node 240 responds to the<br>
PRIL message from peer node 210 with an IACK message, which indicates that home<br><br>
node 240 will not provide a copy of the requested data. This is because peer node 230 has a valid, cached copy of the requested data.<br>
[0060]       Home node 240 sends a XFRI(220) message to peer node 230 to cause peer node 230 to provide a copy of the requested data to peer node 210. Peer node 230 is the second peer node to receive a copy of the requested data because peer node 230 is the second peer node to send a READ message to home node 240 requesting the data. [0061]       As illustrated in Figure 5f, peer node 230 sends a copy of the requested data to peer node 220 with a DataE message. Peer node 210 sends a READ(220*, 230*) message to home node 240. Home node 240 responds to the READ message from peer node 210 by sending a XFRI(210) message to peer node 220, which causes peer node 220 to send a copy of the requested data to peer node 210.<br>
[0062J       As illustrated in Figure 5g, peer node 220 sends a copy of the requested data to peer node 210 with a DataE message. Peer node 220 also invalidates the copy of the data stored by peer node 220. Home node 240 sends an ACK message to peer node 210 to indicate that all requests for the block of data have been resolved and satisfied.<br>
