				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cycloalkyl-benzopyran compound and pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel cycloalkyl-benzopyrans and derivatives<br>
thereof, compositions containing those compounds, their use as selective estrogen<br>
receptor-beta agonists, and their use in the treatment of estrogen receptor-beta mediated<br>
diseases such as prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (hypertrophy), testicular<br>
cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders,<br>
urinary incontinence, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, gastrointestinal (GI) tract<br>
disorders, and osteoporosis.<br>
Estrogens play important roles in the development and homeostasis of the<br>
reproductive, central nervous, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems of both males and<br>
females. Recently, a new ER isoform, ER-beta (also known as ER-betal) was cloned<br>
from a rat prostatic cDNA library and is present in murine and human prostates.<br>
Consequently, the previous ER is now designated as ER-alpha. ER-alpha and ER-beta<br>
share high amino acid homology, have similar 17~β Estradiol (E2) binding affinities, and<br>
can hetero- or homodimerize to form a signaling complex; Kuiper GG, et al., Endocrinol.<br>
138: 863-70 (1997); Kuiper GG etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 5925-30 (1996).<br>
Although E2 activates both ER-alpha and ER-beta, ER-alpha stimulates transcription and<br>
cellular proliferation, while ER-beta suppresses ER-alpha activation. Interestingly, 3-<br>
beta, 17-beta-androstanediol and 5-alpha-androstane have been proposed to be<br>
endogenous ligands for ER-beta; Weihua Z. et al. PNAS 98: 6330-5 (2001). 3-Beta, 17-<br>
beta-androstanediol is a major metabolite of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the 5-alpha-<br>
reduced active intracellular androgen in male accessory sex organs. ER-beta activation<br>
also stimulates increased glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase expression.<br>
These two enzymes have been shown to possess chemoprotective detoxification<br>
properties; Chang WY et al., Prostate 40: 115-24 (1999); Montano MM et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 273: 25443-9 (1998).<br>
With the recent identification of ER-beta, and the recognition that ER-alpha and<br>
ER-beta have different biological roles, ER-selective modulators would similarly possess<br><br>
significant clinical utility. Since ER-beta is strongly expressed in a number of tissues<br>
including prostate, bladder, ovary, testis, lung, small intestine, vascular endothelium, and<br>
various parts of the brain, compounds that selectively modulate ER-beta would be of<br>
clinical importance in the treatment of a variety of disease conditions, such as prostate<br>
cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS disorders, GI tract disorders, and<br>
osteoporosis. Such compounds would have minimal effect on tissues that contain ER-<br>
alpha, and thus exhibit different side-effect profiles. Thus, ER-beta agonists will display<br>
different therapeutic profiles compared to ER-alpha antagonists or agonists, and would be<br>
preferentially beneficial in tissues relying on ER-beta signaling.<br>
The prostate gland produces components that are found in the semen and blood.<br>
Some of these are regulatory peptides. The prostate gland comprises stroma and<br>
epithelium cells, the latter group consisting of columnar secretory cells and basal non-<br>
secretory cells. The proliferation of these basal cells, as well as stroma cells gives rise to<br>
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is one common prostate disease. BPH is a<br>
progressive condition that is characterized by the nodular enlargement of the prostatic<br>
tissue resulting in obstruction of the urethra. This results in increased frequency of<br>
urination, noncuria, poor urine stream, and hesitation or delay in starting the urine flow.<br>
Consequences of BPH can include hypertrophy of bladder smooth muscle,<br>
decompensated bladder, and increased incidence of urinary tract infection. The<br>
development of BPH is considered to be an inescapable phenomenon for the aging male<br>
population. BPH is observed in approximately 70% of males over the age of 70. Drug<br>
treatment for BPH currently employs alpha andrenergic antagonists for symptomatic<br>
relief or steroid 5-alpha reductase inhibitors to reduce hyperplastic tissue bulk. These<br>
approaches are of limited therapeutic benefit.<br><br>

Reaction Schemes<br>
Compounds of formula (I) and intermediates thereof can be prepared as described<br>
in Reaction Schemes A-l below.   All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are<br>
previously defined. The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
In scheme A, alkyl substituted 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylates 2, wherein G is<br>
CHMe or CHt-Bu, were prepared using a Dieckmann cyclization of the alkyl substituted<br>
adipic acids 1, which are commercially available. To a heated solution of an appropriate<br>
base, such as NaOMe (sodium methoxide) in an appropriate solvent, such as toluene, an<br>
appropriate amount of 1 is added to give the corresponding 2-<br><br>
oxocyclopentanecarboxylates 2. The product of formula 2 can be isolated and purified by<br>
techniques well known in the art.<br>
The 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylates 2 are then reacted with an appropriate amount<br>
of trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) anhydride (Tf2O) in the presence of an appropriate<br>
base, as would be known to one skilled in the art, such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-<br>
pyridine or diisopropyl ethyl amine (iPr2NEt), to form the triflates 3, wherein G is CHMe<br>
or CHt-Bu (tertiary-butyl). The reaction may be carried out at room temperature and the<br>
product 3 isolated and purified by methods well known in the art.<br><br>
In scheme B, heterocycles 4, wherein G is either O or S, were prepared by<br>
Michael addition of methyl glycolate or methyl thioglycolate to methyl acrylate followed<br>
by Dieckmann cyclization in one pot. The methyl glycolate or methyl thioglycolate is<br>
added to a suspension of an appropriate base, preferably a metal hydride, such as sodium<br>
hydride (NaH) in ether and stirred until the evolution of H2 gas ceases in the case of<br>
methyl glycolate or NaOMe in methanol, in the case of methyl thioglycolate. The residue<br>
is concentrated and dissolved in DMSO, cooled, and then methyl acrylate is added drop<br>
wise. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room temperature and stirred. The product 4<br>
is then extracted and purified by methods well known in the art. The resulting<br>
heterocycles 4 are then reacted with Tf2O in the presence of an appropriate base to form<br>
triflates 3, wherein G is oxygen (O) or sulfur (S).<br><br><br>
In scheme C, hydroquinone 5 is protected as the bis-methoxymethyl (MOM) ether<br>
using sodium hydride and chloromethyl methyl ether (MOMC1). Ortho lithiation of<br>
protected hydroquinone 6 may be accomplished with .sec-butyllithium (sBuLi) followed<br>
by quenching with triisopropyl borate to form the boronic acid 7. Boronic acid 7 was<br>
coupled with triflates 3 using Suzuki conditions, using the reagents<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), lithium chloride (LiCI), sodium<br>
carbonate (Na2CO3), water and dimethoxyethane (DME) (Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem.<br>
Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483) to give unsaturated esters 8, wherein G is either CHMe, CHt-<br>
Bu, O or S.<br><br>
In scheme D, the unsaturated esters 8 as prepared in scheme C are hydrogenated<br>
over Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and then transformed into Weinreb amides 9, using<br>
isopropyl-magnesium chloride (iPr-MgCl) and N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine-HCl<br>
(HN(OMe)Me). The Weinreb amides 9 are then reacted with lithiated p-bromophenyl<br><br>
methoxymethyl ether in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give the<br>
corresponding ketones 10. Deprotection and cyclization of ketones 10 under acidic<br>
conditions para-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) in methanol is followed by reduction in<br>
the same pot with sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN). The reduction is kept acidic by<br>
addition of HC1 which gives benzopyrans 11, wherein G is CHMe, CHt-Bu, O or S.<br><br>
In scheme E, the tetrahydrothiophene 12, as prepared in scheme D (11d) may be<br>
oxidized to the sulfoxide 13 with potassium peroxymonosulfate (oxone) in MeOH and<br>
water at room temperature. The sulfone 14 is prepared from the tetrahydrothiophene 12<br>
using the same conditions with heating at 50° and longer reaction times.<br><br>
In scheme F, 2,5-dimethoxycinnamic acid 15 is treated with boron tribromide<br>
(BBr3) to form 6-hydroxycoumarin 16. 6-Hydroxycoumarin 16 can be protected as the<br>
bis-methoxymethyl ether (MOM) 17a using N,N-diisopropylethylamine (iPr2NEt) and<br>
MOMC1 or as the benzyl ether (Bn) 17b using cesium carbonate (CSCO3) and benzyl<br>
bromide (BnBr).<br><br><br>
methoxymethoxy coumarin 17a using Trost's trimethylenemethane chemistry by using 2-<br>
(acetyoxymethyl)allyl-triethylsilane, palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and triisopropyl<br>
phosphite (P(OiPr)3) (Trost, B. M.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, 25, 1-20). The<br>
exomethylene of 18 is dihydroxylated using osmium tetroxide (OSO4) and N-<br>
methylmorpholine N-oxide followed by protection of the diol using phosgene (Cl2CO) to<br>
give the cyclic carbonate 19. The enol triflate 20 is then formed by deprotonating 19 with<br>
an appropriate base, as known by one skilled in the art, such as lithium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LHMDS) followed by trapping the enolate with N-<br>
phenyltrifiuoromethanesulfonimide (PhNTf2) in the presence of<br>
hexamethylphophoramide [HMPA] in an appropriate solvent, such as THF. The enol<br>
triflate 20 was coupled with lithiated p-bromophenyl methoxymethyl ether using Negishi<br>
conditions using zinc chloride (ZnCl2), Pd(PPh3)4, in an appropriate solvent, such as THF<br>
(Negishi, E. Ace. Chem. Res. 1982,15, 340-348) to give flavene 21. The enol of flavene<br>
21 is reduced with hydrogen over Pd/C in an appropriate solvent such as THF and<br>
methanol to give flavan 22. The carbonate of flavan 22 is then hydrolyzed with an<br>
appropriate base, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH), followed by oxidative cleavage of<br>
the diol with an appropriate oxidant such as sodium periodate (NaI04) in one pot to give<br>
the cyclopentanone 23. The methoxymethyl protecting groups of 23 could then be<br><br><br><br>
azodicarboxylate (DEAD), triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (Mitsunobu, O. Synthesis, 1981, 1-<br>
28.), followed by hydrolysis of the benzoate with an appropriate base, such as, lithium<br>
hydroxide (LiOH), to give alcohol 27, wherein G is CHOH. Cyclopentanone 23 is treated<br>
with (diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) to give difluorocyclopentane 29 which is<br>
deprotected under acid conditions, such as HC1 in THF, to give difluorocyclopentane 30,<br>
wherein G is CF2. Cyclopentanone 23 is reacted with (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane<br>
(TMSCF3) in the presence of tetra-butyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give alcohol 31.<br>
Radical deoxygenation of 31 is accomplished via the methyl oxalyl ester (formed using<br>
methyl chloroglyoxylate (ClCOC02Me), DMAP, and Et3N), using triphenyltin hydride<br>
(Bu3SnH) and 2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as described by Dolan (Dolan, S.C.;<br>
MacMillan, J. J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. 1985, 1588-1589) to give trifluoromethyls<br>
32 and 33 as a separable mixture of diastereomers. The diastereomers are then separately<br>
deprotected, under acidic conditions, such as HC1 in THF, to give trifluoromethyls 34 and<br>
35, wherein G is CHCF3. Cyclopenanone 23 was reacted with Grignard reagents<br>
(R'MgBr, for example) in the presence of cerium trichloride (CeCl3) to give alcohols 36<br>
which are deprotected under acidic conditions, such as HC1 in THF, to give alcohols 37.<br>
Radical deoxygenation of 36 was accomplished as described above for 31 to give alkyl<br>
substituted cyclopentanes 38 which are deprotected to give alkyl cyclopentanes 39,<br>
wherein G is CHEt (ethyl). One skilled in the art would know how to make other<br>
equivalent benzopyrans wherein G is CH(C1-C6) lower alkyl, by the appropriate Grignard<br>
reagent.<br><br><br>
Alcohol 25 may also be reacted with alkyl halides, such as methyl iodide (R'X), to<br>
give alkyl ethers 40, which are then deprotected, under acidic conditions, such as HC1 in<br>
THF, to give alkyl ethers 41, wherein G is CHOR', wherein R' is (Ci-C6) lower alkyl.<br>
Alcohols 25 may also be reacted with any appropriate alkyl acyl chloride or alkyl acyl<br>
anhydride, such as acetic anhydride (AC2O), in the presense of an appropriate base and an<br>
appropriate acylation catalyst, such as dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to give alkyl<br>
esters 42 which are deprotected, under acidic conditions, to give alkyl esters 43, wherein<br>
G is CHOR', wherein R' is defined as above. Alcohols 25 may also be reacted with<br>
(diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) to give fluorocyclopentanes 44 which is<br>
deprotected, under acidic conditions, to give fluorocyclopentanes 45, wherein G is CHF.<br>
In the same way as described above alcohol 27 may be converted into the corresponding<br>
diastereomer such as fluorocyclopentane 47, wherein G is CHF.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (II) and intermediates thereof can be prepared as described<br>
in Reaction Schemes J-O below. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are<br>
previously defined. The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
Beginning with the known hydroxy-coumarin 1 (Cramer, Chem Ber. 1956, 89,<br>
354), protection of the phenol as its benzyl ether using an appropriate metal hydride, such<br>
as sodium hydride (NaH) with an appropriate benzylating agent such as benzyl bromide<br>
(BnBr), as would be known by one skilled in the art, provides coumarin 2. Diels-Alder<br>
reaction with 2-trimethylsilyloxy-l,3-butadiene in solvent such as ortho-xylene, at a<br>
temperature of approximately 130° C, followed by workup of the reaction in a<br>
desilylating agent, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), provides the desired<br><br>
cycloaddition product 3. A two-step decarboxylation provides keto-lactone 4, by first<br>
treating compound 3 with a hydroxide source, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH) in an<br>
appropriate solvent mixture, such at tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol and water, followed<br>
by refluxing of the intermediate carboxylic acid in an appropriate solvent, such as<br>
xylenes. Ketone 4 is selectively protected as it cyclic acetal 5, by treating ketone 4 with<br>
the protecting agent ethylene glycol (HO(CH2)2OH), in the presence of a suitable acid,<br>
such as para-toluene sulfonic acid (TsOH) in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, using a<br>
Dean-Stark apparatus, as is known by one skilled in the art. Treatment of the lactone 5<br>
with a suitable base, such as potassium hexamethyldisilazane (KHMDS) in the prescence<br>
of stoichiometric hexamethylphophoramide (HMPA), followed by quenching of the<br>
enolate with a suitable triflating source such as N-phenyl triflamide (PhNTf2) provides the<br>
intermediate enol triflate 6 as a clear solid. Suzuki cross-coupling of 6 with<br>
parabenzyloxyphenylboronic acid, in the presence of chloride salt, such as lithium<br>
chloride (LiCl), and a suitable base, such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), using a metal<br>
catalyst such as palladium-tetrakis triphenylphosphine (Pd(PPh3)4) in a suitable solvent,<br>
such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) provides the enol ether 7 under reflux.<br>
Hydrogenation of the benzyl ethers and the alkene of 7 using a metal catalyst, such<br>
palladium on carbon (Pd-C) in a protic solvent, such as methanol under a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere, affords diphenol 8. This step is followed by acid-promoted cleavage of the<br>
ketal protecting group, using an acid such as HC1 in an appropriate solvent, such as<br>
THF/H2O, affords the desired ketone 9 in good yield.<br><br><br>
Furthermore in scheme L, protection of 9 as its bis-tertbutyldimethylsilyl ether<br>
(TBS) using an appropriate silylating agent, such as tertbutyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-<br>
Cl) in the presence of an appropriate base, such as imidazole, provides bis-silyl ether 12.<br>
Alternatively, protection of 9 as its bis-methoxymethyl ether (MOM) 13, using an<br>
appropriate protecting agent such methoxymethyl chloride (MOM-C1), in the presence of<br>
an appropriate base, such as potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), in an appropriate solvent,<br>
such as dimethylformamide (DMF) provides bis-ether 13.<br><br><br>
Bis silyl ether 12 is treated with the Tebbe reagent (Cp2TiCl(H)Me), in the<br>
presence of pyridine base, in an appropriate solvent, such as THF, at a temperature range<br>
of -35- -50° C, affords the alkenylated product 14. Desilylation with an appropriate<br>
fluoride source, such as TBAF, with an appropriate solvent, such as THF, provides exo-<br>
methylene 15, which is then hydrogenated with a suitable metal catalyst, such as Pd-C, in<br>
an appropriate protic solvent, such as methanol, under an atmosphere of hydrogen, to<br>
provide an approximately 1:1 mixture of inseparable methylated product 16.<br><br><br>
In scheme N, treatment of the bis-MOM ether 13 from scheme K, with a<br>
fluorinating source, such as (diethylamino) sulfur trifluoride (DAST) at 45° C, in a<br>
suitable chlorinated solvent, such as 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), affords the gem-<br>
difluoro intermediate 17. Removal of the MOM protecting groups is carried out with a<br>
suitable acid, such HC1, in an appropriate solvent mixture, such as THF, in the presence<br>
of water affords the desired difluoride 18.<br><br><br>
In scheme O, the synthesis of isomeric ketone 27 is carried out in the manner<br>
described below. Allyl-Grignard addition, using an appropriate allyl-Grignard reagent,<br>
such as allyl-magnesium bromide at low temperature, such as 0° C, in a suitable ethereal<br>
solvent, such as THF, to the aforementioned coumarin 2, from scheme J, in a 1,4 sense<br>
provides the p-keto ester 19. Decarboxylation of 19 to 20 occurs under identical<br>
conditions as the conversion of 3 to 4 as described in scheme J. Deprotonation of 20 using<br><br>
an appropriate base, such as KHMDS, in the presence of HMPA, followed by reaction of<br>
the enolate with an appropriate allylating reagent, such as 2-methoxymethyl-allyl iodide<br>
provides allylated 21. Ring closing metathesis of 21 using an appropriate Grubbs reagent<br>
a, such as [l,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-<br>
imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(phenylmethylene)-tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium], in a<br>
suitable chlorinated solvent, such as methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), at a concentration of<br>
0.01M at reflux, affords the cyclic enol-ether 22. Hydrolysis of the enol ether, using an<br>
appropriate acid, such as HC1, in an ethereal solvent, such as THF containing water<br>
provides the intermediate ketone, which is converted to ketal 23 under identical<br>
conditions as described above for the conversion of 4 to 5 in scheme K. Conversion of<br>
the ketal 23 to final ketone 27 identically follows the conversion of ketal 5 to ketone 9 as<br>
described in scheme J.<br><br>
In Scheme P, an alternative synthesis of cyclopentanone 24 with benzyl protecting<br>
groups on the phenols is described. The cyclopentanoid 48 is formed via [3+2]<br>
cycloaddition to 8-benzyloxy coumarin 17b using Trost's trimethylenemethane chemistry<br>
using 2-(acetyoxymethyl)allyl-triethylsilane, palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and<br>
triisopropyl phosphite (P(OiPr)3) (Trost, B. M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, 25, 1-<br><br>
20). The enol triflate 49 is then formed by deprotonating 48 with an appropriate base, as<br>
known by one skilled in the art, such as potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS)<br>
followed by trapping the enolate with an appropriate triflating agent such as .V-<br>
phenyltrifluoromethanesulfonimide (PhNTf2) in an appropriate solvent, such as THF.<br>
The enol triflate 49 can be coupled using Negishi conditions with the aryl zinc derived<br>
from p-bromophenylbenzyl ether, an appropriate palladium catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)4, in<br>
an appropriate solvent, such as THF (Negishi, E. Ace. Chem. Res. 1982, 15, 340-348) to<br>
give flavene 50. The enol of flavene 50 is reduced with triethylsilane (Et3SiH) in the<br>
presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in methylene chloride to give flavan 51. The<br>
exomethylene of 51 is dihydroxylated using osmium tetroxide (OsO4 )and N-<br>
methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO) followed by oxidative cleavage of the diol with an<br>
appropriate oxidant such as sodium periodate (NaI04) in one pot to give the<br>
cyclopentanone 52.<br><br>
In Scheme Q, cyclopentanone 52 is converted into two nitrile substituted<br>
diastereomers. The ketone of cyclopentanone 52 can be reduced with an appropriate<br>
hydride reagent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by displacement of the<br>
resulting alcohol with cyanide using acetone cyanohydrin under appropriate Mitsunobu<br>
conditions (Mitsunobu, O. Synthesis 1981, 1-28) to afford nitrile 53. Nitrile 53 is<br>
deprotected using appropriate hydrogenation conditions such as 10% palladium on carbon<br>
(Pd/C) and hydrogen (H2) to give deprotected nitrile 54. To obtain the opposite<br>
diastereomer, the ketone of cyclopentanone 52 is reduced to the alcohol as described<br>
above and then inverted using p-nitrobenzoic acid under appropriate Mitsunobu<br><br>
conditions followed by hydrolysis of the benzoate using lithium hydroxide (LiOH)<br>
followed by displacement of the resulting alcohol with cyanide as described above to<br>
afford nitrile 55. Nitrile 55 is deprotected using appropriate hydrogenation conditions as<br>
described above to give deprotected nitrile 56.<br><br>
In scheme R, the benzyl protecting groups of cyclopentanone 52 are exchanged<br>
for silyl protecting groups. The benzyl protecting groups are removed using appropriate<br>
hydrogenation conditions such as 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen (H2)<br>
followed by reaction with tri-tert-butylsilyl chloride (TBSC1), catalytic N,N-<br>
dimethylaminopyrindine (DMAP), and imidazole in dimethylformamide (DMF) to give<br>
silyl protected cyclopentanone 57. Silyl protected cyclopentanone 57 is reacted with the<br>
phosponium ylide prepared from methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and potassium<br>
hexamethyldisilazane (KHMDS) to give alkene 58. Alkene 58 is deprotected using<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to afford deprotected alkene 59. Silyl protected<br>
cyclopentanone 57 is reacted with the lithium anion of<br>
(Difluoromethyl)diphenylphosphine oxide using the conditions described by Edwards et<br>
al. (Edwards, M. L.; Stemerick, D. M.; Jarvi, E. T.; Matthews, D. P.; McCarthy, J. R.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett.  1990, 31, 5571-5574) to give difluoromethylene 60.<br><br>
Difluoromethylene 60 can be deprotected using TBAF to give deprotected<br>
difluoromethylene 61.<br><br>
In Scheme S, cyclopentanone 57 is reacted with the organocerium reagent formed<br>
by lithiating trimethylsilylacetylene with n-butyllithium followed by reaction with cerium<br>
trichloride to give an alcohol. Radical deoxygenation of the alcohol is accomplished via<br>
the methyl oxalyl ester (formed using methyl chloroglyoxylate (ClCOC02Me), DMAP,<br>
and Et3N), using phenyltin hydride (Ph3SnH) and 2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as<br>
described by Dolan et al. (Dolan, S.C.; MacMillan, J. J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun.<br>
1985, 1588-1589) to give alkyne 62 as a 5:1 mixture of diastereomers. Alkyne 62 was<br>
deprotected with TBAF to give deprotected alkyne 63 as a 5:1 mixture of diastereomers.<br><br>
In Scheme T, cyclopentanone 52 is reacted with a series of phosphonium ylide<br>
reagents generated from alkyl or benzyl triphenyl-phosphonium halides (RPPh3X) such as<br>
ethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (EtPPrt3Br) using an appropriate base such as<br>
postassium hexamethyldisilazane (KHMDS) to give alkenes 64.   The alkencs can be<br>
reduced and the benzyl protecting groups removed in the same reaction using appropriate<br>
hydrogenation conditions such as 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen (H2) to<br>
give deprotected alkenes 65.<br><br><br>

Test Procedures<br>
ER Binding Assay<br>
The competition ER binding assay was run in a buffer containing 50 mM N-[2-<br>
hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) pH 7.5, 1.5 mM EDTA, 150<br>
mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/mL ovalbumin, 5mM DTT, 0.025 u.Ci per well of 3H-<br>
Estradiol(NEN #NET517 at 118 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL), and 10 ng/well ERAlpha or<br>
ERbeta Receptor (PanVera). Competing compounds were added at 10 different<br>
concentrations. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uJvl of E2 (17-<br>
P Estradiol, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The binding reaction (140 uX) was incubated for 4<br>
hours at room temperature, then 70 u.L of cold dextran coated charcoal (DCC) buffer was<br>
added to each reaction (E&gt;CC buffer was prepared by adding 0.75g of charcoal [Sigma]<br>
and 0.25g of dextran [Pharmacia] per 50 mL of assay buffer). The incubation plates were<br>
mixed for 8 minutes on an orbital shaker at 4°C and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes at 4°C. An aliquot of 120 uJ of the mix was transferred to another 96-well, white<br>
flat bottom plate (Costar) and 175 ^1 of Wallac Optiphase Hisafe 3 scintillation fluid was<br><br>
added to each well. The plates were sealed and then shaken vigorously on an orbital<br>
shaker. After an incubation of 2.5hrs, the radioactivity was counted in a Wallac<br>
Microbeta counter. The IC50 and percent inhibition at IO^IM were calculated. The Kd for<br>
3H-Estradiol was determined by saturation binding to ERa and ERp receptors. The 1C50<br>
values for compounds were converted to Kj values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and<br>
the Kd values were determined by saturation binding assay. Compounds of Examples 1-<br>
19 and 22-25 are active in the assay as described.   Preferred compounds bind to the ER<br>
beta receptor with a K, of less than 20 nM. More preferred compounds bind to the ER<br>
beta receptor with a K, of less than 1 nM. Compounds that are selective to binding to the<br>
ER beta receptor compared to the ER alpha receptor bind to the ER beta receptor with a<br>
lower Kj compared to the Kj for the ER alpha receptor.<br>
As determined by the above assay, the compounds of examples 1-32 exhibit<br>
binding affinities (Kis) at the ER Alpha subtype in the range 5.0-&gt;10,000nM and to the<br>
ER beta subtype in the range of 0.20-429nM.<br>
LNCaP Human PCa Xenograft Assay<br>
ERbeta agonists are evaluated for their effects on the growth of androgen-<br>
sensitive LNCaP human prostatic cancer (PCa) xenografts grown in intact sexually<br>
mature (5-6 weeks old) Hsd: Athymic Nude-nu (Athymic Nude) male mice. 2.0x10^<br>
LNCaP tumor cells are injected bilaterally by the subcutaneous route into the pre-tracheal<br>
region of testicular intact male mice. Mice are castrated via the scrotal route to serve as<br>
the positive control group. Test compounds are administered once per day by<br>
subcutaneous or gavage administration at multiple dose levels in a volume of 0.2 ml to<br>
xenograft-bearing mice starting on the day following tumor injection. Test compounds<br>
are reformulated weekly based on average group mean body weights. The vehicle for<br>
these studies is 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with 0.25% Tween 80. Body<br>
weights and tumor measurements are recorded on a weekly basis and entered directly into<br>
a JMP™ (SAS; Cary, NC) spreadsheet from electronic caliper measurement. Tumor<br>
volumes in mm^ are calculated in JMP using the following formula: L X W X H X<br>
0.5236. Tumor and body weight responses for individual mice are recorded on a weekly<br>
basis. When LNCaP tumor volumes enter log-phase expansion, lesions are measured<br><br>
every 3-4 days. Growth rates are determined using linear modeling of the log tumor<br>
values and time to treatment failure (tumor vol= 1300-1500 mm^) are determined using a<br>
linear extrapolation model (SAS; Cary, NC). Because of humane animal use<br>
considerations, animals are sacrificed when their tumor volumes approach 1200-1400<br>
mm^. At necropsy, final tumor measurement and body weights are recorded and whole<br>
blood is obtained via cardiac puncture and allowed to clot on ice. Serum is transferred to<br>
appropriately labeled 0.5 ml Eppendorf micro tubes, and samples are stored at -80°C for<br>
biomarker analysis.<br>
General Rat Preparation Procedure<br>
Seventy-five day old (unless otherwise indicated) female Sprague Dawley rats<br>
(weight range of 200 to 225g) are obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Portage,<br>
MI). The animals are either bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) or exposed to a Sham<br>
surgical procedure at Charles River Laboratories, and then shipped after one week. Upon<br>
arrival, they are housed in metal hanging cages in groups of 3 or 4 per cage and have ad<br>
libitum access to food (calcium content approximately 0.5%) and water for one week.<br>
Room temperature is maintained at 22.2° ± 1.7°C with a minimum relative humidity of<br>
40%. The photoperiod in the room was 12 hours light and 12 hours dark.<br>
Dosing Regimen Tissue Collection: After a one week acclimation period<br>
(therefore, two weeks post-OVX) daily dosing with a compound of formula (I) ("F-I") is<br>
initiated. 17a-ethynyl estradiol or F-I is given orally, unless otherwise stated, as a<br>
suspension in 1% carboxymethylcellulose or dissolved in 20% cyclodextrin. Animals are<br>
dosed daily for 4 days. Following the dosing regimen, animals are weighed and<br>
anesthetized with a ketamine: Xylazine (2:1, v:v) mixture and a blood sample is collected<br>
by cardiac puncture. The animals are then sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2, the<br>
uterus is removed through a midline incision, and a wet uterine weight is determined.<br>
17a-ethynyl estradiol is obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO.<br><br>
Cardiovascular Disease/Hyperlipidemia<br>
The blood samples from above are allowed to clot at room temperature for 2<br>
hours, and serum is obtained following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Serum<br>
cholesterol is determined using a Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics high performance<br>
cholesterol assay. Briefly the cholesterol is oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then reacted with phenol and 4-aminophenazone in<br>
the presence of peroxidase to produce a p-quinone imine dye, which is read<br>
spectrophotemetrically at 500 nm. Cholesterol concentration is then calculated against a<br>
standard curve. The entire assay is automated using a Biomek Automated Workstation.<br>
Uterine Eosinophil Peroxidase (EPO) Assay<br>
The uteri from above are kept at 4°C until time of enzymatic analysis. The uteri<br>
are then homogenized in 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.005%<br>
Triton X-100. Upon addition of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 10 mM O-<br>
phenylenediamine (final concentrations) in Tris buffer, increase in absorbance is<br>
monitored for one minute at 450 nm. The presence of eosinophils in the uterus is an<br>
indication of estrogenic activity of a compound. The maximal velocity of a 15 second<br>
interval is determined over the initial, linear portion of the reaction curve.<br>
Inhibition of Bone Loss (Osteoporosis) Test Procedure<br>
Following the general preparation procedure described above, the rats are treated<br>
daily for thirty-five days (6 rats per treatment group) and sacrificed by carbon dioxide<br>
asphyxiation on the 36th day. The thirty-five day time period is sufficient to allow<br>
maximal reduction in bone density, measured as described herein. At the time of<br>
sacrifice, the uteri are removed, dissected free of extraneous tissue, and the fluid contents<br>
are expelled before determination of wet weight in order to confirm estrogen deficiency<br>
associated with complete ovariectomy. Uterine weight is routinely reduced about 75% in<br>
response to ovariectomy. The uteri are then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin to<br>
allow for subsequent histological analysis.<br><br>
The right femurs are excised and digitilized X-rays generated and analyzed by an<br>
image analysis program (NIH image) at the distal metaphysis. The proximal aspect of the<br>
tibiae from these animals are also scanned by quantitative computed tomography. In<br>
accordance with the above procedures, F-I or ethynyl estradiol (EE2) in 20%<br>
hydroxypropyl p-cyclodextrin are orally administered to test animals.<br>
Therapeutic Methods of Use and Dosages<br>
Various diseases and conditions described to be treated herein, are well known<br>
and appreciated by those skilled in the art. It is also recognized that one skilled in the art<br>
may affect the associated diseases and conditions by treating a patient presently afflicted<br>
with the diseases or conditions or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with the<br>
diseases or conditions with a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of<br>
formula (I).<br>
As used herein, the term "patient" refers to a warm blooded animal such as a<br>
mammal that is afflicted with a particular estrogen receptor-beta mediated disease. It is<br>
understood that guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, horses, cattle, sheep, and humans are<br>
examples of animals within the scope of the meaning of the term.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of<br>
formula (I) refers to an amount which is effective in controlling diseases and conditions<br>
associated with estrogen receptor-beta mediated diseases such as prostate cancer, benign<br>
prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative<br>
disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS disorders, GI tract disorders, and osteoporosis. The<br>
term "controlling" is intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing,<br>
interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of the diseases and conditions<br>
described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease and<br>
condition symptoms, but does include prophylactic treatment of the diseases and<br>
conditions associated with estrogen receptor-beta mediated diseases such as prostate<br>
cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, cardiovascular diseases,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS, GI tract disorders, and<br>
osteoporosis.<br><br>
A therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending<br>
diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by<br>
observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the<br>
therapeutically effective amount, the dose, a number of factors are considered by the<br>
attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size,<br>
age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the<br>
severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound<br>
administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristic of the<br>
preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication;<br>
and other relevant circumstances.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) is expected to<br>
vary from about 0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to<br>
about 100 mg/kg/day. Preferred amounts can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
In effecting treatment of a patient afflicted with the diseases and conditions<br>
described above, a compound of formula (I) can be administered in any form or mode<br>
which makes the compound bioavailable in a therapeutically effective amount, including<br>
oral, inhalation, and parenteral routes. For example, compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
administered orally, by inhalation of an aerosol or dry powder, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, intravenously, transdermally, intranasally, rectally, topically, and the<br>
like. Oral or inhalation administration is generally preferred for treatment of respiratory<br>
diseases, e.g. asthma. One skilled in the art of preparing formulations can readily select<br>
the proper form and mode of administration depending upon the particular characteristics<br>
of the compound selected, the disease or condition state to be treated, the stage of the<br>
disease or condition, and other relevant circumstances. (Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1990)).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in the form<br>
of a pharmaceutical composition in combination with pharmaceutical ly acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients, the proportion and nature of which are determined by the solubility<br>
and chemical properties of the compound selected, the chosen route of administration,<br>
and standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds of the present invention, while<br>
effective themselves, may be formulated and administered in the form of their<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as acid addition salts or base addition salts, for<br>
purposes of stability, convenience of crystallization, increased solubility and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I)<br>
in admixture or otherwise in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art. The carrier or excipient may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material,<br>
which can serve as a vehicle or medium for the active ingredient. Suitable carriers or<br>
excipients are well known in the art. The pharmaceutical composition may be adapted for<br>
oral, inhalation, parenteral, or topical use and may be administered to the patient in the<br>
form of tablets, capsules, aerosols, inhalants, suppositories, solution, suspensions, or the<br>
like.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, for example,<br>
with an inert diluent or with an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules<br>
or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the<br>
compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches,<br>
capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gums and the like. These<br>
preparations should contain at least 4% of the compound of the present invention, the<br>
active ingredient, but may be varied depending upon the particular form and may<br>
conveniently be between 4% to about 70% of the weight of the unit. The amount of the<br>
compound present in compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
Preferred compositions and preparations according to the present invention may be<br>
determined by someone skilled in the art.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like may also contain one or more of<br>
the following adjuvants: binders such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or<br>
gelatin; excipients such as starch or lactose, disintegrating agents such as alginic acid,<br>
Primogel, corn starch and the like; lubricants such as magnesium stearate or Sterotex;<br>
glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and sweetening agents such as sucrose or<br>
saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate or<br>
orange flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to<br>
materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as polyethylene glycol or a fatty oil.<br><br>
Other dosage unit forms may contain other various materials that modify the physical<br>
form of the dosage unit, for example, as coatings. Thus, tablets or pills may be coated<br>
with sugar, shellac, or other enteric coating agents. A syrup may contain, in addition to<br>
the present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and<br>
colorings and flavors. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be<br>
pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
For the purpose of parenteral therapeutic administration, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may be incorporated into a solution or suspension. These preparations<br>
should contain at least 0.1% of a compound of the invention, but may be varied to be<br>
between 0.1 and about 50% of the weight thereof. The amount of the compound of<br>
formula (I) present in such compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
Preferred compositions and preparations are able to be determined by one skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered by inhalation,<br>
such as by aerosol or dry powder. Delivery may be by a liquefied or compressed gas or<br>
by a suitable pump system that dispenses the compounds of the present invention or a<br>
formulation thereof. Formulations for administration by inhalation of compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be delivered in single phase, bi-phasic, or tri-phasic systems. A variety<br>
of systems are available for the administration by aerosols of the compounds of formula<br>
(I). Dry powder formulations are prepared by either pelletizing or milling the compound<br>
of formula (I) to a suitable particle size or by admixing the pelletized or milled compound<br>
of formula (I) with a suitable carrier material, such as lactose and the like. Delivery by<br>
inhalation includes the necessary container, activators, valves, subcontainers, and the like.<br>
Preferred aerosols and dry powder formulations for administration by inhalation are able<br>
to be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered topically, and<br>
when done so the carrier may suitably comprise a solution, ointment or gel base. The<br>
base, for example, may comprise one or more of the following: petrolatum, lanolin,<br>
polyethylene glycols, bee wax, mineral oil, diluents such as water and alcohol, and<br>
emulsifiers and stabilizers. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of the<br>
formula (I) or its pharmaceutical salt from about 0.1 to about 10% w/v (weight per unit<br>
volume).<br><br>
The solutions or suspensions may also include one or more of the following<br>
adjuvants: sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,<br>
polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial<br>
agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or<br>
sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such<br>
as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as<br>
sodium chloride or dextrose. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules,<br>
disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br><br>
