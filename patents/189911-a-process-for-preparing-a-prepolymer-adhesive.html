The presnt      invention  relates  to a  process  of  preparing  a prepolymer adhesive.<br>
The  use  of  plasticised poly (vinyl  chloride)  for  biomedical applications  is mainly as extracorporeal tubings and blood  bag. The performance of the products manufactured from the plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) is dependent generally upon the interaction between  the product and the surrounding medium. In most  of  the applications,  plasticized  poly (vinyl) chloride is  in  contact with  some kind of surrounding liquid medium. During  manufacture of  plasticized  poly  (vinyl chloride) sheet  di-2  ethyl  hexyl phthalEte (DEHP) is added as plasticizer to plasticize the  rigid poly (vinyl chloride) polymer and to get the desired product- But with  time,  this plasticizer migrate to the  surrounding  liquid medium  leading  to create brittleness and early failure  of  the product. In application where no liquid medium is in contact with the product, migration of plasticizer takes place due to environ¬mental   ageing,  and  known  as. sweating.  The   migration   of undesirable  event, because the plasticizer DEHP is  metabolished to give monoethyl hexylphthalate (MEHP) in vivo and cause cardie-toxic  effect  on  human heart muscle.  Hypotension  and  cardiac arrest  occurred  in  rats following the infusion  of  MEHP  when circulating blood levels exceeded 75 ug per ml.. In this  connec¬tion,  reference  is  invited  to  (6.ROCK,  Transfusion   30(8),<br><br>
767(1990). The therapeutic level of DEHP for human at no effect level is 60 ug/kg body weight per day. (A S Chawla and I Hinberg Biomat. Art Cell h Immob. Biotech 19(4) 761-783(1991). Higher doses of DEHP have been found to be mutagenic and teratogenic. Therefore, the performance of the products manufactured from plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) largely depends on its resis¬tance to leach DEHP into the surrounding medium. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention to propose a process for chemical treatment of polyvinyl chloride materials which is not only reliable but also simple and economical.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a parti¬cular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparing a prepolymer adhesive comprising preparing a hydroxyl terminated polyurethane prepolymer (component A) by reacting cycloaliphatic diiosocyanate and a polyol component and drying said component A;<br>
subjecting said dried component A to the step of treatment with a diisocyanate (comonent B) to obtain a resinous prepolymer adhesive.<br><br>
According to this invention is provided a process for the prepa¬ration of a resinous prepolymer adhesive.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the PVC material is subjected to 3 first step of cleaning with s non-polar solvent, and then to a second step of cleaning in an ultrasonic cleaner using a detergent solution which is   then dried.<br>
Basically,  the  steps  of cleaning and  chemical  treatment  are broadly carried out on an experiments basis as follows :<br>
I.  Initially,  cleaning  of plasticized  poly  <vinyl chloride></vinyl>
product is carried out using s non-polar organic solvent for  1-5<br>
mins. to remove surface—adhered plasticizers and lubricants, etc.<br>
followed  by cleaning in an  Itrasonic cleaner using B  detergent<br>
solution  and deionised water, and then dried at the  temperature<br>
o of 30-70 C for 10-40 hrs,.<br>
II.  Chemical  treatment  of cleaned snd  dried  PVC  product  is carried out using a prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane.<br><br>
(a)	An aliphatic prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane was prepared<br>
by reacting two component mixtures containing component A and<br>
component B. Component A is a hydroxyl terminated polyurethane<br>
prepolymer and Component B is a diisocyanate. Component A was<br>
prepared with the reaction between a cycloaliphatic diisocyanate<br>
and excess polyol having trifunctionality and nitrogen atom<br>
in the presence of a tin catalyst at 70-150°C for a duration<br>
of 30-180 mins. in an inert atmosphere using an amide solvent.<br>
The resin was dried. This dried resin A was reacted with<br>
Component B at 40-100 C for a duration of 2-20 mins.. The<br>
resinous prepolymer adhesive was used for coating the PVC<br>
product.<br>
(b)	The clean PVC product was dipcoated for 1-10 mins. using<br>
the prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane immediately after the<br>
preparation of prepolymer adhesive. Dipcoating was moderated<br>
using a ketone solvent.<br>
(c)	Dipcoated products were then cured at 40-120"C for a duration<br>
of 10-50 hrs..<br>
(d)	The chemically modified PVC product is then cleaned in<br>
running water, deionized water and dried at 40-70°C for 1-4<br>
hrs. .<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
For an experimental study, we used plasticized poly (vinyl<br><br>
chloride) sheet and tube containing of 30 phr of diethyl hexyl phthalate and 10 phr of dioctyl adipate plasticizers.<br>
Calendered PVC sheet (0.35mm thickness) and extruded PVC tube were chemically treated as detailed above. The coating thickness is 0.18mm in each side of a PVC sheet. The chemically treated PVC products were exposed to hexane (a 'hard' solvent capable of extracting good amount of DEHP), liquid paraffin (a 'soft' solvent) and blood (with anti-coagulant) for a period 552 h at 28/4 C. The weight loss in these media were determined by drying the solvent-exposed modified PVC product. Unmodified commercially available PVC products were used as control. The amount of loss of plasticizer in the modified and unmodified PVC products are shown below :<br>
a. Treatent with PVC tubes:<br><br><br>
b. Treatment with PVC sheet :<br><br>
During the exposure in the media, the modified materials remain transparent and flexible. The modified materials exposed to hexane and blood did not harden as could be observed in unmodified materials. The modified PVC materials are compatible with blood as the haemolytic potential is within the acceptable limit.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Ininially cleaning of plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) product! is carr5ed out using a non-polar organic solvent for 1-5 minutes Go remove surface - adhered plastlcizers and lubricants etc. followed by cleaning in an ultrasonic cleaner using a detergent solution and deionised water, and then dried at the temperature of 30-70°C for 10-40 h.<br>
II.	Chemical treatment of cleaned and dried PVC product is carried out using a prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane.<br><br>
(a)	An aliphatic prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane was prepared by reacting two component mixture containing component A and component B. Component A is a hydroxyl terminated polyurethane prepolymer and component B is a dtisocyanate. Component A was prepared with the reaction between a cycloaliphatic dtisocyanate and excess polyol having trifunctionallty and nitrogen atom in the presence of a tin catalyst at 70-150°C for a duration of 30-180 min. In an Inert atmosphere using an amide solvent. The resin was dried. This dried resin A was reacted with component B at 40-100°C for a duration of 2-20 min. The resinous prepolymer adhesive was used for coating the PVC product.<br>
(b)	The clean PVC product was dipcoated for l-l0 min using the prepolymer adhesive of polyurethane Immediately after the preparation of prepolymer adhesive. Dipcoatlng was moderated using a ketone solvent.<br>
(c)	Dipcoated products were then cured at 40-120°C for a duration of 10-50 h.<br>
(d)	The chemically modified PVC product is then cleaned in<br>
running water, deionized water and dried at 40-70°C for 1-4<br>
h.<br><br>
Example t<br>
For an experimental   study we used plasticized poly (vinyl  Chloride)   sheet  and tube containing of  30 phr of diethyl  hexyl  phthalate  and 10 phr of dloctyl  adlpate plasticizers.<br>
Calendered   pvc   sheet   (0.35mm thiokness)  and   extruded<br>
PVC tube were chemically treated as detailed above. The coating thickness Is 0.18 mm in each side of a PVC sheet. The chemically treated PVC products were exposed to hexane (a 'hard' solvent capable of extracting good amount of DEHP), liquid paraffin (a 'soft' solvent) and blood (with anti coagxilant) for a period 552 h at 28/4°c. the weight loss in these media were determined by drying the solvenr -exposed modified PVC product.  Unmodified commercially available PvC products were used as control. The amount of loss of plasticizer in the modified and unmodified PVC products are shown below:<br>
a.  Treatment with PVC tubes:<br><br><br>
b. Treatment with PVC sheet:  <br><br>
