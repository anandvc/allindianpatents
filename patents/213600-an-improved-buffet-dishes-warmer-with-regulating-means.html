COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
AN IMPROVED BUFFET DISHE WARMER WITH REGULATING MEANS<br>
MUKESH JAYANTILAL PADHYA of 12, HEM PRABHA BUILDING, CHITTARANJAN ROAD, VILE PARLE (E), MUMBAI - 1400 057, Maharashtra, India, INDIAN national  <br>
The following specification particularly describee the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
AN IMPROVED BUFFET DISHES WARMER WITH LPG GAS AS FUEL AND<br>
REGULATING MEANS<br>
The invention relates to an improved buffet dishes warmer, with LPG as fuel with regulating means. This buffet dish warmer consists of a mini gas cylinder and attachable burner. More particularly the invention relates to a mini gas cylinder which can be attached and detached easily with a compatible burner.<br>
For more than last hundred years naphtha based chemicals are used as fuel under the buffet dishes warmer. These chemicals are toxic, enviromentally non-friendly &amp; not hygienic but considering the need of mobility and the limited space available under the buffet dish, there was no other option available. Some attempts are made recently with electric heaters under the buffet dishes warmer but its mobility is limited to within the proximity of an electric socket. And also there is 6perational inconvenience.<br>
The primary object of these invention is to obviate the aforesaid drawback.<br>
The another object of these invention is to provide an improved buffet dishes warmer with regualting means which can be ef f icently used within the limited . space available and fulfills the need for mobility under the buffet dish.<br>
Another object"of these invention is to provide an improved buffet dishes warmer with regulating means which is effecient, non-toxic, environment friendly and cost effective<br><br>
Looking at all these, the inventor have invented this now mini gas container which can be attached and detached easily with a compatible burner. The container is mostly same as conventional container except that it has on its mouth a   typical brass nut Jon which our burner can be attached see the enclosed diagram. The volume of the container is also critically calculated as 75 to 80 grams of gas is required to keep the food hot in the average size buf f et di.sh. So the volume of the container is kept 250ml.<br>
Our biggest challenge was to make a system that operates properly and fits in the limited space available under the buffet dish. Pressurised gas is very volatile, and it is very difficult to tame it and get the required smooth flow of gas. Conventionally, two-stage regulations are used to solve this problem. The first stage of this regulation is by a regulator, which has rubber diaphragam. This type of: regulator need space more than three-quarters of what is available under the buffet dish. So I have invented a new way to partially regulate the gas flow by spring and ball system put in the small bore in the brass pin, which"presses the safety valve pin. For 3mm bore 0.4mm stainless steel spring with proper number of turns and 2 . 5mm stainless steel ball gives proper regulation.( DMC: knob of particular shape is designed to give grip, safety, heat resistance and better look as well as to use as spanner while tightening and - :opening-the screw type fitting for attaching and detaching<br><br>
the burner. This is directly attached to regular needle valve to give second stage regulation. Though the special dimensions were needed to work out according to our size. See in the enclosed diagram.<br>
A seamless mild steel pipe bent as per requirement is braised at the opening of the needle valve. At the other end a jet holder is braised and a burner is attached on the jet-holder. A special nozzle (seperate nozzle) is designed to refill the container so that gas from big container can be filled in our container. This nozzle is connected with commerical 14 kg or 12 kg / container through BIS approved metal wire covered flexible hose pipe (pigtail pipe) and BIS approved Industrial regulator. When the nozzle is pressed on our container it opens outlet for the big cylinder and inlet. for our container and using mouth to mouth kissing to fill the container.<br>
PVC coated wires crates are also designed to store and transport the container such that the crates can be stacked one above another.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved buffet dishes warmer with regulating means comprising a burner (1) positioned over regulating means (2) for gas flow by spring (3) &amp; ball (4) system provided in the small bore (5) in the brass pin (6)   over the safety valve pin (7) ,- said stainless<br><br>
steel spring (3) with suitable number of turns and stainless steel ball (4) regulates the gas. DMC knobs provide safety , heat resistance and better look and used as spanner for tightening &amp; opening the burner by screwing means; the said burner is attached on the jet holder (9) through a needle valve (10) and mild steel pipe connection.<br>
The invention will now be describe with reference to figure 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 is the top view of an improved buffet dishes warmer"s  burner with regulating means.<br>
Figure 2 is the bottom view of an improved buffet dishes warmer"s burner with regulating means.<br>
Figure 3 is the side view of an improved buffet dishes warmer"s burner with regulating means.<br>
Figure 4 is cross section view of mouth of cylinder with typical brass nut.<br>
Figure 5 is cross section of Refilling nozzle.<br>
Referring to figure 1 to 5 the buffet dishes warner are provided with regulating means and a burner for slow release of LPG gas. The burners are connected in tandom with<br><br>
flexible pipe connection so that it is flexible as well continous fuel supply through a pipe connection. (The regulating means opens the outlets of the cylinder &amp; inlet do the small gas container when the nozzel is pressed) . A seamless mild steel pipe bent as per requirement is braised at the opening of the needle valve. At the other end a jet-holder is braised and a burner is attached on the jet holder.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many-modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br>
I  CLAIM :<br>
An improved buffet dishes warmer with regulating means comprising a burner (1) positioned over regulating means (2) for gas flow by spring (3) &amp; ball (4) system provided in the small bore (5) in the brass pin (6) over the safety valve pin (7) ; said stainless steel spring (3) with suitable number of turns and stainless- steel ball (4) regulates the gas; a DMC knob of particular shape is designed to give grip, safety, heat resistance and better look as well used as spanner for tightening &amp; opening the: burner by screwing means; the said burner is attached on the jet holder (9) through a needle valve (10) and mild steel pipe connection.<br>
