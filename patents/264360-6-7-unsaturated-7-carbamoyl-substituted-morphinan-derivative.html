				<td>DESCRIPTION 6,7-UNSATURATED -7-CARBAMOYL-SUBSTITUTED MORPHINAN DERIVATIVE<br>
[Technical field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a 6,7-unsaturated-7-carbamoyl-substutaed morphinan derivatives, which are useful as an agent for treating and/or preventing nausea, emesis, vomiting and/or constipation, particularly as an agent for alleviating and/or preventing a side effect (emesis, vomiting and/or constipation etc.) induced by a compound having the opioid receptor (e.g. opioid µ receptor) agonistic activity.<br>
[Background Art] [0002]<br>
An opioid receptor agonist such as morphine and the like which is used as an analgesic is very effective in a patient having cancer pain, but as a side effect, induces severe nausea, emesis, vomiting, constipation, anuresis, and itching. Various antiemetics and anti-constipation agents are clinically used, but it can not be said that any of them exhibits the sufficient effect, and an excellent side effect alleviating agent is also demanded for improving QOL of a patient.<br>
Patent Literatures 1 and 2, and Non-patent Literature 1 describe to the effect that a morphinan derivative is effective in treating or preventing emesis and vomiting induced by an opioid µ agonist, and Non-Patent Literature 2 describes that a 6,7-saturated~7-carbamoyl-sbustituted-morphinan derivatives have the opioid 5 receptor antagonism.    However, none of them describes or suggests the present compound.<br>

These reactions may be performed by the same methods as those of the second step and the first step in A process, respectively.    In an amidation step, the reaction may be performed, if necessary, in the presence of a condensing agent<br>
(N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N-dimethylaminopropyl-N'-ethylcarbodiimide, diethyl phosphoryl cyanide, diphenyl phosphoryl azide etc.).<br>

(Second step)<br>
The thus obtained compound (VIII) is subjected to the known substituent introducing reaction to obtain compound (IX). (Third step, Fourth step and Fifth step)<br>
The compound (IX) is hydrolyzed, amidated, and deprotected by the same methods as those of the second step in B process,, the second step in A process and the first step in A step, respectively, to obtain objective the compound (Ic).<br>
In addition, when R4 of the objective compound (I) is lower alkyl, an etherization reaction may be performed at an arbitrary stage as described above. (D process)<br>
