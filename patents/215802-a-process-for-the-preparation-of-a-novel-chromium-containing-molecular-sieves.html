				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a. chromium-containing molecular sieve. More particularly, the invention relates to the preparation of crystalline, mesoporous chromium silicate molecular sieve having chromium as a part of the mesoporous structure belonging to M-41S family, used as a sorbent or a catalyst component.<br>
An amorphous and paracrystalline materials (porous inorganic solids) have been used for many years in industrial applications. Typical examples of these materials are the amorphous silicas commonly used in the catalysts formulations and the paracrystalline transitional aluminas used as solid acid catalysts and petroleum reforming catalyst supports. The size of the pores in amorphous and paracrystalline materials fall into a regime called the mesoporous range (1.3 to 20 nm).<br>
Recently, it was observed that the most regular preparations of the preferred material (silicate analogs of MCM-41) of the invention gives a hexagonal array uniform pores, the x-ray diffraction pattern of which shows a few distinct maxima in the extreme low angle region. The x-ray diffraction pattern, however, is not always a sufficient indicator of the presence of these materials, as the degree of regularity in the microstructure and the extent of repetition of the structure within individual particles affect the number of peaks observed. Indeed, preparations with only one distinct peak in the low angle region of the x-ray diffraction pattern have been found to contain substantial amounts of the material of the invention. In this preferred arrangement, the porosity of the crystalline material of the invention is provided by a hexagonal arrangement of pore channels, a property that can be readily observed by electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.<br>
In the prior art, chromium substituted zeolites have been prepared. For example, US Patent Appl. No. 133, 372 (Dec. 1987) and European Patent application no. 321,177 (Dec. 1988) (both to UOP, Inc) teach treatment of a parent aluminosilicate zeolite with ammonium fluoride salt of tin or chromium. Extraction of aluminum from the framework and insertion of Cr or Sn by secondary synthesis process are described in these patents.<br>
Various attempts have been made to substitute chromium into a zeolite framework via primary synthesis methods but none have been truly successful so far. Attempts to synthesize zeolites particularly of the pentasil family (ZSM-5 like) with a number of ions other than aluminum have been made. Dwyer et al. in US Patent No. 3,941,871 describe the presence of Sn in place of or as a part of the organic template in a ZSM-5 type of a structure but not as a part of the ZSM-5 framework structure itself. In US Patent No. 4, 329, 328 (McAnespic et al.) the synthesis of stannosilicate is suggested but no example of such a synthesis is given nor any properties of such materials are suggested. It was presumed that tin is not a part of the zeolite framework in primary synthesis products because at high pH conditions required for such synthesis, it is probably that tin or such metals precipitate as oxides and/or hydrous oxides much before their crystallization linking with Si-O species to form microporous material wherein tin or such metals become a part of the zeolite framework.<br>
The precipitation of metals such as tin, iron, chromium, etc., in alkaline solution can be prevented by complexing it with oxo-anions like the oxalates, citrates, EDTA and tartarates. It is feasible to prevent the polymerization and precipitation of these ions (as hydroxides, oxo-hydroxides or oxides) in basic media, provided these ions are<br><br>
suitably complexed with appropriate ligands. This factor is important in the primary synthesis procedure which is carried out in aqueous, alkaline medium under hydrothermal conditions. It is crucial to prevent the precipitation of the oxo/hydroxide complexed under such conditions and facilitate the incorporation of ions such as Cr possibly in the framework of the zeolite/molecular sieve.<br>
Mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-41) reported in the prior-art were prepared using aluminium (R.B. Borade and A. Clearfield, Catal. Lett., 1995, 31, 267), iron (Zhong Yuan et al., J. Chem. Commun., 1995, 973), titanium (A. Corma et al., j. Chem. Soc. Chem.. Commun., 1994, 147.) and vanadium (K.M. Redy et al, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1994, 1059) and tin (Japan Kr. Das et al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1995, 2495) ions.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide a process for the preparation of chromium containing mesoporous molecular sieve which prevents the precipitation of the oxo/hydroxide complexes under such conditions and facilitate the incorporation of ions such as Cr possibly in the framework of the zeolite. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a process for the preparation of a novel chromium containing molecular sieve having a chemical composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides by the formula:<br>
