				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a casting mould produced from an age-hardenable<br>
copper alloy.<br>
The universal goal, especially of the steel industry, is to cast wrought<br>
products as closely as possible to final dimensions, in order to<br>
economise on the hot and/or cold forming steps, has lead since about<br>
1980 to a series of developments, for example in one- and two-roll<br>
continuous casting method.<br>
During these casting methods, very high surface temperatures arise on<br>
the water-cooled cylinders or rolls for the casting of alloy steels, nickel,<br>
copper as well as alloys, which can be hot rolled only with difficulty, in<br>
the casting-in zone of the melt. These lie, for example for the casting of<br>
an alloy steel close to the final dimensions, at 350°C to 450°C, in which<br>
the cast rolling casing is of a CuCrZr-material with an electrical<br>
conductivity of 48 Sm/mm2 and caloric conductivity of approximately<br>
320 W/mK. Materials based on CuCrZr were previously used primarily<br>
for thermally high demanding continuously cast ingot moulds and<br>
casting wheels. The surface temperature is reduced to about 150°C to<br>
200°C just before the casting-in zone for these materials by the cooling<br>
of the casting rollers cyclically for each rotation. On the other hand, it<br>
remains to a large extent constant at about 30°C to 40°C on the cooled<br>
rear side of the casting rollers during the rotation. The temperature<br>
gradient between the surface and the rear side in combination with the<br>
cyclical alteration of the surface temperature of the casting rollers<br>
cause thermal stresses in the surface area of the casing material.<br>
According to investigations of the fatigue behaviour on the previously<br>
used CuCrZr-material at different temperatures with a strain amplitude<br>
of ± 0.3% and a frequency of 0.5 Hertz - these parameters correspond<br>
approximately to the rotational speed of the casting rollers of 30 RPM -,<br><br>
under most favourable conditions a life of 3000 cycles can be expected<br>
before the formation of cracks for a maximum surface temperature, for<br>
example, of 400 °C, corresponding to a wall thickness of 25 mm above<br>
the water-cooling. Therefore, the casting rollers have to be reworked<br>
already after a relatively short operation time of about 100 minutes, for<br>
the purpose of remedying the surface cracks. Moreover, the life between<br>
the reworks is essentially dependent, among others, on the<br>
effectiveness of the lubricant/stripping agent at the casting surfaces,<br>
the constructional and process-required cooling as well as the casting<br>
rate. The casting machine must be stopped and the casting cycle<br>
interrupted for changing the casting rollers.<br>
A further disadvantage of the field-proven CuCrZr ingot mould material<br>
is the relatively low hardness of about 110 HBW to 130 HBW. But it is<br>
not possible to avoid the splashes from reaching the roller surface<br>
before the casting-in region in the case of a one- or two-roller<br>
continuous casting process. Then, the solidified steel particles are<br>
pressed into the relatively soft surfaces of the casting rollers, whereby<br>
the surface quality of the cast strips is considerably affected from about<br>
1.5 mm to 4 mm thickness.<br>
Also, the lower electrical conductivity of a standard CuNiBe-alloy with<br>
an addition of up to 1 % niobium leads to a higher surface temperature<br>
in comparison to a CuCrZr-alloy. Since the electrical conductivity is<br>
approximately proportional to the caloric conductivity, the surface<br>
temperature in the casing of a casting roller made from CuNiBe-alloy is<br>
raised to about 540 °C in comparison to a casting roller with a casing<br>
of CuCrZr with a maximum temperature of 400 °C at the surface and<br>
30 °C on the rear side.<br>
Although ternary CuNiBe- or CuCoBe-alloys have basically a Brinell<br>
hardness of above 200 HBW. however the electrical conductivity of the<br><br>
standard wrought products out of these materials, like for example<br>
rods for the production of resistance welding electrodes or plates and<br>
strips for the production of springs or lead frames, reach at the most<br>
values lying in the range of 26 Sm/mm2 to about 32 Sm/mm2. Under<br>
optimum conditions, only a surface temperature of about 585 °C would<br>
be attained on the casing of a casting roller with these standard<br>
materials.<br>
Also, there are no indications that conductivity values of &gt; 38 Sm/mm2<br>
can be attained in combination with a minimum hardness of 200 HBW<br>
with the targeted selection of the alloy components for the CuCoBeZr-<br>
or CuNiBeZr-alloys, as fundamentally known from the US-patent<br>
4,179,314.<br>
Further, the use of an age-hardenable copper alloy consisting of 1.0 %<br>
to 2.6 % nickel that can be partially or totally replaced by cobalt, 0.1 %<br>
to 0.45 % beryllium, 0.05 % to 0.25 % zirconium as desired and, if<br>
necessary, maximum 0.15 % of at least one element from the group<br>
consisting of niobium, tantalum, vanadium, titanium, chromium,<br>
cerium and hafnium, the rest copper, including impurities associated<br>
with the production and the usual processing alloys, with a Brinell<br>
hardness of minimum 200 HBW and an electrical conductivity above<br>
38 Sm/mm2 as material for the production of casting rollers and<br>
casting wheels is considered within the scope of EP 0 548636 Bl, as per<br>
the state-of-art technology.<br>
Alloys with these compositions, like for example the alloys CuCo2Be0.5<br>
or CuNi2Be0.5, have disadvantages of hot formabiliry due to the<br>
relatively high alloying element contents. However, high degree of hot<br>
forming are necessary to achieve a fine-grained product with a grain<br>
size 
structure with a grain size of several millimetres. Till now, sufficiently<br><br>
large cast ingots 01 desired quality coula be produced at very high<br>
expenditure, especially for large sized casting rollers; however hardly<br>
any industrial forming equipments are available to carry out a<br>
sufficiently high hot kneading for the re-crystallisation of the cast<br>
structure to a fine-grained structure with reasonable expenditure.<br>
The invention is based upon the task-starting from the state-of-the-art<br>
technology-to produce an age-hardenable copper alloy as material for<br>
the production of cast moulds, which is insensitive to changing<br>
temperature requirements even at high casting rates or has a high<br>
fatigue resistance at the working temperature for a mould.<br>
This task is solved by an age-hardenable copper alloy according to the<br>
instant invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a casting mould produced from an<br>
age-hardenable copper alloy made of expressed, in each case, in % by weight<br>
0.4% to 2.0% cobalt, which can be partly replaced by up to 0.6% nickel, 0.1% to<br>
0.5% beryllium, 0.03% to 0.5% zirconium, 0.005% to 0.1% magnesium and<br>
optionally a maximum of 0.15% of at least one element from the group<br>
comprising niobium, manganese, tantalum, vanadium, titanium, chromium,<br>
cerium and hafnium, the remainder copper comprising production-related<br>
impurity and conventional processing additives, wherein the casting mould is<br>
produced within a time period of 4 to 32 hours by the processing steps of<br>
casting, hot working, solution annealing at 850°C to 980°C, cold working up to<br>
30% and age-hardening at 400°C to 550°C and in an age-hardened state of the<br>
copper alloy, the casting mould has an average grain size of 30 urn to 500 urn to<br>
ASTM E 112, a hardness of at least 185 HBW, a conductivity between 30 and<br>
36 Sm/mm2, a 0.2% yield point of at least 450 MPa and an elongation at break<br>
of at least 12%.	<br><br>
The instant invention provides for an age-hardenable copper alloy<br>
comprising of 0.4 % to maximum 2 % by weight of cobalt, which can<br>
be partially replaced by nickel, 0.1% to 0.5 % by weight of beryllium,<br>
0.03 % to 0.5% by weight of zirconium, 0.005% to 0.1% by weight of<br>
magnesium and, if necessary, maximum 0.15 % by weight of at least<br>
one element from the group consisting of niobium, manganese,<br>
tantalum, vanadium, titanium, chromium, cerium and hafnium, the<br>
rest being copper and the usual impurities associated with the<br>
production and the processing of the alloys, as a material for the<br>
production of cast moulds.<br>
On the one hand, a still sufficient hardenability of the material is<br>
ensured for the attainment of a higher strength, hardness and<br>
conductivity by the use of a CuCoBeZr(Mg)-alloy with selectively low<br>
graded Co- and Be-content. On the other hand, only low degrees of hot<br>
forming are required for the complete re-crystallisation of the cast<br><br>
structure and conversion  to a fine-grained structure with sufficient<br>
plasticity.<br>
Thanks to this type of material produced for a mould, it is possible to<br>
step up the casting rate to more than double the conventional rate.<br>
Besides, a visibly improved surface quality of the cast strip is achieved.<br>
Also, a considerably longer life of the mould is ensured. By moulds are<br>
understood not only stationary moulds, like e.g. plate- or tubular<br>
moulds, but also revolving ingot moulds, like, for example, casting<br>
rollers.<br>
A further improvement of the mechanical properties of the mould,<br>
especially an increase of the tensile strength, can be achieved<br>
advantageously by the copper alloy containing 0.03 % to 0.35 %<br>
zirconium and 0.005 % to 0.05 % magnesium.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the copper alloy contains a<br>
proportion of 
0.3 % zirconium.<br>
It is further advantageous if the ratio of cobalt to beryllium lies between<br>
2 and 15 in the copper alloy.<br>
Especially, this ratio of cobalt to beryllium amounts to 2.2 to 5.<br>
As per the invention it is permissible to have copper alloy containing up<br>
to 0.6 % nickel, besides cobalt.<br>
Further improvements of the mechanical properties of the mould can<br>
be achieved if, the copper alloy contains up to maximum 0.15% of at<br>
least one element from the group comprising niobium, manganese,<br>
tantalum, vanadium, titanium, chromium, cerium and hafnium.<br><br>
The mould is produced advantageously through the processing steps of<br>
casting, hot forming, solution annealing at 850° C to 980° C, cold<br>
forming up to 30 % as well as hardening at 400 °C to 550 °C within a<br>
period of 2 to 32 h, whereby it has a maximum average grain size of 1.5<br>
mm as per ASTM E 112, a hardness of minimum 170 HBW and an<br>
electrical conductivity of minimum 26 Sm/mm2.<br>
It is especially advantageous if the mould, exhibits in the hardened<br>
condition an average grain size of 30 μm to 500 μm as per ASTM E 112,<br>
a hardness of minimum 185 HBW, a conductivity between 30 and 36<br>
Sm/mm2, a 0.2 % proof stress of minimum 450 Mpa and a breaking<br>
elongation of minimum 12 %.<br>
The copper alloy as per the invention is suitable, especially for the<br>
production of the casing of casting rollers of a double roll casting plant,<br>
which are subject to a changing temperature requirement under high<br>
rolling pressure for the casting close to the final dimensions of strips<br>
made from nonferrous metals, especially strips out of aluminium or<br>
aluminium alloys.<br>
In this case, each casing can be provided with a diathermancy reducing<br>
coating. Furthermore, this can improve the product quality of the strip,<br>
cast out of a nonferrous metal, however especially out of aluminium or<br>
an aluminium alloy. The coating, depending on the operational<br>
behaviour of the casing made from a copper alloy with especially an<br>
aluminium strip, is formed as follows. An adhesion layer is formed at<br>
the beginning of a casting and rolling process from the combination of<br>
copper with aluminium on the surface of the casing, from which<br>
aluminium penetrates into the copper surface during the further<br>
course of the casting process and thereby forms a stable robust<br>
diffusion layer, whose thickness and property are essentially<br><br>
determined by the casting speed and cooling conditions. This improves<br>
the surface quality of the aluminium band and consequently the<br>
product quality is unambiguously improved.<br>
The invention is explained in detail below. Based on the seven alloys<br>
(alloys A to G) and three alloys for comparison (H to J), it is shown how<br>
critical the composition is to achieve the combination of properties<br>
strived for.<br>
All alloys were molten in a crucible furnace and cast into round ingots<br>
of same form. The composition in percentage by weight is given in the<br>
following Table 1. The addition of magnesium serves for the pre-<br>
deoxidation of the melt and the zirconium addition operates positively<br>
on the hot-plasticity.<br><br><br>
The alloys were subsequently pressed to flat bars with a low pressing<br>
ratio	(= cross-section of the ingots / cross-section of the pressing<br>
bar) of 5.6:1 on an extruder at 950 °C. Thereafter, the alloys were<br>
subject to a minimum of 30 minute solution annealing above 850 °C<br>
followed by a water quenching and subsequently hardened for 2 to 32 h<br>
in the temperature range between 400 °C and 550 °C. The<br>
combinations of properties shown in the Table 2 below were achieved.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the combination of properties, the alloys as per the<br>
invention achieve, especially for the production of a casing of a cast<br>
roller, the re-crystallised fine-grained structure with the relevant<br>
desired high breaking elongation. The reference alloys H to J have a<br>
grain size of over 1.5 mm, because of which the plasticity of the<br>
material is reduced.<br>
An additional increase in strength can be achieved by cold forming<br>
before hardening. In the following Table 3, combination of properties<br>
are again given for the alloys A to J, which are attained by solution<br>
annealing of the pressed material for minimum 30 minutes at above<br>
850 °C followed by water quenching, 10 % to 15 % cold rolling (cross<br>
sectional reduction) and finally hardening for 2 to 32 hours in the<br>
temperature range between 400 "C and 550 °C.<br><br><br>
The alloys A to G as per the invention once again show higher breakage<br>
elongation and a grain size below 0.5 mm, while the reference alloys H<br>
to J have a coarse grain with a grain size above 1.5 mm and lower<br>
breakage elongation values. Consequently, these copper alloys have<br>
definite processing advantages for the production of casings, especially<br>
for larger cast rollers of double roll casting plants, whereby it is<br>
possible to produce a fine-grained end product with optimum basic<br>
properties for the range of application.<br><br>
