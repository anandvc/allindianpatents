A POINT FIXED CURTAIN WALL HANGING SYSTEM<br>
A point-fixed curtain wall hanging system comprises: a plurality of pole members, being long<br>
straight poles and connected to each other to form a plurality of hanging poles fixed vertically<br>
on the portions of a building close to a rib-board or a panel-board of a curtain wall; a plurality<br>
of support members fixed on the top portions of said hanging poles and fastened on a curtain<br>
wall support structure; and a plurality of hanging members fixed between two said pole<br>
members and connecting said pole members to each other to form said hanging poles. Due to<br>
adopting the above structure, and adopting the hanging system described in the present<br>
invention to install the glass curtain wall, the panel-board and the rib-board are both hanged to<br>
form the curtain wall and bear the pull force, more satisfying the theory of the optimization of<br>
the mechanics and meeting the requirements for the safety and the stability.</td>
