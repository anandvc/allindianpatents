				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to wind turbine blade shell members comprising cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of manufacturing a wind turbine blade shell member comprising cured fibre-reinforced sheet material near an outer surface, preferably with the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material arranged as partially overlapping tiles.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a wind turbine blade shell member and a wind turbine blade comprising cured fibre-reinforced sheet material bonded by cured resin and a sub-assembly related to the method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
WO03/008800 discloses a blade for a wind turbine, which blade comprises a layer of pre-fabricated sticks near the shell surface. In one embodiment, some of the sticks consist of carbon fibre pultrusions positioned in the blade with the cross section of the stick substantially orthogonal to the outer surface of the blade.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a more efficient method of manufacturing a composite member.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a composite member comprising cured fibre-reinforced sheet material bonded by cured resin.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above and other objects of the invention are realised by a method of manufacturing a wind turbine blade shell member comprising the steps of providing a mould, positioning a plurality of elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material in the mould. Thereafter, a curable resin is introduced between most of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material, and the plurality of elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is bonded by curing of the resin. An outer surface layer material and/or an inner surface layer material may furthermore optionally be provided in the mould prior to introduction and curing of the resin.<br>
The number of elements may vary considerably dependent on the actual application, such as the thickness, shape and size of the elements, the size of the wind turbine blade shell member to be manufactured. Typically, more at least 3 elements are used, but when more, such as at least 5, at least 10 or at least 15 elements are used, a more even overall shape of the completed reinforcement structure may be achieved. On the other hand, a very high number of elements may be difficult to organise. Even if more layers may be used within the invention, It is therefore typically preferred to use less than 100 elements, such as less than 75 or less than 50 elements. When a large number of elements are used, it is preferred that the elements are arranged In sub-assembly-like structures, such as stacks, which may be temporarily secured to each other form a loose stack.<br>
The use of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material aliows for very high fibre content and highly aligned fibres in the elements. It is known in the art that bending or humps of fibres (n a fibre-reinforced composite material greatly degrade the mechanical properties, particularly the strength and E-modulus, of the composite. Manufacturing of composites with highly aligned fibres is therefore very desirable. Furthermore, the fact that the sheet is cured facilitates transportation of the elements, as no special conditions, such as temperature range or humidity range, are required. In addition, the combination of the sheet shape with the cured stale of the element facilitates adjustment of the elements to the shape of the mould without compromising the alignment, or in other words the straightness, of the fibres in the member.. This is particularly important to complex shapes such as an airfoil of wind turbine blade, where the desired fibre distribution is a complicated three-dimensional shape.<br>
In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, at least some of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material are positioned as partially overlapping tiles so<br>
that a number of substantially parallel element edges are provided This allows for positioning of the elements very close to the surface of the mould, and by adjusting the overlapping area between elements, almost any desired overall distribution of reinforcing fibres may be realised. Particularly, the elements may be positioned in a cross section of a wind turbine blade so that the fibres substantially resemble the distribution of water in a lake having a depth profile corresponding to the distance from the centreline of the blade to the surface of the cross section. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the substantially parallel element edges are edges, which are substantially parallel to the length of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material This leads to a relatively short resin Introduction distance and hence easier manufacturing and greater reproducibility.<br>
The elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may be provided along a shorter or a larger fraction of the length of the composite structure. However, It is typically preferred that the elements are positioned along at least 75% of the length of the wind turbine blade shell member, and In many cases It is more preferred that the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is positioned along at least 90% of the length of the composite structure.<br>
The cured fibre-reinforced sheet material comprises fibres, such as carbon fibres, glass fibres, aramid fibres, natural fibres, such as cellulose-based fibre like wood fibres, organic fibres or other fibres, which may be used for reinforcement purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the fibres are unidirectional fibres oriented parallel to the length of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. This provides for very high strength and stiffness In the length of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. Other orientations or combinations of orientations may be suitable in some applications. Examples of other suitable orientations are bi-axial fibres oriented at ±45" or Oa/90" relative to the length of the sheet material; and trlaxial fibres oriented at ±45° and in the length of the sheet material. Such orientations increase the edgewise and/or twisting strength and stiffness of the composite material.<br>
Furthermore, the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material comprises a resin, preferably a thermosetting resin, such as an epoxy-based, a vinyl ester-based resin, a polyurethane-based or another suitable thermosetting resin.<br>
The cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may comprise more than one type of resin and more than one type of fibres. In a preferred embodiment, the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material compn'ses unidirectional carbon fibres and an epoxy-based resin or a vinyl ester-based resin, preferably the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material consist substantially of unidirectional carbon fibres and an epoxy-based resin.<br>
The cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is a relatively flat member having a length, which is at least ten times the width, and a width, which is at least 5 times the thickness of the sheet material. Typically, the length is 20 - 50 times the width or more and the width is 20 to 100 times the thickness or more., In a preferred embodiment, the shape of the sheet material is band-like.<br>
It is preferred that the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is dimensioned such that it is coilable. By coilable is meant that the sheet material may be coiled onto a roll having a diameter that allows for transportation in standard size containers. This greatly reduces the manufacturing cost of the composite member, as endless coils of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may be manufactured at a centralised facility and shipped to the blade assembly site, where it may be divided into elements of suitable size. To further enhance shipping, it is preferred that the thickness of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is chosen so that the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may be coiled onto a roll with a diameter of less than 2 m based on the flexibility, stiffness, fibre type and fibre content utilised. Typically, this corresponds to a thickness up to 3.0 mm, however, for high fibre contents and stiffness, a thickness below 2.5 mrn is usually more suitable. On the other hand, the thick sheet materials provide for rather large steps at the outer surface, which favours the thinner sheet materials. However, the sheet materials should typically not be thinner than 0.5 mm as a large number of sheets then would be needed leading to increased manufacturing time. Experimental work has shown that a thickness of above 1.0 mm provides a good compromise with regard to the number of sheets. Finally, the flexibility of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material should be sufficient for sheet to conform to the shape of the mould. In a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is about 1.5 to 2 mm.<br>
The width of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material typically varies along the length of the sheet material. Typically, the maximum width should be more than 100 mm and to reduce the number of sheets, a width of more than 150 mm is desirable.<br>
Experimental work has shown that in many cases, the width may preferably be more than 200 mm at the widest place. On the other hand, the resin must travel between adjacent sheets in fength corresponding to the width of the sheet and hence the maximum width of the sheet material is preferably less than 500 rnm to allow for suitable control of resin introduction. In a preferred embodiment, the maximum width is less than 400 mm and for example if the resin is selected so that it initiates curing prior to complete infusion, it is preferred that the maximum sheet width is less than about 300 mm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is pre-treated before being positioned in the mould. Examples of pre-treatment is sandblasting, e.g. to increase the mechanical binding with the resin or to change the surface texture (see below), rinsing of the surfaces by mechanical and/or chemical means or acclimatising, e.g. drying or heating. More than one type of pre-treatment of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may be suitable dependent on (he conditions of the use.<br>
The cured fibre-reinforced sheet material should comprise highly aligned fibres and the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may therefore advantageously be a pultruded cured composite material or a belt pressed cured composite. These techniques may provide the desired sheet shapes with a high fibre content of highly aligned fibres. Furthermore, these techniques are particularly suitable for manufacturing of endless lengths of material.<br>
It may be very difficult to Introduce resin between sheets of material if the sheets are positioned very close. This Is particularly the case if the space between the sheets are subjected to vacuum. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is provided with a surface texture to facilitate introduction of resin between adjacent elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The surface texture may comprise resin protrusions of a height above a main surface of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material, preferably in the order of about 0.1 mm to 0,5 mm, but larger protrusions may in some cases, such as when the resin introduction distance is relatively large, be larger.<br>
The surface texture may in addition to this or as an alternative comprise recesses, such as channels into the main surface of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material,<br>
preferably the recesses are in the order of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm below the main surface, but in some cases larger recesses may be suitable. Typically, the protrusions and/or recesses are separated by 1 cm to 2 cm, but the spacing may be wider or smaller dependent on the actual size of the corresponding protrusions and/or recesses.<br>
Surface texture of the types described above may be provided after the manufacturing of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material, e.g. by sand blasting, grinding or dripping of semi-solid resin onto the surface, but it is preferred that the surface texture to facilitate introduction of resin between adjacent elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material at least partially is provided during manufacturing of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. This is particularly easily made when the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is manufactured by belt pressing, as the surface texture may be derived via a negative template on or surface texture of the belt of the belt press. In another embodiment, a foil is provided between the belt and the fibre-reinforced sheet material being formed in the belt press. Such a foil may also act as a liner and should be removed prior to introduction of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material in the mould.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the facilitating effect of surface texture on the resin distribution during resin introduction is realised by providing a plurality of inner spacer elements between adjacent elements of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The inner spacer elements may advantageously be selected from one or more members of the group consisting of a collection of fibres, such as glass fibres and/or carbon fibres, a solid material, such as sand particles, and a high melting point polymer, e.g. as dots or lines of resin. It Is preferred that the inner spacer elements are inert during the resin introduction, and for example does not change shape or react with the introduced resin. Using inner spacer elements may be advantageous in many cases, as it is relatively affordable and does not require any particular method of manufacturing of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material or a special pre-treatment of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The inner spacing elements are preferably in the size range of 0.1 mm to 05 mm and separated by typically 1 cm to 2 cm, but both the sizes and the spaces may be suitable in some cases. Typically, the larger the inner spacing element, the larger the spacing can be allowed.<br>
To facilitate the introduction of resin this process may advantageously be vacuum assisted. In this case, the method further comprises the steps of forming a vacuum<br>
enclosure around the composite structure. The vacuum enclosure may preferably be formed by providing a flexible second mould part in vacuum tight communication with the mould. Thereafter a vacuum may be provided in the vacuum enclosure by a vacuum means, such as a pump in communication with the vacuum enclosure so that the resin may be introduced by a vacuum assisted process, such as vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding, VARTM. A vacuum assisted process is particularly suitable for large structures, such as wind turbine blade shell members, as long resin transportation distances could otherwise lead to premature curing of the resin, which could prevent further infusion of resin.. Furthermore, a vacuum assisted process will reduce the amount of air in the wind turbine blade shell member and hence reduce the presence of air in the infused composite, which increases the strength and the reproducibility.<br>
Composite members according to the invention or manufacturable by the method according to the Invention may either form a wind turbine blade shell individually or form a wind turbine blade shell when connected to one or more further such composite members, e.g. by mechanical fastening means and/or be adhesive. From such wind turbine blade shells, a wind turbine blade may advantageously be manufactured by connecting two such wind turbine blade shells by adhesive and/or mechanical means, such as by fasteners. Both the wind turbine blade shell and the combined wind turbine blade may optionally comprise further elements, such as controlling elements, lightning conductors, etc. In a particularly preferred embodiment, each blade shell consists of a composite member manufacturable by the method according to the invention. In another preferred embodiment, the wind turbine blade shell member manufactured by the method according to the invention forms substantially the complete outer sheli of a wind turbine blade, i.e. a pressure side and a suction side which are formed integrally during manufacturing of the wind turbine blade shell member.<br>
One aspect of the invention concerns a wind turbine blade comprising cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is positioned near the outer surface of the blade as partially overlapping tiles. In a preferred embodiment the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is pultruded or band pressed cured fibre-reinforced sheet material and has been divided into elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a wind turbine blade according to the invention has a length of at least 40 m. The ratio of thickness, t, to chord, C, (t / C) is substantially constant for airfoil sections in the range between 75%

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In Fig. 1 an example of a wind turbine blade shell member 2 formed according to the method of the invention is shown in the mould 4. The mould 4 is typically a rigid member and may be combined with a second mould part (see element 5, Fig., 6) during introduction of resin. Typically such second mould part is flexible. Optionally, an outer surface layer material 10 is positioned in the mould. Such an outer surface layer 10 may e.g. be a prepreg or a thermoplastic coating material. Then a plurality of elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material Is positioned in the mould. Core elements 36, and further elements, such as e.g. a lightning conductor system, a control system and a wind turbine blade monitoring system, may also be provided at this stage.<br>
An optional inner surface layer material 12 may be provided over the elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material if this is desired. The optional inner surface layer material may also be provided after introduction of resin between the elements, but the presence of an inner surface layer material is not essential for the wind turbine blade shell member. An Inner surface layer material as well as an outer surface layer material may comprise fibres, which are oriented differently from the fibres of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material and hence e.g. increase the transverse strength of the wind turbine blade shell member.<br>
Finally, resin is introduced between the elements. It is preferred (hat all the spaces between adjacent elements are filled with the resin, but a partial filling may suffice in some cases. To facilitate Introduction of resin, the air between adjacent elements may be removed prior to introduction of resin, e.g. by vacuum as discussed elsewhere..<br>
In a preferred embodiment exemplified in Fig. 2, the plurality of elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material provided as partially overlapping elements are arranged in at least two layers 14 of elements. In Fig. 2, this is exemplified with two layers 14,<br>
but more layers such as 3, 4, 5, 6 or even more layers may be advantageous for large wind turbine blade shell members having very thick reinforcement structures., The elements in different layers may be oriented similarly (not shown) or differently as shown in Fig. 2 The layers 14 may be separated by a member 34, such as a fibrous layer or surface spacer element 34 (see below), to facilitate distribution of resin and/or to achieve an even base for a subsequent layer.<br>
Resin may be introduced into the layers of elements in one operation or In a stepwise operation, where one or more layers are first infused by resin upon which the resin in these layers are cured prior to introduction of resin into one or more further layers of elements. Such a stepwise method may comprise two or more steps such as 2, 3,4, 5 or even more in cases with very thick overall reinforcement structures.<br>
One of the major advantages of the use of elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is that the reinforcement material may be positioned with very high freedom of design. In general, it is preferred that the reinforcement material is positioned as far away from the centreline of the structure as possible to realise a high momentum of the reinforcement. By using overlapping elements, this may substantially be achieved by a plurality of elements having the same shape or - in situations where a complex geometrical overall reinforcement structure is desired - by a plurality of elements having only a few different shapes. This is possible by varying the degree of overlapping and the angles between the outer surface of the composite surface and the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material.<br>
In Fig. 3, an example of a distribution of elements in a mould illustrates this. The elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material are positioned along the outer surface, and core elements (not shown) may be arranged away from the outermost surfaces to insure a suitable positioning of the elements. Core elements are light structures with limited reinforcing capability. In a preferred embodiment, this is applied for a wind turbine blade so that at least 80%, preferably 90%, of fibres in a cross section of the blade orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the blade are arranged in the combined volume of the outermost volume. It is preferred that the above fraction of fibres is arranged in the outmost 20 or 30 vol-% of the pressure or windward side and the outermost 20 or 30 vol-% of the suction or leeward side. For the semi-profile in Fig 3, the fraction of the outermost part is Indicated with line 16 and the centre plane of the profile is indicated with line 18. This arrangement is highly desirable, as it allows<br>
for increased moment of inertia for a given amount of reinforcement In a preferred embodiment, this distribution of fibres is realised for cross sections in the range of ratios of distance from wind turbine blade root, r, to the total length of the wind turbine blade root, R, of 50% 
The elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may advantageously be prepared by dividing the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material by cutting. Due to the fibrous nature of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material it is preferred to use water jet to prevent dependency on wear of traditional cutting tools, but other methods may also be used within the scope of the invention<br>
In Fig. 5, an example of a method of dividing a band-shaped cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is described. It is desirable to shape the elements so that a relatively sharp tip is formed near at least one end, as a stack of partially overlapping elements will then resemble an overall chamfering of the reinforcement fibre content towards the end. This is particularly the case if the tip of the element is formed by the intercept of two relatively straight edges.<br>
In a preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 5A, at least one of the elements 8 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6 is divided to form a first tip angle a towards a first end 24 corresponding to a first end of the wind turbine blade shell member 2. In a more preferred embodiment, the first tip angle a is formed by dividing the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6 along a straight line indicated in Rg. SA by a broken line from a first sheet edge 20 to the second sheet edge 22 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6. For elongated composite structures, which are supported near one end only such as a wind turbine blade, the momentum increases substantially linearly from the unsupported end towards the supported end. The strength of the elements is substantially proportional to the cross section of the element, and the elements typically account for the major part of the structural strength.. It is therefore highly advantageous that the cross section of the sum of element (also referred to as the overall reinforcement structure) increases substantially linearly from the first tip end., According to the invention, this may easily be realised by utilising individual elements with a first tip angle a, which are formed by dividing the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material along a straight line as discussed above.<br>
Another preferred embodiment is also shown in Fig. 5A. Here, at least one of the elements 8 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6 is divided to form a second tip angle (3 towards a second end 26 corresponding to a second end of the wind turbine blade shell member 2 In a more preferred embodiment, the second tip angle (5 is formed by dividing the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6 along a straight line indicated in Fig. 5A by a broken line from a first sheet edge 20 to the second sheet edge 22 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6. Particularly for elements or sub-assemblies 8 to be applied for manufacturing of a wind turbine blade, it is preferred that the second tip angle p is larger that the first tip angle a<br>
To save cured fibre-reinforced sheet material by avoiding or at least reducing waste, it is preferred that the width of a part of the element or sub-assembly 8 of the cured fibre reinforcement material 6 corresponds to the width of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material.<br>
The elemenl or sub-assembly 8 in Fig. 5 is further advantageous in that identical elements may be formed with no part of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material being wasted during dividing of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The lack of waste may be realised for trapezium-shaped elements (shown in Fig. 5B) as well as triangular elements (shown in Fig- 5C) with a height corresponding to a width 40 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material..<br>
The element 8 is a sub-assembly for the manufacturing of wind turbine blade shell members according to the invention and may be manufactured on-site in close relation to the lay-up and manufacturing of the complete wind turbine blade shell member or the sub-assembly may be manufactured separated from the manufacturing site of the composite structure. The sub-assembly may comprise one or more of the features, which have been described for the elements or for the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material, such as material content, a modified surface texture, an inner surface spacer element secured thereto, method of manufacture, shape and size and thickness under the same considerations. The sub-assembly may be transported fn a stack of flat elements or coiled or bent into a suitable shape. The element sub-assemblies may be integrated into a further sub-assembly comprising a stack of sub-assemblies and optionally further elements, such as adhesive or mechanical fasteners to hold the elements   together   at   least   temporarily.   Both   types   of  sub-assemblies   may advantageously be used for the manufacturing of wind turbine blade shell members as<br>
the flexibility of the sub-assembly suits the requirements to form the three dimensional shape of the blade air foil.<br>
The elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material may be arranged to form a reinforcement structure in various overall shapes Typically, the elements are arranged so as to form a reinforcement structure having one leg towards the first end of the wind turbine blade shell member to be manufactured and one leg towards the second end of the composite structure, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. However, in a preferred embodiment, the elements 8 of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material 6 are positioned in the mould 4 so as to form an overall reinforcement structure, which has at least two legs towards the first end 24 corresponding to a first end of the wind turbine blade shell member and/or at least two legs towards the second end 26 corresponding to a second end of the composite structure.<br>
Fig. 4B to D Illustrate examples of reinforcement structures having more than one leg towards at least one end. In Fig. 4B, the overall reinforcement structure has one leg towards the first end and two legs towards the second end. In Fig. 4C and D, the overall reinforcement structure has two legs towards the first and the second ends. The overall reinforcement structures illustrated in Fig. 4 are particularly advantageous in that - in addition to provide tensile strength - the reinforcement structures provide increased twisting strength and stiffness and/or edgewise strength and stiffness. This is particularly advantageous for long relatively slim structures, such as wind turbine blades and wind turbine blade shell members.<br>
If the elements of different legs overlap in one or more areas, it is preferred that the elements of the legs are interlaced to realise an increased connection between the elements of the individual legs. Such interlacing are particularly easy to realise for wind turbine blade shell members having elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material since the individual elements may be handled without bending the fibres in the elements.<br>
The overall reinforcement structure tends to become very thick in areas where elements of individual legs overlap. This may lead to local bending of the fibres in the elements or inappropriately high resin use in areas adjacent to such overlapping areas to prevent the local bending. Fig, 4D shows a reinforcement structure having a special embodiment of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The elements<br>
are provided with an area corresponding at least partially to the overlapping area, which has a reduced width. Thereby the total thickness of the reinforcement structure in these areas is reduced. In another embodiment, the elements are provided with an area corresponding at least partially to the overlapping area, which has a reduced thickness (not shown in the figures). In general, the embodiment with the reduced width is more preferred, since such elements may easily be prepared by cutting a coil of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material.<br>
The exact positioning of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material in the mould may be facilitated by the use of a template means showing the desired positions. This is particularly the case when more complex systems of elements are desired or if manual lay-up Is utilised. A template means may indicate the relative position of elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material towards an end corresponding to the end of the wind turbine blade shell member and/or indicate the relative position of at least one element relative to the mould, such as a mould edge or a feature of the mould, e g. a hole or a tap. The indication of the correct position may involve the longitudinal position, the width-wise position and/or the height-wise position relative to the mould and/or relative to further elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material or other elements to be included in the composite structure.<br>
The template means may be integrated in the wind turbine blade shell member so that it is a single use template. In a preferred embodiment, the template means is integrated with a core element of the composite structure.<br>
For large elements, such as for a wind turbine blade, where the length of the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material typically is in the order of the total length of the wind turbine blade, it may be advantageous to apply several template means, e.g. one at each end and t, 2, 3 or more on selected positions along the length of the blade.<br>
The elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material are bonded together by resin as discussed above, but during the lay-up, it is highly advantageous to at least temporarily fix the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material to the mould and/or to another element in the mould, e.g. one or more cured fibre-reinforced sheet material element or another type of element. The temporary fixing should be formed so that the fixing does not lead to unacceptable defects during subsequent introduction of resin or during use of the final product. The fixing may for example involve one or<br>
more adhesive, such as a curable or non-curable hot-melt resin or a double-coated tape; or mechanical fastening means, such as a clamp, wires, wires with loops or an elastic member. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the means for temporary fixing are not removed prior to introduction of resin and hence included in the completed composite structure. In this case, it is particularly important that the means for temporary fixing is compatible with the elements of the final structure in both chemical terms (e.g. in relation to the resin) and mechanical terms (eg. no formation of mechanically weak spots).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material are positioned according to two to four, preferably three, templates positioned near the ends and away from the ends. The elements are temporarily fixed in the desired positions by hot melt, which is of the same type as the resin to be introduced to bond the elements and the templates are removed prior to resin introduction.<br>
For a curved mould, such as a cross section of a mould for a wind turbine blade shell member as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the resin may advantageously be introduced between the elements from the convex side. As the rigid mould 4 typically Is convex, this typically leads to resin being introduced through the rigid mould 4 or through the second flexible mould 5 and through the wind turbine blade shell member to near the outer surface. This is mainly due to the spacing between the elements being greater at the convex side than at a concave side as indicated in Fig. 7 by arrows 50 and 52, respectively. Fig 6 shows a preferred route of introducing the resin. Here, the resin is introduced through the second mould 5 via a resin passage 43 in a core element 36 to near the outer mould but other resin transport routes are also feasible. From near the mould surface, the resin Is introduced between the elements 8. In addition to larger access to the space between the elements 8, the introduction of resin from near the mould surface towards the second mould allows for observation of complete resin Introduction during processing as the resin must penetrate to the surface of the wind turbine blade shell member near the second mould Here, the resin may be observed visually, particularly if the second mould part is transparent or transparent windows are provided in the second mould part-In a particularly advantageous arrangement of the structural elements of the mould and the composite to be manufactured shown in Fig. 6, the elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material are arranged partially overlapping starting from a first side of<br>
the mould, e.g. corresponding to leading edge or trailing edge of a wind turbine blade shell member. The resin introduction passage is arranged near the element B of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material away from the first side of the mould, e.g. corresponding to trailing edge or leading edge, respectively. Excess resin may advantageously be extracted near the first side of the mould near the surface of the second mould, corresponding to the leading edge or the trailing edge, respectively. Such an arrangement allows for a relatively straight resin transport, which reduces the likelihood of blocking of the resin distribution route and therefore provides a more robust design.<br>
The elements 8 are relatively flexible in directions orthogonal to the plane of the element 8 and therefore conform to the inner surface of the mould 4 by fiexing. However, the elements 8 are also relatively rigid in directions in the plane of the element 8 and therefore tend to form sharp lines of connection to the mould. Such connections dramatically detain the resin transport transversely to the connection.<br>
It is known to provide flexible open webs near the surface of a composite structure to facilitate resin infusion. However, such flexible webs would be substantially without effect when the elements are relatively rigid as in this case, as flexible webs simply would be deformed by the high local pressure exercised by the edge of the elements 8. The inventor has realised that in such cases, the surface spacer element 34 should also be rigid. Experimental work has shown that a composite material having an open structure, such as a grid or a grill, and comprising fibres and fully cured resin will be able to maintain the resin transport transversely the connection between the edges of the elements 8 and the mould 4. It has been found that a composite consisting of a cured glass fibre-reinforced grid or other open structure provides a particularly advantageous structure for a surface spacer element, as the glass fibres are very affordable and relatively thick. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cured grid is an open blax structure., The grid may advantageously be oriented relative to the edges of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material so that the edges are not parallel to any of the biax directions as this reduces the likelihood of accidental blockage of resin transport under the edges via the surface spacer element.<br>
In addition to facilitating resin transport, the surface spacer material may also contribute to the mechanical strength of the composite structure, particularly with respect to the strength orthogonal to the main direction of the reinforcement fibres of<br>
the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. This is mainly due to the fact that the fibres of the surface spacer material typically are positioned in a non-parallel arrangement relative to the main direction of the reinforcement fibres of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. Typical and preferred orientation of a biax surface spacer material is ±45" relative to the main direction of the reinforcement fibres of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material<br>
The flexibility of the element 8 decreases as the thickness of the element is increased. Furthermore, the steps between the edges of the individual element increase as the thickness of the elements are increased. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, where a stack of partially overlapping elements 8 of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material is schematically shown. In Fig. 8A, two stacks are shown, the stack to the left having thick elements 8 and the stack to the right having thin elements 8. It is observed that the triangular space 38 between the elements and an outer mould is larger for the thick elements 8 than for the thin elements 8. This may lead to a wavy outer surface texture of completed wind turbine blade shell member as shown in Fig. 8B, e.g. due to curing shrinkage of the resin or thermal contraction based on differences in thermal expansion and/or flexibility of the resin filling the triangular spaces 38 and other elements in the completed composite structure.<br>
In Fig. 80, it is illustrated how a cured material, such as a surface spacer element as described above, may diminish or remove the tendency to form a wavy outer surface texture by decreasing the dependency of the surface characteristics on the properties of the resin and the thickness of the elements.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the plurality of elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material comprises at least two types of fibres. The fibres are preferably selected from the group consisting of carbon fibres, glass fibres, aramid fibres and natural fibres, such as cellulose-based fibres, preferably wood fibres.<br>
The fibres may be arranged so that one or more of the elements comprises two or more types of fibres, such as e.g. a combination of carbon fibres with wood fibres or carbon fibres with glass fibres. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the plurality of elements comprises a first group of elements, which has a first fibre composition, and a second group of elements, which has a second composition. Preferably, the first<br>
fibre composition consists substantially of carbon fibres so that the first group of<br>
elements is particularly stiff relative to the weight and volume of the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material. The second fibre composition may e.g.. comprise wood fibres and/or glass fibres. More than two groups of elements may be present, such as three, four, five, six or even more groups.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the shape of the elements is similar for a]] elements Irrespective of the group it belongs to. In another embodiment, the shapes of elements that belong to different groups are dissimilar. In a third embodiment, the shape of elements varies within an individual group of elements.<br>
Preferred combinations of elements are<br>
a)	a group of elements reinforced by carbon fibres in combination with a group of<br>
elements reinforced by glass fibres;<br>
b)	a group of elements reinforced by carbon fibres in combination with a group of<br>
elements reinforced by wood fibres;<br>
c)	a group of elements reinforced by carbon fibres in combination with a group of<br>
elements reinforced by glass fibres and a group of elements reinforced by wood<br>
fibres.<br>
These groups are particularly useful for manufacturing of elements for wind turbine blade shells, as the reinforcement requirements including stiffness and strength requirements vary with the distance from the blade root A combination of this type utilising the cured fibre-reinforced sheet material technology according to the present invention will therefore provide a structurally superior and affordable blade.<br>
The elements of the groups may be positioned in the mould or the final product so that at least some of the elements of two groups are arranged end to end as illustrated in Fig. 9A. Here, 'c1 indicates elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material mainly reinforced by carbon fibre, 'g1 indicates elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material mainly reinforced by glass fibres, and V indicates elements of cured fibre-reinforced sheet material mainly reinforced by wood fibres. Only one layer of elements is shown to enhance clarity- In fact may layers will be used for a composite structure, typically each layer is slightly displaced relative to adjacent layers, e.g. as illustrated in Fig. 4 to allow for more gradual changing of properties.<br>
In Fig,. 9B, another preferred arrangement of groups of elements is illustrated. Here, elements of the different groups partially overlap adjacent groups. The overlapping may cover only a small fraction of the area of an element or be a substantially complete overlap. It is preferred that the width of the element in overlapping areas are gradually reduced to provide more gradual change in properties of the overall reinforcement structure. The number of elements need not be the same for all groups. For example are fewer elements with carbon fibres than elements with wood fibres or glass fibre typically required, as elements with carbon fibre are stiffer than the other and typically are arranged in narrow part of the structure.<br>
An individual feature or combination of features from an embodiment of the invention described herein, as well as obvious variations thereof, is combinable with or exchangeable for features of the other embodiments described herein, unless the person skilled in the art would immediately realise that the resulting embodiment is not physically feasible.<br><br>
