The present invention relates to an illumination apparatus used for mobile electronic equipment -such as a mobile telephone and a pager and others, particularly relates to an illumination apparatus composed so that a liquid crystal display for displaying a character, a mark and others is illuminated with using plural luminous elements different in a wavelength.<br>
A conventional type mobile telephone is disclosed in JP-A-5-136728, the display of which has means for notifying by cyclically sequentially switching light sources respectively having at least two types of self-luminous colors for lighting a display as means other than means for notifying by a ringer to send a ring tone from a sounding body such as a loud speaker and a piezoelectric buzzer. Also, means for informing a user of the working condition of equipment by notifying only the change of luminescent color is disclosed in JP-A-6-204910.<br>
For structure for lighting a display, a liquid crystal display (LCD) in which a light conducting plate having a curved surface for conducting light from a light emitting diode (LED) is built and others are disclosed in JP-A-9-203899.<br>
However, in the configuration, as means for uniformly<br><br>
lighting a character, a mark or the periphery respectively displayed on the display is not disclosed though the display can be lighted, it can be notified to a user only that light-source colors are switched or a user can recognize only that luminescent colors are switched and there is a problem that displayed character, mark and others can be definitely read.<br>
Particularly, the display of a mobile telephone is provided with a function for displaying a telephone number and others of an originator when a call is received, however, as a character cannot be precisely read in case lighted light has some grades in density on the screen,"a character, a mark, a digit and others respectively displayed so that they are notified to a user and are read by the user may be prevented from being read because of the irregular color of lighted light. Further, in case the display which is also a part of the appearance of the equipment has irregular color, the appearance quality may be deteriorated. The problem of irregular color can be avoided in case luminous elements are continuously provided, however, in case multiple luminous elements are used, the cost is increased. The display of a mobile telephone is manufactured so that it has the width of approximately 30 to 50 mm to enable operation by one hand. However, in case the" display having the width is lighted by one body of luminous elements, it is warped. Normally, devices are mounted on a printed board by surface mounting by a reflow,<br><br>
however, in case a device is warped, a defective part of soldering occurs and normal mounting is disabled.<br>

side of the flexible board 21 and the springs 24 respectively corresponding to the contacts 25 are also arranged so that they are symmetrical.<br>
For the body of luminous elements 23, a first luminous element that emits light having a first wavelength (a luminous element may be also called a light emitting diode), a second luminous element that emits light having a second wavelength and a third luminous element that emits light having a third wavelength respectively by energizing the luminous elements are held with resin by one piece.

The body of luminous elements 23 is housed in the holding member 22 and the periphery of the body of luminous elements 23 is touched to the printed board 9 to prevent light radiated from the body of luminous elements 23 from leaking out through clearance between the body of luminous elements and the printed board 9. The liquid crystal display 6 attached to the printed board 9 is housed in the body, the opening 14 for enabling a character, a mark, a digit and others displayed on the liquid-crystal display 19 to be seen from the outside is provided in the body and further, the opening 14 is covered with the transparent window 15. A cushion 31 in the shape of a hollow square is provided between the liquid crystal display 6 and the upper case 1 to prevent dust and others from invading on the liquid crystal display 6 from the outside.<br>
Next, the configuration for irradiating the liquid crystal display 6 will be described in detail. Fig. 3 is a local longitudinal section showing the liquid crystal display 6 and in this case, the body of luminous elements 23 formed by integrating plural luminous elements is" arranged along one side of the liquid-crystal display 19, light emitted from all the luminous elements is incident on an incident part A provided to the same<br><br>
position and is reflected in a reflecting part 30 so that the unevenness of the luminance of an irradiated part can be removed by utilizing the same light conducting means.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 3, light radiated from the body of luminous elements 23 is incident on the incident part A of the light conductor 20, is reflected in the reflecting part 30 provided along a tilted surface of the holding member 22 and the light is conducted into the light conductor 20. Some of the reflected light is further reflected on an incidence plane on which the incident part A is formed.

Shielding means 32 for preventing light from being transmitted may be also provided to the tilted surface of the holding member<br>

~*<br>
The shielding means 32 may be also printed in white on the tilted surface, a shielding tape may be also attached as the shielding means and to compose the shielding means at a low cost, the slant face has only to be touched to a white holding member. However, clearance may be made between the white holding member and the slant face depending upon dimensional tolerance and as optical path length is extended by the clearance, illuminance is deteriorated. Therefore, preferably, as the former more securely shields, a range of display can be more brightly lighted. Therefore, as light radiated by one luminous element 23<br><br>
and light radiated by another luminous element 23 are reflected on the slope of the reflecting part 30 formed in the light conductor 20 and a point where beams of light described above are synthesized can be formed in an extremely close position to the light-emitting part of the luminous element, a range of display can be lighted without unevenness from the near end to the remote end.<br>
A mark, a character, a digit and others or the periphery respectively displayed on the liquid-crystal display 19 are lighted from the back by lightening the whole region of the light conductor 20 as described above and the displayed mark, character, digit and others can be plainly ^seen from the front through the transparent window 15.<br>
Fig. 4 is a local longitudinal section showing the liquid crystal display 6 as Fig. 3 and in this case, bodies of luminous elements 23 in each of which plural luminous elements are integrated are arranged along one side of the liquid-crystal display 19, light emitted from all luminous elements is incident from the incident part provided to the same position, is reflected in the reflecting part 30 via light diffusing means 55 provided to the incident part A and the unevenness of luminance depending upon a lighted part can be removed by utilizing the same light conducting means.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 4, light radiated by the body of luminous elements 23 is incident on the incident part A of the<br><br>
light conductor 20 and passes the light diffusing means 55 provided to the incident part A. The situation will be understood referring to a local cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 5 viewed<br>
from a position different from Fig. 4 by 90°.<br>

Reflected light is further reflected on the incidence plane on which the incident part A is formed. Diffused light is directly incident on the light conductor 20.<br>
Light incident on the light conductor 20 as described above is conducted into the whole light conductor. As described above, the shielding means 32 for preventing light from being transmitted may be also provided to the tilted surface of the holding member 22.<br>
Therefore, as light radiated from one luminous element 23 and light radiated from another luminous element 23 are reflected on the slant face of the reflecting part 30, being diffused via the light diffusing means 55 formed in the light conductor 20 and a point where beams of light described above are synthesized can be formed in an extremely close position to the light-emitting part of the luminous element, a range of display can be lighted without unevenness from the near end to the remote end.<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows the optical paths of light emitted from the bodies of luminous elements arranged along one side of the liquid-crystal display in the embodiment of the invention.<br>

Light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of the luminous elements arranged in the center and light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements adjacent on the left side form a point where beams of light described above are synthesized at a point X in case no light<br>
m 4<br>
diffusing means 55 is provided. However, in case the light diffusing means 55 is provided, light radiated at the angle tp<br>
of radiation is diffused on the slant face on which the diffusing means 55 is provided after the light is incident on the light<br><br>
conductor and as a result, the angle of radiation is larger than the original angle ψ of radiation. The angle of radiation at this<br>
time after diffusion is ψ in Fig. 6, an optical path is inflected<br>
on the reflecting surface on which the diffusing means 55 is provided and at this time, a point where beams of light described above are synthesized is formed at a point Y. The relationship between light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements arranged in the center and light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements adjacent on the right side is similar to the relationship described above. The relationship between respective_light from the luminous elements G and B of another body of luminous elements is similar to the relationship described above.<br>

to the reflecting surface on which first reflection is performed of the light conductor 20 and the unevenness of luminance in a lighted part can be removed by utilizing the same light conducting means. The light diffusing means 56 is acquired by roughing the reflecting surface on which first reflection is performed.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 7, light radiated from the body of luminous elements 23 is incident on the incident part A of the light conductor 20, is diffused and reflected by the light diffusing means 56 provided.to the reflecting surface on which first reflection is performed of the light conductor 20 along the slant face of the holding member 22 and is conducted into the light conductor 20. The diffused and reflected light is further reflected on the incidence plane on which the incident part A is formed. A part of the diffused light is directly incident on the light conductor 20.<br>
Light incident on the light conductor 20 is conducted into the whole light conductor as described above. As described above, the shielding means 32 for preventing light from being transmitted can be provided to the slant face of the holding member 22.<br>
Therefore, as light radiated from one body of luminous elements 23 and light radiated from another body of luminous elements 23 are reflected, being diffused via the light diffusing means 56 formed on the light conductor 20 and a point where beams of light described above are synthesized can be formed in an<br><br>

That is, as shown in Fig. 8, light radiated from the body of luminous elements 23 is incident on the incident part A of the light conductor 20 and passes the light diffusing means 55 provided to the incident part A. The situation will be understood referring to a local cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 9 viewed<br>
from a position different from Fig. 8 by 90°.<br>
Some of diffused light is reflected in the reflecting part 30 provided along the slant face of the holding member 22 and is conducted into the light conductor 20. Also, reflected light is further reflected on the incidence plane on which the incident<br><br>
part A is formed. Also, diffused light is directly incident on the light conductor 20.<br>

Order in which R, G and B are arranged is not necessarily limited to the order described above.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, a case that light of the same wavelength is radiated from plural luminous elements will be described below. Light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements arranged in the center and light emitted from the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements adjacent on the left side form a point where beams of light described above are synthesized at a point X in case no light diffusing means 55 is provided. However, as the light diffusing means 55 is provided, a point where beams of light described above are synthesized is formed at a point Y. A diffused reflection plane by the luminous element R of the body of luminous elements is closer than the point where beams of light described above are<br><br>
synthesized Y and a range of display by irregularly reflected light can be further closer.<br>

Also, the control means 42 activates first, second and third control signals 52, 53 and 54 when the mobile telephone is in a seventh working condition. As a result, the transistors 47, 49 and 51 of the first, second and third driving means are turned on, voltage is applied to the first, second and third luminous elements 43, 44 and 45, the first, second and-third luminous elements 43, 44 and 45 respectively emit light having the first, second and third wavelengths 33, 35 and 37, light of colors having the first, second and third wavelengths is conducted to the light<br>
conductor and the liquid-crystal display 19 is lighted from the<br>
*<br>
back.<br>
As described above, as the mobile telephone can be in a any working condition of the first to the seventh working conditions, the liquid crystal display can be lighted with light of total seven types of colors, that is, three types of colors having the same wavelengths as luminescent colors and four types of resultant colors.<br>
As described above, in the embodiment of the invention, as the points where respective light is synthesized of luminous elements R, G and B can be all equalized in case the bodies of luminous elements are arranged rectilinearly along one side of the liquid-crystal display," no unevenness in brightness and no irregular color are caused in a range of display of the display and displayed character and mark can be plainly read.<br><br>
As described above, in case the body of luminous elements is arranged in parallel in the direction of the liquid-crystal display, the optical path of lower B is longer than that of upper R, however, as points where beams of light are synthesized formed by adjacent bodies of luminous elements can be equalized, no unevenness in brightness and no irregular color are caused in a range of display of the display and displayed character, mark and others can be plainly read. Also, to equalize the luminance of lower B and that of upper R, current flowing in the luminous element has only to be regulated.<br>
Further, in case current flowing in each luminous element<br>
■	*<br>
is controlled to enable regulating and varying the luminous energy of each luminous element, the intensity of radiated light can be varied. In this case, it is desirable that the magnitude of the resistor connected to the body of luminous elements in series is varied and as irregular color among luminous elements and unevenness in density in a visible range can be avoided even if the magnitude of the resistor is varied as described above, the liquid-crystal display can display plain character and mark and others and a user can see plain character, mark and others.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention, the example using the body of luminous elements in which the first, second and third luminous elements are integrated is described above, however, the first, second and third luminous elements is not necessarily<br><br>
required to be integrated. In this case, the first, second and third luminous elements are collectively arranged to be a group of luminous elements and plural groups of luminous elements have only to be provided at a short interval in the same direction along one side of the liquid-crystal display or have only to be arranged in parallel at a short interval in the direction of the liquid-crystal display.<br>
In this case, a body of luminous elements may be advantageous. First, devices on the printed board are mounted on the surface by a mounting apparatus, however, in that case, the size and power of the mounting apparatus are determined based upon the number of devices. For example, in case 100 types of electronic devices are mounted on one side of the printed board, it is desirable that two pieces of mounting apparatus each of which can mount 50 types are prepared or one mounting apparatus which can mount 100 types is prepared. In the case of a body of luminous elements, as the type of devices is smaller by two, compared with the case of a group of luminous elements, the type of devices can be reduced by two, however, as the type of devices is conversely more by two in the case of a group of luminous elements, there is a problem having a great effect upon facilities that sometimes three pieces of mounting apparatus each of which can mount 50 types are required to be prepared or two pieces of mounting apparatus each of which can mount 100 types are required to be prepared.<br><br>
The smaller in the type of devices is desirable. Therefore, as the number of devices is smaller in a body of luminous elements than in a group of luminous elements, constraint upon mounting apparatus and facilities can be reduced and is suitable for reflow mounting•<br>
A device of this type is supplied on a- reel and when a reel is unloaded, it is replaced with an unused reel and mounting is continued, however, as in the case of a body of luminous elements, one reel has only to be replaced, while in the case of a group of luminous elements, three reels are required to be replaced, work time for replacement can be reduced up to 1/3 and mounting efficiency can be enhanced.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, the case that three bodies of luminous elements are provided is described above, however, even if two or four bodies of luminous elements are provided, the s ituation is s imilar.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, as the problem of unevenness in brightness and irregular color can be solved without increasing consumed current and simultaneously, the liquid crystal display can be lighted with light of multiple types of colors, operating time since a battery is fully charged until the battery becomes empty is not reduced in case the illumination apparatus according to the invention is used for equipment to which power is supplied by a battery of limited capacity such as mobile information<br><br>
equipment, continuous operating time is extended and the illumination apparatus according to the invention is suitable for this type of equipment.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a state of lighting when a range of display is lighted in composite color. As shown in Fig. 13, when three bodies of luminous elements are all lighted, the whole region is in color acquired by mixing R, G and B in this embodiment, however, as the range is lighted with light having a wavelength of R, light having wavelengths of B and R and light having a wavelength of R from the left end in a lower part in case this embodiment is lot applied, the display is required to be shifted upward and the equipment is large-sized.<br>
An interval between bodies of luminous elements is ietermined at the stage of design when a range to be lighted and Drightness are determined, in this embodiment, an interval between respective two of three bodies of luminous elements is equalized and brightness in a range of display is regulated by the angle of tilted surface and the roughness of it. That is, as according to the invention, distance between a point where beams of light are synthesized and the body of luminous elements can be minimized by the light diffusing means whether monochrome or composite color, irregular color can be solved. In case distance between the point described above and the body of luminous elements is long, right and left parts or upper and lower parts in a range<br><br>
of display cannot be uniformly lighted.<br>
Further, in the embodiment of the invention, three bodies of luminous elements are provided, however, as the light diffusing means is provided to diffuse light radiated from the luminous element at the shortest distance and in a wide range, the number of bodies of luminous elements is not limited.<br>
That is, in case at least one body of luminous elements is provided, light radiated from the luminous element is diffused at the shortest distance and in a wide range and the body includes plural luminous elements, distance between a point where colors of respective light are mixed together with action described above and the luminous element is minimized.<br>
