				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to recordable and/or rewritable recording<br>
medium, in the field of optical recording and/or reproduction for<br>
recording digital data on a disc and/or reproducing the data therefrom, and more<br>
particularly, to a write protection method for protecting data recorded by a user on<br>
a write-once or rewritable medium from unwanted overwriting or erasing, and a<br>
recording medium for storing the write protection information.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A DVD-R (Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable) standard and a WORM. (Write<br>
Once Read Many) standard are standards for a write-once disc, and a DVD-RAM<br>
(Digital Versatile Disc Random Access Memory) standard and a DVD-RW (Digital<br>
Versatile Disc-Rewritable) standard are standards for a rewritable disc.<br>
According to the DVD-RAM standards published in July of 1997, DVD<br>
Specifications for Rewritable Disc, Part 1 Physical Specifications Version 1.0, a<br>
DVD-RAM adopts a cartridge containing a disc, and discs from Type 2 and Type 3<br>
cartridges can be used, after removal from the cartridge, as bare discs.<br>
Three types of cartridges for a DVD-RAM are defined as follows. In the<br>
Type 1 cartridge, a single sided disc or double sided disc is installed in the<br>
cartridge and the installed disc can not be taken out of the case. In the Type 2<br>
cartridge, a single sided disc is installed and the installed disc can be taken out of<br>
the case. However, when the disc is taken out of the case once, a sensor hole<br>
capable of sensing the removal of the disc is permanently changed into an open<br>
state, so that the sensor hole cannot be changed into a closed state again. Thus,<br>
it can be determined whether or not the disc has been taken out of the case.<br>
Also, in the Type 3 cartridge, a sensor hole capable of determining whether or not<br>
a disc has been taken out of the case is open at the early stage, so the disc can<br>
be taken out of or put into the case without restrictions.<br>
Also, the cartridge has a write-inhibit hole (alternatively called "recognition<br>
switch for write protection") and according to the standard at page PH-69 page<br><br>
writing is possible when the write-inhibit hole is closed and is impossible when the<br>
write-inhibit hole is open. That is, when a user intends to protect data written by<br>
the user from unwanted overwriting or erasing, the corresponding write-inhibit hole<br>
in a closed state is changed into an open state, such that a recording apparatus<br>
cannot record to the disc of the corresponding cartridge.<br>
However, in the case of using the Type 2 or Type 3 cartridge, a bare disc<br>
can be used without the case as described above. This is so the disc can be<br>
used in a thin recording/reproducing apparatus such as a laptop computer which<br>
cannot adopt a cartridge. However, the above specifications do not define any<br>
write-protect means other than the write-inhibit hole attached to the case of the<br>
cartridge.<br>
For example, when a user, after removing a disc installed in a case that<br>
protects from writing, inserts the disc into to a thin recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus that cannot accept a cartridge, the write protection by the write-inhibit<br>
hole is no longer effective.<br>
Also, there are many DVD related specifications such as DVD-ROM<br>
specification (DVD specification for Read Only Memory), DVD-R specification<br>
(DVD specification for Recordable Disc). Also, many specifications for rewritable<br>
DVD, which are not established yet, can be considered, e.g., DVD specification for<br>
rewritable and readable disc, which is very similar to the DVD-R specification, and<br>
DVD specification for disc with enhanced density. Such a series of specifications<br>
with the prefix of DVD are called "DVD family".<br>
Also, a computer operating system adopts various attributes, e.g., read-only<br>
and write protection, which is capable of preventing an arbitrary change in written<br>
data using attributes of a file that stores the data. However, when a disc is<br>
managed at a level lower than that of a file system for managing file, for example,<br>
when the recording and reproduction are directly performed, not via the file<br>
system, when the disc is initialized, where the entire file system may not be<br>
referred, or in the case that attributes of each file cannot be considered, such a<br>
method is not a perfect protection method. A method of protecting data of a bare<br>
DVD-RAM from unwanted overwriting or erasing has not yet been introduced.<br>
In the case of a DVD-RAM, a disc can be used in a bare state as well as<br>
with the case on. However, in the case of DVD-R or DVD-RW, a disc in a case<br>
cannot be used, so that the need to protect the bare disc from unwanted<br>
overwriting or erasing has increased. However, when a bare disc taken out of a<br>
case is used, it is not possible to utilize the write-inhibit hole, so the write<br>
protection must be provided on the disc itself.<br>
In the DVD-R specification, a 3.95GB specification (Version 1.0) and a<br>
4.7GB specification (final draft, Version 1.9) do not mention a write protection<br>
method for a bare disc. Meanwhile, DVD-RW specifications are being prepared<br>
based on the DVD-R specification, and particularly, Version 1.9 defines the use of<br>
a bare disc without a case. However, if a future specification defines the use of a<br>
disc in a case (for example, extension of application), there will be no write<br>
protection method to be applied to a bare disc since the conventional write<br>
protection method, which has been applied to a DVD-RAM using the write-inhibit<br>
hole, is used.<br>
If the DVD-RW specification allows the use of a case, writing can be<br>
prevented using a write-inhibit hole as in the DVD-RAM. However, if a user<br>
forgets to change the write-inhibit hole into a write-inhibit position, unwanted<br>
erasing or overwriting of data can occur.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a recording medium in<br>
which write protection information is stored on a disc contained in a case.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a recording medium<br>
in which write protection information capable of protecting a bare disc from<br>
unwanted overwriting or erasing is stored on the disc, the bare disc being taken<br>
out of a case.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a write protection<br>
method for a recording and/or reproducing apparatus, capable of protecting<br>
information written on a recordable and/or rewritable medium from being<br>
undesirably overwritten or erased.<br>
To achieve the first and second objects of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a recordable and/or rewritable recording medium to record data,<br>
comprising:<br>
a Lead-in area;<br>
a Lead-out area; and<br>
a user data area,<br>
wherein the recording medium stores write protection information to protect<br>
the data recorded on the recording medium from unwanted overwriting or erasing,<br>
with the write protection information being redundantly stored, at the same time, in a<br>
plurality of locations in the Lead-in area, and wherein the recording medium indicates<br>
a write protection state when write protection information read, without error, from<br>
one of the plurality of locations matches write protection information read, without<br>
error, from another one of the plurality of locations.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, where the write-inhibit hole of a cartridge according to<br>
the DVD-RAM specification is shown, reference numeral 1 represents a write-<br>
inhibit hole and a reference numeral 2 represents a sensor hole used to determine<br>
whether a disc has been taken out of a case.<br>
In FIG. 1, the closed write-inhibit hole 1 indicates that writing is allowed,<br>
and an open write-inhibit hole 1 indicates that writing is prohibited. Thus, when<br>
the write-inhibit hole 1 is opened, in the corresponding DVD-RAM recording/<br>
reproducing apparatus, writing of data to a disc is prohibited even if a write<br>
command is input from the outside, so that information written on the disc can be<br>
protected from unwanted overwriting.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the structure of a disc according to the DVD-RAM<br>
specification. The disc is comprised of three parts, i.e., a Lead-in area, a user<br>
data area and a Lead-out area, in the aspect of function. Also, the disc can be<br>
classified into a rewritable area and an unwritable area. In particular, the Lead-in<br>
area contains a read-only zone in the innermost part, which is an unwritable<br>
embossed data zone having pits, and a rewritable data zone following the read<br>
only zone, in which both recording and playback are possible. Meanwhile, the<br>
Lead-out area and the user data area comprise only the rewritable data zone.<br>
The read-only zone of the Lead-in area contains information about physical<br>
specifications of the disc. The rewritable data zone of the Lead-in area and the<br>
Lead-out area contain four defect management areas DMA 1, DMA 2, DMA 3 and<br>
DMA 4 in which information about disc defects is written, a disc test zone for use<br>
by a disc manufacturer in checking the status of the disc, a drive test zone for<br>
testing recording and reproduction operations in a recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus, a guard track zone for connecting each zone, and a disc identification<br>
zone.<br>
In the DVD-RAM specification version 1.0, the purpose in use of the disc<br>
identification zone and the content thereof are not yet clearly described.<br>
FIGs. 3A and 3B show the data structure in the defect management area<br>
(DMA) described at pages PH-155 through PH-158 of the DVD-RAM specification,<br>
particularly, and in particular, they show the data structure of a disc certification<br>
flag and a group certification flag respectively, in a disc definition structure (DDS)<br>
area.<br>
A total of four defect management areas DMA 1, DMA 2, DMA 3 and DMA<br>
4 are present in the Lead-in area and the Lead-out area of a disc, wherein DMA 1<br>
and DMA 2 exist in the Lead-in area and DMA 3 and DMA 4 exist in the Lead-out<br>
area, and identical information relating to disc defects and initialization of the disc<br>
is stored in each area. Writing such identical information in different areas, i.e., in<br>
two areas DMA 1 and DMA 2 of the Lead-in area and in two areas DMA 3 and<br>
DMA 4 in the Lead-out area, is done to prevent the problem of data becoming<br>
unusable due to disc defects.<br>
In the byte position 3, i.e., BP3, of the disc definition structure (DDS), a disc<br>
certification flag as shown in FIG. 3A is present, and the disc certification flag<br>
comprises "In Process" information indicating the initialization state of the disc, a<br>
"User certification" flag indicating whether the disc is certified by a user, and a<br>
"Disc manufacturer certification" flag indicating whether the corresponding disc is<br>
certified by a disc manufacturer, and flag information written in the byte position<br>
BP3 is information about the entire disc.<br>
Also, in the byte positions 16 to 39, BP16-BP39, each byte has a group<br>
certification flag as shown in FIG. 3B in an identical configuration. The byte<br>
positions BP16-BP39 have initialization information about 24 recordable areas,<br>
i.e., a group, defined in the DVD-RAM specification version 1.0. That is, each<br>
group certification flag has "In Process" information indicating the initialization<br>
state of the corresponding group and a "User certification" flag indicating whether<br>
the disc is certified by a user. Here, the group refers to specific recordable areas<br>
of the disc.<br>
FIGs. 4A and 4B are examples of the data structures of a disc certification<br>
flag and a group certification flag of the disc definition structure (DDS) area of the<br>
defect management area (DMA) that stores write protection information according<br>
to the present invention. In the data structure of the disc certification flag shown<br>
in FIG. 4A, "Disc write protection" information is stored in bits b4 and b3 of a<br>
reserved disc certification flag "Reserved", in contrast to the data structure of the<br>
disc certification flag shown in FIG. 3A, and is defined as follows.<br>
Disc write protection<br>
b4, b3 = 00b: Disc is not write protected<br>
10b: Disc is write protected<br>
Entire disc shall not be written to except for drive<br>
test area, and DMA area<br>
11b: Disc is write protected<br>
Entire disc shall not be written to<br>
These bits shall not be modified to other values<br>
Others: Reserved<br>
In the same manner, the data structure of the group certification flag shown<br>
in FIG. 4B stores "Group write protection" information in bits b4 and b3 of a<br>
reserved group certification flag "Reserved", in contrast to the data structure of the<br>
group certification flag shown in FIG. 3B, and is defined as follows.<br>
Group write protection<br>
b4, b3 = 00b: Group is not write protected<br>
10b: Group is write protected. User data shall<br>
not be written to this block<br>
Others: Reserved<br>
The states of the bits b4 and b3 of the disc certification flag, and those of<br>
the bit b4 and b3 of the group certification flag are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
In the above Table 1, soft write protection means that write protection can<br>
be released, that is, that the write protection state can be changed to a rewritable<br>
state by setting the corresponding bit b4 to "0". Also, hard write protection means<br>
that write protection is aoolied to the Lead-out area as well as to the Lead-in area,<br>
so that the write protection state can not be restored to the rewritable state.<br>
In the hard write protection for the group, making a part of the disc hard<br>
write-protected does not provide advantages to a user in use, rather than in a<br>
technical aspect, and particularly there is a problem of processing in the<br>
corresponding group when the entire disc is reinitialized. Thus, it is unfavorable to<br>
set the hard write protection for the group.<br>
As shown in the data structure of FIGs. 4A and 4B, the write protection<br>
information of the disc is written in the disc definition structure (DDS) of the defect<br>
management area (DMA), and identical write protection information is written four<br>
times to the same disc, so that robustness of the write protection information on<br>
the disc is enhanced.<br>
When a bare disc that is write protected is inserted for use into a case, the<br>
write-inhibit hole of which is in a rewritable state, or if a bare disc that is not write<br>
protected is inserted into a case, the write-inhibit hole of which is in a write<br>
protection state, the write inhibition information stored on the disc cannot match<br>
the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case.<br>
In such a case, if either one of the disc or the case is write protected, it is<br>
preferable to operate to be suitable for the write protection state. This is because<br>
in the user's position it is preferable that the content of data is checked again<br>
without overwriting rather than the important data being damaged through<br>
overwriting.<br>
FIGs. 5A and 5B are further examples of the data structures of the disc<br>
certification flag and the group certification flag, respectively, of the disc definition<br>
structure (DDS) area of the defect management area (DMA) that stores the write<br>
protection information according to the present invention.<br>
In the case where the write protection information is in the disc certification<br>
flag shown in FIG. 5A, only one bit b4 can be used regardless of whether the write<br>
protection information is for the hard write protection or for the soft write<br>
protection, which is defined as follows.<br>
Disc write protection<br>
b4 = Ob: Disc is not write protected<br>
1b: Disc is write protected<br>
Entire disc shall not be written to except for drive test<br>
area, and DMA area<br>
The group test flag shown in FIG. 5B can store the write protection<br>
information using only one bit b4, which is defined as follows.<br>
Group write protection<br>
b4 = Ob: Group is not write protected<br>
1b: Group is write protected<br>
User data shall not be written to this block<br>
In this case, preferably bit b4 of the disc certification flag and the bit b4 of<br>
the group certification flag are used. However, instead of using the bit b4 of the<br>
disc certification flag or group certification flag, any "Reserved" bits can be used.<br>
Also, the bit b4 of the group certification flag, that is, "Group write<br>
protection" flag, may not be used. This is effective in a disc in which only a<br>
specific group is not write protected, and in this case the bit b4 of the group<br>
certification flag is "Reserved" as in the conventional specifications.<br>
The present invention can be applied to a case without a write-inhibit hole,<br>
and information on the disc can be efficiently protected in this case using the write<br>
protection information stored on the disc.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a write-protection method according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. First, it is checked whether a disc<br>
is installed in a case (step S101), and if the disc is installed in the case, the state<br>
of the write-inhibit hole of the case is checked (step S102). That is, when the<br>
write-inhibit hole is closed, it means that cartridge is not write protected. When<br>
the write-inhibit hole is open, it means that the cartridge is write protected.<br>
If it is determined in step S101 that the disc is not installed in the case, or<br>
after the state of the write-inhibit hole is checked in step S102, a write protection<br>
flag of the disc is checked (step S103). That is, write protection flags within the<br>
disc certification flag and the group certification flag are checked.<br>
It is determined whether the write protection information of the disc matches<br>
the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case (step S104). That is, when write<br>
protection information is written on the disc and the write-inhibit hole of the case is<br>
open, it is determined whether the write protection flag of the disc certification flag<br>
is set to a "write protection" state (step S105). Otherwise, a user is informed of<br>
that the write protection information of the disc does not match the state of the<br>
write-inhibit hole of the case (step S106).<br>
If the write protection flag of the disc certification flag is set as a write<br>
protection state in the step S105, or if one of either the disc or the case indicates<br>
the write protection state even though both the write-protection states of the disc<br>
and the case do not match in the step S106, it is checked whether the disc is set<br>
to a "hard write protection" state (step S107). If the disc is set to the "hard write<br>
protection" state, data writing to the entire disc including the Lead-in area and the<br>
Lead-out area other than the user data area is prohibited (step S108). Otherwise,<br>
data writing in the user data area other than the drive test area and the defect<br>
management area (DMA) is prohibited (step S109).<br><br>
If it is determined in the step S105 that the write protection flag of the disc<br>
certification flag is not set to the "writing protection" state, it is checked whether<br>
the write protection flag of the group certification flag is set to the "write<br>
protection": state (step S110). If the write protection flag of the group certification<br>
flag is set to a "write protection" state, writing data in the corresponding group is<br>
prohibited (step S111). Otherwise, data writing is allowed in the rewritable area<br>
(step S112).<br>
The write protection method illustrated in FIG. 6 corresponds to the case of<br>
using the disc certification flag containing the hard write protection flag shown in<br>
FIG. 4A, and the group certification flag shown in FIG. 4B. When the disc<br>
certification flag of FIG. 5A and the group certification flag of FIG. 5B are used,<br>
the steps S107 and S108 illustrated with reference to FIG. 6 are not performed.<br>
When the disc certification flag is set to the "write protection" state in the step<br>
S105, writing data in the user data area is prohibited in step S109.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method of setting a rewritable disc to the<br>
write protection state or of changing the write protection state of the disc to a<br>
rewritable state. A method of updating the write protection information will now be<br>
described with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 7.<br>
In FIG. 7, when a disc or a cartridge is inserted into a recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus, the write protection information is checked (step S201). Then, it is<br>
determined whether the write protection information has been input by a user (step<br>
S202) and when the write protection information is input by the user, it is<br>
determined whether information set by the user is for write protection (step S203).<br>
If the information set by the user is write protection information, the corresponding<br>
write protection flag of the disc is set to the write protection state (step S204).<br>
When the information set by the user is not write protection information in<br>
step S203, it is determined whether the information set by the user is write<br>
protection release information (step S205). If the information set by the user is the<br>
write protection release information, it is determined whether the current disc is in<br>
a hard write protection state (step S206). If the current disc is in the hard write<br>
protection state, the user is informed of that write protection cannot be released<br>
(step S207). If it is determined in step S206 that the disc is not in the hard write<br><br>
protection state, the corresponding write protection flag of the disc is set to the<br>
rewritable state (step S208).<br>
Also, when the setting of the write protection or the release of the write<br>
protection of the disc is completed, that is, the step S204, S207 or S208 is<br>
completed, and the disc is installed in a case, it is determined in step S209 that<br>
the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case matches the write protection<br>
information stored in the disc. If the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case does<br>
not match the state of the disc, the user is informed of such difference (step<br>
S210), and then the procedure is completed.<br>
The method of updating the write-protection information, illustrated in FIG.<br>
7, can be performed when a bare disc is inserted or a disc in a case is inserted,<br>
and can be performed after the write-protection is controlled using the write<br>
protection information as illustrated with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the write protection<br>
information of the disc is written in the defect management area of the disc.<br>
However, the disc identification zone of FIG. 2 can be used instead of the defect<br>
management area of the disc. The disc identification zone is present both in the<br>
Lead-in area and the Lead-out area, like the defect management area of the disc.<br>
Thus, writing identical information two or more times to the disc identification<br>
zones located in the Lead-in area and the Lead-out area can ensure robustness<br>
as strong as in the defect management area of the disc.<br>
Since the disc identification zone is not presently used for a specific<br>
purpose, there is an advantage that the disc identification zone does not conflict<br>
with the information written in the defect management area of the disc. In<br>
particular, information of the defect information area relates to only the DVD-RAM,<br>
it is difficult to maintain consistency between discs for optical recording/<br>
reproduction. Meanwhile, since the disc identification zone is not restricted to a<br>
specific disc, the disc identification zone can maintain consistency with another<br>
disc satisfying the similar specifications.<br>
An example of storing the write protection information using the disc<br>
identification zone will be described with reference to FIGs. 8 and 9.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, in the structure of a disc identification zone that stores<br>
write protection information for a bare disc, four flags for write protection are<br><br>
concurrently written to the disc identification zone, and two or more normal flags^of<br>
the four flags are read. If the contents of the read flags matches each other, it is<br>
regarded that the write protection is set for the disc.<br>
For example, the four flags are written in only the disc identification zone of<br>
the Lead-in area, and disc identification information of 1 block length (=1 byte) is<br>
successively written four times in the four blocks from the start of the disc<br>
identification zone of the Lead-in area, and all the first bytes of disc identification<br>
information contain a write protection flag. The disc identification information of 1<br>
block length is summarized as shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
BP	Contents	Number of bytes<br>
0	Write protection information	1 byte<br>
1 to 32767	Reserved	32767 bytes<br>
The write protection flag of the disc identification information corresponds to<br>
the most significant bit (MSB) of the first byte as shown in FIG. 9. When the flag<br>
(indicated by "WP") value is 1b (binary), it means that the entire area of disc is<br>
write protected except for the disc identification zone and the drive test zone.<br>
Also, when the flag value is Ob, it means that the entire area of disc is rewritable.<br>
That is, "WP" of FIG. 9 is defined as follows.<br>
WP = 1b: Entire area of disc is write protected except for Drive test zone<br>
and Disc identification zone.<br>
= Ob: Entire area of disc is not write inhibited<br>
The reason why only two normal flags are read from the four written write<br>
protection flags is as follows. In the case where only one write protection flag is<br>
written, an error can be generated in the area in which the corresponding flag is<br>
written, so that the area cannot be used. Also, in the case where only reading<br>
and not writing is allowed, there is a possibility of abnormal operation such that no<br><br>
information can be written to the disc permanently by erroneously reading the<br>
corresponding flag.<br>
Meanwhile, when writing write protection information in a plurality of<br>
locations, there is a problem in that the time required for reading the<br>
corresponding information gets longer. That is, the time required for a series of<br>
processes from the insertion of a disc, including reading various information from<br>
the disc and recognizing the information required for the control of the disc by a<br>
microcontroller, can be become longer.<br>
However, in the case of updating the write protection information, operation<br>
only for the updating is performed. That is, because information is not read, the<br>
writing time in units of several hundreds milliseconds is barely worth consideration.<br>
Thus, writing is performed in four locations in consideration of the robustness of<br>
information, and error correction capability is taken into account during the<br>
recording. That is, if two errors are not generated, or normally corrected flags are<br>
read and two of them match each other, the write protection state of the disc is set<br>
without reading the remaining flags, thereby increasing the operating speed.<br>
The write protection method suggested above is not limited to only the<br>
DVD-RAM, and can be applied to a disc that has specifications physically the<br>
same as DVD-R/RW and similar to the DVD specifications, which will now be<br>
described.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the structure of a disc according to general DVD-R and<br>
DVD-RW specifications. The disc is roughly divided into two parts with respect to<br>
functionality, including an R (Recording)-information area and an information area.<br>
The R-information area is divided into a PCA (Power Calibration Area) for<br>
calibrating power, and an RMA (Recording Management Area) including general<br>
information relating to recording, i.e., information about the recording mode of a<br>
disc, recording state, optimal power control and border zone, and the information<br>
area is divided into a Lead-in area, data recordable area in which data is<br>
recordable by a user and a Lead-out area that is not defined yet in the DVD-R and<br>
DVD-RW specifications.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG. 11, the Lead-in area comprises an Initial zone<br>
(contents: OOh) for which a specific purpose is not defined, a reference code zone<br>
(channel bit pattern: 3T-6T-7T) used to control an equalizer for a radio frequency<br><br>
signal in a drive, first and second buffer zones (contents: OOh) and a control data<br>
zone containing the contents shown in FIG. 12.<br>
In FIG. 12, physical format information of the control data zone is about<br>
types and versions of the specifications, disc size, maximum transmission rate,<br>
disc structure (single/dual), recording density and data region allocation, and the<br>
disc manufacturing information is unrelated to compatibility.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the content of an RMD (Recording Management Data) field<br>
of the RMA according to the DVD-R and DVD-RW specifications. The RMA<br>
comprises a RMA Lead-in area including a system reserved field (contents: OOh)<br>
and a unique ID field, and RMD fields. As shown in FIG. 13, one RMD field<br>
consists of 16 sectors, in which the first sector is allocated as a linking-loss area,<br>
general information of the disc is stored in RMD field 0, Optimum Power Control<br>
(OPC) related information is stored in RMD field 1, user specific data (contents:<br>
OOh) is stored in RMD field 2, and border zone information is stored in RMD field<br>
3. Also, in the case of a DVD-R disc according to the specifications of version<br>
1.9, Rzone (Recording Zone) information including recording items is stored in<br>
RMD field 4 through RMD field 12 whenever the recording is performed, and RMD<br>
field 13 and RMD field 14 are reserved.<br>
In the case of rewritable and erasable DVD-RW disc the specifications of<br>
which are not yet defined, Rzone information is stored in RMD field 4, and RMD<br>
field 5 and RMD field 12 are allocated to store defect management &amp; certification<br>
related information taking reliability, certification before the disc is used and<br>
management of defect in use into consideration. Also, RMD field 13 and RMD<br>
field 14 are reserved.<br>
FIG. 14 shows the contents of the general information of a disc stored in<br>
the RMD field 0 of FIG. 13. In FIG. 14, byte positions BPO and BP1 stores<br>
information about RMD format (recorded only with 0001 h), byte position BP2<br>
stores information about the disc status, and byte position BP3 is reserved. The<br>
byte positions BP4 through BP21 store unique disc identifier information that<br>
stores the recording date and time of the data as ASCII code. Pre-pit information<br>
is copied over the byte positions BP22 through BP85, and the remaining byte<br>
positions BP86 through BP2047 are reserved. Here, in the DVD-R disc the disc<br>
status information stored in the byte position BP2 is defined as follows.<br><br>
(BP2) Disc status<br>
00b: Indicates that disc is empty<br>
01b: Indicates that disc is in Disc-at-once recording mode<br>
02b: Indicates that disc is in incremental recording mode<br>
03b: Indicates that disc is finalized where incremental recording is used<br>
Others: Reserved<br>
FIG. 15 is an example of a table showing the state where the write<br>
protection information is stored on the disc adopting the DVD-R and DVD-RW<br>
specifications according to the present invention using the general information of a<br>
disc stored in RMD field 0 of FIG. 13.<br>
That is, by defining the following using the reserved byte position BP3 of<br>
RMD field 0, information that the current disc is write protected can be transmitted<br>
to a drive.<br>
(BP3) Disc write protection flag<br>
00b: Indicates that disc is not write protected<br>
01b: Indicates that disc is write protected (hard)<br>
02b: Indicates that disc is write protected (soft)<br>
Entire disc shall not be written to except for PCA, etc.<br>
In the write protection information according to the present invention, 00b<br>
indicates that the disc is not write protected, 01b indicates that the entire disc is<br>
write protected (hard write protection), and 02b indicates that the entire disc<br>
except for a part of the disc (e.g., the PCA) is write protected (soft write<br>
protection). In the present embodiment, the write-protection information indicates<br>
that the entire disc is write protected or is not write protected. However, the RMD<br>
field of FIG. 13 is written connected to the previous data whenever new data is<br>
written, so that the write-protection can be set for only the written data<br>
corresponding to the RMD.<br>
For example, even though write protection information is stored in the byte<br>
position BP3 of RMD field 0, the write protection information on a bare disc can be<br>
written using the Lead-in area and the Lead-out area shown in FIG. 10 in addition<br><br>
to the RMD area. Also, the byte position BP2 of RMD field 0 stores the disc<br>
status information, so that write protection information can be stored in the byte ,<br>
position BP2 of RMD.<br>
Since the write protection information cannot be updated in the once-<br>
writable DVD-R, in consideration of the consistency with the DVD family, write<br>
protection information can be indicated through finaiization that means the writing<br>
on the defined Lead-in area and Lead-out area. That is, that the finaiization is<br>
completed indicates the DVD-R is write-protected. Otherwise, it means that there<br>
is no write protection.<br>
Also, as in the defect management area DMA 1, DMA 2, DMA 3 and DMA 4<br>
of the DVD-RAM, the same content is recorded multiple times to cope with errors,<br>
thereby ensuring robustness. In the DVD-R/RW, such robustness is ensured by<br>
grouping RMDs of the RMA and providing the RMDs belonging to one group with<br>
the same content.<br>
A disc must include format information informing whether the current disc is<br>
a DVD-R or a DVD-RW, such that a DVD-R disc and a DVD-RW disc is<br>
compatible in the same drive. As shown in FIG. 15, the RMD format can be<br>
defined using the byte positions BPO and BP1 of RMD field 0 as follows.<br>
(BP0.1) RMD format<br>
0001 h for R<br>
0002h for RW<br>
0003h for R/RW compatible mode<br>
FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating a write protection method according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, in consideration of application<br>
extension to a DVD-RW contained in a case.<br>
First, it is determined whether a disc is installed in a case (step S301). If<br>
the disc is installed in the case, the state of a write-inhibit hole of the case is<br>
checked (step 302). That is, if the write-inhibit hole is closed, it means that<br>
cartridge is not write protected, and if the write-inhibit hole is open, it means that<br>
the cartridge is write protected.<br><br>
When the disc is not installed in the case in step S301, or when the state of<br>
the write-inhibit hole is checked in step S302, the write-protection flag of the disc<br>
is checked (step S303). That is, a write protection flag within RMD field 0 is<br>
checked.<br>
Then, it is determined whether the write protection information of the disc<br>
matches the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case (step S304). That is, when<br>
the write protection information is written on the disc and the write-inhibit hole of<br>
the case is opened, it is determined that the write protection flag is in a "write<br>
protection" state (step S305). Otherwise, the user is informed of that the write<br>
protection information of the disc does not match the state of the write-inhibit hole<br>
of the case (step S306).<br>
If the write protection flag of the disc is set to the "write protection" state in<br>
step S305, or after the step 306, that is, if either the disc or the case is in a "write<br>
protection" state even though the write protection information of the disc does not<br>
match the state of the write-inhibit hole of the case, it is determined whether the<br>
disc is set to the "hard write protection" state (step S307). If the disc is in the<br>
"hard write protection" state, the entire disc including the user data area is write-<br>
prohibited (step S308). Otherwise, only the user data area is write protected (step<br>
S309). Also, in the step S305 if the write protection flag is not in the "write<br>
protection" state, the disc is not write-protected (step S310).<br>
In recordable and/or rewritable medium according to the present invention,<br>
e.g., disc satisfying the DVD specifications, e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-R and DVD-RW,<br>
data of a bare disc that is not contained in a case can be efficiently protected.<br>
Also, when either the case or the disc is in the write protection state, the writing of<br>
data is prohibited and the user is allowed to check the state of a disc or a<br>
cartridge. As a result, the data recorded in the disc can be protected efficiently<br>
from unwanted overwriting or erasing.<br><br>
