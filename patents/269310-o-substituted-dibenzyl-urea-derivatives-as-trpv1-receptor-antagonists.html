				<td>O-SUBSTITUTED-DIBENZYL UREA-DER1VATIVES AS TRPV1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to vanilloid receptor antagonists, in particular to O-hydroxyalkyl dibenzyl urea-deR1vatives that antagonize the vanilloid TRPV1 receptor.<br>
State of the art<br>
Recent expeR1mental evidences have demonstrated that the expression of the vanilloid TRPV1 receptor (transient receptor potential channel) increases in the course of inflammatory states. This suggested that vanilloid receptor antagonists could be useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain states, for example chronic neuropathic pain, over-active bladder syndrome, haemorrhoids, inflammatory hyperalgesia, post-intervention pain, dental extraction, airway and gastro-intestinal diseases.<br>
A number of vanilloid receptor antagonists are known; some of them deR1ve from capsaicin and are referred to as capsaicinoid antagonists.<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
The reactions were routinely monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (precoated F245 Merck plates) and the products were visualized with an iodine or potassium permanganate solution. 1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCI3, CF3COOD or DMSO-d6 with a VaR1an VXR 200 spectrometer. Peak positions are given in parts per million (6) downfield from tetramethylsilane as internal standard, and J values are given in Hz. IR spectra were recorded on a Pye Unicam SP 300 spectrometer using the KBr Wafer technique. Mass spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu QP5050 Dl 50 spectrometer. The expression "Light petroleum ether" refers to the petroleum fraction boiling at 40-60°C. Melting points (M.p.) were determined on a Buchi-Tottoli instrument and are uncorrected. Chromatographies were performed using Merck 60-200 mesh silica gel. The synthesized compounds showed 1H NMR spectra in agreement with the assigned structures. Elemental analyses were within ±0.4% of the theoretical values for C, H and N.<br>

Biological Assays<br>
Animals<br>
In vivo expeR1ments were conducted with PharmEste srl (Ferrara, Italy) and with the University of Ferrara, following protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Ferrara.<br><br>
Radioligand binding assay<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats with body weight between 250 to 350 g were used. For binding assays the rats were decapitated under anesthesia and the spinal cord was removed and disrupted using a Polytron tissue homogenizer in ice cold buffer containing 5 mM KCI, 5.8 mM NaCI, 0.75 mM CaCb, 2 mM MgCb, 320 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, pH 8.6 (Szallasi and Blunberg, 1992; 1993). In competition expeR1ments, the membranes were incubated at 37°C for 60 min with [3H]RTX (0.4 nM) and with increasing concentrations of test compounds in the range from 0.1 nM to 3 uM. Non-specific binding was evaluated in the presence of 1 uM RTX. Saturation and competition studies were analyzed with the Ligand program (Bradford, 1976; Munson and Rodbard, 1980).<br>
Ca2+ fluorescence measurements in cultured rat tR1geminal ganglia<br>
The calibration curve was determined using a buffer containing Fura-2-AM-ester and definite concentrations of free Ca2+. This curve was then used to convert the data obtained from F340/F380 ratio to [Ca2+]i (nM) (Kudo, Y). The effects of pretreatments with compounds 6a-6m on the increase in [Ca2+]i produced by 30 nM capsaicin were studied.<br>
Capsaicin-induced secondary allodynia in rat<br>
Capsaicin (5 nmols/50 ul/paw) was injected in the plantar surface of the glabrous skin of the R1ght paw of rats anesthetized with diethyl ether (Chaplan et al., 1994). Compounds 6c and 6d were orally administrated 2 hours pR1or to capsaicin injection. Tactile allodynia was evaluated 90 min after capsaicin challenge.<br>
Reagents<br>
The stock concentrations of capsaicin (10 mM) was prepared in absolute ethanol. Compounds 6a-6m were prepared in 50% DMSO and 50% Tween 80. Fura-2-AM-ester and ionomycin were dissolved in 100% DMSO.<br><br>
All the other drugs were dissolved in distilled water. The appropR1ate dilutions were then made in Krebs buffer solution.<br>
Results<br>
Radioligand binding assays<br>
Compounds 6a-6m displaced [3H]RTX from its binding site in rat spinal cord membranes at low concentrations, as indicated by the Kj values reported in Table 1.<br>
Ca2+ fluorescence Assay<br>
Capsaicin (30 nM) increased [Ca2+]i in the vast majoR1ty (95%) of rat tR1geminal neuron cells, which were therefore identified as TRPV1-expressing neurons. IC50 values of inhibiting capsaicin-evoked [Ca2+]i mobilization are summaR1zed in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Ki and IC50 values of some representative compounds of the invention.<br><br>
The (R)-(-) and (S)-(+)-isomers of compounds 6c and 6d were also synthesized in order to appreciate the difference in activity with the respect to the racemic compounds. The most active isomer was the (R)-(-) form whereas as the (S)-(+)-form was at least 300 fold less active as shown in Table 2.<br>
Due to the results obtained with the synthesis of the two separate isomers, compounds 6i-6m where directly synthesized in the active (R)-(-) forms.<br><br>
Table 2. CompaR1son between compounds 6c and 6d with their active isomers.<br><br>
The results are expressed as Mean and 95% fiducial limits. Capsaicin-induced secondary allodynia in rat<br>
In a more extended study, compounds 6c and 6d were tested against capsaicin-induced secondary allodynia in rats. 90 Min after the capsaicin challenge, compounds 6c and 6d (both at 30 ^mol/kg, p.o), significantly prevented the pro-allodinic effect of capsaicin (53.1% and 47.9% of inhibition, respectively).<br>
ADME Studies<br>
In order to select suitable drug candidates, ADME studies in vitro were performed on selected compounds 6c, 6d along with their active isomers, so as to assess the properties of these compounds according to the substituents.<br>
LogD Values at pH=7.0 were calculated in silico, while the in vitro tests analysed:<br>
-	metabolic stability in cryopreserved human hepatocytes;<br>
-	cytotoxicity on Hep G2 cells;<br>
-	cassette pharmacokinetics in rat.<br>
The data of the compounds of the invention were compared to those obtained on two structurally different compounds recently disclosed as TRPV1 antagonists, namely JYL 1421 (Jakab et al.. 2005) and SB-705498 (Rami et al., 2006) and to those obtained with two widely used drugs, one with short half life (naloxone) and one with long half-life (tolbutamide). The most relevant ADME data allow rapid compaR1son of the influence of specific substituents, especially on metabolic stability.<br><br>
Hepatocytes preparation<br>
The cells were rapidly and carefully thawed and diluted in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit Buffer (KHB). After centR1fugation (50 g, 5 min.) the supernatant was discharged and the cells were resuspended in a volume of ice-cold KHB to a greater density than 2X (with respect to the final concentration of incubation) of viable cells/ml based on nominal concentration in cryopreserved vials. The viable cells were counted by Trypan Blue exclusion with a haemocytometer and the concentration of viable hepatocytes was accurately corrected to 2X concentration with KHB.<br>
Hep G2 cells preparation<br>
The cells were cultured for 3 days, trypsinized and re-suspended in 20 ml of culture medium. The cells were then counted and diluted to obtain a final concentration suitable for seeding 40.000 cells/well in 96-well cell culture plates (200 ul/well).<br>
The cells were seeded in columns 1 to 11 (column 12 contained medium without cells), then placed for 16-24 hours at 37°C with 5% of CO2.<br>
Compounds preparation<br>
Test and reference compounds were prepared at 2X incubation concentrations (10 and 1 uM) diluting 10 pi of stock solution in 0.99 ml of KHB to a concentration of 10 uM and 5 pi of stock solution in 0.995 pi of KHB to a concentration 5 pM. 300 pi of 10 pM and 1 pM solutions were then dispensed respectively in 2 and 1 incubation test tubes (SteR1lin T.C. tube 17 x 100 mm).<br>
Preliminary cassette pharmacokinetic study in catheteR1zed conscious rats<br>
Compounds were administered together to rats. The compounds were stored at -20°C when not used. The formulation, route of administration, plasma samples identification and pharmacokinetic analysis were performed according to standard protocols (Raynaud, Fl et al, 2004; Manitpisitkul, P. et<br><br>
al., 2004; Singh S. et al., 2006).<br>
Results<br>
With respect to compounds la, lb, Ic disclosed in WO 2005/123666 A1, this new seR1es of O-hydroxyalkyl urea deR1vatives showed a clear unexpected improvement in terms of metabolic stability and cytotoxicity comparable to reference compounds JYL 1421 and SB-705498 and a good half-life time, their clearance being relatively slow. Also cytotoxicity values expressed as micromolar IC50 were acceptable. Table 3 reports the ADME profile of two compounds of the invention with respect to compounds disclosed in WO 2005/123666.<br>
Furthermore, the (/3)-(-)-isomers of compounds 6c and 6d showed a further improvement in terms of half-life, maintaining at the same time good values of metabolic stability and low cytotoxicity (Table 3).<br>
