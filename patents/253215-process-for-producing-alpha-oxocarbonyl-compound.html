DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The processes (l) and (2) have a problem that the yield of the desired compound is low and there is much waste. The process (3) has a problem that potassium permanganate is harmful. The processes (4) and (5) have a problem that special equipment is necessary because the former is a gas phase reaction and the latter involves light irradiation. The process (6) has a problem that volumetric efficiency is low because a hypochlorite, for example sodium hypochlorite can generally be obtained only as an aqueous solution of low concentration, and there is much waste. The process (7) has a problem that N-bromosuccinimide is harmful to the environment because of having halogen. The process (8) is an excellent process of<br><br>
less waste because a mild condition is adopted and oxygen or air is used as an oxidant, but since, in order to attain high yield without deactivating vanadium oxytrichloride actually used in examples, it is necessary to lower the concentration of the α -hydroxycarbonyl compound in the reaction system (less than 3 % by mass in any of examples), and thus it is impossible to heighten the concentration of the starting compound, the process is low in productivity and cannot be said to be an industrially useful production process. Therefore, it is hard to say that the above-mentioned processes are industrially favorable processes for producing α -oxocarbonyl compounds.<br>
The object of this invention is providing a process which solves the above problems and by which α-oxocarbonyl compounds can be industrially favorably and efficiently produced in a high yield.<br>

the presence of a carboxylic anhydride,<br>
(C)	the process for producing α-oxocarbonyl compound (I) which comprises a step<br>

As the carboxylic acid, there can be mentioned, for example, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, pivalic acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic<br><br>
acid, octanoic acid, and the like. Preferred among them is acetic acid.

In the present invention, a carboxylic anhydride can be made to exist in the reaction system. When the carboxylic anhydride is added, it is possible to remove water which formed in the reaction as a byproduct and sometimes increase the yield of the α -oxocarbonyl compound (I). As the carboxylic anhydride, there can be mentioned acetic anhydride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, isobutyric anhydride, pivalic anhydride, pentanoic anhydride, succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, and the like. Particularly, it is preferred to use the acid anhydride of a carboxylic acid used in the present invention (for example, when acetic acid is used as the carboxylic acid, acetic anhydride is used as the carboxylic anhydride). When the carboxylic anhydride is used, its amount used is not particularly limited, but, usually,<br><br>
preferably in the range of 1 to 500 % by mol, more preferably in the range of 1 to 200 % by mol, still further preferably in the range of 5 to 100 % by mol, based on the α-hydroxycarbonyl compound (II).<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 0 to 150°C, and from the viewpoint of reaction rate, selectivity of reaction and stability of the desired compound, it is more preferably in the range of 20 to 80°C. The reaction time varies depending on the kind and amount of the α-hydroxycarbonyl compound (II), vanadium compound and carboxylic acid, pressure, temperature, and the like, but, usually, is in the range of 30 minutes to 50 hours.<br>
The process of the present invention is carried out in the presence of oxygen or air. The concentration of oxygen is not particularly limited, and can appropriately be adopted taking the aspect of safety such as explosion limit in the reaction system, and the like. It is also possible to use oxygen or air after dilution with an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
The reaction pressure is preferably 10 MPa or less, more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 MPa.<br>
There is no particular limitation in the operation of the present invention, and the invention can be operated, for example, by mixing an α-hydroxycarbonyl compound (II), a vanadium compound, a carboxylic acid, and, if desired, a carboxylic anhydride (preferably the acid anhydride of the carboxylic acid used in the reaction; as is the same hereinafter) and an aforementioned solvent other than the carboxylic acid, and allowing them to react at a prescribed temperature, under atmospheric pressure or pressurization, in an atmosphere of oxygen or air. Further, from the viewpoint of safety and stability of the α -hydroxycarbonyl compound (II), it is also possible to carry out the reaction by dropwise addition of α -hydroxycarbonyl compound (II) to a mixture of vanadium compound, a carboxylic acid, and, if desired, a carboxylic anhydride and an aforementioned solvent other than the carboxylic acid, at a prescribed temperature, under atmospheric or elevated pressure of oxygen or air. Since water is formed as a<br><br>
byproduct in the reaction, it is also possible to carry out the reaction while removing water. There is no particular limitation in a method to remove the water, and there can be mentioned, for example, a method comprising adding a dehydration agent which does not affect the reaction, such as molecular sieves or an aforementioned carboxylic anhydride, to the reaction mixture, a method comprising dehydration by carrying out the reaction while azeotropic distillation of the water with the solvent in the reaction system is made, etc.<br>
Isolation and purification of the thus obtained α -oxocarbonyl compound (I) from the reaction mixture can be carried out according to methods generally used in isolation and purification of organic compounds. For example, the α-oxocarbonyl compound (I) can be isolated by distilling off the carboxylic acid, the solvent optionally used, etc. from the reaction mixture, and further distilling the obtained residue by thin film distillation or the like.<br>
In the present invention, it is possible to recover the carboxylic acid and the solvent optionally used from the reaction mixture, and use at least part of the carboxylic acid again in the reaction system. Namely, it is possible to appropriately separate and remove existing low boiling components (impurities having a boiling point lower than that of the used carboxylic acid, for example impurities whose boiling point at atmospheric pressure is about 100°C or less); recover the carboxylic acid and the solvent optionally used; dehydrate the carboxylic acid and the solvent with a dehydrating agent such as a carboxylic anhydride or molecular sieves preferably so that the water content thereof can be 1,000 ppm or less based on the total amount of the carboxylic acid and the solvent optionally used; and reuse the resulting carboxylic acid in the reaction after separation from solvent or without separation.<br>
There is no particular limitation as to production processes of the α -hydroxycarbonyl compound (II) used as a starting compound of the present invention. For example, methyl α -hydroxybutanoate can be obtained according to a process comprising hydration of cyanohydrin with water and sulfuric acid,<br><br>
esterification of the resulting amide compound with an alcohol, and continuous feed of an aqueous alcohol to the reaction mixture while the formed hydroxycarbonyl compound is distilled (see JP-A-6-247896), etc.<br>

1.152g (6.65 mmol) of vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCI3), 298g of acetic acid and 15.7g (132.9 mmol) of methyl α-hydroxybutanoate were put in an autoclave having a content volume of 400ml, and the mixture was warmed to 40°C under stirring. Pressurized air was introduced into the mixture to raise the pressure to 0.49 MPa, and reaction was carried out at that temperature for 5 hours while air was bubbled thereinto at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The result of analysis of the reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 2.<br><reference examples and> Results of reaction depending on the concentration of a starting compound in reaction wherein vanadium oxytrichloride and ethyl acetate were used<br><br>
0.110g (0.635 mmol) of vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCI3), 28g of ethyl acetate and 1.5g (12.8 mmol) of methyl α-hydroxybutanoate were put in a three-necked flask having a content volume of 100ml, and the mixture was warmed to 25°C under stirring. The mixture was stirred at that temperature for 1.5 hours in an atmosphere of oxygen (0.1 MPa) to react (Reference example 2). The result of analysis of the reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 2.<br>
On the hand, 0.520g (2.54 mmol) of vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCl3), 6.0g (50.8 mmol) of methyl α-hydroxybutanoate and 24g of ethyl acetate were put in a three-necked flask having a content volume of 100ml, and the mixture was warmed to 25°C under stirring. The mixture was stirred at that temperature for 3 hours in an atmosphere of oxygen (0.1 MPa) to react (Reference example 3). The result of analysis of the reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
From the results of Examples 1 to 8, the process of the present invention can be said to be an industrially advantageous process for producing an α -oxocarbonyl compound since good conversion ratio and good selectivity can be attained even when the concentration of the starting compound in the reaction system is 5 % by mass or more. Further, as apparent from the results of Reference examples 1 to 3, when vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCl3) was used as the vanadium compound, in the acetic acid solvent, conversion ratio is low in the case of the concentration of the starting compound being 5 % by mass (see Reference example 1), and, on the other hand, in the ethyl acetate solvent, although both conversion ratio and selectivity are good in the case of the concentration of the starting compound being 5 % by mass (see Reference example 2), selectivity largely decreases and thus yield decreases in the case of the concentration of the starting compound being raised from 5 % by mass to 20 % by mass (see Reference example 3). From this, it is understood that, by using a carboxylic acid as a solvent and the aforementioned particular vanadium compound, it becomes possible to produce the α-oxocarbonyl compound in good efficiency and in a high yield with high concentration of the starting material. <example><br>
0.050g (0.424 mmol) of ammonium metavanadate, 20g of acetic acid, 0.43g (4.24 mmol) of acetic anhydride and 8.8g (42.4 mmol) of ethyl α -hydroxy-γ -phenylbutanoate were put in a three-necked flask having a content volume of 100ml, and the mixture was warmed to 40°C under stirring. The mixture was stirred at that temperature for 8 hours in an atmosphere of oxygen (0.1 MPa) to react. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3. <example><br>
Reaction was carried out in the same way as in Example 9, except that 6.2g (42.4 mmol) of ethyl α-hydroxypentanoate was added in place of 8.8g (42.4 mmol)<br><br>
of ethyl α -hydroxy- γ -phenylbutanoate. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3. <example><br>
Reaction was carried out in the same way as in Example 9, except that 5.0g (42.4 mmol) of methyl α-hydroxybutanoate was added in place of 8.8g (42.4 mmol) of ethyl α -hydroxy- γ -phenylbutanoate. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3. <example><br>
Reaction was carried out in the same way as in Example 9, except that 6.7g of acetic acid and further 13.3g of ethyl acetate were used in place of 20g of acetic acid. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3. <comparative example> Reaction wherein a carboxylic acid was not used<br>
Reaction was carried out in the same way as in Example 9, except that 20g of ethyl acetate was used as a solvent in place of 20g of acetic acid. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3. <comparative example> Reaction wherein a carboxylic acid was not used<br>
Reaction was carried out in the same way as in Example 9, except that 20g of acetonitrile was used as a solvent in place of 20g of acetic acid. The result of analysis of the resulting reaction mixture by gas chromatography is shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
From the results of Table 3, it is understood that, when the concentration of the starting compound is high, reaction scarcely progress without using the combination of the aforementioned particular vanadium compound and a carboxylic acid, as in the process of the present invention. <example> Recovery of the carboxylic acid and reuse thereof<br>
32.8g of components initially distilled by vacuum distillation (58°C/13.3kPa) from 318.0g of the reaction mixture obtained in Example 1 was discarded, and 216.2g of acetic acid (water content 23,000 ppm) was then obtained by vacuum distillation (61°C/13.3kPa). 31.0g (303.9 mmol, corresponding 1.1 times the equivalent of water contained in the recovered acetic acid) of acetic anhydride was added to the recovered acetic acid, and the mixture was heated at 100°C for 4 hours to obtain 246.6g of acetic acid having a water content of 840 ppm.<br>
0.459g (3.92 mmol) of ammonium metavanadate, 240g of the recovered acetic acid and 61. lg (517.2 mmol) of methyl α -hydroxybutanoate were put in an autoclave having a content volume of 400ml, and the mixture was warmed to 40°C under stirring. Pressurized air was introduced into the mixture to raise the pressure to 0.49 MPa, and reaction was carried out at that temperature for 8 hours while air was bubbled thereinto at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography to indicate that the conversion ratio of methyl α- hydroxybutanoate was 99 % or more and the selectivity of methyl (X -oxobutanoate was 88 %.<br>
From Example 13, it is understood that, in the present invention, the recovered carboxylic acid or the solution of carboxylic acid and solvent, which are obtained by recovery of the carboxylic acid or the solution of carboxylic acid and solvent, and succeeding removal of impurities such as water formed as a byproduct from the recovered carboxylic acid or solution of the carboxylic acid and the solvent, can be reused in the present reaction with maintained result.<br>
