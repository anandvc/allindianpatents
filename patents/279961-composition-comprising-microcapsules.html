				<td>COMPOSITION COMPRISING MICROCAPSULES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present application relates to a composition comprising perfume microcapsules and the<br>
stability thereof in detergent compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Benefit agents, such as perfumes, silicones, waxes, flavors, vitamins and fabric softening<br>
agents, are expensive and generally less cost effective when employed at high levels in personal<br>
care compositions, cleaning compositions, and fabric care compositions. As a result, there is a<br>
desire to maximize the effectiveness of such benefit agents. One method of achieving such an<br>
objective is to improve the delivery efficiency and active lifetime of the benefit agent. This can<br>
be achieved by providing the benefit agent as a component of a microcapsule.<br>
Microcapsules provide several benefits. They have the benefit of protecting the benefit<br>
agent from physical or chemical reactions with incompatible ingredients in the composition,<br>
volatilization or evaporation. Microcapsules have the further advantage in that they can deliver<br>
the benefit agent to the substrate and can be designed to rupture under desired conditions, such<br>
as when a fabric becomes dry. Microcapsules can be particularly effective in the delivery and<br>
preservation of perfumes. Perfumes can be delivered to and retained within the fabric by a<br>
microcapsule that only ruptures, and therefore releases the perfume, when the fabric is dry.<br>
Microcapsules are made either by supporting the benefit agent on a water-insoluble<br>
porous carrier or by encapsulating the benefit agent in a water-insoluble shell. In the latter<br>
category microencapsulates are made by precipitation and deposition of polymers at the<br>
interface, such as in coacervates, for example as disclosed in GB-A-0 751 600., US-A- 3 341<br>
466 and EP-A-0 385 534, or other polymerisation routes such as interfacial condensation US-A-<br>
3 577 515, US-A-2003/0 125222, US-A-6 020 066, W02003/101606, US-A-5 066 419. A<br>
particularly useful means of encapsulation is using the melamine/urea - formaldehyde<br>
condensation reaction as described in US-A-3 516 941, US-A-5 066 419 and US-A-5 154 842.<br>
Such capsules are made by first emulsifying a benefit agent in small droplets in a pre-condensate<br>
medium obtained by the reaction of melamine/urea and formaldehyde and then allowing the<br>
polymerisation reaction to proceed along with precipitation at the oil-water interface. The<br>
encapsulates range in size from a few micrometer to a millimeter are then obtained in a<br>
suspension form in an aqueous medium.<br>
However, the most challenging problem with respect to the incorporation of<br>
microcapsules in detergent compositions is their stability. The perfume leaks from within the<br>
microcapsule over time. This is especially true when the composition comprises surfactant and<br>
solvent as most detergent compositions do. The applicant has surprisingly found a solution to<br>
this problem in the construction of the perfume composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a liquid detergent composition comprising<br>
a) less than 20% by weight water;<br>
b) 10% to 89.9 % of one or more components comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having<br>
more than 6 carbons;<br>
c) 10% to 60% by weight of water-miscible organic solvent having a molecular weight<br>
greater than 70; and<br>
d) perfume microcapsules, wherein the perfume contained within the microcapsules<br>
comprises<br>
i) 1 % to 30% of the perfume raw materials have ClogP less than 3 and boiling<br>
point less than 250°C and<br>
ii) more than 70% of the perfume raw materials are selected from the group<br>
consisting of those having ClogP greater than 3 or ClogP less than 3, with a<br>
boiling point of greater than 250°C.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The liquid compositions of the present invention are preferably suitable for use as hard<br>
surface cleaning, but preferably laundry treatment compositions.<br>
The term liquid is meant to include viscous or fluid liquids with newtonian or non-<br>
Newtonian rheology and gels. Said composition may be packaged in a container or as an<br>
encapsulated unitized dose. The latter form is described in more detail below. The liquid<br>
compositions are essentially non-aqueous. By non-aqueous it is understood that the<br>
compositions of the present invention comprise less than 20% total water, preferably from 1 to<br>
15%, most preferably from 1 to 10% total water. By total water it is understood to mean bothfree<br>
and bound water. Compositions used in unitized dose products comprising a liquid<br>
composition enveloped within a water-soluble film are often described to be non-aqueous.<br>
The compositions of the present invention preferably have viscosity from 1 to 10000<br>
centipoises (1-10000 mPa*s), more preferably from 100 to 7000 centipoises (100-7000 mPa*s),<br>
and most preferably from 200 to 1500 centipoises (200-1500 mPa*s) at 20s 1 and 21°C.<br>
Viscosity can be determined by conventional methods. Viscosity, according to the present<br>
invention, however is measured using an AR 550 rheometer from TA instruments using a plate<br>
steel spindle at 40 mm diameter and a gap size of 500 mih.<br>
Microcapsule<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises perfume microcapsules. The<br>
microcapsule preferably comprises a core material and a wall material that at least partially<br>
surrounds said core.<br>
In one aspect, at least 75%, 85% or even 90% of said microcapsules may have a particle<br>
size of from about 1 microns to about 80 microns, about 5 microns to 60 microns, from about 10<br>
microns to about 50 microns, or even from about 15 microns to about 40 microns. In another<br>
aspect, at least 75%, 85% or even 90% of said benefit agent delivery particles may have a<br>
particle wall thickness of from about 60 nm to about 250 nm, from about 80 nm to about 180<br>
nm, or even from about 100 nm to about 160 nm.<br>
In one aspect, said microcapsule wall material may comprise a suitable resin including<br>
the reaction product of an aldehyde and an amine, suitable aldehydes include, formaldehyde.<br>
Suitable amines include melamine, urea, benzoguanamine, glycoluril, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable melamines include, methylol melamine, methylated methylol melamine, imino<br>
melamine and mixtures thereof. Suitable ureas include, dimethylol urea, methylated dimethylol<br>
urea, urea-resorcinol, and mixtures thereof. Suitable materials for making may be obtained from<br>
one or more of the following companies Solutia Inc. (St Louis, Missouri U.S.A.), Cytec<br>
Industries (West Paterson, New Jeresy U.S.A.), sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri U.S.A.). It<br>
has been found that it is possible to prepare microcapsules comprising a melamine- 5<br>
formaldehyde aminoplast terpolymer containing polyol moieties, and especially aromatic polyol<br>
moieties. There are therefore provided microcapsules comprising a core of perfume, and a shell<br>
of aminoplast polymer, the composition of the shell being from 75-100% of a thermoset resin<br>
comprising 50-90%, preferably from 60-85%, of a terpolymer and from 10-50%, preferably<br>
from 10-25%, of a polymeric stabilizer; the terpolymer comprising: (a) from 20-60%, preferably<br>
30-50% of moieties derived from at least one polyamine, (b) from 3-50%, preferably 5-25% of<br>
moieties derived from at least one aromatic polyol; and (c) from 20-70%, preferably 40-60% of<br>
moieties selected from the group consisting of alkylene and alkylenoxy moieties having 1 to 6<br>
methylene units, preferably 1 to 4 methylene units and most preferably a methylene unit,<br>
dimethoxy methylene and dimethoxy methylene. By "moiety" is meant a chemical entity,<br>
which is part of the terpolymer and which is derived from a particular molecule. Example of<br>
suitable polyamine moieties include, but are not limited to, those derived from urea, melamine,<br>
3-substituted 1,5- 30 diamino-2,4,6-triazin and glycouril. Examples of suitable aromatic polyol<br>
moieties include, but are not limited to, those derived from phenol, 3,5-dihydroxy toluene,<br>
Bisphenol A, resorcinol, hydroquinone, xylenol, polyhydroxy naphthalene and polyphenols<br>
produced by the degradation of cellulose and humic acids.<br>
The use of the term "derived from" does not necessarily mean that the moiety in the<br>
terpolymer is directly derived from the substance itself, although this may be (and often is) the<br>
case. In fact, one of the more convenient methods of preparing the terpolymer involves the use<br>
of alkylolated polyamines as starting materials; these combine in a single molecule both the<br>
moieties (a) and (c) mentioned hereinabove.<br>
Suitable alkylolated polyamines encompass mixtures of mono- or polyalkylolated<br>
polyamines, which in turn may be partially alkylated with alcohols having from 1 to 6<br>
methylene units. Alkylated polyamines especially suitable for the sake of the present invention<br>
include mono- and polymethylol-urea pre-condensates, such as those commercially available<br>
under the Trade Mark URAC (ex Cytec Technology Corp.) and/or partially methylated monoand<br>
polymethylol-l,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-triazine pre- condensates, such as those commercially<br>
available under the Trade Mark CYMEL (ex Cytec Technology Corp.) or LURACOLL (ex<br>
BASF), and/or mono- and polyalkylol- benzoguanamine pre-condensates, and/or mono- and<br>
polyalkylol-glycouril pre- condensates. These alkylolated polyamines may be provided in<br>
partially alkylated forms, obtained by addition of short chain alcohols having typically 1 to 6<br>
methylene units. These partially alkylated forms are known to be less reactive and therefore<br>
more stable during storage. Preferred polyalkylol-polyamines are polymethylol-melamines and<br>
polymethylol- l-(3,5-dihydroxy-methylbenzyl)-3,5-triamino-2,4,6-triazine.<br>
A polymeric stabilizer may be used to prevent the microcapsules from agglomerating,<br>
thus acting as a protective colloid. It is added to the monomer mixture prior to polymerisation,<br>
and this results in its being partially retained by the polymer. Particular examples of suitable<br>
polymeric stabilizers include acrylic copolymers bearing sulfonate groups, such as those<br>
available commercially under the trade mark LUPASOL (ex BASF), such as LUPASOL PA 140<br>
or LUPASOL VFR; copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid, copolymers of alkyl acrylates<br>
and N-vinylpyrrolidone, such as those available under the trade mark Luviskol (e.g. LUVISKOL<br>
K 15, K 30 or K 90 ex BASF); sodium polycarboxylates (ex Polyscience Inc.) or sodium<br>
poly(styrene sulfonate) (ex Polyscience Inc.); vinyl and methyl vinyl ether - maleic anhydride<br>
copolymers (e.g. AGRIMER™ VEMA™ AN, ex ISP), and ethylene, isobutylene or<br>
styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers. Hence the preferred polymer stabilizers are anionic<br>
polyelectrolytes.<br>
Microcapsules of the type hereinabove described are manufactured in the form of an aqueous<br>
slurry, having typically 20 to 50% solids content, and more typically 30 to 45% solid content,<br>
where the term "solids content" refers to the total weight of the microcapsules. The slurry may<br>
contain formulation aids, such as stabilizing and viscosity control hydrocolloids, biocides, and<br>
additional formaldehyde scavengers.<br>
Typically, hydrocolloids or emulsifiers are used during the emulsification process of a<br>
perfume. Such colloids improve the stability of the slurry against coagulation, sedimentation<br>
and creaming. The term "hydrocolloid" refers to a broad class of water-soluble or waterdispersible<br>
polymers having anionic, cationic, zwitterionic or non-ionic character. Said<br>
hydrocolloids/emulsifiers may comprise a moiety selected from the group consisting of carboxy,<br>
hydroxyl, thiol, amine, amide and combination thereof. Hydrocolloids useful for the sake of the<br>
present invention encompass: polycarbohydrates, such as starch, modified starch, dextrin,<br>
maltodextrin, and cellulose derivatives, and their quaternized forms; natural gums such as<br>
alginate esters, carrageenan, xanthanes, agar-agar, pectines, pectic acid, and natural gums such<br>
as gum arabic, gum tragacanth and gum karaya, guar gums and quaternized guar gums; gelatine,<br>
protein hydrolysates and their quaternized forms; synthetic polymers and copolymers, such as<br>
poly(vinyl pyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate), poly((met)acrylic<br>
acid), poly(maleic acid), poly(alkyl(meth)acrylate-co-(meth)acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acid-comaleic<br>
acid)copolymer, poly(alkyleneoxide), poly(vinylmethylether), poly(vinylether-co-maleic<br>
anhydride), and the like, as well as poly-(ethyleneimine), poly((meth)acrylamide),<br>
poly(alkyleneoxide-co-dimethylsiloxane), poly(amino dimethylsiloxane), and the like, and their<br>
quartenized forms. In one aspect, said emulsifier may have a pKa of less than 5, preferably<br>
greater than 0, but less than 5. Emulsifiers include acrylic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers,<br>
poly(acrylic acid), polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty esters, polyalkylene co-carboxy anhydrides,<br>
poly alkylen co-maleic anhydrides, poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride),<br>
poly(butadiene co-maleic acnhydride), and poly(vinyl acetate-co-maleic anhydride), polyvinyl<br>
alcohols, polyealkylene glycols, polyoxyalkylene glycols and mixtures thereof. Most preferably<br>
the hydrocolloid is polyacrylic acid or modified polyacrylic acid. The pKa of the colloids is<br>
preferably between 4 and 5, and hence the capsule has a negative charge when the PMC slurry<br>
has pH above 5.0.<br>
The microcapsules preferably comprise a nominal shell to core mass ratio lower than<br>
15%, preferably lower than 10% and most preferably lower than 5%. Hence, the microcapsules<br>
may have extremely thin and frangible shells. The shell to core ratio is obtained by measuring<br>
the effective amount of encapsulated perfume oil microcapsules that have been previously<br>
washed with water and separated by filtration. This is achieved by extracting the wet<br>
microcapsule cake by microwave- enhanced solvent extraction and subsequent gas<br>
chromatographic analysis of the extract.<br>
Most preferably the perfume is encapsulated within an aminoplast capsule, the capsule<br>
shell comprising urea-formaldehyde or melamine-formaldehyde polymer. More preferably the<br>
microcapsule is further coated or partially coated in a second polymer comprising a polymer or<br>
copolymer of one or more anhydrides (such as maleic anhydride or ethylene/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer).<br>
The microcapsules of the present invention may be positively or negatively charged.<br>
However it is preferred that the microcapsules of the present invention are negatively charged<br>
and have a zeta potential of from -0.1 meV to -lOOmeV, when dispersed in deionized water. By<br>
"zeta potential" (z) it is meant the apparent electrostatic potential generated by any electrically<br>
charged objects in solution, as measured by specific measurement techniques. A detailed<br>
discussion of the theoretically basis and practical relevance of the zeta-potential can be found,<br>
e.g., in "Colloid Science: Zeta Potential in Colloid Sciences: Principles and Applications"<br>
(Hunter Robert J.; Editor.; Publisher (Academic Press, London); 1981; p 1988). The zetapotential<br>
of an object is measured at some distance from the surface of the object and is<br>
generally not equal to and lower than the electrostatic potential at the surface itself.<br>
Nevertheless, its value provides a suitable measure of the capability of the object to establish<br>
electrostatic interactions with other objects present in the solution, especially with molecules<br>
with multiple binding sites. The zeta-potential is a relative measurement and its value depends<br>
on the way it is measured. In the present case, the zeta-potential of the microcapsules is<br>
measured by the so-called phase analysis light scattering method, using a Malvern Zetasizer<br>
equipment (Malvern Zetasizer 3000; Malvern Instruments Ltd; Worcestershire UK, WR14<br>
1XZ). The zeta potential of a given object may also depend on the quantity of ions present in<br>
the solution. The values of the zeta-potential specified in the present application are measured in<br>
deionized water, where only the counter-ions of the charged microcapsules are present.<br>
More preferably the microcapsules of the present invention have zeta potential of - lOmeV to -<br>
80 meV, and most preferred from - 20meV to 75meV.<br>
Zeta Potential: For purposes of the present specification and claims, zeta potential is<br>
determined as follows:<br>
a.) Equipment: Malvern Zetasizer 3000<br>
b.) Procedure for sample preparation:<br>
(i) Add 5 drops of slurry containing the encapsulate of interest to 20mL<br>
ImM NaCl solution to dilute the slurry. The concentration may need<br>
adjustment to make the count rate in the range of 50 to 300 Kcps.<br>
(ii) the zeta potential is measured on the diluted sample without filtration<br>
(iii) inject the filtered slurry in the Zetasizer cell and insert the cell in the<br>
equipment. Test temperature is set at 25°C.<br>
(iv) when the temperature is stable (usually in 3 to 5 minutes), measurement is<br>
started. For each sample, five measurements are taken. Three samples<br>
are taken for each slurry of interest. The average of the 15 readings is<br>
calculated.<br>
c.) Equipment settings for the measurements:<br>
Parameters settings for the sample used:<br>
Material : melamine RI 1,680, absorption 0.10<br>
Dispersant: NaCl ImM<br>
Temperature: 25°C<br>
Viscosity: 0.8900 cP<br>

Dielecectric constant: 100<br>
F(ka) selection: Model: Smoluchowski F(ka) 1.5<br>
Use dispersant viscosity as sample viscosity<br>
Cell type: DTS1060C: clear disposable Zeta cells<br>
Measurements: 3 measurements<br>
d.) Results: Zeta potential is reported in mV as the average of the 15<br>
readings taken for the slurry of interest.<br>

Process of Making Microcapsules and Slurry Containing Microcapsules<br>
Microcapsules are commercially available. Processes of making said microcapsules is<br>
described in the art. More particular processes for making suitable microcapsules are disclosed<br>
in US 6,592,990 B2 and/or US 6,544,926 Bl and the examples disclosed herein.<br>
The composition resulting from this manufacturing process is a slurry. Said slurry<br>
comprises microcapsules, water and precursor materials for making the microcapsules. The<br>
slurry may comprise other minor ingredients, such as an activator for the polymerization process<br>
and/or a pH buffer. To the slurry, a formaldehyde scavenger may be added.<br>
Components comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having more than 6 carbons<br>
Composition according got the present invention comprise 10% to 89.9 % of one or more<br>
components comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having more than 6 carbons. More preferably<br>
the composition comprises from more 20% to 80%, more preferably from 30% to 70% by<br>
weight of the composition of one or more components comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having<br>
more than 6 carbons.<br>
Although not limited to surfactants, the component comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains<br>
having more than 6 carbons is preferably a surfactant. The surfactant utilized can be of the<br>
anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampholytic or cationic type or can comprise compatible mixtures<br>
of these types. More preferably surfactants are selected from the group consisting of anionic,<br>
nonionic, cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof. Preferably the compositions are<br>
substantially free of betaine surfactants. Detergent surfactants useful herein are described in<br>
U.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, U.S. Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin et al.,<br>
issued December 30, 1975, U.S. Patent 4,222,905, Cockrell, issued September 16, 1980, and in<br>
U.S. Patent 4,239,659, Murphy, issued December 16, 1980. Anionic and nonionic surfactants<br>
are preferred.<br>
Useful anionic surfactants can themselves be of several different types. For example,<br>
water-soluble salts of the higher fatty acids, i.e., "soaps", are useful anionic surfactants in the<br>
compositions herein. This includes alkali metal soaps such as the sodium, potassium,<br>
ammonium, and alkyl ammonium salts of higher fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 24<br>
carbon atoms, and preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. Soaps can be made by<br>
direct saponification of fats and oils or by the neutralization of free fatty acids. Particularly<br>
useful are the sodium and potassium salts of the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil<br>
and tallow, i.e., sodium or potassium tallow and coconut soap. Soaps also have a useful building<br>
function.<br>
Additional non-soap anionic surfactants which are suitable for use herein include the<br>
water-soluble salts, preferably the alkali metal, and ammonium salts, of organic sulfuric reaction<br>
products having in their molecular structure an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 20<br>
carbon atoms, a sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid ester group and optional alkoxylation. (Included in<br>
the term "alkyl" is the alkyl portion of acyl groups.) Examples of this group of synthetic<br>
surfactants are a) the sodium, potassium and ammonium alkyl sulfates, especially those obtained<br>
by sulfating the higher alcohols (C 8-Ci 8 carbon atoms) such as those produced by reducing the<br>
glycerides of tallow or coconut oil; b) the sodium, potassium and ammonium alkyl<br>
polyethoxylate sulfates, particularly those in which the alkyl group contains from 10 to 22,<br>
preferably from 12 to 18 carbon atoms, and wherein the polyethoxylate chain contains from 1 to<br>
15, preferably 1 to 6 ethoxylate moieties; and c) the sodium and potassium alkylbenzene<br>
sulfonates in which the alkyl group contains from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms, in straight<br>
chain or branched chain configuration, e.g., those of the type described in U.S. Patents<br>
2,220,099 and 2,477,383. Especially valuable are linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates<br>
in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 13,<br>
abbreviated as C11-C1 3 LAS.<br>
Preferred nonionic surfactants are those of the formula R1(OC2H 4)nOH, wherein R1 is a<br>
C 10-C16 alkyl group or a C 8-Ci 2 alkyl phenyl group, and n is from 3 to about 80. Particularly<br>
preferred are condensation products of C12-C15 alcohols with from about 5 to about 20 moles of<br>
ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, e.g., C12-C13 alcohol condensed with about 6.5 moles of<br>
ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.<br>
The weight ratio of the component comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having more than 6<br>
carbons to water-miscible organic solvent with molecular weight of greater than 70 is preferably<br>
from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:6 to 6:1, still more preferably from 1:5 to 5:1, e.g.<br>
from 1:3 to 3:1.<br>
Water-miscible organic solvent<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise from 10% to 60% of a watermiscible<br>
organic solvent having a molecular weight of greater than 70. Preferably the solvent is<br>
present in the composition at a level of from 20% to 50% by weight of water-miscible organic<br>
solvent having a molecular weight greater than 70.<br>
Preferred such solvents include ethers, polyethers, alkylamines and fatty amines,<br>
(especially di- and tri-alkyl- and/or fatty-N- substituted amines), alkyl (or fatty) amides and<br>
mono- and di- N-alkyl substituted derivatives thereof, alkyl (or fatty) carboxylic acid lower alkyl<br>
esters, ketones, aldehydes, polyols, and glycerides.<br>
Specific examples include respectively, di-alkyl ethers, polyethylene glycols, alkyl<br>
ketones (such as acetone) and glyceryl trialkylcarboxylates (such as glyceryl tn- acetate),<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, and sorbitol.<br>
Other suitable solvents include higher (C5 or more, eg C5 - Cg) alkanols such as<br>
hexanol. Lower (CI - C4) alkanols are also useable although they are less preferred and<br>
therefore, if present at all, are preferably used in amounts below 20% by weight of the total<br>
composition, more preferably less than 10% by weight, still more preferably less than 5% by<br>
weight. Alkanes and olefins are yet other suitable solvents. Any of these solvents can be<br>
combined with solvent materials which are surfactants and non-surfactants having the<br>
aforementioned "preferred" kinds of molecular structure. Even though they appear not to play a<br>
role in the deflocculation process, it is often desirable to include them for lowering the viscosity<br>
of the product and/or assisting soil removal during cleaning.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the present invention. Percentages are by<br>
weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Example 1 - Method of Making a Perfume Microcapsule<br>
The microcapsule produced comprises 80 % by weight core and 20% by weight wall melamine<br>
formaldehyde capsule.<br>
18.grams of a blend of 50% butyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer emulsifier (Colloid C351,<br>
25% solids, pka 4.5-4.7, Kemira) and 50% polyacrylic acid (35% solids, pKa 1.5-2.5, Aldrich) is<br>
dissolved and mixed in 200 grams deionized water. The pH of the solution is adjusted to pH of<br>
3.5 with sodium hydroxide solution. 6.5 grams of partially methylated methylol melamine resin<br>
(Cymel 385, 80% solids Cytec) is added to the emulsifier solution. 200 grams of perfume oil is<br>
added to the previous mixture under mechanical agitation and the temperature is raised to 60° C.<br>
After mixing at higher speed until a stable emulsion is obtained, the second solution and 3.5<br>
grams of sodium sulfate salt are poured into the emulsion. This second solution contains 10<br>
grams of butyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer emulsifier (Colloid C351, 25% solids, pka 4.5-<br>
4.7, Kemira), 120 grams of distilled water, sodium hydroxide solution to adjust pH to 4.6, 30<br>
grams of partially methylated methylol melamine resin (Cymel 385, 80% Cytec). This mixture is<br>
heated to 85° C. and maintained 8 hours with continuous stirring to complete the encapsulation<br>
process. 23 grams of acetoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Mo., U.S.A.) is added to the<br>
suspension.<br>
Example 2 - Method of Making a Perfume Microcapsule<br>
Preparation of a melamine formaldehyde capsule comprising 84wt% Core and 16wt% Wall.<br>
25 grams of butyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer emulsifier (Colloid C351, 25% solids, pka<br>
4.5-4.7, (Kemira Chemicals, Inc. Kennesaw, Georgia U.S.A.) is dissolved and mixed in 200<br>
grams deionized water. The pH of the solution is adjusted to pH of 4.0 with sodium hydroxide<br>
solution. 8 grams of partially methylated methylol melamine resin (Cymel 385, 80% solids,<br>
(Cytec Industries West Paterson, New Jersey, U.S.A.)) is added to the emulsifier solution. 200<br>
grams of perfume oil is added to the previous mixture under mechanical agitation and the<br>
temperature is raised to 50 °C. After mixing at higher speed until a stable emulsion is obtained,<br>
the second solution and 4 grams of sodium sulfate salt are added to the emulsion. This second<br>
solution contains 10 grams of butyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer emulsifier (Colloid C351,<br>
25% solids, pka 4.5-4.7, Kemira), 120 grams of distilled water, sodium hydroxide solution to<br>
adjust pH to 4.8, 25 grams of partially methylated methylol melamine resin (Cymel 385, 80%<br>
solids, Cytec). This mixture is heated to 70 °C and maintained overnight with continuous<br>
stirring to complete the encapsulation process. 23 grams of acetoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich,<br>
Saint Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.) is added to the suspension. An average capsule size of 30um is<br>
obtained as analyzed by a Model 780 Accusizer.<br>
Example 3 - Sample Preparation and Leakage Test<br>
Perfume microcapsule, described above in example 2 are made with Perfume oil 1. 1.8g of the<br>
perfume microcapsules containing 30% perfume oil were mixed with 50g of formulations A (as<br>
detailed below) in glass jars (size of 100 mL).<br>
The glass jars are closed and stored in an oven at 37°C for two weeks. After two weeks the<br>
samples are taken out of the oven and the amount of perfume leaked out from the capsules was<br>
determined by measuring headspace over 5g of the mixture in a 20 mL headspace vial.<br>
Head-space analysis<br>
5grams of the detergent mixture is placed in a 20 mL headspace vial and the vial is capped. All<br>
samples vial are put on an autosampler tray of the Static Headspace sampler type HP7694<br>
(Hewlett Packard, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Prior to the headspace analysis, each<br>
sample is pre-conditioned for 30 minutes at 40°C. A headspace loop of 3 mL is transferred (via<br>
inert transfer line at 80°C) onto GC-MS system. GC-analysis is conducted on apolar capillary<br>
column (DB-5, 30 meters x 0.25 mm, 1 micron thickness) and headspace constituents (i.e. the<br>
perfume raw materials) are monitored by Mass Spectrometry (EI, 70eV detector).<br>
Leakage is determined comparing the headspace responses for both reference containing<br>
perfume oil (free perfume without microcapsules) and product containing perfume<br>
microcapsule. The percent leakage is calculated on the basis of % contribution of each<br>
individual perfume raw material and the total perfume leakage is the sum of all % leakage of<br>
each individual perfume raw materials.<br>

From the above examples it can be seen that quadrant 1 perfumes having ClogP less than 3 and<br>
boiling point less than 250°C show the most leakage. Perfume microcapsule showing a balance<br>
of leakage is desired. However that leakage should be controlled such that you achieve<br>
sufficient leakage to provide a pleasant odour in the container headspace, yet also maintain the<br>
majority of the perfume in the PMC for deposit onto the fabric.<br>
